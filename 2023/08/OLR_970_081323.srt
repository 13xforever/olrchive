00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,960
Devolver Digital presents Devolver Delayed! Devolver Digital delayed delights that need

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,280
more development. Developers decided to dedicate more days to deploying their delight. Despite

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,120
the delay, more days should allow for improved design and increased delight. There are a

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,000
lot of synonyms that start with the letter D. Hopefully decade doesn't become one of

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,680
the relevant ones. This is the intro brought to you by the letter D. Now it's time for

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,520
your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you the details of this D story

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,760
and the rest of the week's gaming news. Study tonight now on the show where every gamer

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
has a voice.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,320
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,920
number 970 of our show for tonight, August the 13th of 2023. Yes, we're back after an

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,440
unexpected two weeks. Well, one expected week off and then one unexpected week off. I'll

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,800
talk about that in a moment. But first, let's introduce ourselves. I am Rob Roberts. I'm

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,080
here every week joined by my co-hosts. Say hello first and foremost to the one and only

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,720
DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Hi.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,120
Hello. Or should I say the virtual, the V2 virtual tubing?

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm actually having to fix the setting real quick. There we go. I was like leaning over

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,980
for some reason. You know, gravity.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,280
And you can see visuals like this because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,720
o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,200
network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can see the visuals that go along

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,960
with the show. I mean, we do know we're a podcast and we make it audio only first. We

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,160
try very, very hard to not say things like, look at what's on the screen, you know, but

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,920
sometimes when there's something very much outside the ordinary, ordinary, we might stop

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,820
and point it out such as DarkSakura's VTuber, which I know you've used on your personal

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,080
streams here and there over on your Twitch channel. But I guess she's making her debut

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,760
on OLR tonight.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,240
And this is even a new look for my VTuber because I finally got my hair right.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,400
And how has the VTubing experience kind of been for those that may not know or maybe

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,760
understand VTubing?

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Well, it's been interesting because it's great that I don't have to put on makeup and change

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,840
out of my pajamas. So my skin has benefited from it. You know, it means I don't have to

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,880
have my my lights on all the time, which is also good. It's a but it's been kind of interesting

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:56,320
because I don't feel like this heavy judgment for how I look, you know, it's, I mean, that's

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,560
kind of the thing. It's great for introverts. And while I don't really mind being being

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,520
on camera, I do have those days where just I hurt, you know, and I don't want to or I'm

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,200
having like lately I've been having dizzy spells of migraines. So I haven't really had

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,760
a lot of the ability to get up. This shirt is clipping. I'm going to have to fix it.

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:26,880
But anyway, but it's also taught me a bit more about texturing just in 3D anyway, which

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:38,080
I was learning a bit of how to do that when I'm working in Daz. But overall, I've really,

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,280
you know, I think that camo is picking up my my audio too. And I should I normally have

43
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,280
that turned off. You actually sound completely fine on my end. But I think what is happening

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,960
unfortunately might have a little bit of a loop situation going on. I don't know why

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,920
my OBS is reverting some settings, but I think what I just did will fix it. So sorry about

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
that. Thank you live chat pointing that out. Sorry, audio folks. No, you sound fine. I

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,880
think it's on OBS's end. And I double checked my settings are fine. But at any rate, it's

48
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,480
been an overall positive experience. And I've been able to, you know, the thing I enjoy

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,240
about it really is customizing my clothes. Although the boobs are kind of hard to work

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,840
around just the way that they they sort of bend textures over it. But I'm learning to

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,440
deal with it. You know, I have I have all kinds of different cute stuff. I even have

52
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,960
like my ballet day outfit, which will be seen tomorrow, where I have a bun. And I have like

53
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,920
a leotard under a big shirt. And I borrowed an image from a sticker and I'll give them

54
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:52,800
full credit for it. But it's it has a ballerina with her feet in fifth position, which is

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:01,400
I can't do it on the camera. But and it says I plead the fifth to I also have one that

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,240
says May the fourth be with you. And it's a ballerina in fourth position with a lightsaber.

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,640
I see. I see. All right. Yeah. Funny. Funny. Quickly, before we introduce our other co

58
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,120
host here off of YouTube for a second, I wanted to mention quickly this because this was a

59
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,320
little bit newer for a Vogue network of something trying a little bit of an experiment trying

60
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,560
to create some additional content for our website and the network outside of just Sunday

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,660
nights as well as our affiliate podcasts. So on Thursday, we put together a couple of

62
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,080
videos that just went out on our YouTube channel. So we are creating some content that we do

63
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,160
mean to distribute and not keep exclusive to Twitch. And in all transparency and honesty,

64
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,620
it's just an effort to try to grow our network and have more content that's available for

65
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,520
consumption out there. So Shane and I got together to talk about Final Fantasy 14 Fanfest.

66
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,680
So you can check that out over on our YouTube channel. Or if you need the links, Vogue network.com

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,200
is a great place to start. And then Dark Sakura and I got together to talk about the new alien

68
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,840
DLC for Dead by Daylight that's coming. Oh, yeah, we took a deep dive on that because

69
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,640
Dark Sakura has some pretty strong opinions when it comes to alien or aliens inspired

70
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:20,480
DLC. And this is alien. No, I know. I know. Yeah. So but obviously, a lot of it's most

71
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,000
people are fond of both the first two movies. I don't see a lot of people defending the

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,080
third one out there. I like I actually like the third one. I like resurrection because

73
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,560
I love Winona Ryder. And I was like, if they're not going to get Sigourney Weaver, which they

74
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,240
didn't spoil I mean, they got Ripley was not Sigourney Weaver, right? It's a it's a made

75
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,920
for TV version. But it's pretty decent. We talked we talked about this in the video.

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,280
We talked about this video. But I was like, if they don't get that, I hope they get Winona

77
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,000
Ryder's character call or whatever her name was from resurrection, because then we can

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,680
get her that one. And then we can get Joyce Byer from Stranger Things. And we'd have Winona

79
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,680
and Winona on the same team. I'd love that. If they ever get the Stranger Things license

80
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,480
back. I know but that's what I want. I want Winona on Winona action. And to answer fifth

81
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,060
James question about Jonesy. Jonesy is in the game. Yep. As making little cameos. There

82
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,840
is a locker that you can open. That's near a jump scare area. I won't spoil that too

83
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:24,560
much. And he runs out of the locker going. And and he's also in Ripley's loading screen.

84
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,880
And she plays with him. He comes up from behind her and weaves through her legs and she leans

85
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,640
down and gives him scritches and then he gets scared and runs off.

86
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,000
I was gonna say I didn't think the fourth movie was terrible. I'm a little fond of it

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,020
because it was the first one I saw in the theater and it was by that, you know, alien

88
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,240
is a big director franchise, or at least it was right. And it was the guy that did the

89
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,080
City of Lost Children directed the fourth movie. So it's got a very stylistic look to

90
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,000
it. And it was written by at the time, this person was huge, obviously, some time and

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,280
some looking back, there's shown that this individual is not great. But Joss Whedon wrote

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
it, you know,

93
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,480
there's more drama behind that, because they changed the script a lot. Oh, okay. I thought

94
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:10,000
his there are there are places in there that have a lot of his original writing. But there's

95
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,400
there was quite a bit that was changed. So where it doesn't end up as quite his style

96
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,440
of movie, if that makes sense. So anyway, there's some drama, I would encourage you

97
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,080
to check out our YouTube channel if you're not already following it at of course, vog

98
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,760
network, vog network and check out all the latest Speaking of socials real quick, and

99
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,160
then our third host is sitting there so patiently. I will mention, we are also now on blue sky.

100
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,920
So for those of you that have decided, you know what billionaire platform, not for me

101
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,880
so much. We now have a presence on blue sky as well. And I'll let you guess where you

102
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,920
can find us on blue sky. Yes, it's vog network, although the way blue sky works, you can actually

103
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,040
get verified to your particular domain. So you actually look for vog network.com on blue

104
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,560
sky. And that's how you that's that's its version of a verified account is because it's

105
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,560
verified through the actual vog network domain. So but I'm pretty sure we're the only vog

106
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,760
network on blue sky as of right now. So all right. Anyhow, they have another invite code

107
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,800
somewhere if anyone needs it. Oh, yeah, it was funny. The vog network account got an

108
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,920
invite code to maybe I shouldn't say that. But you want to know what's great, though.

109
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,520
Because I'm because I'm on an Apple silicon Mac. I can run the blue sky app on my Mac

110
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,520
so I can actually play with it from my desktop. Oh, well, they have a website too. I mean,

111
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,400
yes, I just use the website. They do but it's kind of weird to get to they're really

112
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,640
pushing the app presence. I will say though, quick pro tip on blue sky, if you want to

113
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,760
change your content filters the way you want them, and I'm just going to be straight up

114
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,320
if you want to see adult content, you can't do that on the app due to App Store restrictions

115
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,160
on all platforms, not it's just all platforms. So you want to bring it up on the web to see

116
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,760
all of the content filtering options, because by default content filtering is on. So if

117
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,000
you want to see other stuff, you can go in and face it. But if you don't want to see

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,060
that stuff, you can also just turn the filters on the way you want them. That's one reason

119
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:14,040
I like blue sky a lot is that it is very customizable. Something it has that billionaires app doesn't

120
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,460
have is custom beats, which is pretty rad too. So it's it's it's it's a neat app. I

121
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,140
like where it's going. They've had some they've had some growing pains. Not everything has

122
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,820
been sunshine and rainbows, but it's much better than the alternative, in my opinion

123
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,460
so far. So all right, uh, let's say hello as well to of course the one and only tech

124
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:42,420
master Loki. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm tired. Yeah, tired. Busy weekend. It's been a whole

125
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,700
busy week. I've been just doing lots of stuff. Lots of things going on. Okay, hopefully something

126
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,380
we can hear about in the future. Yep, hopefully. All right. Next week. Okay, but here's what

127
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,460
the listeners really wanted over that I should say the viewers tonight over at vog network.

128
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,620
Why in the hell do you have that game playing behind you tonight? What is that? That's that's

129
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:10,560
the Sega hologram time travelers or time it is a time. Yes. It is because, uh, well, we've

130
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,700
done how many shows starting to run out of games? I don't know about that. Do you know

131
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,780
how many classic games dark soccer has picked over the years? Go to the Wiki page and just

132
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,260
start going in order from what she's picked. No, I picked it because like I remembered

133
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:35,100
that this game existed. Thankfully, I was not smart enough to play it. So, you know,

134
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:43,100
I don't know that it's awful, but, um, yeah, this ties in also to my, my final episode

135
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,500
of channel 64 as well. There's time travel involved. So, okay. Okay. I see what you're

136
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,580
doing. Very, very loose like connection there. But yeah, um, I don't know. You were promoting

137
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,260
something earlier on your socials about like a tour, like you were letting people come

138
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,740
on your island. How was, how was all of that for Minecraft? Yeah, we did a world tour and

139
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,780
it's actually still up if we're going to be keeping it up for a week. Um, but yeah, our

140
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,020
tour server, um, it, we invited people on, we, well, we first did like a podcast type

141
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,920
thing talking about season two and then we invited Ray on to like a world tour, had people

142
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,860
walk around. We, uh, went and played some of the mini games that we had set up during

143
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,860
the year and stuff. And, um, we had chaos at the same time. Someone teleported every

144
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:36,100
single entity in the game in one spot. That was fun. We had to fix that. I was worried

145
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,580
you'd get trolls or something that would want to do. No, no, we, we set it up. I mean,

146
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,460
our community's great. Um, it's set up as a, an adventure mode world. So anybody knew

147
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:51,260
that comes into it, it said they can't break it. I mean, the worst they could do is maybe

148
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,060
kill the ravagers or something. It, nothing that's like unfixable and it's just temporary

149
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,780
anyways. And it's not, it's a copy of our server. It's not like actually the server

150
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,940
that we play on. So, um, yeah, they can't really hurt anything, but it's more of like

151
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,060
to get to view stuff first person because like some of the builds you don't really understand

152
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,100
until you act like screenshots don't do them justice, but when you go and see them in person,

153
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,300
like, Whoa, these are huge or like these are really cool looking. Um, so it gives a chance

154
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,720
for people to kind of explore things at their pace and then plus there's going to be a world

155
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,380
download coming out at the end of next week when we start our third season. So, um, they

156
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,140
can check it out then too. And we're still working out kinks with stuff are none of our

157
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,140
resource packs work because apparently they changed the format of those. So that's great.

158
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:44,140
Wish I knew that a couple versions ago. Um, and just been trying to work through like

159
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,140
updating mods and everything like the proprietary mod that I made, I updated, but then the one

160
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:55,340
that works with that not updated. So we had to do some crazy workarounds to get things

161
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,260
to look fine on there. But I think it might be, I think it might be fun, uh, as a deep

162
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,260
dive video sometime, Loki, if, uh, you and I are you and somebody hop on there, I've

163
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,420
just been at some point, it won't always be me. I'm doing this to get it started. And

164
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,420
then other people might go, I want to do one. And then of course, this isn't the Rob show

165
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,060
it's fog network. So, um, but I think it would be great if you and I did a deep dive and

166
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,460
you could explain it from the perspective of, I haven't touched Minecraft in like 10

167
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,260
years. Like why, you know, what is it take to do something like this? And I'm like, I

168
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,740
think that'd be a lot of fun.

169
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,020
Lots of planning and then also lots of regret and burning yourself out because you committed

170
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,540
to something that was supposed to be going to the end of the year. And then we cut it

171
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,980
short by six months. And then instead of, you know, saying, oh, I'll just do less. You

172
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,780
just decide to cram more of it in a shorter time period and then have like, you know,

173
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,100
a whole week of sleepless nights because of this and yet to be announced things I can't

174
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,980
wait to, can't wait to talk about, but I cannot about them yet.

175
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:06,540
I know, I know them feels bro, but we will talk about that next week and how my life

176
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:15,340
flip upside down would say, uh, is it is going to be an insane month. That's for sure. A

177
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,940
very emotional, insane month for sure.

178
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,820
All right. Uh, some other comments on your video game, uh, playing in the background there,

179
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,460
time travelers tonight from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, pod culture

180
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,180
suggests you could run naughty bear or Yaris if you want to do a bad game. Uh, the break man

181
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,460
saying, LOL Yaris. I don't think Loki has ever done Yaris before. I think I'm pretty sure I've

182
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,220
done Yaris. I haven't done naughty bear. Um, I, yeah, it was more of just like, I was trying to

183
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,140
think of arcade games and I'm like, well, you know, I've done all these and I couldn't think of

184
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,460
any that like were interesting to me that I haven't done before polarizing that game is like

185
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,300
the brake man says it's the worst game I've ever played. As you went on to Matt says, that game is

186
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,220
hilarious. I'm assuming in a so bad, it's good kind of way. But questmaster says that was such a

187
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,820
bold game by Sega. And if you think about it, the technology really was like, it was some,

188
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,820
that's what made it even more disappointing. Cause you're like, wow, it's a hologram game. And he

189
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,700
played like, wow, this is awful, but it looks cool. Yeah. And you look at something like

190
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,940
dragon's lair, which I would consider dragon's lair kind of like the predecessor to that,

191
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,860
which is a great game. And like the Don Bluth, you know, animations, that whole series really,

192
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,500
but with space ace and all the other stuff, uh, that was incredible. And so I feel like they were

193
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,660
trying to emulate that in the hologram space kind of with this game. And it just, it wasn't the

194
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,860
same. They should have called Don Bluth. Yeah. It's like, it's hard with like full motion games

195
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,700
like that, where it's just like, okay, well, the, the gameplay is going to be jumping duck or left

196
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,780
and right. You know, it's, it's very like basic controls because they can't really change full

197
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,580
motion video nowadays. I mean, if you were to remake that, it would be just, you could do all

198
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:59,260
sorts of crazy stuff with that. So it's just the, it, you know, they did the best they could at the

199
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,900
time and it is what it is. All right. Well, uh, we're going to jump into our kickoff topic here

200
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,500
in a moment. I'm going to ask Loki to jump into it. Cause we usually like to try to get to gaming

201
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,020
right at the top of the show, but we do have a few things to catch up on. I just kind of want

202
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,460
to go over a few things because we haven't been here for two weeks. Um, so there's a few things

203
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,740
to talk about so quickly. Um, I was not here two weeks ago and this was planned because I was at

204
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,100
Southern fried gaming expo out in Atlanta, which was a lot of fun. Uh, basically it was a really

205
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:36,380
celebration of all different types of game forms, um, notably pinball console games, uh, classic

206
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,260
arcade room gaming. And, uh, it was a lot of fun. I will urge you to go check out the Bobby

207
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,220
black Wolf show from two weeks ago where we really took a deep dive on that. I was a surprise guest

208
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,420
on his show. I guess the only one to ever be in person because I was at his house literally.

209
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,740
Uh, so we did that show together two weeks ago. So that was a lot of fun. Um, and so we get into

210
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,220
a lot of the details there, but I did have a really good time at the show. Um, I, I really

211
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:06,140
wish I could justify the expense of traveling back so I could go say, yes, I'll be back next year.

212
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,940
I'm not going to say I'm not going to be there next year, but it's going to take a lot to get

213
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,220
me, you know, obviously with the, um, travel costs and all that. But if I lived in the state or I

214
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,900
lived in the Atlanta area, or even if I lived in Florida or something within driving range,

215
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,540
you bet I'd drive out and go to the show. Cause it was a fun time. You know, it was, it was that

216
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,860
a very similar, it was a good dragon con warmup because it had that very similar vibe of like

217
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,420
literally Bobby, Mrs. Black Wolf and I stayed up until 3 AM one night. I never left West coast

218
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:42,300
time pretty much. We stayed up until 3 AM one night playing a kingdom hearts, PVE card with no

219
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,940
dice game. Um, that was actually a lot of fun and we were having to learn the rules and everything.

220
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,340
And I got to play as Donald and I joked, I'm not going to heal anybody because I'm Donald.

221
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,220
Although the gag was, um, I actually ended up doing a lot of healing, uh, throughout the game.

222
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,780
And I, I feel like, I feel like you can't really do well at that game without Donald,

223
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,140
who was like the only one who could do direct healing. But anyway, I digress.

224
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,900
We had a lot of fun playing that game and kind of learning about that. I enjoyed, uh,

225
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,660
going through the classic game room and playing a lot of the classics. They had new tables there

226
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,940
too. Uh, Stern was in full force. They were showing off their new venom table. I didn't,

227
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,380
I didn't love the venom table. I think the venom table is probably great for people who love the

228
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,740
classics because it doesn't have as many bells and whistles. Like there's no, like there's no

229
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,980
third flipper on the venom table, which for some people are going to be like, good. That's how

230
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,380
pinball should be. Um, and that's, they'll like that table, but I liked the Foo Fighters table,

231
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,700
which I'd played before, but for the first time I got to play the double O seven, uh, table,

232
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,780
which is in two flavors, depending on which edition of the game it is. But I love the, um,

233
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,340
no one lives forever with a little, uh, James Bond and the helicopter pack that's around.

234
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,420
I thought that was so cool. So I love that. And they had the weird Al table, Dark Sakura,

235
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,420
uh, with the, and they had it flipped out. So do I. I know, right. I heard about that,

236
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,900
but they had one that was flipped out. Cause that pinball maker lets you flip out like the back

237
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,060
and for like another game. And so they were showing another game with that as well,

238
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,300
which I thought was pretty cool. Um, and then of course all the classics as well. Uh, I know I

239
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,380
played a space Harrier machine and I took a picture and send it to dark soccer and I put, look,

240
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,820
I'm entering the fantasy zone and getting ready. Get ready. That's right. So I played that, um,

241
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,180
uh, just, yeah, I played some really cool indie games. They had a little indie showcase,

242
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,100
but there was just some fun stuff that was being shown. I really hope there's some stuff that gets

243
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,660
to publishing and all of that. It was really good. I love the vintage computing expo and getting to

244
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:41,420
see like the old three 86 and four 86 computers that were playing doom, uh, and that were all land

245
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,500
together. So you can, and what was neat about it was that it was really kids sitting down and

246
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:52,300
playing it and, uh, playing those. So yeah, just lots of fun stuff to see just a real celebration

247
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,980
of gaming. Uh, and I had a lot of fun. Again, we have a very, very, very similar show out here

248
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,540
called California extreme, but I will say, and granted, I haven't been to California extreme in

249
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,140
a few years, Jamie, you've been more recently than I have. So correct me if I'm wrong, but

250
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,660
California extreme really focuses on the pinball and the classic games. I don't remember as much

251
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:18,060
board game stuff and like Pathfinder and things of that sort. The pinball stuff has actually gotten

252
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:25,020
bigger over time and they do. And they do also have the, um, the candy cabs with, uh,

253
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,940
the bullet hell games. Oh yeah. There were some of those that, um, Southern fried too, but yeah,

254
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,660
I just, the game room was definitely like bigger at California extreme. Like there was more variety,

255
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,940
but I don't want to pit the shows against each other. They're both a lot of fun.

256
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,460
They're just, there's subtle differences between them and that's okay. You want to see shows grow

257
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,100
into their own thing. So I just, I found Southern fried to be like a big like celebration of gaming

258
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,180
and yeah, I definitely encourage those in the Southeast part of the country to, uh,

259
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,980
put it on your agenda to go next year. Uh, I'm sure Bobby Black Wolf will be back as far as me.

260
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,220
I'm a question mark until I know what my finances and all that look like for next year and what I

261
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,460
may or may not get offered to do. We'll see. Um, now unexpectedly we weren't here last week

262
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:13,420
and that was pretty much the situation on my end. Um, my dad had to go to the emergency room on

263
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,060
Saturday and when we took them into the emergency room, it was pretty, it was sounding pretty

264
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,820
serious. The doctors were diagnosing him with sepsis when he first went in. Unfortunately,

265
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,700
he had an infection that got a little bit out of control, which was weird because he wasn't like

266
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,940
showing signs of something that was like completely out of control until, you know,

267
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,540
it was too late, so to speak, but I'm going to just fast forward to the end of this.

268
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,420
He's fine. Now the sepsis was not that they kind of caught it like right on the borderline

269
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:44,460
and were able to pump them full of antibiotics as one does. And, you know, my dad's 84. Like

270
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,900
he just, he, you know, you get infections easier at that age. He had had a procedure done. Um,

271
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,380
and I'm just going to say in a personal area, and that's why I'm not giving details because this is

272
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,460
my dad's business. He had a procedure done and unfortunately it let it potentially led to this

273
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,900
infection by, you know, um, dislodging things or, you know, whatever, just the way these things

274
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,420
happen. He didn't, you know, and my dad is still a little bit stubborn in his old age,

275
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,820
so he doesn't like to speak up that something's wrong until something's really wrong. And, uh,

276
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,540
so we took him into the ER and there was that. So I wasn't sure if he was going to get discharged

277
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,940
on Sunday or what was going on. So I kind of told my co-host like, Hey, I don't know what's

278
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:28,940
going to happen today. And so we just kind of decided, you know what, no show. And honestly,

279
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,380
I ended up appreciating just like having a weekend because my Saturday and Sunday morning

280
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,340
had been completely shot by everything that was going on. Understandably. So I would do it again

281
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,460
if I needed to, but I like to be able to take Sunday night to just like do me and decompress.

282
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,740
Decompression. Yeah. Well, and Rob, I have to, I have to say that when you said sepsis,

283
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,500
I got intensely worried. No, I saw what you got worried, but yeah, I get it. Yeah.

284
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,900
You know, that's what, that's what got Barbara. Yeah. Uh, it's, it's no joke.

285
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:08,860
Right after having started chemo. Yeah. That's why anybody, if, if you've had surgery at any

286
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:15,980
point in the last, I'd say year, two years, and you're feeling like you're, you're starting to

287
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,580
feel feverish, you're feeling really exhausted. You're feeling, um, I'm trying to think of what

288
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:27,260
some of the other ones are, uh, like you don't have an appetite, um, guessing the moment that starts

289
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,140
getting. If you are 84 years old or really at any age, you really should have a working

290
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,300
thermometer at home, which I won't get into. And if showed, if said thermometer shows that

291
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:45,740
your temperature is 102.9 degrees, you probably should go to the ER. I'm not a medical professional

292
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,620
and I'm not here to give advice. However, I can just share my personal experiences with all of

293
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,860
you. Again, the good news is he's fine and he's back to his old stubborn self. So, um, but now,

294
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,820
he gets some free nurse visits to come check up on him, uh, and all that good stuff for a little bit.

295
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,420
So, um, that's also quite welcome right now. So anyway, if you need someone to get fussy,

296
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:14,220
you just tell me, I got it. I'm around enough fussy people in my family. So yes, he's at home.

297
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,220
He's okay. He might even be watching this right now. In which case, sorry, dad, I'm spilling all

298
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,540
your business, but the listeners want to know, and I hope you see all the love for you in the

299
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,700
chat right now. My dad does sometimes lurk in here, just so you know, he's, he's seen the show

300
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,380
and he asks about both of you. Um, so I haven't seen your dad since he drove us to the airport

301
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:39,900
that time to go to packs. Yeah. And, and we took a really crazy long route.

302
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,140
He, he does ask about you cause he'll go, how's your friend that works at place you work and

303
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,700
he'll like, yeah, he'll, he'll always ask me that. So he, he knows who you are for sure.

304
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:58,300
Well, well tell him, tell him I'm doing fine and that I was very, very concerned for him. So yeah.

305
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,580
Yeah. But, but no, I have to say hi to your dad sometime.

306
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,740
Absolutely. I'm sure he'd welcome that. Um, so, uh, anyway, so, so that's what happened last week.

307
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,500
So, you know, I hate to miss two in a row, but, and then here's the real kicker earlier today,

308
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,940
our power went off at noon and I got an automated message from our fiber internet provider that

309
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,140
says your internet is estimated to be down for nine to 10 hours. And I sent a message

310
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,340
via cell phone or I was like, Oh my fucking God, am I going to get screwed again? You've got to

311
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:37,260
be shitting me. Like, what did we say on the last episode to piss off the cosmos? Like my God, but

312
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,100
obviously we're here. Uh, the internet came back when the power did, but that was still a little

313
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:47,180
bit scary for sure. All right. And they, thank you. Thank you for the understanding in chat.

314
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,460
I know this is me when I say, I say, I hate missing two in a row because I know that being

315
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,140
a regular is not a great thing for podcasting and broadcasting all that. But I, so I appreciate all

316
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,180
of you that are still here on the tangent train. Uh, even after two missed episodes,

317
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,140
speaking of missed episodes, we won't be here labor day weekend as is tradition because I'm

318
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:15,420
going back, back, back again to Atlanta to go to dragon con. Um, I, um, I'm going to be hosting

319
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,820
some panels again at dragon con this year. I'm not ready to talk about them tonight because

320
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,940
I'm very superstitious. And, um, I, I, I don't believe anything until I see it printed in the

321
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,420
book or in this case published to the program, but I will say I'm potentially going to have the

322
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,940
biggest panel I've had. Uh, and I will say it's with a voice actor, Loki. I see you nodding cause

323
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,900
I may have spilled the beans before the show. It's, it's a, it's a voice actor. Um, and it

324
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,100
could be the biggest panel I've done and I'm really excited about it. Uh, so not just for that,

325
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:56,460
but just like who it is, uh, is a huge resume. Uh, and I'm just, I'm really stinking excited

326
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,140
about it. So stay tuned for next week. I can't wait to spill the beans on that. Cause I'm hoping

327
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,460
the app was supposed to go live already and technically the app went live, but it went live

328
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,660
with fake data. So when it goes live with real data, I will be happy to share all of the details

329
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,500
on that. So check that out. Um, one other thing I want to say, and then we can get into this week's

330
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,540
gaming news, but this is important too. I just want to take to, uh, take a moment to acknowledge

331
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:28,620
and send thoughts and are just, uh, aching hearts to the people affected by the fires and Maui,

332
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,980
um, over in Lahaina, which is a place I've been to several times. Actually. I went once when I

333
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,340
was younger. Uh, and then I went there on a very important trip when I saw my friend get married

334
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:45,260
out there in 2009. And this was the year before I met Alan and the year after I broke up with my

335
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,780
ex. And so that trip was kind of a trip that I did by myself to go to a wedding. And I actually

336
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,340
drove up to Lahaina and I spent the day there. And I remember shopping there. I ate at the

337
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:01,260
hard rock there, which actually closed down, I think in 2017, but I have, I saw the tree

338
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,780
there that everybody's been talking about this week and so forth. And I have a lot of fond memories

339
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:11,580
of Lahaina. And so to see what has happened there has just, it's absolutely broken my heart. Um,

340
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:18,380
and so it's just, I just want to acknowledge and say my heart and my, I'm so sorry to everybody

341
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,140
that's, that's going through that. It's, it's just, it's awful. It's awful, awful, awful.

342
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,660
I read a very interesting story though, about that, where there was a couple that was like

343
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,740
stuck in the middle of town with fire all around them. Like they, they would have died.

344
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,700
Um, but they had like the, the, the Apple emergency thing that contacted, that does

345
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,940
cellular emergency, not cellular, but, uh, satellite emergency. And they were able to,

346
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,860
through text messages, direct the rescue crew to where they were and got them out of there.

347
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,380
That's really impressive that they were able to get in there through that fire,

348
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,660
because it sounds like that fire was moving fast and it was just so they,

349
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,900
they're very, I'm very happy to hear that they were very lucky, but as we know, there are,

350
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,460
I think 95 people and counting. I don't remember the number because unfortunately it keeps going

351
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,220
up. And that that's the part that's even more painful to hear about, um, that are,

352
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,980
that are going through that. So, um, I, I, one of the tech sites. Yeah. I, I urge you,

353
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,500
if you have, um, the money available, please donate to a, uh, reputable charity.

354
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,220
Please be careful. There are, um, people out there that unfortunately try to profit off of

355
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,700
these types of situations. Please do. I'm not going to tell you who to donate to. There's

356
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,140
many choices out there, but please do just a little bit of research and make sure that

357
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,180
you're donating to a reputable and respectable organization. But there are many out there helping

358
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,980
with the situation that's going on in Maui. Um, the red cross might be a great place to start,

359
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,820
you know, but again, I'm going to leave it up to you and your decision, uh, with that.

360
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,020
But I just want to acknowledge and just, you know, that just, I'm so,

361
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,700
I wanted to take Alan there someday and now, you know, I mean, obviously they will rebuild it,

362
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,780
um, but it won't be, it won't be the same, you know, it's, it's still really sad to hear about

363
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,420
it and it's, it's going to have this history kind of hanging over it, which is really, it's just,

364
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:11,820
which is, is just so sad to think about. So anyway. Yeah. I found, um, a link to it on,

365
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,980
Gizmodo. So awesome. So I put it in the chat for people, um, as to show on how to Matt says my dad

366
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,620
was out there and stayed in that same town last month. Yeah. There's, I mean, there's Lahaina is

367
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,500
one of the big towns there's, um, on the other side of the Island is Hana. And there that's

368
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,980
a very special thing because you got to go, that's the windy roads. It's very famous. So Hana is like

369
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,820
way on the other side of the Island. Kihei is where I stayed when I went. And that's like the

370
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:42,860
other big tourist areas. Kihei. So, um, yeah, but Lahaina is, you know, obviously huge tourist town

371
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,140
is just, yeah. Tragic. Um, as you don't have to Matt says, my dad was out there and stayed in that

372
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,780
same town last month. So sad about what happened there feeling for the locals who had businesses

373
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,420
there for ages. And there was a lot of that. Like I, I talked about the hard rock, but there was a

374
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,500
lot of, you know, family owned, but I went into an independent clothing shop and I will never forget

375
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,900
the story of the rest of my life because the person was so excited to tell me, you know,

376
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,780
Britney Spears was here shopping last week and I had that moment of, Oh,

377
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:20,060
I'm standing on Holy ground right now. So, but, but to think that that shop is like 99%

378
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,140
likely gone at this point, just, it breaks my heart. Cause that was a family and independent,

379
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,900
um, you know, type of place. So anyway, I just wanted to acknowledge that before we got into

380
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,100
the fun video games stuff. Um, and just, you know, I, I don't think we have any listeners impacted

381
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,300
by that, but by golly, if we do, um, my heart goes out to you and your family. And, you know,

382
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,980
I'm sure many, some of you out there probably have family members who were, so just, you know,

383
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,420
our hearts going out to you. Okay. Let's shift gears. We got some gaming news to talk about this

384
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,380
week. Let's start it off a kickoff topic for the first time in a few weeks. Loki what's our big

385
00:32:52,380 --> 00:33:01,500
first story tonight? Uh, it is a remake of wipeout being done by an individual Dominic. Uh, I'm not

386
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:09,740
going to try to butcher this, uh, we'll just go by his name, uh, Phobos lab. And, um, they are,

387
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:16,460
I'm going to guess Zabel Zebelsky, Zebelsky, Dominic Zebelsky. Okay. We're going to go with

388
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,260
that. That's cool. I didn't want to butcher it too many constants in there. Um, anyways,

389
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:30,860
so it is a remake, uh, wipeout, and this was kind of a hobby project being done using the leaked,

390
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:39,420
uh, source code that came out back in 2022. Um, that was from the PlayStation and then, uh,

391
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:47,180
Dean threw all that basically to rewrite the entire thing from scratch. And because apparently

392
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,580
the way they described it, that it was a mess, it was basically a bunch of different versions

393
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:58,220
of the game kind of layered on top of each other. And so they had to completely gut everything and

394
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:04,140
rewrite the engine and all that so that it would work and compile to, you know, modern PCs.

395
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:11,260
And it looks cool and you can play it in your web browser, which is pretty nice. If you go to

396
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:19,100
phoboslab.org slash wipe game, you can play the original wipeout. There's apparently also some

397
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,860
other versions that are being made with the source code as well. Wipeout phantom edition is supposed

398
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:32,060
to take the original game and also add features to it. Whereas this one is mostly just a remake

399
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:38,860
of the original game. Now I find interesting about this kinda that he doesn't seem to give

400
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,540
a shit what Sony thinks about this, which is what I kind of find to be the interesting element,

401
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,460
especially considering as you talked about this, this kind of is born of leaked source code.

402
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:53,660
This seems especially, um, bold we'll say, right. Cause he's, he basically said that there's,

403
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,140
you know, either let it be or shut this thing down and get a real remaster going.

404
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:07,340
This is basically, there's no way to play the original wipeouts on any modern hardware.

405
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:14,620
It's only available. They have the wipeout Omega collection. Um, and you know, I guess you can

406
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,180
emulate old, you know, PlayStation games through like, you know, PlayStation now or something like

407
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,460
that, but there's not, there's no way to play wipeout on any of those apparently. Right. Well,

408
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,740
I guess the Omega collection, you have that, but it's not really the original game, I guess.

409
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,140
I just want to acknowledge real quick, sorry, in chat, they're talking that Omega Loki came out

410
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,780
there for a minute and you'll hear that on the podcast. I switched scenes in OBS. And for some

411
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:44,220
reason, all of my audio settings have reverted across the board. And I have like some looping

412
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,060
audio, which is what you really heard there. If I don't shut it off. So for some reason,

413
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,540
all of those unmuted themselves. So sorry about that. I'm just really a robot. It's fine.

414
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,700
Everything's broken after two weeks of no show. So sorry about if you just heard that on the

415
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,820
podcast feed. It was not you. It's on our end and don't disappear for two weeks because everything

416
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:07,980
breaks when you're gone. Just putting that out there. Yeah. Um, yeah. So basically it's just

417
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,660
kind of not really worried about it because he considers it abandoned where as well,

418
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,900
especially like the PC version of it, you know, that was from like Windows 95 era

419
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,020
and stuff like that. So, um,

420
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,700
you know, yeah. Interesting. Interesting comment from Y Y R who's in our chat. Hello. Hello.

421
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,740
Saying what we need now is wipe out Omega collection for PSVR too. Unfortunately,

422
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,900
that's probably never happening because the dev was shut down. I wonder if that's

423
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,900
potentially what's causing the legal end of this to be a little slow too. I'm not sure.

424
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,780
I mean, I know Sony isn't as litigious as Nintendo, but I still,

425
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:50,460
I still don't believe zero GX or something like that. They'd be like, I know I still,

426
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,500
I still have a hard time believing Sony is going to let this stay up. I just think they move a

427
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,580
little slower. That's all probably. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. I thought I saw

428
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,180
an article somewhere too along these same lines. Cause I want to bring it up that somebody was

429
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,220
trying to recreate PlayStation home and it was a very similar type of thing where they were just

430
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,060
talking about that a while ago. Yeah. They were doing it in the, yeah, that's right.

431
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,660
It did come up in the show and they were doing that kind of in the face of Sony too, where it's

432
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,500
like either, either make a new one or shut this down. You know what? Cowards. Yeah. It's just,

433
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,420
yeah. It's very interesting. Interesting how people want to fight Sony.

434
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,580
I mean what they've done with the Spiderman license and everything. I can see the reasons

435
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:36,300
behind wanting to take up arms against them. Wipe out such a fun game though. I'm glad,

436
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,860
I'm glad it's. Make a new wipe out. I mean, come on, what's stopping you?

437
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:47,980
I'd love that. I, there is one of the wipe out games is in the PlayStation plus library.

438
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,460
I'm pretty sure. I don't think it's the original original is one of the other ones is maybe the

439
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,100
one they did on PSP. I can't remember, but I feel like one of them is available there. So.

440
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,820
Yeah. So they described it like the source of the leak or whatever they said the quality of

441
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,220
the leak source is abysmal. It says it contains the Wipeout ATI 3D Rage Edition.

442
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:15,980
And it was, I guess, something that they said they bundled with ATI GPUs and had versions of

443
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,740
the game or parts of the game from like Wipeout PlayStation and the Windows 95 version, also a

444
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:27,660
Wipeout 98 directory. That was the one that they compiled in the ATI Rage Edition. They're saying

445
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:33,180
there's some other stuff talking about how the game had been modified to work with the PAL

446
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,140
versions, you know, changing the physics calculations for, you know, PAL regions. So

447
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:46,540
25 FPS instead of locked to 30. Yeah, it's an interesting story. If you go to Phoboslab.org,

448
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,180
though, they have a whole blog post talking about the entire rewrite and all the like

449
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:58,220
stuff that they had to do. And many, many times mentioning how awful the code was,

450
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:04,460
which I think is pretty funny. Some comments in chat, Tiger Claw is saying a new Wipeout in 4K

451
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,460
should be the ultimate version that has all tracks from the previous games. And it needs a kick ass

452
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,820
techno soundtrack. Well, of course, you need to kick ass techno soundtrack. Yeah, you don't have

453
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,460
a futuristic race. I would just buy it for the soundtrack. But the compilation that was kind of

454
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,540
the Omega collection was kind of that. So really just do it. upscale the Omega collection. Like

455
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,420
just I'm just thinking like how good that would be now with a PlayStation five and stuff like that.

456
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:34,060
You could totally do it for exactly I mean, like you could push it that much more and it would

457
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:40,460
just be so amazing. And then put it in VR and it would be just do it. I mean, come on. Well, and

458
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,500
then you know, and then since you're Sony, you can just spin it off into a movie and people would

459
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,780
watch that too. I mean, Gran Turismo gets a movie. Why we are in chat says I do have to say Wipeout

460
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:56,140
Omega collection on PS VR one is probably the most intense thing I've ever experienced in VR

461
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,220
so much so that I could only handle one race. I had to take the goggles off, catch my breath

462
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,860
and balance then quit. It was nuts. I don't think I got around to playing that in VR. But I know

463
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,700
because they went back and patched it in at some point, but I can imagine it's a pretty intense

464
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:15,820
experience and how fast that game moves. So neat. All right. Let's move on and talk about the types

465
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,340
of games that we've been playing this week. I'd be curious if anyone's been playing Wipeout.

466
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Let's do how was your gaming week and go around and see what folks have been playing. Dark Sakura,

467
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,900
how about you? How was your gaming week? I played of course Dead by Daylight with

468
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:42,220
Shayla here, of course, who is the killer whisperer, I guess. I have played Live Alive.

469
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:50,220
I finished the mecha character. I finished that story yesterday. I kept wanting to sing

470
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,900
along with the giant robot music. It was fantastic. I've only got, I think, three scenarios

471
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:04,540
left to do before doing the big end game scenario. What else? Oh, yeah. I started Disney

472
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,500
Dreamlight Valley. I will be playing it again tomorrow night after ballet because it's chill

473
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,940
vibes. It makes me happy. I saw you playing that a little bit. Although I'm annoyed at the fishing

474
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,460
part. It's like, why does Mickey have to come watch me fish? Piss off, Merlin. I always want to fish

475
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:29,820
by myself. Like when, wow, when I fish and no one bugged me. But anyway. Oh, you're very welcome,

476
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,940
Jim Sally. Jim Sally has been a regular visitor in my channel and I've been super happy.

477
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,660
I was lurking a little bit this week and I saw Jim Sally in there and I wanted to go say hi,

478
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,700
but I was on, I didn't have my keyboard. So it was on the TV.

479
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,940
Yeah. Okay. I actually have like a small TV keyboard, like a Bluetooth keyboard that I

480
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,740
could give you. Uh, maybe we'll see. Yeah. Cause I can always hook that up to Xbox. Yeah.

481
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:00,940
I can find it. Um, so I also, uh, played, uh, what else? Video game did I play?

482
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,460
I was going to say quickly on the farming thing. I'm sorry. I just want to point this out. And I'm

483
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,100
curious if this has ended up on your radar, but this, this game just exploded on Twitch

484
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,700
this week. I feel like, or maybe in the last two weeks, because it, yes. You knew where I was

485
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:19,820
going. Polia. What, what, what's your take on that? Well, I can't play it until, well, unless

486
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,780
there's an app, a Mac version I have to find out. Um, and I got a link from a friend to,

487
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,460
to join in on the beta there. Um, but I watched, uh, my friend, uh, Raven McPherson play it last

488
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:35,820
night and it is pretty chill vibes. I was, I was pretty down for it and I think, uh,

489
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,460
I would enjoy it. Um, although I'm still waiting for the Activision sale to finish. So that

490
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:49,020
dude is gone and I can play well again. Um, but, Oh yeah. I remember what else I played last night.

491
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,060
Um, uh, last week I played over the past two weeks. Sorry. I played a GQ. Oh, she buried

492
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:01,100
Parodius for a super Famicom. And I played some of gone. I played some final fight guy.

493
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:10,140
Um, play a little bit of F zero. Um, I played a little bit of, uh, Rondo of blood for PC engine.

494
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:17,660
Um, I played some Saturn stuff because I was testing out my Saturn thing. Um, radiant silver

495
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:25,100
gun. Um, and, uh, what was the other Saturday, Saturday when I was playing, uh, gun bird,

496
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:34,860
a little bit of gun bird. So that was, that, that, that was it. Oh, and I do now have my, um, copy

497
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,380
of robot Monday. And I'm going to be playing this shit out of that. Oh yeah. I also played

498
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:48,380
Strider too. That's a lot of game, but there's the cherry on top, the cherry, you know what the

499
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:57,980
cherry is. I hinted at it earlier. We have weird Al in my house. We have weird Al's museum of modern

500
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:04,300
hilarity. And my first game of it, I get over 3 million and it doesn't put me on the board.

501
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,100
I beat Dan. And then since then I haven't been able to top 1 million. It's like, what is it game?

502
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,540
Why are you mean to me? But it's tons and tons and tons. I have beginner's luck on tables,

503
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,380
like where I have a really good run the first, just ask Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, on the tables

504
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,780
in his basement. I had such a, and I can, I can't duplicate it after that first run. It's wild.

505
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,580
It's it's crazy though. Cause the, the table, cause it's one of those P three tables, which

506
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:36,460
are the modular ones. It's tall. Like I have to get, you know, those aerobic steps that you do,

507
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:41,180
like step up and they're stackable. I have one of those now so that I am the right height to

508
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:51,740
play weird Al. It is that much taller than me and well, taller than my capacity to play it.

509
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:59,740
And it's just, I mean, but it's so much fun and there's so many little things in there

510
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,140
and I'm learning new things in the game. And I found the supply closet and, and

511
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:12,300
Harvey, the wonder hamster is my nemesis. Cause like I always play worse when I'm trying to hit

512
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:20,940
the target for Harvey and yeah. All right. It's great. All right. Well, let's move on

513
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:25,740
for Loki and his gaming week. It's been mostly editing,

514
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,500
actually editing video, but Minecraft. Yeah. We did the world tour today. And of course,

515
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:40,380
lots of editing still. And I did play one other game though, because we were doing kind of just

516
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:48,540
in our discord and stuff hanging out. And so we popped in a Jack box and I played a little bit of

517
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:57,100
trivia murder party too. I almost won. I was this close, this close, but that was fun. And also I

518
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,860
was spectating the t-shirt dojo one or something like that. I don't remember what it's called,

519
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,060
but I think there's a new Jack box game coming out pretty soon here. So

520
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,940
cranking out one of those every year, but for good reason, they're always a lot of fun. They're very

521
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:17,420
successful party games. So yeah, they're very fun. Okay. My gaming week. So I pretty much talked

522
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,020
already about Southern fried gaming expo, which is, I played a variety of games. They're really

523
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,180
too many for me to go back in name, but what I can't, I will say though, since I see you all

524
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,420
talking about the money games and music games and chat, I did leave this part out on accident,

525
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,420
but there was the whole back of the room was lined up with music machines and they were busy

526
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,660
all the time. Like I, I didn't really want to like wait around a long time. And I was like,

527
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,980
Oh, I'll get on there when nobody's on it at California extreme. That's how it is at

528
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:49,900
California. Oh yeah. Oh, I'm sure busy the entire time. And I, I didn't really want to

529
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,540
embarrass myself with my skill on those anyway, but it was fun, but they didn't have a 2DX machine.

530
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,260
Unfortunately, that was the one I would have played if they had, but they had like pop them

531
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,660
because they had all the others. They had the one that looks like keyboard mania, the newer one.

532
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,540
And I was like, Ooh, I want to play that, but it was, it was crowded the entire time.

533
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:12,300
Um, so yeah, they, you know, good times, but, um, after Southern fried,

534
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,900
I stayed one more night at black Wolf Manor because, um, I was flying home the next day

535
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,780
and thank you in nostalgia. That was the game. Thanks. Start to Tia. That was, that was the game.

536
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,180
Um, because I was flying home the next day, I was staying the night at black Wolf Manor and

537
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:33,340
he has PlayStation VR too, which we've talked a lot about on this show, but I have yet to try it.

538
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:40,220
So he actually had me try it out. And I actually, uh, I played a little bit of the horizon, uh,

539
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:46,140
game that's on the PSVR and he first put it into a mode that was very interesting. It was like an

540
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,020
on rails kind of mode where it was really just an experience. It honest to God felt like I was on

541
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,780
jungle cruise without the puns. Um, well, that's the best part. That is the best part, but this,

542
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,980
you know, this had a jump scare at the end and all this stuff. And it was,

543
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,620
it was neat. Um, you know, just like how well it responded to you and some of like the haptic,

544
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:11,660
you know, stuff that was going on. It was, um, it was cool. Like I, I get why, you know, it's,

545
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:18,060
it's a better piece of technology than the first VR. I just wish the must have game was on there.

546
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,380
Cause I did, I did futs around with like, there's like a special gaming mode and it was kind of

547
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,460
interesting. Like you'd have to do the whole, like reaching behind you to grab an arrow and

548
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,300
like shoot an arrow like that. And it was, it was kind of neat. Like I actually got kind of

549
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,940
a workout playing it, but like, you know, again, it kind of suffered from that Nintendo Wii mini

550
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:42,460
game collection syndrome, um, type of thing. And I understand I was only seeing certain modes or

551
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,460
whatever, but I still, I still don't see myself paying the amount of money that it takes to get

552
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:56,780
PlayStation VR two and this just to have this game. I, I don't really see that happening. Um,

553
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,220
and again, you know, a lot of the things that are on the PlayStation VR two, uh, are kind of a lot

554
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:08,540
of rehashes of what was on VR one. So I, again, I'm not sure that, yeah. And Bobby even agrees

555
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,220
with me that the software isn't there to justify it yet. And that's the thing I worry about for

556
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:19,340
the PlayStation VR two, but I will say the tech is great. So I hope, you know, I hope maybe next

557
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,140
year they can get some big titles to really justify the purchase of the VR two. Cause I'd

558
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:32,060
love to get one. What I loved most about it in this mode I was playing. I did not have to stand

559
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:38,220
up and move around. It lets you play just sitting there on the couch or in, you know, black Wolf

560
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:45,660
Manor. It's like, you know, movie sofa type of things. Um, I could sit on that and play the game

561
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:51,660
and have a good experience without the massive amounts of movement that older VR kind of usually

562
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:57,980
goes for. And I think that's a good thing for VR as well is that sometimes you just, sometimes you

563
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:04,380
just want to VR and chill, meaning sit down and play. And yeah, everything I did in the, um,

564
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:10,460
horizon game that I played was sitting down. Um, yeah, black will says they prefer you to stand

565
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,460
up and play, but they give a seated option. Good. Cause I liked the seated option and I don't feel

566
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,020
like it took anything away from the experience to be honest. So that was that. Oh yeah. Bobby

567
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:24,620
brings up the eye tracking that that feature was a little weird to me, but it didn't do anything

568
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:31,020
where I was like, this is too weird for me. Like it was just, it was interesting to like,

569
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,660
look at things and have it like highlight that because you're looking at it with your eyes.

570
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:41,740
That was just very interesting. So, uh, yeah, that was my quick experience with the PlayStation VR

571
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,100
too. Uh, Y Y R says PS VR two is the new Vita. I was hoping it wouldn't be, but it's clear to me

572
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,660
now that Sony decided to pre-launch to basically not support it, to leave it to third parties and

573
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:57,340
then forget about it. Sadly, I worry you are probably right on that, but I would, Hey, Sony

574
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:05,500
proved me wrong. I dare you. Let's all call Sony out this week. Shut this down, support your system.

575
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:11,660
All right. Anyway. Um, and then I've been playing of course, lots of Diablo four. Cause I feel like

576
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,740
I'm the only person I know that still plays that game, but I'm enjoying season one. Uh, and it's

577
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:21,980
great to just do some mindless clicking, uh, in that game and enjoy that. And a little bit of final

578
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:28,300
fantasy 14, the only new game I played this week, which actually it's been out a little bit, but I

579
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:37,020
finally got around to playing tunic. And I did a stream even on, um, Wednesday, Tuesday. I don't

580
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:42,380
remember, but I played tunic. Uh, and that game is very interesting. I get the comparisons to the old

581
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:48,460
school legend of Zelda. It's very that, and very like how you find items to allow you to access

582
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:53,100
new parts of the map, like that very type of traditional setup where it sort of turns the

583
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:59,820
formula on its head that I think is very clever is the whole collecting pieces of the instruction

584
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:05,260
manual. So when you're out in the wild, you will see these sparkling cards. And when you pick it

585
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:09,740
up, you realize, Oh, this is a missing page from the instruction manual, but the instruction manual

586
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:15,740
might actually unveil something where it's like, Oh, if I knew this the whole time, this would have

587
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,980
been easier, or I could have gotten through this part because it was in the instruction manual.

588
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,420
And it tells you how to do certain things in the game visually that because the end game stuff is

589
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:30,940
all in a made up symbol language that, you know, you can't understand, but that's by design so

590
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,340
that the manual helps explain those things to you. So you know how to unlock it. So I thought

591
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:40,300
that was a very clever twist. And I thought the map design is really clever too, because again,

592
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,380
you'll go all the way through this area and find, Oh, finally, I was able to access this area and

593
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,260
go around and then you'll find there was a secret passage the entire time from the area you could

594
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:54,860
already access. So this game is almost certainly a speedrunner's dream. Because once you learn about

595
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:00,620
all those things, I'm sure you can be I'm sure you can bang this game out in minutes, if not a

596
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:06,220
couple hours. So yeah, I'm excited to explore that game a little more. It was it was a fun experience.

597
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:13,820
And again, it's it's a familiar formula, but really, really flipped up on its head a little

598
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:21,020
bit. So I thought that was really fun. SSJ100Matt says Mike Deft wore everyone down and for those

599
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:26,620
who don't get the joke, Deft has been saying for a long time now we need to play tunic. I mean,

600
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,860
it helped you know, you always want to get the vouch from your friends that a game is

601
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:37,580
particularly good. Oh, wow. Bobby says the speedrun world record is 17 minutes,

602
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:43,020
25 seconds. I'm kind of not surprised to hear that. There's got to be a secret passage system

603
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:49,900
that takes you right to the last boss or something. It's wild. But um, yeah, I genuinely

604
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,540
enjoy tuning. I mean, it was on my radar just from the preview trailers. But you know, there's

605
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,660
lots of games I'd like to play. And I always get sucked into the same old ones Diablo dead by

606
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:04,620
daylight, Final Fantasy 14, you name it. I tend to stick to the same ones, but I'm glad I branched

607
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:13,580
out and made myself play tunic and I will do it again. In this coming week or so forth. YYR says

608
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:19,340
that's faster than the original Legend of Zelda Oh, interesting. Wow. I guess it's not surprising.

609
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,980
All right, that was my gaming week. Let's get into some other news that has happened this week.

610
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,300
So we'll go around and start with Loki. Apparently there's rumors. I mean,

611
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,580
there's always rumors that they're going to do a PlayStation slim of some sort. But

612
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:45,660
now there's rumors and a video allegedly showing what appears to be a slimmer PlayStation five case.

613
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:55,340
Okay, we'll see if it comes out. I don't believe anything I see in the internet nowadays.

614
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:59,820
So it would be I don't know, it would be interesting if they get that out in time for the

615
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:06,460
holidays. Yeah, that's what the timing is on that, especially when, you know, something not on our

616
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:12,380
list tonight, but was definitely in the news while we were gone was this whole, you know, did Final

617
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:19,260
Fantasy 16 sell enough copies or not. And I feel like there's a lot that analysts and internet

618
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:25,580
critics are kind of reading into it a little bit. But even square has commented that, you know,

619
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:30,780
essentially being exclusive on one platform has held the sales back, which I think have a lot of

620
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,780
people going. This is why you should release on PC is that you're you only get congrats you played

621
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:42,620
yourself. You made that deal with Sony you made the bed lie in it. But I don't know at the same

622
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,940
time. I don't think it means that the game is not successful. But yeah, this is the same company

623
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,580
that you know, was disappointed in the sales of Tomb Raider when it sold like 3 million copies.

624
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,060
Oh, it failed. How much of that is actual disappointment? And how much of that are

625
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,380
internet people blowing things up out of proportion for clickbait headlines, especially now

626
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,460
that one of the most major social media websites out there literally pays you to make shit up to

627
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:10,780
get more impressions. Which is why everyone should be reducing their presence on their site. But I

628
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:17,020
digress. I'll take my soapbox and go home. Um, but here's, here's, here's the thing is that the

629
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,100
reason what they were blaming for all that was that there was not enough PlayStation fives out

630
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,660
there because we all know for years, they struggled to have enough play. It's only really

631
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:30,300
this year that you can finally walk into Target and buy a PlayStation five. It took them a long

632
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:36,460
time to get there. And so there is kind of that being pointed at as a problem for why Final Fantasy

633
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:41,020
16 and sells many copies. So it is interesting. Now we're talking about a slim because maybe this

634
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:47,260
is to try to push even more out there even at a lower price to move more exclusive games.

635
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,180
I gotta be honest. So looking at that, like,

636
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:57,020
I can't see that. I mean, I guess it's slimmer. It still looks really ugly. And it's not that

637
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:04,140
much. It's still pretty big. Like, no, I don't want it.

638
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:10,460
Breakman in chat says it seems a bit late in the year to announce new hardware,

639
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:15,180
even if it's just a remodel. Breakman, it does feel that way. So I acknowledge that it does

640
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,460
feel that way because the death of E3 has changed everything. And there's a couple other things that

641
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:26,540
play into this as well. But remember, you used to hear about these things in June. E3 is dead.

642
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:35,260
E3 is dead. She gone, girl. It's dead. It's not coming back. So well, if in the form you will,

643
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:39,260
because it already was not in the form that you remember from the past. But I don't want to have

644
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,980
to eat my words with catch up later on because they will take that branding and slap it on

645
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:49,820
something else. Just you wait. But the E3 you remember is dead. Okay. So that whole sense of

646
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:56,060
announcing things in June for the holiday season that died with E3. Yes, there is Summer Game Fest,

647
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,620
and there are still some announcements, but then other things have changed the game too.

648
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:05,580
Nintendo Switch being one of them. Don't forget how much lead time did we have on the Nintendo

649
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:10,700
Switch? We had years of rumors, but when they finally did announce the Nintendo Switch,

650
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:18,620
we had two months. Two months of warning. So they announced that in January for a March release.

651
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:23,500
So the games changed when it comes to these timetables. And as was said by somebody else

652
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,620
later in chat, YYR says, well, what if they announced it in September for the holiday season?

653
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:36,140
They sure could. They could do it. It's still like, I just don't see the point,

654
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,460
like, unless it's going to be cheaper or something, which I don't think it would be. It's just, you

655
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:46,860
know, smaller, slightly. Yeah. I mean, cool. I mean, if it means there's more consoles out there,

656
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:52,620
nice. I don't think it's a shortage right now, but yeah, I don't know.

657
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:57,260
Orange right in chat says, I was about to say the Switch didn't need an E3 reveal. Good point. Well,

658
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,740
don't forget Nintendo was the first one to put the knife into E3 when they took their directs

659
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,540
online. I mean, whether you want to be that dramatic in your phrasing or not, that was the

660
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:11,740
first piece of the wall to crumble. And you couple that with the embarrassment that Sony made out of

661
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:18,540
themselves with the unveiling of the PlayStation 3. Microsoft did it too, but they didn't do that

662
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:23,980
at E3. That was their own conference. They did it at. I like that recently that video came out

663
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:29,260
remastered in 1080p so that you can watch it in higher definition. I thought that was great.

664
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,220
Breakman in chat says, so what I'm hearing from Sky is that I am old. Hey,

665
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:40,860
you and me both, bro. You and me both. If I'm going to get reminded about my age by you all,

666
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:46,860
I'm dragging you all with me every week. Quest Buster with a very marginalized approach on this

667
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:53,020
that kind of finds the good balance between both saying Gamescom is also coming up. Fair point.

668
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,820
Sony could unveil it at Gamescom. They could. I don't know how much stock I'd put in that,

669
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,700
but they could. They could have that out on the show floor as their way to kind of debut it.

670
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:08,780
I don't think that it's not. Oh, your favorite. It's plausible Quest Buster. That is a plausible

671
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,020
answer that that could happen. I'll use your favorite word. You meaning the listeners.

672
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:19,500
All right, but we'll see. Have we heard if this is completely a diskless thing? I thought I saw

673
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,340
that as well. It looks like it's got a disk on it. That's the thing. That's what I don't understand.

674
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:33,100
I mean, I get it. I don't know. I was really bent out of shape about not having a disk drive

675
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:38,060
originally, but then I look at what I buy my games on now. It's all digital, so it's fine.

676
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:45,100
I think that's more OK on PC. I don't trust it as much on consoles because, you know,

677
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,580
you have it where it's like, oh, you can't transfer your games over to the new console

678
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:54,460
all the time, which makes sense to some degree. But it does suck, especially when you have like

679
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:59,500
a library of several hundred games or, you know, something like that. It's like, am I expected

680
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:05,820
just to keep this old console around? I guess. But, yeah, I would think if they're trying to

681
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:13,020
get it as small of a form factor as possible, as cheap of a price, you would think that they

682
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:18,940
would want to do like a slim driveless model. But nope. Allegedly, I mean, at least this

683
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,180
video is of a thing with a disk drive, which looks stupid. Like, I don't like how it's got

684
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:30,700
this like bulge out the side. It's pregnant with a disk drive. It's just really stupid looking.

685
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,220
But I mean, the original system was like that, too. It's just.

686
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:39,660
All right. I don't know. Make it boxy. It's fine. Doesn't have to be sexy, smooth

687
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:45,740
in in like curvy and stuff, because that doesn't work if I'm putting in an entertainment center,

688
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:50,060
like it needs to be boxy so I can stack things on top of it or just.

689
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,900
Real systems have curves, Loki.

690
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:59,180
PCs don't have curves. PCs are boxes for the most part. So come on.

691
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,900
Anyway. All right. Let's move on and talk about speaking of PC and consoles and other places.

692
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:12,300
One of the big game developers, Devolver Digital, had a conference this week,

693
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,380
but this was interesting. They called it the Devolver Delayed Showcase.

694
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:23,980
Because all they announced in this was that Angerfoot, Pepper Grinder,

695
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:31,660
the Plucky Squire, Stick It to the Stick Man and Skate Story have all moved to 2024.

696
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:36,860
So it was a three minute video called Devolver Delayed where they just made the announcements.

697
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:40,460
All of these games have shifted to 2024. Please look forward to it.

698
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,740
And that kind of cracked me up a little bit, to be honest. I will say that Plucky Squire is the

699
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:50,060
one that sticks out to me from that bunch. If I remember, that's the one that looks like the

700
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:54,700
storybook. It's a very interesting kind of looking little game. That's one of those games that I

701
01:02:54,700 --> 01:03:00,140
won't play for two years until Mike Deft is like screaming at me every week to go play it. Go play

702
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:05,180
the Plucky Squire and then I'll do a stream of it. But that game does look interesting. And at

703
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:12,300
least I have another year before it's out because it got delayed until 2024. All right. Moving on.

704
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:22,700
Dark Sakura. Well, we've known for a while that there's been a lot of control by the Chinese

705
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:29,180
government to try to limit how people play games and what kinds of games they play and how often

706
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:38,060
they play it. And so there was actually results of their policy of implementing the curfew for

707
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:42,940
the individuals under the age of 18. It said it had no impact on heavy gaming habits.

708
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:51,980
They basically, the time limit was enacted in November 2019 with a restriction of 90 minutes

709
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:58,300
per day or three hours on public holidays. And then they were limited further August 2021,

710
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:03,900
limiting playtime to one hour on specific days, namely Fridays, weekends and holidays.

711
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:11,420
It was trying to combat gaming addiction. And other governments have been paying attention

712
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:18,700
to it, watching it as studies. So there was a team of researchers that was led by David Zendal at the

713
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:24,780
University of York. They analyzed over 7 billion hours of gameplay over an 11 week period starting

714
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:31,260
from November 2019. They focused on 118 million unique gamer profiles in China linked to Unity.

715
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:40,300
And the analysis showed that it really had no effect. In fact, they were 1.14 times more

716
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:45,900
likely to engage in heavy gaming, playing for over four hours a day, six days a week after the policy

717
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:53,740
was implemented. They noticed that, I mean, the increase isn't like that, you know, meaningful

718
01:04:53,740 --> 01:05:06,620
really. But yeah. This is what happens when you try to force something on people, they're still

719
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:12,860
going to find a way to do something. And really, it begins with, you know, maybe not having a

720
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:18,780
really bad totalitarian style government, I guess. Well, I was going to read this comment from

721
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,620
Brakeman in our chat that says, you know what the most effective thing against children gaming too

722
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:35,340
much? Their parents. Well, even so, I would say, like, I'm going to use myself as an example.

723
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:44,620
If I'm in a situation that I'm unhappy, I'm going to look for distraction more readily. If I'm happy

724
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:50,940
and having meaningful things going on in my life, I will probably be out doing said meaningful

725
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:55,420
things. I mean, I'm not saying that gaming doesn't have any meaning or anything like that,

726
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:01,900
but I'm saying that there's clearly something else going on that makes the games a little

727
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:06,300
bit more addictive, that makes them more attractive than other things in their life.

728
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:15,100
So I would say, you know, you can't put everything 100% on a parent if you have a

729
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:21,260
willful child. I say this as a former willful child. I would agree with that. I was very good

730
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:25,660
at hiding how many video games I was playing for my parents, especially once the Game Boy came out.

731
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,180
Your parents cannot stop that without taking the whole thing away,

732
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:37,580
which is always going to start a fight. So at any rate, what they need to do

733
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:45,180
is go back and look at the base problem. It's like in technical troubleshooting,

734
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:50,300
you have to find the root cause. And what is the root cause of gaming addiction? Well,

735
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:56,940
it's not just the game. I mean, yeah, the game's a big part of it, but there's also something that

736
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:05,900
leads someone to do nothing but to get that dopamine release, I guess, when they're playing

737
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:12,380
a game and they hit that reward, you know, why aren't they getting that from other things?

738
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:17,580
What makes the difference here or there? And I think it's really a matter of looking at

739
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:26,540
this from a psychological point of view, a cultural point of view, a societal point of view,

740
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:31,260
rather than just say, oh, just restrict them. That'll do it. No, it won't. An addict will find

741
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,180
a way to feed their addiction. All right.

742
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:40,940
Well, let's move on to another story. It looks like someone hit pause on your avatar. I don't

743
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:50,860
know if the program just. But anyway, Loki, OK. You know, it's funny to see Roblox out

744
01:07:50,860 --> 01:08:00,540
metaverse in the metaverse, but, you know, we have a story about Roblox allowing folks to actually

745
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:09,980
apply and kind of interview for jobs in Roblox. So Roblox Corporation themselves are actually

746
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:18,380
having areas in their own platform where you can actually get an idea of what it would be like to

747
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:24,300
have a career at Roblox. They have an innovation center where candidates can come in and see what

748
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:29,020
they have planned. They have a podcast lounge we could listen to. Apparently they have a podcast. I

749
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:37,500
mean, everybody has a podcast, I guess, by their CEO. And they have a library with curated selection

750
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:43,420
of books and other reading materials. People who are really going to read books in Roblox,

751
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:50,220
I just don't see that happening. But yeah, they said the Roblox, the Career Center will let the

752
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:56,220
company reach early career candidates across the world. How early are we talking here, children?

753
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:02,860
Um, wait, I don't know. Can we play orange on radio in Roblox? Why aren't we jumping if we if

754
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:09,580
you could do podcasts in Roblox? Where's the OLR? You probably could I think maybe we can make home

755
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:17,500
my son's at the same time. Kids shouldn't listen to this show. So if Roblox is mostly kids, then

756
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:23,820
maybe it's well, that's where that's where the mature rated content in Roblox, which is a recent

757
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:31,740
edition comes into play. So technically, it is Roblox material at this point. Gotcha. But yeah,

758
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:36,060
my son's actually doing Roblox programming now, because he's gotten to that level in his

759
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:43,740
programming class to where he is doing Lua. So it's strictly for Roblox stuff. But yeah,

760
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,780
there's a place you should put PlayStation home in Roblox. There you go.

761
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,940
All right, I have to giggle a little bit, too, because I think I think dark soccer stepped away

762
01:09:52,940 --> 01:10:00,060
for a minute. But her avatar looks like like it frozen is really funny. But I guess when it

763
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:04,220
stopped, like camera tracking, as she was getting up and leaving, it just looks like it looks like

764
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:10,460
she's tilted her head back and passed out in her chair. Like Loki's Loki's Roblox story was so

765
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:17,420
fucking boring. It put the vtubers to sleep. I mean, it isn't exactly super interesting.

766
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:31,260
I don't know why the image is so funny to me. All right. Anyhow, let's talk about other things that

767
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:39,260
have been around a while. Let's talk about Pokemon presents. So Pokemon had a very special recap or

768
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:44,060
direct whatever you want to call it this week. It was the Pokemon presents August 2023 showcase

769
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:51,100
where they had 35 minutes of updates on different projects, including DLC for Scarlet and Violet,

770
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:58,620
the hidden treasure of areas, area zero, area zero. Also, there was an update on the Pokemon

771
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:04,460
World Championships, which I think was going on this weekend in Yokohama, which means competitions

772
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:10,940
for Scarlet Violet, the trading card game Unite Go even has a competition there because Pokemon Go

773
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:14,620
has a whole tie-in thing going on right now in that game. So they were talking a little bit

774
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:21,260
about that. They were talking about an animated mini web series called Pokemon Path to the Peak.

775
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:26,940
This is about the trading card game. And in this little cartoon, we got to meet the protagonist and

776
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:33,100
you know, the oddish partner Pokemon. It will be on YouTube now. Actually, it came out on the 11th

777
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:38,940
of August. So it's available now. Then we got into some of the good stuff for gaming. A new trailer

778
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:44,700
for Detective Pikachu Returns. Sorry, Danny DeVito is still not the voice of Detective

779
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:49,580
Pikachu, but the game does look fun for those that are curious about that. There was also a teaser

780
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:59,580
for Pokemon Horizons, the series. This is the show post Ash Ketchum and all that. The kickoff date

781
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:05,820
will be September 8th in North America is when that series will be launching for us here. They

782
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:12,380
did some updates for Pokemon Go. They were begging people to buy tickets for Pokemon Go Fest Global

783
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:17,260
on the 26th and 27th of August, even if you're not going to the New York City one in person.

784
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:23,180
They also are saying that DNC, I don't know how to say this Pokemon's name, sorry,

785
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:29,100
is making the Pokemon Go debut and it will have a mega evolution as well. And Mega Rayquaza is also

786
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:36,620
coming to the game. Whoopee! But the big announcement for Pokemon Go, the new Pokemon from

787
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:43,340
Gen 9, starter Pokemon, will be making their Go debut in September. What's kind of interesting

788
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:52,300
about this news is that Gen 8's not finished. It's far from finished. The starters for Gen 8

789
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:56,300
are not in the game. They're going to put the starters for Gen 9 in the game before they do

790
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:00,780
the starters for Gen 8, which I think is interesting. I don't know. Just to be different.

791
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,740
They have some, like Wooloo is in the game of some other Gen 8 Pokemon, but they, for whatever

792
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:10,540
reason, are skipping it otherwise. I don't know if this is just Go being different. It probably,

793
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:16,700
honestly, it's probably just to tie into the fact that there is Scarlet and Violet DLC coming out.

794
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:21,980
And so they want to do a tie into that and push those games back to the front with the holiday

795
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:27,100
season around the corner. There's a lot of people that, you know, Pokemon Go is their primary

796
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:35,020
Pokemon game. So I think it has to do more with all that than everything else. Pokemon Unite is

797
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:41,340
getting a new game mode called Panic Parade. With this mode, you work with your teammates to protect

798
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:47,820
a certain Pokemon from oncoming enemies. Also, Mewtwo License X is now in the game and Mewtwo

799
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:54,380
License X can evolve into Mega Mewtwo X. And then guess what's coming on 17th of August? Mewtwo

800
01:13:54,380 --> 01:14:02,780
License Y, of course. And then in Pokemon Master Sex, which actually the game is called Pokemon

801
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:09,420
Masters EX, but it's impossible to read this and not see Pokemon Master Sex. I mean it. That's

802
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:14,300
just the order of the letters. Yeah. Pokemon Master Sex will be seeing

803
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:20,380
Nimona from Scarlet and Violet and Pomat are coming to the game. It is a new sync pair in

804
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:27,820
the game with the sprint roll that allows them to attack quickly. A Pokemon Cafe remix game is

805
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:34,380
coming up. And I think probably the news that had a lot of people excited was Pokemon Trading Card

806
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:41,020
Game and Pokemon Stadium 2 were released on Nintendo Switch Online. Why they won't just put

807
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:47,660
out the classic Pokemon games is anyone's guess. My guess is they want to sell it separately someday.

808
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:52,460
But still, the Pokemon Trading Card Game was pretty good as was Stadium 2. A lot of people

809
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:56,300
do like those games. So you can check those out with the NSO. Of course, you'll need the

810
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:04,300
expansion pack for Pokemon Stadium 2, but that is something that will be coming soon. And then last,

811
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:09,020
we'll mention the Mewtwo Terra Raid battle in Scarlet and Violet. That is going to be happening

812
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:15,100
from September 1st through September 17th. And then they showed a little bit of a deep dive on

813
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:22,140
the DLC that's also coming out with the hidden treasures of area zero, which feature the teal

814
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:29,900
mask and the indigo disc. That's part one and part two. It's one DLC in two parts. So there you go.

815
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:36,140
Lots of Pokemon news, although most people saying the presents overall was kind of lackluster.

816
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,900
My guess is it's because the focus was a little less on the games and there was a lot of stuff

817
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,620
on the anime. I think a lot of Pokemon fans don't care for GO, quite frankly.

818
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:56,060
There's a lot of stuff that doesn't really relate to the games. I think people set the bar too high

819
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:59,820
in expecting that they were going to announce a remake or something. It's not time for that yet.

820
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:04,860
You got to wait for next year for news on whatever they're going to do. If they're remaking Gen 5 or

821
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,020
whatever they're doing, there's a lot of rumors going around with that. One rumor was that instead

822
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:15,020
of doing a remake of Gen 5, they're going to do like a basically a sequel, which is funny because

823
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,260
there already is a black to white too. So I don't know, but this is something I guess they're

824
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:23,580
looking at maybe black three. I don't know something that may be like a spiritual successor

825
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:29,340
or something. Who knows? So Mike Defton chat says for me, it was fine. I really didn't expect

826
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:35,660
anything really mind blowing. Tigerclaw in chat says, good thing they separated the EX from

827
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:42,060
Pokemon masters EX. That little space bar is not going to stop the internet from saying Pokemon

828
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:48,220
master sex. Once it's there, it's there. It's once on the internet, always on the internet.

829
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:53,260
All right. Speaking of things that are now always on the internet, Dark Sakura.

830
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:59,100
Hey, I'm not always on the internet. Not always, but even when you step

831
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,660
away from your keyboard, your avatar is still here on the internet.

832
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,580
Apparently she does very wonky things when I'm not here.

833
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:12,220
Yeah. I know about that. I know about that. It's just, uh, the cousins came over and there's a

834
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:16,700
spaghetti with the spasm meatball. Oh no, you don't, you don't have to explain it. It's just

835
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,060
funny that when you stepped away, your Pokemon was like, or your Pokemon.

836
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:35,180
I know Jamie Mon go, use pester ball. It's super effective.com. Anyway. So, um, there is a comic

837
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,500
series that I was actually super excited about when it came out and that was, uh, Teenage Mutant

838
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:48,220
Ninja Turtles, The Last Ronin. And it was pretty, uh, pretty heartbreaking. The concept behind it,

839
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:55,100
where you're one of the turtles and the other three are dead. And so you're carrying their,

840
01:17:55,100 --> 01:18:01,100
their, your, their weapons with you. And you're trying to seek some vengeance, um, to get, you

841
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:08,140
know, justice for their murder. Um, and it's really dark. It's really dark, but it still has some of

842
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:15,820
the, some of the same heart, you know, packaged in it. But at any rate, there is a teaser put up

843
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:22,540
and, uh, that's for, uh, uh, a game, uh, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Last Ronin, the game.

844
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:27,580
Um, the, the trailer is just some pretty kind of generic stuff. Um,

845
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:36,540
Strong Bad Game. Sorry. I got distracted. Thanks. It's Loki. No, you're not. It's okay.

846
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:46,540
It's dangerous. So that's fine. Um, but anyway, uh, there's no real details on it. There's not a

847
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:53,660
release date, not a window for it, but the trailer is really pretty. And if they do it right, this is

848
01:18:53,660 --> 01:19:01,980
going to be a really good dark story. It has a very unique art style that is very much not the

849
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:06,460
nineties iteration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that most of us associate with Ninja Turtles.

850
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:13,180
Let's be real. It's, it's honestly, uh, quite a bit, uh, like the comic, it looks a lot like

851
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:23,740
how the comic looked. Um, and I mean, the comics are, are they've been like the very original ones

852
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:31,980
were quite dark. They were quite dark and, uh, and, you know, really, really just the stories

853
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:39,260
were definitely geared a little bit more adult, you know, so at any rate, at any rate, it's,

854
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:46,700
it's, um, I'm hoping that the, that the game, uh, matches the, the comics in quality.

855
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,860
Well, some folks in our chat room are already pretty impressed with where it's headed. Quest

856
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:58,220
Buster saying the last Ronan is so good. I hope the game turns out well, uh, tiger claw pointing

857
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:02,220
out, they're continuing the comics. They released new comics. That's a prequel and a sequel,

858
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:08,780
and it introduces a new generation of Ninja Turtles. Yeah. Now I don't know. The one thing

859
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:17,660
that, um, I was keeping up with the IDW, um, series, you know, just the, the ongoing one.

860
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:26,780
And it was just going from how those have been to this. I definitely am seeing it as sort of like

861
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:33,500
an alternate future sort of thing from that continuity, but still it's, it's, it's really

862
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,140
good and pretty dark. So, and I'm not going to spoil who the surviving turtle is for those who

863
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:44,940
don't know. Okay. All right. Well, let's move on and let's see if, uh, this, the market can survive

864
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:50,140
the rerelease of this game Loki, cause this is an interesting story. Not even a rerelease. It's

865
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:55,740
a port, which is even worse. Uh, I mean, I guess it's technically you're releasing again, but on

866
01:20:55,740 --> 01:21:03,260
another system. So, um, this stinks of the grand theft auto San Andreas definitive edition, but

867
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:09,420
it's not, it's basically a port of the original red dead redemption, which is coming out now for

868
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:18,060
the switch and the PlayStation five. Um, why not Xbox? Because there's already a version that is

869
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:24,620
playable on Xbox and for less money. Uh, this version is going to be $50. What have they done

870
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:29,900
to the game? Not really much. They haven't really remastered anything on it. Actually,

871
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:35,980
it's just a straight port plus the undead nightmare DLC, which was like the game of

872
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:39,420
the year edition that they sold for 20 bucks, but now they're selling for 50.

873
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:45,340
Please don't support this. It's awful. Especially since they didn't port at the PC either. So

874
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:54,300
whatever. I mean, I don't know. I just would not support this stuff. Of course, CEO Strauss

875
01:21:54,300 --> 01:22:00,300
Zelnick thinks it's a great price. It's we, we, we believe it's a commercially accurate price for it.

876
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:05,580
How about we wait for a deep sale instead, because you know what? There's no rush to play

877
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:11,580
red dead redemption on any modern console now, because it's been out for a long time.

878
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:16,620
I'm sure there will still be people that buy this and whatever it's fine, but they shouldn't

879
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:21,980
support it at $50 because it's all that, that sends a signal to rockstar games that they can

880
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:26,300
just do whatever they want, put it out and people will just eat it up for whatever price they put

881
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:33,900
it out there. And like, especially like we got burnt by the, um, definitive edition, like

882
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:39,100
absolutely do not pre-order this and wait for the reviews to come out before you play it. Cause

883
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:45,100
yeah, the switch isn't a powerful piece of hardware and we're talking about running

884
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:52,620
red dead redemption on it. I would wait for the reviews. PlayStation five, probably fine.

885
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:59,580
Here's something else with the price and all that stuff. I feel like the industry, like not just,

886
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:05,900
you know, take two and whoever, like the entire industry needs to remember why did the Wii U fail?

887
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:11,020
There's a lot of reasons why the Wii U failed, but here's one big reason that we, you failed

888
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:14,140
is because when you look at the launch software that came out for the Wii U,

889
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,460
the vast majority of it was stuff. And even the things that they were highlighting at E3,

890
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:23,100
when they announced the Wii U, yes, there were some original things on it. And, you know,

891
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:27,660
none of it was of the same quality of the launch titles of other systems before it. But I digress.

892
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:32,060
The real issue was there were a lot of these third party games that were coming out,

893
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:37,180
things like mass effect three, uh, the Batman Arkham games, you know, and all this stuff.

894
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:41,900
There were these games that were coming out that had already been out for a year,

895
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:47,340
had already been discounted as a result. And now they were trying to put these games out on the

896
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:53,020
Wii U at the full retail price. And then they were wondering why do people not buy these games?

897
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:59,340
And I'm reminded too, that this version of red dead redemption doesn't have multiplayer,

898
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:06,220
which was fun. I used to play the multiplayer of red dead redemption with my coworkers and it was

899
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:11,820
a, it was a great time. Not part of it. You're, you're getting even less content for more money.

900
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:18,140
Zen monkey 11 quite bluntly says, fuck that shit. I won't even buy it on sale.

901
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:24,380
I, I get it. Uh, as John Hunter, Matt says that same CEO got his salary doubled recently. I'd

902
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:29,260
like to see how he justifies that. Excellent question. Uh, making billions of dollars on

903
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:35,580
the stupid app, you know, shark cards is how he does it, which isn't his doing like he just sits

904
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:40,620
there and collects money. Uh, while we are in chat says PC port probably coming later because that's

905
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:49,020
what rock star does. Hmm. Well on the PC front and eventually the console front as well. Uh,

906
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:54,220
we have, uh, this, this game has been everywhere. This is another one of those games. I know we

907
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:58,780
talked about Palia earlier, but this game is also just taken over Twitch. I have a ton of friends

908
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:03,580
that have been streaming this game and it's Baldur's gate three. And I got to say this game,

909
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:07,260
like I never really got into the older Baldur's gate games, which I know were hugely popular at

910
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:12,540
the time. Um, but the, just watching people play this, it kind of has my attention and I'm like,

911
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:18,060
Oh, should I be picking this up? I don't know, but the game is not without its own issues.

912
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:26,300
Uh, apparently, uh, some translation folks that worked on the game, uh, namely outsourced workers

913
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:33,100
were omitted from the games credits, uh, founder and CEO of the Altagram group,

914
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:37,900
which was the studio that handled these translations said we take full responsibility

915
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:42,620
for this omission of our freelancers names and apologize for the effects that it had.

916
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:47,980
We would like to thank Larian, the makers of, um, Baldur's gate three for allowing us to quickly

917
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:53,180
fix that error and update the credit section. The names of the Brazilian Portuguese translators will

918
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:58,700
be included in an upcoming patch to the game. Let's let, let us take a moment to remember

919
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:04,460
Brazil is a very large country, and that's a lot of potential sales. And to do that,

920
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:09,260
you need a hardworking translators, you know, localizers as well to work on your game to do

921
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:14,380
that. So even though for you, me, most people that listen to this show, because we don't speak

922
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:19,100
Portuguese, it doesn't seem like a big deal to leave these folks out. It's a huge deal to leave

923
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:24,860
these folks out when an entire country, you know, relies on them essentially and others to not just,

924
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:30,380
but that's been the largest one to be able to play this game and make it more accessible. So

925
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:36,300
that's really unfortunate. I don't know how the fuck that got overlooked. I have a feeling if we

926
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:41,180
worked in a unionized industry, it would have been a lot harder to overlook, but I, I'm getting on a

927
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:48,540
different tangent perhaps. Anyway, um, Larian studios did say Altagram was to blame for the

928
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:52,700
oversight and they asked the company to rectify the situation. And of course, of course they

929
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:57,820
obliged. They kind of have to do that. Um, but it's worth pointing out. Outsourced workers don't

930
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:03,340
always get fully credited for their work. This can sometimes impact future projects. It can be

931
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:09,500
difficult to prove that you worked on a potential game to a new employer. Um, you know, I know a lot

932
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:13,900
of people just skip the credits and don't look at them. I get it. The games that are coming out these

933
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:19,740
days have very long credit sequences and people tend to skip them, but that's important to the

934
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:24,060
people that worked on the game because even to have that moment of look, it's my name and the

935
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,060
game, and then to be able to put that on something like your LinkedIn profile or whatever, that's

936
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:35,100
huge and that's important. So let's just hope that this gets fixed for the future. But of course,

937
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:40,380
there's another cloud hanging over all of this. They'll probably be developers that are going to

938
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:46,220
try to get artificial intelligence, which is really machine learning, but automated, we'll say

939
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:51,580
automated translation services to do that. All I'm going to say with that, you all have used

940
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:57,340
Google translate. I don't think machine learning is going to be that much better at it. You get

941
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:03,740
what you pay for. Period. End of sentence. Do not leave these entire countries out because

942
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:10,380
you think chat GPT can do the job of a human being when it comes to language, which is how we

943
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:20,060
express ourselves and share culture. It's so infuriating. Anyway, maybe I have the WGA strike

944
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:27,020
fresh in my mind and some of the things they're fighting for. Who knows? Anyway, we need to take

945
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:32,140
a moment to go back to a simpler time. So I think it's time to call in the next segment to save us

946
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:48,540
here. Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out

947
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:55,740
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. But once a month,

948
01:28:55,820 --> 01:29:02,220
Dark Sakura flips the script with a non-video game. So Dark Sakura, what did you pack for us

949
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:11,660
tonight? The game is Don't Break the Ice. It is a tabletop game for two to four players,

950
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:20,620
three ages and up. And it was first marketed by Shapper Toys in 1968, sold to Hasbro as a

951
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:26,060
subsidy of Milton Bradley in 1986. And it's still in production with very special versions,

952
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:33,420
including Frozen and Frozen 2. So basically you have these ice blocks and a stand

953
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:39,660
and a miniature plastic hammer for each player. And one block is bigger than the rest. And there

954
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:46,380
is a plastic character sitting on it. And some additions, it's Phillip the penguin and a dude

955
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:53,100
called Iceman or a polar bear. To set it up, basically you turn the stand upside down and

956
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:58,860
you put all the blocks in so that the, I mean, basically it's using compression to hold all of

957
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:05,020
the blocks in place, you know. And then you take turns removing blocks by tapping with the hammer.

958
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:10,140
And when one player causes the block with a character to fall through,

959
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:19,180
then the person before that is the winner. So, but I mean, very simple premise for a game,

960
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:25,740
you know, it, I would imagine that, you know, it's various versions are really just limited

961
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:30,300
to anything kind of snow theme, you know. But I mean,

962
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:39,740
many different covers it's had, so many different, you know, ways that their little

963
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:48,940
thing has looked, the brace for it. And you can still, you know, go to, like, I think it's like

964
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:57,980
17 bucks through Hasbro, but you can get it practically at any store. And from the Hasbro

965
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:06,140
edition box, I'll go ahead and read the little poem it comes with. Tap out ice blocks one by one,

966
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:11,820
they won't melt when you are done. Take your time and do some thinking to keep the polar bear from

967
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:16,220
sinking. To win the bear must stay on top. One wrong block, he'll go kerplop.

968
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:24,940
And a notable thing is that in 2004, this one, the Japan board game prize for best

969
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:31,260
child game. Actually, I take that back, it was just nominee. But, but that's the game.

970
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:42,220
Don't break the ice. And I mean, like, even the original box. It was very 60s. But like this,

971
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:46,780
this game is just fun. You know, it's good fun. And I like putting things other than the little

972
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:50,940
dude on top. You know, like putting a Sonic figure up there.

973
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,820
You know, like putting a Sonic figure up there.

974
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:58,060
Oh, amiibo would be good for the answer. Those might be a little heavy.

975
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:02,620
Amiibos will be too heavy. Maybe like a little gotcha pun figure.

976
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,420
Yeah, something you get out of a vending machine for a quarter.

977
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:10,860
bonds 006 and chat says my attention span would not want to play this the setup and

978
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:15,340
downtime is too much. Well, this guy in the YouTube really that long. I know this guy in

979
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:20,380
the YouTube videos moving at a glacial pace pun intended. I don't remember the game taking this

980
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:25,180
long to set up to be quite honest. So I'm sure he's explaining things that we have muted while

981
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,940
he's doing this. But yeah, usually you just you get everybody to collect the pieces and you can

982
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:32,540
set it up pretty quick. Like it's just Yeah, you know, that big block. I mean,

983
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:39,900
if a bunch of junk queer people can do it. Yeah, and it's not an ASMR video. It's just a review

984
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:47,900
of the game. But I mean, we did it. We made it work. Phil of nine is in chat. Who is there that

985
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:54,940
night that infamous night grandpa's so yeah, it was good time. That was also the night that

986
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,860
that I think we decided to buy grandpa's house.

987
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:04,380
Except somebody else bought it because he didn't live there.

988
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:10,620
No, no, this house. Oh, oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was thinking of the house we were at

989
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:17,340
that night. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I always Yeah, I always I honestly Jamie, I forget that grandpa

990
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:21,500
lived there. Which is funny because I don't remember sitting on the back porch. I know

991
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:26,460
what I named furniture. Now that you say it. I do. But sometimes in my brain, I don't associate

992
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:32,460
it with being the same house. You know what I mean? Yeah, even though Yes, it is. So it's just

993
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:40,300
funny. Well, if this is my house, you feel like it. You get the fuck out. Anyway, I it's being

994
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:44,300
mentioned our chat by Jim Sally since we were talking about you know, if drunk queer people

995
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:50,460
can do it. Jim Sally and chat says we high straight people can do it too. Yeah, well,

996
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:56,940
I'm glad. Where's the where's that meme? Where it's like, you know, the hands shaking where

997
01:33:56,940 --> 01:34:02,700
that might be the quote unquote opposing views, drunk queer people, high straight people playing

998
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:07,500
don't break the ice. There you go. You have the little little world peace agreement there. All

999
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:13,260
right. All right. If the high straight people and the junk gay people teamed up,

1000
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:22,380
the world would be in trouble. Or, or something. All right. Let's move on and talk about some

1001
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:26,860
other headlines at a rapid pace and what we call rapid fire news. Loki.

1002
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:36,540
Yes, the lollipop chainsaw remake is been delayed. Wasn't quite part of the developer digital delay

1003
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:42,700
announcement, but it's its own delay announcement, I guess, coming out next summer now. And then

1004
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:51,980
Netflix just released a app to turn your phone or tablet into a controller for playing their games,

1005
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:57,500
I assume on TV. That sounds horrible. I'd rather have a controller to do that. But

1006
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:06,300
at least it's an option. I mean, that works for like jackbox. But it's a very particular

1007
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:12,380
type of game that a phone controller will work for. Yeah, but when they're talking about like

1008
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:23,100
Assassin's Creed, no, I would rather not. Same. Same. All right, moving on dark soccer.

1009
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:30,380
So Sega has some announcements for Samba de Amigo Party Central. They put out their roadmap for the

1010
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:36,780
DLC. On August 29th, we will have the Sonic the Hedgehog music pack for five bucks,

1011
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:42,460
as Open Your Heart, Reach for the Stars, and I'm Here. And then the Japanese music pack,

1012
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:49,260
which is Kaikai Kitan, Matsuken Samba 2, and King, which is a Hatsune Miku one.

1013
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:57,420
On September 27th, we have Sega Music Pack, Bakamitai Taxi Driver Edition. We have Go Go

1014
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:03,180
Cheer Girl from Space Channel 5 Part 2, Rhythm Thief Theme from Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's

1015
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:10,300
Treasure, and then a K-Pop pack with details to be announced. So you can still get the Digital

1016
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:15,740
Deluxe Edition that has the standard version of the game, the Sonic the Hedgehog music pack,

1017
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:22,300
the Sega music pack from September 27th, a Sonic the Hedgehog costume and accessories pack,

1018
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:26,540
a Tails costume and accessories pack, Super Monkey Ball costume and accessories pack,

1019
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:31,820
P.O.P.O. accessories pack, which is what I want, and the Space Channel 5 costume and accessories

1020
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:37,900
pack. And then there's also the digital upgrade bundle, where you basically just pay extra for

1021
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:45,100
the bonus stuff. It will be out on the Switch on August 29th. Oh wow, that's really soon. I

1022
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:51,500
didn't realize Samba's like around the corner. That's pretty cool. All right. Well, music game

1023
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:56,460
fans, don't say I don't still love you because I have a new music game to talk about here,

1024
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:04,460
which is, I'm going to butcher the name of this, but it's Toho Danmaku Kagura Fantasia Lost.

1025
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:08,300
Toho. Toho. So this is basically

1026
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:17,500
a rhythm game around the Toho project, and it is coming out for PC on Steam on February 8th.

1027
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:25,340
So also, and of note to other gaming fans, there will be a collaboration song with Toby Fox from

1028
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:29,340
Undertale, who, you know, of course, created and did the music to that game. He's basically

1029
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:31,980
the John Carpenter of video games. How many more versions of

1030
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:34,140
Megalovania can we get? All of them.

1031
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:38,460
It sounds like this is actually a new song because he's collaborating with

1032
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:43,980
Zune from Toho Project to actually do this as free DLC. So that's kind of cool.

1033
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:48,380
There are two different rhythm games within this, the Kagura stage, where you hit the notes

1034
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:54,220
at the right moment and you stack up combos and get the high score. And then a Danmaku stage,

1035
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:57,820
which is what we're seeing on Twitch right now, if you're watching, which is a shoot them up

1036
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:03,580
mixed with a rhythm game. That's kind of neat. I like that. That might be worth checking out

1037
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:09,100
there. You hit the notes on the sides rhythmically to do damage to the boss, and then you do missions

1038
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,500
and do all that good stuff there. So, oh, that's kind of neat.

1039
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:17,660
It's like a neat little spin on that. And, uh, you know, from a, from a franchise that a lot

1040
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:22,460
of people know about. So yeah, it looks very pop and music a little bit, a little bit. So remember,

1041
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:26,460
it's going to be, I believe it's on the switch as well at some point, but right now it's going

1042
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:30,860
to be on steam. I thought I saw something about a switch release at some point. I mean,

1043
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:35,900
I'll probably get it. Yeah. Uh, I do kind of wonder if I would be able to hook up my

1044
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:41,500
pop-in controller. Oh, maybe that would be fun. Uh, Chad Leland's in chat. Hey,

1045
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:47,980
Shane say he's also a Pokemon composer now to me, his stuff in Scarlet violet is real good. Yeah.

1046
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:52,860
I mean, they, and it's not just making love. He does new pieces for stuff. He's a very good

1047
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:57,580
composer. Again. It's it's like, he's the John Carpenter of games. Like he directs the movies

1048
01:38:57,580 --> 01:39:03,420
and, you know, obviously that iconic Halloween soundtrack with a piano that John Carpenter wrote

1049
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:09,820
that. So that's, yeah. I've, I've, I don't know if you've heard me say it, Rob, but when I'm in

1050
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:16,380
chase against a, uh, uh, um, a Meyers, I almost called him Kyle. We call him Kyle. Why do you

1051
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:22,700
call him Kyle? That's Shayla. Shayla is the one who started it. So now like when we're mad at him

1052
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:30,780
is like Michael Kyle, Albert Alfonso Meyers, you know, the second. Oh, his legal name. I see. Yeah.

1053
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:37,580
But, um, but when, uh, whenever the chase music is like go away, John Carpenter, because I took

1054
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:44,060
it from that. There's a parody out there that, you know, John Carpenter's following Michael

1055
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:53,660
around with, with his little keyboard. Yeah. Perfect. All right. Uh, with that,

1056
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:57,580
let's travel around the world and check out what video games are coming out this week.

1057
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:02,860
We'll start in the U S with Loki. All right. Yeah. We have quite a few things coming out

1058
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:09,580
this week, actually. So starting off with Everspace 2 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox series,

1059
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:16,940
HammerWatch 2 on PC, Moving Out 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

1060
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:25,740
Xbox One and Xbox series, Unguard on PC, the Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood on PC and Nintendo Switch,

1061
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:35,340
uh, Afogato on PC, uh, Kentucky Route Zero on the TV edition. I don't know what that is exactly.

1062
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:44,140
That's on a PlayStation 5 and Xbox series, Marble It Up Ultra, which, um, is, you may remember this

1063
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:50,780
as Marble Blast Ultra. They changed the name. Uh, that is now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

1064
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:56,220
PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series. That's like one of the first, uh, Xbox live arcade games

1065
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:03,900
that I had. Um, reminder, don't buy this game, uh, Red Dead Redemption coming out on Nintendo

1066
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:08,700
Switch and PlayStation 4 this, uh, oh, I thought it was PlayStation 5. Oh, okay. Well, that's even

1067
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:16,140
worse. Uh, well, PlayStation 4, um, Shadow Gambit, The Cursed Crew on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox

1068
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:24,620
series, uh, Shinobi Non Grata on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. And, uh, this is a better use

1069
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:29,340
of your money right here on the Nintendo Switch, Vampire Survivors coming out on Nintendo Switch.

1070
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:37,020
And then, uh, last but not least, we have a few more for Friday, uh, Bomb Rush Cyber Funk on PC

1071
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:43,100
and Nintendo Switch. Also another title well worth your money versus Red Dead Redemption,

1072
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:51,180
um, Madden NFL 24 on PC, PlayStation 5, uh, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox series,

1073
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:55,820
Radiant Silver Gun. I swear to God, it's like coming out every single week. That's on PC.

1074
01:41:55,820 --> 01:42:01,740
This is like Ikaruga again. Uh, that's true. And last but not least, um,

1075
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:08,380
Texas Chainsaw Massacre on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series.

1076
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:13,180
All right. Well, that's it. That may not be a Halloween video game, but that is a different

1077
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:17,980
Dead by Daylight Killer getting its own game. Uh, and that, that one looked interesting in

1078
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:22,620
the previous. I don't know if it looked more interesting than DVD to me. It just,

1079
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:28,220
I don't know. I, it looked, it looked like it was a lot more faithful to the, um, movie than I would

1080
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:34,940
have thought. I was very surprised that like, wow, they actually did kind of create a, um,

1081
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:39,020
what do they call it? Asymmetrical multiplayer game out of the movie. That was pretty surprising.

1082
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:47,100
So, uh, all right. Let's let you know, there was that big, big, there was that big thing though

1083
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:53,180
that got leakers in trouble for saying that they were, they had data mined and that, you know,

1084
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:57,900
uh, Bubba was going to be gone from the game and they use that to catch people.

1085
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:03,020
Yeah. And, uh, it turns out you can, you can be in Dead by Daylight and still have your own video

1086
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:08,860
game. So if, uh, the folks from stranger things and Netflix are listening, uh, both those things

1087
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:14,380
are possible as it turns out. So, uh, at this point I would travel to Japan and tell you what's

1088
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:19,180
coming out this week in Japan, but guess what? Nothing is coming out this week in Japan. I don't

1089
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:25,260
know what, and it's not golden week, so it's not that, but for whatever reason, there's, there's a

1090
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:29,900
third party converter. Like if you want to use different controllers on your PlayStation five,

1091
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:34,140
like there's a con that that's, that's not really a game, but that's like the only thing that's

1092
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:41,260
coming out, uh, in Japan for whatever reason. So go figure. Um, the break manager says, sorry,

1093
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:47,340
mountain day. Uh, the break manager says, I liked, I liked the Friday, the 13th game. I like the

1094
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:52,300
original NES one, but I know you're bringing up the asymmetrical multiplayer one that got

1095
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:56,940
fucked by licensing, but I would, I would argue without that game, we probably wouldn't have the

1096
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:02,060
success of something like day dead by daylight. It's a bummer that licensing issues and greed

1097
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:06,300
essentially really fucked that Friday, the 13th game, because that was fun. It was different. It

1098
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:11,500
was different experience. Um, I just hope with the closure of that, maybe they'll finally license

1099
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:15,260
Jason for the big game. We want to see him in, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

1100
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:21,260
So, uh, let's go to Europe until then, until then we can just play trapper.

1101
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:26,780
Yes, you do have that. And the fact that the Friday, the 13th game, I believe is still running

1102
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:31,740
through the end of the year. Um, uh, yeah, I can't remember the exact day they were closing it,

1103
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:38,220
but I think you still have a little bit longer. Well, at any rate, um, for what's coming out in,

1104
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:48,060
uh, the UK and, and Europe on August 15th for switch Xbox PlayStation is moving out to, um,

1105
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:55,180
on the 17th for PlayStation and Xbox is gored on the 18th for those same two is the Texas

1106
01:44:55,180 --> 01:45:06,780
chainsaw massacre. Um, also Madden NFL 24 and also, um, uh, curse of the stars and that's it.

1107
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:14,940
All right. Sorry. I was typing something in chat and I want my keyboard going through,

1108
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:20,780
uh, let's touch on a couple other headlines and then we'll get to the mailbag as well as

1109
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:24,540
potentially maybe any calls tonight. We're going to get later on if you want to participate that

1110
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:29,580
way with our show, head on over to the green room over at vog network.com that's VOG network.com

1111
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:35,020
slash discord to join our discord server. Uh, and we do chat throughout the week in discord as well.

1112
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:41,260
And if you're a subscriber here on Twitch, uh, you actually get access to a special channel as

1113
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:46,620
well for, and sometimes we post little sneak peaks, such as the videos that we shot on Thursday,

1114
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:50,220
our subscribers had a heads up there and the subscriber chat. So check that out. You do have

1115
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:53,740
to have your Twitch link to discord. If you're sitting here going, I don't see that. And I'm

1116
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:57,260
subbed to the channel. Make sure your Twitch is linked to discord because otherwise it doesn't

1117
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:01,020
know how to set the settings that way. All right. Uh, some other headlines, Loki.

1118
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:09,420
Uh, so we just recently had a quake con. And with that, we got the announcement

1119
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:18,780
of a quake to remaster. So it is the original game, but better and now out on Xbox series,

1120
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:25,740
X and S and PC, and which is kind of surprising eight player split screen.

1121
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:27,180
That's pretty rad.

1122
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:33,820
It's pretty awesome. And, um, you know, being that it's a very probably light game to run on

1123
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:39,980
those consoles, uh, that's probably how you can get away with that. But, um, he said right now

1124
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:48,780
it is, um, also going to be, or apparently quick three arena is also being, um, or has been

1125
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:56,300
remastered as well, or is coming in, I guess for other, that's the best one. Yeah. So, um,

1126
01:46:57,580 --> 01:47:03,740
very cool. Yeah. I, I haven't played quake two and I remember quake two, not nearly as well received

1127
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:08,700
as one and three. Um, and, uh, but I, I'll check it. I mean, especially, I believe it's on game

1128
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:13,180
pass. So what's to stop me from checking it out. Uh, the multiplayer is always a lot of fun in

1129
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:17,020
those games. So, um, yeah, I might have to grab that on game pass and check it out. It sounds

1130
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:25,660
like a lot of fun. So cool. All right. Hmm. So neat, neat. All right. Moving on dark Sakura.

1131
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:33,820
Um, there is a new mobile game coming out in the final fantasy seven universe. That's, uh,

1132
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:41,260
going to add some backstory and be, uh, another little bit in the, in the whole series. Like

1133
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:47,020
basically it's called final fantasy seven ever crisis that expands the story and the universe.

1134
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:55,660
Um, but also retells, um, uh, more of what went on in final fantasy seven. Um, it's, uh, developed

1135
01:47:55,660 --> 01:48:05,100
by Apple bot, um, and, uh, other people involved in it for, uh, for, uh, as a scenario writer,

1136
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:11,180
executive producer and creative director is, uh, Nogima Kazushige, Kitasi Yoshinori,

1137
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:18,700
and Nomura Tetsuya respectively. And it's, uh, hearkening back to the chibi days of,

1138
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:22,140
of final fantasy seven in the early ones, but cloud has hands.

1139
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:29,100
Um, but it also does, but it also does include some stuff from the first soldier's backstory,

1140
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:36,460
which is another mobile game, and it will be free to play, but there are gotcha aspects,

1141
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:43,020
you know, like a gotcha bond to get weapons that you would put money into. Oh, there you go.

1142
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:49,020
Um, I never realized this YYR in chat says, um, there's a bunch of bonus material in the

1143
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:54,140
quake two remaster. I learned that it was never actually meant to be quake two until they ran out

1144
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:58,140
of time and couldn't come up with a good name and branding for it. So they called it quake two,

1145
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:02,460
added a nail to the logo and called it a day. Uh, makes sense when you consider they have almost

1146
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:06,380
nothing in common beyond the engine. Interesting. I never realized that that's interesting. Now,

1147
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:09,660
the break man commenting on that story, the dark soccer just read saying, uh, I wish

1148
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:15,260
Squeenix would give six, some of the love they give to seven. Yes. I think, I think there's a

1149
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:19,260
yes. I think, I think there's a lot of expanded universes. We'd like to see for some of the

1150
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:24,540
classic final fantasy games. At least we finally got the pixel remasters on consoles. Don't forget.

1151
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:27,980
I mean, we had it on PC, but we got the console releases for switch and PlayStation

1152
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:31,980
earlier this year. So there is that. And if you haven't checked out six and that, um,

1153
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:36,060
it's very good from what I understand. I need to play. I still need to stream those games,

1154
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:39,900
but here's my problem. I kind of just don't want to play Final Fantasy two. So I think,

1155
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:44,620
I think I am going to skip. I think I'm going to skip and I'm going to play like Final Fantasy

1156
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:50,460
four and six, and then maybe go back to three and five. Um, and then play two,

1157
01:49:51,260 --> 01:50:00,860
maybe as a channel point reward or something or something, or maybe I just I'll play more

1158
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:06,780
tunic instead. Uh, it's probably time better spent. All right. Um, I would also like to see

1159
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:13,980
a sequel to 16 for the record. I hope we get another game in the 16 universe. Um, but you know,

1160
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:16,780
I still feel like there's a lot of things that could tie up in the story, but

1161
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:23,580
I digress. Uh, the break band of chat says, am I the only one that didn't hate two? No,

1162
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:29,180
I'm sure you're not the only one that didn't hate two, but, um, maybe tonight you are. All right,

1163
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:38,220
let's move on to Loki. So this is interesting. Apparently the team behind some of the more

1164
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:46,460
popular multiplayer mods for grant of five and Reddit at redemption to, um, CFX dot re

1165
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:53,340
they are P coming part of rockstar games. So they're known for the, uh, mods, uh, five M

1166
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:59,500
and red M, which is, I think he's more by the role-play community to play some alternative,

1167
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:05,100
um, versions of the game within those two games, but now they're being rolled into

1168
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:12,700
rockstar games. He says a huge step forward in the growth of our community and, uh, an opportunity

1169
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:17,740
for us to work with rockstar games to advance the five M platform and the creative community

1170
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:22,220
surrounding it. While our day to day operations won't have any noticeable changes with rockstar

1171
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:25,980
support, we're going to continue to improve our platform. And we are truly excited for what this

1172
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:31,900
means for our users, community and creators. Uh, it's funny though, because literally a few years

1173
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:38,060
ago, they rockstar was kind of trashing them saying that the five M project is not an authorized

1174
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:44,060
alternate multiplayer service that contains code to design to facilitate piracy. Our policy on such

1175
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:48,220
violations in terms of service are clear and the individuals involved in this creation have had

1176
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:55,660
their social clubs accounts suspended. Way to go rockstar games. You guys are just bang up jobs.

1177
01:51:55,660 --> 01:52:01,980
It's almost as if you can be more productive working with your fans that are, they smell

1178
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:06,300
the money is what they did. They smell the opportunity to make money is they're like

1179
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:12,540
that too. We can monetize this. That's why they're tuned. You can't monetize banning people unless

1180
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:18,700
you're charging them to unban them. Don't steal that trademark patent pending. That would fly

1181
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:24,140
anyway. So I think this is going to probably be a good indicator. What grand theft auto six and GTA

1182
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:29,020
online two is going to look like is, you know, some more of this role play stuff in there as

1183
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:33,340
well since it's been popular. I mean, yeah, a lot of people have been into it. It's really

1184
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:37,660
fascinating. There's some Twitch channels and stuff that do it that, uh, is really interesting.

1185
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:43,020
So it's hard to believe that this game has been out for like, I know it's almost a classic game

1186
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:49,820
of the week already. Just about we'll see about that. I'll be the judge of that. Well,

1187
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:56,060
Loki might say when you're sick one grand theft auto online aside, like I don't like

1188
01:52:56,060 --> 01:53:01,100
grand theft auto. I, I liked the idea of grand theft auto online, but they ruined it like big

1189
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:05,980
time, like with what they did to it. All the monetization is just really bad, but some of

1190
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:12,060
the features in it are good. This, the single player game, very good. So like, I mean it,

1191
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:18,620
that stands alone on its, on its own, but yeah, online is just kind of, I like the races. I like

1192
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:25,580
the world, but like charging for literally everything is just awful. All right. Well,

1193
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:29,420
before we get to the listener round table tonight, I have one more story and this is going to make

1194
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:33,660
some people sad, but I really don't think this news is as bad as people are making it out to be.

1195
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:40,060
And that is that the Xbox game pass $1 trial is now being shortened. You used to be able to get

1196
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:46,460
one month of Xbox game pass for the low, low price of $1. But now this introductory offer,

1197
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:53,900
it's been halved. You only get two weeks for your $1 of Xbox game pass. And this is just

1198
01:53:53,900 --> 01:54:00,140
conveniently in time that star field is about to come out on Xbox game pass in a matter of weeks

1199
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:04,220
at this point. Really. I think the early access is happening while I'm away at dragon combat,

1200
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:07,820
the retail releases right after I returned, which would be the general game pass release as well.

1201
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:13,500
So it does kind of line up that that would be a potential reason why they don't want people

1202
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:20,940
playing and beating starfield for a dollar. Look, let's be honest. Many of us worked swindled,

1203
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:28,140
stretched, exploited the Xbox game pass system quite some time ago. It's been years. And when

1204
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:35,820
I say that, I mean, there were many people that loaded up on the dollar, the really cheap Xbox

1205
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:41,820
game or gold sales, converting that into Xbox game pass for three years and all that. Look,

1206
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:50,060
we've had our day times up starfield was not a cheap game to make two weeks is still not bad.

1207
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:54,220
If you're really not sure if you want game pass or not, but I kind of think, you know,

1208
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:59,340
at this point of game passes for you or not, and you probably should pay what it's worth to play

1209
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:04,540
starfield a little bit. So, but I'm sure, look, there's still, there's still ways that people

1210
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:09,260
are going to work the system hint. Cause I did this with Swiss. This is just being thrifty

1211
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:13,980
on the Nintendo switch. And I know I've told the story on the show. I'm going to tell it again,

1212
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:18,540
cause this works for Xbox as well. You can get at Costco and I'm sure there's similar deals

1213
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:25,660
out there. You can get $100 worth of Nintendo cards for $90. And then you can use that $100

1214
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:31,660
that you got for $90 to then get the two game voucher, which in turn you can use on the $70.

1215
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:39,020
I'm like, what is star soccer doing with her hands? Is she mapping on her fingers over there?

1216
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,260
I'm playing with my motion capture.

1217
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:47,020
Yeah, no, it's fine. Then you can get tiers of the kingdom for $70, meaning for the low, low price

1218
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:55,100
of $20, you can get a $60 retail game because you mapped the thing and you took advantage. Now you

1219
01:55:55,100 --> 01:56:00,380
could do a similar thing with Xbox, which I believe Costco and probably other outlets also

1220
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:07,100
sell a hundred dollars worth of cards for 90 bucks. And honestly around events like black Friday

1221
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:11,900
or, you know, around maybe the day after Christmas. No, usually not. Cause they want

1222
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:17,100
people to spend their gift cards at full value, but usually you'll find other deals to get these

1223
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:21,420
types of things like, you know, a PlayStation plus is one of them as well. You get them real cheap.

1224
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:26,860
So just something to keep an eye out for you can be thrifty and there's many websites out there,

1225
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:32,540
many social media feeds, uh, that help you be thrifty on your game shopping.

1226
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:39,580
So, all right. Uh, let's see. YYR in chat says, if you're all in on Xbox use Microsoft rewards,

1227
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:44,700
you can earn one free month of game pass ultimate every month. If you're okay with doing dailies,

1228
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:50,140
using edge and being playing their games, et cetera. So basically GPU is free forever.

1229
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:54,060
I was actually doing that for a long time and it was very effective. I would say I was maybe

1230
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:59,740
getting every other month free, but still it's a great way to do it. They also up to the number

1231
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:05,260
of points you need to redeem that now, but I'm not arguing the point because it's still a very

1232
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:11,020
thrifty way to get a month here or a month there of Xbox ultimate. And again, if you want to,

1233
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:16,940
you know, save up your points and redeem a couple of those at once, that might be another way to

1234
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:22,140
play star field, if that's the way you want to do it. So something to think about. Oh, interesting.

1235
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:27,580
YYR says the auto redeem price did not go up. I didn't realize that. That's fascinating. Okay.

1236
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:34,940
Good to know. Good to know. SSG100 Matt says I always do the Costco gift card thing with Disney

1237
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:45,340
cards before going to Disney world. Oh, clever, clever. Shane in chat says I use edge and I

1238
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:50,060
randomly have earned like 20 bucks. And I don't know how much, how now I have, how I have that

1239
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:54,700
much or whatever he's trying to say there. So what you, you can turn those into Xbox points and buy,

1240
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:59,100
I think you can even turn it into windows store credit. If you're like, I don't want to hook up

1241
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:02,620
my Xbox or whatever. Like you can, there's a lot you could do with that. You should look into that.

1242
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:09,180
All right. Well, we should look right now at our mailbag every week. You can participate with,

1243
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:14,940
you can participate with our show, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send an email.

1244
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:21,340
And I think, Oh, Shane says you can turn it into PayPal money really, but it's not going to be as

1245
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:26,300
good of a value. It's just money. Yeah. Money's good. Money's good. That's right. You can get

1246
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:30,140
things like target gift cards and stuff on there too. So I guess there is that. All right. All

1247
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:35,660
that chat aside, let's get to the emails tonight and the rest of our listener roundtables. So

1248
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:41,020
Dar Sakura. I'm actually trying to check the calendar cause there's a lot of spam in here too.

1249
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:48,780
So that was the, all right. Between August 31st.

1250
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:53,660
I saw one today. If you can find the one from today, I think that was the only one I noticed.

1251
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:59,660
Yeah. No, there were, there were a couple. There was one from, from the first and from the third

1252
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:04,940
by the same person. No, sorry. This one is the spam one that it wouldn't let me delete. There

1253
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:12,860
we go. All right. So yeah. Okay. Here we go. So hello, LR, long time, no email. I just figured

1254
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:17,900
I'd say hello and also send a long-winded comment regarding something discussed during the last

1255
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:23,340
episode and my poor broken eyes. I need to make this must be YYR because it opened hello, LR.

1256
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:30,460
Yes. Okay. So Microsoft rebranded the Xbox live gold as Xbox game pass core, taking a look at

1257
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:35,660
25 game library available to give us course subscribers. Loki wondered why folks

1258
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:40,140
wouldn't just pay, excuse me, hiccups. Wouldn't just pay the extra $1 and opt for game pass

1259
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:45,740
for console instead. But there's something there that lucky missed. Xbox game pass core provides

1260
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:52,140
access to online multiplayer. Xbox game pass for console does not. So in order to have both the

1261
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:56,300
real game pass and the online multiplayer, you need to subscribe to game pass. Oh,

1262
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:00,940
that's shady. I miss that too. Oh my goodness. All right. Sorry.

1263
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:05,500
So at the end of the day, this isn't much different from the previous setup.

1264
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:10,620
After all game pass for console never included Xbox live gold before. I don't blame Loki for

1265
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:15,500
getting this wrong. The only reason why he got it wrong was because the new branding is to be blunt,

1266
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:21,580
absolute bullshit. If you look at almost any popular tiered service, higher tiers include

1267
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:25,900
all the features of the tiers below them. These don't, which is super confusing to the point of

1268
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:31,260
being anti-consumer. Frankly, I am all struck at just how terrible this branding is. I expect that

1269
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:36,620
Microsoft would soon be flooded with support tickets from folks that expected online multiplayer

1270
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:43,020
for the $11 tier and didn't receive it. I get that they want to say they have more game pass

1271
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:48,220
subscribers than ever. And that was probably their main motivation behind this move. I get that they

1272
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:53,180
want to unite all of the subscriptions under one brand because that's what a lot of corporations

1273
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:59,500
do. But if that's what they wanted, I believe they should have just jacked the game pass console,

1274
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:05,100
priced a few more bucks, maybe to 14 and included all the multiplayer. Yeah, it would suck a little

1275
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:09,740
for the folks who aren't interested in multiplayer, but be a lot less confusing for everyone or

1276
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:14,460
perhaps even better, maybe they should just have left all of this alone. We're familiar with the

1277
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:18,860
current system and branding, so why mess it up at all? All right, capitalism, sigh.

1278
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:25,100
Anyway, that sucks, but you know what doesn't suck? Recently, someone set a new world record

1279
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:31,900
for Dance Pad speed running the original Legend of Zelda. You might ask, who you might ask? This guy.

1280
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:37,340
You can check out my Twitch or YouTube channels if you're interested in seeing this,

1281
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:41,500
or if you want to see a recent play test of some of the stuff I recently added to

1282
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:46,460
SuperDuper Multitasking, like the fast forward feature and the new single player gauntlet mode.

1283
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:50,380
But whether you check that stuff out or not, happy gaming. And of course, to our glorious

1284
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:54,380
hosts, thank you again for this show and have a great week. Keep on stepping YYR.

1285
02:01:56,380 --> 02:02:01,020
Of course, you're the one that set the speed run for the original Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad.

1286
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:07,740
This just sounds so you, and actually, you know I'm going to do this. Sorry. I'm going to pirate

1287
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:13,740
some content from YYR's YouTube channel, but I will point out you can find YYR on YouTube at

1288
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:20,780
YYR57695. You can find the channel there, and I'll just show you a little preview of what it

1289
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:26,940
looks like to actually run the Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad, and it's exactly what you'd think.

1290
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:33,500
That's, oh my God, yes, with the buttons and everything. That's incredible. Anyway,

1291
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:36,380
while we watch YYR speed run the Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad,

1292
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:40,140
and actually, can I say this too? How long is the speed run?

1293
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:49,180
Just under two hours. YYR, you hella need to submit them. Yes, I'm using the trademark

1294
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:55,420
Northern California term of hella. You should hella submit this speed run to Games Done Quick.

1295
02:02:57,660 --> 02:03:01,740
You really need to think about submitting the speed run to Games Done Quick. I'm just saying,

1296
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:06,460
I'm just saying. Anyway, if you can, yeah, I know that means time away and all that stuff,

1297
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:10,220
and you have a young one at home. But while we watch YYR do that on Twitch,

1298
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:12,700
I want to mention- It just occurred to me.

1299
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:15,820
What's that? I could do my rod caliber speed run.

1300
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:24,620
You could. YYR says it's not quick. It doesn't need to be. They do a Kingdom Hearts run that's

1301
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:28,380
like three hours long. You just have to be faster than other people doing it.

1302
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:33,100
Exactly, and the fact that you're doing it on a Dance Pad is fucking funny. I don't know,

1303
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:37,020
but I also know the pressure of that could be a lot, so I'm not going to push the issue,

1304
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:44,300
but I am going to say YYR, this is quirky enough that I think people would eat it up. I really do,

1305
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:47,580
but if you don't want to do it, I completely respect that choice.

1306
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:55,740
But I do want to respond to the part in YYR's email where he talks about including multiplayer

1307
02:03:55,740 --> 02:04:05,500
by jacking up the price a little bit to $14 and doing that. Here's a hot take, take it or leave

1308
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:10,860
it. I've been saying this for years. Why doesn't Microsoft just fucking eat the price already and

1309
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:20,540
give it to you for free? Because there is this disparity as there has been for years that you

1310
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:26,220
have games on the Windows Store that have multiplayer on them, and you don't need Xbox Live

1311
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:31,500
to play those multiplayer. I'm not going to put that thought in Microsoft's head. They would get

1312
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:42,140
eaten alive for that type of stuff though. If they want to have parity with what's going on on PC,

1313
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:49,660
they really should just make it fucking free for multiplayer on Xbox console anyway. Why not stick

1314
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:55,340
it to Sony when you have a chance? I don't know. It just seems a little silly to me,

1315
02:04:55,980 --> 02:05:01,660
but money, money, money. That's the end of the day. Money, money, money, whatever. Anyway,

1316
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:09,020
thank you YYR for the email. I do notice you're doing a great job, so I don't want you to take

1317
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:14,860
this the wrong way, but I am noting if you did this again and again, you probably could really

1318
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:21,500
optimize this run even more. So I have a feeling whether it's on the stage of GDQ or not,

1319
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:24,860
this is something we're going to see YYR do again, because this is kind of

1320
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:28,540
this is kind of rad actually. I really love this. I agree.

1321
02:05:31,580 --> 02:05:35,660
Breakman in chat says this guy is doing better with a mat than I can with a controller.

1322
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:39,580
This guy, he's right there. Breakman, he's sitting right next to you in the chat room.

1323
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:50,220
Turn to your left. Well, you know, just if anyone decides to ever use Dreamcast dance pads,

1324
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:56,460
the Konami logo is one of the attack buttons or that's how I beat dance caliber.

1325
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:03,180
There you go. Also use Taki. We have a call waiting in the green.

1326
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:06,140
I have another email. Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought,

1327
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:09,180
nevermind. Just kidding. Let's do the email and then we'll do the call.

1328
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:16,060
All right. This comes from Retertainment. This week, the ESRB submitted a post to the

1329
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:21,580
FTC to allow companies that sell video games to utilize facial recognition software as a way to

1330
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:27,740
verify the ages of potential customers. Now we can debate the effectiveness of such a proposal

1331
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:32,220
as well as whether or not potential customers trust pictures to such a system, but there's

1332
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:37,980
another question to be asked. Why is ESRB proposing this? I believe I have an answer.

1333
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:43,900
In May, Pornhub started blocking access to users in several cities, including Utah,

1334
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:48,380
instead of state, sorry, instead of Utah, over age verification laws passed in those states.

1335
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:52,700
In response to that legislation, many porn sites started rolling out facial recognition programs

1336
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:56,700
for its users that live in those states. From personal experience, I can attest that

1337
02:06:56,700 --> 02:07:02,060
the program utilized by those porn sites are similar to the program that the ESRB is proposing.

1338
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:07,260
So, can it be argued that the ESRB is being proactive about potential upcoming issues?

1339
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:10,620
After all, video games rank up there with porn as boogeyman and

1340
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:13,900
scapegoat notes that are used by conservatives. Take care of Retertainment.

1341
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:24,300
Interesting. That is so weird how they banned porn in certain states. Like,

1342
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:27,340
I'm sure people just use VPNs to get around it and all that stuff anyway.

1343
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:31,180
Right. They just block in IPs that come from a certain state. That's all they're doing.

1344
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:35,660
Yeah. At the same time, though, I mean,

1345
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:48,220
having the age verification on those sites, it's a good idea. I mean, in theory, maybe even to a

1346
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:55,980
degree in practice, but you're also dealing with the potential recording of minors without parental

1347
02:07:55,980 --> 02:08:03,020
consent. They'll just store it temporarily, I'm sure. And then later on, it'll leak out that they

1348
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:07,020
stored those images to train their AI. Some are going to argue it's still being

1349
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:13,660
recorded though, whether it's sent anywhere or not. And plus, I don't see how facial recognition

1350
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:21,180
software works. It's not a flawless system. And there's a lot of like 16 and 17 that grow

1351
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:26,860
full facial hair and stuff. It's wild. Did I ever tell you about my friend who,

1352
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:31,900
at the time, her six-year-old daughter could unlock her mother's iPhone with her own face?

1353
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:38,700
Oh my gosh. Because their facial structure was like they were almost twins, just one was older.

1354
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:46,700
Or identical twins actually doing the same thing. I had a friend in elementary school who went

1355
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:51,500
through puberty at a super early age. He was growing facial hair in the fifth grade.

1356
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,060
Oh.

1357
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,100
Yeah, it happens.

1358
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:58,940
I went through it in third grade at nine years old.

1359
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:01,020
Wow. So I feel like-

1360
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:03,820
I was the first kid with boobs.

1361
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:10,940
There's too many issues with this. I mean, yeah, at least the ESRB is trying to get out in front

1362
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:15,020
of it, but try again. That's my comment on that.

1363
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:21,340
And YYR says, the party of smaller government and less regulation, hypocritical shitheads.

1364
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:31,660
Basically, they just want to control the things that they don't agree with, like bodies

1365
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:35,020
and let everyone kill each other.

1366
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:41,900
Look at the stunt that was attempted in Ohio, like case in point. That's it. Anyway,

1367
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:43,820
we have one more email, right?

1368
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:49,340
No, that was the second one because I said we had- you said we had one. I said we had two.

1369
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:52,700
Well, I see a third that came in at 634.

1370
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:54,060
What?

1371
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:59,660
For fuck sake. No, I don't see another one.

1372
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,780
Oh, okay.

1373
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:11,740
Hey, OLRs, Jim, Sally and Daniel here. Choo-choo babies. You guys ever play a game on Steam called

1374
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:18,300
Rounds? A roguelike game, crazy jumpy, lots of goofy power-ups. It's taken over our gaming

1375
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:23,580
lives. Best $6 buck worth of gaming since Minecraft. Let us know if you want to play

1376
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:26,860
sometime. Chats later. XOXO, Jim, Sally and Daniel.

1377
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:33,180
A short, sweet, succinct email. Love it. Yeah. Your recommendation means a lot to me,

1378
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:39,260
Jim, Sally. I've not heard of it, but I do love me a cheap game. So I'll have to take a look at it.

1379
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:40,380
What game was that again?

1380
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:43,820
Rounds? Have you heard of this? I'm opening up my Steam.

1381
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:48,540
That and I need to buy Danger-esque because it plays on Apple.

1382
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:50,380
I'm actually trying to see-

1383
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:57,900
So the game that comes up for me is a card game? Is that the game?

1384
02:10:57,900 --> 02:11:02,380
I don't think it is because they were saying it was roguelike. I'll have to find it because

1385
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:05,100
the game that comes up for me when I search on YouTube is a card game and I don't think

1386
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:07,500
that's the right game. It's a 1v1 roguelike shooter.

1387
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:09,100
There's a link in chat.

1388
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:13,260
Ah, perfect. I was looking for like a YouTube gameplay, but that's all right. Okay,

1389
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:15,500
I'll check that out later after the show. Thanks for the rec though.

1390
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:19,420
And it's always good to hear from you, Jim, Sally and Daniel, of course.

1391
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:19,900
Choo-choo.

1392
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:25,580
And thank you for being one of my many guides in Disney Dreamlight Valley.

1393
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:29,340
All right. Now we're done with email, yes?

1394
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:30,860
Yes.

1395
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:31,820
All complete? Finished?

1396
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:33,100
Yes.

1397
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:40,940
Participate at orangelandradio.com. Now we can get to the telephone or in technology, the Discord.

1398
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:44,780
Let's bring in our caller for tonight who has been patiently waiting. Hi,

1399
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:46,460
you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1400
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:52,380
Hey, what a well-timed cough from Dark Sakura.

1401
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:52,940
Sorry.

1402
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:54,300
I believe I heard that was Shane.

1403
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:57,740
Yeah, I guess I'm passing COVID through the internet.

1404
02:11:57,740 --> 02:12:00,140
Oh no. Oh no, it's mutating again.

1405
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:01,340
It's called garlic bread.

1406
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:04,220
Well, I hope you're feeling better, Shane.

1407
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:11,980
I am. I have my voice mostly back, but I went and did Pokemon Community Day today for an hour,

1408
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:14,300
and that was a stupid idea.

1409
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:16,540
I thought you rage quit Go, and now you're back on it.

1410
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:22,540
I did, but I rage unquit too when there's a Pokemon I like, and it was Froakie.

1411
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,380
How am I supposed to pass up Froakie?

1412
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:25,020
Even I is so-

1413
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:26,620
You and your water types.

1414
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:29,100
It's true. It is me and my water types.

1415
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:33,740
It is so fucking hot here today, and I hate how they schedule these things.

1416
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:37,820
While there's a fucking heatwave going on, schedule it at the hottest point of the day.

1417
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:43,260
I get it. The globe is a big place, and they need to do something that works for

1418
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:47,420
Northern and Southern Hemisphere, but I'm really, really signing more and more onto

1419
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:52,860
the idea that they need to let us pick from three different three-hour windows what works

1420
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:54,860
best for us and do it that way. I know it's possible.

1421
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:58,380
Or even just the 11 to two or two to five. That's it.

1422
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:01,900
You just pick one of those two. You don't need to do three. That's just what it should be.

1423
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:04,540
But it was like 90, I think, here.

1424
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:09,180
But I got in the car. I couldn't find my Bluetooth Pokeball, which pissed me off.

1425
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:11,420
It's somewhere hiding in the house.

1426
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:16,140
But I got in the car, and I drove to one park, pulled over, caught all the Froakie there,

1427
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:19,660
and then drove to the park down the street, caught all the Froakie there, and I got two

1428
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:23,820
shinies. I was like, you know what? One of these is a two-star. Good enough for me.

1429
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:27,820
I'm done with Froakie Community Day. I'll catch up in December when the weather is better.

1430
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:31,900
Well, I timed it for right after seeing the Barbie movie.

1431
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:35,100
So I just went from the Barbie movie to go catch Froakie.

1432
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:35,900
Let's go see it.

1433
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:43,100
It's so good. It is so good. I cannot sing its praises enough. I want to see it again.

1434
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:45,820
For some reason, I'm actually surprised to hear this from you. You don't strike me as

1435
02:13:45,820 --> 02:13:52,380
the type that usually likes those kind of quotably silly comedy movies. It depends on the movie.

1436
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:59,420
Honestly, the humor was my type of humor. I did not expect that. And I loved so much,

1437
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:02,060
and I laughed so many times.

1438
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:05,740
Phil of Nine says, OMG, go see Barbie. What are y'all waiting for?

1439
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:10,700
So not to be a downer, but I do want to just gently remind. I was in Atlanta the weekend

1440
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:14,940
that it came out, and then my dad got really sick the next weekend, which was earmarked.

1441
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:17,180
I should have seen it this weekend, but I just didn't get around to do it.

1442
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:18,060
You were supposed to go.

1443
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:20,620
Yeah, I know, but things.

1444
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:26,460
So I do want to I want to brag that for my one hour of playing today,

1445
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:30,060
I did get 30 froakie shinies. So I was happy.

1446
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,020
You're disgusting.

1447
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:36,860
All right. What did you want to call it? You didn't want to talk about go with us tonight,

1448
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:37,660
though. What do you want to know?

1449
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:42,300
But I, of course, want to talk about Pokemon because it's like the only thing I live and

1450
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:48,620
breathe. So you guys talked about Pokemon presents, but you left off something very

1451
02:14:48,620 --> 02:14:55,180
important from presents in that they showed off four new Pokemon in Scarlet and Violet.

1452
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:57,980
Oh, that's right. The redos, right?

1453
02:14:58,700 --> 02:15:05,180
It's not. Well, I don't know what you mean by redos, but no, no, it's not just that. So

1454
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:13,180
they did show off Raging Bolt and Iron Crown, which are paradox forms of Raikou and Cobolion.

1455
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:13,680
OK, that.

1456
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:19,680
Yes, but beyond that, they had two new evolutions for previously

1457
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:25,920
existing Pokemon. Applin, which debuted in Galar Gen 8,

1458
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:34,880
used to only be known to evolve into Flapple. And I don't even remember the other one.

1459
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,520
That's the fat stupid one. I don't remember what his name is.

1460
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:46,160
But now he has an evolution called Diplen, where he looks like a candy apple. It's adorable.

1461
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:49,360
Yeah, I did. OK, I did see that. It was cute.

1462
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:55,040
And then Duraludon, also from Galar, has an evolution, didn't have one before,

1463
02:15:55,040 --> 02:16:00,880
into Archiludon. He just looks like a bridge. I actually kind of dig it. It's neat.

1464
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:04,160
But that's what you...

1465
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:08,400
One of them looks like that monster from Horizon Forbidden Dawn.

1466
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:12,160
That is Raging Bolt. Yes, it looks like a Tallnick from

1467
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:16,800
Horizon. Because that was in the VR demo thing I saw at Bobby's.

1468
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:25,280
Yeah, it's ridiculous. But more importantly than Pokemon Presents was that Pokemon Worlds

1469
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:33,120
ended this morning in the US around like 3am. And they had a whole bunch of new information

1470
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:40,160
for their various games. The first being Pokemon Unite, they announced three new characters.

1471
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:46,960
Blaziken, Mimikyu, and Meowth Skirata. So the grass cat is already in that game,

1472
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:54,880
which is frustrating. The Pokemon TCG is adding two new types of cards, Ancient and Future,

1473
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:59,280
but we don't know what they do. But for Scarlet and Violet DLC,

1474
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:07,440
the part two, the indigo disc, is adding all gen one through eight starters in the wild.

1475
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:12,880
You'll be able to catch them. A 19th teratype. I don't know what you're doing on screen. Are

1476
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:18,000
you riding a roller coaster? I don't get it. It's... Jamie's avatar looks like it literally

1477
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,680
passed away. Like when you were talking about Pokemon.

1478
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:25,600
Oh, I see it. Yeah. I was just trying to mimic it because it was so funny.

1479
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:29,120
Like we just both died because you won't shut up about Pokemon.

1480
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:33,280
No, I don't. I will talk about till everybody's dead. I don't care. It's fine.

1481
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:43,360
And so 19th teratype. And there's also new competitive moves that like one blocks healing

1482
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:50,560
from abilities and moves. And that's pretty cool. Also Pokemon Worlds next year is in Honolulu,

1483
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:58,720
Hawaii. So I very much want to go. I've already decided. Japan looked like a lot of fun. Way more

1484
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:03,760
fun than Fan Fest, which was the two things I wanted to decide between this year. So I'm gonna

1485
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:06,880
there's no Fan Fest next year. I want to go to...

1486
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:11,040
Now, don't spoil the video because I want people to go to our YouTube channel and check out your

1487
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:15,280
Fan Fest reactions in the video. You already do sound better today than you did even three

1488
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:16,880
days ago in that video, though. So...

1489
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:23,120
Yeah, I've got everything I had back then except my voice is back. So everything else is fine.

1490
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:23,620
Yeah.

1491
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:31,860
Oh, but yeah, that's all the Pokemon news. And I did. I did buy Baldur's Gate 3 because

1492
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:36,820
I'm getting sucked into the hype. I have not played it yet. Because, you know, Steam has

1493
02:18:36,820 --> 02:18:43,060
that two hours and you can refund it or with whatever within two hours. So I haven't even

1494
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:47,780
turned it on yet. I'm waiting for a period of like two hours straight where I can just kind of

1495
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:51,700
try it and see if I like it. Because it looked a lot like Dragon Age to me.

1496
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:53,780
Oh, what?

1497
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:55,220
So why can't it be two hours gay?

1498
02:18:57,220 --> 02:19:03,140
Whatever. That's stupid. Anyway. Yeah. So I'm excited to play that because it looked like

1499
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:07,300
Dragon Age Origins to me. I was like, well, I love that game. So maybe this will be...

1500
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:11,700
No, it does. It does give me big Dragon Age vibes, actually. Which is funny because Baldur's Gate is

1501
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:16,260
like, it's actually like an old classic. Like, those games have been out before. Like, it's

1502
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:19,780
number three for a reason, right? It's been years since it's been a long time since 2.

1503
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:25,540
But like, they're very classic, well known, you know, PC games. But yeah, I never got into them.

1504
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:30,820
I'm almost tempted to buy three. Shane, if I buy three, will you create a character that we can

1505
02:19:30,820 --> 02:19:34,420
play together like on stream or something? Well, you know, I love creating characters.

1506
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:39,220
So I would probably be down for that. I just have to make sure I'm down for the game. Because I asked

1507
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:43,380
somebody, would I like it? Explaining, you know, I only... I've never played D&D. I don't know

1508
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:46,740
anything about that stuff. But I've played Dragon Age. I was like, oh, this looks like Dragon Age.

1509
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:50,980
And like, yeah, but there's a lot of dice rolls. I'm like, that's fine. That usually just happens

1510
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:57,060
behind the scenes. So I'm sure it'll be okay. I mean, I've played D&D. To be quite honest,

1511
02:19:57,060 --> 02:20:03,140
like a lot of what we see in role playing games today is because of D&D. So like,

1512
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:08,740
if you were to play D&D, you'd be like, there's a certain familiarity to this, because I've played

1513
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:15,940
literally any RPG, you know? Yeah. And I hear there's like, just so much in terms of like,

1514
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:22,820
branching story paths, and just like, all these little things that affect the overall outcome.

1515
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:29,860
Like, that sounds very overwhelming and scary, but also very cool. Because like, I can't play

1516
02:20:29,860 --> 02:20:35,220
Mass Effect anyway, but one way. All my decisions are exactly the same when I play it. So I don't

1517
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:39,620
know how I would handle a game like this. That would just break me. Especially when I'm doing

1518
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:44,100
things to intentionally and deliberately shock you. Yeah, and then I will just kill you.

1519
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:52,420
I'm gonna tell you when Baldur's Gate 3 caught my attention. So please plug the kids ears for

1520
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:57,540
a minute here. It was when they showed that scene where you can like, fuck the bear. I was like,

1521
02:20:57,540 --> 02:21:03,780
that that's in a video game. I didn't even watch that. It's a druid thing. Like the druid shape

1522
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:10,180
shifts and they, you know, Discovery Channel, etc. So I was like, this is incredible. What is

1523
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:15,220
this game? I need to have it. I did see that they like, I saw like a patch notes where they had to

1524
02:21:15,220 --> 02:21:20,580
fix penises. I was like, this is hilarious. Like, this game is going to be amazing.

1525
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:26,180
All right, or something. Well, we have another call waiting to get on. So,

1526
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:29,940
Shane, I'm gonna let you go. But thanks so much for joining us tonight. I appreciate it.

1527
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:35,300
No problem. Bye. Take care. Bye. All right. As I promised, we have another call waiting

1528
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:39,700
to come on air. So let's do it. Hello. You are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1529
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:47,700
This is Choo Choo Jim Sally. Jim Sally. Jim Sally. Always a pleasure to hear from you.

1530
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:54,020
Is Daniel with you too? Daniel is asleep in bed, so now we may speak at an R-rated level.

1531
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:58,500
Oh, good. I'm glad to hear. He stayed up just long enough to hear you guys read our email

1532
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:04,020
from today. He's fucking on. That's awesome. I love that. I'm glad he didn't hear the part

1533
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:09,780
about the bear. That's what I did. That's the last one. I just turned down before you call.

1534
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:24,900
Yeah. I'm hoping that animal kingdom thing and not a Toronto church and lovely kind of thing.

1535
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:30,260
It's hashtag just druid things. So what's on your mind tonight, Jim Sally? To what do we

1536
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:37,380
all the call? Well, I was good about also, I'm just finishing this J. I was good about that

1537
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:42,900
round game that I'm talking about. Yeah. So one versus one game where you shoot each other and

1538
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:49,140
then the loser gets to pick a little power up. Like maybe they jumped further or they have poison

1539
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:53,620
bullets or some shit, and then you fight again. And then the loser of that next battle gets to

1540
02:22:53,620 --> 02:23:00,660
win. And my boy has been still obsessed with this game. It's been, it's unbelievable. When I think

1541
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:07,700
about how much money I've spent on other games for him to die in a day or two. But this stupid

1542
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:13,700
$6 one v one game. It's just tucked them in. I think I think they put something in the background

1543
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:18,180
where it flashes that it hypnotizes you or something. Is this the game on here that I just

1544
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:25,060
put onto the discord? Oh, you got it. This is it. Okay. This is all it is, man. It's it's the

1545
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:31,060
I can't believe it. This looks like the type of video game that they have playing at conventions

1546
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:36,500
that have time. Okay, I see the power ups. Okay, I get it. This was a type of video game like stick

1547
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:43,300
fight a whole bunch of people are crowding around a TV. It's giving me big. Oh, fuck. What's that

1548
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:48,500
10 player Killer Queen? I'm getting big Killer Queen vibes. We were we were there when Killer

1549
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:53,860
Queen was just being introduced. Yeah, they had one at Southern Fright. And funny enough,

1550
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:58,660
on the plane ride, very random aside on the plane ride out to Atlanta from Sacramento,

1551
02:23:58,660 --> 02:24:03,540
I met a guy that works with Killer Queen. And he was going to the same show. And I overheard him

1552
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:07,620
in line. And I was like, he's like, Yeah, I'm going out to Atlanta for a gaming show. And I just,

1553
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:11,220
you know, you know, me, I'm not shy sometimes. I was like, are you going to Southern Fright Game

1554
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:15,380
Expo? I turned around. He's like, Yeah. And so we ended up talking. I saw it was really funny.

1555
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:20,020
So cool. I wish I'd got his business card. I would have invited them on the show. But I

1556
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:21,620
thought I'd see him at the show and I never did.

1557
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:24,980
Well, still, yeah.

1558
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:30,820
That game does look really fun, though. For $6. I checked that out. And there's a shit ton of

1559
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:37,380
YouTubes out there. My goodness. Oh, my God, it's unbelievable. We actually saw one the other day I

1560
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:42,980
cracked my my modding cherry the other day, and actually learned how to mod a video game on the

1561
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:49,780
PC for the first time. Really? You'd be so proud of me. I download all of us who play The Sims.

1562
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:56,740
I know, right? I know, right? Or Minecraft. All the 12 year olds in my life know how to do it on

1563
02:24:56,740 --> 02:25:04,100
Minecraft. I didn't want to ask them because I felt stupid. Not us getting to that age where

1564
02:25:04,100 --> 02:25:08,580
the 12 year olds are showing us how to do things that was when I was 12. That was programming the

1565
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:14,020
VCR. That was the thing that, you know, my parents who were, you know, in their 50s at the time had

1566
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:19,380
to rely on the youngins to do is program the VCR. So my mom didn't know how to do it. And I

1567
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:25,460
understood the whole concept of if you put it on EP, you get six hours of tape, but it doesn't look

1568
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:30,340
as good because it uses less tape. Like she didn't understand any of that. She was just like,

1569
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:38,580
can you just tape Oprah or not? Brother, I remember one day trying to explain to my parents

1570
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:44,420
about getting a second VCR so I could copy the videotape from the jumbo video. And it took me

1571
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:49,460
like two months of arguing with them and they wouldn't believe me. And then finally I had to

1572
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:54,500
borrow a second VCR from, this was eight years ago, kids, so copyright doesn't matter. Okay.

1573
02:25:54,500 --> 02:26:01,300
It can bring the second VCR to my house. But I still remember my mom's face,

1574
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:04,340
like almost in tears that we were going to get free movies.

1575
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:09,540
Well, and also this is how you, you know, get over the ring virus.

1576
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:19,380
The funny thing about the videotape thing is that it's now starting to hit its nostalgia

1577
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:23,220
thing because you know what I'm seeing shared on social media now is things like

1578
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:29,140
I just found Titanic on VHS and we're watching it and fully having to switch the tape out and

1579
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:33,940
all that. And somebody else just yesterday on one of my feeds was like, I just found

1580
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:41,620
it still sealed the Star Wars release on VHS. It had a very distinct like look with the,

1581
02:26:41,620 --> 02:26:45,780
like it was when they re-released it. Uh, I think it was after the initial initial release,

1582
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:49,540
they like re-released it like THX sound or whatever was the fancy thing. And it had a

1583
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:54,660
very unique like logo and like it was unopened and they were like, should I open it to watch it?

1584
02:26:54,660 --> 02:26:57,460
What? I have those laser disks.

1585
02:26:57,460 --> 02:26:59,540
Oh my gosh. Yeah.

1586
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:03,540
I do. And guess what? We got them at Dimple for 11 bucks each.

1587
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:04,580
Oh, that's funny.

1588
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:08,660
Back in the day. Of course, I also have just a spinal tap with the guitar pick on it too.

1589
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:13,700
And Questbuster Han shot only.

1590
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:19,780
I love that a Jim Salley phone call is here to tell us about a new video game and suddenly

1591
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:24,820
descends. Uh, of course, of course we need the conductor of the train here to drive this tangent

1592
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:41,300
train into a talk about VHS videotapes. Don't tape over Rob's Alice in Wonderland from TV

1593
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:45,060
cause he'll get pissed. Carol Channing was in that, that, that, that. Anyway.

1594
02:27:46,820 --> 02:27:50,820
I still remember the day my GM, they drove me over for fucking Dancing with the Stars.

1595
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:52,020
Oh no.

1596
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:56,820
Fucking Dancing with the Stars. That was like the biggest heartbreak ever when you pop it in

1597
02:27:56,820 --> 02:28:01,220
and Dancing with the Stars comes up. And I just want to watch some Cobra Commander. I even had

1598
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:05,780
the, I even had the game series where that weird snake guy came over and there was an extra snake

1599
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:11,860
serpent or, and then they would all go and attack and shit. And it was fucking Dancing with the

1600
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:18,900
Stars, man. I had the whole run of Ronin Warriors taped off of VHS when I had my VCR set timed.

1601
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:23,700
And I realized that my VCR would actually start recording 25 minutes late. So I set it 25 minutes

1602
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:30,580
earlier. So I had every episode and then my brother taped over all the episodes with my

1603
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:34,980
favorite character who is Seiji, which I mean, I have them all in Japanese now, but still.

1604
02:28:34,980 --> 02:28:39,140
Several people in chat, several people in chat are bringing up cause dark soccer mentioned the

1605
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:43,140
beta max. There's several people in chat bringing up that they too had a beta max. And actually in

1606
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:50,340
my family, we also had a beta max first. And that was when I fell in love with clue the movie. I had

1607
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:58,340
clue the movie with all three endings on beta. And I wore that fucking tape out. I was seven

1608
02:28:58,340 --> 02:29:01,380
years old. Oh yeah. That was the big, that was the big thing with that movie. There were three

1609
02:29:01,380 --> 02:29:05,140
different endings when they released it in theaters, you would only see one of the three

1610
02:29:05,140 --> 02:29:10,180
endings. And it was, it was actually like in retrospect, there's a lot written about how that

1611
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:15,220
was actually horrible and detrimental to the movie's box office success because that movie

1612
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:21,620
found its footing when they would show it on TV over and over again on like, for me, it's channel

1613
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:26,820
31, but it's whatever your local independent, you know, a TV channel is. It just shows the movies

1614
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:33,700
all day long. They, they, and so many of us in that, you know, young, uh, you know, late Gen X,

1615
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:39,460
early millennial generation, like grew up watching clue the movie on TV over and over again with all

1616
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:44,580
three endings because they put it on VHS is had all the endings there and same thing on TV.

1617
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:49,380
That was one of my, one of my movies on repeat that the princess bride and high spirits.

1618
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:57,700
I love all day long. Yeah. Oh, good times. All right. Jim Sally, I'm loving this, uh,

1619
02:29:57,700 --> 02:30:01,860
walk down memory lane, but I do have to wrap up so we can wrap up the show tonight, but Jim Sally,

1620
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:06,820
it's always a pleasure to hear from you. I'm going to check out rounds and, uh, please, uh,

1621
02:30:06,820 --> 02:30:11,700
please send our best to Daniel. Okay. I will do probably good night, everybody.

1622
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:21,460
You take care. All right. Always a delight to hear from Jim Sally. What a guy, uh, I'm glad he's

1623
02:30:21,460 --> 02:30:25,460
back. He's been gone for a little bit and it's, it's really nice to have him back in the circle.

1624
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:29,140
Now it's, it's like, uh, being reunited with an old friend. I appreciate it. Absolutely.

1625
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:34,340
Absolutely. Um, okay. Uh, we're getting towards the end of the show. Uh, I want to make sure we,

1626
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:38,180
uh, wrap up here and, uh, get the final thoughts out and all that good stuff. Uh,

1627
02:30:38,180 --> 02:30:42,740
dark soccer. I know you are off to do your streaming thing. Um, so do you have a final

1628
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:52,100
thought for our listeners tonight? Um, only one, uh, one quote, so I chose to expose myself,

1629
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:56,180
please. There are ladies present. All right. Thank you. Excellent. All right. Perfect.

1630
02:30:56,180 --> 02:31:00,900
Uh, I'm going to get on the Debbie train. All right. Later taters. Good luck. Have fun with

1631
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:05,860
that. All right. We'll see you in a little bit. Um, as always, I want to thank everybody for

1632
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:08,980
listening to orange launch radio tonight. If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show,

1633
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:12,660
tell a friend or to help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

1634
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:17,140
a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air. So a nice five star review on a site like

1635
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:22,340
iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way. So, uh, would

1636
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:30,180
super appreciate all of that. Um, with that, I think we're down to the other final thoughts.

1637
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:32,340
So, um, Loki, your final thought tonight?

1638
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:38,740
Uh, my final thought was there was another game I played for my gaming week. I forgot to mention

1639
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:45,380
it. Um, it's, it's basically one of those, you know, how you have all those spam, um,

1640
02:31:46,900 --> 02:31:51,780
mobile game ads that have like, you know, you're no, never be smart enough to beat this type of

1641
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:58,500
thing. And they have the weird games on there. Well, they actually released a game that has those,

1642
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:03,780
uh, all in one collection. It has the most ridiculous title. It's called, yeah, you want

1643
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:09,380
those games, right? So here you go. Now let's see if you can clear them. That's the name of the game

1644
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:16,820
by the way. It's fun. All right. And then, uh, the other thing is, uh, there's going to be some major

1645
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:25,700
announcements next week. Just saying. Yes. Uh, on both from both of our ends. Yes, absolutely.

1646
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:30,260
I'm excited. Yours is real good though. That's all I'm going to say. All right. Um,

1647
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:37,060
so my final thought tonight, and you can blame dark soccer for this is well, someone's got to

1648
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:40,420
break the ice and it might as well be me. I mean, I'm used to being a hostess as part of my

1649
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:44,100
husband's work. And it's always difficult when a group of new friends meet together for the first

1650
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:47,860
time to get acquainted. So I'm perfectly prepared to start the ball rolling. I mean, I have

1651
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:52,180
absolutely no idea what I'm doing here, what we're doing here, what this place is about, but I am

1652
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:56,580
determined to enjoy myself and I'm very intrigued and oh my, the soup's delicious, isn't it?
