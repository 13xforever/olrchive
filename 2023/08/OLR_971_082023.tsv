0	14640	Twitch is now going to block banned users from watching your stream, finally!
14640	19200	It won't block them from watching clips, nor bots, nor signing out and watching your
19200	23400	stream again, but it did take developers time to implement and begin rolling out to check
23400	27140	off a box despite the immensely trivial workarounds.
27140	29340	This is the I forgot my microphone intro.
29340	32860	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
32860	36140	this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
36140	38820	every gamer has a voice.
38820	42580	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42580	47240	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47240	54460	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 971 of our
54460	58660	show for tonight, August the 20th of 2023.
58660	63020	My name is Rob Roberts and you just heard here at the top of the show there our voice
63020	67560	over guy Jason and yes, if his audio sounds a little different tonight, you want to talk
67560	68940	about dedication.
68940	72220	He's traveling right now, didn't have his normal microphone.
72220	78040	He did that with a laptop microphone from his car to get that audio intro in locked
78040	84960	in about 20 minutes ago tonight here as we tape live at the voice keys network vog network.com.
84960	89000	Speaking of dedication joining myself, Rob Roberts here every week is the one and only
89000	93880	dark Sakura or Jamie Summers dedication.
93880	103080	I mean, I dedicate this show to my bed where I collapsed into after a very long day yesterday.
103080	107120	Yeah, you were you were at California extreme this weekend, huh?
107200	108640	Yeah, sure was.
108640	110560	Yeah, I was able to make it again.
110560	118280	But it was something very busy and I'm glad honestly enough for everyone who talks shit
118280	119280	about crocs.
119880	123080	They are damn comfy for for a long convention.
123280	125680	Maybe, maybe I need to get some for Dragon Con coming up.
125680	126200	Who knows?
126600	128480	So did you have a good time?
129000	130000	Did you have a good time over?
130000	131640	I know we'll get into some of the games you played and stuff.
131640	133440	But did you have a good time overall at California extreme?
133480	134880	Oh, I totally did.
134920	136280	I totally, totally did.
136320	143040	And I came home with a cute little Pikachu that if you're following me on the socials,
143560	144440	you might have seen it.
144640	145080	I did.
145080	146360	I saw a cute little picture.
146360	146840	What was it?
146840	149920	Was it like a it was like a World Championship Pikachu or something?
150120	150480	It's cute.
150520	154360	No, he's riding a train wearing a little conductor outfit.
154360	155400	Oh, okay.
155400	155640	Okay.
155640	158480	I thought it might have been from one of the recent cities or something, but that's cool.
158520	158880	Cute.
158960	160240	I don't I don't know.
160240	161320	But he was cute.
161720	163600	And the guy gave me five bucks off.
163840	164320	All right.
164520	165520	Hurray for a deal.
165560	166000	Love it.
166680	167160	All right.
168360	171360	So we're gonna come back and talk more about California stream a little later.
171360	174880	But I also want to introduce the one and only tech master Loki.
175360	175880	Hello.
175920	176640	Hi, Loki.
176640	177440	How are you?
177840	178440	I'm good.
178520	180800	You've had you've had a little bit of a week, haven't you?
180800	182880	Yeah, it doesn't even seem like it's been this week.
182880	187400	So it's like, yeah, it's just, that seems like it's so distant in the past.
187400	192400	Let me let me ask this first off, because I know we're going to talk a little bit about Minecraft, a lot of it about Minecraft here in a minute.
192400	197520	But you've got like another content creator playing there behind you in Minecraft.
197520	198760	What is this all about this video?
198880	207880	Because again, we do tape live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
208040	210720	And when you tune in live, you can see things like visuals.
211200	221880	And Loki's got I'm commenting on this visual because it definitely we're going to talk Minecraft, but I'm curious who this particular content creator is and what its relation is to what we're going to talk about.
222560	223840	So that's major.
225000	232280	Not only do does he participate in MCC, but he also runs it.
232560	243640	So this is his his VOD from the last they call it Canon MCC where the actual players that are invited to MCC on a regular basis play.
243640	245200	So it's MCC 33.
245600	248480	And they believe they were the aqua axolotls.
248480	257880	That's probably probably wrong now that I think of it, but it was the one the first episode where Etho was in there and stuff.
257880	263960	It said it's supposed to be recommended watching for me because it gives me an idea of how all the games are played.
264360	278400	But this is let's talk about the relevance of that real quick here and talking about this whole Minecraft championships, because let's see, I seem to remember a couple of weeks ago on the show, you came on here and you said, Oh, yeah, you know, really, you know, you've had this group that you've been working
278400	283400	with for a while, this channel 64 and your Minecraft creation, which you really got into in the last couple of years.
283400	286760	And everybody, I would hope at this point knows about your YouTube channel.
286760	301160	But if for some reason they don't Loki or on YouTube, you've got these awesome Minecraft videos, these big builds, these mega man inspired gigantic builds that one day minecraft.net will finally recognize one of these two
302160	303840	that ship has sailed there.
303840	306280	They've already moved on to like with SpongeBob or something.
307320	308160	No, that's turtles.
308360	309480	Ninja Turtles is a new one.
309480	310800	Yeah, we love Ninja Turtles.
310800	312360	At least Tiger Claw loves Ninja Turtles.
312360	318840	Anyway, so a couple weeks on the show, you said, Oh, yeah, my team were applying to this Minecraft championship thing is like a really big deal.
318920	323360	But like all these people apply and like there's there's no chance in hell that we're going to get in.
323520	324800	We're not going to get into this.
324800	326880	We're doing it for the experience, the fun and all this stuff.
327040	329280	Loki, do you have any news you'd like to share with us this week?
329600	333360	So apparently there was a chance in hell that we would get into it, and we did.
333400	340360	We are one of 10 teams that will be competing next Saturday in MCC rising to.
340640	346600	So MCC, that stands for Minecraft Creator Championship.
346960	357440	And basically it is it's like I guess it's sort of like the Olympics or like Super Bowl of Minecraft in like minigames and stuff.
357440	363040	So they have a bunch of different games, everything from like parkour to
364520	365640	there's like a game.
365640	367640	It's like Mario Kart almost.
367640	368720	It's called Ace Race.
368720	370240	It's pretty fun.
371040	376680	PVP stuff, survival stuff, there's puzzles, there's a lot of teamwork things.
376720	380400	So it's like Mario Party in Minecraft for a ton of people.
380400	382280	Sort of, kind of.
382280	385720	Yeah, it's but it's basically there's like
386200	388040	I think it's like eight different games.
388040	390520	So the games are going to get announced later this week
391600	392840	because they just hint at it.
392840	395560	You know what you're going to be playing and then.
397680	400760	Then, yeah, Saturday, it's going to be at least like four hours,
401960	406480	four to five hours of streaming as we, you know, play.
406480	408560	So we're the orange ocelots.
408560	410480	I like the fact that we got orange.
410480	411320	And that was right.
411320	412280	You didn't ask for colors.
412280	415240	Well, they tried to assign everybody
415240	418800	the color of the team that they applied with.
418800	420640	So we were the Crimson cast members.
420640	422880	And so there was already another red team.
422880	424920	They're like, well, orange was the closest thing we had.
424920	426840	So we put you in order to play.
426840	427720	That's fine.
427720	428840	It was meant to be.
428840	433000	We only did Crimson cast members because it rhymed with CNC.
433000	434640	So that was about it.
434640	437600	But yeah, it's been
437600	440600	big, crazy and extremely stressful for sure, because,
441000	442640	you know, they're one of the teams.
442640	445600	I mean, like honestly, like I going into it,
445800	448880	I'm not great at like competitive Minecraft stuff.
448880	450080	I build stuff.
450080	453200	I play around with friends and stuff and I can edit videos
453520	456320	and I'm doing that stuff pretty regular.
456560	459720	There's another team that all they do is grind MCC Island stuff.
459720	462600	So of course, they're going to come in and just dominate everything.
462800	467280	But that's not really what MCC is about, though, too, because in the canon MCC,
467720	470720	you have content creators like there are people from hermitcraft.
470720	474120	There's quite a few of them actually participate in MCC
474400	478480	and they're not like PvP gods or parkour gods at all.
478480	482120	I mean, it's just kind of just participating and having fun with it.
482120	486600	And so I was stressing this myself out way too much about everything,
486600	489120	because, you know, I'm like, oh, man, I'm going to be terrible.
489120	491040	I don't want to get last place.
491040	493920	Like I just this is going to be horrible.
493920	495280	Everyone's expecting us to do well.
496240	498360	This is not going to go well at all.
498360	499640	I mean, it's fine.
499640	501680	There's a little bit there's a little bit of that as well.
501680	504400	But like you got there's 40 content creators in this thing.
504520	506720	At least 20 of them have to be feeling how you feel.
506720	509360	Yeah. And there's it's not it's all varying sizes.
509360	512480	So like our team, you know, we have content creators are all about,
512480	516080	you know, a thousand subs, 1500 subs and under.
516800	519160	There's another team that's kind of like that as well.
519200	523760	There's some that have, you know, 50,000 subs or 100,000 subs.
523760	525680	So it's varying sizes.
525680	531040	And it it was up to us major and not crew folks that put on the event
531040	535800	to decide who they felt were going to be the most entertaining to watch.
535800	537920	And so thankfully, they picked us.
537920	540240	They liked our video, your little intro video.
540240	541480	And it is over on Twitter.
541480	544960	And I saw it on your Twitter over at Loki or it was really funny.
544960	547760	Like, I don't even like I don't follow the Minecraft memes and all that.
547760	549680	But it was it was easy enough for me to follow.
549680	552600	And like, obviously, you made like a really funny age joke about it,
552600	554320	about why you do the content creation.
554320	557720	Like, I'm so old and I'm so lonely and I laughed. It's good.
557960	560840	So and that's that's the thing to do is that like,
560840	564480	if you feel like you're flopping or whatever, just make it funny.
564640	567560	Like that's exactly that's all you have to make it funny.
567680	571920	And it doesn't matter if your last place my last place hilariously.
572200	577000	Well, the thing is, like I know in context, I decided like, OK, well,
577680	580360	you know, I'm like really stressing myself out about it,
580360	583920	like trying to get like really good stuff because I'm not good at parkour.
583920	586480	I tried a race stuff on the practice server.
587480	589600	I'm all right at it.
589600	592920	But like there's a lot of people that are taking it way more seriously than that.
592920	594880	But at the same time, like, well, wait a second.
594880	598160	Like, you know, people that I watch, like on Hermitcraft and stuff,
598160	600200	I'm like, where are they placing on these MCCs?
600200	603280	And lo and behold, they're in the bottom 25 percent as well.
603280	605200	So I'm like, OK, I don't feel as bad anymore.
605200	608880	Like this is this is the the level of skill that
609320	612080	a content creator similar to myself would have.
612080	615520	I'm like, OK, that's like a load off a bit still stressful
615520	617360	because I still want to be entertaining and stuff.
617360	619520	Yeah, and I don't stream nearly enough. But
621160	625000	this week, a lot, you know, I have the whole week off to
626040	627280	well, a lot of things.
627280	631080	So we just started our season three of our Channel 64.
631080	633440	So that was something that we've been doing this weekend.
633880	637920	I'm still editing my finale for season two, which is ridiculously complex.
638520	639960	It's like a it's like a movie.
639960	644520	It's just ridiculous what so that'll come out hopefully this week.
645360	647960	Maybe next week, I'm trying to get it out sooner than later
647960	650280	because, you know, people are going to be having season three videos out
650280	653400	and that's going to be ridiculous. I'm the last one.
653400	656120	And then, of course, MCC rising
656120	658400	training stream. So we're going to be doing a lot of that this week.
658440	662960	We have an interview with one of the MCC channels tomorrow.
663240	665040	So that'll be fun.
665040	666720	We've got fan art.
666720	669280	I was going to say, I've never gotten fan art before.
669480	672400	So so looking at our chat over at twitch.tv, such a VOG network
673000	675600	where we do tape live on Sunday nights.
675600	679120	S2100 Matt is asking, I'm sure your subs and follows have jumped
679120	680240	since this happened.
680240	682000	Not by a lot.
682000	684840	It did appear to well, it did appear to me looking at social media
684840	687920	that, you know, there were a lot of people like I know you'd said
687920	690720	on the show a couple of weeks ago, this is kind of a big deal.
690880	694240	But of course, I don't follow Minecraft that community as closely.
694240	696720	I was kind of like, oh, well, I, you know, a big deal
696720	698400	is kind of a relative thing, right?
698400	699560	It's what's important to you.
699560	703200	But then I was noticing in like the replies to like your application video
703200	706320	that had been posted, there's that like a lot of people seemed to.
706320	709120	Yeah. And then I saw the fan art thing as well and all that.
709120	712960	So I was like, dang, this thing definitely has its fans and people.
712960	717480	People get into it like it's a sports like it's the Olympics, basically.
717480	720560	You know, yeah, there's been like like I was looking at my sub count.
720560	723840	So I've gained like 30 subs since Wednesday, which is that's
723840	726440	pretty good. I take 30 subs for the network.
726440	729080	YouTube to say, you know, I'll take it.
729120	733360	Like, honestly, I'm not I'm not like only 30, you know, whatever. That's fine.
733920	738120	But the whole point was to just get our names out there.
738120	741160	So now there's people that a lot of people like, especially when the
741960	744280	reveals of the teams came out, they're like,
745160	746760	we don't know who these people are.
746760	750680	Yeah, and that's not necessarily us, but like a lot of different creators
750680	752800	are like, I've never heard of these creators before.
752800	754560	I'm going to go check them out.
754560	756640	So that's kind of cool.
757440	760000	I'm still trying to leverage this into getting noticed
760000	762560	by more people from Hermitcraft and others.
762560	766320	So like one of our coaches is this guy goes by named Cubfan,
766640	768240	who is one of the hermits as well.
768240	772480	So I'm going to try to convince the coaches this week.
773120	774280	We'll see how that goes.
774280	778520	But like, yeah, it's just it's fun just to get to meet
778520	781320	some of these people and stuff, and the teams have been really cool.
783360	786400	Yeah, I mean, I hope I hope it works out, because like, I know
786400	790120	a lot of like the people that have been in like MCC rising in the past, like,
791600	795320	you know, their channels do eventually do better later on.
795320	797160	But like, I don't know, I don't think it's going to like,
797160	798920	we're not going to just jump all of a sudden, like,
798920	802040	I'm not going to have like 100,000 subs in a month or something like that.
802040	803840	I think I think the right way you're looking at it
803840	807000	is like the potential collaborations in the future and getting to know
807000	810280	other people and, you know, working on, you know, it's just like
810280	812480	kind of like how you ended up with this group you're with now.
812480	814240	You didn't start with the intent to do that.
814240	816680	You just networked among other smaller content creators
816680	818640	and now found yourself where you are.
818640	822400	And now look at what you've accomplished together in this giant Olympic thing.
822400	824560	So it only goes up from there, right?
824880	825840	Yeah, hopefully. Yeah.
825840	829560	So so yeah, next week, next week, it's going to be Saturday
829840	832600	at 12 Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.
834520	839440	Yeah. Come come watch me compete in the MCC championships
839440	842680	and our MCC championships.
842680	844240	It's going to be nuts.
844240	845440	I can't wait.
845440	846640	Here's the hard part, too, about it.
846640	849760	Like, see, it's so on our practice server and stuff like they have
849760	853640	some of the games, but like at least half of the games you can't practice.
854000	855440	You just go into it.
855440	858720	You got to you have to watch some videos, figure out how it's played
858720	860840	and good luck.
860840	863000	So it'll it'll be fun.
863000	865360	All right. Well, good luck to you.
865360	866880	Can't wait to see on Saturday.
866880	870320	We'll be spamming those links all over socials as we root you on
870320	872640	and the orange ocelots.
872640	875680	All right. Well, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight
875680	877320	and then we'll get into our gaming weeks, of course.
877320	879840	But first, let's talk about some of the big news in gaming.
880080	884640	And I guess appropriate for Minecraft, because this was one of the biggest games
884640	885800	that we saw on.
885800	888120	Obviously, this game has evolved a lot, a lot, a lot since then.
888120	891440	But let's talk a little bit about one of its very first platforms,
891440	896240	the Xbox 360 and the big news that came out about that this week.
896240	897840	Look, you want to start us off here.
897840	903080	Yeah. So basically, Microsoft is shutting down the Xbox 360 marketplace,
903080	905560	which makes sense because we're talking like a console
905560	907800	that's two generations old at this point.
907800	911200	But, you know, they are giving you a little bit of a head's notice.
911200	915200	So July 29, 2024 is when that's going to be going down.
915360	919800	At that time, you just won't be able to purchase new games for the Xbox 360.
920200	923800	So if you're looking to get some digital games on the 360,
924200	926720	you got a year to do it.
926720	929640	And then after that, they said this change will not affect your ability
929640	933280	to play Xbox 360 games or DLC you've already purchased.
933480	937240	It's just purchasing new things, which I mean, yeah,
937240	939600	eventually you got to shut down those storefronts.
940280	943440	It's, you know, 18 years old as the console here.
943480	947480	I mean, it's just it's bound to happen at some point.
947480	950720	So it's one of those things where it's like it is the end of an era.
950760	953840	But at the same time, it's like, dang, like, especially when,
953840	957440	you know, it's coming off of the news that like Nintendo shut down the Wii U store
957680	961480	not that long ago, and the Wii U was certainly a newer system
961480	964960	than the Xbox 360 to go for 18 years is a long time.
964960	969360	And what I think is particularly notable about this is especially,
969360	971720	you know, again, in contrast to something like Nintendo
971720	976280	that recently shut a storefront down, is that really this is just about
976280	980040	actually buying things on an actual Xbox 360.
980160	981760	And that's just buying new things.
981760	985000	It has nothing to do with redownloading things you already bought.
985000	987360	You can do that or DLC that you already buy. You can do that.
987840	991240	If you want to buy Xbox 360 games on your Xbox
991240	995640	one or your Xbox Series X, S, et cetera, you can still do that.
996040	1000480	Now, of course, not every Xbox 360 game is playable.
1000720	1004240	They didn't get backwards compatibility for everything or licensing updates
1004240	1005960	or what have you for everything.
1006000	1008560	But that's still a really big chunk of games
1008560	1010920	that isn't going away from all of this.
1010920	1014680	Again, in contrast to what we've seen other storefronts do,
1014680	1017640	I'd almost argue that Microsoft is doing this the way
1017880	1021800	I think we wish other consoles would sunset.
1021800	1024320	You know, maybe Microsoft has that advantage of that.
1024520	1027960	They still have this huge infrastructure because they are Windows,
1028240	1030520	you know, essentially at the end of the day.
1030520	1033840	You know, so they have the server capacity and all that to do this.
1034840	1039040	But, you know, now it does affect like if you own movies and things like that.
1039200	1041520	I believe that's the one kind of interesting thing,
1041520	1045920	because I remember you could get TV shows on Xbox 360 and play them that way.
1046560	1051200	I remember Heroes, the TV show, you could get that on Xbox 360.
1051520	1055040	And I think I own an episode or two because that's how I watched it,
1055040	1056760	how I watched an episode that I missed.
1057080	1061080	So I would not be able to watch those anymore on my Xbox 360.
1061080	1062360	That is something that's going away.
1062840	1064880	Again, I believe it's licensing, et cetera, et cetera.
1064880	1068320	But Microsoft is giving you a year's notice
1068920	1072560	that your digital library will still transfer to other systems
1073320	1076960	or a mobile device or, you know, other other things like that.
1076960	1080680	So I do feel like Microsoft is going about this the right way
1080680	1083280	and is kind of setting the model in some ways.
1083480	1085160	Is it perfect?
1085160	1089120	No, but is it about the best we can hope for from a big company like Microsoft?
1089160	1092080	Yeah, I think so. I think so.
1092080	1095960	So. Darkstalker, I don't know if you were raising your hand or what.
1096120	1097880	It's hard to tell with the Vtuber sometimes.
1097880	1101320	I was doing a shrug emoji.
1101400	1104160	Yeah, well, you don't it's not something
1104160	1106280	that really affects you because you weren't a big 360 gamer.
1108160	1111560	We have one, I don't think I've hooked it up in. Yeah.
1113000	1115440	I have to think about it a while.
1115480	1117440	I have one or two Xbox 360.
1117440	1120240	I say one or two because I'm pretty sure Alan had one when we,
1120240	1121680	you know, consolidated our lives.
1121680	1122560	So I think we have two.
1122560	1125080	But I couldn't tell you the last time we turned that on.
1125080	1129320	I mean, I do miss things that you can't play backwards compatible,
1129320	1133400	like DDR Universe is a great example for music game fans,
1134120	1135840	you know, because DDR
1135840	1138320	Ultramix already went away with the original Xbox.
1138560	1141960	So DDR Universe is going to be going away essentially.
1141960	1144680	But, you know, at the same time, it's like.
1146080	1151040	It's if you own the disk, you could still play it on an actual 360.
1151040	1152880	Nobody's taking that away.
1152880	1156840	So, yeah, it's it's it's just the digital storefront
1157200	1159000	and some of the movie TV stuff.
1159000	1163440	So as Joe 100 Matt in chat says, RIP the original TV sports, TV sports.
1163480	1165120	Yes, all of that.
1165120	1168000	Bobby Blackwell also confirming I own a couple of specific
1168000	1170000	episodes of TV shows on the Microsoft Store.
1170280	1173720	I just remember they they used to give away the Guild on their team.
1173720	1176120	Remember that old Felicia Day short thing, the Guild?
1176160	1177480	Yeah, that was on there, too.
1177480	1180960	I don't know if that's considered TV show or if that was like a different thing.
1180960	1184280	I don't know how they because you used to be web series originally.
1184280	1188440	Yeah, you used to be able to watch movie trailers on 360 as well, I'm pretty sure.
1188440	1191520	So I'm not sure if those just all kind of count as TV shows or what.
1191520	1194680	But at this point, when YouTube isn't,
1194960	1197960	you know, it's like you can kind of go find what you need to find. Right.
1199640	1201240	But let's see.
1201240	1204920	Bobby Blackwell says I have one and it's in my office, but it's not hooked up
1205160	1209440	because this old TV only has one HDMI port.
1209840	1212840	So anyway, in one year's time,
1212840	1216480	we will be saying rest in peace to the Xbox 360 storefront.
1216480	1219480	But the Xbox 360 as a device lives on.
1219760	1224280	You can still see an Xbox 360 at California Extreme in 20 years,
1224280	1226560	and it will still be able to play things like DDR universe.
1226640	1228480	There wasn't one this year.
1228480	1230320	Well, it might not be old enough yet,
1230320	1233400	but at some point it'll be at some point it'll be a museum.
1234800	1237800	In the end, nothing lasts. Yep.
1238760	1241520	As Joe and Matt says, I miss afterburner climax.
1241560	1245760	It got delisted a bit, but it was never made backward compatible past 360.
1245760	1248000	Probably because the backwards compatibility or because the delisting,
1248000	1250560	excuse me, I'm sure I'll have to spend 50 dollars for it
1250560	1252680	as part of a Sega collection Sunday.
1252680	1255880	Bobby Blackwell also pointing out another great element of this news
1255880	1260160	is that 360 multiplayer games will still work. Yes. Yeah, that's good.
1260160	1262240	And again, that's probably. Yeah.
1262240	1266920	A plus of it being tied into the greater windows
1266920	1269880	and, you know, everything that Microsoft does with that, because.
1272400	1276680	You know, when they pulled the plug on the Nintendo storefronts that.
1278960	1281720	Though you couldn't even play the Nintendo games online anymore,
1281720	1284080	like the whole Nintendo online service went down.
1284080	1287440	So I think that's really cool that they're keeping that intact.
1289320	1292040	Yeah. Bobby says this is literally just them shutting down
1292040	1294760	the financial aspect and the video DRM aspect.
1294760	1296440	Pretty much. Pretty much so.
1296440	1299960	Yeah. And a whole year's notice,
1299960	1303240	which I want to say is longer than we got with some of the Nintendo news.
1303240	1304400	I keep picking on Nintendo.
1304400	1305960	It's not like other platforms haven't done this,
1305960	1309440	but in the day and age that we live in, we're more and more. What's that?
1310040	1312360	I thought it's just so easy. Yeah. Yeah.
1313120	1315120	As more and more platforms go digital,
1315120	1318440	this is just something we're going to talk about more and more for sure. So.
1319440	1322760	All right. Like it's like we may as well just accept the inevitable.
1323080	1325840	Yeah, right. Yeah.
1325840	1329560	All right. Well, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks, of course,
1329560	1331960	in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week,
1331960	1335080	where we talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1335440	1337760	So Dark Soccer, I'm sure you had a busy weekend.
1337760	1339320	How was your gaming week?
1339320	1341760	So I went to California Xtreme yesterday
1342960	1345480	and we stayed for a while.
1345480	1350720	It's 60 fucking bucks to park because there was a 49ers game.
1350720	1352760	Oh, bar. Oh, that's awful.
1352760	1355080	That's that's right. I forgot that it's in Santa Clara now.
1356080	1357320	It was ridiculous.
1357320	1360080	Exploitive, exploitative, whatever they call it. It's just horrible.
1360880	1363960	Yeah, well, it was we ended up, though.
1363960	1366600	I mean, Dan parked and I had brought like a
1367720	1371040	an ice cooler with like snacks for on the way and a couple of drinks.
1371040	1374640	So I mean, we it wasn't like we spent a whole lot inside the con.
1376280	1379120	But it was very eventful.
1379520	1381600	I did Reninda Melody once.
1382600	1386440	Who has the best T-shirt living my OK-est life.
1388440	1390440	I ran into Neil.
1390560	1391600	And that was great.
1391600	1393960	We hung out for a little bit.
1393960	1397760	I played a bunch of stuff, like at least I'd say 30
1397920	1400400	30 different games of various varieties.
1400920	1404440	So I will start I'm going to go through this quickly,
1404440	1408600	but there's a few things I want to focus on is so I played.
1409600	1411840	First of all, I did play some stuff in the console room.
1411840	1414560	They had a super graphics hooked up, so I played Aldines,
1414560	1417600	although they had a Daimakai Mura in earlier.
1417600	1420280	And I wished I'd played that instead because it's like one of the best home
1420280	1425920	ports and mega race for the Panasonic 3DO, which is garbage.
1426640	1427760	I love that game.
1427760	1431840	That was my first like CD-ROM game when I had like an external CD-ROM
1431840	1436480	for my PC because it would run on like a single speed or dual speed CD-ROM.
1437040	1440040	You were welcome to keep enjoying that game,
1440040	1444040	and I will just smile and nod and not know it's a bad game.
1444040	1446560	I completely agree, but I liked it at the time.
1446760	1450360	Like I've watched video of it like after the fact, I'm like, wow, that's.
1451400	1453680	Really bad. I played this.
1453680	1456720	Really? And I like the one guy, though, he sort of
1457120	1462680	reminds me of Don Knotts from like Three's Company, like the host. Yeah.
1463080	1464720	Yeah. All right.
1464720	1468800	Well, moving on to the not quite categorizable games.
1468840	1471480	I played Baby Pac-Man, which was great.
1471640	1473160	I love Baby Pac-Man.
1473160	1476160	And they had it as a ticket game,
1476600	1480040	but it's got a pinball element to it called Ticket Tacto.
1481240	1485360	And you've got like a tic tac toe board that lights up
1485360	1490720	as you shoot a ball into one of eight holes.
1490720	1492600	There's a post between each hole.
1492760	1494960	And they're sort of diamond shaped.
1495640	1499240	So the the layout of it, they're they're on more of a curve
1499240	1501760	and you have to shoot up a ramp and land in one of the holes.
1501760	1505720	And then, you know, when you fill them all, you win however many tickets.
1505720	1507920	And it's it's it's a ticket muncher game.
1508320	1511280	But it was enjoyable for, you know, the
1511520	1514520	the 30 seconds I dedicated to it.
1515280	1518160	So I'll go over the pinballs next.
1518160	1522040	So, of course, I played Foo Fighters, which I still love that one.
1522440	1524800	I played Diner.
1524800	1526840	I played Sword of Fury,
1527160	1530360	which is a pretty fun table, if a little frustrating.
1530720	1535720	I played Legends of Valhalla, which is is it one of those Jersey Jack ones?
1536600	1538320	It was it was interesting.
1538320	1540000	Wasn't my favorite.
1541120	1544280	I did get to play one of my favorites, which is Circus Voltaire.
1544960	1547800	That is just an amazing table.
1548360	1550560	And then it was funny.
1550560	1553200	There's also I didn't play any of them because, of course, I owned them.
1554040	1558280	But they had a there's were lined up in this order.
1558280	1561560	They had Black Knight 2000.
1561560	1566640	They had Theater of Magic and a World Cup soccer.
1566920	1570200	If you switch out the Theater of Magic in the Black Knight 2000,
1570200	1572440	that's exactly the same order I have my three in.
1572440	1574840	You know, so it was just funny to me to see them together.
1575440	1577440	And then I played the new venom table.
1577440	1579200	I didn't get to get on a premium.
1580560	1590320	I thought the venom table was a little bit boring,
1590320	1593240	but I figured it was for people who don't like all the thrills
1593560	1595880	and chills of a Circus Voltaire type machine
1595880	1597360	that we're looking at right now on the other screen.
1599320	1601000	Oh, I'm so sorry.
1601000	1602760	God, I'm still having audio issues this week.
1602760	1605560	My bad. You cut out for just a minute when you were talking about the venom table.
1605560	1608440	Go ahead. Oh, well, I thought the venom table,
1608600	1610760	at least the pro was interesting.
1611560	1614600	The premium looked a little bit better.
1614600	1618880	So I didn't get a chance to play it, but I would give it a chance if I saw it.
1620600	1625120	And they also they did have like the the James Bond tables
1625120	1627120	that are themed after different movies.
1627120	1630320	And they had a Godzilla, which we have a Godzilla right now,
1631000	1633080	where I think we did a temp trade for it.
1635080	1637680	And now for the the video games.
1638600	1640800	By the way, one last thing about that venom table
1640800	1643360	is it reminds me very much of Deadpool
1644680	1647760	with the little versus fighting modes and the stuff like that.
1647760	1650080	So if you played the Deadpool table, this is very similar.
1651280	1654080	So now going to the
1654880	1658960	the arcade games I played is I played a sit down Star Wars arcade.
1659480	1662600	I played of course, I had to play Beat Mania three, the final
1663440	1665720	had a lot of fun. I played Pepper 2.
1666720	1669840	I didn't play in foot pedal mode, this is me, my feet hurt.
1670440	1674920	I'm old. They did have some other music games
1674920	1679400	like a sound vortex and, you know, you beat and those things, DDR.
1681320	1684960	I played Pepper 2, which I've never been a big fan of,
1684960	1687560	and I just played it because it was there.
1687560	1690320	I played Nark. Oh, God.
1690880	1693560	And there was this guy behind me, like talking like some big know
1693600	1695920	it all about, you know, this machine, blah, blah, blah.
1695920	1698240	And I said, yeah, and it was in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
1698680	1701000	What? Yeah, the end when they're or the part
1701000	1703160	when they're in the warehouse and they're playing it there at the final boss.
1704120	1705280	Oh, I didn't know that.
1705280	1708280	I'm like, hell yeah, you didn't know that.
1708280	1711640	Anyway, I played Professor Pac-Man.
1713080	1716040	Which is a.
1716040	1718680	When you're tired and you're not seeing things well,
1718680	1723080	then doing a find the reverse of this image is a pain in the ass.
1724040	1726080	Um, of course, I played kicks.
1726280	1728680	I love kicks. I played Dig Dug. I played Strider.
1728680	1730760	I played Bostonian Outrun.
1730760	1733680	It was a stand up Outrun. Super Don Quixote.
1735160	1739040	Sorry, I've never heard of a professor Pac-Man, and I had to go looking it up.
1739080	1741000	This is this. Oh, my gosh.
1741000	1743000	Sorry. Flashing lights warning.
1743000	1744800	Sorry, I didn't know.
1744800	1747520	But that's that's fascinating.
1748560	1751560	And this is another game that I do not know how to pronounce
1751600	1753360	and never have known how to pronounce.
1753360	1756520	And it's it wasn't even super that fun to me.
1756720	1758440	It was like Frogger and Mr.
1758440	1760120	Driller ish a bit.
1760120	1762560	But I'm going to mispronounce this.
1762560	1765640	I'm just going to spell it out. ZZY, ZZYXX.
1765800	1768400	So Ziziks maybe.
1768400	1773120	But it's you have these bricks moving back and forth with little gaps.
1773120	1774840	You have to go up in the gap and move around in the gap
1774840	1776800	and move around in the gap and move around the gap till you hit the top.
1777600	1779720	Yeah, I it was all right.
1780480	1783480	The name was more fun than the game.
1784040	1788320	I'm going to get past a few of these because I'm going to go back to them,
1788320	1791000	but I also played Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp.
1792080	1796080	And I played Xevious and I played Satan's Hollow,
1796680	1799120	which is oh, yeah, I love Satan's Hollow.
1799120	1800600	Yeah, shooting game.
1800600	1803200	And I played a point blank, too.
1804040	1806000	I love point blank.
1806000	1808840	Well, it's so funny because Dan and I have been talking about
1809720	1814400	point blank the other day and how we he wish he hadn't sold
1814400	1817680	all of our gun cons and everything and I was like, well, you know.
1819160	1821840	And so there were some oh, yeah.
1821840	1825240	And the other one I played was an unreleased game called Nightmare in the Dark.
1826480	1828920	But I mean, it's since been it's a complete game.
1828920	1831920	And you might you might hear something about that from me eventually.
1833640	1836360	So there were some indie games there, you know, the same
1836360	1838840	some of the same folks, I think they did Killer Queen.
1839880	1842680	There was a game called Death Ball.
1843600	1847160	A kind of victory where you and another person
1847160	1852000	had to kick a ball across into the opposite person's color,
1852000	1853560	and then it injures them.
1853560	1857000	But you're like if you're on the left and your enemies on the right,
1857000	1860520	your color is facing you on like a center partition
1860800	1864200	and their colors facing them on a second partition.
1864200	1866240	And you have to jump around and do stuff.
1867240	1868520	I only played it once.
1868520	1871480	I wasn't good at it and I didn't particularly enjoy it.
1871480	1872560	But yeah, that's it.
1872560	1875000	And it's it's I mean, there's some people who really love it.
1875000	1876600	For me, I was tired.
1876600	1878560	I was like, I don't want to be competitive.
1880320	1883480	There was another game called Cosmotrons.
1884040	1886320	That's another vectory type of game.
1886520	1888840	In fact, it's very modern vector.
1888840	1893320	And you you only have to
1893560	1897240	you have four buttons and one of them rotates your position.
1897840	1903080	And and then you have like one to keep going up and another to shoot.
1903080	1905880	And it's trying to get these targets on the screen.
1905880	1908160	It's very green vector on black background.
1909920	1911400	It's an interesting little game.
1911400	1913960	I didn't have enough time to really practice it to get good at it.
1914480	1917720	And then there was another one called Black Emperor.
1917960	1922120	And this one's kind of fun for as simple of a concept as it is.
1922520	1926440	It is a sort of endless runner game, but you're on like a motorbike
1926920	1930480	and your goal is to, number one, stay on the road
1930960	1933480	and stay on the center of the road.
1933480	1937120	Like the center of the screen is the best because you can run into obstacles
1937120	1940520	or if you go off the screen at all, then you crash.
1941000	1943080	And it's it's really simple.
1943080	1945680	You have literally, you know,
1946600	1949840	sort of a sliding controller to stay up or down.
1949840	1951800	Another flashy flash game.
1951800	1954640	Sorry, it's like lots of lots of big flashing.
1954640	1957240	Sorry for the folks watching on Twitch.
1957240	1961320	Well, and then you have your accelerator button and, you know, other things.
1961320	1964120	But the game, it's it's.
1965440	1968480	Pretty addictive, but
1968480	1971280	deceptively difficult.
1971280	1973120	And I mean, and see the whole point,
1973120	1975920	you know, if you get off that road or if you get off screen
1975920	1980760	and it is really easy because the the speed of the scrolling alters.
1981400	1987040	So you're having to constantly adjust to maintain that center area,
1987040	1990680	and it's really easy to get knocked off the screen or go too far ahead
1990680	1994160	and run into those barriers like just passed on the screen.
1994360	1996440	It's Desert Bus, Motorcycle Edition.
1997200	1999240	No, no, no, no, no.
1999240	2002000	It's it's more exciting, I think, than Desert Bus.
2002120	2004520	But yeah. So anyway,
2005320	2008120	that was that was pretty much everything I played.
2008120	2009320	You know, there were a bunch of other games.
2009360	2011680	I had a whole bunch of the sit down tables like
2012920	2017520	like they were playing Warlords, you know, in one of the rooms.
2017520	2020200	And I didn't see any of the giant machines, you know,
2020200	2021840	because they used to have like the giant
2024000	2028480	the the ticket Tetris, I guess, or the Space Invaders.
2029920	2033400	And then Dan.
2033400	2038600	Yeah, Dan was playing Warlords, and there was also a the Ferrari F
2038600	2041280	whatever game, the full cab.
2041280	2044120	And and, you know, there were folks, you know,
2044120	2047640	there was the Garage Band, not Garage Band stage, Rock Band.
2048040	2049840	Sorry, I've got Garage Band on the brain.
2049840	2053800	There was the Rock Band stage upstairs, and there was someone.
2054760	2059840	This this girl had to have been like 12, killing it on Heartbreaker.
2060400	2063040	I'm like, holy crap.
2063040	2064880	How do you know this song?
2064880	2067160	You know, and then. Raised right.
2067160	2068920	Like I have clothes older than you.
2071080	2074760	But and I hung out talking with, you know, some of the vendors up there.
2074760	2076800	People selling stuff out of their collections.
2076800	2080680	And I picked up a Pio Pio two remix
2080680	2084440	on Super Famicom to add to my collection of Pio Pio.
2085240	2092200	And and the guy there gave me a cotton CD that went with the rerelease.
2092680	2094560	He just had is like, do you like cotton?
2094560	2096840	I was like, hell, yeah, I like cotton. Here you go.
2096840	2101240	Thanks. And I mean, there was like one artist
2101680	2104440	in the small room and we chatted for a little bit.
2104440	2107760	And I bought I bought some of her merch because her stuff was really cute.
2108360	2111120	And and she does, I think, VTuber work.
2111400	2113200	So it was really cool.
2113200	2115960	And her name was also Jamie.
2115960	2118040	It's spelled differently than mine.
2118640	2121040	But yeah, I mean, the whole thing was was pretty nice.
2121040	2125080	And then there was a movie is like, I think,
2125080	2130240	the the person that saved pinball and did said it was a really good movie.
2130240	2131880	And I kind of wish I'd gone to watch it.
2131880	2135320	But at the same time, you know, it was nice being off on my own
2135320	2138240	and doing my own thing for a little bit because I wouldn't run into melody
2138240	2143480	otherwise. Yeah, yeah, that was that was it.
2143960	2145400	It was a really good time.
2145400	2148400	I played and of course, for the other stuff I played, I played Dead by Daylight.
2149200	2154320	I played I played Disney Dreamlight Valley.
2155320	2157840	And Weird Al.
2157840	2159760	At home, but speaking of Dead by Daylight,
2159760	2163200	you're you're on a little bit of a streaming break for a moment, right?
2163200	2164960	I think I was seeing not on purpose.
2164960	2165720	Yeah, just because.
2165720	2168880	Well, yeah, just because the stuff going on in your professional life.
2168920	2171920	Yeah, I put myself on a vacation because I'm in training
2171920	2174440	at work for something I don't really want to do.
2176920	2179080	And it's going to have me basically
2179080	2182080	getting up at like five thirty in the morning because I start at seven.
2183040	2183960	So I'm going to be working
2183960	2186840	like an eight day a week schedule instead of my usual four by ten.
2188240	2191880	So while I put myself on official vacation,
2192280	2195080	it doesn't mean I'm not going to be doing some streaming.
2195920	2200840	Gotcha. So like I'm going to be on Tuesday for some Dead by Daylight.
2200840	2202120	You know, I'm not going to go without.
2202120	2206240	And I might play, you know, might log in to play Dreamlight Valley
2206240	2210560	or check out the I think there's some new content for Cult of the Lamb.
2211520	2213080	So we'll see.
2213080	2217360	I mean, I'm not going to be not streaming, but I'm not going to be on any kind
2217360	2220000	of official schedule until
2221360	2224280	the first Saturday in September.
2224600	2227040	OK, but that's the second, I believe.
2227280	2228520	Yeah, which is funny.
2228520	2232360	That's also the day after mine and the spouses
2232920	2235320	18th anniversary.
2236200	2240040	Cute. And the day before an episode, we won't be here
2240080	2242160	because I'll be out in Atlanta Labor Day weekend.
2242160	2245200	So more streaming.
2245200	2248000	Well, yeah, I guess I could do that or maybe maybe I'll sneak.
2248320	2250760	Maybe we'll get the cons one of the consoles hooked up
2251240	2253560	and play something together.
2253560	2254640	Who knows? There you go.
2254640	2257160	Maybe some Burning Rangers might happen.
2257160	2259560	All right. Well, let's move on to Loki.
2259600	2263800	I feel like we probably talked about a lot about your week in the earlier chat.
2263800	2266160	But let me check in anyway. How was your gaming week, Loki?
2266160	2268840	It was mostly editing, actually.
2268840	2273120	I've been trying to edit my final episode put together and all that stuff
2273120	2276840	and doing some edits and just,
2277240	2279320	you know, a lot of video editing stuff.
2279800	2283840	Minecraft wise, I did play on MCC,
2284760	2289480	the practice server for a bit, and I was getting slightly better at Ace Race.
2290080	2294400	That is until, you know, the trainers came in
2294400	2296240	and then they decided to blow all the records away.
2296240	2301040	But I got my time under three thirty, which was pretty decent,
2301040	2304080	considering that when I had started like 30 minutes before that,
2304080	2305680	I was at eight minutes.
2305680	2309320	So I'm still having trouble with
2310720	2313600	the I bet there's some people that won't practice at all.
2314800	2316120	I mean, there's people there.
2316120	2318600	There's people that just all they're doing is grinding times on that.
2318600	2322400	In fact, my my teammate is doing that right now.
2322400	2324960	Or I think he was. They were doing that.
2325840	2327240	You know, a little bit ago.
2327240	2330840	So, yeah, they've been grinding times on that for whatever reason.
2330840	2334280	But we've been playing some of the different games like they have
2335040	2337400	parkour tag and
2338800	2341520	dodge bolt, which I don't know why we're playing that,
2341520	2343640	because that's for the top two teams and.
2344680	2347040	We're not going to get the top two
2347680	2349760	and what else a hole in the wall.
2349760	2351240	Hole in the wall is fun.
2351240	2352640	I found a way to cheese that game.
2352640	2355000	I was able to actually get under some of the
2356240	2358960	the walls. It doesn't work all the time, though. And then.
2360880	2364080	Was it the park or a rocket
2364080	2366240	Spleef rocket, Spleef Rush is pretty fun.
2366480	2367800	We actually did get to.
2367800	2372760	So two weeks ago when we were not announcing anything yet,
2373560	2377280	we did get to go on to the actual MCC server,
2377280	2378600	like the one that the event's going to be on.
2378600	2381320	So we we get to play Ace Race.
2381320	2385640	Of course, in that I came in dead last because I have the habit of using
2386320	2388280	pushing forward twice to sprint.
2388280	2389120	You cannot do that.
2389120	2392080	That is not a good way to keep sprinting.
2392080	2393560	So now I've fixed that.
2393560	2396880	And then we also played rocket Spleef Rush, which was fun.
2397200	2398520	Basically, you have a rocket launcher
2398520	2401080	and you have to keep yourself up in the air without falling into the void.
2401080	2403120	And then other people can like knock you off things.
2403120	2405480	And it's a lot of fun.
2406560	2408880	But yeah, it was just fun just to get to walk around that
2408920	2411240	that server and everything and just see everything.
2411440	2414240	They've got a memorial to Technoblade there, which is pretty cool
2414240	2416720	because he participated in a lot of different events.
2418080	2420280	Yeah, it's just I'm very excited to see what happens.
2420280	2422560	I don't know what to expect yet.
2423040	2423960	The games look fun.
2423960	2426840	Like there's a game called Sands of Time where
2427680	2429440	you basically have to go through all these different vaults.
2429440	2433280	It's like a like an ancient Egyptian tomb, I guess.
2433320	2435600	You have to go through all these vaults and like there's different puzzles
2435600	2438960	and parkour and enemies, you have to fight and stuff
2438960	2441760	and you have to keep collecting sand so that it doesn't run out.
2441760	2445960	You have a big sand timer and you have to get out of the vault
2445960	2450280	with all your coins or as many coins as you can is the aim of the game.
2450920	2452160	So that looks like fun.
2452160	2455520	I'm hoping there's one that they've got, which I probably like this.
2455520	2458800	So it's what's it called? It's.
2461120	2463600	It's it's a building game, you have to build
2463840	2466640	basically something that they have built already,
2466800	2470840	but you have to go find the pieces of that build in like a shopping mall
2470840	2472120	or like a supermarket.
2472120	2473800	It's almost supermarket sweep.
2473800	2476600	OK, that sounds fun.
2476920	2478440	So that that looks like a lot of fun.
2478440	2481920	And then there's Grid Wars, which is another one, which is puzzle rooms
2481920	2483960	that you go into and you have to do different things like,
2484200	2488840	you know, get a minecart from one side to another or shoot targets on a wall
2488840	2493640	or solve word puzzles, solve different other puzzles in there.
2493680	2495640	And they have like survival games and stuff like that.
2495640	2497640	So there's a lot of interesting things.
2497640	2499200	I think we're have a lot of fun with it.
2499200	2503480	But yeah, so that and then getting my season three stuff
2504760	2506040	started on Channel 64.
2506040	2508120	So I had all the server maintenance stuff I was doing with that.
2508840	2513160	I did end up playing two days worth of season three.
2513160	2516040	I've already got my iron farm and build your breeder and all that stuff.
2516280	2517080	Still trying to figure out
2517080	2519240	what I'm going to even film for a first episode yet.
2519640	2522120	So it's fun.
2522120	2524800	Lots of it's nice to get to see all the new people
2524800	2526480	that are going to join the server this season.
2526480	2530280	So a lot of fresh new faces that are been around
2530280	2532440	while in our discord for a while.
2532440	2534240	And I'm very excited to play with them.
2534240	2537440	So, yeah, just the whole season and a lot, lot going on.
2537440	2539280	I really want to pass this week.
2539280	2541320	It's going to be a lot less stressful, that's for sure.
2542480	2544400	I'm sure you're going to do great again.
2544440	2545840	If you don't do great, make it funny.
2545840	2546560	It'll be fine.
2546560	2549800	We're going to make it funny, regardless of whether we do great or not.
2549960	2551200	All right. Awesome.
2551200	2554200	And for the life folks, sorry, I keep looking at my phone.
2554640	2557960	I'm getting updates from my sister who is in Long Beach, as I'm sure
2557960	2560320	you know, Southern California is getting hit with a hurricane.
2560560	2562600	Well, I guess tropical storm at this point.
2562600	2566400	But point being, the last time California was hit with one of those
2566680	2568400	was in the 1930s.
2568400	2572720	So, you know, California covers not built for that type of thing.
2572720	2574680	So no. Yeah.
2574680	2579200	My friend or my sister is in Long Beach and just sent me like the
2580040	2583160	I guess she has like a bamboo thing outside that just completely is
2583320	2584680	because, of course, it's all messed up now.
2584680	2586040	It's like made out of bamboo.
2586040	2589280	So, yeah, and as Rama points out in chat, then an earthquake happens.
2589280	2593600	So we definitely had the earthquake of 2023, by the way,
2593600	2595400	because it did come up in Discord.
2595400	2599000	We're nowhere near that, even though we're also in California is nowhere.
2599120	2601040	We're not even expected to get rain in the forecast.
2601040	2602680	It's cloudy outside and that's it.
2602680	2608120	So and I used my favorite graphic in our Discord over at vognetwork.com
2608120	2611280	slash Discord, which shows California, but it shows it on the East Coast.
2611640	2614960	So I was able to say, OK, the hurricane is hitting North Carolina
2615120	2618720	and we live near we live in Pennsylvania near the border of New York.
2618920	2621040	So we're not we're not anywhere near that.
2621040	2623680	But obviously, lots of people we know are
2624480	2626320	and including folks who listen to this show.
2626320	2628720	So I hope everyone is doing OK.
2629200	2631680	And part of the storm system is heading in toward Nevada.
2631720	2634280	So it's actually doing a big circle.
2634280	2637720	Yeah, yeah. And and I mean, it is so funny.
2638000	2641120	My mom's like, you warn him about the bread famine.
2642440	2645920	What I was like, I'm curious to see if the bread famine actually happens.
2646160	2648800	OK, there is a southern phenomenon when a hurricane hits.
2649120	2651600	Well, there's two. There's, of course, the Waffle House index.
2651840	2653840	Yeah. Yeah, that I know about.
2653840	2658200	The other one is that if you were a little bit late going to the grocery store.
2659200	2661200	All that's left are hot dog buns.
2663120	2665640	Only hot dog buns.
2667040	2670720	Only and Bobby is right about about.
2671120	2673400	Yep. The milk, milk toast.
2673680	2675760	Yep. Milk and bread, milk and bread.
2675760	2678280	But the big thing is that the only thing left is hot dog buns.
2678560	2681920	If you're bread, man, my kids would be so stoked about that.
2681920	2682640	That's all they eat.
2682640	2685560	I mean, people panic by here, too, for big storms.
2685600	2687800	It's I don't know if it's that same thing.
2687800	2689640	But yeah. Yeah.
2689640	2693080	Even like when we get like a lot of rain, everyone just like buying out everything.
2693120	2695800	I was gonna say we had storms of 70 mile an hour winds over the winter.
2695960	2698280	We just didn't call them hurricanes because they weren't, you know,
2698280	2700640	the right because they weren't the right formation.
2700640	2702800	But they still had very strong winds.
2702800	2705120	But like my mom's like,
2706280	2708640	is it going to be a straight line or a swerve?
2709400	2710400	The swerve. All right.
2710400	2712520	Y'all are OK. Mm hmm.
2712520	2716320	Because I mean, that's the thing is that when you grow up, when there's hurricanes,
2716800	2718840	you're just sort of like, oh, OK, this again.
2719040	2722640	I mean, even though, yeah, the really big ones can be scary.
2722640	2726320	You know, the thing is that you prepare for them all pretty much the same way.
2727520	2733000	You have you fill your your tub with water and put a cap full of bleach in it.
2735040	2738280	So that you have clean drinking water, even if it's nasty.
2739880	2743080	You know, basically just disinfected water to have.
2743400	2748520	I guess modern day, you don't really need to tape up your windows,
2748520	2751880	but when I was a kid, you always, you know, duct taped your windows
2751880	2754880	so that if they broke, they wouldn't shatter. Right.
2756320	2760200	You know, just you stock up on food, you stock up on toilet paper,
2760200	2762800	you make sure that you've done all your laundry.
2762800	2764960	You make sure you've got coolers.
2764960	2767240	If you're lucky, you have a gas generator.
2767240	2769440	My uncle has a couple of them.
2769480	2773760	But the thing also is that houses back
2773760	2777120	where I'm from are built out of concrete.
2777280	2779920	Yeah. And metal. Yeah. And brick.
2780880	2784640	And houses out here are not are built out of plywood. Yeah.
2785800	2789120	They're built more for earthquake stuff than they are hurricane stuff.
2789120	2793360	So if that I don't know, I've seen some rickety construction.
2793360	2796960	I mean, honestly, I don't know that a plywood building like what we have here
2797640	2799280	has the right kind of foundation
2799280	2802000	for a lot of developments to withstand an earthquake.
2802000	2804080	I mean, here in Sacramento, it's not bad. We don't really get them.
2804560	2806400	But I don't know.
2806400	2808320	Wait, wait, let me get to my gaming week.
2808320	2810680	Talk about weather. No, it's fine. Sorry.
2810680	2813920	But with my gaming week, I want to talk about just
2814400	2816520	honestly, I didn't really play anything new, new.
2816520	2817800	I did play some theater rhythm,
2817800	2820400	which I had streamed a little bit because I was behind on DLC.
2820600	2821600	So I'm finally caught up.
2821600	2825200	I've played every song once still in the game, hundreds of songs.
2826000	2827040	So that's good.
2827040	2831360	And Diablo four, still my seasonal character has finally caught up
2831360	2835520	to my forever character by hitting level 61 today.
2836080	2837240	So still working on that.
2837240	2840680	And then I've actually been playing a bit more Overwatch two randomly.
2840920	2843040	I have a couple of friend groups that are super into it.
2843040	2845160	They keep trying to get me to play. So I'm like, OK.
2845160	2848760	And I'm finding like, oh, I'm maybe like I don't think I'm good at it,
2848760	2850920	but like I'm like, OK, maybe I'm not bad at it.
2850920	2854360	Like I thought like I was actually the thing about Overwatch
2854400	2856200	that I do know how to do
2856200	2860200	is I know how to change my hero to respond to the situation
2860400	2865040	that if the character I'm using is not working, I know to change to somebody else.
2865040	2869200	Like if we are having a really hard time picking off healers and I'm on DPS
2869200	2872320	and you know, maybe I'm Farah or somebody is just having a hard time,
2872560	2875840	you know, well, Farah can sometimes hit the back line depending on the map.
2875840	2878600	But like, I should switch to Widowmaker.
2878600	2882240	And yes, I actually play Widowmaker and I do pretty decent with her.
2882240	2884960	But I also know to switch the fuck off of her
2884960	2887800	if there's a Sombra or somebody that counters are real, real easy.
2887800	2893080	So yeah, like that's that's my biggest asset is I don't stick to one hero hero.
2893080	2894800	I try to play a variety.
2894800	2895960	So there is that.
2895960	2900280	So I honestly, that was really it for my gaming week.
2900520	2902120	I didn't play a lot of new stuff,
2902120	2903880	but I'm sure that will change in the coming weeks.
2903880	2905840	So. All right.
2905840	2907760	Quickly, before we get into the other news, I do.
2907760	2911760	I do also want to give a plug to our growing YouTube presence over at
2911960	2913920	YouTube VOG Network.
2913920	2915560	That's VOG Network on YouTube.
2915560	2917400	Just posted a couple more videos this week.
2917400	2920160	Last week, Dark Soccer and I talked about the Alien DLC
2920160	2921960	and Shane and I talked about Fan Fest.
2921960	2925960	Shane and I got together again to do a Final Fantasy 16 spoiler chat.
2926160	2927960	So that is available now over on YouTube.
2927960	2929880	If you've beaten the game or you just don't care
2929880	2932360	and you want to hear impressions anyway about the game.
2932360	2937040	And then I spent quite some time this I did a 20 minute video
2937040	2940280	talking about Pokemon Go routes in the game and that feature.
2940320	2941880	But the reason why I talked so long about it
2941880	2945720	is I also related it to a similar thing in Ingress missions.
2945720	2948000	And I kind of talked about the similarities, the differences,
2948000	2950920	and why didn't they just copy paste what they already had
2950920	2952240	and maybe try to get into some of that.
2952240	2954320	So it's a little bit of a deep dive in the feature and all that.
2954320	2956640	And I actually recorded myself doing this.
2956640	2959240	So I'm actually playing the game, but it's obviously time delayed.
2959240	2960560	I'm not out doing it in the real world.
2960560	2962720	But it was stuff I had recorded the day before
2962720	2964560	while I happened to be at the mall,
2964560	2967160	you know, doing a route there to kind of show what that's all about.
2967640	2971000	And I understand Go Fest in that game was happening this weekend.
2971000	2975080	I still don't know if I'm going to buy a ticket to the global one next weekend.
2975080	2980280	I'm not, although I like the routes feature and I like, you know,
2980280	2983760	overall some of Pokemon Go's features and getting out and moving.
2983760	2987400	I don't know if I agree with a lot of the direction the game's taken this year.
2987400	2990920	I still don't think Niantic has properly apologized
2990920	2994160	for what they did with the whole remote raid situation and all that.
2994160	2998560	And I think the best way to express my frustration is to vote my wallet.
2998560	3002920	And I feel like the only thing I don't have that I would get from paying for it
3002920	3006840	would be the new legendary, which whatever you never use those
3007040	3010320	those legendaries from Go Fest, you never actually use them in the game.
3010600	3014760	I think maybe Victini is the only one I ever actually use once in a great while.
3015560	3020120	And then that and M unknown.
3020120	3023560	I don't have an unknown M and I have like at least 15 letters.
3023560	3025560	I don't have M. That's the only one I need.
3025560	3028760	But like, I know I have friends that will play that will get plenty and I can just trade.
3028760	3030240	That's it. Yeah.
3030240	3032160	SG100Matt in chat says, I'm not buying it.
3032160	3033240	Go Fest a bit of dud.
3033240	3035760	And like Rob is saying, not happy with what Niantic has been doing.
3035760	3037360	Yeah, I think I'm going to vote my wallet.
3037360	3038960	I will probably still go out and play.
3038960	3040000	So maybe I'm not helping.
3040000	3043560	Maybe I'm being, you know, but I'll go out and catch shinies.
3043560	3046960	But that's more about me walking and just having incentive to do that
3046960	3049160	and go, you know, around downtown or something.
3049160	3052600	But that's because I kind of want to I want this weekend.
3052600	3059240	I want to do activities that are very like by myself because with Dragon Con coming up,
3059240	3063040	I don't want to catch covid two days before I leave for Dragon Con
3063040	3065400	because then that would be catastrophic
3065400	3069200	and really take away a lot of the awesome opportunities coming my way at Dragon Con this year
3069200	3071280	because I wouldn't be able to go.
3071280	3074640	So I'm going to just kind of keep to myself this next weekend and all that good stuff.
3074640	3080240	I realize, well, if I may, also spending a little bit of time by yourself
3080240	3082480	would be good for a little bit of self centering.
3082480	3084200	Yeah, no, you're around so many people.
3084200	3085040	For sure. For sure.
3085040	3088200	It's charging the batteries before extrovert central, for sure.
3088400	3092000	And then it's like, I know I'm putting myself in a very risky situation,
3092000	3095920	but, you know, I, I have to weigh the pros and cons on stuff.
3095920	3097040	I'll wear a mask.
3097040	3100960	And especially when crossing through the hotels and places like that,
3100960	3103440	just where I know it's going to be.
3103440	3105960	So, you know, try to protect myself that way.
3105960	3108240	But I know what we could do.
3108240	3111520	We could put a gas mask on you and have you walk around going, are you my mommy?
3111520	3114720	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Part of my cosplay out of it's. Yeah.
3114960	3116760	Yeah. An episode of Doctor Who.
3116760	3121880	Yeah. Yeah. Or, you know, cosplaying somebody that was a pandemic.
3122960	3126480	1920s with a big what do you what do they call the big beak masks?
3127560	3128480	Oh, plague doctor.
3128480	3131000	Yeah, like a plague doctor cosplaying a plague doctor.
3131000	3133640	Well, that wasn't the 1920s.
3133640	3135840	Yeah, that was way back when.
3136080	3138240	There's there's a lot about those, though,
3138240	3141000	that that isn't historically accurate, but I digress.
3141360	3143800	All right. Anyway, oh, great.
3143800	3145000	I have one I can lend you.
3145000	3147040	Matt says I have an M unknown.
3147040	3149440	Perfect. Perfect. All right.
3149440	3150320	Let's move on.
3150320	3154360	Let's get into the news this week and we will start with Loki.
3155320	3158840	Yep. So Twitch is actually going to allow us
3158840	3162280	to now block banned users from watching your stream.
3162280	3165400	So apparently you could just, you know, prevent them from actually chatting.
3165400	3167480	But now you can prevent them from actually watching.
3168000	3171360	So they can't harass you in other ways.
3171360	3173520	This is the first on my list.
3173520	3176640	This is supposed to be coming sometime in September.
3177120	3180080	And when you block or ban someone,
3180440	3183680	they'll no longer be able to view your stream, I think by default.
3184520	3186800	So that's that's nice.
3188840	3191800	It doesn't stop people from watching your VODs, though.
3192800	3197920	But it's a starting for your clips, which would be part of your VODs, right?
3199440	3201840	I mean, I'm kind of surprised this feature wasn't already in there,
3202080	3205560	but like, wouldn't all you have to do is log out and you could still see it
3205560	3208440	like that's that's what you can kind of do to read Twitter's
3208440	3209440	where people have blocked you.
3209440	3211560	You just I may or may not know this from experience.
3211560	3214360	You can just log out and you can read it.
3214360	3218040	Now, if they're friends locked and they've blocked you,
3218360	3219960	then you're really not going to be able to read it.
3219960	3222720	That's the only way. But nobody's friends locked on Twitch.
3222960	3224920	What? Technically, the options there.
3224920	3226080	But why would you use it?
3226080	3230560	You would you wouldn't you know, you'd just be you wouldn't grow at all.
3230560	3232200	You can't you can't do it that way. So.
3234600	3236360	But yeah, I mean, I do agree
3236360	3239440	that people shouldn't be watching a channel they've been banned from.
3239440	3241760	So it's it's something like that.
3241760	3245560	Didrom S says Twitch is trying to tie it to your IP address
3245560	3248480	where you still can't view if you're logged out soon.
3248480	3249840	You won't be able to block on birds.
3249840	3252760	Oh, well, don't don't get me started on the VPN, though.
3252760	3255680	Yeah. VPNs are easy. I've used VPN.
3255680	3257640	I am a technological.
3259040	3262200	You know, I don't know my stuff a lot, but I've used a VPN.
3262200	3264480	I had to to play Fafasci 14 for a minute
3265240	3268560	when I had my former Internet provider was having issues of 14.
3268560	3270640	I used a VPN to get around it.
3270640	3273200	So as Joe and Matt says, good.
3273200	3275480	Twitch should also tell them to go outside, touch grass
3275480	3277840	and stop being a shit to people.
3277880	3278480	That would be funny.
3278480	3280600	If that was a splash screen, you could show ban people.
3281720	3285040	Why just Mariah Carey's obsessed album cover?
3285880	3289680	I can think of, though, another thing that I don't like about it
3290640	3295120	is that just think if someone that you had banned
3295120	3300120	from talking in your chat could still add to your viewer numbers.
3302280	3304880	Oh, like one of those like tab.
3305360	3307480	Thanks. Thanks for like.
3307480	3309080	Thanks for giving me free content.
3309080	3311680	Right. What some people would do when they would get hate
3311680	3314720	rated is they would immediately run ads on their channel and be like,
3314720	3315640	thanks for the revenue.
3315640	3317800	Basically, that's what I've done.
3317800	3320720	That type of thinking. Yeah. Yeah, I do get that.
3322520	3324080	Yeah. All right.
3324080	3327080	Well, let's move on to something that hopefully doesn't have to ban
3327080	3330480	a lot of people when they broadcast on different streaming services,
3330480	3332640	and that's the Pokemon Championships.
3333640	3336760	The Pokemon Company announced at the end of their championships
3336760	3340520	that Honolulu is going to be the place where the Pokemon
3340520	3344360	World Championships 2024 will be occurring.
3344560	3348200	Now, obviously, this timing is not great
3348640	3352040	with what is going on in Hawaii right now, because there's a lot of debate
3352040	3355040	about is tourism appropriate in Hawaii right now and all this with what's
3355040	3358880	going on with the Maui wildfires, which continue to be extremely devastating.
3359040	3362800	However, Pokemon Company is doing a very good thing here
3362960	3366600	that they are making an immediate monetary donation of two hundred
3366600	3369600	thousand dollars to help relief efforts.
3369600	3370880	In a statement, they said,
3370880	3374320	Our hearts go out to all those who've been impacted by the devastating wildfires
3374320	3376840	in Hawaii to support relief efforts.
3376840	3379880	The Pokemon Company International is making an immediate monetary donation
3379880	3382480	of two hundred thousand dollars to its partner at Global Giving
3382480	3384920	through its Hawaii Wildlife Relief Fund.
3384920	3387320	To learn more about Global Giving's local relief efforts
3387320	3389360	and to join in supporting the people of Hawaii,
3389360	3393600	please visit global giving dot org slash Pokemon.
3394160	3396960	So that that is nice.
3397600	3401240	And I'm sure this is the type of thing that contracts were booked.
3401480	3403200	Venues were negotiated.
3403200	3405200	Dotted lines were signed.
3405200	3408480	Well, but it is also and I just want it because somebody will correct me
3408480	3409320	if I don't say it.
3409320	3413320	Honolulu is on a different island than, you know, Lahaina.
3413800	3418120	Yes, but certainly the entire state is still feeling the impact
3418120	3421400	because Oahu is supporting a lot of people
3421400	3425200	that have suddenly had to relocate off of Maui due to what is going on
3425200	3427000	and all that, you know, families and all this stuff.
3427000	3430560	So the brunt of what is happening is being felt everywhere in the state.
3430760	3432720	So, you know, there's a lot of talk about, you know,
3432720	3435080	what is and isn't appropriate right now.
3435080	3438720	But obviously all this stuff was signed and all this stuff well before
3440600	3443120	the the fires happened. So.
3443560	3448520	Um. Also, interesting, another game I played this weekend,
3448520	3451560	I got together with some friends to play our good old Ingress game
3452200	3455160	because there was a global event happening and there's
3455160	3458920	there's ways you can kind of help the global event from other places.
3458920	3461080	So we were getting together to do that.
3461360	3464960	And there was talk about that there's actually one of these,
3465120	3469000	you know, events competitions is in Honolulu in December.
3469200	3472400	Again, it was announced back in January that it was going to be happening
3472400	3474200	in December in Honolulu.
3474200	3475960	But now a lot of question about.
3475960	3478240	I wonder if they'll go through with it at this point.
3479400	3481960	So it'd be interesting because I really wanted to go at one point.
3481960	3484960	Now I'm like, no, the the travel dollars this year got spent.
3485880	3487640	I'm not because there's another one in Tacoma,
3487640	3489760	but it's the weekend after Dragon Con.
3489760	3492920	And I was like, oh, there's no way, no way I can go to that.
3493800	3496480	It's too close to Dragon Con.
3496480	3498760	But I was hoping maybe I could make Honolulu work, but.
3499720	3502000	We're doing TwitchCon instead.
3503000	3507440	So, yeah, I'm I'm actually I was going to drive to TwitchCon.
3507440	3509400	I'm thinking about flying instead.
3509400	3512360	Oh, we're flying, but we have to fly funky because
3512800	3515400	we're going to Disneyland for Oogie Boogie like the same week.
3515800	3520640	So we have to fly to Long Beach and then Long Beach to Vegas, Vegas to home.
3521240	3524720	So I had to book three separate flights.
3524720	3526920	But yeah, the Vegas flight is so easy.
3526920	3528920	And there's there you can see.
3528920	3530920	Yeah, Southwest or Delta out of here.
3530920	3532440	And I think one other airline does it, too.
3532440	3534440	Oh, Spirit, but I'd never fly them.
3534440	3536440	Just say, you know,
3537240	3539440	Phil, if you get what you pay for related to that.
3539920	3543600	Phil at night and chat says there's always another con or event around the corner.
3543600	3545240	Truly, truly.
3545240	3548560	There are definitely more than I can physically afford
3548800	3551040	and attend in the same space. So.
3552480	3554760	Bobby Blackwell says bring me back an Oogie Boogie pin.
3555640	3557040	Yeah, absolutely.
3557040	3560680	Bobby Blackwell says be prepared for a possible random screening
3560880	3564000	because they do take a harder look at people with one way tickets.
3564200	3566760	Well, both the husband and I have pre check
3566760	3568800	and I know you can still get picked for one way screenings of that.
3568800	3572960	But I mean, I'm not worried like they're not going to find anything because we.
3573280	3577080	And honestly, we don't really we check because we usually fly
3577080	3578680	Southwest almost all the time.
3578680	3582800	The only time I don't fly Southwest is when I'm going to Atlanta
3582840	3585440	and Delta was competitively priced
3585440	3588960	because your bags go free on Southwest, which is so nice.
3588960	3590560	So we check all of our bags.
3590560	3595080	We don't carry anything on except like an actual like entertainment
3595080	3597000	for the plane bag.
3597000	3599720	And then like, you know, the things you're supposed to have just in case of
3600920	3604440	complete and utter fuck ups in luggage, which, you know, could happen
3604440	3607560	like the underwear, bag medicine, things like that. Yeah.
3608000	3611800	So but, you know, so they're not going to find anything.
3612200	3613760	So let them pull me.
3613760	3616000	I don't care. Just leave time for that.
3616000	3618160	Remember, we're flying out of Sacramento.
3618360	3622280	So but I guess I guess to be fair, the other flights, you know, Vegas,
3622280	3625560	I don't know how thorough or how efficient that airport is.
3625560	3629280	So we'll see. They're pretty efficient from what I remember,
3629280	3633600	because I it wasn't there not long ago, but it's a ways off anyway.
3634560	3637840	All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.
3637840	3641480	So. This has been
3641840	3643800	going around for a little bit.
3643800	3645600	I think we expected it.
3645600	3650840	But now Netflix is going to be opening up
3650840	3655520	to a small number of their subscribers in Canada and the UK,
3655520	3659080	according to a blog post to roll out
3660480	3663280	this video game streaming service.
3664400	3668560	It's going to select TVs and then PCs and Macs.
3668880	3672760	X are on there in the next few weeks.
3674240	3677920	I mean, we basically knew that they were expanding into games
3677920	3680960	around 2021 when they had the Netflix game on mobile.
3682400	3686280	But now they're trying to make it available on even more devices
3686280	3687840	and setting up a test.
3687840	3692480	There is a Netflix game controller app in the Apple App Store.
3693960	3696720	And there's only two games that are going to be part of this test.
3696720	3699200	One is Oxenfree
3699200	3703760	and the other is Mulhugh's Mining Adventure,
3703760	3707280	which is a gem mining arcade type game.
3708280	3711000	You use your phones as a controller.
3711000	3715640	So for the initial beta test, these TVs and connected
3716040	3718520	TV devices will support the games.
3718520	3722400	And that's the Amazon Fire TV streaming media players, Chromecast
3722400	3726320	with Google TV, LG TVs, Nvidia Shield TV,
3726640	3731640	Roku devices and TVs, Samsung smart TVs and Walmart on.
3733160	3738760	So, you know, I actually have a Samsung TV, so who knows?
3739360	3743520	Or no, my TV's an LG either way, but I'm not in Canada or UK.
3744840	3748000	But folks who are in those areas, let us know how it goes.
3748840	3752040	Yeah, if it's successful, it'll certainly roll out of the places, too.
3752040	3755200	So there is that. Yeah. All right.
3756160	3759480	Moving on, Loki's got more on a game I was talking about earlier.
3760080	3763800	Yeah. So, you know, Overwatch,
3764760	3767120	they've, you know, had a rough time
3767920	3771080	with some decisions that weren't necessarily popular.
3771440	3775120	And what do people do when they are upset with a company's decision?
3775760	3781080	They head on over to Metacritic and review bomb them or the other platforms as well.
3781480	3784000	So they start a change.org petition.
3784800	3786440	Yeah, that's what that'll work.
3786440	3788920	Yeah, for sure.
3788920	3791760	So, of course, you know, Blizzard has responded to the Overwatch
3791760	3796160	to review bombing with PR speak, as to be expected.
3796320	3799600	This is although being review bombed isn't a fun experience.
3800000	3804000	It's been great to see lots of new players jump into Overwatch
3804000	3805280	two for the first time.
3805280	3808440	Our goal with Overwatch two is to make the game more accessible
3808440	3811200	than ever for more people than ever before.
3811600	3815920	And, you know, if we can't turn back the clock, then what can we do?
3815920	3818440	We keep adding and improving Overwatch two.
3818600	3821000	This is how we move forward.
3821400	3822960	If I could turn.
3822960	3827400	Yeah, but that kind of like also ignores all the fact that like you promise
3827400	3830840	something, you didn't deliver it, and now you're charging
3830840	3834800	for some of the things that you did promise originally as part of the base package.
3836920	3839360	That's not really the same thing, but.
3840360	3843160	I mean, what you going to do?
3843160	3844200	Blizzard's going to blizzard.
3844200	3848520	So, you know, honestly, if you're happy with it, play the game.
3848520	3850200	If you're not happy with it, don't play the game.
3850200	3852400	I mean, same thing with voting with your wallet.
3852400	3856800	If you want to pay for that content, then pay for the content.
3856800	3860800	But really, all you're doing is encouraging them to kind of do this kind of stuff.
3863080	3867160	I mean, for me, it's no skin off my back because I'm not playing Overwatch two.
3867200	3870760	And so therefore, the PV stuff doesn't really bother me.
3871040	3875800	Here's here's how I feel about I want to talk about this, because I recently am more,
3875800	3878800	you know, I played Overwatch two for like a week when it first came out.
3878800	3883040	And only recently am I kind of getting back into it just because of friends
3883040	3885120	that play it and, you know, peer pressure and playing games
3885120	3887320	with friends is always more fun and that type of thing, right?
3887920	3892040	Like, am I bothered at the lack of PV because they had promised originally?
3892040	3894680	Yeah, I am, because that shit sounded pretty awesome.
3894680	3898000	And I think it's a real bummer that they haven't really properly delivered on that.
3898200	3900320	That's why I haven't really given Overwatch any money.
3900680	3904240	You know, even though I've played it a bit, I really don't spend money on it
3904240	3906880	because I'm not I'm not interested in skins and that sort of thing.
3907160	3910920	I I will openly say, though, and I don't know if this is
3910920	3913840	because of, you know, Microsoft coming in in the future or whatever.
3914080	3917960	They have a deal on Game Pass where you can actually unlock
3917960	3922360	all the new heroes instantly through the what's her name?
3922360	3925200	The brand new one, Alari, the sun healer that just came out.
3925200	3927400	I'm sorry if I butchered her name, I don't remember the moment
3927400	3929960	I've played her like twice because I'm not very good with her.
3930560	3933800	But you can get all of the heroes on Xbox Game Pass.
3934000	3937320	Now you get it for the Xbox version of the game.
3937560	3941840	But now that it's all linked together, you fire up the Xbox version of the game.
3941840	3944200	And then guess what? It's all unlocked on the PC version of the game.
3944840	3946920	So I actually got all the heroes that way.
3946920	3950520	So I guess I've used my Game Pass subscription for that.
3950520	3952280	But otherwise, I don't really give it money.
3952440	3954320	But here's the thing, here's the point I really want to make.
3955080	3960960	For me, this whole PvE thing is a very similar sort of situation to No Man's Sky.
3961560	3965320	And what I mean by that is when No Man's Sky first came out,
3965320	3970920	it rightfully took a beating from the gaming public because so much
3971600	3976800	that was promised was not delivered on such as, oh, you multiplayer
3976800	3980040	and that whole thing, right? Like, yeah, well, the odds are really low.
3980040	3981880	You'd ever run into somebody in space.
3981880	3984400	But maybe, you know, maybe you'll see it someday.
3984560	3987400	And then that turned out that all that all was like a fucking lie.
3987400	3990000	Like, like you would never actually others see people.
3990400	3992120	But then they patched it in later.
3993320	3997240	No Man's Sky got a lot of credit from the gaming public
3997240	4001160	back by improving it consistently with patches.
4001680	4003120	And it took a little while.
4003440	4008040	But now No Man's Sky is coming up on its seven year anniversary as a game.
4008320	4011320	And guess what? Guess what they teased on Twitter last week?
4011480	4015160	Yet another patch coming for the game with more features and so forth.
4015160	4016640	That's going to make the game even better.
4016640	4020320	And as somebody who's a big fan now of No Man's Sky, I think that's awesome.
4020600	4024040	So I think Blizzard should look to that as a model
4024040	4026400	for how to turn Overwatch 2 around.
4026880	4032320	Just fucking deliver like people will forgive you if you fucking deliver.
4032760	4036600	But if you suddenly do the anthem thing
4037160	4042120	and just shut it down, don't deliver back out and support,
4042160	4045360	pull the plug, five dollars on the shelf at GameStop,
4045880	4049480	then you're going to be you're going to be a laughing stock in history.
4049480	4052920	I don't know if I don't think Overwatch 2 is really at that level of bad,
4053120	4056280	but I think people will never be able to get past what was promised,
4056560	4060880	you know, pre pandemic and so forth if Blizzard were to shut it down.
4060880	4062640	But I don't see Blizzard doing that either.
4062640	4065600	I feel like they're still just they're going to make it work one way or the other.
4065640	4069360	But it's just it's going to take some of these verbal beatings online,
4069360	4071320	but continuing to stick to the plan
4071320	4074360	and making the game the best possible that it could be.
4076520	4078360	Yeah, bonds 006 says, LOL,
4078360	4081320	are you asking Blizzard to take notes how to improve a game in good faith?
4081480	4083240	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
4083240	4087680	Well, although I understand what you're saying, I got two words for you.
4088280	4089920	Diablo 3.
4089920	4096520	Questbuster in chat says No Man's Sky was functional at launch
4096520	4100280	and minimally viable enough to play with, but it was incredibly shallow.
4100280	4103640	And this is from someone that actually completed a trip to the center of the galaxy.
4103880	4107400	Today's No Man's Sky, though repeating what Rob is saying is pretty incredible stuff.
4107400	4109360	Absolutely. You know, it'd be interesting.
4109360	4114640	I got to I'm trying to find my disc copy of No Man's Sky
4115040	4117360	because I have that original 1.0 version.
4117360	4119280	I'd love to go back and play that again
4119280	4122920	just to see how much has changed from the very beginning,
4123080	4125200	because I bet it's pretty new.
4125200	4127760	I think it would, because you can play it offline.
4127760	4128960	You just pull the.
4128960	4133400	I mean, I'd have to have I'd have to have a PS4 to play it on.
4134320	4137240	But I could do mine. Yeah.
4138080	4140640	So or just remove everything that's on my PS4.
4140640	4142680	But yeah, anyway.
4142680	4145120	Yeah. Questbuster says OMG, so much stuff is different.
4145120	4146280	It'd really be interesting to see.
4146280	4149520	I'm sure someone on YouTube's done it, but maybe I need to do it, too.
4149520	4151600	We'll see. We'll see. Anyway.
4151600	4155920	So, you know, I do you know, as somebody who wants to see Blizzard succeed
4155920	4160080	eventually, like obviously I've had my criticisms of them as a company,
4160080	4163920	and pretty much all of that can be traced to either people
4163920	4168840	that are no longer with Blizzard or one particular Activision CEO
4168840	4172600	who is continues to be a poison toxic individual in this industry
4172600	4175560	that is long overstayed, is welcome and easy to get the fuck out of here.
4175720	4179040	But unfortunately is hanging on for that separation fee.
4179800	4183040	You know, that will inevitably come once this Microsoft merger goes through.
4183040	4186240	But it's not a court case supposed to be coming up here soon.
4186640	4189000	Like I thought it was at the end of this month.
4189000	4191080	I think so. I think so.
4191520	4193680	Maybe that's actually just apart from him.
4193680	4196240	I also have problems with certain people
4196240	4198440	that play that game that I don't want to associate with.
4200840	4204360	All right, let's move on to our next story,
4204400	4206280	which I think is me.
4206280	4207600	Yes, it is. All right.
4207600	4210840	So there's been a lot of talk about the Steam Deck.
4211680	4213760	The Steam Deck is, of course,
4213760	4218400	a physical hardware device that's been doing very well.
4219200	4222040	And there's people like me that are like, you know,
4222040	4223840	I'll be interested in getting a Steam Deck
4223840	4225880	when they release a more powerful Steam Deck,
4225880	4228640	because we know it's coming eventually, but not yet.
4228640	4231320	But that hasn't because basically a Steam Deck is,
4231680	4233720	you know, it's a PC device.
4233720	4236520	It's not proprietary based stuff.
4236520	4238960	We're seeing more competitors happen.
4238960	4242880	And so now we're going to have one that's incoming from Lenovo.
4243120	4247760	And some leaked images have revealed that the Lenovo Legion Go
4248400	4251440	is part Steam Deck and part Nintendo Switch.
4251440	4254320	When we talk about the removable little devices
4254320	4257080	that click into the monitor, it's certainly that whole thing.
4258200	4260320	So it was reported by Windows Central
4260320	4265440	that Lenovo was working on a handheld gaming PC that runs Windows.
4265720	4269800	Windows Report this week published the first images of the device,
4269800	4272840	allegedly what it is, you know, could be an elaborate Photoshop.
4272840	4274320	But I don't know. I don't know.
4274320	4276800	This one looks like it could be pretty, pretty solid.
4277120	4281120	Apparently, there is also one that shows that AR glasses
4281120	4282960	could be working with the device as well.
4282960	4286400	It could be something else that, you know, this this device is bringing.
4286640	4288320	So we'll see.
4288360	4291160	Apparently, the device has a kickstand similar to a Switch
4291640	4293800	that you can use to lean the screen back
4293800	4296520	so you can pick up the controllers and play as well.
4296520	4300880	So it's really a little bit of a blend of the Switch and the Steam Deck.
4301120	4307120	So, yeah, also, Lenovo is making the device pretty.
4307120	4311240	It's it's kind of thick and, you know, it's it's it's got a lot to it.
4311480	4312920	But I'm assuming that's to support,
4312920	4316280	you know, battery life and power in that device and so forth.
4316280	4320800	So the AR glasses in the report, supposedly part of an ecosystem
4320800	4323640	that is going to be launched alongside the Legion Go.
4324440	4327600	In the leaked promotional image, somebody wearing the glasses
4327800	4331440	is looking at the game on a screen that's projected in midair.
4332120	4334840	Who knows if this is something sold separately or a bundle?
4334840	4336840	I would hope it's sold separately because you don't
4337360	4340160	you don't want to bundle required hardware
4340160	4344400	unless it is damn proven hardware like the Nintendo.
4344400	4345600	We got away with it.
4345600	4347760	It was central to that device.
4347760	4350000	The Xbox one, when they bundled connect.
4350320	4351840	Yeah, it didn't go so well.
4351840	4354520	So just, you know, food for thought.
4354520	4357080	The Legion Go will run Windows 11.
4357080	4360000	So you should be able to run anything that runs on Windows 11,
4360000	4363040	which is most games that you see on the Steam marketplace.
4363320	4367320	That's for sure. So is it going to have any sort of though,
4367320	4370280	like video out from it? Like.
4371120	4372160	Does it say anything about that?
4372160	4375000	That is a good question, because it didn't really say about like, does it?
4375000	4378480	Does it pop into a dock or something like that?
4378760	4380880	I'm not sure I see anything like that.
4380880	4384320	I'm trying to look at the leaked image of the device to see if I see an output.
4384320	4386400	And I don't see one in those pictures,
4386600	4390160	but I also can't see the bottom of the device where it would logically be.
4390600	4392960	So I can't rule it out yet.
4392960	4394760	But again, while this is still a rumor,
4394760	4396920	we're going to have to wait for the official announcement to know
4397120	4398480	how would it hook up?
4398480	4401400	Is it is there like a dock type of thing or just an HDMI output
4401400	4402680	or something like that?
4402680	4404360	We'd have to hear more about that.
4404360	4405960	Yeah, same, same.
4405960	4407600	So because I mean, I will.
4407600	4412080	I mean, then again, I have a I have a reason now that I could get a steam
4412080	4414880	because I mean, the biggest problem people are having with Steamdex
4414880	4418800	as well was that not everything was Linux compatible. Mm hmm.
4419880	4422880	You know, like that was what was holding me off from Dead by Daylight, for example.
4424000	4426080	They've they've since put in that compatibility
4426080	4429000	and a lot more games are compatible.
4429000	4432160	I don't know if power would be.
4432200	4435040	I mean, it's just a side note. Yeah.
4436080	4438400	All right. Well, moving on to
4439760	4443000	a really interesting story at our Sakura.
4443000	4449120	So. I have to give some some preface to this.
4449640	4456640	So there is a developer named Luke Bernard who released a game this year.
4457480	4459080	It came out.
4460000	4462640	I think it officially came out in June, July,
4462960	4466400	that's called A Light in the Darkness, and in this game,
4466720	4472760	you play as a French Jewish family in the years preceding and during the Holocaust.
4474400	4480240	And it's it's it's a very realistic
4480480	4482960	game for experience and it's free.
4484200	4487880	But the he was, you know, sort of inspired
4487880	4492040	to start the idea after he found out that his
4493680	4497440	grandmother was part of the.
4499600	4502920	British resistance that smuggled children out of
4503680	4506240	out of Nazi occupied regions
4508560	4512440	and that that he's Jewish by by maternal line.
4512600	4515440	So at any rate,
4515440	4519880	he started, you know, in trying to find places to get his game to go,
4520120	4526320	you know, eventually was wanting to make sure that video games could be used
4526320	4532200	as educational tools for keeping the history of this
4532400	4538120	horrific event live in modern memory, you know, because our
4538560	4542280	our survivors are almost all gone, you know.
4543120	4547000	And so he
4548000	4552200	is working with the the Fortnite people.
4552920	4558800	And so now in in Fortnite, there is a Holocaust museum.
4559720	4564960	And basically you can go in and see
4566200	4571560	in a certain certain stories, you know, basically there was a lot of
4573280	4578000	a lot of restrictions and different things that made it very difficult.
4580760	4585720	But now there are certain stories that are being told
4585720	4590080	through this sort of educational museum within the game.
4591680	4595600	And so there there have been.
4597080	4600920	Some people who are against it, who don't think that, you know,
4601640	4605120	putting it in a video game, you know, would be best
4605120	4608760	because it might trivialize it or that there's a thing to win.
4608760	4610760	But, you know, there's other people who are like, yeah,
4610760	4612720	you can tell a story through a game.
4612720	4617160	And so that's, I think, a big step on this is having this sort of museum
4617160	4620840	now inside a Fortnite.
4621600	4625080	So can I can I say sorry?
4625080	4628200	I just want to mention a hard pass on that perspective
4628240	4631080	that this somehow trivializes it by putting it in Fortnite.
4631080	4634680	I'm sorry, I see this as teaching the people that need to be taught
4634680	4637040	this sort of stuff, meeting them where they are.
4637040	4638600	That's that's what this is.
4638600	4641600	This this really kind of speaks to me in a similar kind of capacity
4641600	4645920	to how when we were young, you know, we would go to the computer lab
4645920	4649720	on an Apple IIe and on Fridays we would play games.
4649720	4652360	But on other days we might play something like, you know,
4652680	4655080	the Oregon Trail or something where we were learning
4655080	4657560	or even doing like simple logo, we're actually learning.
4657560	4661280	Now, obviously, it was nothing learning about history in this regard.
4661560	4664680	But I think we know that, you know, with Fortnite being this,
4664680	4668240	you know, game engine and a lot of people, a lot of kids,
4668520	4672400	especially around the age of Loki's kids, I would imagine they know Fortnite.
4672600	4677080	They that's, you know, they don't like Fortnite, but they know interesting.
4677080	4679200	I thought there were a lot of kids that do like Fortnite.
4679200	4681240	But, you know, there are might not my kids.
4681240	4684600	My kids are Roblox kids, unfortunately, Fortnite kids.
4684600	4686880	But now they're like, they're too cool for Fortnite.
4687080	4689160	But still, I think it's meeting a lot more.
4689160	4691120	Yeah, OK, there's a lot more about it, though.
4693800	4698960	So he's been trying to partner with the Anti-Defamation League,
4699320	4701920	who have been very silent with him.
4703960	4707000	And, you know.
4707000	4711840	They're trying, they are working with the group Lost Tribe, though,
4712320	4716760	for combating the casual anti-Semitism
4716760	4720520	that you, you know, people encounter online, including in games.
4722520	4726400	They have found so much anti-Semitism
4726400	4729440	just rampant on Discord, on Twitch,
4730440	4733920	even incorporated into game storylines,
4733920	4739760	although I guess not consciously, you know, it's just this
4740320	4742760	built in culture.
4743280	4748360	And, you know, they're trying to,
4748360	4750720	you know, they even, you know, he's even talking about,
4750920	4754480	you know, trying to get Activision to make changes.
4756880	4762400	That, you know, because Call of Duty has especially big anti-Semitic community.
4764960	4768400	And so going on further, though,
4768400	4770360	is that this Fortnite museum
4772440	4775280	have basically their on-screen
4775280	4778800	communication tools are disabled.
4779320	4782720	They cannot manipulate the environment at all.
4783040	4789280	They are basically making it like a real museum you go in.
4792240	4794200	And so.
4795040	4797760	There are, you know.
4799880	4803080	Like this is one on here, it's basically
4803600	4807560	the CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, of ADL
4809800	4814040	was saying that it could be potentially worthwhile.
4814160	4816360	But he goes on to say, and I'm going to read a quote,
4816600	4819800	until the game industry can change the norms of hate and abuse
4819800	4823080	in online multiplayer games, we cannot view experiences like these
4823280	4827480	as a true alternative to more traditional forms of Holocaust education.
4828280	4830680	But it's something it's doing something right.
4831080	4833160	I understand the frustration and the comment.
4833160	4836040	And I don't want to say, like, I outright disagree with it.
4836040	4839360	But I would encourage that person to kind of take the alternate perspective of,
4839360	4842160	again, sometimes you have to meet the people where they are.
4842160	4845120	And it's that kind of thing where, you know, by going to Fortnite
4845120	4848000	and showing, you know, people like when you use that language,
4848000	4849320	that's this is what it means.
4849320	4850280	You know, this is what it really is.
4850280	4853360	And actually, you know, something to keep in the back of our minds.
4853520	4856960	This is not the first time Fortnite has taken on a very serious topic
4856960	4859800	like this with a educational museum interactive experience.
4860560	4862240	It was just I think it was a couple of years ago,
4862240	4864760	but there was the whole Martin Luther King March for Time thing
4864960	4868200	that came right around that time of, you know, a lot of the
4868920	4873520	racial, you know, injustice, you know, talks that were happening in this country.
4874120	4878800	We saw that experience open up at Fortnite and to what I believe anyway,
4878800	4883160	maybe, maybe naively so, but was a lot of very positive,
4883160	4887600	sort of like this is a really cool thing to see that Fortnite is doing
4887600	4889680	and able to show that.
4889680	4892600	So I hope I hope folks
4893800	4897160	that have a little say and pull and looking at where they do
4897160	4900040	and they don't partner can take a look at things like that
4900040	4903640	and maybe the impact it's had and how it could be useful for something like this, too.
4904840	4908520	Well, and see that some of the things that go in there,
4908560	4912720	I mean, there is some stuff that like is like right from Wikipedia.
4913360	4916560	But there's there's other things going on,
4916560	4920280	just like some of the lesser known tales of resistance,
4920840	4925080	you know, spotlighting aspects of the Dutch resistance, for example.
4926680	4932440	You know, just very various, you know, different different things that are
4933400	4935480	the stories you don't hear every day.
4935920	4937880	You know what I mean? Right.
4938520	4943080	And now, as far as his game, The Light in the Darkness,
4943680	4946720	it is available for free on Epic.
4946760	4948120	I didn't check Steam yet.
4948120	4950280	I found a completely different game with the same name,
4951520	4953520	but it's on PS5.
4953520	4956400	It's on different consoles and it is free.
4957440	4960800	And he went from trying to tell like, you know,
4961280	4967600	oh, the little kid, unrealistic view to actually you are living this event
4967600	4969040	and it doesn't end well.
4970680	4972680	You know, so sort of, you know,
4973200	4979360	this is the extreme end of what your harmful words can lead to.
4980920	4982240	Don't repeat it.
4982240	4984840	I really love this comment from QuestBuster in our chat over
4984840	4986360	twitch.tv slash vog network.
4986360	4989000	QuestBuster says, I always applaud efforts like this.
4989280	4992320	The medium has always played to its strengths in creative ways
4992320	4995320	from Oregon Trail to titles like This War of Mine
4995480	4998600	to efforts like those in Assassin's Creed, Origin and Valhalla
4998600	5003480	as history walkabouts to perhaps inspire someone out there to simply ask,
5003480	5005400	hey, is there a way to know more?
5007000	5014440	Yeah, I actually I've had the game on my my radar for a little bit.
5014920	5018640	As soon as I can figure out a good way to play it, I totally will.
5019280	5022280	But I'm I'm pretty
5022960	5027280	I'm just excited that the Fortnite folks have gone along with this, too,
5027280	5032760	that they're they're in there to have some real education
5032760	5036520	going on in a silly game that has a llama for a mascot.
5038160	5041920	You know, and and and I've I've had this discussion
5041920	5045800	actually with a coworker as far as, you know, talking about training material.
5046160	5050440	And there's a really good book out there called The Gamification of Training.
5051000	5057080	But I look at the same thing as also training, education,
5057520	5060720	presenting things, because some people will learn better
5060720	5063000	by participating in a thing.
5063000	5065560	And if you can offer this up in a virtual environment
5065560	5069760	and have someone participate with the game or with the content,
5069760	5073920	you know, having it in an interactable, you know, area
5074480	5079160	that I think that it cements those those stories in people's minds again
5079160	5082680	and keeps it in the the modern consciousness
5083120	5086160	before we lose the people who've who lived it.
5087840	5090760	Philanine in our chat says, I think it's cool,
5090760	5093440	but it's kind of like handing out copies of the Barbie movie
5093440	5095680	at an NRA convention.
5095680	5096920	I understand disagree.
5096920	5099560	I understand the perspective to an extent.
5099600	5103360	However, there's something to be said about
5103360	5105920	when they kind of strip out some of the multiplayer
5105920	5108360	and some of the essentially what leads to group think
5108560	5112520	and the reason why people behave like asshats online
5113360	5118120	is to, you know, try to get a rise, impress, do things with other people.
5118480	5121680	When you kind of take the interactions with other people out of it
5121680	5124560	and in these particular experiences, even though they're in a multiplayer
5124560	5128000	environment, you are left with you
5128560	5132160	and the facts, the history, the exhibits, the evidence.
5132520	5136640	And you have the chance to have some self-reflection
5136640	5137680	with those sorts of things.
5137720	5139240	Is that going to work with everybody?
5139240	5140920	Absolutely not.
5140920	5144200	But could it succeed in reaching through to a couple of people
5144480	5147360	and making them think differently when they're confronted with
5147920	5152880	the actual history and the evidence of what these sorts of things have led to?
5154720	5155400	It's worth trying.
5155400	5157920	It's worth it's worth trying.
5157920	5162040	You know what it takes, I think, to dismantle any kind of bigotry,
5162040	5164120	hatred like that, even casually.
5164120	5167000	Mm hmm. Hey, that's not cool.
5167640	5170120	Mm hmm. One person saying, hey, that's not cool. That's right.
5170760	5174000	Or I'd appreciate if you didn't say that around me. That's right.
5174840	5178320	You know, it requires one person
5179000	5182560	to be brave enough to think for themselves.
5183720	5187040	And tell their buddies, I don't appreciate it, and if they're their friends,
5187600	5189720	there's not going to be a problem.
5189720	5192720	And, you know, and I'll even put it this way, and this might be
5192720	5195960	just my perspective from, you know, lots of different crap
5195960	5198680	I personally live through, but.
5200400	5203480	It it's easy to be the sheep.
5204080	5206440	It's harder to be the wolf.
5207320	5210440	You know, also, now that I'm sitting here really thinking about it,
5210440	5212760	and again, I don't want to sound like I'm picking on the listener
5212760	5216240	because I completely understand where this comment comes from. I do.
5216760	5219960	But it's it's when I when I look at the whole like it's handing out copies,
5219960	5221960	the Barbie movie at NRA convention.
5221960	5224240	Isn't the opposite true?
5224240	5227360	Don't they? Isn't the opposite actively happening?
5228040	5230280	Because I was thinking about I was at the mall
5230640	5232440	and I was doing the whole Pokemon Go thing.
5232440	5235720	There was a little table set up of a certain religious affiliation
5235920	5238400	that was just sitting there waiting to answer any questions.
5238600	5242120	And I you know, I got to think like they sit there all day with that damn table.
5242600	5245240	Does anyone actually come up and talk to them like, hey, yes,
5245440	5248520	I'm interested in that religion that you go door to door pedaling anyway.
5248920	5251480	They wouldn't do it if it didn't work at least once. Right.
5251800	5255960	And on top of that, on top of that, again, to continue this analogy,
5256520	5260280	as I was walking back to my car, I was walking, you know, past
5260280	5263800	like the Starbucks, the Macy's, I get stopped by this guy.
5264080	5267640	And I'm not going to lie, he was an attractive younger.
5267680	5269240	When I say younger, I mean like mid 20s.
5269240	5270440	Remember, I'm in my 40s now.
5270440	5274680	Younger and younger guy that was like, hey, you just like
5275040	5277440	I just felt like an energy from you.
5277440	5279480	I just wanted to say hello to you.
5279480	5283320	And I was like, and my honest to God, my my brain was like,
5283600	5287400	did did my fat thumb activate Grindr in this mall or something?
5287400	5291080	Like, why is this person like why is this person like randomly?
5291440	5292520	I'm not going to lie.
5292520	5296520	I'm fairly attractive Latino guy walking up to me, talking to me. Right.
5296840	5298960	And cutie. Yeah.
5299120	5301720	But but then here's here's the punch line.
5301920	5304480	And so I go, you know, because I'm kind of like deer in headlights.
5304480	5306960	I'm like, thanks. Yeah.
5307280	5308400	Cool. What's up?
5308400	5309320	You know, type of thing.
5309320	5313520	He's like, I just wanted to know, is there is there anything I can pray for you now?
5313760	5315400	Is it can I pray for you?
5315400	5317600	Yeah, there you go. There's the punch line, right?
5317600	5319840	Can I can I is there anything I can pray for you?
5320240	5322320	And I don't know what I'm going to say. I'm gonna be honest.
5322360	5324680	I don't know what it was about the moment, but I was like,
5324680	5327840	I didn't feel like being the guy that just wanted to say, like,
5327840	5330000	you know, roll my eyes and say fuck off and walk away.
5330000	5331080	I didn't really want to do that.
5331080	5335040	So I just said I said, I said, you know, if it'll if it'll make this
5335840	5340800	mildly attractive man happy, I'm going to say, yes.
5340800	5341200	You know what?
5341200	5344600	My my dad is actually having an investigative procedure right now.
5344800	5347600	So if you want to keep him in your thoughts, I'd appreciate that. Right.
5347800	5351840	I said that. And he said he said, I I will do that.
5351880	5353400	He said, I'm going to do that for you.
5353400	5355680	And I just want you to know God loves you.
5355680	5359000	And I say I just kind of now and I'm really deer in the headlights.
5359000	5360520	I smile because what am I supposed to say?
5360520	5363760	I think I'm supposed to say I love God, too, or whatever. I don't know.
5364000	5367600	But I just said I said, oh, OK.
5367800	5370000	And he goes, you know that, right? God loves you.
5370000	5372560	And I just smiled and I looked at him dead in the eye and I said,
5373320	5375440	it's complicated. And I walked away.
5377000	5379120	Yeah. How was it?
5379120	5382640	I take the approach outlined by Margaret
5382640	5386200	Tres mother and I apply it to many situations.
5387360	5389400	Don't punch. Say thank you.
5389400	5391360	Yeah. You know who else loves you?
5391360	5393360	Rob Starfish loves you.
5394480	5398160	You know who loves me?
5399280	5401640	My cat when I'm feeding her.
5401640	5406320	But I'm just can can we have more middle aged attractive men?
5410320	5412920	All right. Anyway, I guess
5412920	5415600	I'm just yes, I yes, I'm married.
5415600	5418560	But, you know, we all like attention.
5419560	5421960	All right. Moving on.
5421960	5423560	What do we have next?
5423880	5426160	I think we're over to Loki, right?
5426160	5429520	Yes. Yes. So this is eight strikes.
5429520	5432440	You're out because, you know, three, that's too little.
5432760	5436240	Let's give you eight warnings before we kick you off the Xbox platform
5436800	5438760	for only a year.
5438760	5441040	So they do.
5442640	5446200	Yeah. So basically now they have this new system.
5446240	5450400	They were already doing these different enforcements before.
5450400	5453720	But now if you get eight, there's they're kind of
5454600	5458560	drawing the equivalent to like the license system
5458760	5461760	like your driver's license, where if you get points on your driver's license,
5462280	5465040	then certain things happen like you certain restrictions.
5465040	5469520	So, for example, you know, with the first point, you get a warning.
5469840	5473160	If you get three points, you're going to be, you know, off the platform
5473160	5475680	for, you know, seven days.
5476560	5479160	You keep doing that, then you're going to be off for a year.
5480520	5484120	And points will fall off of the person's record after six months.
5484720	5486120	I think it's too much, though.
5486120	5489000	I think that they should do it permanently.
5489000	5493080	Honestly, DMV, Jesus, like, well, not the DMV, but like, yeah,
5493280	5495160	the rolling point window and all this.
5495160	5497760	Well, yeah. So they say, you know what, you know what?
5497760	5501000	If you commit too many offenses on Xbox,
5501000	5504000	you should have to go to the equivalent of traffic school.
5504160	5506600	But for Xbox Live, you should have to go.
5507600	5510320	Yeah, you have to go to etiquette school to comedy.
5510520	5513480	Stop saying slurs on the Internet school.
5513480	5515200	That's that's what you need to do.
5515200	5516360	Just like violating.
5516360	5518360	Pretty funny. Too many.
5518360	5520840	You're going to do the same thing that I do with traffic school,
5520840	5523080	and that's just test out.
5525560	5528120	Yeah, so that's the thing that they have now.
5528640	5532080	Just, you know, honestly, I think the year is not long enough.
5532080	5536000	I mean, if you're you're getting eight violations within six months,
5537280	5538440	electric, that's a you.
5538440	5539600	That's a you problem.
5539600	5541640	So like, you know, obviously.
5543000	5545040	Well, you just change your behavior.
5545040	5546880	Don't be like this.
5546880	5549760	Oh, my God. This comment from SSJ 100, Matt,
5550120	5553240	maybe I'm not under maybe I'm not understanding it well,
5553360	5556160	but it kind of feels like a Wendy's pick a menu.
5557000	5562280	I could say cheat three times and do hate speech twice before getting banned
5562640	5566680	or commit hate speech twice and do some harassment once.
5566800	5568760	It just seems convoluted.
5568760	5571560	Why give someone another chance to do hate speech?
5571760	5574840	Why give a person another two or three times to hurt someone?
5575000	5577320	I get what they're trying to do, but I feel not every
5577760	5581160	every situation fits into a fancy sliding scale.
5581160	5584320	And I'm sorry to be laughing at this, you know, because these these situations
5584320	5588320	are not funny. Yeah, but yes, the Wendy's pick a menu of it all
5588320	5592080	and like trying to put these into like literal buckets of, you know,
5592080	5595320	how bad is the crime is kind of humorous.
5595320	5597560	You know, it's just the whole system is a little strange.
5598200	5601280	I am thinking of one particular situation, though,
5601720	5606840	and that would be like what of, you know, children who,
5606840	5609640	you know, get a little bit more maturity over the course of a year.
5611000	5613200	And maybe that's why they have the rolling window.
5614120	5615760	Yeah, perhaps.
5615760	5621200	I do think I'm thinking of I do think with any discipline system online,
5621200	5624640	there ought to be a valid appeal method, you know.
5624640	5627600	And if the appeal method is
5627880	5632240	I went to to traffic school and test it out and learn better.
5632240	5633200	I know how to do that.
5633200	5636840	Then, you know, I think somebody should be given another chance.
5636840	5639000	But someone told me not to be in thinking.
5639000	5640760	No one's ever told me that before.
5640760	5642400	To quote Dwight's truth.
5642400	5644160	That's a demerit. Three demerits.
5644160	5648600	You'll receive a citation, five citations, and you're looking at a violation.
5649000	5650160	Four of those.
5650160	5651680	And you'll receive a verbal warning.
5651680	5654520	Keep it up. And you're looking at a written warning.
5654520	5655480	Two of those.
5655480	5658920	That'll land you in a world of hurt in the form of a disciplinary review
5659040	5662560	written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
5665880	5669120	Perfect. And on that note,
5669560	5674400	let's go back to a time when, you know, there was no there was no point system.
5674600	5677160	If you fucked up, mom took the cord to your system.
5677200	5678360	That's what happens.
5678360	5679960	Let's go to the next segment.
5690400	5694320	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive
5694320	5697800	into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5698160	5700880	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5701920	5704920	And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?
5704920	5706480	I teethed this earlier.
5706480	5708560	I picked Nightmare in the Dark.
5709840	5714320	So Nightmare in the Dark is a platform
5714320	5717360	arcade game that was developed by AM factory.
5719440	5721960	You know what, I'm stupid because I picked a game.
5721960	5723480	Never mind, I'm not stupid.
5723480	5724960	I take that back.
5724960	5726000	It came out in 2000.
5726000	5729800	And for just a moment, my brain rewinded itself in time and was like,
5729800	5731840	that wasn't yeah, it was more than 10 years ago.
5733080	5736280	So anyway, it was developed by AM factory.
5736880	5741040	Also assisted by PALN and it was released by Eleven
5741040	5745280	slash Gather King on January 27th, 2000,
5745520	5747200	except it wasn't actually released.
5747200	5751520	It never got an official release for either the Neo Geo AES,
5751520	5753880	the home version or Neo Geo CD platforms.
5755800	5760600	It's the story of a gravekeeper
5760840	5763360	who finds that his graves are being desecrated
5763760	5766040	and he's trying to stop the grave robbers.
5767320	5770160	So this game.
5771720	5772440	Actually, I take that back.
5772440	5777720	It did get released on Neo Geo MVS, but there was no home release.
5778320	5780160	I mean, which is stupid because if it was MVS,
5780160	5781640	it would have been easy to do AES.
5781640	5783080	But anyway, anyway.
5783080	5786880	So basically, it's it's Bubble Bobble
5786880	5789120	slash Snow Brothers, the goth version.
5790440	5793080	So you play the little gravekeeper
5793400	5795320	and you have to
5796360	5800520	go around and and throw fire from your lantern
5800520	5802920	at these different enemies and eventually turn them
5802920	5806720	into a big ball of fire that you can throw at enemies.
5807920	5810360	Basically, you have to have the biggest balls of them all.
5811680	5814200	And of course, they roll through the level and destroy things
5814200	5816560	and you get goodies for everything your big balls destroy.
5818240	5820200	And then they release.
5820200	5822080	Yeah, that power at the moment that they're destroyed.
5824080	5829320	But unlike in Snow Brothers, you don't get all beneficial items.
5829320	5830800	You'll get some detrimental ones,
5830800	5833840	like things that strip away your powers and stuff like that.
5835080	5838200	And then at the end of the fourth level, you have a boss fight.
5839200	5845200	And then you get these big bursts of of items released by the boss.
5846320	5851920	One of them is it looks like meat on the bone, and that is an extra life.
5851920	5856760	It only comes out with the the defeat of the boss.
5861080	5863440	But at any rate,
5863440	5866960	it's a fun game, it gets pretty challenging,
5866960	5870360	but I like the aesthetic of it, honestly, I found it
5871200	5874720	to be a lot more fun than Snow Brothers or Bubble Bobble
5875120	5878280	because it's cute, but scary.
5879200	5884200	So there's an official story that you see at the start of the game,
5884200	5887040	and I want to I want to read it, if no one minds.
5888320	5891840	Go for it. There lived one grave watcher
5892320	5896760	with magical power at a very small village in a remote region.
5897080	5901000	He lived a quiet, solitary life in the corner of the cemetery.
5901320	5905280	He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance.
5905960	5908280	Well, the village people are stupid, I'm kidding.
5908680	5913240	One day he found the graves were being ransacked and some corpses were stolen.
5913480	5915520	He didn't want the village people to find out,
5915520	5918960	so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself.
5919400	5922760	Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.
5923560	5927200	He found out that a powerful wizard has been stealing the corpses
5927200	5930280	to build his army of undead to terrorize the village.
5930720	5934640	He then took it upon himself to eliminate the wizard once and for all.
5936040	5939480	And then there's one more line that I think is from the end of the game.
5940240	5943520	After defeating the wizard, he returns to his solitary life.
5943920	5946440	Eventually, the villagers find out about his bravery
5946440	5948560	and protecting them from the menace of the wizard
5948920	5951960	and go to his house and express their gratitude to him.
5953600	5957960	And and actually, funny enough, this year,
5958840	5962880	Time Extension said that this was one of the best games ever for the Neo Geo.
5965280	5968120	There you go.
5969000	5970520	All right. It's a cute game.
5970520	5974240	I love it. It's got a cute style to it.
5974600	5977760	I like the whole like Halloween, Halloween, Snow Brothers type of thing.
5978720	5981720	Oh, yeah. That second boss, though,
5981800	5986440	it's like a giant skull on like built into a motorcycle. Mm hmm.
5987200	5988920	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
5988920	5991760	It's just that that one was a pain in the ass.
5991960	5995480	The other ones were like a cakewalk compared to that one, even the twin ones.
5996440	5998920	And I played a significant amount of this
5999280	6003080	on one of the candy cabs at California Extreme yesterday.
6004160	6006720	All right. Your classic game of the week, Nightmare in the Dark.
6006800	6010320	Let me just say, Dark Soccer, I appreciate you picking a Halloween game in August.
6010320	6013880	I really do, especially with the rumor that pumpkin spice lattes
6013880	6018120	are returning next week and fall is creeping back more and more and more.
6018120	6020520	And I, for one, could not be happier because you know what?
6020760	6023960	Christmas has been cutting into the Halloween season for far too long.
6023960	6027360	So you know what? Summer Halloween deserves this moment.
6027360	6030040	Suck it. It is now fall. Yeah.
6030640	6033280	And honestly, though, I'm just
6034720	6037200	at the grocery store.
6037200	6041160	The Starbucks brand already has their Keurig
6042800	6044280	pumpkin spice.
6044280	6048640	I posted an Instagram story this week as we were at Target
6048640	6050600	and I saw my first pumpkin spice.
6050600	6051320	It was the same thing.
6051320	6053440	It was their store brand.
6053440	6055520	I can't remember the name of it, but Target's in store brand
6056160	6059520	of the pumpkin spice decaf and gather actually good and gather
6059520	6060360	whatever it's called.
6060360	6062240	Good and plenty like the candy.
6062240	6064840	The pumpkin spice decaf as well.
6064840	6067440	So, oh, I don't usually see the fun flavors and decaf.
6067440	6068640	So had to get some of those.
6068640	6073280	So now DJ says fall is not until September 22nd.
6073280	6075040	Stay in your lane, Rob.
6075040	6076320	To that, I say suck it.
6076320	6080320	Hater, is this is the spirit store open or not open?
6080560	6081880	The spirits that go check.
6081880	6087160	Oh, not go check your local abandoned former department store.
6087240	6089680	No, we've got one right around the corner from us.
6089680	6091560	But they're not open yet.
6091560	6092680	They have the signs out.
6092680	6093960	I need to check.
6093960	6096960	So I need to check where the where the sports chalet was,
6096960	6101640	because that's where our spirit is out here by Joanne's,
6101640	6104600	which is funny to have the spirit and Joanne next to each other,
6104600	6108160	because then I can just like be everywhere I need and stock up
6108160	6111240	on future cosplay stuff and decorations for my house year round.
6111960	6114280	Alan and I are trying to figure out what we want to dress up as well.
6114280	6116040	We know what we want to dress up as for ugly.
6116040	6119440	But we want to figure out, like, should we just do the costumes in a bag
6119440	6121120	or like, how can we make it more interesting?
6121120	6124400	So it can be something that reminds me.
6124760	6127280	I've decided what my second cosplay is going to be for TwitchCon.
6127280	6130000	Hmm. Pigmeg.
6130000	6132320	Oh, pigmeg. How funny. My Meg.
6132320	6133680	You know, it's funny.
6133720	6137720	Intoxicated and I use exactly the same cosmetic for our megs.
6138960	6141720	Independently of each other.
6141720	6144000	That's funny. Are they coming again to TwitchCon?
6144560	6146240	Yeah. Fine. Yeah.
6146240	6147280	I'm not even sure.
6147280	6149560	I'm not even sure who's going to tell this year.
6149600	6151680	Oh, I know. I know.
6153120	6155520	I haven't heard of Elsie's going, which I really hope so.
6155840	6159240	But I think in a while, I think they've went on a break.
6159280	6161840	Yeah. Yeah. But I think,
6161840	6165080	well, he's living his best vtuber life.
6167080	6169360	But I know Nick is going.
6169360	6170640	Cam is going.
6170640	6172960	I think we're going to have Le Pen.
6172960	6175960	I think we're going to have has like your usual.
6176280	6178240	I think we're going to have like all the usuals.
6178240	6180880	But I think there's a few people who still aren't going to be able to make it,
6180880	6185160	because I think that that Rokum's isn't going to make it.
6185160	6186000	So I'm a little sad.
6186000	6188600	I think the Vegas hotel prices are a little off putting
6188600	6190280	for some part of the problem.
6190680	6192920	Yeah, I'm staying with Tiara.
6192920	6195240	We oh, that'll be fun.
6195240	6197000	I hope to see them at some point.
6197000	6199120	Actually, we need to like do a dinner or something.
6199120	6200880	We'll be there the day before and leave the day after.
6200880	6202960	I'd love to see Tiara.
6202960	6203720	I'll bring it up.
6203720	6206680	Yeah, we had some we had some plans to go like
6208080	6209240	go to the Pinball Museum.
6209240	6211440	So oh, fuck yeah.
6211440	6212480	Heck yeah.
6212480	6217440	Uh, God, Alan said he maybe wants to go see the RuPaul's Drag Race show again.
6217440	6218280	And I was like, really?
6218280	6219960	It wasn't that good the first time.
6219960	6224200	But I'll do I'll do things my husband wants to do because I'm nice.
6224200	6226320	Well, I wanted to what I wanted to do that I was down.
6226320	6227520	I tried to get us reservations
6227520	6229840	at the Hell Kitchen restaurant for Thursday when we get in.
6230160	6233520	And nope, if I wanted to if we wanted a reservation there,
6234120	6236360	it had to be like 11 o'clock at night.
6236360	6238200	Jeez. Yeah.
6238200	6240200	Phil of nine in chat says, was it bad, Rob?
6240200	6241280	I still need to see that.
6241280	6245000	Honestly, just go see the local queens at a show like it.
6245200	6247200	It's just it's better and more organic.
6247200	6249480	I didn't like the whole like overproducedness of it.
6249480	6254960	And I thought it was if if you like the musicals on Drag Race, you'll like it.
6255280	6259400	If you think the musicals on Drag Race are ridiculous competitions,
6259600	6261840	then like me, you're not going to like it.
6261840	6264680	So it's your taste may vary. Hmm.
6266080	6267840	Uh, Tara said definitely.
6267840	6269120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6269120	6271800	I was interacting with him on Blue Sky and kind of hinted at it.
6271800	6274280	So Phil of nine says I might go see the Drag Race show
6274280	6276120	when I go see the Kylie residency.
6276120	6277120	Kylie?
6277760	6279920	Yeah, Kylie's doing a residency at the Venetian.
6280040	6283080	Not not in October, but well, maybe, but not that weekend.
6283760	6285120	I want to go so bad.
6285120	6286920	But, you know, it's sold out like 30 minutes.
6286920	6289640	But the rumor is she's going to add more dates
6290880	6291960	in the middle of next year.
6291960	6294640	And I might do it if they add more more dates.
6294640	6296200	I might. But yeah. Oh, my God.
6296200	6300640	They they are fucking fleecing the gays for that Kylie thing
6300640	6303920	because it's like the tickets for the show and then like the
6303920	6306520	the dinner tickets and the minimum drink tickets.
6306520	6308560	It's like, oh, my God.
6308560	6311600	No, I feel at night I heard they were going to add more on top of that.
6312600	6314520	So we'll see like.
6315720	6317440	I love Kylie. I know me, too.
6317440	6319960	I'd love to go see it, but I just. Yeah.
6320280	6323200	Anyway, I had actually kind of an embarrassing moment
6323200	6327080	yesterday at the convention because I was I was, you know,
6327080	6332240	touching up my makeup and I love it was on in the background music.
6332480	6334600	And I'm singing along doing my face.
6334600	6337520	And this lady looks over is like, you love this song, don't you?
6337520	6339560	I was like, it's Kylie.
6339560	6341400	Of course, I love this song. That was it.
6341400	6342720	That was a conversation.
6342720	6346880	Every every time my friend and I go to because one of my friends
6346880	6351800	I play Overwatch with actually here locally, I will go out to the bar.
6351800	6353720	We like to go to the bolt sometimes.
6353720	6358680	And every time because he drinks, he taught me how to install
6358680	6360120	the touch to these on my phone.
6360120	6363840	So when we go, I always say, OK, I'm going to put them on.
6364320	6368080	So and usually after like three hours,
6368080	6371640	it will finally come on because gays and controlling music.
6371640	6374440	Let me tell you. Mm hmm.
6374440	6378040	All right. You know, whether that's still not even my favorite Kylie song.
6378080	6380880	No, it's not my favorite either, but it's it's so like
6381320	6383280	it's a song that is still my favorite.
6383280	6385360	You can't help but smile.
6386000	6388360	Yeah. That's the thing. And drive really fast, too. Oops.
6389240	6390960	Maybe I'm just like super contemporary,
6390960	6393560	but I really think my favorite Kylie song is Say Something.
6393600	6394920	I love that song.
6394920	6397440	Like it just it always lifts up my mood.
6397440	6400840	It has such a such a lovely musical melody to it.
6400840	6401960	And the harmonies are beautiful.
6401960	6402960	Anyway, I get it.
6402960	6405360	Anyway, next on Kylie Lounge Radio.
6406520	6409720	It sets off my synesthesia in a good way. Yes. All right.
6410360	6412880	KylieCon. Yes.
6415560	6418520	In Australia, unfortunately. All right.
6418520	6422520	Moving on, let's talk about some other news in the gaming industry
6422520	6424720	with some rapid fire news.
6424720	6427000	Loki. Yep.
6427000	6429520	So Steam Remote Play is getting an upgrade.
6429520	6433720	They're going to be enabling for case streaming now.
6433720	6435240	So that's pretty sweet.
6435240	6439320	I just grabbed the beta client of Steam to be able to try that out.
6441200	6443480	Neat. I haven't done remote play.
6444240	6447400	I have a like one of those
6447400	6448480	that's what they call it.
6448480	6451880	It's not Steam Deck, Steam Box, Steam streaming thing.
6452240	6454680	I don't know. I haven't tried that ever since they got it, but
6456000	6457120	that might be fun.
6457120	6461480	We'll see. And then there's a rumor, of course, that Keanu Reeves
6461480	6462880	is in Death Stranding 2.
6462880	6467280	This is coming from Instagram where Hideo Kojima posted a picture of
6467560	6471280	none other than Norman Reedus sitting next to Keanu Reeves.
6471280	6475680	And well, why would they be together and Hideo Kojima posting about it?
6477280	6479640	Maybe we'll have to find out, I guess.
6479640	6484120	That sounds like a Game Awards type of an announcement.
6484120	6486600	Doesn't it? Doesn't it sound like the type of thing that was arranged
6486600	6489120	backstage at the Game Awards? Like totally does.
6489920	6494320	Yeah, that that totally sounds like a thing that we'll see in a few months.
6495240	6498160	All right. Darsakra.
6498160	6502240	Well, Alan Wake News, Alan Wake 2
6502240	6505880	has been delayed by ten days.
6506000	6508560	Ten whole days. Ten whole days.
6509080	6511840	More like Alan Wait.
6512960	6515800	It will be out on October 27th.
6516280	6520840	And it's not really related to like giving them time to to, you know,
6521560	6526200	polish up the date as I think it's just the quote is saying.
6527440	6530760	That we hope this date shift gives more space
6530760	6532880	for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.
6533320	6536320	So meaning I think it's going to be to allow a buffer time
6536320	6540640	between the majority of releases to then bring out their game.
6543280	6544760	I think what
6544760	6546240	isn't that around?
6546240	6549440	Call it at ease, I think, coming out in November, unless they bumped it up
6549440	6552280	earlier, but there is some big games in October.
6552280	6554800	Yeah, it's just like Assassin's Creed or something like that.
6555240	6556080	Yeah, Assassin's Creed is.
6556080	6558280	Well, I mean, I should probably just look at the list.
6558280	6560680	It's right in front of me anyway. So that's true.
6560680	6562680	We are about to move into release dates.
6562840	6564160	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
6564160	6566480	Only a few things coming out in the 20th.
6566480	6569080	So Marvel's Spider-Man, too, and Super Mario Wonder.
6569080	6572840	Just a couple of small games, you know, like it's it's no big deal.
6572840	6574440	It's no big deal.
6574440	6576240	The Metal Gear Solid remaster.
6576240	6578120	All right. All right. All right.
6578120	6581160	But if I can finish. Sure. Please.
6582280	6585120	I know we already derailed it with Kylie, we could just talk about more Kylie.
6585920	6587680	Finish your damn story.
6587680	6592760	But the tweet from their official Twitter account,
6592760	6594840	I'm not calling it anything but Twitter.
6594840	6596920	An update from the Alan Wake 2 team.
6596920	6600520	We're moving Alan Wake 2's launch from October 17th to October 27th.
6600760	6604560	October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift.
6604560	6605720	And here's the rest of the quote.
6605720	6608200	Gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.
6608200	6612080	We can't wait to show you what everyone's favorite novelist is up to
6612080	6613960	in the dark place next week.
6613960	6616280	Thanks for your patience.
6616280	6618320	So there's going to be more news coming out.
6618320	6621480	I'll put a link to the tweet in the in the chat tweet.
6622480	6624480	All right. Tweet. Not.
6625840	6627720	Yeah, not anything else. All right.
6627720	6630280	No, I didn't hear anything. No one said anything.
6630280	6632560	Moving on to this story.
6632760	6635680	Jeff Keeley is basically saying in regards to opening night
6635680	6639720	live at Gamescom, lower your expectations.
6640040	6643080	I'm paraphrasing, but that's what I'm hearing in this whole thing is that
6643080	6645880	do not expect gigantic game announcements in this whole thing.
6646160	6648040	But maybe it's a mind trick.
6648040	6650560	Maybe he's saying that because there's going to be a big announcement.
6650560	6651680	OK, I don't think so.
6651680	6653760	Just, you know, lower the bar.
6654320	6655440	Here's what he is saying.
6655440	6660560	And this is only like two days away, actually, because it's opening night live.
6660560	6661840	But it's like 11 a.m.
6661840	6663800	for us, because obviously it's happening in Germany.
6663800	6666040	So time zones, lol.
6666040	6669840	But the event is happening on August 22nd.
6669840	6672440	And in a statement, actually, no, I'm sorry.
6672440	6674840	This was an interview with VGC.
6675320	6678760	Jeff Keeley said it's going to be an exciting show with new looks
6678760	6683240	at many announced upcoming games like Alan Wake 2 and Black Myth Wukong.
6683520	6688160	This year's ONL is less about announcing brand new projects
6688360	6692520	and more about giving fans updates on some of the biggest games
6692520	6694720	due out over the next year.
6694720	6696880	Haven't I given you nerds enough?
6697320	6700200	No, I added that last line myself, but I just I just
6700840	6702680	he should have said that.
6702680	6705120	Jeff, if you're highly hiring a publicist, I'm available.
6705120	6710800	Just saying. Anyhow, the last time I think they actually had.
6710840	6712640	Oh, the last one was in person.
6712640	6714600	So this one will also be in person.
6714600	6716720	But obviously there was there was a break there.
6716880	6720400	Last year's show was two hours and ran 35 games.
6720600	6722240	But I don't know.
6722240	6724360	They're not saying exactly how long this one is,
6724560	6729160	but I'm sure folks will be paying attention on Tuesday morning.
6729160	6731600	So we'll see if anything new maybe does get gets announced.
6731600	6732360	We'll see.
6732360	6735840	Dark Tetsuya says, I mean, I'll just be happy to get the Phantom Liberty update.
6736440	6738720	Quest Buster says, Can't wait for Phantom Liberty.
6739040	6742080	S2 100 Matt says, Here comes the Where are the new games?
6742080	6744480	Worst Gamescom ever.
6744480	6748360	Again, like you have Baldur's Gate three nerds.
6748360	6750160	What else do you fucking want this year?
6750160	6754400	Like go like literally on top of everything else.
6754880	6757240	Everything else you've been given this year.
6757240	6759720	You now have Baldur's Gate three.
6759720	6761880	Go fucking play something that already came out.
6763200	6764720	I mean, Starfield's coming out in a few weeks.
6764720	6768160	I know the early access is happening on the Dragon Con,
6768160	6771080	which I'm not paying for early access, but it's weird to me to think
6771080	6774880	when I get back from Dragon Con, which I leave for in 10 days, BT dubs,
6775440	6777760	when I get back from Dragon Con, there will be Starfield to play.
6779200	6781880	For real, finally, it's amazing.
6783040	6785760	Anyway, let's travel around the world
6785760	6788280	and check out some games that are coming out
6788280	6791640	a little sooner than October 20th as in the next week.
6791640	6793640	Loki, what's coming out in the US?
6793640	6797560	We have Fort Solace on PC, Mac and PlayStation five.

6811720	6815240	Now's the time to cash in on, you know, the Smurfs license.
6816240	6818800	Well, after any movies or anything has been never done
6818800	6822280	for the Smurfs, now is the time.

6865760	6869320	PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6870320	6873080	All right. Traveling over to Japan and looking at some releases there,
6873080	6875040	you know, we had a pretty quiet week last week
6875080	6877720	and in contrast, we have a very busy week this week.
6878000	6881720	So coming out on the switch this week, on the 24th, we have DC
6881720	6885840	three to Capo three plus story in regular and limited edition.
6886160	6889880	Shirogane Cross Spirits, also in regular and limited edition.
6890240	6894600	Caru Maruka Circle in regular and limited edition.
6895240	6897960	Killer Frequency in a multi language
6898240	6900480	supported edition comes out in Japan this week.
6900720	6905360	We have the Kemco RPG Selection volume four releases for the switch.
6906160	6909960	These come out pretty regularly with some, you know, more obscure
6909960	6912640	to the audiences over here anyway, releases.
6912840	6916200	But if you're curious, the releases in this collection are Cronus
6916200	6921840	Ark, Bonds of the Skies, Legends of the Tetrarchs and Monochrome Order.
6922160	6925160	So those are what are in the Kemco RPG Selection four.
6925640	6929640	Coffee Talk one and two gets a double pack release as well.
6929880	6935360	Tiny Troopers Global Ops, excuse me, and Unreal Life in a regular
6935360	6938320	and limited edition also comes out.
6938320	6940000	That's all on the Nintendo Switch.
6940000	6943400	If you want to go over to the PlayStation five, you can check out
6943400	6948600	Immortals of Avium is out as well as that Killer Frequency game is out as well.
6948800	6951600	Ride five is also out in Japan.
6951840	6957440	Tiny Troopers Global Ops and Fantavision 2020X
6957720	6960320	is out as well in Japan this week.
6961080	6963440	That's I'm assuming the VR game.
6963880	6967000	I didn't realize Japan did not get it at the same time as the rest of us.
6967000	6969560	But there you go. That is coming out.
6969560	6971640	It's actually really low price, too.
6971640	6974640	It's about a twenty dollar game in Japan.
6974640	6977320	So it seems kind of low, but cool.
6977760	6979360	So check that out.
6979360	6983080	Me, it doesn't say anything about it being a price reduction, but
6984600	6986560	interesting. All right.
6986600	6989000	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
6990000	6993040	A handful of things on PlayStation 20,
6993520	6996960	but on the 22nd on PlayStation, we have Smurfs Kart
6998120	6999480	for PlayStation, Xbox.
6999480	7002880	We have Immortals of Avium on the 24th.
7003080	7004240	Oh, it's a card game.
7004240	7006960	Never mind. It's just Yu-Gi-Oh block set.
7006960	7008720	Twenty fourth.
7008720	7012360	We have PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Blasphemous two
7013360	7015880	on PlayStation, Xbox, Ride five
7016280	7018360	on the twenty fifth.
7018360	7022560	We have Hitman World of Assassination on PlayStation
7023680	7026080	PlayStation, also Metal Tails Overkill
7027680	7030360	PlayStation and Switch Armored Core six
7030960	7034400	and on Switch Loop Hero.
7034400	7037600	All right. Well, we have some more news stories for you.
7037600	7041240	But before we get to those, DarkSakura, I believe at this point,
7041240	7043400	you are going to be bidding us adieu tonight.
7043840	7047000	You talked about some of your professional engagements earlier in the show.
7047000	7051000	So I think you are heading out early tonight. Yeah, I got to.
7051000	7053200	You know, it's it's work.
7053200	7056560	I have to be up at five in the morning and I got some stuff to do before bed.
7056560	7058040	So. All right.
7058040	7060280	Hey, it's money pays the bills.
7060720	7063920	But keep your eyes open in the meantime.
7065080	7066680	Peace and love.
7066680	7069280	All right. And no, no stream tonight, but we will look forward
7069280	7072800	to seeing you back here next week, right here on Tuesday for streaming.
7073120	7074720	Yeah, then I'll be, of course back.
7074720	7076520	Yes. All right. Have a good one.
7076520	7078760	I do. All right.
7078760	7080320	Let's move on with the news.
7080320	7082520	Loki, what do you have for us next?
7082520	7088400	All right. So we talked about this before, that there was some sort of deal
7088400	7092040	that fell through with Embracer Group, basically a two billion dollar deal.
7092600	7093560	Very large.
7093560	7097040	The initial assumption was, oh, this must be Sony or Microsoft
7097040	7099400	investing in the company will come to find out.
7099600	7103680	According to four anonymous sources that spoke with Axios,
7103680	7107320	it's actually this Saudi public investment fund gaming
7107320	7111320	subsidiary of Savvy Games Group that backed out.
7112080	7114800	So. I mean.
7116040	7119360	There's a whole like conflict with me, like with the Saudis
7119880	7123440	investing in gaming anyways, because of the whole, you know, way they
7123920	7127200	you know, at least their government is treating like journalists,
7127240	7129160	you know, murdering them,
7129160	7132360	probably not favorable and, you know, kind of like,
7133120	7137000	oh, hey, let's invest in these games and stuff to make our image look better.
7137000	7140800	Like, you know, I, I don't like the way that looks.
7140800	7143400	So maybe that's why it fell through. Who knows?
7143400	7147800	But, you know, they've already received one billion dollar investment
7147800	7152840	from this investment fund, apparently already from last year.
7152840	7156920	So they're just not receiving an additional two billion dollars.
7157200	7161800	All right. Yeah, I am.
7162080	7165440	This news is interesting about who left him at the altar.
7165440	7170080	But yeah, I can't say I disagree, Loki, that maybe
7170080	7172960	some of these countries are already a little too invested in gaming.
7172960	7175080	I can't say I'm
7175080	7177800	disappointed to hear that they're not going to have their,
7178240	7180920	you know, be wedged in a little more.
7182120	7185920	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the idea of them investing in other things
7185960	7190120	is part of part the image and part trying to not have all of their money
7190120	7193640	invested in oil in a world that's trying to get away from oil.
7193760	7195720	It's both. Yeah.
7195720	7198480	But obviously there's still some human rights issues
7198480	7200760	and so forth that are of a concern.
7202360	7206520	So I can't say I'm, again, sad to see them not investing.
7206520	7209440	But I know the industry, you know, and what embrace is going through
7209440	7211320	is a shitty thing to do to embrace her.
7211320	7213480	So I'm kind of curious what all happened there.
7213480	7215000	Maybe they'll make a movie about it someday.
7215000	7217200	Who knows? Maybe. Maybe.
7217200	7218760	What else do you have, Loki?
7219480	7222560	So kind of counter to what we're a little bit more in line
7222560	7224280	with what we expect from Take-Two normally.
7224280	7227640	We talked last week about how some of the roleplay mods and stuff
7227640	7232120	have been brought into and purchased by Take-Two Interactive
7232120	7236200	to kind of help support Grand Theft Auto online.
7236520	7241280	Well, now they're just back to the usual game of striking down modders,
7241760	7244000	creating mods for Grand Theft Auto five.
7244000	7247760	So this one in particular is actually an AI mod
7247760	7250600	using Eleven Labs voice technology as well.
7250880	7256240	It allows, I guess, for more custom AI.
7257480	7260200	I don't know if it's NPCs or other players, but,
7261600	7265680	you know, basically a sentient street mods, which they said
7266280	7270920	had a story that revolved around AI worshipping death cult and NPCs
7271240	7274800	whose dialogue would be randomly generated by a tool called
7274800	7276640	in world character engine.
7276640	7279520	I mean, it sounds really cool,
7280360	7284040	but it's also not unexpected that Rockstar Games would do this.
7284480	7286960	You know, hey, innovation, we can't have that.
7286960	7289560	Let's just strike that down because you're using our game.
7289960	7292200	Yeah. Well, also just make your own game.
7292200	7294080	How is this? You know, how is it?
7294080	7296560	And we've talked a little bit before about this when it comes to AI.
7296560	7298280	How is the AI learning?
7298280	7299840	You know, because if it's learning from something,
7300040	7303040	right, given permission to use, then, well,
7303040	7305960	it's probably learning from just the language models that they already have.
7305960	7306840	So it's it.
7306840	7308960	I don't think it's learning necessarily from this.
7308960	7311800	It's probably not incorporating anything from Grand Theft Auto
7311800	7313960	into how the language is generated, though.
7314480	7316480	No, I don't think so. Hmm.
7316480	7319560	Interesting. All right.
7319560	7322800	Well, something kind of lastly here tonight
7322800	7326840	before we get to our listener roundtable, something that is a little
7327400	7330440	again, it's one of those things that they probably don't have permission to do it.
7330440	7333560	But I'm not I'm not so sure they're going to get shut down for this.
7333880	7336400	This is a Twin Peaks.
7336800	7338720	You know, I love this show, by the way.
7338720	7341440	If you've never seen this show, it's an incredible TV show.
7341440	7343880	It's a little bit dated. It's from the 90s.
7343880	7347560	But Twin Peaks was a show that premiered in 1990.
7347560	7350480	If you've ever heard the whole famous like Who Killed Laura Palmer thing,
7350480	7353040	that is all from the show Twin Peaks.
7353040	7358680	And this group, the Blue Rose team, it is a French developer,
7359200	7365280	just released a demo this week for something called Twin Peaks into the night.
7365600	7369160	They've been prepping this for a little bit now, and a demo just came out.
7369360	7372640	And you can see here from the video that we're looking at on Twitch TV,
7372640	7375320	or if you go look that up here because you're listening on the podcast,
7376040	7379840	the graphics are very retro and they're very PlayStation one,
7379840	7382080	which, you know, makes sense for the time frame of the game.
7382080	7385240	Although actually in 1990, it would have been like Super Nintendo,
7385240	7387440	like maybe a 32 X game.
7387440	7390520	But that's OK, because, you know, the movie then came later and all that stuff.
7390520	7394680	But I love the look of this for, you know, what this is.
7394680	7398120	I love how they've recreated some of the imagery
7398120	7402280	from the iconic TV show into this whole thing here.
7403840	7407840	In the game, the game kind of looks like a little bit of a game
7408080	7409160	in the game.
7409160	7412320	Yeah, the game kind of has like this Resident Evil sort of look to it
7412320	7413240	that looks really good.
7413240	7415280	It kind of fits right in with that whole thing.
7415280	7418160	Oh, God, I love this whole thing of that whole scene of
7418720	7420760	Julie Cruz singing at the bar. But anyway,
7422440	7427240	there looks to be some actual video cut scenes from the show itself.
7427920	7433120	The demo has to do with events from season one where Cooper arrives in Twin Peaks
7433360	7436840	and starts looking into the murder case of Laura Palmer.
7437000	7439360	And of course, the demo has all the quirky things
7439360	7443200	and the scary things that people loved from the TV show.
7443400	7445880	The game, of course, will be free when it launches,
7445880	7448280	because they're trying to avoid any legal issues.
7449120	7453120	David Lynch, they're just kind of hoping is too busy doing his,
7453120	7458120	you know, it's Friday social media posts and whatever weather reports
7458120	7460040	he does on YouTube or whatever he's doing these days.
7460040	7462840	So hopefully he won't cause a stink.
7463360	7466320	ABC, which is technically Disney,
7466920	7468640	don't know how they're going to take to this,
7468640	7472240	but let's just kind of hope it kind of goes under their radar, shall we say?
7472560	7475760	Anyway, I think this thing looks so cool, I got to say.
7478080	7482200	It does not get into the elements of the recent Twin Peaks,
7482200	7485960	The Return, which was on Showtime a few years ago,
7485960	7489240	which was the, quote unquote, third season, which was also very good.
7489840	7492160	But this game touches none of that.
7492160	7494560	I suppose they have to save something for a potential sequel, right?
7495240	7497800	Who knows? Anyway.
7501240	7504160	That is it for all the stories that we had slotted tonight.
7505040	7506800	Comments in chat, Sjo and Hunter Matt says,
7506800	7508920	So Rob is streaming this when?
7508920	7510040	I'm tempted to.
7510040	7512040	Let's let them give it a little more polish
7512040	7514280	and then I'll probably have to stream it,
7514280	7516360	because they only have the demo right now.
7516360	7519880	So I would like to see maybe a full game if they if they even get there.
7519880	7522280	But maybe I could do the demo. We'll see.
7522280	7524640	Tiger class says a Twin Peaks video game could work
7524640	7527440	because of all the detective type things you could do to find clues and such.
7527640	7530600	It is interesting. We never got anything like that.
7530760	7533520	But again, the TV show is from like 1990.
7533680	7537680	So even though you're seeing it in a PlayStation one era game,
7537680	7542240	which would be like 96, it's it's still a little dated.
7542640	7545400	Bobby says you could play the demo and describe the references
7545400	7547120	for people who'd ever watched the TV show.
7547120	7549600	Well, maybe that would be a fun little VOG Network video at some point.
7549600	7551440	We'll see. Who knows?
7551440	7554640	So dark to see, it says someone got a C and D
7554640	7558160	copyright thing for streaming a 25 year old soap opera.
7558360	7560680	You can't even buy on DVD legally anymore.
7560680	7562560	So you never know. That's that's true.
7562560	7565080	You never know what they're going to police and what they're not.
7565800	7567040	Let's go to you all.

7599280	7600920	Dark Soccer has already left the building,
7600920	7603840	so I will be taking her role tonight and reading the emails.
7604040	7607360	But my job is very, very easy as there were no emails in the bag tonight.
7607360	7610960	So I hope we can get some next week over at participate at Orange
7610960	7615360	Lounge Radio dot com while we wait to see if there's any questions
7615360	7617600	or other roundtable topics for us.
7617600	7619640	Loki, I don't know if there's any last minute news tonight
7619640	7621320	or last minute stories, but I'll check.
7621320	7622400	No, not a thing.
7622400	7624440	I think so. I think so.
7624440	7626840	It's been I feel like it actually has been a little bit.
7626880	7628840	I mean, we've had some big stories we've talked about,
7628840	7631920	but I feel like otherwise it's a little bit slower paced than usual.
7632040	7634960	And then I remembered, oh, games comes next week.
7635360	7638640	So some folks are holding, even though Jeff Keighley is saying,
7639080	7643080	don't watch the expectation level, manage them expectations.
7643280	7645560	That doesn't mean we won't get a few big things out of it.
7645560	7649280	I'm hoping we get some updates from Konami on the Silent Hill
7649640	7651600	stuff that they showed earlier this year.
7651600	7652760	Like there's a lot.
7652760	7657760	What their Silent Hill F, Silent Hill 2 remake, Silent Hill Ascension.
7657760	7659600	There's all these Silent Hill things they announced
7659600	7661600	and we don't have a release date for anything yet.
7661600	7664120	So I'm hoping we find out that maybe one of those projects
7664120	7665800	is coming out this year.
7666400	7668880	Fun random aside.
7668880	7671520	You know, we love our Dead by Daylight here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7672040	7675560	Silent Hill kind of got their cosmetics refreshed
7675560	7679720	and technically a new character from Silent Hill is now in the game.
7679920	7683040	It's a it's a skin replacement, basically.
7683040	7686160	So kind of like how in Resident Evil, you can replace Leon
7686160	7688720	with Chris or Carlos. Well.
7689040	7691200	Cheryl, why did her name escape me from there?
7691200	7693640	Cheryl, you could replace with a lot of different characters.
7693640	7696200	This is what you could do. Lisa Garland, you can do James.
7696200	7698840	And now as of this week, you can be Maria.
7699040	7700760	Maria was added to the game this week.
7700760	7705320	So I thought that would be timed a little more with maybe some news
7705320	7707520	on the Silent Hill 2 remake, but whatever.
7708360	7709720	Maybe that's coming this week. I don't know.
7709720	7712520	Maybe they had to do it this week because the alien contents come in soon.
7712520	7714840	I don't know. So we'll see.
7714840	7716720	Yeah, Dartusi and James.
7716960	7721160	Yeah, Dartusi in chat says, I mean, our holiday is already stacked
7721360	7724440	even without anything new potentially out of Gamescom. True.
7724600	7726400	I mean, I thought maybe they would announce some stuff
7726400	7729440	for like the first part of next year, maybe. But.
7730680	7732600	It's too soon, and there's all those rumors
7732600	7735240	that Nintendo is going to make a move in the early part of next year,
7735240	7737560	so we'll see. We'll see.
7738800	7741520	All right. Well, Loki, anything else you want to talk about
7741520	7743720	before we head on out tonight?
7744360	7746640	No, I don't really have anything else other than
7747040	7749400	like I said, I'm going to be streaming this week, you know,
7750280	7752800	try to get as much streaming as I can in there.
7753200	7755560	So, you know, look for that if you want to see stuff.
7756360	7758920	What's on the screen behind me right now is Ace Race.
7758960	7760720	That's the one that's like Mario Kart.
7760720	7762920	OK, it's a lot. It's a lot of fun to play.
7762920	7766200	Like it really is. It's a movement so fast. Yeah.
7767480	7769280	So, yeah, that'll be something cool.
7769280	7773720	Hopefully they bring Ace Race to MCC Island soon because that's free
7773720	7776160	and it's kind of cool with like if it is MCC,
7776160	7779000	something you want to check out as you see islands completely free.
7779800	7783000	There's you just search it online and you can play in a lot
7783000	7783960	of the different games.
7783960	7786560	They have twists on what's actually in MCC.
7786560	7789280	It's actually harder in MCC Island.
7789520	7793000	How hard would it be for a Minecraft noob or, you know,
7793560	7796920	dirty casual like me to sign in and play one of these games?
7798560	7800320	Well, for MCC Island, completely easy.
7800320	7803240	You just set up your Minecraft client to connect to it.
7803240	7806760	They even have like an installer or like a mod list
7806760	7809240	that they'd recommend for like performance stuff.
7809240	7811000	But you don't necessarily need to do that.
7811000	7812880	Wow. It's just connecting to the server.
7812880	7817600	And then you can play in a bunch of the different games that they have there.
7817600	7820960	And you get like coins and stuff and you like skins and stuff
7820960	7822440	that you can unlock. So it's pretty cool.
7822440	7826240	Does Microsoft recognize any of this stuff with as big of a deal as it is,
7826240	7828120	or is it really just community grown?
7828120	7830040	This one's all community grown.
7830040	7831800	So it's all independent.
7832800	7833840	All right. Well, good luck to you.
7833840	7834280	We'll be watching.
7834280	7836000	Yeah, they're not going to recognize about some builds.
7836000	7837520	They're definitely not going to recognize this.
7837520	7838480	I mean, maybe they would.
7838480	7841080	I mean, this is so to go back to MCC again.
7841080	7844680	So MCC is literally something that the biggest,
7844920	7848760	absolute biggest content creators in the Minecraft space participate in.
7848760	7852160	Dream, you have all the hermit, you know, a lot of the hermit craft people,
7852160	7853920	a lot of the Empire's people.
7853920	7857400	You have all of the people on the Dream S&P type stuff.
7858080	7860640	Technoblade one, you know, he was still with us.
7861280	7865800	Lots and lots of content creators and millions of subscribers and stuff like
7865800	7869440	that's the type of audience that normally are people that participate.
7869440	7873400	So we've got some of them as trainers right now, which is cool.
7873400	7875720	So I'm looking to get some time with them.
7876240	7880080	We hung out with CPK not that long ago earlier this week,
7880360	7884680	but I haven't really been on the train server as much as I probably should.
7884680	7887920	But this week, for sure, I'm going to get time in.
7887920	7890400	S2100 Matt in chat says really happy for you, Loki.
7890400	7892720	You've worked hard on your content and it's paying off now.
7892720	7895560	Yeah, you know, I hope so. Yeah, no pressure.
7895560	7896440	We'll all be watching.
7896440	7896800	But you know what?
7896800	7898200	Just like I said, have fun with it.
7898200	7899480	Like, just go in. Yeah.
7899480	7900480	Have fun with it.
7900480	7902000	Make the connections.
7902000	7903880	Win them over with humor.
7903880	7906400	You know, you're going to you're going to be fine.
7906920	7907840	We have a good group.
7907840	7910600	We've got like Binnish is super energetic people.
7911360	7914040	You know, they're funny and they're absolutely funny.
7914040	7916760	And then, of course, Errington.
7916800	7917960	You know, it's a good group of people.
7917960	7920120	So I think we have good chemistry and I think it'll be a lot of fun.
7920880	7922600	One other question I have to ask.
7922600	7925440	What does Mrs. Loki think of this?
7925440	7927440	I just don't understand it.
7927440	7929240	You know, Minecraft stuff.
7929240	7930960	Yeah, OK, fair enough.
7930960	7934480	All right. Before we roll credits tonight,
7934480	7937080	I want to thank everybody for listening to orange on radio this week.
7937080	7938640	Thank you so much.
7938640	7940320	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the program,
7940320	7941680	tell a friend or two about the show.
7941680	7942680	Help us spread the word.
7942680	7944480	We are the show where every gamer has a voice,
7944480	7947120	but we just need more voices in the room to put out on air.
7947120	7949960	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify
7949960	7951760	or wherever it is you found this podcast.
7951760	7953360	Those go an awful long way.
7953360	7954960	So it's super appreciate that.
7954960	7957320	Obviously, a lot of fun stuff coming up in the future
7957600	7960200	with Loki's Minecraft Championship coming up this weekend.
7960360	7962960	I've got Dragon Con coming up in just over 10 days.
7963160	7964760	So very excited.
7964760	7967000	I hope to meet some of you at Dragon Con again this year.
7967000	7967640	It'll be a lot of fun.
7968640	7971800	Unfortunately, the panels have still not been released to the app.
7972400	7974560	I have a feeling
7974560	7978080	just my gut tells me some of the contingency for SAG after strike.
7978080	7981000	I think part of them really hopes they get it worked out this next week
7981240	7983280	because I think some of them are returning to the table.
7983280	7986840	So I feel like Dragon Con has like a plan A and a plan B,
7987000	7988840	and they're waiting for which button to push that.
7988840	7989840	I know I know nothing.
7989840	7991240	That's just my speculation.
7991240	7994520	But usually two weeks before the event, the app has gone live.
7994520	7995920	So we'll we'll see.
7995920	7998000	But anyway, I'm really excited about that.
7998000	8000760	Really excited to be back here again in seven days with all of you.
8001080	8003240	Let's get everybody's final thought before we wrap up for the night.
8003240	8005160	Loki, your final thought tonight?
8005160	8007240	A big week.
8008280	8009480	Yeah, my final thought.
8009480	8010480	Big two weeks.
8010480	8012160	So thank you, everybody.
8012160	8013200	Thank you so much for being here.
8013200	8014560	We'll see you again in seven days.
8014560	8016120	Thanks so much for joining us tonight.
