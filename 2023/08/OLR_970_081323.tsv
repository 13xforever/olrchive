0	13960	Devolver Digital presents Devolver Delayed! Devolver Digital delayed delights that need
13960	18280	more development. Developers decided to dedicate more days to deploying their delight. Despite
18280	22120	the delay, more days should allow for improved design and increased delight. There are a
22120	26000	lot of synonyms that start with the letter D. Hopefully decade doesn't become one of
26000	29680	the relevant ones. This is the intro brought to you by the letter D. Now it's time for
29680	33520	your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you the details of this D story
33520	36760	and the rest of the week's gaming news. Study tonight now on the show where every gamer
36760	37760	has a voice.
37760	46880	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
46880	54320	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode
54320	61920	number 970 of our show for tonight, August the 13th of 2023. Yes, we're back after an
61920	66440	unexpected two weeks. Well, one expected week off and then one unexpected week off. I'll
66440	70800	talk about that in a moment. But first, let's introduce ourselves. I am Rob Roberts. I'm
70800	75080	here every week joined by my co-hosts. Say hello first and foremost to the one and only
75080	76720	DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
76720	77720	Hi.
77720	83120	Hello. Or should I say the virtual, the V2 virtual tubing?
83120	87760	I'm actually having to fix the setting real quick. There we go. I was like leaning over
87760	90980	for some reason. You know, gravity.
90980	95280	And you can see visuals like this because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine
95280	99720	o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog
99720	103200	network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can see the visuals that go along
103200	107960	with the show. I mean, we do know we're a podcast and we make it audio only first. We
107960	112160	try very, very hard to not say things like, look at what's on the screen, you know, but
112200	116920	sometimes when there's something very much outside the ordinary, ordinary, we might stop
116920	121820	and point it out such as DarkSakura's VTuber, which I know you've used on your personal
121820	127080	streams here and there over on your Twitch channel. But I guess she's making her debut
127080	129760	on OLR tonight.
129760	136240	And this is even a new look for my VTuber because I finally got my hair right.
136240	141400	And how has the VTubing experience kind of been for those that may not know or maybe
141400	142760	understand VTubing?
143760	150760	Well, it's been interesting because it's great that I don't have to put on makeup and change
150760	158840	out of my pajamas. So my skin has benefited from it. You know, it means I don't have to
158840	166880	have my my lights on all the time, which is also good. It's a but it's been kind of interesting
166880	176320	because I don't feel like this heavy judgment for how I look, you know, it's, I mean, that's
176320	180560	kind of the thing. It's great for introverts. And while I don't really mind being being
180560	187520	on camera, I do have those days where just I hurt, you know, and I don't want to or I'm
187520	194200	having like lately I've been having dizzy spells of migraines. So I haven't really had
194200	198760	a lot of the ability to get up. This shirt is clipping. I'm going to have to fix it.
198760	206880	But anyway, but it's also taught me a bit more about texturing just in 3D anyway, which
206880	218080	I was learning a bit of how to do that when I'm working in Daz. But overall, I've really,
218080	225280	you know, I think that camo is picking up my my audio too. And I should I normally have
225280	230280	that turned off. You actually sound completely fine on my end. But I think what is happening
230280	233960	unfortunately might have a little bit of a loop situation going on. I don't know why
233960	237920	my OBS is reverting some settings, but I think what I just did will fix it. So sorry about
237920	241920	that. Thank you live chat pointing that out. Sorry, audio folks. No, you sound fine. I
241920	248880	think it's on OBS's end. And I double checked my settings are fine. But at any rate, it's
248880	255480	been an overall positive experience. And I've been able to, you know, the thing I enjoy
255480	261240	about it really is customizing my clothes. Although the boobs are kind of hard to work
261240	267840	around just the way that they they sort of bend textures over it. But I'm learning to
267840	272440	deal with it. You know, I have I have all kinds of different cute stuff. I even have
272440	279960	like my ballet day outfit, which will be seen tomorrow, where I have a bun. And I have like
279960	284920	a leotard under a big shirt. And I borrowed an image from a sticker and I'll give them
284920	292800	full credit for it. But it's it has a ballerina with her feet in fifth position, which is
292800	301400	I can't do it on the camera. But and it says I plead the fifth to I also have one that
301400	305240	says May the fourth be with you. And it's a ballerina in fourth position with a lightsaber.
305240	311640	I see. I see. All right. Yeah. Funny. Funny. Quickly, before we introduce our other co
311640	317120	host here off of YouTube for a second, I wanted to mention quickly this because this was a
317120	322320	little bit newer for a Vogue network of something trying a little bit of an experiment trying
322320	327560	to create some additional content for our website and the network outside of just Sunday
327560	332660	nights as well as our affiliate podcasts. So on Thursday, we put together a couple of
332660	337080	videos that just went out on our YouTube channel. So we are creating some content that we do
337080	342160	mean to distribute and not keep exclusive to Twitch. And in all transparency and honesty,
342160	345620	it's just an effort to try to grow our network and have more content that's available for
345620	350520	consumption out there. So Shane and I got together to talk about Final Fantasy 14 Fanfest.
350520	355680	So you can check that out over on our YouTube channel. Or if you need the links, Vogue network.com
355680	362200	is a great place to start. And then Dark Sakura and I got together to talk about the new alien
362200	366840	DLC for Dead by Daylight that's coming. Oh, yeah, we took a deep dive on that because
366840	372640	Dark Sakura has some pretty strong opinions when it comes to alien or aliens inspired
372640	380480	DLC. And this is alien. No, I know. I know. Yeah. So but obviously, a lot of it's most
380480	384000	people are fond of both the first two movies. I don't see a lot of people defending the
384000	389080	third one out there. I like I actually like the third one. I like resurrection because
389080	393560	I love Winona Ryder. And I was like, if they're not going to get Sigourney Weaver, which they
393560	397240	didn't spoil I mean, they got Ripley was not Sigourney Weaver, right? It's a it's a made
397240	400920	for TV version. But it's pretty decent. We talked we talked about this in the video.
400920	405280	We talked about this video. But I was like, if they don't get that, I hope they get Winona
405280	409000	Ryder's character call or whatever her name was from resurrection, because then we can
409000	414680	get her that one. And then we can get Joyce Byer from Stranger Things. And we'd have Winona
414680	420680	and Winona on the same team. I'd love that. If they ever get the Stranger Things license
420680	425480	back. I know but that's what I want. I want Winona on Winona action. And to answer fifth
425480	432060	James question about Jonesy. Jonesy is in the game. Yep. As making little cameos. There
432060	436840	is a locker that you can open. That's near a jump scare area. I won't spoil that too
436840	444560	much. And he runs out of the locker going. And and he's also in Ripley's loading screen.
444560	449880	And she plays with him. He comes up from behind her and weaves through her legs and she leans
449880	452640	down and gives him scritches and then he gets scared and runs off.
452640	456000	I was gonna say I didn't think the fourth movie was terrible. I'm a little fond of it
456000	459020	because it was the first one I saw in the theater and it was by that, you know, alien
459020	463240	is a big director franchise, or at least it was right. And it was the guy that did the
463240	467080	City of Lost Children directed the fourth movie. So it's got a very stylistic look to
467080	473000	it. And it was written by at the time, this person was huge, obviously, some time and
473000	477280	some looking back, there's shown that this individual is not great. But Joss Whedon wrote
477280	478280	it, you know,
478280	482480	there's more drama behind that, because they changed the script a lot. Oh, okay. I thought
482480	490000	his there are there are places in there that have a lot of his original writing. But there's
490200	496400	there was quite a bit that was changed. So where it doesn't end up as quite his style
496400	500440	of movie, if that makes sense. So anyway, there's some drama, I would encourage you
500440	504080	to check out our YouTube channel if you're not already following it at of course, vog
504080	507760	network, vog network and check out all the latest Speaking of socials real quick, and
507760	514160	then our third host is sitting there so patiently. I will mention, we are also now on blue sky.
514160	517920	So for those of you that have decided, you know what billionaire platform, not for me
517960	521880	so much. We now have a presence on blue sky as well. And I'll let you guess where you
521880	528920	can find us on blue sky. Yes, it's vog network, although the way blue sky works, you can actually
528920	534040	get verified to your particular domain. So you actually look for vog network.com on blue
534040	538560	sky. And that's how you that's that's its version of a verified account is because it's
538560	543560	verified through the actual vog network domain. So but I'm pretty sure we're the only vog
543560	549760	network on blue sky as of right now. So all right. Anyhow, they have another invite code
549760	553800	somewhere if anyone needs it. Oh, yeah, it was funny. The vog network account got an
553800	558920	invite code to maybe I shouldn't say that. But you want to know what's great, though.
558920	565520	Because I'm because I'm on an Apple silicon Mac. I can run the blue sky app on my Mac
565520	569520	so I can actually play with it from my desktop. Oh, well, they have a website too. I mean,
569520	574400	yes, I just use the website. They do but it's kind of weird to get to they're really
574400	580640	pushing the app presence. I will say though, quick pro tip on blue sky, if you want to
580640	584760	change your content filters the way you want them, and I'm just going to be straight up
584760	590320	if you want to see adult content, you can't do that on the app due to App Store restrictions
590320	596160	on all platforms, not it's just all platforms. So you want to bring it up on the web to see
596160	600760	all of the content filtering options, because by default content filtering is on. So if
600760	604000	you want to see other stuff, you can go in and face it. But if you don't want to see
604000	608060	that stuff, you can also just turn the filters on the way you want them. That's one reason
608060	614040	I like blue sky a lot is that it is very customizable. Something it has that billionaires app doesn't
614040	620460	have is custom beats, which is pretty rad too. So it's it's it's it's a neat app. I
620460	623140	like where it's going. They've had some they've had some growing pains. Not everything has
623140	628820	been sunshine and rainbows, but it's much better than the alternative, in my opinion
628820	635460	so far. So all right, uh, let's say hello as well to of course the one and only tech
635460	642420	master Loki. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm tired. Yeah, tired. Busy weekend. It's been a whole
642420	647700	busy week. I've been just doing lots of stuff. Lots of things going on. Okay, hopefully something
647700	652380	we can hear about in the future. Yep, hopefully. All right. Next week. Okay, but here's what
652740	656460	the listeners really wanted over that I should say the viewers tonight over at vog network.
656460	661620	Why in the hell do you have that game playing behind you tonight? What is that? That's that's
661620	670560	the Sega hologram time travelers or time it is a time. Yes. It is because, uh, well, we've
670560	677700	done how many shows starting to run out of games? I don't know about that. Do you know
677700	683780	how many classic games dark soccer has picked over the years? Go to the Wiki page and just
683780	689260	start going in order from what she's picked. No, I picked it because like I remembered
689260	695100	that this game existed. Thankfully, I was not smart enough to play it. So, you know,
695100	703100	I don't know that it's awful, but, um, yeah, this ties in also to my, my final episode
703140	707500	of channel 64 as well. There's time travel involved. So, okay. Okay. I see what you're
707500	713580	doing. Very, very loose like connection there. But yeah, um, I don't know. You were promoting
713580	717260	something earlier on your socials about like a tour, like you were letting people come
717260	721740	on your island. How was, how was all of that for Minecraft? Yeah, we did a world tour and
721740	726780	it's actually still up if we're going to be keeping it up for a week. Um, but yeah, our
726780	733020	tour server, um, it, we invited people on, we, well, we first did like a podcast type
733020	736920	thing talking about season two and then we invited Ray on to like a world tour, had people
736920	741860	walk around. We, uh, went and played some of the mini games that we had set up during
741860	748860	the year and stuff. And, um, we had chaos at the same time. Someone teleported every
749100	756100	single entity in the game in one spot. That was fun. We had to fix that. I was worried
756100	760580	you'd get trolls or something that would want to do. No, no, we, we set it up. I mean,
760580	765460	our community's great. Um, it's set up as a, an adventure mode world. So anybody knew
765460	771260	that comes into it, it said they can't break it. I mean, the worst they could do is maybe
771260	776060	kill the ravagers or something. It, nothing that's like unfixable and it's just temporary
776060	780780	anyways. And it's not, it's a copy of our server. It's not like actually the server
780820	786940	that we play on. So, um, yeah, they can't really hurt anything, but it's more of like
786940	791060	to get to view stuff first person because like some of the builds you don't really understand
791060	795100	until you act like screenshots don't do them justice, but when you go and see them in person,
795100	800300	like, Whoa, these are huge or like these are really cool looking. Um, so it gives a chance
800300	803720	for people to kind of explore things at their pace and then plus there's going to be a world
803720	809380	download coming out at the end of next week when we start our third season. So, um, they
809380	813140	can check it out then too. And we're still working out kinks with stuff are none of our
813140	818140	resource packs work because apparently they changed the format of those. So that's great.
818140	824140	Wish I knew that a couple versions ago. Um, and just been trying to work through like
824140	829140	updating mods and everything like the proprietary mod that I made, I updated, but then the one
829140	835340	that works with that not updated. So we had to do some crazy workarounds to get things
835340	840260	to look fine on there. But I think it might be, I think it might be fun, uh, as a deep
840260	844260	dive video sometime, Loki, if, uh, you and I are you and somebody hop on there, I've
844260	849420	just been at some point, it won't always be me. I'm doing this to get it started. And
849420	853420	then other people might go, I want to do one. And then of course, this isn't the Rob show
853420	858060	it's fog network. So, um, but I think it would be great if you and I did a deep dive and
858060	861460	you could explain it from the perspective of, I haven't touched Minecraft in like 10
861460	866260	years. Like why, you know, what is it take to do something like this? And I'm like, I
866260	867740	think that'd be a lot of fun.
867740	873020	Lots of planning and then also lots of regret and burning yourself out because you committed
873020	877540	to something that was supposed to be going to the end of the year. And then we cut it
877540	882980	short by six months. And then instead of, you know, saying, oh, I'll just do less. You
882980	888780	just decide to cram more of it in a shorter time period and then have like, you know,
888780	894100	a whole week of sleepless nights because of this and yet to be announced things I can't
894100	897980	wait to, can't wait to talk about, but I cannot about them yet.
897980	906540	I know, I know them feels bro, but we will talk about that next week and how my life
906540	915340	flip upside down would say, uh, is it is going to be an insane month. That's for sure. A
915340	917940	very emotional, insane month for sure.
918140	921820	All right. Uh, some other comments on your video game, uh, playing in the background there,
921820	926460	time travelers tonight from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, pod culture
926460	931180	suggests you could run naughty bear or Yaris if you want to do a bad game. Uh, the break man
931180	936460	saying, LOL Yaris. I don't think Loki has ever done Yaris before. I think I'm pretty sure I've
936460	942220	done Yaris. I haven't done naughty bear. Um, I, yeah, it was more of just like, I was trying to
942220	946140	think of arcade games and I'm like, well, you know, I've done all these and I couldn't think of
946140	952460	any that like were interesting to me that I haven't done before polarizing that game is like
952460	956300	the brake man says it's the worst game I've ever played. As you went on to Matt says, that game is
956300	960220	hilarious. I'm assuming in a so bad, it's good kind of way. But questmaster says that was such a
960220	965820	bold game by Sega. And if you think about it, the technology really was like, it was some,
965820	969820	that's what made it even more disappointing. Cause you're like, wow, it's a hologram game. And he
969820	974700	played like, wow, this is awful, but it looks cool. Yeah. And you look at something like
974700	978940	dragon's lair, which I would consider dragon's lair kind of like the predecessor to that,
978940	982860	which is a great game. And like the Don Bluth, you know, animations, that whole series really,
982860	987500	but with space ace and all the other stuff, uh, that was incredible. And so I feel like they were
987500	991660	trying to emulate that in the hologram space kind of with this game. And it just, it wasn't the
991660	996860	same. They should have called Don Bluth. Yeah. It's like, it's hard with like full motion games
996860	1002700	like that, where it's just like, okay, well, the, the gameplay is going to be jumping duck or left
1002700	1008780	and right. You know, it's, it's very like basic controls because they can't really change full
1008780	1013580	motion video nowadays. I mean, if you were to remake that, it would be just, you could do all
1013580	1019260	sorts of crazy stuff with that. So it's just the, it, you know, they did the best they could at the
1019260	1025900	time and it is what it is. All right. Well, uh, we're going to jump into our kickoff topic here
1025900	1029500	in a moment. I'm going to ask Loki to jump into it. Cause we usually like to try to get to gaming
1029500	1033020	right at the top of the show, but we do have a few things to catch up on. I just kind of want
1033020	1038460	to go over a few things because we haven't been here for two weeks. Um, so there's a few things
1038460	1043740	to talk about so quickly. Um, I was not here two weeks ago and this was planned because I was at
1043740	1049100	Southern fried gaming expo out in Atlanta, which was a lot of fun. Uh, basically it was a really
1049100	1056380	celebration of all different types of game forms, um, notably pinball console games, uh, classic
1056380	1061260	arcade room gaming. And, uh, it was a lot of fun. I will urge you to go check out the Bobby
1061260	1066220	black Wolf show from two weeks ago where we really took a deep dive on that. I was a surprise guest
1066220	1071420	on his show. I guess the only one to ever be in person because I was at his house literally.
1071420	1075740	Uh, so we did that show together two weeks ago. So that was a lot of fun. Um, and so we get into
1075740	1080220	a lot of the details there, but I did have a really good time at the show. Um, I, I really
1080220	1086140	wish I could justify the expense of traveling back so I could go say, yes, I'll be back next year.
1086140	1090940	I'm not going to say I'm not going to be there next year, but it's going to take a lot to get
1090940	1096220	me, you know, obviously with the, um, travel costs and all that. But if I lived in the state or I
1096220	1099900	lived in the Atlanta area, or even if I lived in Florida or something within driving range,
1099900	1104540	you bet I'd drive out and go to the show. Cause it was a fun time. You know, it was, it was that
1104540	1108860	a very similar, it was a good dragon con warmup because it had that very similar vibe of like
1109500	1115420	literally Bobby, Mrs. Black Wolf and I stayed up until 3 AM one night. I never left West coast
1115420	1122300	time pretty much. We stayed up until 3 AM one night playing a kingdom hearts, PVE card with no
1122300	1126940	dice game. Um, that was actually a lot of fun and we were having to learn the rules and everything.
1126940	1131340	And I got to play as Donald and I joked, I'm not going to heal anybody because I'm Donald.
1131340	1136220	Although the gag was, um, I actually ended up doing a lot of healing, uh, throughout the game.
1136220	1140780	And I, I feel like, I feel like you can't really do well at that game without Donald,
1140780	1144140	who was like the only one who could do direct healing. But anyway, I digress.
1144140	1147900	We had a lot of fun playing that game and kind of learning about that. I enjoyed, uh,
1147900	1151660	going through the classic game room and playing a lot of the classics. They had new tables there
1151660	1156940	too. Uh, Stern was in full force. They were showing off their new venom table. I didn't,
1156940	1162380	I didn't love the venom table. I think the venom table is probably great for people who love the
1162380	1167740	classics because it doesn't have as many bells and whistles. Like there's no, like there's no
1167740	1171980	third flipper on the venom table, which for some people are going to be like, good. That's how
1171980	1176380	pinball should be. Um, and that's, they'll like that table, but I liked the Foo Fighters table,
1176380	1180700	which I'd played before, but for the first time I got to play the double O seven, uh, table,
1180700	1184780	which is in two flavors, depending on which edition of the game it is. But I love the, um,
1184780	1189340	no one lives forever with a little, uh, James Bond and the helicopter pack that's around.
1189340	1193420	I thought that was so cool. So I love that. And they had the weird Al table, Dark Sakura,
1193420	1199420	uh, with the, and they had it flipped out. So do I. I know, right. I heard about that,
1199420	1203900	but they had one that was flipped out. Cause that pinball maker lets you flip out like the back
1204460	1208060	and for like another game. And so they were showing another game with that as well,
1208060	1212300	which I thought was pretty cool. Um, and then of course all the classics as well. Uh, I know I
1212300	1216380	played a space Harrier machine and I took a picture and send it to dark soccer and I put, look,
1216380	1221820	I'm entering the fantasy zone and getting ready. Get ready. That's right. So I played that, um,
1222460	1227180	uh, just, yeah, I played some really cool indie games. They had a little indie showcase,
1227180	1231100	but there was just some fun stuff that was being shown. I really hope there's some stuff that gets
1231100	1235660	to publishing and all of that. It was really good. I love the vintage computing expo and getting to
1235660	1241420	see like the old three 86 and four 86 computers that were playing doom, uh, and that were all land
1241420	1245500	together. So you can, and what was neat about it was that it was really kids sitting down and
1245500	1252300	playing it and, uh, playing those. So yeah, just lots of fun stuff to see just a real celebration
1252300	1257980	of gaming. Uh, and I had a lot of fun. Again, we have a very, very, very similar show out here
1257980	1262540	called California extreme, but I will say, and granted, I haven't been to California extreme in
1262540	1266140	a few years, Jamie, you've been more recently than I have. So correct me if I'm wrong, but
1266140	1271660	California extreme really focuses on the pinball and the classic games. I don't remember as much
1271660	1278060	board game stuff and like Pathfinder and things of that sort. The pinball stuff has actually gotten
1278060	1285020	bigger over time and they do. And they do also have the, um, the candy cabs with, uh,
1285660	1290940	the bullet hell games. Oh yeah. There were some of those that, um, Southern fried too, but yeah,
1290940	1295660	I just, the game room was definitely like bigger at California extreme. Like there was more variety,
1295660	1298940	but I don't want to pit the shows against each other. They're both a lot of fun.
1298940	1302460	They're just, there's subtle differences between them and that's okay. You want to see shows grow
1302460	1307100	into their own thing. So I just, I found Southern fried to be like a big like celebration of gaming
1307100	1311180	and yeah, I definitely encourage those in the Southeast part of the country to, uh,
1311180	1315980	put it on your agenda to go next year. Uh, I'm sure Bobby Black Wolf will be back as far as me.
1315980	1320220	I'm a question mark until I know what my finances and all that look like for next year and what I
1320220	1326460	may or may not get offered to do. We'll see. Um, now unexpectedly we weren't here last week
1326460	1333420	and that was pretty much the situation on my end. Um, my dad had to go to the emergency room on
1333420	1338060	Saturday and when we took them into the emergency room, it was pretty, it was sounding pretty
1338060	1341820	serious. The doctors were diagnosing him with sepsis when he first went in. Unfortunately,
1341820	1346700	he had an infection that got a little bit out of control, which was weird because he wasn't like
1346700	1350940	showing signs of something that was like completely out of control until, you know,
1350940	1354540	it was too late, so to speak, but I'm going to just fast forward to the end of this.
1354540	1359420	He's fine. Now the sepsis was not that they kind of caught it like right on the borderline
1359420	1364460	and were able to pump them full of antibiotics as one does. And, you know, my dad's 84. Like
1364460	1369900	he just, he, you know, you get infections easier at that age. He had had a procedure done. Um,
1369900	1374380	and I'm just going to say in a personal area, and that's why I'm not giving details because this is
1374380	1380460	my dad's business. He had a procedure done and unfortunately it let it potentially led to this
1380460	1385900	infection by, you know, um, dislodging things or, you know, whatever, just the way these things
1385900	1389420	happen. He didn't, you know, and my dad is still a little bit stubborn in his old age,
1389420	1393820	so he doesn't like to speak up that something's wrong until something's really wrong. And, uh,
1393820	1398540	so we took him into the ER and there was that. So I wasn't sure if he was going to get discharged
1398540	1402940	on Sunday or what was going on. So I kind of told my co-host like, Hey, I don't know what's
1402940	1408940	going to happen today. And so we just kind of decided, you know what, no show. And honestly,
1408940	1414380	I ended up appreciating just like having a weekend because my Saturday and Sunday morning
1414380	1419340	had been completely shot by everything that was going on. Understandably. So I would do it again
1419340	1424460	if I needed to, but I like to be able to take Sunday night to just like do me and decompress.
1424460	1429740	Decompression. Yeah. Well, and Rob, I have to, I have to say that when you said sepsis,
1430620	1437500	I got intensely worried. No, I saw what you got worried, but yeah, I get it. Yeah.
1437500	1441900	You know, that's what, that's what got Barbara. Yeah. Uh, it's, it's no joke.
1441900	1448860	Right after having started chemo. Yeah. That's why anybody, if, if you've had surgery at any
1448860	1455980	point in the last, I'd say year, two years, and you're feeling like you're, you're starting to
1455980	1461580	feel feverish, you're feeling really exhausted. You're feeling, um, I'm trying to think of what
1461580	1467260	some of the other ones are, uh, like you don't have an appetite, um, guessing the moment that starts
1467260	1472140	getting. If you are 84 years old or really at any age, you really should have a working
1472140	1478300	thermometer at home, which I won't get into. And if showed, if said thermometer shows that
1478300	1485740	your temperature is 102.9 degrees, you probably should go to the ER. I'm not a medical professional
1485740	1490620	and I'm not here to give advice. However, I can just share my personal experiences with all of
1490620	1496860	you. Again, the good news is he's fine and he's back to his old stubborn self. So, um, but now,
1497020	1501820	he gets some free nurse visits to come check up on him, uh, and all that good stuff for a little bit.
1501820	1507420	So, um, that's also quite welcome right now. So anyway, if you need someone to get fussy,
1507420	1514220	you just tell me, I got it. I'm around enough fussy people in my family. So yes, he's at home.
1514220	1518220	He's okay. He might even be watching this right now. In which case, sorry, dad, I'm spilling all
1518220	1522540	your business, but the listeners want to know, and I hope you see all the love for you in the
1522540	1526700	chat right now. My dad does sometimes lurk in here, just so you know, he's, he's seen the show
1526700	1532380	and he asks about both of you. Um, so I haven't seen your dad since he drove us to the airport
1532380	1539900	that time to go to packs. Yeah. And, and we took a really crazy long route.
1541180	1546140	He, he does ask about you cause he'll go, how's your friend that works at place you work and
1546140	1550700	he'll like, yeah, he'll, he'll always ask me that. So he, he knows who you are for sure.
1551660	1558300	Well, well tell him, tell him I'm doing fine and that I was very, very concerned for him. So yeah.
1558860	1563580	Yeah. But, but no, I have to say hi to your dad sometime.
1563580	1569740	Absolutely. I'm sure he'd welcome that. Um, so, uh, anyway, so, so that's what happened last week.
1569740	1575500	So, you know, I hate to miss two in a row, but, and then here's the real kicker earlier today,
1575580	1580940	our power went off at noon and I got an automated message from our fiber internet provider that
1580940	1586140	says your internet is estimated to be down for nine to 10 hours. And I sent a message
1586140	1591340	via cell phone or I was like, Oh my fucking God, am I going to get screwed again? You've got to
1591340	1597260	be shitting me. Like, what did we say on the last episode to piss off the cosmos? Like my God, but
1597260	1601100	obviously we're here. Uh, the internet came back when the power did, but that was still a little
1601100	1607180	bit scary for sure. All right. And they, thank you. Thank you for the understanding in chat.
1607180	1612460	I know this is me when I say, I say, I hate missing two in a row because I know that being
1612460	1618140	a regular is not a great thing for podcasting and broadcasting all that. But I, so I appreciate all
1618140	1623180	of you that are still here on the tangent train. Uh, even after two missed episodes,
1623180	1628140	speaking of missed episodes, we won't be here labor day weekend as is tradition because I'm
1628140	1635420	going back, back, back again to Atlanta to go to dragon con. Um, I, um, I'm going to be hosting
1635420	1639820	some panels again at dragon con this year. I'm not ready to talk about them tonight because
1639820	1646940	I'm very superstitious. And, um, I, I, I don't believe anything until I see it printed in the
1646940	1653420	book or in this case published to the program, but I will say I'm potentially going to have the
1653420	1658940	biggest panel I've had. Uh, and I will say it's with a voice actor, Loki. I see you nodding cause
1658940	1663900	I may have spilled the beans before the show. It's, it's a, it's a voice actor. Um, and it
1663900	1669100	could be the biggest panel I've done and I'm really excited about it. Uh, so not just for that,
1669100	1676460	but just like who it is, uh, is a huge resume. Uh, and I'm just, I'm really stinking excited
1676460	1680140	about it. So stay tuned for next week. I can't wait to spill the beans on that. Cause I'm hoping
1680140	1684460	the app was supposed to go live already and technically the app went live, but it went live
1684460	1689660	with fake data. So when it goes live with real data, I will be happy to share all of the details
1689660	1695500	on that. So check that out. Um, one other thing I want to say, and then we can get into this week's
1695500	1700540	gaming news, but this is important too. I just want to take to, uh, take a moment to acknowledge
1700540	1708620	and send thoughts and are just, uh, aching hearts to the people affected by the fires and Maui,
1708620	1713980	um, over in Lahaina, which is a place I've been to several times. Actually. I went once when I
1713980	1719340	was younger. Uh, and then I went there on a very important trip when I saw my friend get married
1719340	1725260	out there in 2009. And this was the year before I met Alan and the year after I broke up with my
1725260	1730780	ex. And so that trip was kind of a trip that I did by myself to go to a wedding. And I actually
1730780	1735340	drove up to Lahaina and I spent the day there. And I remember shopping there. I ate at the
1735340	1741260	hard rock there, which actually closed down, I think in 2017, but I have, I saw the tree
1741260	1744780	there that everybody's been talking about this week and so forth. And I have a lot of fond memories
1744780	1751580	of Lahaina. And so to see what has happened there has just, it's absolutely broken my heart. Um,
1751580	1758380	and so it's just, I just want to acknowledge and say my heart and my, I'm so sorry to everybody
1758380	1762140	that's, that's going through that. It's, it's just, it's awful. It's awful, awful, awful.
1762780	1767660	I read a very interesting story though, about that, where there was a couple that was like
1767660	1771740	stuck in the middle of town with fire all around them. Like they, they would have died.
1772460	1778700	Um, but they had like the, the, the Apple emergency thing that contacted, that does
1778700	1784940	cellular emergency, not cellular, but, uh, satellite emergency. And they were able to,
1785580	1790860	through text messages, direct the rescue crew to where they were and got them out of there.
1790860	1794380	That's really impressive that they were able to get in there through that fire,
1794380	1797660	because it sounds like that fire was moving fast and it was just so they,
1797660	1801900	they're very, I'm very happy to hear that they were very lucky, but as we know, there are,
1801900	1806460	I think 95 people and counting. I don't remember the number because unfortunately it keeps going
1806460	1810220	up. And that that's the part that's even more painful to hear about, um, that are,
1810220	1815980	that are going through that. So, um, I, I, one of the tech sites. Yeah. I, I urge you,
1815980	1821500	if you have, um, the money available, please donate to a, uh, reputable charity.
1821500	1826220	Please be careful. There are, um, people out there that unfortunately try to profit off of
1826220	1830700	these types of situations. Please do. I'm not going to tell you who to donate to. There's
1830700	1834140	many choices out there, but please do just a little bit of research and make sure that
1834140	1839180	you're donating to a reputable and respectable organization. But there are many out there helping
1839180	1843980	with the situation that's going on in Maui. Um, the red cross might be a great place to start,
1843980	1847820	you know, but again, I'm going to leave it up to you and your decision, uh, with that.
1847820	1851020	But I just want to acknowledge and just, you know, that just, I'm so,
1851660	1856700	I wanted to take Alan there someday and now, you know, I mean, obviously they will rebuild it,
1856700	1860780	um, but it won't be, it won't be the same, you know, it's, it's still really sad to hear about
1860780	1865420	it and it's, it's going to have this history kind of hanging over it, which is really, it's just,
1865420	1871820	which is, is just so sad to think about. So anyway. Yeah. I found, um, a link to it on,
1872060	1877980	Gizmodo. So awesome. So I put it in the chat for people, um, as to show on how to Matt says my dad
1877980	1882620	was out there and stayed in that same town last month. Yeah. There's, I mean, there's Lahaina is
1882620	1887500	one of the big towns there's, um, on the other side of the Island is Hana. And there that's
1887500	1891980	a very special thing because you got to go, that's the windy roads. It's very famous. So Hana is like
1891980	1895820	way on the other side of the Island. Kihei is where I stayed when I went. And that's like the
1895820	1902860	other big tourist areas. Kihei. So, um, yeah, but Lahaina is, you know, obviously huge tourist town
1902860	1906140	is just, yeah. Tragic. Um, as you don't have to Matt says, my dad was out there and stayed in that
1906140	1910780	same town last month. So sad about what happened there feeling for the locals who had businesses
1910780	1915420	there for ages. And there was a lot of that. Like I, I talked about the hard rock, but there was a
1915420	1919500	lot of, you know, family owned, but I went into an independent clothing shop and I will never forget
1919500	1923900	the story of the rest of my life because the person was so excited to tell me, you know,
1924540	1928780	Britney Spears was here shopping last week and I had that moment of, Oh,
1929420	1940060	I'm standing on Holy ground right now. So, but, but to think that that shop is like 99%
1940060	1944140	likely gone at this point, just, it breaks my heart. Cause that was a family and independent,
1944140	1947900	um, you know, type of place. So anyway, I just wanted to acknowledge that before we got into
1947900	1953100	the fun video games stuff. Um, and just, you know, I, I don't think we have any listeners impacted
1953100	1958300	by that, but by golly, if we do, um, my heart goes out to you and your family. And, you know,
1958300	1961980	I'm sure many, some of you out there probably have family members who were, so just, you know,
1961980	1967420	our hearts going out to you. Okay. Let's shift gears. We got some gaming news to talk about this
1967420	1972380	week. Let's start it off a kickoff topic for the first time in a few weeks. Loki what's our big
1972380	1981500	first story tonight? Uh, it is a remake of wipeout being done by an individual Dominic. Uh, I'm not
1981500	1989740	going to try to butcher this, uh, we'll just go by his name, uh, Phobos lab. And, um, they are,
1989740	1996460	I'm going to guess Zabel Zebelsky, Zebelsky, Dominic Zebelsky. Okay. We're going to go with
1996460	2001260	that. That's cool. I didn't want to butcher it too many constants in there. Um, anyways,
2001260	2010860	so it is a remake, uh, wipeout, and this was kind of a hobby project being done using the leaked,
2010860	2019420	uh, source code that came out back in 2022. Um, that was from the PlayStation and then, uh,
2019420	2027180	Dean threw all that basically to rewrite the entire thing from scratch. And because apparently
2027180	2031580	the way they described it, that it was a mess, it was basically a bunch of different versions
2031580	2038220	of the game kind of layered on top of each other. And so they had to completely gut everything and
2038220	2044140	rewrite the engine and all that so that it would work and compile to, you know, modern PCs.
2045260	2051260	And it looks cool and you can play it in your web browser, which is pretty nice. If you go to
2051260	2059100	phoboslab.org slash wipe game, you can play the original wipeout. There's apparently also some
2059100	2064860	other versions that are being made with the source code as well. Wipeout phantom edition is supposed
2064860	2072060	to take the original game and also add features to it. Whereas this one is mostly just a remake
2072060	2078860	of the original game. Now I find interesting about this kinda that he doesn't seem to give
2078860	2082540	a shit what Sony thinks about this, which is what I kind of find to be the interesting element,
2082540	2086460	especially considering as you talked about this, this kind of is born of leaked source code.
2086460	2093660	This seems especially, um, bold we'll say, right. Cause he's, he basically said that there's,
2093660	2098140	you know, either let it be or shut this thing down and get a real remaster going.
2099020	2107340	This is basically, there's no way to play the original wipeouts on any modern hardware.
2107340	2114620	It's only available. They have the wipeout Omega collection. Um, and you know, I guess you can
2114620	2119180	emulate old, you know, PlayStation games through like, you know, PlayStation now or something like
2119180	2124460	that, but there's not, there's no way to play wipeout on any of those apparently. Right. Well,
2124460	2129740	I guess the Omega collection, you have that, but it's not really the original game, I guess.
2130620	2134140	I just want to acknowledge real quick, sorry, in chat, they're talking that Omega Loki came out
2134140	2138780	there for a minute and you'll hear that on the podcast. I switched scenes in OBS. And for some
2138780	2144220	reason, all of my audio settings have reverted across the board. And I have like some looping
2144220	2148060	audio, which is what you really heard there. If I don't shut it off. So for some reason,
2148060	2152540	all of those unmuted themselves. So sorry about that. I'm just really a robot. It's fine.
2152540	2156700	Everything's broken after two weeks of no show. So sorry about if you just heard that on the
2156700	2161820	podcast feed. It was not you. It's on our end and don't disappear for two weeks because everything
2161820	2167980	breaks when you're gone. Just putting that out there. Yeah. Um, yeah. So basically it's just
2167980	2173660	kind of not really worried about it because he considers it abandoned where as well,
2173660	2177900	especially like the PC version of it, you know, that was from like Windows 95 era
2178460	2181020	and stuff like that. So, um,
2182540	2186700	you know, yeah. Interesting. Interesting comment from Y Y R who's in our chat. Hello. Hello.
2186700	2191740	Saying what we need now is wipe out Omega collection for PSVR too. Unfortunately,
2191740	2195900	that's probably never happening because the dev was shut down. I wonder if that's
2195900	2199900	potentially what's causing the legal end of this to be a little slow too. I'm not sure.
2200700	2204780	I mean, I know Sony isn't as litigious as Nintendo, but I still,
2204780	2210460	I still don't believe zero GX or something like that. They'd be like, I know I still,
2210460	2213500	I still have a hard time believing Sony is going to let this stay up. I just think they move a
2213500	2219580	little slower. That's all probably. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. I thought I saw
2219580	2223180	an article somewhere too along these same lines. Cause I want to bring it up that somebody was
2223180	2228220	trying to recreate PlayStation home and it was a very similar type of thing where they were just
2229100	2232060	talking about that a while ago. Yeah. They were doing it in the, yeah, that's right.
2232060	2235660	It did come up in the show and they were doing that kind of in the face of Sony too, where it's
2235660	2241500	like either, either make a new one or shut this down. You know what? Cowards. Yeah. It's just,
2241500	2245420	yeah. It's very interesting. Interesting how people want to fight Sony.
2247580	2251580	I mean what they've done with the Spiderman license and everything. I can see the reasons
2251580	2256300	behind wanting to take up arms against them. Wipe out such a fun game though. I'm glad,
2256860	2260860	I'm glad it's. Make a new wipe out. I mean, come on, what's stopping you?
2260860	2267980	I'd love that. I, there is one of the wipe out games is in the PlayStation plus library.
2267980	2272460	I'm pretty sure. I don't think it's the original original is one of the other ones is maybe the
2272460	2277100	one they did on PSP. I can't remember, but I feel like one of them is available there. So.
2278140	2281820	Yeah. So they described it like the source of the leak or whatever they said the quality of
2281820	2288220	the leak source is abysmal. It says it contains the Wipeout ATI 3D Rage Edition.
2289340	2295980	And it was, I guess, something that they said they bundled with ATI GPUs and had versions of
2295980	2301740	the game or parts of the game from like Wipeout PlayStation and the Windows 95 version, also a
2301740	2307660	Wipeout 98 directory. That was the one that they compiled in the ATI Rage Edition. They're saying
2307660	2313180	there's some other stuff talking about how the game had been modified to work with the PAL
2313180	2318140	versions, you know, changing the physics calculations for, you know, PAL regions. So
2318140	2326540	25 FPS instead of locked to 30. Yeah, it's an interesting story. If you go to Phoboslab.org,
2326540	2331180	though, they have a whole blog post talking about the entire rewrite and all the like
2331260	2338220	stuff that they had to do. And many, many times mentioning how awful the code was,
2338220	2344460	which I think is pretty funny. Some comments in chat, Tiger Claw is saying a new Wipeout in 4K
2344460	2348460	should be the ultimate version that has all tracks from the previous games. And it needs a kick ass
2348460	2351820	techno soundtrack. Well, of course, you need to kick ass techno soundtrack. Yeah, you don't have
2351820	2356460	a futuristic race. I would just buy it for the soundtrack. But the compilation that was kind of
2356460	2362540	the Omega collection was kind of that. So really just do it. upscale the Omega collection. Like
2362540	2367420	just I'm just thinking like how good that would be now with a PlayStation five and stuff like that.
2367420	2374060	You could totally do it for exactly I mean, like you could push it that much more and it would
2374060	2380460	just be so amazing. And then put it in VR and it would be just do it. I mean, come on. Well, and
2380460	2385500	then you know, and then since you're Sony, you can just spin it off into a movie and people would
2385500	2390780	watch that too. I mean, Gran Turismo gets a movie. Why we are in chat says I do have to say Wipeout
2390780	2396140	Omega collection on PS VR one is probably the most intense thing I've ever experienced in VR
2396140	2400220	so much so that I could only handle one race. I had to take the goggles off, catch my breath
2400220	2404860	and balance then quit. It was nuts. I don't think I got around to playing that in VR. But I know
2404860	2408700	because they went back and patched it in at some point, but I can imagine it's a pretty intense
2408700	2415820	experience and how fast that game moves. So neat. All right. Let's move on and talk about the types
2415820	2419340	of games that we've been playing this week. I'd be curious if anyone's been playing Wipeout.
2419980	2423980	Let's do how was your gaming week and go around and see what folks have been playing. Dark Sakura,
2423980	2429900	how about you? How was your gaming week? I played of course Dead by Daylight with
2429900	2442220	Shayla here, of course, who is the killer whisperer, I guess. I have played Live Alive.
2442220	2450220	I finished the mecha character. I finished that story yesterday. I kept wanting to sing
2450220	2457900	along with the giant robot music. It was fantastic. I've only got, I think, three scenarios
2457900	2464540	left to do before doing the big end game scenario. What else? Oh, yeah. I started Disney
2464540	2469500	Dreamlight Valley. I will be playing it again tomorrow night after ballet because it's chill
2469500	2474940	vibes. It makes me happy. I saw you playing that a little bit. Although I'm annoyed at the fishing
2474940	2480460	part. It's like, why does Mickey have to come watch me fish? Piss off, Merlin. I always want to fish
2480460	2489820	by myself. Like when, wow, when I fish and no one bugged me. But anyway. Oh, you're very welcome,
2489820	2494940	Jim Sally. Jim Sally has been a regular visitor in my channel and I've been super happy.
2496060	2499660	I was lurking a little bit this week and I saw Jim Sally in there and I wanted to go say hi,
2499660	2502700	but I was on, I didn't have my keyboard. So it was on the TV.
2502700	2508940	Yeah. Okay. I actually have like a small TV keyboard, like a Bluetooth keyboard that I
2509020	2513740	could give you. Uh, maybe we'll see. Yeah. Cause I can always hook that up to Xbox. Yeah.
2513740	2520940	I can find it. Um, so I also, uh, played, uh, what else? Video game did I play?
2520940	2524460	I was going to say quickly on the farming thing. I'm sorry. I just want to point this out. And I'm
2524460	2529100	curious if this has ended up on your radar, but this, this game just exploded on Twitch
2529100	2532700	this week. I feel like, or maybe in the last two weeks, because it, yes. You knew where I was
2532700	2539820	going. Polia. What, what, what's your take on that? Well, I can't play it until, well, unless
2539820	2544780	there's an app, a Mac version I have to find out. Um, and I got a link from a friend to,
2544780	2550460	to join in on the beta there. Um, but I watched, uh, my friend, uh, Raven McPherson play it last
2550460	2555820	night and it is pretty chill vibes. I was, I was pretty down for it and I think, uh,
2556460	2562460	I would enjoy it. Um, although I'm still waiting for the Activision sale to finish. So that
2562460	2569020	dude is gone and I can play well again. Um, but, Oh yeah. I remember what else I played last night.
2569020	2574060	Um, uh, last week I played over the past two weeks. Sorry. I played a GQ. Oh, she buried
2574060	2581100	Parodius for a super Famicom. And I played some of gone. I played some final fight guy.
2582060	2590140	Um, play a little bit of F zero. Um, I played a little bit of, uh, Rondo of blood for PC engine.
2591020	2597660	Um, I played some Saturn stuff because I was testing out my Saturn thing. Um, radiant silver
2597660	2605100	gun. Um, and, uh, what was the other Saturday, Saturday when I was playing, uh, gun bird,
2605100	2614860	a little bit of gun bird. So that was, that, that, that was it. Oh, and I do now have my, um, copy
2615580	2620380	of robot Monday. And I'm going to be playing this shit out of that. Oh yeah. I also played
2620380	2628380	Strider too. That's a lot of game, but there's the cherry on top, the cherry, you know what the
2628380	2637980	cherry is. I hinted at it earlier. We have weird Al in my house. We have weird Al's museum of modern
2637980	2644300	hilarity. And my first game of it, I get over 3 million and it doesn't put me on the board.
2644380	2649100	I beat Dan. And then since then I haven't been able to top 1 million. It's like, what is it game?
2649100	2654540	Why are you mean to me? But it's tons and tons and tons. I have beginner's luck on tables,
2654540	2658380	like where I have a really good run the first, just ask Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, on the tables
2658380	2662780	in his basement. I had such a, and I can, I can't duplicate it after that first run. It's wild.
2663660	2667580	It's it's crazy though. Cause the, the table, cause it's one of those P three tables, which
2667580	2676460	are the modular ones. It's tall. Like I have to get, you know, those aerobic steps that you do,
2676460	2681180	like step up and they're stackable. I have one of those now so that I am the right height to
2681180	2691740	play weird Al. It is that much taller than me and well, taller than my capacity to play it.
2691740	2699740	And it's just, I mean, but it's so much fun and there's so many little things in there
2699740	2704140	and I'm learning new things in the game. And I found the supply closet and, and
2706140	2712300	Harvey, the wonder hamster is my nemesis. Cause like I always play worse when I'm trying to hit
2712300	2720940	the target for Harvey and yeah. All right. It's great. All right. Well, let's move on
2721020	2725740	for Loki and his gaming week. It's been mostly editing,
2725740	2731500	actually editing video, but Minecraft. Yeah. We did the world tour today. And of course,
2733340	2740380	lots of editing still. And I did play one other game though, because we were doing kind of just
2740380	2748540	in our discord and stuff hanging out. And so we popped in a Jack box and I played a little bit of
2748540	2757100	trivia murder party too. I almost won. I was this close, this close, but that was fun. And also I
2757100	2762860	was spectating the t-shirt dojo one or something like that. I don't remember what it's called,
2762860	2766060	but I think there's a new Jack box game coming out pretty soon here. So
2766940	2770940	cranking out one of those every year, but for good reason, they're always a lot of fun. They're very
2770940	2777420	successful party games. So yeah, they're very fun. Okay. My gaming week. So I pretty much talked
2777420	2781020	already about Southern fried gaming expo, which is, I played a variety of games. They're really
2781020	2785180	too many for me to go back in name, but what I can't, I will say though, since I see you all
2785180	2789420	talking about the money games and music games and chat, I did leave this part out on accident,
2789420	2795420	but there was the whole back of the room was lined up with music machines and they were busy
2795420	2799660	all the time. Like I, I didn't really want to like wait around a long time. And I was like,
2799660	2803980	Oh, I'll get on there when nobody's on it at California extreme. That's how it is at
2803980	2809900	California. Oh yeah. Oh, I'm sure busy the entire time. And I, I didn't really want to
2809900	2814540	embarrass myself with my skill on those anyway, but it was fun, but they didn't have a 2DX machine.
2814540	2817260	Unfortunately, that was the one I would have played if they had, but they had like pop them
2817260	2821660	because they had all the others. They had the one that looks like keyboard mania, the newer one.
2821660	2824540	And I was like, Ooh, I want to play that, but it was, it was crowded the entire time.
2825100	2832300	Um, so yeah, they, you know, good times, but, um, after Southern fried,
2832300	2837900	I stayed one more night at black Wolf Manor because, um, I was flying home the next day
2838460	2842780	and thank you in nostalgia. That was the game. Thanks. Start to Tia. That was, that was the game.
2842780	2847180	Um, because I was flying home the next day, I was staying the night at black Wolf Manor and
2847180	2853340	he has PlayStation VR too, which we've talked a lot about on this show, but I have yet to try it.
2853340	2860220	So he actually had me try it out. And I actually, uh, I played a little bit of the horizon, uh,
2860220	2866140	game that's on the PSVR and he first put it into a mode that was very interesting. It was like an
2866140	2871020	on rails kind of mode where it was really just an experience. It honest to God felt like I was on
2871020	2876780	jungle cruise without the puns. Um, well, that's the best part. That is the best part, but this,
2876780	2879980	you know, this had a jump scare at the end and all this stuff. And it was,
2880540	2886620	it was neat. Um, you know, just like how well it responded to you and some of like the haptic,
2886620	2891660	you know, stuff that was going on. It was, um, it was cool. Like I, I get why, you know, it's,
2891660	2898060	it's a better piece of technology than the first VR. I just wish the must have game was on there.
2898060	2902380	Cause I did, I did futs around with like, there's like a special gaming mode and it was kind of
2902380	2906460	interesting. Like you'd have to do the whole, like reaching behind you to grab an arrow and
2906460	2910300	like shoot an arrow like that. And it was, it was kind of neat. Like I actually got kind of
2910300	2916940	a workout playing it, but like, you know, again, it kind of suffered from that Nintendo Wii mini
2916940	2922460	game collection syndrome, um, type of thing. And I understand I was only seeing certain modes or
2922460	2928460	whatever, but I still, I still don't see myself paying the amount of money that it takes to get
2928460	2936780	PlayStation VR two and this just to have this game. I, I don't really see that happening. Um,
2936780	2942220	and again, you know, a lot of the things that are on the PlayStation VR two, uh, are kind of a lot
2942220	2948540	of rehashes of what was on VR one. So I, again, I'm not sure that, yeah. And Bobby even agrees
2948540	2952220	with me that the software isn't there to justify it yet. And that's the thing I worry about for
2952220	2959340	the PlayStation VR two, but I will say the tech is great. So I hope, you know, I hope maybe next
2959340	2964140	year they can get some big titles to really justify the purchase of the VR two. Cause I'd
2964140	2972060	love to get one. What I loved most about it in this mode I was playing. I did not have to stand
2972060	2978220	up and move around. It lets you play just sitting there on the couch or in, you know, black Wolf
2978300	2985660	Manor. It's like, you know, movie sofa type of things. Um, I could sit on that and play the game
2985660	2991660	and have a good experience without the massive amounts of movement that older VR kind of usually
2991660	2997980	goes for. And I think that's a good thing for VR as well is that sometimes you just, sometimes you
2997980	3004380	just want to VR and chill, meaning sit down and play. And yeah, everything I did in the, um,
3004380	3010460	horizon game that I played was sitting down. Um, yeah, black will says they prefer you to stand
3010460	3014460	up and play, but they give a seated option. Good. Cause I liked the seated option and I don't feel
3014460	3019020	like it took anything away from the experience to be honest. So that was that. Oh yeah. Bobby
3019020	3024620	brings up the eye tracking that that feature was a little weird to me, but it didn't do anything
3024620	3031020	where I was like, this is too weird for me. Like it was just, it was interesting to like,
3031020	3035660	look at things and have it like highlight that because you're looking at it with your eyes.
3035660	3041740	That was just very interesting. So, uh, yeah, that was my quick experience with the PlayStation VR
3041740	3047100	too. Uh, Y Y R says PS VR two is the new Vita. I was hoping it wouldn't be, but it's clear to me
3047100	3051660	now that Sony decided to pre-launch to basically not support it, to leave it to third parties and
3051660	3057340	then forget about it. Sadly, I worry you are probably right on that, but I would, Hey, Sony
3057340	3065500	proved me wrong. I dare you. Let's all call Sony out this week. Shut this down, support your system.
3065500	3071660	All right. Anyway. Um, and then I've been playing of course, lots of Diablo four. Cause I feel like
3071660	3075740	I'm the only person I know that still plays that game, but I'm enjoying season one. Uh, and it's
3075740	3081980	great to just do some mindless clicking, uh, in that game and enjoy that. And a little bit of final
3081980	3088300	fantasy 14, the only new game I played this week, which actually it's been out a little bit, but I
3088300	3097020	finally got around to playing tunic. And I did a stream even on, um, Wednesday, Tuesday. I don't
3097020	3102380	remember, but I played tunic. Uh, and that game is very interesting. I get the comparisons to the old
3102380	3108460	school legend of Zelda. It's very that, and very like how you find items to allow you to access
3108460	3113100	new parts of the map, like that very type of traditional setup where it sort of turns the
3113100	3119820	formula on its head that I think is very clever is the whole collecting pieces of the instruction
3119820	3125260	manual. So when you're out in the wild, you will see these sparkling cards. And when you pick it
3125260	3129740	up, you realize, Oh, this is a missing page from the instruction manual, but the instruction manual
3129740	3135740	might actually unveil something where it's like, Oh, if I knew this the whole time, this would have
3135740	3139980	been easier, or I could have gotten through this part because it was in the instruction manual.
3139980	3145420	And it tells you how to do certain things in the game visually that because the end game stuff is
3145420	3150940	all in a made up symbol language that, you know, you can't understand, but that's by design so
3150940	3155340	that the manual helps explain those things to you. So you know how to unlock it. So I thought
3155340	3160300	that was a very clever twist. And I thought the map design is really clever too, because again,
3160300	3164380	you'll go all the way through this area and find, Oh, finally, I was able to access this area and
3164380	3169260	go around and then you'll find there was a secret passage the entire time from the area you could
3169260	3174860	already access. So this game is almost certainly a speedrunner's dream. Because once you learn about
3174860	3180620	all those things, I'm sure you can be I'm sure you can bang this game out in minutes, if not a
3180620	3186220	couple hours. So yeah, I'm excited to explore that game a little more. It was it was a fun experience.
3186220	3193820	And again, it's it's a familiar formula, but really, really flipped up on its head a little
3193820	3201020	bit. So I thought that was really fun. SSJ100Matt says Mike Deft wore everyone down and for those
3201020	3206620	who don't get the joke, Deft has been saying for a long time now we need to play tunic. I mean,
3206620	3210860	it helped you know, you always want to get the vouch from your friends that a game is
3211580	3217580	particularly good. Oh, wow. Bobby says the speedrun world record is 17 minutes,
3217580	3223020	25 seconds. I'm kind of not surprised to hear that. There's got to be a secret passage system
3223020	3229900	that takes you right to the last boss or something. It's wild. But um, yeah, I genuinely
3229900	3234540	enjoy tuning. I mean, it was on my radar just from the preview trailers. But you know, there's
3234540	3239660	lots of games I'd like to play. And I always get sucked into the same old ones Diablo dead by
3239660	3244620	daylight, Final Fantasy 14, you name it. I tend to stick to the same ones, but I'm glad I branched
3244620	3253580	out and made myself play tunic and I will do it again. In this coming week or so forth. YYR says
3253580	3259340	that's faster than the original Legend of Zelda Oh, interesting. Wow. I guess it's not surprising.
3260540	3265980	All right, that was my gaming week. Let's get into some other news that has happened this week.
3265980	3270300	So we'll go around and start with Loki. Apparently there's rumors. I mean,
3270300	3275580	there's always rumors that they're going to do a PlayStation slim of some sort. But
3275580	3285660	now there's rumors and a video allegedly showing what appears to be a slimmer PlayStation five case.
3287820	3295340	Okay, we'll see if it comes out. I don't believe anything I see in the internet nowadays.
3295340	3299820	So it would be I don't know, it would be interesting if they get that out in time for the
3299820	3306460	holidays. Yeah, that's what the timing is on that, especially when, you know, something not on our
3306460	3312380	list tonight, but was definitely in the news while we were gone was this whole, you know, did Final
3312380	3319260	Fantasy 16 sell enough copies or not. And I feel like there's a lot that analysts and internet
3319260	3325580	critics are kind of reading into it a little bit. But even square has commented that, you know,
3325580	3330780	essentially being exclusive on one platform has held the sales back, which I think have a lot of
3330780	3336780	people going. This is why you should release on PC is that you're you only get congrats you played
3336780	3342620	yourself. You made that deal with Sony you made the bed lie in it. But I don't know at the same
3342620	3346940	time. I don't think it means that the game is not successful. But yeah, this is the same company
3346940	3351580	that you know, was disappointed in the sales of Tomb Raider when it sold like 3 million copies.
3352060	3356060	Oh, it failed. How much of that is actual disappointment? And how much of that are
3356060	3360380	internet people blowing things up out of proportion for clickbait headlines, especially now
3360380	3364460	that one of the most major social media websites out there literally pays you to make shit up to
3364460	3370780	get more impressions. Which is why everyone should be reducing their presence on their site. But I
3370780	3377020	digress. I'll take my soapbox and go home. Um, but here's, here's, here's the thing is that the
3377020	3381100	reason what they were blaming for all that was that there was not enough PlayStation fives out
3381100	3385660	there because we all know for years, they struggled to have enough play. It's only really
3385660	3390300	this year that you can finally walk into Target and buy a PlayStation five. It took them a long
3390300	3396460	time to get there. And so there is kind of that being pointed at as a problem for why Final Fantasy
3396460	3401020	16 and sells many copies. So it is interesting. Now we're talking about a slim because maybe this
3401020	3407260	is to try to push even more out there even at a lower price to move more exclusive games.
3407260	3409180	I gotta be honest. So looking at that, like,
3410620	3417020	I can't see that. I mean, I guess it's slimmer. It still looks really ugly. And it's not that
3417020	3424140	much. It's still pretty big. Like, no, I don't want it.
3425980	3430460	Breakman in chat says it seems a bit late in the year to announce new hardware,
3430460	3435180	even if it's just a remodel. Breakman, it does feel that way. So I acknowledge that it does
3435180	3440460	feel that way because the death of E3 has changed everything. And there's a couple other things that
3440460	3446540	play into this as well. But remember, you used to hear about these things in June. E3 is dead.
3446700	3455260	E3 is dead. She gone, girl. It's dead. It's not coming back. So well, if in the form you will,
3455260	3459260	because it already was not in the form that you remember from the past. But I don't want to have
3459260	3463980	to eat my words with catch up later on because they will take that branding and slap it on
3463980	3469820	something else. Just you wait. But the E3 you remember is dead. Okay. So that whole sense of
3469820	3476060	announcing things in June for the holiday season that died with E3. Yes, there is Summer Game Fest,
3476060	3480620	and there are still some announcements, but then other things have changed the game too.
3480620	3485580	Nintendo Switch being one of them. Don't forget how much lead time did we have on the Nintendo
3485580	3490700	Switch? We had years of rumors, but when they finally did announce the Nintendo Switch,
3490700	3498620	we had two months. Two months of warning. So they announced that in January for a March release.
3498620	3503500	So the games changed when it comes to these timetables. And as was said by somebody else
3503500	3508620	later in chat, YYR says, well, what if they announced it in September for the holiday season?
3509740	3516140	They sure could. They could do it. It's still like, I just don't see the point,
3516140	3520460	like, unless it's going to be cheaper or something, which I don't think it would be. It's just, you
3520460	3526860	know, smaller, slightly. Yeah. I mean, cool. I mean, if it means there's more consoles out there,
3527740	3532620	nice. I don't think it's a shortage right now, but yeah, I don't know.
3532620	3537260	Orange right in chat says, I was about to say the Switch didn't need an E3 reveal. Good point. Well,
3537260	3541740	don't forget Nintendo was the first one to put the knife into E3 when they took their directs
3541740	3546540	online. I mean, whether you want to be that dramatic in your phrasing or not, that was the
3546540	3551740	first piece of the wall to crumble. And you couple that with the embarrassment that Sony made out of
3551740	3558540	themselves with the unveiling of the PlayStation 3. Microsoft did it too, but they didn't do that
3558540	3563980	at E3. That was their own conference. They did it at. I like that recently that video came out
3563980	3569260	remastered in 1080p so that you can watch it in higher definition. I thought that was great.
3570620	3574220	Breakman in chat says, so what I'm hearing from Sky is that I am old. Hey,
3574220	3580860	you and me both, bro. You and me both. If I'm going to get reminded about my age by you all,
3580860	3586860	I'm dragging you all with me every week. Quest Buster with a very marginalized approach on this
3586860	3593020	that kind of finds the good balance between both saying Gamescom is also coming up. Fair point.
3593660	3597820	Sony could unveil it at Gamescom. They could. I don't know how much stock I'd put in that,
3597820	3602700	but they could. They could have that out on the show floor as their way to kind of debut it.
3602700	3608780	I don't think that it's not. Oh, your favorite. It's plausible Quest Buster. That is a plausible
3608780	3613020	answer that that could happen. I'll use your favorite word. You meaning the listeners.
3614300	3619500	All right, but we'll see. Have we heard if this is completely a diskless thing? I thought I saw
3619500	3623340	that as well. It looks like it's got a disk on it. That's the thing. That's what I don't understand.
3623980	3633100	I mean, I get it. I don't know. I was really bent out of shape about not having a disk drive
3633100	3638060	originally, but then I look at what I buy my games on now. It's all digital, so it's fine.
3638780	3645100	I think that's more OK on PC. I don't trust it as much on consoles because, you know,
3645100	3649580	you have it where it's like, oh, you can't transfer your games over to the new console
3649580	3654460	all the time, which makes sense to some degree. But it does suck, especially when you have like
3654460	3659500	a library of several hundred games or, you know, something like that. It's like, am I expected
3659500	3665820	just to keep this old console around? I guess. But, yeah, I would think if they're trying to
3665820	3673020	get it as small of a form factor as possible, as cheap of a price, you would think that they
3673020	3678940	would want to do like a slim driveless model. But nope. Allegedly, I mean, at least this
3679900	3685180	video is of a thing with a disk drive, which looks stupid. Like, I don't like how it's got
3685180	3690700	this like bulge out the side. It's pregnant with a disk drive. It's just really stupid looking.
3691580	3694220	But I mean, the original system was like that, too. It's just.
3695260	3699660	All right. I don't know. Make it boxy. It's fine. Doesn't have to be sexy, smooth
3699660	3705740	in in like curvy and stuff, because that doesn't work if I'm putting in an entertainment center,
3705740	3710060	like it needs to be boxy so I can stack things on top of it or just.
3710060	3711900	Real systems have curves, Loki.
3711900	3719180	PCs don't have curves. PCs are boxes for the most part. So come on.
3720380	3725900	Anyway. All right. Let's move on and talk about speaking of PC and consoles and other places.
3726460	3732300	One of the big game developers, Devolver Digital, had a conference this week,
3732300	3736380	but this was interesting. They called it the Devolver Delayed Showcase.
3736380	3743980	Because all they announced in this was that Angerfoot, Pepper Grinder,
3743980	3751660	the Plucky Squire, Stick It to the Stick Man and Skate Story have all moved to 2024.
3751660	3756860	So it was a three minute video called Devolver Delayed where they just made the announcements.
3756860	3760460	All of these games have shifted to 2024. Please look forward to it.
3762140	3765740	And that kind of cracked me up a little bit, to be honest. I will say that Plucky Squire is the
3765740	3770060	one that sticks out to me from that bunch. If I remember, that's the one that looks like the
3770060	3774700	storybook. It's a very interesting kind of looking little game. That's one of those games that I
3774700	3780140	won't play for two years until Mike Deft is like screaming at me every week to go play it. Go play
3780140	3785180	the Plucky Squire and then I'll do a stream of it. But that game does look interesting. And at
3785180	3792300	least I have another year before it's out because it got delayed until 2024. All right. Moving on.
3792300	3802700	Dark Sakura. Well, we've known for a while that there's been a lot of control by the Chinese
3802700	3809180	government to try to limit how people play games and what kinds of games they play and how often
3809180	3818060	they play it. And so there was actually results of their policy of implementing the curfew for
3818060	3822940	the individuals under the age of 18. It said it had no impact on heavy gaming habits.
3824620	3831980	They basically, the time limit was enacted in November 2019 with a restriction of 90 minutes
3831980	3838300	per day or three hours on public holidays. And then they were limited further August 2021,
3838300	3843900	limiting playtime to one hour on specific days, namely Fridays, weekends and holidays.
3844540	3851420	It was trying to combat gaming addiction. And other governments have been paying attention
3851420	3858700	to it, watching it as studies. So there was a team of researchers that was led by David Zendal at the
3858700	3864780	University of York. They analyzed over 7 billion hours of gameplay over an 11 week period starting
3864780	3871260	from November 2019. They focused on 118 million unique gamer profiles in China linked to Unity.
3871900	3880300	And the analysis showed that it really had no effect. In fact, they were 1.14 times more
3880300	3885900	likely to engage in heavy gaming, playing for over four hours a day, six days a week after the policy
3885900	3893740	was implemented. They noticed that, I mean, the increase isn't like that, you know, meaningful
3893740	3906620	really. But yeah. This is what happens when you try to force something on people, they're still
3906620	3912860	going to find a way to do something. And really, it begins with, you know, maybe not having a
3912860	3918780	really bad totalitarian style government, I guess. Well, I was going to read this comment from
3918780	3922620	Brakeman in our chat that says, you know what the most effective thing against children gaming too
3922620	3935340	much? Their parents. Well, even so, I would say, like, I'm going to use myself as an example.
3936220	3944620	If I'm in a situation that I'm unhappy, I'm going to look for distraction more readily. If I'm happy
3945260	3950940	and having meaningful things going on in my life, I will probably be out doing said meaningful
3950940	3955420	things. I mean, I'm not saying that gaming doesn't have any meaning or anything like that,
3955980	3961900	but I'm saying that there's clearly something else going on that makes the games a little
3961900	3966300	bit more addictive, that makes them more attractive than other things in their life.
3968060	3975100	So I would say, you know, you can't put everything 100% on a parent if you have a
3975100	3981260	willful child. I say this as a former willful child. I would agree with that. I was very good
3981260	3985660	at hiding how many video games I was playing for my parents, especially once the Game Boy came out.
3986540	3989180	Your parents cannot stop that without taking the whole thing away,
3989900	3997580	which is always going to start a fight. So at any rate, what they need to do
3998140	4005180	is go back and look at the base problem. It's like in technical troubleshooting,
4005180	4010300	you have to find the root cause. And what is the root cause of gaming addiction? Well,
4010300	4016940	it's not just the game. I mean, yeah, the game's a big part of it, but there's also something that
4016940	4025900	leads someone to do nothing but to get that dopamine release, I guess, when they're playing
4025900	4032380	a game and they hit that reward, you know, why aren't they getting that from other things?
4032380	4037580	What makes the difference here or there? And I think it's really a matter of looking at
4039020	4046540	this from a psychological point of view, a cultural point of view, a societal point of view,
4046540	4051260	rather than just say, oh, just restrict them. That'll do it. No, it won't. An addict will find
4051260	4055180	a way to feed their addiction. All right.
4056940	4060940	Well, let's move on to another story. It looks like someone hit pause on your avatar. I don't
4060940	4070860	know if the program just. But anyway, Loki, OK. You know, it's funny to see Roblox out
4070860	4080540	metaverse in the metaverse, but, you know, we have a story about Roblox allowing folks to actually
4081260	4089980	apply and kind of interview for jobs in Roblox. So Roblox Corporation themselves are actually
4089980	4098380	having areas in their own platform where you can actually get an idea of what it would be like to
4098380	4104300	have a career at Roblox. They have an innovation center where candidates can come in and see what
4104300	4109020	they have planned. They have a podcast lounge we could listen to. Apparently they have a podcast. I
4109020	4117500	mean, everybody has a podcast, I guess, by their CEO. And they have a library with curated selection
4117500	4123420	of books and other reading materials. People who are really going to read books in Roblox,
4123420	4130220	I just don't see that happening. But yeah, they said the Roblox, the Career Center will let the
4130220	4136220	company reach early career candidates across the world. How early are we talking here, children?
4137100	4142860	Um, wait, I don't know. Can we play orange on radio in Roblox? Why aren't we jumping if we if
4142860	4149580	you could do podcasts in Roblox? Where's the OLR? You probably could I think maybe we can make home
4150780	4157500	my son's at the same time. Kids shouldn't listen to this show. So if Roblox is mostly kids, then
4157500	4163820	maybe it's well, that's where that's where the mature rated content in Roblox, which is a recent
4163820	4171740	edition comes into play. So technically, it is Roblox material at this point. Gotcha. But yeah,
4171740	4176060	my son's actually doing Roblox programming now, because he's gotten to that level in his
4176060	4183740	programming class to where he is doing Lua. So it's strictly for Roblox stuff. But yeah,
4185100	4188780	there's a place you should put PlayStation home in Roblox. There you go.
4189020	4192940	All right, I have to giggle a little bit, too, because I think I think dark soccer stepped away
4192940	4200060	for a minute. But her avatar looks like like it frozen is really funny. But I guess when it
4200060	4204220	stopped, like camera tracking, as she was getting up and leaving, it just looks like it looks like
4204220	4210460	she's tilted her head back and passed out in her chair. Like Loki's Loki's Roblox story was so
4210460	4217420	fucking boring. It put the vtubers to sleep. I mean, it isn't exactly super interesting.
4219100	4231260	I don't know why the image is so funny to me. All right. Anyhow, let's talk about other things that
4231260	4239260	have been around a while. Let's talk about Pokemon presents. So Pokemon had a very special recap or
4239260	4244060	direct whatever you want to call it this week. It was the Pokemon presents August 2023 showcase
4244060	4251100	where they had 35 minutes of updates on different projects, including DLC for Scarlet and Violet,
4251100	4258620	the hidden treasure of areas, area zero, area zero. Also, there was an update on the Pokemon
4258620	4264460	World Championships, which I think was going on this weekend in Yokohama, which means competitions
4264460	4270940	for Scarlet Violet, the trading card game Unite Go even has a competition there because Pokemon Go
4270940	4274620	has a whole tie-in thing going on right now in that game. So they were talking a little bit
4274620	4281260	about that. They were talking about an animated mini web series called Pokemon Path to the Peak.
4281260	4286940	This is about the trading card game. And in this little cartoon, we got to meet the protagonist and
4286940	4293100	you know, the oddish partner Pokemon. It will be on YouTube now. Actually, it came out on the 11th
4293100	4298940	of August. So it's available now. Then we got into some of the good stuff for gaming. A new trailer
4298940	4304700	for Detective Pikachu Returns. Sorry, Danny DeVito is still not the voice of Detective
4304700	4309580	Pikachu, but the game does look fun for those that are curious about that. There was also a teaser
4309580	4319580	for Pokemon Horizons, the series. This is the show post Ash Ketchum and all that. The kickoff date
4319580	4325820	will be September 8th in North America is when that series will be launching for us here. They
4325820	4332380	did some updates for Pokemon Go. They were begging people to buy tickets for Pokemon Go Fest Global
4332380	4337260	on the 26th and 27th of August, even if you're not going to the New York City one in person.
4337980	4343180	They also are saying that DNC, I don't know how to say this Pokemon's name, sorry,
4343180	4349100	is making the Pokemon Go debut and it will have a mega evolution as well. And Mega Rayquaza is also
4349100	4356620	coming to the game. Whoopee! But the big announcement for Pokemon Go, the new Pokemon from
4356620	4363340	Gen 9, starter Pokemon, will be making their Go debut in September. What's kind of interesting
4363340	4372300	about this news is that Gen 8's not finished. It's far from finished. The starters for Gen 8
4372300	4376300	are not in the game. They're going to put the starters for Gen 9 in the game before they do
4376300	4380780	the starters for Gen 8, which I think is interesting. I don't know. Just to be different.
4380780	4385740	They have some, like Wooloo is in the game of some other Gen 8 Pokemon, but they, for whatever
4385740	4390540	reason, are skipping it otherwise. I don't know if this is just Go being different. It probably,
4390540	4396700	honestly, it's probably just to tie into the fact that there is Scarlet and Violet DLC coming out.
4396700	4401980	And so they want to do a tie into that and push those games back to the front with the holiday
4401980	4407100	season around the corner. There's a lot of people that, you know, Pokemon Go is their primary
4407100	4415020	Pokemon game. So I think it has to do more with all that than everything else. Pokemon Unite is
4415020	4421340	getting a new game mode called Panic Parade. With this mode, you work with your teammates to protect
4421340	4427820	a certain Pokemon from oncoming enemies. Also, Mewtwo License X is now in the game and Mewtwo
4427820	4434380	License X can evolve into Mega Mewtwo X. And then guess what's coming on 17th of August? Mewtwo
4434380	4442780	License Y, of course. And then in Pokemon Master Sex, which actually the game is called Pokemon
4442780	4449420	Masters EX, but it's impossible to read this and not see Pokemon Master Sex. I mean it. That's
4450220	4454300	just the order of the letters. Yeah. Pokemon Master Sex will be seeing
4455260	4460380	Nimona from Scarlet and Violet and Pomat are coming to the game. It is a new sync pair in
4460380	4467820	the game with the sprint roll that allows them to attack quickly. A Pokemon Cafe remix game is
4467820	4474380	coming up. And I think probably the news that had a lot of people excited was Pokemon Trading Card
4474380	4481020	Game and Pokemon Stadium 2 were released on Nintendo Switch Online. Why they won't just put
4481020	4487660	out the classic Pokemon games is anyone's guess. My guess is they want to sell it separately someday.
4487660	4492460	But still, the Pokemon Trading Card Game was pretty good as was Stadium 2. A lot of people
4492460	4496300	do like those games. So you can check those out with the NSO. Of course, you'll need the
4496300	4504300	expansion pack for Pokemon Stadium 2, but that is something that will be coming soon. And then last,
4504300	4509020	we'll mention the Mewtwo Terra Raid battle in Scarlet and Violet. That is going to be happening
4509020	4515100	from September 1st through September 17th. And then they showed a little bit of a deep dive on
4515100	4522140	the DLC that's also coming out with the hidden treasures of area zero, which feature the teal
4522140	4529900	mask and the indigo disc. That's part one and part two. It's one DLC in two parts. So there you go.
4530540	4536140	Lots of Pokemon news, although most people saying the presents overall was kind of lackluster.
4537020	4541900	My guess is it's because the focus was a little less on the games and there was a lot of stuff
4541900	4546620	on the anime. I think a lot of Pokemon fans don't care for GO, quite frankly.
4551340	4556060	There's a lot of stuff that doesn't really relate to the games. I think people set the bar too high
4556060	4559820	in expecting that they were going to announce a remake or something. It's not time for that yet.
4559820	4564860	You got to wait for next year for news on whatever they're going to do. If they're remaking Gen 5 or
4564860	4569020	whatever they're doing, there's a lot of rumors going around with that. One rumor was that instead
4569020	4575020	of doing a remake of Gen 5, they're going to do like a basically a sequel, which is funny because
4575020	4579260	there already is a black to white too. So I don't know, but this is something I guess they're
4579260	4583580	looking at maybe black three. I don't know something that may be like a spiritual successor
4583580	4589340	or something. Who knows? So Mike Defton chat says for me, it was fine. I really didn't expect
4589340	4595660	anything really mind blowing. Tigerclaw in chat says, good thing they separated the EX from
4595660	4602060	Pokemon masters EX. That little space bar is not going to stop the internet from saying Pokemon
4602060	4608220	master sex. Once it's there, it's there. It's once on the internet, always on the internet.
4609260	4613260	All right. Speaking of things that are now always on the internet, Dark Sakura.
4614700	4619100	Hey, I'm not always on the internet. Not always, but even when you step
4619100	4621660	away from your keyboard, your avatar is still here on the internet.
4622780	4625580	Apparently she does very wonky things when I'm not here.
4626460	4632220	Yeah. I know about that. I know about that. It's just, uh, the cousins came over and there's a
4632220	4636700	spaghetti with the spasm meatball. Oh no, you don't, you don't have to explain it. It's just
4636700	4640060	funny that when you stepped away, your Pokemon was like, or your Pokemon.
4641020	4655180	I know Jamie Mon go, use pester ball. It's super effective.com. Anyway. So, um, there is a comic
4655180	4659500	series that I was actually super excited about when it came out and that was, uh, Teenage Mutant
4659500	4668220	Ninja Turtles, The Last Ronin. And it was pretty, uh, pretty heartbreaking. The concept behind it,
4668220	4675100	where you're one of the turtles and the other three are dead. And so you're carrying their,
4675100	4681100	their, your, their weapons with you. And you're trying to seek some vengeance, um, to get, you
4681100	4688140	know, justice for their murder. Um, and it's really dark. It's really dark, but it still has some of
4688140	4695820	the, some of the same heart, you know, packaged in it. But at any rate, there is a teaser put up
4696060	4702540	and, uh, that's for, uh, uh, a game, uh, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Last Ronin, the game.
4702540	4707580	Um, the, the trailer is just some pretty kind of generic stuff. Um,
4709980	4716540	Strong Bad Game. Sorry. I got distracted. Thanks. It's Loki. No, you're not. It's okay.
4716540	4726540	It's dangerous. So that's fine. Um, but anyway, uh, there's no real details on it. There's not a
4726540	4733660	release date, not a window for it, but the trailer is really pretty. And if they do it right, this is
4733660	4741980	going to be a really good dark story. It has a very unique art style that is very much not the
4741980	4746460	nineties iteration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that most of us associate with Ninja Turtles.
4746460	4753180	Let's be real. It's, it's honestly, uh, quite a bit, uh, like the comic, it looks a lot like
4753180	4763740	how the comic looked. Um, and I mean, the comics are, are they've been like the very original ones
4763740	4771980	were quite dark. They were quite dark and, uh, and, you know, really, really just the stories
4771980	4779260	were definitely geared a little bit more adult, you know, so at any rate, at any rate, it's,
4779260	4786700	it's, um, I'm hoping that the, that the game, uh, matches the, the comics in quality.
4789580	4792860	Well, some folks in our chat room are already pretty impressed with where it's headed. Quest
4792860	4798220	Buster saying the last Ronan is so good. I hope the game turns out well, uh, tiger claw pointing
4798220	4802220	out, they're continuing the comics. They released new comics. That's a prequel and a sequel,
4802220	4808780	and it introduces a new generation of Ninja Turtles. Yeah. Now I don't know. The one thing
4808780	4817660	that, um, I was keeping up with the IDW, um, series, you know, just the, the ongoing one.
4818620	4826780	And it was just going from how those have been to this. I definitely am seeing it as sort of like
4826780	4833500	an alternate future sort of thing from that continuity, but still it's, it's, it's really
4833500	4838140	good and pretty dark. So, and I'm not going to spoil who the surviving turtle is for those who
4838140	4844940	don't know. Okay. All right. Well, let's move on and let's see if, uh, this, the market can survive
4845020	4850140	the rerelease of this game Loki, cause this is an interesting story. Not even a rerelease. It's
4850140	4855740	a port, which is even worse. Uh, I mean, I guess it's technically you're releasing again, but on
4855740	4863260	another system. So, um, this stinks of the grand theft auto San Andreas definitive edition, but
4863260	4869420	it's not, it's basically a port of the original red dead redemption, which is coming out now for
4869420	4878060	the switch and the PlayStation five. Um, why not Xbox? Because there's already a version that is
4878060	4884620	playable on Xbox and for less money. Uh, this version is going to be $50. What have they done
4884620	4889900	to the game? Not really much. They haven't really remastered anything on it. Actually,
4889900	4895980	it's just a straight port plus the undead nightmare DLC, which was like the game of
4895980	4899420	the year edition that they sold for 20 bucks, but now they're selling for 50.
4900060	4905340	Please don't support this. It's awful. Especially since they didn't port at the PC either. So
4906780	4914300	whatever. I mean, I don't know. I just would not support this stuff. Of course, CEO Strauss
4914300	4920300	Zelnick thinks it's a great price. It's we, we, we believe it's a commercially accurate price for it.
4921100	4925580	How about we wait for a deep sale instead, because you know what? There's no rush to play
4925740	4931580	red dead redemption on any modern console now, because it's been out for a long time.
4932780	4936620	I'm sure there will still be people that buy this and whatever it's fine, but they shouldn't
4936620	4941980	support it at $50 because it's all that, that sends a signal to rockstar games that they can
4941980	4946300	just do whatever they want, put it out and people will just eat it up for whatever price they put
4946300	4953900	it out there. And like, especially like we got burnt by the, um, definitive edition, like
4953900	4959100	absolutely do not pre-order this and wait for the reviews to come out before you play it. Cause
4960140	4965100	yeah, the switch isn't a powerful piece of hardware and we're talking about running
4965100	4972620	red dead redemption on it. I would wait for the reviews. PlayStation five, probably fine.
4974380	4979580	Here's something else with the price and all that stuff. I feel like the industry, like not just,
4979580	4985900	you know, take two and whoever, like the entire industry needs to remember why did the Wii U fail?
4985900	4991020	There's a lot of reasons why the Wii U failed, but here's one big reason that we, you failed
4991020	4994140	is because when you look at the launch software that came out for the Wii U,
4994140	4998460	the vast majority of it was stuff. And even the things that they were highlighting at E3,
4998460	5003100	when they announced the Wii U, yes, there were some original things on it. And, you know,
5003100	5007660	none of it was of the same quality of the launch titles of other systems before it. But I digress.
5007660	5012060	The real issue was there were a lot of these third party games that were coming out,
5012060	5017180	things like mass effect three, uh, the Batman Arkham games, you know, and all this stuff.
5017180	5021900	There were these games that were coming out that had already been out for a year,
5022620	5027340	had already been discounted as a result. And now they were trying to put these games out on the
5027340	5033020	Wii U at the full retail price. And then they were wondering why do people not buy these games?
5033740	5039340	And I'm reminded too, that this version of red dead redemption doesn't have multiplayer,
5040300	5046220	which was fun. I used to play the multiplayer of red dead redemption with my coworkers and it was
5046220	5051820	a, it was a great time. Not part of it. You're, you're getting even less content for more money.
5054140	5058140	Zen monkey 11 quite bluntly says, fuck that shit. I won't even buy it on sale.
5058860	5064380	I, I get it. Uh, as John Hunter, Matt says that same CEO got his salary doubled recently. I'd
5064380	5069260	like to see how he justifies that. Excellent question. Uh, making billions of dollars on
5069260	5075580	the stupid app, you know, shark cards is how he does it, which isn't his doing like he just sits
5075580	5080620	there and collects money. Uh, while we are in chat says PC port probably coming later because that's
5080620	5089020	what rock star does. Hmm. Well on the PC front and eventually the console front as well. Uh,
5089020	5094220	we have, uh, this, this game has been everywhere. This is another one of those games. I know we
5094220	5098780	talked about Palia earlier, but this game is also just taken over Twitch. I have a ton of friends
5098780	5103580	that have been streaming this game and it's Baldur's gate three. And I got to say this game,
5103580	5107260	like I never really got into the older Baldur's gate games, which I know were hugely popular at
5107260	5112540	the time. Um, but the, just watching people play this, it kind of has my attention and I'm like,
5112540	5118060	Oh, should I be picking this up? I don't know, but the game is not without its own issues.
5118060	5126300	Uh, apparently, uh, some translation folks that worked on the game, uh, namely outsourced workers
5126300	5133100	were omitted from the games credits, uh, founder and CEO of the Altagram group,
5133100	5137900	which was the studio that handled these translations said we take full responsibility
5137900	5142620	for this omission of our freelancers names and apologize for the effects that it had.
5142620	5147980	We would like to thank Larian, the makers of, um, Baldur's gate three for allowing us to quickly
5147980	5153180	fix that error and update the credit section. The names of the Brazilian Portuguese translators will
5153180	5158700	be included in an upcoming patch to the game. Let's let, let us take a moment to remember
5158700	5164460	Brazil is a very large country, and that's a lot of potential sales. And to do that,
5164460	5169260	you need a hardworking translators, you know, localizers as well to work on your game to do
5169260	5174380	that. So even though for you, me, most people that listen to this show, because we don't speak
5174380	5179100	Portuguese, it doesn't seem like a big deal to leave these folks out. It's a huge deal to leave
5179100	5184860	these folks out when an entire country, you know, relies on them essentially and others to not just,
5184860	5190380	but that's been the largest one to be able to play this game and make it more accessible. So
5191180	5196300	that's really unfortunate. I don't know how the fuck that got overlooked. I have a feeling if we
5196300	5201180	worked in a unionized industry, it would have been a lot harder to overlook, but I, I'm getting on a
5201180	5208540	different tangent perhaps. Anyway, um, Larian studios did say Altagram was to blame for the
5208540	5212700	oversight and they asked the company to rectify the situation. And of course, of course they
5212700	5217820	obliged. They kind of have to do that. Um, but it's worth pointing out. Outsourced workers don't
5217820	5223340	always get fully credited for their work. This can sometimes impact future projects. It can be
5223340	5229500	difficult to prove that you worked on a potential game to a new employer. Um, you know, I know a lot
5229500	5233900	of people just skip the credits and don't look at them. I get it. The games that are coming out these
5233900	5239740	days have very long credit sequences and people tend to skip them, but that's important to the
5239740	5244060	people that worked on the game because even to have that moment of look, it's my name and the
5244060	5248060	game, and then to be able to put that on something like your LinkedIn profile or whatever, that's
5248060	5255100	huge and that's important. So let's just hope that this gets fixed for the future. But of course,
5255100	5260380	there's another cloud hanging over all of this. They'll probably be developers that are going to
5260380	5266220	try to get artificial intelligence, which is really machine learning, but automated, we'll say
5266220	5271580	automated translation services to do that. All I'm going to say with that, you all have used
5271580	5277340	Google translate. I don't think machine learning is going to be that much better at it. You get
5277340	5283740	what you pay for. Period. End of sentence. Do not leave these entire countries out because
5283740	5290380	you think chat GPT can do the job of a human being when it comes to language, which is how we
5290380	5300060	express ourselves and share culture. It's so infuriating. Anyway, maybe I have the WGA strike
5300060	5307020	fresh in my mind and some of the things they're fighting for. Who knows? Anyway, we need to take
5307020	5312140	a moment to go back to a simpler time. So I think it's time to call in the next segment to save us
5312140	5328540	here. Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out
5328540	5335740	a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. But once a month,
5335820	5342220	Dark Sakura flips the script with a non-video game. So Dark Sakura, what did you pack for us
5342220	5351660	tonight? The game is Don't Break the Ice. It is a tabletop game for two to four players,
5351660	5360620	three ages and up. And it was first marketed by Shapper Toys in 1968, sold to Hasbro as a
5360620	5366060	subsidy of Milton Bradley in 1986. And it's still in production with very special versions,
5366060	5373420	including Frozen and Frozen 2. So basically you have these ice blocks and a stand
5373980	5379660	and a miniature plastic hammer for each player. And one block is bigger than the rest. And there
5379660	5386380	is a plastic character sitting on it. And some additions, it's Phillip the penguin and a dude
5386460	5393100	called Iceman or a polar bear. To set it up, basically you turn the stand upside down and
5393100	5398860	you put all the blocks in so that the, I mean, basically it's using compression to hold all of
5398860	5405020	the blocks in place, you know. And then you take turns removing blocks by tapping with the hammer.
5405660	5410140	And when one player causes the block with a character to fall through,
5410380	5419180	then the person before that is the winner. So, but I mean, very simple premise for a game,
5419180	5425740	you know, it, I would imagine that, you know, it's various versions are really just limited
5425740	5430300	to anything kind of snow theme, you know. But I mean,
5431260	5439740	many different covers it's had, so many different, you know, ways that their little
5439740	5448940	thing has looked, the brace for it. And you can still, you know, go to, like, I think it's like
5448940	5457980	17 bucks through Hasbro, but you can get it practically at any store. And from the Hasbro
5457980	5466140	edition box, I'll go ahead and read the little poem it comes with. Tap out ice blocks one by one,
5466140	5471820	they won't melt when you are done. Take your time and do some thinking to keep the polar bear from
5471820	5476220	sinking. To win the bear must stay on top. One wrong block, he'll go kerplop.
5478860	5484940	And a notable thing is that in 2004, this one, the Japan board game prize for best
5484940	5491260	child game. Actually, I take that back, it was just nominee. But, but that's the game.
5491260	5502220	Don't break the ice. And I mean, like, even the original box. It was very 60s. But like this,
5502220	5506780	this game is just fun. You know, it's good fun. And I like putting things other than the little
5506780	5510940	dude on top. You know, like putting a Sonic figure up there.
5511900	5513820	You know, like putting a Sonic figure up there.
5514780	5518060	Oh, amiibo would be good for the answer. Those might be a little heavy.
5518060	5522620	Amiibos will be too heavy. Maybe like a little gotcha pun figure.
5522620	5525420	Yeah, something you get out of a vending machine for a quarter.
5526780	5530860	bonds 006 and chat says my attention span would not want to play this the setup and
5530860	5535340	downtime is too much. Well, this guy in the YouTube really that long. I know this guy in
5535340	5540380	the YouTube videos moving at a glacial pace pun intended. I don't remember the game taking this
5540380	5545180	long to set up to be quite honest. So I'm sure he's explaining things that we have muted while
5545180	5548940	he's doing this. But yeah, usually you just you get everybody to collect the pieces and you can
5548940	5552540	set it up pretty quick. Like it's just Yeah, you know, that big block. I mean,
5553580	5559900	if a bunch of junk queer people can do it. Yeah, and it's not an ASMR video. It's just a review
5559900	5567900	of the game. But I mean, we did it. We made it work. Phil of nine is in chat. Who is there that
5567900	5574940	night that infamous night grandpa's so yeah, it was good time. That was also the night that
5576140	5578860	that I think we decided to buy grandpa's house.
5581100	5584380	Except somebody else bought it because he didn't live there.
5585740	5590620	No, no, this house. Oh, oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was thinking of the house we were at
5590620	5597340	that night. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I always Yeah, I always I honestly Jamie, I forget that grandpa
5597340	5601500	lived there. Which is funny because I don't remember sitting on the back porch. I know
5601500	5606460	what I named furniture. Now that you say it. I do. But sometimes in my brain, I don't associate
5606460	5612460	it with being the same house. You know what I mean? Yeah, even though Yes, it is. So it's just
5612460	5620300	funny. Well, if this is my house, you feel like it. You get the fuck out. Anyway, I it's being
5620300	5624300	mentioned our chat by Jim Sally since we were talking about you know, if drunk queer people
5624300	5630460	can do it. Jim Sally and chat says we high straight people can do it too. Yeah, well,
5630460	5636940	I'm glad. Where's the where's that meme? Where it's like, you know, the hands shaking where
5636940	5642700	that might be the quote unquote opposing views, drunk queer people, high straight people playing
5642700	5647500	don't break the ice. There you go. You have the little little world peace agreement there. All
5647500	5653260	right. All right. If the high straight people and the junk gay people teamed up,
5653740	5662380	the world would be in trouble. Or, or something. All right. Let's move on and talk about some
5662380	5666860	other headlines at a rapid pace and what we call rapid fire news. Loki.
5667980	5676540	Yes, the lollipop chainsaw remake is been delayed. Wasn't quite part of the developer digital delay
5676540	5682700	announcement, but it's its own delay announcement, I guess, coming out next summer now. And then
5682700	5691980	Netflix just released a app to turn your phone or tablet into a controller for playing their games,
5691980	5697500	I assume on TV. That sounds horrible. I'd rather have a controller to do that. But
5698540	5706300	at least it's an option. I mean, that works for like jackbox. But it's a very particular
5706300	5712380	type of game that a phone controller will work for. Yeah, but when they're talking about like
5712380	5723100	Assassin's Creed, no, I would rather not. Same. Same. All right, moving on dark soccer.
5724380	5730380	So Sega has some announcements for Samba de Amigo Party Central. They put out their roadmap for the
5730380	5736780	DLC. On August 29th, we will have the Sonic the Hedgehog music pack for five bucks,
5737420	5742460	as Open Your Heart, Reach for the Stars, and I'm Here. And then the Japanese music pack,
5742460	5749260	which is Kaikai Kitan, Matsuken Samba 2, and King, which is a Hatsune Miku one.
5749900	5757420	On September 27th, we have Sega Music Pack, Bakamitai Taxi Driver Edition. We have Go Go
5757500	5763180	Cheer Girl from Space Channel 5 Part 2, Rhythm Thief Theme from Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's
5763180	5770300	Treasure, and then a K-Pop pack with details to be announced. So you can still get the Digital
5770300	5775740	Deluxe Edition that has the standard version of the game, the Sonic the Hedgehog music pack,
5775740	5782300	the Sega music pack from September 27th, a Sonic the Hedgehog costume and accessories pack,
5782300	5786540	a Tails costume and accessories pack, Super Monkey Ball costume and accessories pack,
5786540	5791820	P.O.P.O. accessories pack, which is what I want, and the Space Channel 5 costume and accessories
5791820	5797900	pack. And then there's also the digital upgrade bundle, where you basically just pay extra for
5797900	5805100	the bonus stuff. It will be out on the Switch on August 29th. Oh wow, that's really soon. I
5805100	5811500	didn't realize Samba's like around the corner. That's pretty cool. All right. Well, music game
5811500	5816460	fans, don't say I don't still love you because I have a new music game to talk about here,
5816460	5824460	which is, I'm going to butcher the name of this, but it's Toho Danmaku Kagura Fantasia Lost.
5824460	5828300	Toho. Toho. So this is basically
5830140	5837500	a rhythm game around the Toho project, and it is coming out for PC on Steam on February 8th.
5837580	5845340	So also, and of note to other gaming fans, there will be a collaboration song with Toby Fox from
5845340	5849340	Undertale, who, you know, of course, created and did the music to that game. He's basically
5849340	5851980	the John Carpenter of video games. How many more versions of
5851980	5854140	Megalovania can we get? All of them.
5854140	5858460	It sounds like this is actually a new song because he's collaborating with
5858460	5863980	Zune from Toho Project to actually do this as free DLC. So that's kind of cool.
5863980	5868380	There are two different rhythm games within this, the Kagura stage, where you hit the notes
5868380	5874220	at the right moment and you stack up combos and get the high score. And then a Danmaku stage,
5874220	5877820	which is what we're seeing on Twitch right now, if you're watching, which is a shoot them up
5877820	5883580	mixed with a rhythm game. That's kind of neat. I like that. That might be worth checking out
5883580	5889100	there. You hit the notes on the sides rhythmically to do damage to the boss, and then you do missions
5889100	5893500	and do all that good stuff there. So, oh, that's kind of neat.
5893500	5897660	It's like a neat little spin on that. And, uh, you know, from a, from a franchise that a lot
5897660	5902460	of people know about. So yeah, it looks very pop and music a little bit, a little bit. So remember,
5902460	5906460	it's going to be, I believe it's on the switch as well at some point, but right now it's going
5906460	5910860	to be on steam. I thought I saw something about a switch release at some point. I mean,
5910860	5915900	I'll probably get it. Yeah. Uh, I do kind of wonder if I would be able to hook up my
5915900	5921500	pop-in controller. Oh, maybe that would be fun. Uh, Chad Leland's in chat. Hey,
5921500	5927980	Shane say he's also a Pokemon composer now to me, his stuff in Scarlet violet is real good. Yeah.
5927980	5932860	I mean, they, and it's not just making love. He does new pieces for stuff. He's a very good
5932860	5937580	composer. Again. It's it's like, he's the John Carpenter of games. Like he directs the movies
5937580	5943420	and, you know, obviously that iconic Halloween soundtrack with a piano that John Carpenter wrote
5943420	5949820	that. So that's, yeah. I've, I've, I don't know if you've heard me say it, Rob, but when I'm in
5949820	5956380	chase against a, uh, uh, um, a Meyers, I almost called him Kyle. We call him Kyle. Why do you
5956380	5962700	call him Kyle? That's Shayla. Shayla is the one who started it. So now like when we're mad at him
5962700	5970780	is like Michael Kyle, Albert Alfonso Meyers, you know, the second. Oh, his legal name. I see. Yeah.
5970780	5977580	But, um, but when, uh, whenever the chase music is like go away, John Carpenter, because I took
5977580	5984060	it from that. There's a parody out there that, you know, John Carpenter's following Michael
5984060	5993660	around with, with his little keyboard. Yeah. Perfect. All right. Uh, with that,
5993660	5997580	let's travel around the world and check out what video games are coming out this week.
5997580	6002860	We'll start in the U S with Loki. All right. Yeah. We have quite a few things coming out
6002860	6009580	this week, actually. So starting off with Everspace 2 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox series,
6010140	6016940	HammerWatch 2 on PC, Moving Out 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
6016940	6025740	Xbox One and Xbox series, Unguard on PC, the Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood on PC and Nintendo Switch,
6026460	6035340	uh, Afogato on PC, uh, Kentucky Route Zero on the TV edition. I don't know what that is exactly.
6035340	6044140	That's on a PlayStation 5 and Xbox series, Marble It Up Ultra, which, um, is, you may remember this
6044140	6050780	as Marble Blast Ultra. They changed the name. Uh, that is now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
6050780	6056220	PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series. That's like one of the first, uh, Xbox live arcade games
6056220	6063900	that I had. Um, reminder, don't buy this game, uh, Red Dead Redemption coming out on Nintendo
6063900	6068700	Switch and PlayStation 4 this, uh, oh, I thought it was PlayStation 5. Oh, okay. Well, that's even
6068700	6076140	worse. Uh, well, PlayStation 4, um, Shadow Gambit, The Cursed Crew on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox
6076140	6084620	series, uh, Shinobi Non Grata on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. And, uh, this is a better use
6084620	6089340	of your money right here on the Nintendo Switch, Vampire Survivors coming out on Nintendo Switch.
6089900	6097020	And then, uh, last but not least, we have a few more for Friday, uh, Bomb Rush Cyber Funk on PC
6097020	6103100	and Nintendo Switch. Also another title well worth your money versus Red Dead Redemption,
6103660	6111180	um, Madden NFL 24 on PC, PlayStation 5, uh, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox series,
6111180	6115820	Radiant Silver Gun. I swear to God, it's like coming out every single week. That's on PC.
6115820	6121740	This is like Ikaruga again. Uh, that's true. And last but not least, um,
6121740	6128380	Texas Chainsaw Massacre on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series.
6129340	6133180	All right. Well, that's it. That may not be a Halloween video game, but that is a different
6133180	6137980	Dead by Daylight Killer getting its own game. Uh, and that, that one looked interesting in
6137980	6142620	the previous. I don't know if it looked more interesting than DVD to me. It just,
6143180	6148220	I don't know. I, it looked, it looked like it was a lot more faithful to the, um, movie than I would
6148220	6154940	have thought. I was very surprised that like, wow, they actually did kind of create a, um,
6155580	6159020	what do they call it? Asymmetrical multiplayer game out of the movie. That was pretty surprising.
6160380	6167100	So, uh, all right. Let's let you know, there was that big, big, there was that big thing though
6167100	6173180	that got leakers in trouble for saying that they were, they had data mined and that, you know,
6173180	6177900	uh, Bubba was going to be gone from the game and they use that to catch people.
6177900	6183020	Yeah. And, uh, it turns out you can, you can be in Dead by Daylight and still have your own video
6183020	6188860	game. So if, uh, the folks from stranger things and Netflix are listening, uh, both those things
6188860	6194380	are possible as it turns out. So, uh, at this point I would travel to Japan and tell you what's
6194380	6199180	coming out this week in Japan, but guess what? Nothing is coming out this week in Japan. I don't
6199180	6205260	know what, and it's not golden week, so it's not that, but for whatever reason, there's, there's a
6205260	6209900	third party converter. Like if you want to use different controllers on your PlayStation five,
6209900	6214140	like there's a con that that's, that's not really a game, but that's like the only thing that's
6214140	6221260	coming out, uh, in Japan for whatever reason. So go figure. Um, the break manager says, sorry,
6221260	6227340	mountain day. Uh, the break manager says, I liked, I liked the Friday, the 13th game. I like the
6227340	6232300	original NES one, but I know you're bringing up the asymmetrical multiplayer one that got
6232300	6236940	fucked by licensing, but I would, I would argue without that game, we probably wouldn't have the
6237020	6242060	success of something like day dead by daylight. It's a bummer that licensing issues and greed
6242060	6246300	essentially really fucked that Friday, the 13th game, because that was fun. It was different. It
6246300	6251500	was different experience. Um, I just hope with the closure of that, maybe they'll finally license
6251500	6255260	Jason for the big game. We want to see him in, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.
6255980	6261260	So, uh, let's go to Europe until then, until then we can just play trapper.
6262460	6266780	Yes, you do have that. And the fact that the Friday, the 13th game, I believe is still running
6266780	6271740	through the end of the year. Um, uh, yeah, I can't remember the exact day they were closing it,
6271740	6278220	but I think you still have a little bit longer. Well, at any rate, um, for what's coming out in,
6278220	6288060	uh, the UK and, and Europe on August 15th for switch Xbox PlayStation is moving out to, um,
6288060	6295180	on the 17th for PlayStation and Xbox is gored on the 18th for those same two is the Texas
6295180	6306780	chainsaw massacre. Um, also Madden NFL 24 and also, um, uh, curse of the stars and that's it.
6310460	6314940	All right. Sorry. I was typing something in chat and I want my keyboard going through,
6314940	6320780	uh, let's touch on a couple other headlines and then we'll get to the mailbag as well as
6320780	6324540	potentially maybe any calls tonight. We're going to get later on if you want to participate that
6324540	6329580	way with our show, head on over to the green room over at vog network.com that's VOG network.com
6329580	6335020	slash discord to join our discord server. Uh, and we do chat throughout the week in discord as well.
6335020	6341260	And if you're a subscriber here on Twitch, uh, you actually get access to a special channel as
6341260	6346620	well for, and sometimes we post little sneak peaks, such as the videos that we shot on Thursday,
6346620	6350220	our subscribers had a heads up there and the subscriber chat. So check that out. You do have
6350220	6353740	to have your Twitch link to discord. If you're sitting here going, I don't see that. And I'm
6353740	6357260	subbed to the channel. Make sure your Twitch is linked to discord because otherwise it doesn't
6357260	6361020	know how to set the settings that way. All right. Uh, some other headlines, Loki.
6362140	6369420	Uh, so we just recently had a quake con. And with that, we got the announcement
6370220	6378780	of a quake to remaster. So it is the original game, but better and now out on Xbox series,
6378780	6385740	X and S and PC, and which is kind of surprising eight player split screen.
6385740	6387180	That's pretty rad.
6387900	6393820	It's pretty awesome. And, um, you know, being that it's a very probably light game to run on
6393820	6399980	those consoles, uh, that's probably how you can get away with that. But, um, he said right now
6399980	6408780	it is, um, also going to be, or apparently quick three arena is also being, um, or has been
6408780	6416300	remastered as well, or is coming in, I guess for other, that's the best one. Yeah. So, um,
6417580	6423740	very cool. Yeah. I, I haven't played quake two and I remember quake two, not nearly as well received
6423740	6428700	as one and three. Um, and, uh, but I, I'll check it. I mean, especially, I believe it's on game
6428700	6433180	pass. So what's to stop me from checking it out. Uh, the multiplayer is always a lot of fun in
6433180	6437020	those games. So, um, yeah, I might have to grab that on game pass and check it out. It sounds
6437020	6445660	like a lot of fun. So cool. All right. Hmm. So neat, neat. All right. Moving on dark Sakura.
6447740	6453820	Um, there is a new mobile game coming out in the final fantasy seven universe. That's, uh,
6453820	6461260	going to add some backstory and be, uh, another little bit in the, in the whole series. Like
6461260	6467020	basically it's called final fantasy seven ever crisis that expands the story and the universe.
6467020	6475660	Um, but also retells, um, uh, more of what went on in final fantasy seven. Um, it's, uh, developed
6475660	6485100	by Apple bot, um, and, uh, other people involved in it for, uh, for, uh, as a scenario writer,
6485100	6491180	executive producer and creative director is, uh, Nogima Kazushige, Kitasi Yoshinori,
6491180	6498700	and Nomura Tetsuya respectively. And it's, uh, hearkening back to the chibi days of,
6498700	6502140	of final fantasy seven in the early ones, but cloud has hands.
6503100	6509100	Um, but it also does, but it also does include some stuff from the first soldier's backstory,
6509100	6516460	which is another mobile game, and it will be free to play, but there are gotcha aspects,
6516460	6523020	you know, like a gotcha bond to get weapons that you would put money into. Oh, there you go.
6523020	6529020	Um, I never realized this YYR in chat says, um, there's a bunch of bonus material in the
6529020	6534140	quake two remaster. I learned that it was never actually meant to be quake two until they ran out
6534140	6538140	of time and couldn't come up with a good name and branding for it. So they called it quake two,
6538140	6542460	added a nail to the logo and called it a day. Uh, makes sense when you consider they have almost
6542460	6546380	nothing in common beyond the engine. Interesting. I never realized that that's interesting. Now,
6546380	6549660	the break man commenting on that story, the dark soccer just read saying, uh, I wish
6549660	6555260	Squeenix would give six, some of the love they give to seven. Yes. I think, I think there's a
6555340	6559260	yes. I think, I think there's a lot of expanded universes. We'd like to see for some of the
6559260	6564540	classic final fantasy games. At least we finally got the pixel remasters on consoles. Don't forget.
6564540	6567980	I mean, we had it on PC, but we got the console releases for switch and PlayStation
6567980	6571980	earlier this year. So there is that. And if you haven't checked out six and that, um,
6571980	6576060	it's very good from what I understand. I need to play. I still need to stream those games,
6576060	6579900	but here's my problem. I kind of just don't want to play Final Fantasy two. So I think,
6579900	6584620	I think I am going to skip. I think I'm going to skip and I'm going to play like Final Fantasy
6584700	6590460	four and six, and then maybe go back to three and five. Um, and then play two,
6591260	6600860	maybe as a channel point reward or something or something, or maybe I just I'll play more
6600860	6606780	tunic instead. Uh, it's probably time better spent. All right. Um, I would also like to see
6606780	6613980	a sequel to 16 for the record. I hope we get another game in the 16 universe. Um, but you know,
6613980	6616780	I still feel like there's a lot of things that could tie up in the story, but
6618060	6623580	I digress. Uh, the break band of chat says, am I the only one that didn't hate two? No,
6623580	6629180	I'm sure you're not the only one that didn't hate two, but, um, maybe tonight you are. All right,
6630780	6638220	let's move on to Loki. So this is interesting. Apparently the team behind some of the more
6638220	6646460	popular multiplayer mods for grant of five and Reddit at redemption to, um, CFX dot re
6646460	6653340	they are P coming part of rockstar games. So they're known for the, uh, mods, uh, five M
6653340	6659500	and red M, which is, I think he's more by the role-play community to play some alternative,
6659500	6665100	um, versions of the game within those two games, but now they're being rolled into
6665900	6672700	rockstar games. He says a huge step forward in the growth of our community and, uh, an opportunity
6672700	6677740	for us to work with rockstar games to advance the five M platform and the creative community
6677740	6682220	surrounding it. While our day to day operations won't have any noticeable changes with rockstar
6682220	6685980	support, we're going to continue to improve our platform. And we are truly excited for what this
6685980	6691900	means for our users, community and creators. Uh, it's funny though, because literally a few years
6691900	6698060	ago, they rockstar was kind of trashing them saying that the five M project is not an authorized
6698060	6704060	alternate multiplayer service that contains code to design to facilitate piracy. Our policy on such
6704060	6708220	violations in terms of service are clear and the individuals involved in this creation have had
6708220	6715660	their social clubs accounts suspended. Way to go rockstar games. You guys are just bang up jobs.
6715660	6721980	It's almost as if you can be more productive working with your fans that are, they smell
6721980	6726300	the money is what they did. They smell the opportunity to make money is they're like
6726300	6732540	that too. We can monetize this. That's why they're tuned. You can't monetize banning people unless
6732540	6738700	you're charging them to unban them. Don't steal that trademark patent pending. That would fly
6738700	6744140	anyway. So I think this is going to probably be a good indicator. What grand theft auto six and GTA
6744140	6749020	online two is going to look like is, you know, some more of this role play stuff in there as
6749020	6753340	well since it's been popular. I mean, yeah, a lot of people have been into it. It's really
6753340	6757660	fascinating. There's some Twitch channels and stuff that do it that, uh, is really interesting.
6757660	6763020	So it's hard to believe that this game has been out for like, I know it's almost a classic game
6763020	6769820	of the week already. Just about we'll see about that. I'll be the judge of that. Well,
6769900	6776060	Loki might say when you're sick one grand theft auto online aside, like I don't like
6776060	6781100	grand theft auto. I, I liked the idea of grand theft auto online, but they ruined it like big
6781100	6785980	time, like with what they did to it. All the monetization is just really bad, but some of
6785980	6792060	the features in it are good. This, the single player game, very good. So like, I mean it,
6792060	6798620	that stands alone on its, on its own, but yeah, online is just kind of, I like the races. I like
6798620	6805580	the world, but like charging for literally everything is just awful. All right. Well,
6805580	6809420	before we get to the listener round table tonight, I have one more story and this is going to make
6809420	6813660	some people sad, but I really don't think this news is as bad as people are making it out to be.
6814220	6820060	And that is that the Xbox game pass $1 trial is now being shortened. You used to be able to get
6820060	6826460	one month of Xbox game pass for the low, low price of $1. But now this introductory offer,
6826460	6833900	it's been halved. You only get two weeks for your $1 of Xbox game pass. And this is just
6833900	6840140	conveniently in time that star field is about to come out on Xbox game pass in a matter of weeks
6840140	6844220	at this point. Really. I think the early access is happening while I'm away at dragon combat,
6844220	6847820	the retail releases right after I returned, which would be the general game pass release as well.
6848620	6853500	So it does kind of line up that that would be a potential reason why they don't want people
6853500	6860940	playing and beating starfield for a dollar. Look, let's be honest. Many of us worked swindled,
6860940	6868140	stretched, exploited the Xbox game pass system quite some time ago. It's been years. And when
6868140	6875820	I say that, I mean, there were many people that loaded up on the dollar, the really cheap Xbox
6875820	6881820	game or gold sales, converting that into Xbox game pass for three years and all that. Look,
6881820	6890060	we've had our day times up starfield was not a cheap game to make two weeks is still not bad.
6890060	6894220	If you're really not sure if you want game pass or not, but I kind of think, you know,
6894220	6899340	at this point of game passes for you or not, and you probably should pay what it's worth to play
6899340	6904540	starfield a little bit. So, but I'm sure, look, there's still, there's still ways that people
6904540	6909260	are going to work the system hint. Cause I did this with Swiss. This is just being thrifty
6909260	6913980	on the Nintendo switch. And I know I've told the story on the show. I'm going to tell it again,
6913980	6918540	cause this works for Xbox as well. You can get at Costco and I'm sure there's similar deals
6918540	6925660	out there. You can get $100 worth of Nintendo cards for $90. And then you can use that $100
6925660	6931660	that you got for $90 to then get the two game voucher, which in turn you can use on the $70.
6935020	6939020	I'm like, what is star soccer doing with her hands? Is she mapping on her fingers over there?
6939500	6941260	I'm playing with my motion capture.
6941260	6947020	Yeah, no, it's fine. Then you can get tiers of the kingdom for $70, meaning for the low, low price
6947020	6955100	of $20, you can get a $60 retail game because you mapped the thing and you took advantage. Now you
6955100	6960380	could do a similar thing with Xbox, which I believe Costco and probably other outlets also
6960380	6967100	sell a hundred dollars worth of cards for 90 bucks. And honestly around events like black Friday
6967100	6971900	or, you know, around maybe the day after Christmas. No, usually not. Cause they want
6971900	6977100	people to spend their gift cards at full value, but usually you'll find other deals to get these
6977100	6981420	types of things like, you know, a PlayStation plus is one of them as well. You get them real cheap.
6981420	6986860	So just something to keep an eye out for you can be thrifty and there's many websites out there,
6986860	6992540	many social media feeds, uh, that help you be thrifty on your game shopping.
6992540	6999580	So, all right. Uh, let's see. YYR in chat says, if you're all in on Xbox use Microsoft rewards,
6999580	7004700	you can earn one free month of game pass ultimate every month. If you're okay with doing dailies,
7004700	7010140	using edge and being playing their games, et cetera. So basically GPU is free forever.
7010140	7014060	I was actually doing that for a long time and it was very effective. I would say I was maybe
7014060	7019740	getting every other month free, but still it's a great way to do it. They also up to the number
7019740	7025260	of points you need to redeem that now, but I'm not arguing the point because it's still a very
7025260	7031020	thrifty way to get a month here or a month there of Xbox ultimate. And again, if you want to,
7031660	7036940	you know, save up your points and redeem a couple of those at once, that might be another way to
7036940	7042140	play star field, if that's the way you want to do it. So something to think about. Oh, interesting.
7042140	7047580	YYR says the auto redeem price did not go up. I didn't realize that. That's fascinating. Okay.
7047580	7054940	Good to know. Good to know. SSG100 Matt says I always do the Costco gift card thing with Disney
7054940	7065340	cards before going to Disney world. Oh, clever, clever. Shane in chat says I use edge and I
7065340	7070060	randomly have earned like 20 bucks. And I don't know how much, how now I have, how I have that
7070060	7074700	much or whatever he's trying to say there. So what you, you can turn those into Xbox points and buy,
7075500	7079100	I think you can even turn it into windows store credit. If you're like, I don't want to hook up
7079100	7082620	my Xbox or whatever. Like you can, there's a lot you could do with that. You should look into that.
7083820	7089180	All right. Well, we should look right now at our mailbag every week. You can participate with,
7089740	7094940	you can participate with our show, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send an email.
7094940	7101340	And I think, Oh, Shane says you can turn it into PayPal money really, but it's not going to be as
7101340	7106300	good of a value. It's just money. Yeah. Money's good. Money's good. That's right. You can get
7106300	7110140	things like target gift cards and stuff on there too. So I guess there is that. All right. All
7110140	7115660	that chat aside, let's get to the emails tonight and the rest of our listener roundtables. So
7115660	7121020	Dar Sakura. I'm actually trying to check the calendar cause there's a lot of spam in here too.
7121980	7128780	So that was the, all right. Between August 31st.
7128780	7133660	I saw one today. If you can find the one from today, I think that was the only one I noticed.
7133660	7139660	Yeah. No, there were, there were a couple. There was one from, from the first and from the third
7139660	7144940	by the same person. No, sorry. This one is the spam one that it wouldn't let me delete. There
7144940	7152860	we go. All right. So yeah. Okay. Here we go. So hello, LR, long time, no email. I just figured
7152860	7157900	I'd say hello and also send a long-winded comment regarding something discussed during the last
7157900	7163340	episode and my poor broken eyes. I need to make this must be YYR because it opened hello, LR.
7164060	7170460	Yes. Okay. So Microsoft rebranded the Xbox live gold as Xbox game pass core, taking a look at
7170460	7175660	25 game library available to give us course subscribers. Loki wondered why folks
7175660	7180140	wouldn't just pay, excuse me, hiccups. Wouldn't just pay the extra $1 and opt for game pass
7180140	7185740	for console instead. But there's something there that lucky missed. Xbox game pass core provides
7185740	7192140	access to online multiplayer. Xbox game pass for console does not. So in order to have both the
7192140	7196300	real game pass and the online multiplayer, you need to subscribe to game pass. Oh,
7196300	7200940	that's shady. I miss that too. Oh my goodness. All right. Sorry.
7201580	7205500	So at the end of the day, this isn't much different from the previous setup.
7205500	7210620	After all game pass for console never included Xbox live gold before. I don't blame Loki for
7210620	7215500	getting this wrong. The only reason why he got it wrong was because the new branding is to be blunt,
7215500	7221580	absolute bullshit. If you look at almost any popular tiered service, higher tiers include
7221580	7225900	all the features of the tiers below them. These don't, which is super confusing to the point of
7225900	7231260	being anti-consumer. Frankly, I am all struck at just how terrible this branding is. I expect that
7231260	7236620	Microsoft would soon be flooded with support tickets from folks that expected online multiplayer
7236620	7243020	for the $11 tier and didn't receive it. I get that they want to say they have more game pass
7243020	7248220	subscribers than ever. And that was probably their main motivation behind this move. I get that they
7248220	7253180	want to unite all of the subscriptions under one brand because that's what a lot of corporations
7253180	7259500	do. But if that's what they wanted, I believe they should have just jacked the game pass console,
7259500	7265100	priced a few more bucks, maybe to 14 and included all the multiplayer. Yeah, it would suck a little
7265100	7269740	for the folks who aren't interested in multiplayer, but be a lot less confusing for everyone or
7269740	7274460	perhaps even better, maybe they should just have left all of this alone. We're familiar with the
7274460	7278860	current system and branding, so why mess it up at all? All right, capitalism, sigh.
7279740	7285100	Anyway, that sucks, but you know what doesn't suck? Recently, someone set a new world record
7285100	7291900	for Dance Pad speed running the original Legend of Zelda. You might ask, who you might ask? This guy.
7292540	7297340	You can check out my Twitch or YouTube channels if you're interested in seeing this,
7297340	7301500	or if you want to see a recent play test of some of the stuff I recently added to
7301500	7306460	SuperDuper Multitasking, like the fast forward feature and the new single player gauntlet mode.
7306540	7310380	But whether you check that stuff out or not, happy gaming. And of course, to our glorious
7310380	7314380	hosts, thank you again for this show and have a great week. Keep on stepping YYR.
7316380	7321020	Of course, you're the one that set the speed run for the original Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad.
7321020	7327740	This just sounds so you, and actually, you know I'm going to do this. Sorry. I'm going to pirate
7327740	7333740	some content from YYR's YouTube channel, but I will point out you can find YYR on YouTube at
7333740	7340780	YYR57695. You can find the channel there, and I'll just show you a little preview of what it
7340780	7346940	looks like to actually run the Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad, and it's exactly what you'd think.
7349980	7353500	That's, oh my God, yes, with the buttons and everything. That's incredible. Anyway,
7353500	7356380	while we watch YYR speed run the Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad,
7357500	7360140	and actually, can I say this too? How long is the speed run?
7360140	7369180	Just under two hours. YYR, you hella need to submit them. Yes, I'm using the trademark
7369180	7375420	Northern California term of hella. You should hella submit this speed run to Games Done Quick.
7377660	7381740	You really need to think about submitting the speed run to Games Done Quick. I'm just saying,
7381740	7386460	I'm just saying. Anyway, if you can, yeah, I know that means time away and all that stuff,
7386460	7390220	and you have a young one at home. But while we watch YYR do that on Twitch,
7391260	7392700	I want to mention- It just occurred to me.
7392700	7395820	What's that? I could do my rod caliber speed run.
7397260	7404620	You could. YYR says it's not quick. It doesn't need to be. They do a Kingdom Hearts run that's
7404620	7408380	like three hours long. You just have to be faster than other people doing it.
7408380	7413100	Exactly, and the fact that you're doing it on a Dance Pad is fucking funny. I don't know,
7413180	7417020	but I also know the pressure of that could be a lot, so I'm not going to push the issue,
7417020	7424300	but I am going to say YYR, this is quirky enough that I think people would eat it up. I really do,
7424300	7427580	but if you don't want to do it, I completely respect that choice.
7428380	7435740	But I do want to respond to the part in YYR's email where he talks about including multiplayer
7435740	7445500	by jacking up the price a little bit to $14 and doing that. Here's a hot take, take it or leave
7445500	7450860	it. I've been saying this for years. Why doesn't Microsoft just fucking eat the price already and
7450860	7460540	give it to you for free? Because there is this disparity as there has been for years that you
7460540	7466220	have games on the Windows Store that have multiplayer on them, and you don't need Xbox Live
7466220	7471500	to play those multiplayer. I'm not going to put that thought in Microsoft's head. They would get
7471500	7482140	eaten alive for that type of stuff though. If they want to have parity with what's going on on PC,
7482140	7489660	they really should just make it fucking free for multiplayer on Xbox console anyway. Why not stick
7489660	7495340	it to Sony when you have a chance? I don't know. It just seems a little silly to me,
7495980	7501660	but money, money, money. That's the end of the day. Money, money, money, whatever. Anyway,
7501660	7509020	thank you YYR for the email. I do notice you're doing a great job, so I don't want you to take
7509020	7514860	this the wrong way, but I am noting if you did this again and again, you probably could really
7514860	7521500	optimize this run even more. So I have a feeling whether it's on the stage of GDQ or not,
7521500	7524860	this is something we're going to see YYR do again, because this is kind of
7524860	7528540	this is kind of rad actually. I really love this. I agree.
7531580	7535660	Breakman in chat says this guy is doing better with a mat than I can with a controller.
7535660	7539580	This guy, he's right there. Breakman, he's sitting right next to you in the chat room.
7539580	7550220	Turn to your left. Well, you know, just if anyone decides to ever use Dreamcast dance pads,
7550220	7556460	the Konami logo is one of the attack buttons or that's how I beat dance caliber.
7557180	7563180	There you go. Also use Taki. We have a call waiting in the green.
7563180	7566140	I have another email. Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought,
7566140	7569180	nevermind. Just kidding. Let's do the email and then we'll do the call.
7570700	7576060	All right. This comes from Retertainment. This week, the ESRB submitted a post to the
7576060	7581580	FTC to allow companies that sell video games to utilize facial recognition software as a way to
7581580	7587740	verify the ages of potential customers. Now we can debate the effectiveness of such a proposal
7587740	7592220	as well as whether or not potential customers trust pictures to such a system, but there's
7592300	7597980	another question to be asked. Why is ESRB proposing this? I believe I have an answer.
7599180	7603900	In May, Pornhub started blocking access to users in several cities, including Utah,
7603900	7608380	instead of state, sorry, instead of Utah, over age verification laws passed in those states.
7608380	7612700	In response to that legislation, many porn sites started rolling out facial recognition programs
7612700	7616700	for its users that live in those states. From personal experience, I can attest that
7616700	7622060	the program utilized by those porn sites are similar to the program that the ESRB is proposing.
7622380	7627260	So, can it be argued that the ESRB is being proactive about potential upcoming issues?
7627820	7630620	After all, video games rank up there with porn as boogeyman and
7630620	7633900	scapegoat notes that are used by conservatives. Take care of Retertainment.
7636860	7644300	Interesting. That is so weird how they banned porn in certain states. Like,
7644300	7647340	I'm sure people just use VPNs to get around it and all that stuff anyway.
7647340	7651180	Right. They just block in IPs that come from a certain state. That's all they're doing.
7651180	7655660	Yeah. At the same time, though, I mean,
7657820	7668220	having the age verification on those sites, it's a good idea. I mean, in theory, maybe even to a
7668220	7675980	degree in practice, but you're also dealing with the potential recording of minors without parental
7675980	7683020	consent. They'll just store it temporarily, I'm sure. And then later on, it'll leak out that they
7683020	7687020	stored those images to train their AI. Some are going to argue it's still being
7687020	7693660	recorded though, whether it's sent anywhere or not. And plus, I don't see how facial recognition
7693660	7701180	software works. It's not a flawless system. And there's a lot of like 16 and 17 that grow
7701180	7706860	full facial hair and stuff. It's wild. Did I ever tell you about my friend who,
7706860	7711900	at the time, her six-year-old daughter could unlock her mother's iPhone with her own face?
7711900	7718700	Oh my gosh. Because their facial structure was like they were almost twins, just one was older.
7720300	7726700	Or identical twins actually doing the same thing. I had a friend in elementary school who went
7726700	7731500	through puberty at a super early age. He was growing facial hair in the fifth grade.
7733500	7734060	Oh.
7734060	7735100	Yeah, it happens.
7735100	7738940	I went through it in third grade at nine years old.
7738940	7741020	Wow. So I feel like-
7741980	7743820	I was the first kid with boobs.
7744620	7750940	There's too many issues with this. I mean, yeah, at least the ESRB is trying to get out in front
7750940	7755020	of it, but try again. That's my comment on that.
7755660	7761340	And YYR says, the party of smaller government and less regulation, hypocritical shitheads.
7764220	7771660	Basically, they just want to control the things that they don't agree with, like bodies
7773740	7775020	and let everyone kill each other.
7776460	7781900	Look at the stunt that was attempted in Ohio, like case in point. That's it. Anyway,
7782700	7783820	we have one more email, right?
7784620	7789340	No, that was the second one because I said we had- you said we had one. I said we had two.
7790060	7792700	Well, I see a third that came in at 634.
7793740	7794060	What?
7795580	7799660	For fuck sake. No, I don't see another one.
7801500	7802780	Oh, okay.
7804540	7811740	Hey, OLRs, Jim, Sally and Daniel here. Choo-choo babies. You guys ever play a game on Steam called
7811740	7818300	Rounds? A roguelike game, crazy jumpy, lots of goofy power-ups. It's taken over our gaming
7818300	7823580	lives. Best $6 buck worth of gaming since Minecraft. Let us know if you want to play
7823580	7826860	sometime. Chats later. XOXO, Jim, Sally and Daniel.
7828300	7833180	A short, sweet, succinct email. Love it. Yeah. Your recommendation means a lot to me,
7833180	7839260	Jim, Sally. I've not heard of it, but I do love me a cheap game. So I'll have to take a look at it.
7839260	7840380	What game was that again?
7840460	7843820	Rounds? Have you heard of this? I'm opening up my Steam.
7845980	7848540	That and I need to buy Danger-esque because it plays on Apple.
7849260	7850380	I'm actually trying to see-
7853820	7857900	So the game that comes up for me is a card game? Is that the game?
7857900	7862380	I don't think it is because they were saying it was roguelike. I'll have to find it because
7862380	7865100	the game that comes up for me when I search on YouTube is a card game and I don't think
7865100	7867500	that's the right game. It's a 1v1 roguelike shooter.
7867500	7869100	There's a link in chat.
7869100	7873260	Ah, perfect. I was looking for like a YouTube gameplay, but that's all right. Okay,
7873260	7875500	I'll check that out later after the show. Thanks for the rec though.
7876140	7879420	And it's always good to hear from you, Jim, Sally and Daniel, of course.
7879420	7879900	Choo-choo.
7881660	7885580	And thank you for being one of my many guides in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
7887340	7889340	All right. Now we're done with email, yes?
7890460	7890860	Yes.
7890860	7891820	All complete? Finished?
7892860	7893100	Yes.
7893100	7900940	Participate at orangelandradio.com. Now we can get to the telephone or in technology, the Discord.
7900940	7904780	Let's bring in our caller for tonight who has been patiently waiting. Hi,
7904780	7906460	you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7908220	7912380	Hey, what a well-timed cough from Dark Sakura.
7912380	7912940	Sorry.
7912940	7914300	I believe I heard that was Shane.
7914940	7917740	Yeah, I guess I'm passing COVID through the internet.
7917740	7920140	Oh no. Oh no, it's mutating again.
7920140	7921340	It's called garlic bread.
7922300	7924220	Well, I hope you're feeling better, Shane.
7925020	7931980	I am. I have my voice mostly back, but I went and did Pokemon Community Day today for an hour,
7931980	7934300	and that was a stupid idea.
7934300	7936540	I thought you rage quit Go, and now you're back on it.
7936540	7942540	I did, but I rage unquit too when there's a Pokemon I like, and it was Froakie.
7942540	7944380	How am I supposed to pass up Froakie?
7944380	7945020	Even I is so-
7945020	7946620	You and your water types.
7946620	7949100	It's true. It is me and my water types.
7949100	7953740	It is so fucking hot here today, and I hate how they schedule these things.
7954460	7957820	While there's a fucking heatwave going on, schedule it at the hottest point of the day.
7960140	7963260	I get it. The globe is a big place, and they need to do something that works for
7963260	7967420	Northern and Southern Hemisphere, but I'm really, really signing more and more onto
7967420	7972860	the idea that they need to let us pick from three different three-hour windows what works
7972860	7974860	best for us and do it that way. I know it's possible.
7974860	7978380	Or even just the 11 to two or two to five. That's it.
7978380	7981900	You just pick one of those two. You don't need to do three. That's just what it should be.
7982460	7984540	But it was like 90, I think, here.
7985340	7989180	But I got in the car. I couldn't find my Bluetooth Pokeball, which pissed me off.
7989180	7991420	It's somewhere hiding in the house.
7991420	7996140	But I got in the car, and I drove to one park, pulled over, caught all the Froakie there,
7996140	7999660	and then drove to the park down the street, caught all the Froakie there, and I got two
7999660	8003820	shinies. I was like, you know what? One of these is a two-star. Good enough for me.
8003820	8007820	I'm done with Froakie Community Day. I'll catch up in December when the weather is better.
8007820	8011900	Well, I timed it for right after seeing the Barbie movie.
8011900	8015100	So I just went from the Barbie movie to go catch Froakie.
8015100	8015900	Let's go see it.
8016460	8023100	It's so good. It is so good. I cannot sing its praises enough. I want to see it again.
8023100	8025820	For some reason, I'm actually surprised to hear this from you. You don't strike me as
8025820	8032380	the type that usually likes those kind of quotably silly comedy movies. It depends on the movie.
8032380	8039420	Honestly, the humor was my type of humor. I did not expect that. And I loved so much,
8039420	8042060	and I laughed so many times.
8042060	8045740	Phil of Nine says, OMG, go see Barbie. What are y'all waiting for?
8045740	8050700	So not to be a downer, but I do want to just gently remind. I was in Atlanta the weekend
8050700	8054940	that it came out, and then my dad got really sick the next weekend, which was earmarked.
8054940	8057180	I should have seen it this weekend, but I just didn't get around to do it.
8057180	8058060	You were supposed to go.
8058700	8060620	Yeah, I know, but things.
8061580	8066460	So I do want to I want to brag that for my one hour of playing today,
8066460	8070060	I did get 30 froakie shinies. So I was happy.
8070060	8071020	You're disgusting.
8073500	8076860	All right. What did you want to call it? You didn't want to talk about go with us tonight,
8076860	8077660	though. What do you want to know?
8077660	8082300	But I, of course, want to talk about Pokemon because it's like the only thing I live and
8082300	8088620	breathe. So you guys talked about Pokemon presents, but you left off something very
8088620	8095180	important from presents in that they showed off four new Pokemon in Scarlet and Violet.
8095180	8097980	Oh, that's right. The redos, right?
8098700	8105180	It's not. Well, I don't know what you mean by redos, but no, no, it's not just that. So
8105180	8113180	they did show off Raging Bolt and Iron Crown, which are paradox forms of Raikou and Cobolion.
8113180	8113680	OK, that.
8114320	8119680	Yes, but beyond that, they had two new evolutions for previously
8119680	8125920	existing Pokemon. Applin, which debuted in Galar Gen 8,
8127680	8134880	used to only be known to evolve into Flapple. And I don't even remember the other one.
8134880	8137520	That's the fat stupid one. I don't remember what his name is.
8138480	8146160	But now he has an evolution called Diplen, where he looks like a candy apple. It's adorable.
8146160	8149360	Yeah, I did. OK, I did see that. It was cute.
8149360	8155040	And then Duraludon, also from Galar, has an evolution, didn't have one before,
8155040	8160880	into Archiludon. He just looks like a bridge. I actually kind of dig it. It's neat.
8162560	8164160	But that's what you...
8164400	8168400	One of them looks like that monster from Horizon Forbidden Dawn.
8168400	8172160	That is Raging Bolt. Yes, it looks like a Tallnick from
8172160	8176800	Horizon. Because that was in the VR demo thing I saw at Bobby's.
8176800	8185280	Yeah, it's ridiculous. But more importantly than Pokemon Presents was that Pokemon Worlds
8185280	8193120	ended this morning in the US around like 3am. And they had a whole bunch of new information
8193120	8200160	for their various games. The first being Pokemon Unite, they announced three new characters.
8200160	8206960	Blaziken, Mimikyu, and Meowth Skirata. So the grass cat is already in that game,
8206960	8214880	which is frustrating. The Pokemon TCG is adding two new types of cards, Ancient and Future,
8214880	8219280	but we don't know what they do. But for Scarlet and Violet DLC,
8220240	8227440	the part two, the indigo disc, is adding all gen one through eight starters in the wild.
8227440	8232880	You'll be able to catch them. A 19th teratype. I don't know what you're doing on screen. Are
8232880	8238000	you riding a roller coaster? I don't get it. It's... Jamie's avatar looks like it literally
8238000	8241680	passed away. Like when you were talking about Pokemon.
8241680	8245600	Oh, I see it. Yeah. I was just trying to mimic it because it was so funny.
8245600	8249120	Like we just both died because you won't shut up about Pokemon.
8249120	8253280	No, I don't. I will talk about till everybody's dead. I don't care. It's fine.
8255200	8263360	And so 19th teratype. And there's also new competitive moves that like one blocks healing
8263360	8270560	from abilities and moves. And that's pretty cool. Also Pokemon Worlds next year is in Honolulu,
8270560	8278720	Hawaii. So I very much want to go. I've already decided. Japan looked like a lot of fun. Way more
8278720	8283760	fun than Fan Fest, which was the two things I wanted to decide between this year. So I'm gonna
8284640	8286880	there's no Fan Fest next year. I want to go to...
8286880	8291040	Now, don't spoil the video because I want people to go to our YouTube channel and check out your
8291040	8295280	Fan Fest reactions in the video. You already do sound better today than you did even three
8295280	8296880	days ago in that video, though. So...
8296880	8303120	Yeah, I've got everything I had back then except my voice is back. So everything else is fine.
8303120	8303620	Yeah.
8304580	8311860	Oh, but yeah, that's all the Pokemon news. And I did. I did buy Baldur's Gate 3 because
8311860	8316820	I'm getting sucked into the hype. I have not played it yet. Because, you know, Steam has
8316820	8323060	that two hours and you can refund it or with whatever within two hours. So I haven't even
8323060	8327780	turned it on yet. I'm waiting for a period of like two hours straight where I can just kind of
8327780	8331700	try it and see if I like it. Because it looked a lot like Dragon Age to me.
8332260	8333780	Oh, what?
8333780	8335220	So why can't it be two hours gay?
8337220	8343140	Whatever. That's stupid. Anyway. Yeah. So I'm excited to play that because it looked like
8343140	8347300	Dragon Age Origins to me. I was like, well, I love that game. So maybe this will be...
8347300	8351700	No, it does. It does give me big Dragon Age vibes, actually. Which is funny because Baldur's Gate is
8351700	8356260	like, it's actually like an old classic. Like, those games have been out before. Like, it's
8356260	8359780	number three for a reason, right? It's been years since it's been a long time since 2.
8360580	8365540	But like, they're very classic, well known, you know, PC games. But yeah, I never got into them.
8365540	8370820	I'm almost tempted to buy three. Shane, if I buy three, will you create a character that we can
8370820	8374420	play together like on stream or something? Well, you know, I love creating characters.
8374420	8379220	So I would probably be down for that. I just have to make sure I'm down for the game. Because I asked
8379220	8383380	somebody, would I like it? Explaining, you know, I only... I've never played D&D. I don't know
8383380	8386740	anything about that stuff. But I've played Dragon Age. I was like, oh, this looks like Dragon Age.
8386820	8390980	And like, yeah, but there's a lot of dice rolls. I'm like, that's fine. That usually just happens
8390980	8397060	behind the scenes. So I'm sure it'll be okay. I mean, I've played D&D. To be quite honest,
8397060	8403140	like a lot of what we see in role playing games today is because of D&D. So like,
8404340	8408740	if you were to play D&D, you'd be like, there's a certain familiarity to this, because I've played
8408740	8415940	literally any RPG, you know? Yeah. And I hear there's like, just so much in terms of like,
8415940	8422820	branching story paths, and just like, all these little things that affect the overall outcome.
8422820	8429860	Like, that sounds very overwhelming and scary, but also very cool. Because like, I can't play
8429860	8435220	Mass Effect anyway, but one way. All my decisions are exactly the same when I play it. So I don't
8435220	8439620	know how I would handle a game like this. That would just break me. Especially when I'm doing
8439620	8444100	things to intentionally and deliberately shock you. Yeah, and then I will just kill you.
8446820	8452420	I'm gonna tell you when Baldur's Gate 3 caught my attention. So please plug the kids ears for
8452420	8457540	a minute here. It was when they showed that scene where you can like, fuck the bear. I was like,
8457540	8463780	that that's in a video game. I didn't even watch that. It's a druid thing. Like the druid shape
8463780	8470180	shifts and they, you know, Discovery Channel, etc. So I was like, this is incredible. What is
8470180	8475220	this game? I need to have it. I did see that they like, I saw like a patch notes where they had to
8475220	8480580	fix penises. I was like, this is hilarious. Like, this game is going to be amazing.
8481860	8486180	All right, or something. Well, we have another call waiting to get on. So,
8486180	8489940	Shane, I'm gonna let you go. But thanks so much for joining us tonight. I appreciate it.
8490500	8495300	No problem. Bye. Take care. Bye. All right. As I promised, we have another call waiting
8495300	8499700	to come on air. So let's do it. Hello. You are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8501140	8507700	This is Choo Choo Jim Sally. Jim Sally. Jim Sally. Always a pleasure to hear from you.
8507700	8514020	Is Daniel with you too? Daniel is asleep in bed, so now we may speak at an R-rated level.
8514020	8518500	Oh, good. I'm glad to hear. He stayed up just long enough to hear you guys read our email
8518500	8524020	from today. He's fucking on. That's awesome. I love that. I'm glad he didn't hear the part
8524020	8529780	about the bear. That's what I did. That's the last one. I just turned down before you call.
8535860	8544900	Yeah. I'm hoping that animal kingdom thing and not a Toronto church and lovely kind of thing.
8544900	8550260	It's hashtag just druid things. So what's on your mind tonight, Jim Sally? To what do we
8550260	8557380	all the call? Well, I was good about also, I'm just finishing this J. I was good about that
8557380	8562900	round game that I'm talking about. Yeah. So one versus one game where you shoot each other and
8562900	8569140	then the loser gets to pick a little power up. Like maybe they jumped further or they have poison
8569140	8573620	bullets or some shit, and then you fight again. And then the loser of that next battle gets to
8573620	8580660	win. And my boy has been still obsessed with this game. It's been, it's unbelievable. When I think
8580660	8587700	about how much money I've spent on other games for him to die in a day or two. But this stupid
8587700	8593700	$6 one v one game. It's just tucked them in. I think I think they put something in the background
8593700	8598180	where it flashes that it hypnotizes you or something. Is this the game on here that I just
8598180	8605060	put onto the discord? Oh, you got it. This is it. Okay. This is all it is, man. It's it's the
8605780	8611060	I can't believe it. This looks like the type of video game that they have playing at conventions
8611060	8616500	that have time. Okay, I see the power ups. Okay, I get it. This was a type of video game like stick
8616500	8623300	fight a whole bunch of people are crowding around a TV. It's giving me big. Oh, fuck. What's that
8623300	8628500	10 player Killer Queen? I'm getting big Killer Queen vibes. We were we were there when Killer
8628500	8633860	Queen was just being introduced. Yeah, they had one at Southern Fright. And funny enough,
8633860	8638660	on the plane ride, very random aside on the plane ride out to Atlanta from Sacramento,
8638660	8643540	I met a guy that works with Killer Queen. And he was going to the same show. And I overheard him
8643540	8647620	in line. And I was like, he's like, Yeah, I'm going out to Atlanta for a gaming show. And I just,
8647620	8651220	you know, you know, me, I'm not shy sometimes. I was like, are you going to Southern Fright Game
8651220	8655380	Expo? I turned around. He's like, Yeah. And so we ended up talking. I saw it was really funny.
8655380	8660020	So cool. I wish I'd got his business card. I would have invited them on the show. But I
8660020	8661620	thought I'd see him at the show and I never did.
8663620	8664980	Well, still, yeah.
8666180	8670820	That game does look really fun, though. For $6. I checked that out. And there's a shit ton of
8670820	8677380	YouTubes out there. My goodness. Oh, my God, it's unbelievable. We actually saw one the other day I
8677380	8682980	cracked my my modding cherry the other day, and actually learned how to mod a video game on the
8682980	8689780	PC for the first time. Really? You'd be so proud of me. I download all of us who play The Sims.
8690740	8696740	I know, right? I know, right? Or Minecraft. All the 12 year olds in my life know how to do it on
8696740	8704100	Minecraft. I didn't want to ask them because I felt stupid. Not us getting to that age where
8704100	8708580	the 12 year olds are showing us how to do things that was when I was 12. That was programming the
8708580	8714020	VCR. That was the thing that, you know, my parents who were, you know, in their 50s at the time had
8714020	8719380	to rely on the youngins to do is program the VCR. So my mom didn't know how to do it. And I
8719380	8725460	understood the whole concept of if you put it on EP, you get six hours of tape, but it doesn't look
8725460	8730340	as good because it uses less tape. Like she didn't understand any of that. She was just like,
8730340	8738580	can you just tape Oprah or not? Brother, I remember one day trying to explain to my parents
8738580	8744420	about getting a second VCR so I could copy the videotape from the jumbo video. And it took me
8744420	8749460	like two months of arguing with them and they wouldn't believe me. And then finally I had to
8749460	8754500	borrow a second VCR from, this was eight years ago, kids, so copyright doesn't matter. Okay.
8754500	8761300	It can bring the second VCR to my house. But I still remember my mom's face,
8761300	8764340	like almost in tears that we were going to get free movies.
8765380	8769540	Well, and also this is how you, you know, get over the ring virus.
8773940	8779380	The funny thing about the videotape thing is that it's now starting to hit its nostalgia
8779380	8783220	thing because you know what I'm seeing shared on social media now is things like
8783220	8789140	I just found Titanic on VHS and we're watching it and fully having to switch the tape out and
8789140	8793940	all that. And somebody else just yesterday on one of my feeds was like, I just found
8793940	8801620	it still sealed the Star Wars release on VHS. It had a very distinct like look with the,
8801620	8805780	like it was when they re-released it. Uh, I think it was after the initial initial release,
8805780	8809540	they like re-released it like THX sound or whatever was the fancy thing. And it had a
8809540	8814660	very unique like logo and like it was unopened and they were like, should I open it to watch it?
8814660	8817460	What? I have those laser disks.
8817460	8819540	Oh my gosh. Yeah.
8819540	8823540	I do. And guess what? We got them at Dimple for 11 bucks each.
8823540	8824580	Oh, that's funny.
8824580	8828660	Back in the day. Of course, I also have just a spinal tap with the guitar pick on it too.
8831540	8833700	And Questbuster Han shot only.
8833700	8839780	I love that a Jim Salley phone call is here to tell us about a new video game and suddenly
8839780	8844820	descends. Uh, of course, of course we need the conductor of the train here to drive this tangent
8844820	8861300	train into a talk about VHS videotapes. Don't tape over Rob's Alice in Wonderland from TV
8861300	8865060	cause he'll get pissed. Carol Channing was in that, that, that, that. Anyway.
8866820	8870820	I still remember the day my GM, they drove me over for fucking Dancing with the Stars.
8871700	8872020	Oh no.
8872020	8876820	Fucking Dancing with the Stars. That was like the biggest heartbreak ever when you pop it in
8876820	8881220	and Dancing with the Stars comes up. And I just want to watch some Cobra Commander. I even had
8881220	8885780	the, I even had the game series where that weird snake guy came over and there was an extra snake
8885780	8891860	serpent or, and then they would all go and attack and shit. And it was fucking Dancing with the
8891860	8898900	Stars, man. I had the whole run of Ronin Warriors taped off of VHS when I had my VCR set timed.
8898900	8903700	And I realized that my VCR would actually start recording 25 minutes late. So I set it 25 minutes
8903700	8910580	earlier. So I had every episode and then my brother taped over all the episodes with my
8910580	8914980	favorite character who is Seiji, which I mean, I have them all in Japanese now, but still.
8914980	8919140	Several people in chat, several people in chat are bringing up cause dark soccer mentioned the
8919140	8923140	beta max. There's several people in chat bringing up that they too had a beta max. And actually in
8923140	8930340	my family, we also had a beta max first. And that was when I fell in love with clue the movie. I had
8930340	8938340	clue the movie with all three endings on beta. And I wore that fucking tape out. I was seven
8938340	8941380	years old. Oh yeah. That was the big, that was the big thing with that movie. There were three
8941380	8945140	different endings when they released it in theaters, you would only see one of the three
8945140	8950180	endings. And it was, it was actually like in retrospect, there's a lot written about how that
8950180	8955220	was actually horrible and detrimental to the movie's box office success because that movie
8955220	8961620	found its footing when they would show it on TV over and over again on like, for me, it's channel
8961620	8966820	31, but it's whatever your local independent, you know, a TV channel is. It just shows the movies
8966820	8973700	all day long. They, they, and so many of us in that, you know, young, uh, you know, late Gen X,
8973700	8979460	early millennial generation, like grew up watching clue the movie on TV over and over again with all
8979460	8984580	three endings because they put it on VHS is had all the endings there and same thing on TV.
8984580	8989380	That was one of my, one of my movies on repeat that the princess bride and high spirits.
8989700	8997700	I love all day long. Yeah. Oh, good times. All right. Jim Sally, I'm loving this, uh,
8997700	9001860	walk down memory lane, but I do have to wrap up so we can wrap up the show tonight, but Jim Sally,
9001860	9006820	it's always a pleasure to hear from you. I'm going to check out rounds and, uh, please, uh,
9006820	9011700	please send our best to Daniel. Okay. I will do probably good night, everybody.
9012020	9021460	You take care. All right. Always a delight to hear from Jim Sally. What a guy, uh, I'm glad he's
9021460	9025460	back. He's been gone for a little bit and it's, it's really nice to have him back in the circle.
9025460	9029140	Now it's, it's like, uh, being reunited with an old friend. I appreciate it. Absolutely.
9029140	9034340	Absolutely. Um, okay. Uh, we're getting towards the end of the show. Uh, I want to make sure we,
9034340	9038180	uh, wrap up here and, uh, get the final thoughts out and all that good stuff. Uh,
9038180	9042740	dark soccer. I know you are off to do your streaming thing. Um, so do you have a final
9042740	9052100	thought for our listeners tonight? Um, only one, uh, one quote, so I chose to expose myself,
9052100	9056180	please. There are ladies present. All right. Thank you. Excellent. All right. Perfect.
9056180	9060900	Uh, I'm going to get on the Debbie train. All right. Later taters. Good luck. Have fun with
9060900	9065860	that. All right. We'll see you in a little bit. Um, as always, I want to thank everybody for
9065860	9068980	listening to orange launch radio tonight. If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show,
9068980	9072660	tell a friend or to help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has
9072660	9077140	a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air. So a nice five star review on a site like
9077140	9082340	iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way. So, uh, would
9082340	9090180	super appreciate all of that. Um, with that, I think we're down to the other final thoughts.
9090180	9092340	So, um, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9092980	9098740	Uh, my final thought was there was another game I played for my gaming week. I forgot to mention
9098740	9105380	it. Um, it's, it's basically one of those, you know, how you have all those spam, um,
9106900	9111780	mobile game ads that have like, you know, you're no, never be smart enough to beat this type of
9111780	9118500	thing. And they have the weird games on there. Well, they actually released a game that has those,
9118500	9123780	uh, all in one collection. It has the most ridiculous title. It's called, yeah, you want
9123780	9129380	those games, right? So here you go. Now let's see if you can clear them. That's the name of the game
9129380	9136820	by the way. It's fun. All right. And then, uh, the other thing is, uh, there's going to be some major
9136820	9145700	announcements next week. Just saying. Yes. Uh, on both from both of our ends. Yes, absolutely.
9145700	9150260	I'm excited. Yours is real good though. That's all I'm going to say. All right. Um,
9151220	9157060	so my final thought tonight, and you can blame dark soccer for this is well, someone's got to
9157060	9160420	break the ice and it might as well be me. I mean, I'm used to being a hostess as part of my
9160420	9164100	husband's work. And it's always difficult when a group of new friends meet together for the first
9164100	9167860	time to get acquainted. So I'm perfectly prepared to start the ball rolling. I mean, I have
9167860	9172180	absolutely no idea what I'm doing here, what we're doing here, what this place is about, but I am
9172180	9176580	determined to enjoy myself and I'm very intrigued and oh my, the soup's delicious, isn't it?
9177860	9181060	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Have a wonderful night,
9181060	9185380	everybody. We will see you in seven days time. Take care. Good night.
