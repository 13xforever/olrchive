Devolver Digital presents Devolver Delayed! Devolver Digital delayed delights that need

00:13.960 --> 00:18.280
more development. Developers decided to dedicate more days to deploying their delight. Despite

00:18.280 --> 00:22.120
the delay, more days should allow for improved design and increased delight. There are a

00:22.120 --> 00:26.000
lot of synonyms that start with the letter D. Hopefully decade doesn't become one of

00:26.000 --> 00:29.680
the relevant ones. This is the intro brought to you by the letter D. Now it's time for

00:29.680 --> 00:33.520
your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you the details of this D story

00:33.520 --> 00:36.760
and the rest of the week's gaming news. Study tonight now on the show where every gamer

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
has a voice.

00:37.760 --> 00:46.880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:46.880 --> 00:54.320
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode

00:54.320 --> 01:01.920
number 970 of our show for tonight, August the 13th of 2023. Yes, we're back after an

01:01.920 --> 01:06.440
unexpected two weeks. Well, one expected week off and then one unexpected week off. I'll

01:06.440 --> 01:10.800
talk about that in a moment. But first, let's introduce ourselves. I am Rob Roberts. I'm

01:10.800 --> 01:15.080
here every week joined by my co-hosts. Say hello first and foremost to the one and only

01:15.080 --> 01:16.720
DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:16.720 --> 01:17.720
Hi.

01:17.720 --> 01:23.120
Hello. Or should I say the virtual, the V2 virtual tubing?

01:23.120 --> 01:27.760
I'm actually having to fix the setting real quick. There we go. I was like leaning over

01:27.760 --> 01:30.980
for some reason. You know, gravity.

01:30.980 --> 01:35.280
And you can see visuals like this because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine

01:35.280 --> 01:39.720
o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog

01:39.720 --> 01:43.200
network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can see the visuals that go along

01:43.200 --> 01:47.960
with the show. I mean, we do know we're a podcast and we make it audio only first. We

01:47.960 --> 01:52.160
try very, very hard to not say things like, look at what's on the screen, you know, but

01:52.200 --> 01:56.920
sometimes when there's something very much outside the ordinary, ordinary, we might stop

01:56.920 --> 02:01.820
and point it out such as DarkSakura's VTuber, which I know you've used on your personal

02:01.820 --> 02:07.080
streams here and there over on your Twitch channel. But I guess she's making her debut

02:07.080 --> 02:09.760
on OLR tonight.

02:09.760 --> 02:16.240
And this is even a new look for my VTuber because I finally got my hair right.

02:16.240 --> 02:21.400
And how has the VTubing experience kind of been for those that may not know or maybe

02:21.400 --> 02:22.760
understand VTubing?

02:23.760 --> 02:30.760
Well, it's been interesting because it's great that I don't have to put on makeup and change

02:30.760 --> 02:38.840
out of my pajamas. So my skin has benefited from it. You know, it means I don't have to

02:38.840 --> 02:46.880
have my my lights on all the time, which is also good. It's a but it's been kind of interesting

02:46.880 --> 02:56.320
because I don't feel like this heavy judgment for how I look, you know, it's, I mean, that's

02:56.320 --> 03:00.560
kind of the thing. It's great for introverts. And while I don't really mind being being

03:00.560 --> 03:07.520
on camera, I do have those days where just I hurt, you know, and I don't want to or I'm

03:07.520 --> 03:14.200
having like lately I've been having dizzy spells of migraines. So I haven't really had

03:14.200 --> 03:18.760
a lot of the ability to get up. This shirt is clipping. I'm going to have to fix it.

03:18.760 --> 03:26.880
But anyway, but it's also taught me a bit more about texturing just in 3D anyway, which

03:26.880 --> 03:38.080
I was learning a bit of how to do that when I'm working in Daz. But overall, I've really,

03:38.080 --> 03:45.280
you know, I think that camo is picking up my my audio too. And I should I normally have

03:45.280 --> 03:50.280
that turned off. You actually sound completely fine on my end. But I think what is happening

03:50.280 --> 03:53.960
unfortunately might have a little bit of a loop situation going on. I don't know why

03:53.960 --> 03:57.920
my OBS is reverting some settings, but I think what I just did will fix it. So sorry about

03:57.920 --> 04:01.920
that. Thank you live chat pointing that out. Sorry, audio folks. No, you sound fine. I

04:01.920 --> 04:08.880
think it's on OBS's end. And I double checked my settings are fine. But at any rate, it's

04:08.880 --> 04:15.480
been an overall positive experience. And I've been able to, you know, the thing I enjoy

04:15.480 --> 04:21.240
about it really is customizing my clothes. Although the boobs are kind of hard to work

04:21.240 --> 04:27.840
around just the way that they they sort of bend textures over it. But I'm learning to

04:27.840 --> 04:32.440
deal with it. You know, I have I have all kinds of different cute stuff. I even have

04:32.440 --> 04:39.960
like my ballet day outfit, which will be seen tomorrow, where I have a bun. And I have like

04:39.960 --> 04:44.920
a leotard under a big shirt. And I borrowed an image from a sticker and I'll give them

04:44.920 --> 04:52.800
full credit for it. But it's it has a ballerina with her feet in fifth position, which is

04:52.800 --> 05:01.400
I can't do it on the camera. But and it says I plead the fifth to I also have one that

05:01.400 --> 05:05.240
says May the fourth be with you. And it's a ballerina in fourth position with a lightsaber.

05:05.240 --> 05:11.640
I see. I see. All right. Yeah. Funny. Funny. Quickly, before we introduce our other co

05:11.640 --> 05:17.120
host here off of YouTube for a second, I wanted to mention quickly this because this was a

05:17.120 --> 05:22.320
little bit newer for a Vogue network of something trying a little bit of an experiment trying

05:22.320 --> 05:27.560
to create some additional content for our website and the network outside of just Sunday

05:27.560 --> 05:32.660
nights as well as our affiliate podcasts. So on Thursday, we put together a couple of

05:32.660 --> 05:37.080
videos that just went out on our YouTube channel. So we are creating some content that we do

05:37.080 --> 05:42.160
mean to distribute and not keep exclusive to Twitch. And in all transparency and honesty,

05:42.160 --> 05:45.620
it's just an effort to try to grow our network and have more content that's available for

05:45.620 --> 05:50.520
consumption out there. So Shane and I got together to talk about Final Fantasy 14 Fanfest.

05:50.520 --> 05:55.680
So you can check that out over on our YouTube channel. Or if you need the links, Vogue network.com

05:55.680 --> 06:02.200
is a great place to start. And then Dark Sakura and I got together to talk about the new alien

06:02.200 --> 06:06.840
DLC for Dead by Daylight that's coming. Oh, yeah, we took a deep dive on that because

06:06.840 --> 06:12.640
Dark Sakura has some pretty strong opinions when it comes to alien or aliens inspired

06:12.640 --> 06:20.480
DLC. And this is alien. No, I know. I know. Yeah. So but obviously, a lot of it's most

06:20.480 --> 06:24.000
people are fond of both the first two movies. I don't see a lot of people defending the

06:24.000 --> 06:29.080
third one out there. I like I actually like the third one. I like resurrection because

06:29.080 --> 06:33.560
I love Winona Ryder. And I was like, if they're not going to get Sigourney Weaver, which they

06:33.560 --> 06:37.240
didn't spoil I mean, they got Ripley was not Sigourney Weaver, right? It's a it's a made

06:37.240 --> 06:40.920
for TV version. But it's pretty decent. We talked we talked about this in the video.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.280
We talked about this video. But I was like, if they don't get that, I hope they get Winona

06:45.280 --> 06:49.000
Ryder's character call or whatever her name was from resurrection, because then we can

06:49.000 --> 06:54.680
get her that one. And then we can get Joyce Byer from Stranger Things. And we'd have Winona

06:54.680 --> 07:00.680
and Winona on the same team. I'd love that. If they ever get the Stranger Things license

07:00.680 --> 07:05.480
back. I know but that's what I want. I want Winona on Winona action. And to answer fifth

07:05.480 --> 07:12.060
James question about Jonesy. Jonesy is in the game. Yep. As making little cameos. There

07:12.060 --> 07:16.840
is a locker that you can open. That's near a jump scare area. I won't spoil that too

07:16.840 --> 07:24.560
much. And he runs out of the locker going. And and he's also in Ripley's loading screen.

07:24.560 --> 07:29.880
And she plays with him. He comes up from behind her and weaves through her legs and she leans

07:29.880 --> 07:32.640
down and gives him scritches and then he gets scared and runs off.

07:32.640 --> 07:36.000
I was gonna say I didn't think the fourth movie was terrible. I'm a little fond of it

07:36.000 --> 07:39.020
because it was the first one I saw in the theater and it was by that, you know, alien

07:39.020 --> 07:43.240
is a big director franchise, or at least it was right. And it was the guy that did the

07:43.240 --> 07:47.080
City of Lost Children directed the fourth movie. So it's got a very stylistic look to

07:47.080 --> 07:53.000
it. And it was written by at the time, this person was huge, obviously, some time and

07:53.000 --> 07:57.280
some looking back, there's shown that this individual is not great. But Joss Whedon wrote

07:57.280 --> 07:58.280
it, you know,

07:58.280 --> 08:02.480
there's more drama behind that, because they changed the script a lot. Oh, okay. I thought

08:02.480 --> 08:10.000
his there are there are places in there that have a lot of his original writing. But there's

08:10.200 --> 08:16.400
there was quite a bit that was changed. So where it doesn't end up as quite his style

08:16.400 --> 08:20.440
of movie, if that makes sense. So anyway, there's some drama, I would encourage you

08:20.440 --> 08:24.080
to check out our YouTube channel if you're not already following it at of course, vog

08:24.080 --> 08:27.760
network, vog network and check out all the latest Speaking of socials real quick, and

08:27.760 --> 08:34.160
then our third host is sitting there so patiently. I will mention, we are also now on blue sky.

08:34.160 --> 08:37.920
So for those of you that have decided, you know what billionaire platform, not for me

08:37.960 --> 08:41.880
so much. We now have a presence on blue sky as well. And I'll let you guess where you

08:41.880 --> 08:48.920
can find us on blue sky. Yes, it's vog network, although the way blue sky works, you can actually

08:48.920 --> 08:54.040
get verified to your particular domain. So you actually look for vog network.com on blue

08:54.040 --> 08:58.560
sky. And that's how you that's that's its version of a verified account is because it's

08:58.560 --> 09:03.560
verified through the actual vog network domain. So but I'm pretty sure we're the only vog

09:03.560 --> 09:09.760
network on blue sky as of right now. So all right. Anyhow, they have another invite code

09:09.760 --> 09:13.800
somewhere if anyone needs it. Oh, yeah, it was funny. The vog network account got an

09:13.800 --> 09:18.920
invite code to maybe I shouldn't say that. But you want to know what's great, though.

09:18.920 --> 09:25.520
Because I'm because I'm on an Apple silicon Mac. I can run the blue sky app on my Mac

09:25.520 --> 09:29.520
so I can actually play with it from my desktop. Oh, well, they have a website too. I mean,

09:29.520 --> 09:34.400
yes, I just use the website. They do but it's kind of weird to get to they're really

09:34.400 --> 09:40.640
pushing the app presence. I will say though, quick pro tip on blue sky, if you want to

09:40.640 --> 09:44.760
change your content filters the way you want them, and I'm just going to be straight up

09:44.760 --> 09:50.320
if you want to see adult content, you can't do that on the app due to App Store restrictions

09:50.320 --> 09:56.160
on all platforms, not it's just all platforms. So you want to bring it up on the web to see

09:56.160 --> 10:00.760
all of the content filtering options, because by default content filtering is on. So if

10:00.760 --> 10:04.000
you want to see other stuff, you can go in and face it. But if you don't want to see

10:04.000 --> 10:08.060
that stuff, you can also just turn the filters on the way you want them. That's one reason

10:08.060 --> 10:14.040
I like blue sky a lot is that it is very customizable. Something it has that billionaires app doesn't

10:14.040 --> 10:20.460
have is custom beats, which is pretty rad too. So it's it's it's it's a neat app. I

10:20.460 --> 10:23.140
like where it's going. They've had some they've had some growing pains. Not everything has

10:23.140 --> 10:28.820
been sunshine and rainbows, but it's much better than the alternative, in my opinion

10:28.820 --> 10:35.460
so far. So all right, uh, let's say hello as well to of course the one and only tech

10:35.460 --> 10:42.420
master Loki. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm tired. Yeah, tired. Busy weekend. It's been a whole

10:42.420 --> 10:47.700
busy week. I've been just doing lots of stuff. Lots of things going on. Okay, hopefully something

10:47.700 --> 10:52.380
we can hear about in the future. Yep, hopefully. All right. Next week. Okay, but here's what

10:52.740 --> 10:56.460
the listeners really wanted over that I should say the viewers tonight over at vog network.

10:56.460 --> 11:01.620
Why in the hell do you have that game playing behind you tonight? What is that? That's that's

11:01.620 --> 11:10.560
the Sega hologram time travelers or time it is a time. Yes. It is because, uh, well, we've

11:10.560 --> 11:17.700
done how many shows starting to run out of games? I don't know about that. Do you know

11:17.700 --> 11:23.780
how many classic games dark soccer has picked over the years? Go to the Wiki page and just

11:23.780 --> 11:29.260
start going in order from what she's picked. No, I picked it because like I remembered

11:29.260 --> 11:35.100
that this game existed. Thankfully, I was not smart enough to play it. So, you know,

11:35.100 --> 11:43.100
I don't know that it's awful, but, um, yeah, this ties in also to my, my final episode

11:43.140 --> 11:47.500
of channel 64 as well. There's time travel involved. So, okay. Okay. I see what you're

11:47.500 --> 11:53.580
doing. Very, very loose like connection there. But yeah, um, I don't know. You were promoting

11:53.580 --> 11:57.260
something earlier on your socials about like a tour, like you were letting people come

11:57.260 --> 12:01.740
on your island. How was, how was all of that for Minecraft? Yeah, we did a world tour and

12:01.740 --> 12:06.780
it's actually still up if we're going to be keeping it up for a week. Um, but yeah, our

12:06.780 --> 12:13.020
tour server, um, it, we invited people on, we, well, we first did like a podcast type

12:13.020 --> 12:16.920
thing talking about season two and then we invited Ray on to like a world tour, had people

12:16.920 --> 12:21.860
walk around. We, uh, went and played some of the mini games that we had set up during

12:21.860 --> 12:28.860
the year and stuff. And, um, we had chaos at the same time. Someone teleported every

12:29.100 --> 12:36.100
single entity in the game in one spot. That was fun. We had to fix that. I was worried

12:36.100 --> 12:40.580
you'd get trolls or something that would want to do. No, no, we, we set it up. I mean,

12:40.580 --> 12:45.460
our community's great. Um, it's set up as a, an adventure mode world. So anybody knew

12:45.460 --> 12:51.260
that comes into it, it said they can't break it. I mean, the worst they could do is maybe

12:51.260 --> 12:56.060
kill the ravagers or something. It, nothing that's like unfixable and it's just temporary

12:56.060 --> 13:00.780
anyways. And it's not, it's a copy of our server. It's not like actually the server

13:00.820 --> 13:06.940
that we play on. So, um, yeah, they can't really hurt anything, but it's more of like

13:06.940 --> 13:11.060
to get to view stuff first person because like some of the builds you don't really understand

13:11.060 --> 13:15.100
until you act like screenshots don't do them justice, but when you go and see them in person,

13:15.100 --> 13:20.300
like, Whoa, these are huge or like these are really cool looking. Um, so it gives a chance

13:20.300 --> 13:23.720
for people to kind of explore things at their pace and then plus there's going to be a world

13:23.720 --> 13:29.380
download coming out at the end of next week when we start our third season. So, um, they

13:29.380 --> 13:33.140
can check it out then too. And we're still working out kinks with stuff are none of our

13:33.140 --> 13:38.140
resource packs work because apparently they changed the format of those. So that's great.

13:38.140 --> 13:44.140
Wish I knew that a couple versions ago. Um, and just been trying to work through like

13:44.140 --> 13:49.140
updating mods and everything like the proprietary mod that I made, I updated, but then the one

13:49.140 --> 13:55.340
that works with that not updated. So we had to do some crazy workarounds to get things

13:55.340 --> 14:00.260
to look fine on there. But I think it might be, I think it might be fun, uh, as a deep

14:00.260 --> 14:04.260
dive video sometime, Loki, if, uh, you and I are you and somebody hop on there, I've

14:04.260 --> 14:09.420
just been at some point, it won't always be me. I'm doing this to get it started. And

14:09.420 --> 14:13.420
then other people might go, I want to do one. And then of course, this isn't the Rob show

14:13.420 --> 14:18.060
it's fog network. So, um, but I think it would be great if you and I did a deep dive and

14:18.060 --> 14:21.460
you could explain it from the perspective of, I haven't touched Minecraft in like 10

14:21.460 --> 14:26.260
years. Like why, you know, what is it take to do something like this? And I'm like, I

14:26.260 --> 14:27.740
think that'd be a lot of fun.

14:27.740 --> 14:33.020
Lots of planning and then also lots of regret and burning yourself out because you committed

14:33.020 --> 14:37.540
to something that was supposed to be going to the end of the year. And then we cut it

14:37.540 --> 14:42.980
short by six months. And then instead of, you know, saying, oh, I'll just do less. You

14:42.980 --> 14:48.780
just decide to cram more of it in a shorter time period and then have like, you know,

14:48.780 --> 14:54.100
a whole week of sleepless nights because of this and yet to be announced things I can't

14:54.100 --> 14:57.980
wait to, can't wait to talk about, but I cannot about them yet.

14:57.980 --> 15:06.540
I know, I know them feels bro, but we will talk about that next week and how my life

15:06.540 --> 15:15.340
flip upside down would say, uh, is it is going to be an insane month. That's for sure. A

15:15.340 --> 15:17.940
very emotional, insane month for sure.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.820
All right. Uh, some other comments on your video game, uh, playing in the background there,

15:21.820 --> 15:26.460
time travelers tonight from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, pod culture

15:26.460 --> 15:31.180
suggests you could run naughty bear or Yaris if you want to do a bad game. Uh, the break man

15:31.180 --> 15:36.460
saying, LOL Yaris. I don't think Loki has ever done Yaris before. I think I'm pretty sure I've

15:36.460 --> 15:42.220
done Yaris. I haven't done naughty bear. Um, I, yeah, it was more of just like, I was trying to

15:42.220 --> 15:46.140
think of arcade games and I'm like, well, you know, I've done all these and I couldn't think of

15:46.140 --> 15:52.460
any that like were interesting to me that I haven't done before polarizing that game is like

15:52.460 --> 15:56.300
the brake man says it's the worst game I've ever played. As you went on to Matt says, that game is

15:56.300 --> 16:00.220
hilarious. I'm assuming in a so bad, it's good kind of way. But questmaster says that was such a

16:00.220 --> 16:05.820
bold game by Sega. And if you think about it, the technology really was like, it was some,

16:05.820 --> 16:09.820
that's what made it even more disappointing. Cause you're like, wow, it's a hologram game. And he

16:09.820 --> 16:14.700
played like, wow, this is awful, but it looks cool. Yeah. And you look at something like

16:14.700 --> 16:18.940
dragon's lair, which I would consider dragon's lair kind of like the predecessor to that,

16:18.940 --> 16:22.860
which is a great game. And like the Don Bluth, you know, animations, that whole series really,

16:22.860 --> 16:27.500
but with space ace and all the other stuff, uh, that was incredible. And so I feel like they were

16:27.500 --> 16:31.660
trying to emulate that in the hologram space kind of with this game. And it just, it wasn't the

16:31.660 --> 16:36.860
same. They should have called Don Bluth. Yeah. It's like, it's hard with like full motion games

16:36.860 --> 16:42.700
like that, where it's just like, okay, well, the, the gameplay is going to be jumping duck or left

16:42.700 --> 16:48.780
and right. You know, it's, it's very like basic controls because they can't really change full

16:48.780 --> 16:53.580
motion video nowadays. I mean, if you were to remake that, it would be just, you could do all

16:53.580 --> 16:59.260
sorts of crazy stuff with that. So it's just the, it, you know, they did the best they could at the

16:59.260 --> 17:05.900
time and it is what it is. All right. Well, uh, we're going to jump into our kickoff topic here

17:05.900 --> 17:09.500
in a moment. I'm going to ask Loki to jump into it. Cause we usually like to try to get to gaming

17:09.500 --> 17:13.020
right at the top of the show, but we do have a few things to catch up on. I just kind of want

17:13.020 --> 17:18.460
to go over a few things because we haven't been here for two weeks. Um, so there's a few things

17:18.460 --> 17:23.740
to talk about so quickly. Um, I was not here two weeks ago and this was planned because I was at

17:23.740 --> 17:29.100
Southern fried gaming expo out in Atlanta, which was a lot of fun. Uh, basically it was a really

17:29.100 --> 17:36.380
celebration of all different types of game forms, um, notably pinball console games, uh, classic

17:36.380 --> 17:41.260
arcade room gaming. And, uh, it was a lot of fun. I will urge you to go check out the Bobby

17:41.260 --> 17:46.220
black Wolf show from two weeks ago where we really took a deep dive on that. I was a surprise guest

17:46.220 --> 17:51.420
on his show. I guess the only one to ever be in person because I was at his house literally.

17:51.420 --> 17:55.740
Uh, so we did that show together two weeks ago. So that was a lot of fun. Um, and so we get into

17:55.740 --> 18:00.220
a lot of the details there, but I did have a really good time at the show. Um, I, I really

18:00.220 --> 18:06.140
wish I could justify the expense of traveling back so I could go say, yes, I'll be back next year.

18:06.140 --> 18:10.940
I'm not going to say I'm not going to be there next year, but it's going to take a lot to get

18:10.940 --> 18:16.220
me, you know, obviously with the, um, travel costs and all that. But if I lived in the state or I

18:16.220 --> 18:19.900
lived in the Atlanta area, or even if I lived in Florida or something within driving range,

18:19.900 --> 18:24.540
you bet I'd drive out and go to the show. Cause it was a fun time. You know, it was, it was that

18:24.540 --> 18:28.860
a very similar, it was a good dragon con warmup because it had that very similar vibe of like

18:29.500 --> 18:35.420
literally Bobby, Mrs. Black Wolf and I stayed up until 3 AM one night. I never left West coast

18:35.420 --> 18:42.300
time pretty much. We stayed up until 3 AM one night playing a kingdom hearts, PVE card with no

18:42.300 --> 18:46.940
dice game. Um, that was actually a lot of fun and we were having to learn the rules and everything.

18:46.940 --> 18:51.340
And I got to play as Donald and I joked, I'm not going to heal anybody because I'm Donald.

18:51.340 --> 18:56.220
Although the gag was, um, I actually ended up doing a lot of healing, uh, throughout the game.

18:56.220 --> 19:00.780
And I, I feel like, I feel like you can't really do well at that game without Donald,

19:00.780 --> 19:04.140
who was like the only one who could do direct healing. But anyway, I digress.

19:04.140 --> 19:07.900
We had a lot of fun playing that game and kind of learning about that. I enjoyed, uh,

19:07.900 --> 19:11.660
going through the classic game room and playing a lot of the classics. They had new tables there

19:11.660 --> 19:16.940
too. Uh, Stern was in full force. They were showing off their new venom table. I didn't,

19:16.940 --> 19:22.380
I didn't love the venom table. I think the venom table is probably great for people who love the

19:22.380 --> 19:27.740
classics because it doesn't have as many bells and whistles. Like there's no, like there's no

19:27.740 --> 19:31.980
third flipper on the venom table, which for some people are going to be like, good. That's how

19:31.980 --> 19:36.380
pinball should be. Um, and that's, they'll like that table, but I liked the Foo Fighters table,

19:36.380 --> 19:40.700
which I'd played before, but for the first time I got to play the double O seven, uh, table,

19:40.700 --> 19:44.780
which is in two flavors, depending on which edition of the game it is. But I love the, um,

19:44.780 --> 19:49.340
no one lives forever with a little, uh, James Bond and the helicopter pack that's around.

19:49.340 --> 19:53.420
I thought that was so cool. So I love that. And they had the weird Al table, Dark Sakura,

19:53.420 --> 19:59.420
uh, with the, and they had it flipped out. So do I. I know, right. I heard about that,

19:59.420 --> 20:03.900
but they had one that was flipped out. Cause that pinball maker lets you flip out like the back

20:04.460 --> 20:08.060
and for like another game. And so they were showing another game with that as well,

20:08.060 --> 20:12.300
which I thought was pretty cool. Um, and then of course all the classics as well. Uh, I know I

20:12.300 --> 20:16.380
played a space Harrier machine and I took a picture and send it to dark soccer and I put, look,

20:16.380 --> 20:21.820
I'm entering the fantasy zone and getting ready. Get ready. That's right. So I played that, um,

20:22.460 --> 20:27.180
uh, just, yeah, I played some really cool indie games. They had a little indie showcase,

20:27.180 --> 20:31.100
but there was just some fun stuff that was being shown. I really hope there's some stuff that gets

20:31.100 --> 20:35.660
to publishing and all of that. It was really good. I love the vintage computing expo and getting to

20:35.660 --> 20:41.420
see like the old three 86 and four 86 computers that were playing doom, uh, and that were all land

20:41.420 --> 20:45.500
together. So you can, and what was neat about it was that it was really kids sitting down and

20:45.500 --> 20:52.300
playing it and, uh, playing those. So yeah, just lots of fun stuff to see just a real celebration

20:52.300 --> 20:57.980
of gaming. Uh, and I had a lot of fun. Again, we have a very, very, very similar show out here

20:57.980 --> 21:02.540
called California extreme, but I will say, and granted, I haven't been to California extreme in

21:02.540 --> 21:06.140
a few years, Jamie, you've been more recently than I have. So correct me if I'm wrong, but

21:06.140 --> 21:11.660
California extreme really focuses on the pinball and the classic games. I don't remember as much

21:11.660 --> 21:18.060
board game stuff and like Pathfinder and things of that sort. The pinball stuff has actually gotten

21:18.060 --> 21:25.020
bigger over time and they do. And they do also have the, um, the candy cabs with, uh,

21:25.660 --> 21:30.940
the bullet hell games. Oh yeah. There were some of those that, um, Southern fried too, but yeah,

21:30.940 --> 21:35.660
I just, the game room was definitely like bigger at California extreme. Like there was more variety,

21:35.660 --> 21:38.940
but I don't want to pit the shows against each other. They're both a lot of fun.

21:38.940 --> 21:42.460
They're just, there's subtle differences between them and that's okay. You want to see shows grow

21:42.460 --> 21:47.100
into their own thing. So I just, I found Southern fried to be like a big like celebration of gaming

21:47.100 --> 21:51.180
and yeah, I definitely encourage those in the Southeast part of the country to, uh,

21:51.180 --> 21:55.980
put it on your agenda to go next year. Uh, I'm sure Bobby Black Wolf will be back as far as me.

21:55.980 --> 22:00.220
I'm a question mark until I know what my finances and all that look like for next year and what I

22:00.220 --> 22:06.460
may or may not get offered to do. We'll see. Um, now unexpectedly we weren't here last week

22:06.460 --> 22:13.420
and that was pretty much the situation on my end. Um, my dad had to go to the emergency room on

22:13.420 --> 22:18.060
Saturday and when we took them into the emergency room, it was pretty, it was sounding pretty

22:18.060 --> 22:21.820
serious. The doctors were diagnosing him with sepsis when he first went in. Unfortunately,

22:21.820 --> 22:26.700
he had an infection that got a little bit out of control, which was weird because he wasn't like

22:26.700 --> 22:30.940
showing signs of something that was like completely out of control until, you know,

22:30.940 --> 22:34.540
it was too late, so to speak, but I'm going to just fast forward to the end of this.

22:34.540 --> 22:39.420
He's fine. Now the sepsis was not that they kind of caught it like right on the borderline

22:39.420 --> 22:44.460
and were able to pump them full of antibiotics as one does. And, you know, my dad's 84. Like

22:44.460 --> 22:49.900
he just, he, you know, you get infections easier at that age. He had had a procedure done. Um,

22:49.900 --> 22:54.380
and I'm just going to say in a personal area, and that's why I'm not giving details because this is

22:54.380 --> 23:00.460
my dad's business. He had a procedure done and unfortunately it let it potentially led to this

23:00.460 --> 23:05.900
infection by, you know, um, dislodging things or, you know, whatever, just the way these things

23:05.900 --> 23:09.420
happen. He didn't, you know, and my dad is still a little bit stubborn in his old age,

23:09.420 --> 23:13.820
so he doesn't like to speak up that something's wrong until something's really wrong. And, uh,

23:13.820 --> 23:18.540
so we took him into the ER and there was that. So I wasn't sure if he was going to get discharged

23:18.540 --> 23:22.940
on Sunday or what was going on. So I kind of told my co-host like, Hey, I don't know what's

23:22.940 --> 23:28.940
going to happen today. And so we just kind of decided, you know what, no show. And honestly,

23:28.940 --> 23:34.380
I ended up appreciating just like having a weekend because my Saturday and Sunday morning

23:34.380 --> 23:39.340
had been completely shot by everything that was going on. Understandably. So I would do it again

23:39.340 --> 23:44.460
if I needed to, but I like to be able to take Sunday night to just like do me and decompress.

23:44.460 --> 23:49.740
Decompression. Yeah. Well, and Rob, I have to, I have to say that when you said sepsis,

23:50.620 --> 23:57.500
I got intensely worried. No, I saw what you got worried, but yeah, I get it. Yeah.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.900
You know, that's what, that's what got Barbara. Yeah. Uh, it's, it's no joke.

24:01.900 --> 24:08.860
Right after having started chemo. Yeah. That's why anybody, if, if you've had surgery at any

24:08.860 --> 24:15.980
point in the last, I'd say year, two years, and you're feeling like you're, you're starting to

24:15.980 --> 24:21.580
feel feverish, you're feeling really exhausted. You're feeling, um, I'm trying to think of what

24:21.580 --> 24:27.260
some of the other ones are, uh, like you don't have an appetite, um, guessing the moment that starts

24:27.260 --> 24:32.140
getting. If you are 84 years old or really at any age, you really should have a working

24:32.140 --> 24:38.300
thermometer at home, which I won't get into. And if showed, if said thermometer shows that

24:38.300 --> 24:45.740
your temperature is 102.9 degrees, you probably should go to the ER. I'm not a medical professional

24:45.740 --> 24:50.620
and I'm not here to give advice. However, I can just share my personal experiences with all of

24:50.620 --> 24:56.860
you. Again, the good news is he's fine and he's back to his old stubborn self. So, um, but now,

24:57.020 --> 25:01.820
he gets some free nurse visits to come check up on him, uh, and all that good stuff for a little bit.

25:01.820 --> 25:07.420
So, um, that's also quite welcome right now. So anyway, if you need someone to get fussy,

25:07.420 --> 25:14.220
you just tell me, I got it. I'm around enough fussy people in my family. So yes, he's at home.

25:14.220 --> 25:18.220
He's okay. He might even be watching this right now. In which case, sorry, dad, I'm spilling all

25:18.220 --> 25:22.540
your business, but the listeners want to know, and I hope you see all the love for you in the

25:22.540 --> 25:26.700
chat right now. My dad does sometimes lurk in here, just so you know, he's, he's seen the show

25:26.700 --> 25:32.380
and he asks about both of you. Um, so I haven't seen your dad since he drove us to the airport

25:32.380 --> 25:39.900
that time to go to packs. Yeah. And, and we took a really crazy long route.

25:41.180 --> 25:46.140
He, he does ask about you cause he'll go, how's your friend that works at place you work and

25:46.140 --> 25:50.700
he'll like, yeah, he'll, he'll always ask me that. So he, he knows who you are for sure.

25:51.660 --> 25:58.300
Well, well tell him, tell him I'm doing fine and that I was very, very concerned for him. So yeah.

25:58.860 --> 26:03.580
Yeah. But, but no, I have to say hi to your dad sometime.

26:03.580 --> 26:09.740
Absolutely. I'm sure he'd welcome that. Um, so, uh, anyway, so, so that's what happened last week.

26:09.740 --> 26:15.500
So, you know, I hate to miss two in a row, but, and then here's the real kicker earlier today,

26:15.580 --> 26:20.940
our power went off at noon and I got an automated message from our fiber internet provider that

26:20.940 --> 26:26.140
says your internet is estimated to be down for nine to 10 hours. And I sent a message

26:26.140 --> 26:31.340
via cell phone or I was like, Oh my fucking God, am I going to get screwed again? You've got to

26:31.340 --> 26:37.260
be shitting me. Like, what did we say on the last episode to piss off the cosmos? Like my God, but

26:37.260 --> 26:41.100
obviously we're here. Uh, the internet came back when the power did, but that was still a little

26:41.100 --> 26:47.180
bit scary for sure. All right. And they, thank you. Thank you for the understanding in chat.

26:47.180 --> 26:52.460
I know this is me when I say, I say, I hate missing two in a row because I know that being

26:52.460 --> 26:58.140
a regular is not a great thing for podcasting and broadcasting all that. But I, so I appreciate all

26:58.140 --> 27:03.180
of you that are still here on the tangent train. Uh, even after two missed episodes,

27:03.180 --> 27:08.140
speaking of missed episodes, we won't be here labor day weekend as is tradition because I'm

27:08.140 --> 27:15.420
going back, back, back again to Atlanta to go to dragon con. Um, I, um, I'm going to be hosting

27:15.420 --> 27:19.820
some panels again at dragon con this year. I'm not ready to talk about them tonight because

27:19.820 --> 27:26.940
I'm very superstitious. And, um, I, I, I don't believe anything until I see it printed in the

27:26.940 --> 27:33.420
book or in this case published to the program, but I will say I'm potentially going to have the

27:33.420 --> 27:38.940
biggest panel I've had. Uh, and I will say it's with a voice actor, Loki. I see you nodding cause

27:38.940 --> 27:43.900
I may have spilled the beans before the show. It's, it's a, it's a voice actor. Um, and it

27:43.900 --> 27:49.100
could be the biggest panel I've done and I'm really excited about it. Uh, so not just for that,

27:49.100 --> 27:56.460
but just like who it is, uh, is a huge resume. Uh, and I'm just, I'm really stinking excited

27:56.460 --> 28:00.140
about it. So stay tuned for next week. I can't wait to spill the beans on that. Cause I'm hoping

28:00.140 --> 28:04.460
the app was supposed to go live already and technically the app went live, but it went live

28:04.460 --> 28:09.660
with fake data. So when it goes live with real data, I will be happy to share all of the details

28:09.660 --> 28:15.500
on that. So check that out. Um, one other thing I want to say, and then we can get into this week's

28:15.500 --> 28:20.540
gaming news, but this is important too. I just want to take to, uh, take a moment to acknowledge

28:20.540 --> 28:28.620
and send thoughts and are just, uh, aching hearts to the people affected by the fires and Maui,

28:28.620 --> 28:33.980
um, over in Lahaina, which is a place I've been to several times. Actually. I went once when I

28:33.980 --> 28:39.340
was younger. Uh, and then I went there on a very important trip when I saw my friend get married

28:39.340 --> 28:45.260
out there in 2009. And this was the year before I met Alan and the year after I broke up with my

28:45.260 --> 28:50.780
ex. And so that trip was kind of a trip that I did by myself to go to a wedding. And I actually

28:50.780 --> 28:55.340
drove up to Lahaina and I spent the day there. And I remember shopping there. I ate at the

28:55.340 --> 29:01.260
hard rock there, which actually closed down, I think in 2017, but I have, I saw the tree

29:01.260 --> 29:04.780
there that everybody's been talking about this week and so forth. And I have a lot of fond memories

29:04.780 --> 29:11.580
of Lahaina. And so to see what has happened there has just, it's absolutely broken my heart. Um,

29:11.580 --> 29:18.380
and so it's just, I just want to acknowledge and say my heart and my, I'm so sorry to everybody

29:18.380 --> 29:22.140
that's, that's going through that. It's, it's just, it's awful. It's awful, awful, awful.

29:22.780 --> 29:27.660
I read a very interesting story though, about that, where there was a couple that was like

29:27.660 --> 29:31.740
stuck in the middle of town with fire all around them. Like they, they would have died.

29:32.460 --> 29:38.700
Um, but they had like the, the, the Apple emergency thing that contacted, that does

29:38.700 --> 29:44.940
cellular emergency, not cellular, but, uh, satellite emergency. And they were able to,

29:45.580 --> 29:50.860
through text messages, direct the rescue crew to where they were and got them out of there.

29:50.860 --> 29:54.380
That's really impressive that they were able to get in there through that fire,

29:54.380 --> 29:57.660
because it sounds like that fire was moving fast and it was just so they,

29:57.660 --> 30:01.900
they're very, I'm very happy to hear that they were very lucky, but as we know, there are,

30:01.900 --> 30:06.460
I think 95 people and counting. I don't remember the number because unfortunately it keeps going

30:06.460 --> 30:10.220
up. And that that's the part that's even more painful to hear about, um, that are,

30:10.220 --> 30:15.980
that are going through that. So, um, I, I, one of the tech sites. Yeah. I, I urge you,

30:15.980 --> 30:21.500
if you have, um, the money available, please donate to a, uh, reputable charity.

30:21.500 --> 30:26.220
Please be careful. There are, um, people out there that unfortunately try to profit off of

30:26.220 --> 30:30.700
these types of situations. Please do. I'm not going to tell you who to donate to. There's

30:30.700 --> 30:34.140
many choices out there, but please do just a little bit of research and make sure that

30:34.140 --> 30:39.180
you're donating to a reputable and respectable organization. But there are many out there helping

30:39.180 --> 30:43.980
with the situation that's going on in Maui. Um, the red cross might be a great place to start,

30:43.980 --> 30:47.820
you know, but again, I'm going to leave it up to you and your decision, uh, with that.

30:47.820 --> 30:51.020
But I just want to acknowledge and just, you know, that just, I'm so,

30:51.660 --> 30:56.700
I wanted to take Alan there someday and now, you know, I mean, obviously they will rebuild it,

30:56.700 --> 31:00.780
um, but it won't be, it won't be the same, you know, it's, it's still really sad to hear about

31:00.780 --> 31:05.420
it and it's, it's going to have this history kind of hanging over it, which is really, it's just,

31:05.420 --> 31:11.820
which is, is just so sad to think about. So anyway. Yeah. I found, um, a link to it on,

31:12.060 --> 31:17.980
Gizmodo. So awesome. So I put it in the chat for people, um, as to show on how to Matt says my dad

31:17.980 --> 31:22.620
was out there and stayed in that same town last month. Yeah. There's, I mean, there's Lahaina is

31:22.620 --> 31:27.500
one of the big towns there's, um, on the other side of the Island is Hana. And there that's

31:27.500 --> 31:31.980
a very special thing because you got to go, that's the windy roads. It's very famous. So Hana is like

31:31.980 --> 31:35.820
way on the other side of the Island. Kihei is where I stayed when I went. And that's like the

31:35.820 --> 31:42.860
other big tourist areas. Kihei. So, um, yeah, but Lahaina is, you know, obviously huge tourist town

31:42.860 --> 31:46.140
is just, yeah. Tragic. Um, as you don't have to Matt says, my dad was out there and stayed in that

31:46.140 --> 31:50.780
same town last month. So sad about what happened there feeling for the locals who had businesses

31:50.780 --> 31:55.420
there for ages. And there was a lot of that. Like I, I talked about the hard rock, but there was a

31:55.420 --> 31:59.500
lot of, you know, family owned, but I went into an independent clothing shop and I will never forget

31:59.500 --> 32:03.900
the story of the rest of my life because the person was so excited to tell me, you know,

32:04.540 --> 32:08.780
Britney Spears was here shopping last week and I had that moment of, Oh,

32:09.420 --> 32:20.060
I'm standing on Holy ground right now. So, but, but to think that that shop is like 99%

32:20.060 --> 32:24.140
likely gone at this point, just, it breaks my heart. Cause that was a family and independent,

32:24.140 --> 32:27.900
um, you know, type of place. So anyway, I just wanted to acknowledge that before we got into

32:27.900 --> 32:33.100
the fun video games stuff. Um, and just, you know, I, I don't think we have any listeners impacted

32:33.100 --> 32:38.300
by that, but by golly, if we do, um, my heart goes out to you and your family. And, you know,

32:38.300 --> 32:41.980
I'm sure many, some of you out there probably have family members who were, so just, you know,

32:41.980 --> 32:47.420
our hearts going out to you. Okay. Let's shift gears. We got some gaming news to talk about this

32:47.420 --> 32:52.380
week. Let's start it off a kickoff topic for the first time in a few weeks. Loki what's our big

32:52.380 --> 33:01.500
first story tonight? Uh, it is a remake of wipeout being done by an individual Dominic. Uh, I'm not

33:01.500 --> 33:09.740
going to try to butcher this, uh, we'll just go by his name, uh, Phobos lab. And, um, they are,

33:09.740 --> 33:16.460
I'm going to guess Zabel Zebelsky, Zebelsky, Dominic Zebelsky. Okay. We're going to go with

33:16.460 --> 33:21.260
that. That's cool. I didn't want to butcher it too many constants in there. Um, anyways,

33:21.260 --> 33:30.860
so it is a remake, uh, wipeout, and this was kind of a hobby project being done using the leaked,

33:30.860 --> 33:39.420
uh, source code that came out back in 2022. Um, that was from the PlayStation and then, uh,

33:39.420 --> 33:47.180
Dean threw all that basically to rewrite the entire thing from scratch. And because apparently

33:47.180 --> 33:51.580
the way they described it, that it was a mess, it was basically a bunch of different versions

33:51.580 --> 33:58.220
of the game kind of layered on top of each other. And so they had to completely gut everything and

33:58.220 --> 34:04.140
rewrite the engine and all that so that it would work and compile to, you know, modern PCs.

34:05.260 --> 34:11.260
And it looks cool and you can play it in your web browser, which is pretty nice. If you go to

34:11.260 --> 34:19.100
phoboslab.org slash wipe game, you can play the original wipeout. There's apparently also some

34:19.100 --> 34:24.860
other versions that are being made with the source code as well. Wipeout phantom edition is supposed

34:24.860 --> 34:32.060
to take the original game and also add features to it. Whereas this one is mostly just a remake

34:32.060 --> 34:38.860
of the original game. Now I find interesting about this kinda that he doesn't seem to give

34:38.860 --> 34:42.540
a shit what Sony thinks about this, which is what I kind of find to be the interesting element,

34:42.540 --> 34:46.460
especially considering as you talked about this, this kind of is born of leaked source code.

34:46.460 --> 34:53.660
This seems especially, um, bold we'll say, right. Cause he's, he basically said that there's,

34:53.660 --> 34:58.140
you know, either let it be or shut this thing down and get a real remaster going.

34:59.020 --> 35:07.340
This is basically, there's no way to play the original wipeouts on any modern hardware.

35:07.340 --> 35:14.620
It's only available. They have the wipeout Omega collection. Um, and you know, I guess you can

35:14.620 --> 35:19.180
emulate old, you know, PlayStation games through like, you know, PlayStation now or something like

35:19.180 --> 35:24.460
that, but there's not, there's no way to play wipeout on any of those apparently. Right. Well,

35:24.460 --> 35:29.740
I guess the Omega collection, you have that, but it's not really the original game, I guess.

35:30.620 --> 35:34.140
I just want to acknowledge real quick, sorry, in chat, they're talking that Omega Loki came out

35:34.140 --> 35:38.780
there for a minute and you'll hear that on the podcast. I switched scenes in OBS. And for some

35:38.780 --> 35:44.220
reason, all of my audio settings have reverted across the board. And I have like some looping

35:44.220 --> 35:48.060
audio, which is what you really heard there. If I don't shut it off. So for some reason,

35:48.060 --> 35:52.540
all of those unmuted themselves. So sorry about that. I'm just really a robot. It's fine.

35:52.540 --> 35:56.700
Everything's broken after two weeks of no show. So sorry about if you just heard that on the

35:56.700 --> 36:01.820
podcast feed. It was not you. It's on our end and don't disappear for two weeks because everything

36:01.820 --> 36:07.980
breaks when you're gone. Just putting that out there. Yeah. Um, yeah. So basically it's just

36:07.980 --> 36:13.660
kind of not really worried about it because he considers it abandoned where as well,

36:13.660 --> 36:17.900
especially like the PC version of it, you know, that was from like Windows 95 era

36:18.460 --> 36:21.020
and stuff like that. So, um,

36:22.540 --> 36:26.700
you know, yeah. Interesting. Interesting comment from Y Y R who's in our chat. Hello. Hello.

36:26.700 --> 36:31.740
Saying what we need now is wipe out Omega collection for PSVR too. Unfortunately,

36:31.740 --> 36:35.900
that's probably never happening because the dev was shut down. I wonder if that's

36:35.900 --> 36:39.900
potentially what's causing the legal end of this to be a little slow too. I'm not sure.

36:40.700 --> 36:44.780
I mean, I know Sony isn't as litigious as Nintendo, but I still,

36:44.780 --> 36:50.460
I still don't believe zero GX or something like that. They'd be like, I know I still,

36:50.460 --> 36:53.500
I still have a hard time believing Sony is going to let this stay up. I just think they move a

36:53.500 --> 36:59.580
little slower. That's all probably. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. I thought I saw

36:59.580 --> 37:03.180
an article somewhere too along these same lines. Cause I want to bring it up that somebody was

37:03.180 --> 37:08.220
trying to recreate PlayStation home and it was a very similar type of thing where they were just

37:09.100 --> 37:12.060
talking about that a while ago. Yeah. They were doing it in the, yeah, that's right.

37:12.060 --> 37:15.660
It did come up in the show and they were doing that kind of in the face of Sony too, where it's

37:15.660 --> 37:21.500
like either, either make a new one or shut this down. You know what? Cowards. Yeah. It's just,

37:21.500 --> 37:25.420
yeah. It's very interesting. Interesting how people want to fight Sony.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.580
I mean what they've done with the Spiderman license and everything. I can see the reasons

37:31.580 --> 37:36.300
behind wanting to take up arms against them. Wipe out such a fun game though. I'm glad,

37:36.860 --> 37:40.860
I'm glad it's. Make a new wipe out. I mean, come on, what's stopping you?

37:40.860 --> 37:47.980
I'd love that. I, there is one of the wipe out games is in the PlayStation plus library.

37:47.980 --> 37:52.460
I'm pretty sure. I don't think it's the original original is one of the other ones is maybe the

37:52.460 --> 37:57.100
one they did on PSP. I can't remember, but I feel like one of them is available there. So.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.820
Yeah. So they described it like the source of the leak or whatever they said the quality of

38:01.820 --> 38:08.220
the leak source is abysmal. It says it contains the Wipeout ATI 3D Rage Edition.

38:09.340 --> 38:15.980
And it was, I guess, something that they said they bundled with ATI GPUs and had versions of

38:15.980 --> 38:21.740
the game or parts of the game from like Wipeout PlayStation and the Windows 95 version, also a

38:21.740 --> 38:27.660
Wipeout 98 directory. That was the one that they compiled in the ATI Rage Edition. They're saying

38:27.660 --> 38:33.180
there's some other stuff talking about how the game had been modified to work with the PAL

38:33.180 --> 38:38.140
versions, you know, changing the physics calculations for, you know, PAL regions. So

38:38.140 --> 38:46.540
25 FPS instead of locked to 30. Yeah, it's an interesting story. If you go to Phoboslab.org,

38:46.540 --> 38:51.180
though, they have a whole blog post talking about the entire rewrite and all the like

38:51.260 --> 38:58.220
stuff that they had to do. And many, many times mentioning how awful the code was,

38:58.220 --> 39:04.460
which I think is pretty funny. Some comments in chat, Tiger Claw is saying a new Wipeout in 4K

39:04.460 --> 39:08.460
should be the ultimate version that has all tracks from the previous games. And it needs a kick ass

39:08.460 --> 39:11.820
techno soundtrack. Well, of course, you need to kick ass techno soundtrack. Yeah, you don't have

39:11.820 --> 39:16.460
a futuristic race. I would just buy it for the soundtrack. But the compilation that was kind of

39:16.460 --> 39:22.540
the Omega collection was kind of that. So really just do it. upscale the Omega collection. Like

39:22.540 --> 39:27.420
just I'm just thinking like how good that would be now with a PlayStation five and stuff like that.

39:27.420 --> 39:34.060
You could totally do it for exactly I mean, like you could push it that much more and it would

39:34.060 --> 39:40.460
just be so amazing. And then put it in VR and it would be just do it. I mean, come on. Well, and

39:40.460 --> 39:45.500
then you know, and then since you're Sony, you can just spin it off into a movie and people would

39:45.500 --> 39:50.780
watch that too. I mean, Gran Turismo gets a movie. Why we are in chat says I do have to say Wipeout

39:50.780 --> 39:56.140
Omega collection on PS VR one is probably the most intense thing I've ever experienced in VR

39:56.140 --> 40:00.220
so much so that I could only handle one race. I had to take the goggles off, catch my breath

40:00.220 --> 40:04.860
and balance then quit. It was nuts. I don't think I got around to playing that in VR. But I know

40:04.860 --> 40:08.700
because they went back and patched it in at some point, but I can imagine it's a pretty intense

40:08.700 --> 40:15.820
experience and how fast that game moves. So neat. All right. Let's move on and talk about the types

40:15.820 --> 40:19.340
of games that we've been playing this week. I'd be curious if anyone's been playing Wipeout.

40:19.980 --> 40:23.980
Let's do how was your gaming week and go around and see what folks have been playing. Dark Sakura,

40:23.980 --> 40:29.900
how about you? How was your gaming week? I played of course Dead by Daylight with

40:29.900 --> 40:42.220
Shayla here, of course, who is the killer whisperer, I guess. I have played Live Alive.

40:42.220 --> 40:50.220
I finished the mecha character. I finished that story yesterday. I kept wanting to sing

40:50.220 --> 40:57.900
along with the giant robot music. It was fantastic. I've only got, I think, three scenarios

40:57.900 --> 41:04.540
left to do before doing the big end game scenario. What else? Oh, yeah. I started Disney

41:04.540 --> 41:09.500
Dreamlight Valley. I will be playing it again tomorrow night after ballet because it's chill

41:09.500 --> 41:14.940
vibes. It makes me happy. I saw you playing that a little bit. Although I'm annoyed at the fishing

41:14.940 --> 41:20.460
part. It's like, why does Mickey have to come watch me fish? Piss off, Merlin. I always want to fish

41:20.460 --> 41:29.820
by myself. Like when, wow, when I fish and no one bugged me. But anyway. Oh, you're very welcome,

41:29.820 --> 41:34.940
Jim Sally. Jim Sally has been a regular visitor in my channel and I've been super happy.

41:36.060 --> 41:39.660
I was lurking a little bit this week and I saw Jim Sally in there and I wanted to go say hi,

41:39.660 --> 41:42.700
but I was on, I didn't have my keyboard. So it was on the TV.

41:42.700 --> 41:48.940
Yeah. Okay. I actually have like a small TV keyboard, like a Bluetooth keyboard that I

41:49.020 --> 41:53.740
could give you. Uh, maybe we'll see. Yeah. Cause I can always hook that up to Xbox. Yeah.

41:53.740 --> 42:00.940
I can find it. Um, so I also, uh, played, uh, what else? Video game did I play?

42:00.940 --> 42:04.460
I was going to say quickly on the farming thing. I'm sorry. I just want to point this out. And I'm

42:04.460 --> 42:09.100
curious if this has ended up on your radar, but this, this game just exploded on Twitch

42:09.100 --> 42:12.700
this week. I feel like, or maybe in the last two weeks, because it, yes. You knew where I was

42:12.700 --> 42:19.820
going. Polia. What, what, what's your take on that? Well, I can't play it until, well, unless

42:19.820 --> 42:24.780
there's an app, a Mac version I have to find out. Um, and I got a link from a friend to,

42:24.780 --> 42:30.460
to join in on the beta there. Um, but I watched, uh, my friend, uh, Raven McPherson play it last

42:30.460 --> 42:35.820
night and it is pretty chill vibes. I was, I was pretty down for it and I think, uh,

42:36.460 --> 42:42.460
I would enjoy it. Um, although I'm still waiting for the Activision sale to finish. So that

42:42.460 --> 42:49.020
dude is gone and I can play well again. Um, but, Oh yeah. I remember what else I played last night.

42:49.020 --> 42:54.060
Um, uh, last week I played over the past two weeks. Sorry. I played a GQ. Oh, she buried

42:54.060 --> 43:01.100
Parodius for a super Famicom. And I played some of gone. I played some final fight guy.

43:02.060 --> 43:10.140
Um, play a little bit of F zero. Um, I played a little bit of, uh, Rondo of blood for PC engine.

43:11.020 --> 43:17.660
Um, I played some Saturn stuff because I was testing out my Saturn thing. Um, radiant silver

43:17.660 --> 43:25.100
gun. Um, and, uh, what was the other Saturday, Saturday when I was playing, uh, gun bird,

43:25.100 --> 43:34.860
a little bit of gun bird. So that was, that, that, that was it. Oh, and I do now have my, um, copy

43:35.580 --> 43:40.380
of robot Monday. And I'm going to be playing this shit out of that. Oh yeah. I also played

43:40.380 --> 43:48.380
Strider too. That's a lot of game, but there's the cherry on top, the cherry, you know what the

43:48.380 --> 43:57.980
cherry is. I hinted at it earlier. We have weird Al in my house. We have weird Al's museum of modern

43:57.980 --> 44:04.300
hilarity. And my first game of it, I get over 3 million and it doesn't put me on the board.

44:04.380 --> 44:09.100
I beat Dan. And then since then I haven't been able to top 1 million. It's like, what is it game?

44:09.100 --> 44:14.540
Why are you mean to me? But it's tons and tons and tons. I have beginner's luck on tables,

44:14.540 --> 44:18.380
like where I have a really good run the first, just ask Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, on the tables

44:18.380 --> 44:22.780
in his basement. I had such a, and I can, I can't duplicate it after that first run. It's wild.

44:23.660 --> 44:27.580
It's it's crazy though. Cause the, the table, cause it's one of those P three tables, which

44:27.580 --> 44:36.460
are the modular ones. It's tall. Like I have to get, you know, those aerobic steps that you do,

44:36.460 --> 44:41.180
like step up and they're stackable. I have one of those now so that I am the right height to

44:41.180 --> 44:51.740
play weird Al. It is that much taller than me and well, taller than my capacity to play it.

44:51.740 --> 44:59.740
And it's just, I mean, but it's so much fun and there's so many little things in there

44:59.740 --> 45:04.140
and I'm learning new things in the game. And I found the supply closet and, and

45:06.140 --> 45:12.300
Harvey, the wonder hamster is my nemesis. Cause like I always play worse when I'm trying to hit

45:12.300 --> 45:20.940
the target for Harvey and yeah. All right. It's great. All right. Well, let's move on

45:21.020 --> 45:25.740
for Loki and his gaming week. It's been mostly editing,

45:25.740 --> 45:31.500
actually editing video, but Minecraft. Yeah. We did the world tour today. And of course,

45:33.340 --> 45:40.380
lots of editing still. And I did play one other game though, because we were doing kind of just

45:40.380 --> 45:48.540
in our discord and stuff hanging out. And so we popped in a Jack box and I played a little bit of

45:48.540 --> 45:57.100
trivia murder party too. I almost won. I was this close, this close, but that was fun. And also I

45:57.100 --> 46:02.860
was spectating the t-shirt dojo one or something like that. I don't remember what it's called,

46:02.860 --> 46:06.060
but I think there's a new Jack box game coming out pretty soon here. So

46:06.940 --> 46:10.940
cranking out one of those every year, but for good reason, they're always a lot of fun. They're very

46:10.940 --> 46:17.420
successful party games. So yeah, they're very fun. Okay. My gaming week. So I pretty much talked

46:17.420 --> 46:21.020
already about Southern fried gaming expo, which is, I played a variety of games. They're really

46:21.020 --> 46:25.180
too many for me to go back in name, but what I can't, I will say though, since I see you all

46:25.180 --> 46:29.420
talking about the money games and music games and chat, I did leave this part out on accident,

46:29.420 --> 46:35.420
but there was the whole back of the room was lined up with music machines and they were busy

46:35.420 --> 46:39.660
all the time. Like I, I didn't really want to like wait around a long time. And I was like,

46:39.660 --> 46:43.980
Oh, I'll get on there when nobody's on it at California extreme. That's how it is at

46:43.980 --> 46:49.900
California. Oh yeah. Oh, I'm sure busy the entire time. And I, I didn't really want to

46:49.900 --> 46:54.540
embarrass myself with my skill on those anyway, but it was fun, but they didn't have a 2DX machine.

46:54.540 --> 46:57.260
Unfortunately, that was the one I would have played if they had, but they had like pop them

46:57.260 --> 47:01.660
because they had all the others. They had the one that looks like keyboard mania, the newer one.

47:01.660 --> 47:04.540
And I was like, Ooh, I want to play that, but it was, it was crowded the entire time.

47:05.100 --> 47:12.300
Um, so yeah, they, you know, good times, but, um, after Southern fried,

47:12.300 --> 47:17.900
I stayed one more night at black Wolf Manor because, um, I was flying home the next day

47:18.460 --> 47:22.780
and thank you in nostalgia. That was the game. Thanks. Start to Tia. That was, that was the game.

47:22.780 --> 47:27.180
Um, because I was flying home the next day, I was staying the night at black Wolf Manor and

47:27.180 --> 47:33.340
he has PlayStation VR too, which we've talked a lot about on this show, but I have yet to try it.

47:33.340 --> 47:40.220
So he actually had me try it out. And I actually, uh, I played a little bit of the horizon, uh,

47:40.220 --> 47:46.140
game that's on the PSVR and he first put it into a mode that was very interesting. It was like an

47:46.140 --> 47:51.020
on rails kind of mode where it was really just an experience. It honest to God felt like I was on

47:51.020 --> 47:56.780
jungle cruise without the puns. Um, well, that's the best part. That is the best part, but this,

47:56.780 --> 47:59.980
you know, this had a jump scare at the end and all this stuff. And it was,

48:00.540 --> 48:06.620
it was neat. Um, you know, just like how well it responded to you and some of like the haptic,

48:06.620 --> 48:11.660
you know, stuff that was going on. It was, um, it was cool. Like I, I get why, you know, it's,

48:11.660 --> 48:18.060
it's a better piece of technology than the first VR. I just wish the must have game was on there.

48:18.060 --> 48:22.380
Cause I did, I did futs around with like, there's like a special gaming mode and it was kind of

48:22.380 --> 48:26.460
interesting. Like you'd have to do the whole, like reaching behind you to grab an arrow and

48:26.460 --> 48:30.300
like shoot an arrow like that. And it was, it was kind of neat. Like I actually got kind of

48:30.300 --> 48:36.940
a workout playing it, but like, you know, again, it kind of suffered from that Nintendo Wii mini

48:36.940 --> 48:42.460
game collection syndrome, um, type of thing. And I understand I was only seeing certain modes or

48:42.460 --> 48:48.460
whatever, but I still, I still don't see myself paying the amount of money that it takes to get

48:48.460 --> 48:56.780
PlayStation VR two and this just to have this game. I, I don't really see that happening. Um,

48:56.780 --> 49:02.220
and again, you know, a lot of the things that are on the PlayStation VR two, uh, are kind of a lot

49:02.220 --> 49:08.540
of rehashes of what was on VR one. So I, again, I'm not sure that, yeah. And Bobby even agrees

49:08.540 --> 49:12.220
with me that the software isn't there to justify it yet. And that's the thing I worry about for

49:12.220 --> 49:19.340
the PlayStation VR two, but I will say the tech is great. So I hope, you know, I hope maybe next

49:19.340 --> 49:24.140
year they can get some big titles to really justify the purchase of the VR two. Cause I'd

49:24.140 --> 49:32.060
love to get one. What I loved most about it in this mode I was playing. I did not have to stand

49:32.060 --> 49:38.220
up and move around. It lets you play just sitting there on the couch or in, you know, black Wolf

49:38.300 --> 49:45.660
Manor. It's like, you know, movie sofa type of things. Um, I could sit on that and play the game

49:45.660 --> 49:51.660
and have a good experience without the massive amounts of movement that older VR kind of usually

49:51.660 --> 49:57.980
goes for. And I think that's a good thing for VR as well is that sometimes you just, sometimes you

49:57.980 --> 50:04.380
just want to VR and chill, meaning sit down and play. And yeah, everything I did in the, um,

50:04.380 --> 50:10.460
horizon game that I played was sitting down. Um, yeah, black will says they prefer you to stand

50:10.460 --> 50:14.460
up and play, but they give a seated option. Good. Cause I liked the seated option and I don't feel

50:14.460 --> 50:19.020
like it took anything away from the experience to be honest. So that was that. Oh yeah. Bobby

50:19.020 --> 50:24.620
brings up the eye tracking that that feature was a little weird to me, but it didn't do anything

50:24.620 --> 50:31.020
where I was like, this is too weird for me. Like it was just, it was interesting to like,

50:31.020 --> 50:35.660
look at things and have it like highlight that because you're looking at it with your eyes.

50:35.660 --> 50:41.740
That was just very interesting. So, uh, yeah, that was my quick experience with the PlayStation VR

50:41.740 --> 50:47.100
too. Uh, Y Y R says PS VR two is the new Vita. I was hoping it wouldn't be, but it's clear to me

50:47.100 --> 50:51.660
now that Sony decided to pre-launch to basically not support it, to leave it to third parties and

50:51.660 --> 50:57.340
then forget about it. Sadly, I worry you are probably right on that, but I would, Hey, Sony

50:57.340 --> 51:05.500
proved me wrong. I dare you. Let's all call Sony out this week. Shut this down, support your system.

51:05.500 --> 51:11.660
All right. Anyway. Um, and then I've been playing of course, lots of Diablo four. Cause I feel like

51:11.660 --> 51:15.740
I'm the only person I know that still plays that game, but I'm enjoying season one. Uh, and it's

51:15.740 --> 51:21.980
great to just do some mindless clicking, uh, in that game and enjoy that. And a little bit of final

51:21.980 --> 51:28.300
fantasy 14, the only new game I played this week, which actually it's been out a little bit, but I

51:28.300 --> 51:37.020
finally got around to playing tunic. And I did a stream even on, um, Wednesday, Tuesday. I don't

51:37.020 --> 51:42.380
remember, but I played tunic. Uh, and that game is very interesting. I get the comparisons to the old

51:42.380 --> 51:48.460
school legend of Zelda. It's very that, and very like how you find items to allow you to access

51:48.460 --> 51:53.100
new parts of the map, like that very type of traditional setup where it sort of turns the

51:53.100 --> 51:59.820
formula on its head that I think is very clever is the whole collecting pieces of the instruction

51:59.820 --> 52:05.260
manual. So when you're out in the wild, you will see these sparkling cards. And when you pick it

52:05.260 --> 52:09.740
up, you realize, Oh, this is a missing page from the instruction manual, but the instruction manual

52:09.740 --> 52:15.740
might actually unveil something where it's like, Oh, if I knew this the whole time, this would have

52:15.740 --> 52:19.980
been easier, or I could have gotten through this part because it was in the instruction manual.

52:19.980 --> 52:25.420
And it tells you how to do certain things in the game visually that because the end game stuff is

52:25.420 --> 52:30.940
all in a made up symbol language that, you know, you can't understand, but that's by design so

52:30.940 --> 52:35.340
that the manual helps explain those things to you. So you know how to unlock it. So I thought

52:35.340 --> 52:40.300
that was a very clever twist. And I thought the map design is really clever too, because again,

52:40.300 --> 52:44.380
you'll go all the way through this area and find, Oh, finally, I was able to access this area and

52:44.380 --> 52:49.260
go around and then you'll find there was a secret passage the entire time from the area you could

52:49.260 --> 52:54.860
already access. So this game is almost certainly a speedrunner's dream. Because once you learn about

52:54.860 --> 53:00.620
all those things, I'm sure you can be I'm sure you can bang this game out in minutes, if not a

53:00.620 --> 53:06.220
couple hours. So yeah, I'm excited to explore that game a little more. It was it was a fun experience.

53:06.220 --> 53:13.820
And again, it's it's a familiar formula, but really, really flipped up on its head a little

53:13.820 --> 53:21.020
bit. So I thought that was really fun. SSJ100Matt says Mike Deft wore everyone down and for those

53:21.020 --> 53:26.620
who don't get the joke, Deft has been saying for a long time now we need to play tunic. I mean,

53:26.620 --> 53:30.860
it helped you know, you always want to get the vouch from your friends that a game is

53:31.580 --> 53:37.580
particularly good. Oh, wow. Bobby says the speedrun world record is 17 minutes,

53:37.580 --> 53:43.020
25 seconds. I'm kind of not surprised to hear that. There's got to be a secret passage system

53:43.020 --> 53:49.900
that takes you right to the last boss or something. It's wild. But um, yeah, I genuinely

53:49.900 --> 53:54.540
enjoy tuning. I mean, it was on my radar just from the preview trailers. But you know, there's

53:54.540 --> 53:59.660
lots of games I'd like to play. And I always get sucked into the same old ones Diablo dead by

53:59.660 --> 54:04.620
daylight, Final Fantasy 14, you name it. I tend to stick to the same ones, but I'm glad I branched

54:04.620 --> 54:13.580
out and made myself play tunic and I will do it again. In this coming week or so forth. YYR says

54:13.580 --> 54:19.340
that's faster than the original Legend of Zelda Oh, interesting. Wow. I guess it's not surprising.

54:20.540 --> 54:25.980
All right, that was my gaming week. Let's get into some other news that has happened this week.

54:25.980 --> 54:30.300
So we'll go around and start with Loki. Apparently there's rumors. I mean,

54:30.300 --> 54:35.580
there's always rumors that they're going to do a PlayStation slim of some sort. But

54:35.580 --> 54:45.660
now there's rumors and a video allegedly showing what appears to be a slimmer PlayStation five case.

54:47.820 --> 54:55.340
Okay, we'll see if it comes out. I don't believe anything I see in the internet nowadays.

54:55.340 --> 54:59.820
So it would be I don't know, it would be interesting if they get that out in time for the

54:59.820 --> 55:06.460
holidays. Yeah, that's what the timing is on that, especially when, you know, something not on our

55:06.460 --> 55:12.380
list tonight, but was definitely in the news while we were gone was this whole, you know, did Final

55:12.380 --> 55:19.260
Fantasy 16 sell enough copies or not. And I feel like there's a lot that analysts and internet

55:19.260 --> 55:25.580
critics are kind of reading into it a little bit. But even square has commented that, you know,

55:25.580 --> 55:30.780
essentially being exclusive on one platform has held the sales back, which I think have a lot of

55:30.780 --> 55:36.780
people going. This is why you should release on PC is that you're you only get congrats you played

55:36.780 --> 55:42.620
yourself. You made that deal with Sony you made the bed lie in it. But I don't know at the same

55:42.620 --> 55:46.940
time. I don't think it means that the game is not successful. But yeah, this is the same company

55:46.940 --> 55:51.580
that you know, was disappointed in the sales of Tomb Raider when it sold like 3 million copies.

55:52.060 --> 55:56.060
Oh, it failed. How much of that is actual disappointment? And how much of that are

55:56.060 --> 56:00.380
internet people blowing things up out of proportion for clickbait headlines, especially now

56:00.380 --> 56:04.460
that one of the most major social media websites out there literally pays you to make shit up to

56:04.460 --> 56:10.780
get more impressions. Which is why everyone should be reducing their presence on their site. But I

56:10.780 --> 56:17.020
digress. I'll take my soapbox and go home. Um, but here's, here's, here's the thing is that the

56:17.020 --> 56:21.100
reason what they were blaming for all that was that there was not enough PlayStation fives out

56:21.100 --> 56:25.660
there because we all know for years, they struggled to have enough play. It's only really

56:25.660 --> 56:30.300
this year that you can finally walk into Target and buy a PlayStation five. It took them a long

56:30.300 --> 56:36.460
time to get there. And so there is kind of that being pointed at as a problem for why Final Fantasy

56:36.460 --> 56:41.020
16 and sells many copies. So it is interesting. Now we're talking about a slim because maybe this

56:41.020 --> 56:47.260
is to try to push even more out there even at a lower price to move more exclusive games.

56:47.260 --> 56:49.180
I gotta be honest. So looking at that, like,

56:50.620 --> 56:57.020
I can't see that. I mean, I guess it's slimmer. It still looks really ugly. And it's not that

56:57.020 --> 57:04.140
much. It's still pretty big. Like, no, I don't want it.

57:05.980 --> 57:10.460
Breakman in chat says it seems a bit late in the year to announce new hardware,

57:10.460 --> 57:15.180
even if it's just a remodel. Breakman, it does feel that way. So I acknowledge that it does

57:15.180 --> 57:20.460
feel that way because the death of E3 has changed everything. And there's a couple other things that

57:20.460 --> 57:26.540
play into this as well. But remember, you used to hear about these things in June. E3 is dead.

57:26.700 --> 57:35.260
E3 is dead. She gone, girl. It's dead. It's not coming back. So well, if in the form you will,

57:35.260 --> 57:39.260
because it already was not in the form that you remember from the past. But I don't want to have

57:39.260 --> 57:43.980
to eat my words with catch up later on because they will take that branding and slap it on

57:43.980 --> 57:49.820
something else. Just you wait. But the E3 you remember is dead. Okay. So that whole sense of

57:49.820 --> 57:56.060
announcing things in June for the holiday season that died with E3. Yes, there is Summer Game Fest,

57:56.060 --> 58:00.620
and there are still some announcements, but then other things have changed the game too.

58:00.620 --> 58:05.580
Nintendo Switch being one of them. Don't forget how much lead time did we have on the Nintendo

58:05.580 --> 58:10.700
Switch? We had years of rumors, but when they finally did announce the Nintendo Switch,

58:10.700 --> 58:18.620
we had two months. Two months of warning. So they announced that in January for a March release.

58:18.620 --> 58:23.500
So the games changed when it comes to these timetables. And as was said by somebody else

58:23.500 --> 58:28.620
later in chat, YYR says, well, what if they announced it in September for the holiday season?

58:29.740 --> 58:36.140
They sure could. They could do it. It's still like, I just don't see the point,

58:36.140 --> 58:40.460
like, unless it's going to be cheaper or something, which I don't think it would be. It's just, you

58:40.460 --> 58:46.860
know, smaller, slightly. Yeah. I mean, cool. I mean, if it means there's more consoles out there,

58:47.740 --> 58:52.620
nice. I don't think it's a shortage right now, but yeah, I don't know.

58:52.620 --> 58:57.260
Orange right in chat says, I was about to say the Switch didn't need an E3 reveal. Good point. Well,

58:57.260 --> 59:01.740
don't forget Nintendo was the first one to put the knife into E3 when they took their directs

59:01.740 --> 59:06.540
online. I mean, whether you want to be that dramatic in your phrasing or not, that was the

59:06.540 --> 59:11.740
first piece of the wall to crumble. And you couple that with the embarrassment that Sony made out of

59:11.740 --> 59:18.540
themselves with the unveiling of the PlayStation 3. Microsoft did it too, but they didn't do that

59:18.540 --> 59:23.980
at E3. That was their own conference. They did it at. I like that recently that video came out

59:23.980 --> 59:29.260
remastered in 1080p so that you can watch it in higher definition. I thought that was great.

59:30.620 --> 59:34.220
Breakman in chat says, so what I'm hearing from Sky is that I am old. Hey,

59:34.220 --> 59:40.860
you and me both, bro. You and me both. If I'm going to get reminded about my age by you all,

59:40.860 --> 59:46.860
I'm dragging you all with me every week. Quest Buster with a very marginalized approach on this

59:46.860 --> 59:53.020
that kind of finds the good balance between both saying Gamescom is also coming up. Fair point.

59:53.660 --> 59:57.820
Sony could unveil it at Gamescom. They could. I don't know how much stock I'd put in that,

59:57.820 --> 01:00:02.700
but they could. They could have that out on the show floor as their way to kind of debut it.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:08.780
I don't think that it's not. Oh, your favorite. It's plausible Quest Buster. That is a plausible

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:13.020
answer that that could happen. I'll use your favorite word. You meaning the listeners.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:19.500
All right, but we'll see. Have we heard if this is completely a diskless thing? I thought I saw

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.340
that as well. It looks like it's got a disk on it. That's the thing. That's what I don't understand.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:33.100
I mean, I get it. I don't know. I was really bent out of shape about not having a disk drive

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:38.060
originally, but then I look at what I buy my games on now. It's all digital, so it's fine.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:45.100
I think that's more OK on PC. I don't trust it as much on consoles because, you know,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.580
you have it where it's like, oh, you can't transfer your games over to the new console

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.460
all the time, which makes sense to some degree. But it does suck, especially when you have like

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:59.500
a library of several hundred games or, you know, something like that. It's like, am I expected

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:05.820
just to keep this old console around? I guess. But, yeah, I would think if they're trying to

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:13.020
get it as small of a form factor as possible, as cheap of a price, you would think that they

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.940
would want to do like a slim driveless model. But nope. Allegedly, I mean, at least this

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:25.180
video is of a thing with a disk drive, which looks stupid. Like, I don't like how it's got

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:30.700
this like bulge out the side. It's pregnant with a disk drive. It's just really stupid looking.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.220
But I mean, the original system was like that, too. It's just.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:39.660
All right. I don't know. Make it boxy. It's fine. Doesn't have to be sexy, smooth

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:45.740
in in like curvy and stuff, because that doesn't work if I'm putting in an entertainment center,

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:50.060
like it needs to be boxy so I can stack things on top of it or just.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.900
Real systems have curves, Loki.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:59.180
PCs don't have curves. PCs are boxes for the most part. So come on.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:05.900
Anyway. All right. Let's move on and talk about speaking of PC and consoles and other places.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:12.300
One of the big game developers, Devolver Digital, had a conference this week,

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.380
but this was interesting. They called it the Devolver Delayed Showcase.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:23.980
Because all they announced in this was that Angerfoot, Pepper Grinder,

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:31.660
the Plucky Squire, Stick It to the Stick Man and Skate Story have all moved to 2024.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:36.860
So it was a three minute video called Devolver Delayed where they just made the announcements.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.460
All of these games have shifted to 2024. Please look forward to it.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.740
And that kind of cracked me up a little bit, to be honest. I will say that Plucky Squire is the

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:50.060
one that sticks out to me from that bunch. If I remember, that's the one that looks like the

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.700
storybook. It's a very interesting kind of looking little game. That's one of those games that I

01:02:54.700 --> 01:03:00.140
won't play for two years until Mike Deft is like screaming at me every week to go play it. Go play

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:05.180
the Plucky Squire and then I'll do a stream of it. But that game does look interesting. And at

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:12.300
least I have another year before it's out because it got delayed until 2024. All right. Moving on.

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:22.700
Dark Sakura. Well, we've known for a while that there's been a lot of control by the Chinese

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:29.180
government to try to limit how people play games and what kinds of games they play and how often

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:38.060
they play it. And so there was actually results of their policy of implementing the curfew for

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:42.940
the individuals under the age of 18. It said it had no impact on heavy gaming habits.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:51.980
They basically, the time limit was enacted in November 2019 with a restriction of 90 minutes

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:58.300
per day or three hours on public holidays. And then they were limited further August 2021,

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:03.900
limiting playtime to one hour on specific days, namely Fridays, weekends and holidays.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:11.420
It was trying to combat gaming addiction. And other governments have been paying attention

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:18.700
to it, watching it as studies. So there was a team of researchers that was led by David Zendal at the

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:24.780
University of York. They analyzed over 7 billion hours of gameplay over an 11 week period starting

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:31.260
from November 2019. They focused on 118 million unique gamer profiles in China linked to Unity.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:40.300
And the analysis showed that it really had no effect. In fact, they were 1.14 times more

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:45.900
likely to engage in heavy gaming, playing for over four hours a day, six days a week after the policy

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:53.740
was implemented. They noticed that, I mean, the increase isn't like that, you know, meaningful

01:04:53.740 --> 01:05:06.620
really. But yeah. This is what happens when you try to force something on people, they're still

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:12.860
going to find a way to do something. And really, it begins with, you know, maybe not having a

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:18.780
really bad totalitarian style government, I guess. Well, I was going to read this comment from

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:22.620
Brakeman in our chat that says, you know what the most effective thing against children gaming too

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:35.340
much? Their parents. Well, even so, I would say, like, I'm going to use myself as an example.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:44.620
If I'm in a situation that I'm unhappy, I'm going to look for distraction more readily. If I'm happy

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:50.940
and having meaningful things going on in my life, I will probably be out doing said meaningful

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.420
things. I mean, I'm not saying that gaming doesn't have any meaning or anything like that,

01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:01.900
but I'm saying that there's clearly something else going on that makes the games a little

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.300
bit more addictive, that makes them more attractive than other things in their life.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:15.100
So I would say, you know, you can't put everything 100% on a parent if you have a

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:21.260
willful child. I say this as a former willful child. I would agree with that. I was very good

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:25.660
at hiding how many video games I was playing for my parents, especially once the Game Boy came out.

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:29.180
Your parents cannot stop that without taking the whole thing away,

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:37.580
which is always going to start a fight. So at any rate, what they need to do

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:45.180
is go back and look at the base problem. It's like in technical troubleshooting,

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:50.300
you have to find the root cause. And what is the root cause of gaming addiction? Well,

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:56.940
it's not just the game. I mean, yeah, the game's a big part of it, but there's also something that

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:05.900
leads someone to do nothing but to get that dopamine release, I guess, when they're playing

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:12.380
a game and they hit that reward, you know, why aren't they getting that from other things?

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:17.580
What makes the difference here or there? And I think it's really a matter of looking at

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:26.540
this from a psychological point of view, a cultural point of view, a societal point of view,

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:31.260
rather than just say, oh, just restrict them. That'll do it. No, it won't. An addict will find

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:35.180
a way to feed their addiction. All right.

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:40.940
Well, let's move on to another story. It looks like someone hit pause on your avatar. I don't

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:50.860
know if the program just. But anyway, Loki, OK. You know, it's funny to see Roblox out

01:07:50.860 --> 01:08:00.540
metaverse in the metaverse, but, you know, we have a story about Roblox allowing folks to actually

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:09.980
apply and kind of interview for jobs in Roblox. So Roblox Corporation themselves are actually

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:18.380
having areas in their own platform where you can actually get an idea of what it would be like to

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:24.300
have a career at Roblox. They have an innovation center where candidates can come in and see what

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:29.020
they have planned. They have a podcast lounge we could listen to. Apparently they have a podcast. I

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:37.500
mean, everybody has a podcast, I guess, by their CEO. And they have a library with curated selection

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:43.420
of books and other reading materials. People who are really going to read books in Roblox,

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:50.220
I just don't see that happening. But yeah, they said the Roblox, the Career Center will let the

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:56.220
company reach early career candidates across the world. How early are we talking here, children?

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:02.860
Um, wait, I don't know. Can we play orange on radio in Roblox? Why aren't we jumping if we if

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:09.580
you could do podcasts in Roblox? Where's the OLR? You probably could I think maybe we can make home

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:17.500
my son's at the same time. Kids shouldn't listen to this show. So if Roblox is mostly kids, then

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:23.820
maybe it's well, that's where that's where the mature rated content in Roblox, which is a recent

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:31.740
edition comes into play. So technically, it is Roblox material at this point. Gotcha. But yeah,

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:36.060
my son's actually doing Roblox programming now, because he's gotten to that level in his

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:43.740
programming class to where he is doing Lua. So it's strictly for Roblox stuff. But yeah,

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.780
there's a place you should put PlayStation home in Roblox. There you go.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.940
All right, I have to giggle a little bit, too, because I think I think dark soccer stepped away

01:09:52.940 --> 01:10:00.060
for a minute. But her avatar looks like like it frozen is really funny. But I guess when it

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.220
stopped, like camera tracking, as she was getting up and leaving, it just looks like it looks like

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:10.460
she's tilted her head back and passed out in her chair. Like Loki's Loki's Roblox story was so

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:17.420
fucking boring. It put the vtubers to sleep. I mean, it isn't exactly super interesting.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:31.260
I don't know why the image is so funny to me. All right. Anyhow, let's talk about other things that

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:39.260
have been around a while. Let's talk about Pokemon presents. So Pokemon had a very special recap or

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:44.060
direct whatever you want to call it this week. It was the Pokemon presents August 2023 showcase

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:51.100
where they had 35 minutes of updates on different projects, including DLC for Scarlet and Violet,

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:58.620
the hidden treasure of areas, area zero, area zero. Also, there was an update on the Pokemon

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:04.460
World Championships, which I think was going on this weekend in Yokohama, which means competitions

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:10.940
for Scarlet Violet, the trading card game Unite Go even has a competition there because Pokemon Go

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:14.620
has a whole tie-in thing going on right now in that game. So they were talking a little bit

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:21.260
about that. They were talking about an animated mini web series called Pokemon Path to the Peak.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:26.940
This is about the trading card game. And in this little cartoon, we got to meet the protagonist and

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:33.100
you know, the oddish partner Pokemon. It will be on YouTube now. Actually, it came out on the 11th

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:38.940
of August. So it's available now. Then we got into some of the good stuff for gaming. A new trailer

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:44.700
for Detective Pikachu Returns. Sorry, Danny DeVito is still not the voice of Detective

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:49.580
Pikachu, but the game does look fun for those that are curious about that. There was also a teaser

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:59.580
for Pokemon Horizons, the series. This is the show post Ash Ketchum and all that. The kickoff date

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:05.820
will be September 8th in North America is when that series will be launching for us here. They

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:12.380
did some updates for Pokemon Go. They were begging people to buy tickets for Pokemon Go Fest Global

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:17.260
on the 26th and 27th of August, even if you're not going to the New York City one in person.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:23.180
They also are saying that DNC, I don't know how to say this Pokemon's name, sorry,

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:29.100
is making the Pokemon Go debut and it will have a mega evolution as well. And Mega Rayquaza is also

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:36.620
coming to the game. Whoopee! But the big announcement for Pokemon Go, the new Pokemon from

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:43.340
Gen 9, starter Pokemon, will be making their Go debut in September. What's kind of interesting

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:52.300
about this news is that Gen 8's not finished. It's far from finished. The starters for Gen 8

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:56.300
are not in the game. They're going to put the starters for Gen 9 in the game before they do

01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:00.780
the starters for Gen 8, which I think is interesting. I don't know. Just to be different.

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:05.740
They have some, like Wooloo is in the game of some other Gen 8 Pokemon, but they, for whatever

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:10.540
reason, are skipping it otherwise. I don't know if this is just Go being different. It probably,

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:16.700
honestly, it's probably just to tie into the fact that there is Scarlet and Violet DLC coming out.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:21.980
And so they want to do a tie into that and push those games back to the front with the holiday

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:27.100
season around the corner. There's a lot of people that, you know, Pokemon Go is their primary

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:35.020
Pokemon game. So I think it has to do more with all that than everything else. Pokemon Unite is

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:41.340
getting a new game mode called Panic Parade. With this mode, you work with your teammates to protect

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:47.820
a certain Pokemon from oncoming enemies. Also, Mewtwo License X is now in the game and Mewtwo

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:54.380
License X can evolve into Mega Mewtwo X. And then guess what's coming on 17th of August? Mewtwo

01:13:54.380 --> 01:14:02.780
License Y, of course. And then in Pokemon Master Sex, which actually the game is called Pokemon

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:09.420
Masters EX, but it's impossible to read this and not see Pokemon Master Sex. I mean it. That's

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:14.300
just the order of the letters. Yeah. Pokemon Master Sex will be seeing

01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:20.380
Nimona from Scarlet and Violet and Pomat are coming to the game. It is a new sync pair in

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:27.820
the game with the sprint roll that allows them to attack quickly. A Pokemon Cafe remix game is

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:34.380
coming up. And I think probably the news that had a lot of people excited was Pokemon Trading Card

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:41.020
Game and Pokemon Stadium 2 were released on Nintendo Switch Online. Why they won't just put

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:47.660
out the classic Pokemon games is anyone's guess. My guess is they want to sell it separately someday.

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:52.460
But still, the Pokemon Trading Card Game was pretty good as was Stadium 2. A lot of people

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:56.300
do like those games. So you can check those out with the NSO. Of course, you'll need the

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:04.300
expansion pack for Pokemon Stadium 2, but that is something that will be coming soon. And then last,

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:09.020
we'll mention the Mewtwo Terra Raid battle in Scarlet and Violet. That is going to be happening

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:15.100
from September 1st through September 17th. And then they showed a little bit of a deep dive on

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:22.140
the DLC that's also coming out with the hidden treasures of area zero, which feature the teal

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:29.900
mask and the indigo disc. That's part one and part two. It's one DLC in two parts. So there you go.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:36.140
Lots of Pokemon news, although most people saying the presents overall was kind of lackluster.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:41.900
My guess is it's because the focus was a little less on the games and there was a lot of stuff

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.620
on the anime. I think a lot of Pokemon fans don't care for GO, quite frankly.

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:56.060
There's a lot of stuff that doesn't really relate to the games. I think people set the bar too high

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:59.820
in expecting that they were going to announce a remake or something. It's not time for that yet.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.860
You got to wait for next year for news on whatever they're going to do. If they're remaking Gen 5 or

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.020
whatever they're doing, there's a lot of rumors going around with that. One rumor was that instead

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:15.020
of doing a remake of Gen 5, they're going to do like a basically a sequel, which is funny because

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:19.260
there already is a black to white too. So I don't know, but this is something I guess they're

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:23.580
looking at maybe black three. I don't know something that may be like a spiritual successor

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:29.340
or something. Who knows? So Mike Defton chat says for me, it was fine. I really didn't expect

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:35.660
anything really mind blowing. Tigerclaw in chat says, good thing they separated the EX from

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:42.060
Pokemon masters EX. That little space bar is not going to stop the internet from saying Pokemon

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:48.220
master sex. Once it's there, it's there. It's once on the internet, always on the internet.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.260
All right. Speaking of things that are now always on the internet, Dark Sakura.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:59.100
Hey, I'm not always on the internet. Not always, but even when you step

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.660
away from your keyboard, your avatar is still here on the internet.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.580
Apparently she does very wonky things when I'm not here.

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:12.220
Yeah. I know about that. I know about that. It's just, uh, the cousins came over and there's a

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:16.700
spaghetti with the spasm meatball. Oh no, you don't, you don't have to explain it. It's just

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.060
funny that when you stepped away, your Pokemon was like, or your Pokemon.

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:35.180
I know Jamie Mon go, use pester ball. It's super effective.com. Anyway. So, um, there is a comic

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.500
series that I was actually super excited about when it came out and that was, uh, Teenage Mutant

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:48.220
Ninja Turtles, The Last Ronin. And it was pretty, uh, pretty heartbreaking. The concept behind it,

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:55.100
where you're one of the turtles and the other three are dead. And so you're carrying their,

01:17:55.100 --> 01:18:01.100
their, your, their weapons with you. And you're trying to seek some vengeance, um, to get, you

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:08.140
know, justice for their murder. Um, and it's really dark. It's really dark, but it still has some of

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:15.820
the, some of the same heart, you know, packaged in it. But at any rate, there is a teaser put up

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:22.540
and, uh, that's for, uh, uh, a game, uh, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Last Ronin, the game.

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:27.580
Um, the, the trailer is just some pretty kind of generic stuff. Um,

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:36.540
Strong Bad Game. Sorry. I got distracted. Thanks. It's Loki. No, you're not. It's okay.

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:46.540
It's dangerous. So that's fine. Um, but anyway, uh, there's no real details on it. There's not a

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:53.660
release date, not a window for it, but the trailer is really pretty. And if they do it right, this is

01:18:53.660 --> 01:19:01.980
going to be a really good dark story. It has a very unique art style that is very much not the

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:06.460
nineties iteration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that most of us associate with Ninja Turtles.

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:13.180
Let's be real. It's, it's honestly, uh, quite a bit, uh, like the comic, it looks a lot like

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:23.740
how the comic looked. Um, and I mean, the comics are, are they've been like the very original ones

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:31.980
were quite dark. They were quite dark and, uh, and, you know, really, really just the stories

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:39.260
were definitely geared a little bit more adult, you know, so at any rate, at any rate, it's,

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:46.700
it's, um, I'm hoping that the, that the game, uh, matches the, the comics in quality.

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.860
Well, some folks in our chat room are already pretty impressed with where it's headed. Quest

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:58.220
Buster saying the last Ronan is so good. I hope the game turns out well, uh, tiger claw pointing

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:02.220
out, they're continuing the comics. They released new comics. That's a prequel and a sequel,

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:08.780
and it introduces a new generation of Ninja Turtles. Yeah. Now I don't know. The one thing

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:17.660
that, um, I was keeping up with the IDW, um, series, you know, just the, the ongoing one.

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:26.780
And it was just going from how those have been to this. I definitely am seeing it as sort of like

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:33.500
an alternate future sort of thing from that continuity, but still it's, it's, it's really

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:38.140
good and pretty dark. So, and I'm not going to spoil who the surviving turtle is for those who

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:44.940
don't know. Okay. All right. Well, let's move on and let's see if, uh, this, the market can survive

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:50.140
the rerelease of this game Loki, cause this is an interesting story. Not even a rerelease. It's

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:55.740
a port, which is even worse. Uh, I mean, I guess it's technically you're releasing again, but on

01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:03.260
another system. So, um, this stinks of the grand theft auto San Andreas definitive edition, but

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:09.420
it's not, it's basically a port of the original red dead redemption, which is coming out now for

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:18.060
the switch and the PlayStation five. Um, why not Xbox? Because there's already a version that is

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:24.620
playable on Xbox and for less money. Uh, this version is going to be $50. What have they done

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:29.900
to the game? Not really much. They haven't really remastered anything on it. Actually,

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:35.980
it's just a straight port plus the undead nightmare DLC, which was like the game of

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:39.420
the year edition that they sold for 20 bucks, but now they're selling for 50.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:45.340
Please don't support this. It's awful. Especially since they didn't port at the PC either. So

01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:54.300
whatever. I mean, I don't know. I just would not support this stuff. Of course, CEO Strauss

01:21:54.300 --> 01:22:00.300
Zelnick thinks it's a great price. It's we, we, we believe it's a commercially accurate price for it.

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:05.580
How about we wait for a deep sale instead, because you know what? There's no rush to play

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:11.580
red dead redemption on any modern console now, because it's been out for a long time.

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:16.620
I'm sure there will still be people that buy this and whatever it's fine, but they shouldn't

01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:21.980
support it at $50 because it's all that, that sends a signal to rockstar games that they can

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.300
just do whatever they want, put it out and people will just eat it up for whatever price they put

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:33.900
it out there. And like, especially like we got burnt by the, um, definitive edition, like

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:39.100
absolutely do not pre-order this and wait for the reviews to come out before you play it. Cause

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:45.100
yeah, the switch isn't a powerful piece of hardware and we're talking about running

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:52.620
red dead redemption on it. I would wait for the reviews. PlayStation five, probably fine.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:59.580
Here's something else with the price and all that stuff. I feel like the industry, like not just,

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:05.900
you know, take two and whoever, like the entire industry needs to remember why did the Wii U fail?

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:11.020
There's a lot of reasons why the Wii U failed, but here's one big reason that we, you failed

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:14.140
is because when you look at the launch software that came out for the Wii U,

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:18.460
the vast majority of it was stuff. And even the things that they were highlighting at E3,

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:23.100
when they announced the Wii U, yes, there were some original things on it. And, you know,

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:27.660
none of it was of the same quality of the launch titles of other systems before it. But I digress.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:32.060
The real issue was there were a lot of these third party games that were coming out,

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:37.180
things like mass effect three, uh, the Batman Arkham games, you know, and all this stuff.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:41.900
There were these games that were coming out that had already been out for a year,

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:47.340
had already been discounted as a result. And now they were trying to put these games out on the

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:53.020
Wii U at the full retail price. And then they were wondering why do people not buy these games?

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:59.340
And I'm reminded too, that this version of red dead redemption doesn't have multiplayer,

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:06.220
which was fun. I used to play the multiplayer of red dead redemption with my coworkers and it was

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:11.820
a, it was a great time. Not part of it. You're, you're getting even less content for more money.

01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:18.140
Zen monkey 11 quite bluntly says, fuck that shit. I won't even buy it on sale.

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:24.380
I, I get it. Uh, as John Hunter, Matt says that same CEO got his salary doubled recently. I'd

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:29.260
like to see how he justifies that. Excellent question. Uh, making billions of dollars on

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:35.580
the stupid app, you know, shark cards is how he does it, which isn't his doing like he just sits

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:40.620
there and collects money. Uh, while we are in chat says PC port probably coming later because that's

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:49.020
what rock star does. Hmm. Well on the PC front and eventually the console front as well. Uh,

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:54.220
we have, uh, this, this game has been everywhere. This is another one of those games. I know we

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:58.780
talked about Palia earlier, but this game is also just taken over Twitch. I have a ton of friends

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:03.580
that have been streaming this game and it's Baldur's gate three. And I got to say this game,

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:07.260
like I never really got into the older Baldur's gate games, which I know were hugely popular at

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:12.540
the time. Um, but the, just watching people play this, it kind of has my attention and I'm like,

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:18.060
Oh, should I be picking this up? I don't know, but the game is not without its own issues.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:26.300
Uh, apparently, uh, some translation folks that worked on the game, uh, namely outsourced workers

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:33.100
were omitted from the games credits, uh, founder and CEO of the Altagram group,

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:37.900
which was the studio that handled these translations said we take full responsibility

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:42.620
for this omission of our freelancers names and apologize for the effects that it had.

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:47.980
We would like to thank Larian, the makers of, um, Baldur's gate three for allowing us to quickly

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:53.180
fix that error and update the credit section. The names of the Brazilian Portuguese translators will

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:58.700
be included in an upcoming patch to the game. Let's let, let us take a moment to remember

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:04.460
Brazil is a very large country, and that's a lot of potential sales. And to do that,

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.260
you need a hardworking translators, you know, localizers as well to work on your game to do

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:14.380
that. So even though for you, me, most people that listen to this show, because we don't speak

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:19.100
Portuguese, it doesn't seem like a big deal to leave these folks out. It's a huge deal to leave

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:24.860
these folks out when an entire country, you know, relies on them essentially and others to not just,

01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:30.380
but that's been the largest one to be able to play this game and make it more accessible. So

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:36.300
that's really unfortunate. I don't know how the fuck that got overlooked. I have a feeling if we

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:41.180
worked in a unionized industry, it would have been a lot harder to overlook, but I, I'm getting on a

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:48.540
different tangent perhaps. Anyway, um, Larian studios did say Altagram was to blame for the

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:52.700
oversight and they asked the company to rectify the situation. And of course, of course they

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:57.820
obliged. They kind of have to do that. Um, but it's worth pointing out. Outsourced workers don't

01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:03.340
always get fully credited for their work. This can sometimes impact future projects. It can be

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:09.500
difficult to prove that you worked on a potential game to a new employer. Um, you know, I know a lot

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.900
of people just skip the credits and don't look at them. I get it. The games that are coming out these

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:19.740
days have very long credit sequences and people tend to skip them, but that's important to the

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:24.060
people that worked on the game because even to have that moment of look, it's my name and the

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:28.060
game, and then to be able to put that on something like your LinkedIn profile or whatever, that's

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:35.100
huge and that's important. So let's just hope that this gets fixed for the future. But of course,

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:40.380
there's another cloud hanging over all of this. They'll probably be developers that are going to

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:46.220
try to get artificial intelligence, which is really machine learning, but automated, we'll say

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:51.580
automated translation services to do that. All I'm going to say with that, you all have used

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:57.340
Google translate. I don't think machine learning is going to be that much better at it. You get

01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:03.740
what you pay for. Period. End of sentence. Do not leave these entire countries out because

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:10.380
you think chat GPT can do the job of a human being when it comes to language, which is how we

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:20.060
express ourselves and share culture. It's so infuriating. Anyway, maybe I have the WGA strike

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:27.020
fresh in my mind and some of the things they're fighting for. Who knows? Anyway, we need to take

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:32.140
a moment to go back to a simpler time. So I think it's time to call in the next segment to save us

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:48.540
here. Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:55.740
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. But once a month,

01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:02.220
Dark Sakura flips the script with a non-video game. So Dark Sakura, what did you pack for us

01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:11.660
tonight? The game is Don't Break the Ice. It is a tabletop game for two to four players,

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:20.620
three ages and up. And it was first marketed by Shapper Toys in 1968, sold to Hasbro as a

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:26.060
subsidy of Milton Bradley in 1986. And it's still in production with very special versions,

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:33.420
including Frozen and Frozen 2. So basically you have these ice blocks and a stand

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:39.660
and a miniature plastic hammer for each player. And one block is bigger than the rest. And there

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:46.380
is a plastic character sitting on it. And some additions, it's Phillip the penguin and a dude

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:53.100
called Iceman or a polar bear. To set it up, basically you turn the stand upside down and

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:58.860
you put all the blocks in so that the, I mean, basically it's using compression to hold all of

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:05.020
the blocks in place, you know. And then you take turns removing blocks by tapping with the hammer.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.140
And when one player causes the block with a character to fall through,

01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:19.180
then the person before that is the winner. So, but I mean, very simple premise for a game,

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:25.740
you know, it, I would imagine that, you know, it's various versions are really just limited

01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:30.300
to anything kind of snow theme, you know. But I mean,

01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:39.740
many different covers it's had, so many different, you know, ways that their little

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:48.940
thing has looked, the brace for it. And you can still, you know, go to, like, I think it's like

01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:57.980
17 bucks through Hasbro, but you can get it practically at any store. And from the Hasbro

01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:06.140
edition box, I'll go ahead and read the little poem it comes with. Tap out ice blocks one by one,

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:11.820
they won't melt when you are done. Take your time and do some thinking to keep the polar bear from

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:16.220
sinking. To win the bear must stay on top. One wrong block, he'll go kerplop.

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:24.940
And a notable thing is that in 2004, this one, the Japan board game prize for best

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:31.260
child game. Actually, I take that back, it was just nominee. But, but that's the game.

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:42.220
Don't break the ice. And I mean, like, even the original box. It was very 60s. But like this,

01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:46.780
this game is just fun. You know, it's good fun. And I like putting things other than the little

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:50.940
dude on top. You know, like putting a Sonic figure up there.

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.820
You know, like putting a Sonic figure up there.

01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.060
Oh, amiibo would be good for the answer. Those might be a little heavy.

01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:02.620
Amiibos will be too heavy. Maybe like a little gotcha pun figure.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:05.420
Yeah, something you get out of a vending machine for a quarter.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:10.860
bonds 006 and chat says my attention span would not want to play this the setup and

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:15.340
downtime is too much. Well, this guy in the YouTube really that long. I know this guy in

01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:20.380
the YouTube videos moving at a glacial pace pun intended. I don't remember the game taking this

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:25.180
long to set up to be quite honest. So I'm sure he's explaining things that we have muted while

01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.940
he's doing this. But yeah, usually you just you get everybody to collect the pieces and you can

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:32.540
set it up pretty quick. Like it's just Yeah, you know, that big block. I mean,

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:39.900
if a bunch of junk queer people can do it. Yeah, and it's not an ASMR video. It's just a review

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:47.900
of the game. But I mean, we did it. We made it work. Phil of nine is in chat. Who is there that

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:54.940
night that infamous night grandpa's so yeah, it was good time. That was also the night that

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:58.860
that I think we decided to buy grandpa's house.

01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:04.380
Except somebody else bought it because he didn't live there.

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:10.620
No, no, this house. Oh, oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was thinking of the house we were at

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:17.340
that night. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I always Yeah, I always I honestly Jamie, I forget that grandpa

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.500
lived there. Which is funny because I don't remember sitting on the back porch. I know

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:26.460
what I named furniture. Now that you say it. I do. But sometimes in my brain, I don't associate

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:32.460
it with being the same house. You know what I mean? Yeah, even though Yes, it is. So it's just

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:40.300
funny. Well, if this is my house, you feel like it. You get the fuck out. Anyway, I it's being

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:44.300
mentioned our chat by Jim Sally since we were talking about you know, if drunk queer people

01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:50.460
can do it. Jim Sally and chat says we high straight people can do it too. Yeah, well,

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:56.940
I'm glad. Where's the where's that meme? Where it's like, you know, the hands shaking where

01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:02.700
that might be the quote unquote opposing views, drunk queer people, high straight people playing

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:07.500
don't break the ice. There you go. You have the little little world peace agreement there. All

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:13.260
right. All right. If the high straight people and the junk gay people teamed up,

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:22.380
the world would be in trouble. Or, or something. All right. Let's move on and talk about some

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:26.860
other headlines at a rapid pace and what we call rapid fire news. Loki.

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:36.540
Yes, the lollipop chainsaw remake is been delayed. Wasn't quite part of the developer digital delay

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:42.700
announcement, but it's its own delay announcement, I guess, coming out next summer now. And then

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:51.980
Netflix just released a app to turn your phone or tablet into a controller for playing their games,

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:57.500
I assume on TV. That sounds horrible. I'd rather have a controller to do that. But

01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:06.300
at least it's an option. I mean, that works for like jackbox. But it's a very particular

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:12.380
type of game that a phone controller will work for. Yeah, but when they're talking about like

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:23.100
Assassin's Creed, no, I would rather not. Same. Same. All right, moving on dark soccer.

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:30.380
So Sega has some announcements for Samba de Amigo Party Central. They put out their roadmap for the

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:36.780
DLC. On August 29th, we will have the Sonic the Hedgehog music pack for five bucks,

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:42.460
as Open Your Heart, Reach for the Stars, and I'm Here. And then the Japanese music pack,

01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:49.260
which is Kaikai Kitan, Matsuken Samba 2, and King, which is a Hatsune Miku one.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:57.420
On September 27th, we have Sega Music Pack, Bakamitai Taxi Driver Edition. We have Go Go

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:03.180
Cheer Girl from Space Channel 5 Part 2, Rhythm Thief Theme from Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:10.300
Treasure, and then a K-Pop pack with details to be announced. So you can still get the Digital

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:15.740
Deluxe Edition that has the standard version of the game, the Sonic the Hedgehog music pack,

01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:22.300
the Sega music pack from September 27th, a Sonic the Hedgehog costume and accessories pack,

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:26.540
a Tails costume and accessories pack, Super Monkey Ball costume and accessories pack,

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:31.820
P.O.P.O. accessories pack, which is what I want, and the Space Channel 5 costume and accessories

01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:37.900
pack. And then there's also the digital upgrade bundle, where you basically just pay extra for

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:45.100
the bonus stuff. It will be out on the Switch on August 29th. Oh wow, that's really soon. I

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:51.500
didn't realize Samba's like around the corner. That's pretty cool. All right. Well, music game

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:56.460
fans, don't say I don't still love you because I have a new music game to talk about here,

01:36:56.460 --> 01:37:04.460
which is, I'm going to butcher the name of this, but it's Toho Danmaku Kagura Fantasia Lost.

01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.300
Toho. Toho. So this is basically

01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:17.500
a rhythm game around the Toho project, and it is coming out for PC on Steam on February 8th.

01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:25.340
So also, and of note to other gaming fans, there will be a collaboration song with Toby Fox from

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:29.340
Undertale, who, you know, of course, created and did the music to that game. He's basically

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.980
the John Carpenter of video games. How many more versions of

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.140
Megalovania can we get? All of them.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:38.460
It sounds like this is actually a new song because he's collaborating with

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:43.980
Zune from Toho Project to actually do this as free DLC. So that's kind of cool.

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:48.380
There are two different rhythm games within this, the Kagura stage, where you hit the notes

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:54.220
at the right moment and you stack up combos and get the high score. And then a Danmaku stage,

01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:57.820
which is what we're seeing on Twitch right now, if you're watching, which is a shoot them up

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:03.580
mixed with a rhythm game. That's kind of neat. I like that. That might be worth checking out

01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:09.100
there. You hit the notes on the sides rhythmically to do damage to the boss, and then you do missions

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:13.500
and do all that good stuff there. So, oh, that's kind of neat.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:17.660
It's like a neat little spin on that. And, uh, you know, from a, from a franchise that a lot

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:22.460
of people know about. So yeah, it looks very pop and music a little bit, a little bit. So remember,

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.460
it's going to be, I believe it's on the switch as well at some point, but right now it's going

01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:30.860
to be on steam. I thought I saw something about a switch release at some point. I mean,

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:35.900
I'll probably get it. Yeah. Uh, I do kind of wonder if I would be able to hook up my

01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:41.500
pop-in controller. Oh, maybe that would be fun. Uh, Chad Leland's in chat. Hey,

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:47.980
Shane say he's also a Pokemon composer now to me, his stuff in Scarlet violet is real good. Yeah.

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:52.860
I mean, they, and it's not just making love. He does new pieces for stuff. He's a very good

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:57.580
composer. Again. It's it's like, he's the John Carpenter of games. Like he directs the movies

01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:03.420
and, you know, obviously that iconic Halloween soundtrack with a piano that John Carpenter wrote

01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:09.820
that. So that's, yeah. I've, I've, I don't know if you've heard me say it, Rob, but when I'm in

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:16.380
chase against a, uh, uh, um, a Meyers, I almost called him Kyle. We call him Kyle. Why do you

01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:22.700
call him Kyle? That's Shayla. Shayla is the one who started it. So now like when we're mad at him

01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:30.780
is like Michael Kyle, Albert Alfonso Meyers, you know, the second. Oh, his legal name. I see. Yeah.

01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:37.580
But, um, but when, uh, whenever the chase music is like go away, John Carpenter, because I took

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:44.060
it from that. There's a parody out there that, you know, John Carpenter's following Michael

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:53.660
around with, with his little keyboard. Yeah. Perfect. All right. Uh, with that,

01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:57.580
let's travel around the world and check out what video games are coming out this week.

01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:02.860
We'll start in the U S with Loki. All right. Yeah. We have quite a few things coming out

01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:09.580
this week, actually. So starting off with Everspace 2 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox series,

01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:16.940
HammerWatch 2 on PC, Moving Out 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:25.740
Xbox One and Xbox series, Unguard on PC, the Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood on PC and Nintendo Switch,

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:35.340
uh, Afogato on PC, uh, Kentucky Route Zero on the TV edition. I don't know what that is exactly.

01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:44.140
That's on a PlayStation 5 and Xbox series, Marble It Up Ultra, which, um, is, you may remember this

01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:50.780
as Marble Blast Ultra. They changed the name. Uh, that is now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:56.220
PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series. That's like one of the first, uh, Xbox live arcade games

01:40:56.220 --> 01:41:03.900
that I had. Um, reminder, don't buy this game, uh, Red Dead Redemption coming out on Nintendo

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:08.700
Switch and PlayStation 4 this, uh, oh, I thought it was PlayStation 5. Oh, okay. Well, that's even

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:16.140
worse. Uh, well, PlayStation 4, um, Shadow Gambit, The Cursed Crew on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox

01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:24.620
series, uh, Shinobi Non Grata on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. And, uh, this is a better use

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:29.340
of your money right here on the Nintendo Switch, Vampire Survivors coming out on Nintendo Switch.

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:37.020
And then, uh, last but not least, we have a few more for Friday, uh, Bomb Rush Cyber Funk on PC

01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:43.100
and Nintendo Switch. Also another title well worth your money versus Red Dead Redemption,

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:51.180
um, Madden NFL 24 on PC, PlayStation 5, uh, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox series,

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:55.820
Radiant Silver Gun. I swear to God, it's like coming out every single week. That's on PC.

01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:01.740
This is like Ikaruga again. Uh, that's true. And last but not least, um,

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:08.380
Texas Chainsaw Massacre on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series.

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:13.180
All right. Well, that's it. That may not be a Halloween video game, but that is a different

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:17.980
Dead by Daylight Killer getting its own game. Uh, and that, that one looked interesting in

01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:22.620
the previous. I don't know if it looked more interesting than DVD to me. It just,

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:28.220
I don't know. I, it looked, it looked like it was a lot more faithful to the, um, movie than I would

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:34.940
have thought. I was very surprised that like, wow, they actually did kind of create a, um,

01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:39.020
what do they call it? Asymmetrical multiplayer game out of the movie. That was pretty surprising.

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:47.100
So, uh, all right. Let's let you know, there was that big, big, there was that big thing though

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:53.180
that got leakers in trouble for saying that they were, they had data mined and that, you know,

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:57.900
uh, Bubba was going to be gone from the game and they use that to catch people.

01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:03.020
Yeah. And, uh, it turns out you can, you can be in Dead by Daylight and still have your own video

01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:08.860
game. So if, uh, the folks from stranger things and Netflix are listening, uh, both those things

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:14.380
are possible as it turns out. So, uh, at this point I would travel to Japan and tell you what's

01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:19.180
coming out this week in Japan, but guess what? Nothing is coming out this week in Japan. I don't

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:25.260
know what, and it's not golden week, so it's not that, but for whatever reason, there's, there's a

01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:29.900
third party converter. Like if you want to use different controllers on your PlayStation five,

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:34.140
like there's a con that that's, that's not really a game, but that's like the only thing that's

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:41.260
coming out, uh, in Japan for whatever reason. So go figure. Um, the break manager says, sorry,

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:47.340
mountain day. Uh, the break manager says, I liked, I liked the Friday, the 13th game. I like the

01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:52.300
original NES one, but I know you're bringing up the asymmetrical multiplayer one that got

01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:56.940
fucked by licensing, but I would, I would argue without that game, we probably wouldn't have the

01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:02.060
success of something like day dead by daylight. It's a bummer that licensing issues and greed

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:06.300
essentially really fucked that Friday, the 13th game, because that was fun. It was different. It

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:11.500
was different experience. Um, I just hope with the closure of that, maybe they'll finally license

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:15.260
Jason for the big game. We want to see him in, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:21.260
So, uh, let's go to Europe until then, until then we can just play trapper.

01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:26.780
Yes, you do have that. And the fact that the Friday, the 13th game, I believe is still running

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:31.740
through the end of the year. Um, uh, yeah, I can't remember the exact day they were closing it,

01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:38.220
but I think you still have a little bit longer. Well, at any rate, um, for what's coming out in,

01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:48.060
uh, the UK and, and Europe on August 15th for switch Xbox PlayStation is moving out to, um,

01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:55.180
on the 17th for PlayStation and Xbox is gored on the 18th for those same two is the Texas

01:44:55.180 --> 01:45:06.780
chainsaw massacre. Um, also Madden NFL 24 and also, um, uh, curse of the stars and that's it.

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:14.940
All right. Sorry. I was typing something in chat and I want my keyboard going through,

01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:20.780
uh, let's touch on a couple other headlines and then we'll get to the mailbag as well as

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:24.540
potentially maybe any calls tonight. We're going to get later on if you want to participate that

01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:29.580
way with our show, head on over to the green room over at vog network.com that's VOG network.com

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:35.020
slash discord to join our discord server. Uh, and we do chat throughout the week in discord as well.

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:41.260
And if you're a subscriber here on Twitch, uh, you actually get access to a special channel as

01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:46.620
well for, and sometimes we post little sneak peaks, such as the videos that we shot on Thursday,

01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:50.220
our subscribers had a heads up there and the subscriber chat. So check that out. You do have

01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:53.740
to have your Twitch link to discord. If you're sitting here going, I don't see that. And I'm

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.260
subbed to the channel. Make sure your Twitch is linked to discord because otherwise it doesn't

01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:01.020
know how to set the settings that way. All right. Uh, some other headlines, Loki.

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:09.420
Uh, so we just recently had a quake con. And with that, we got the announcement

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:18.780
of a quake to remaster. So it is the original game, but better and now out on Xbox series,

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:25.740
X and S and PC, and which is kind of surprising eight player split screen.

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.180
That's pretty rad.

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:33.820
It's pretty awesome. And, um, you know, being that it's a very probably light game to run on

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:39.980
those consoles, uh, that's probably how you can get away with that. But, um, he said right now

01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:48.780
it is, um, also going to be, or apparently quick three arena is also being, um, or has been

01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:56.300
remastered as well, or is coming in, I guess for other, that's the best one. Yeah. So, um,

01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:03.740
very cool. Yeah. I, I haven't played quake two and I remember quake two, not nearly as well received

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:08.700
as one and three. Um, and, uh, but I, I'll check it. I mean, especially, I believe it's on game

01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:13.180
pass. So what's to stop me from checking it out. Uh, the multiplayer is always a lot of fun in

01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:17.020
those games. So, um, yeah, I might have to grab that on game pass and check it out. It sounds

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:25.660
like a lot of fun. So cool. All right. Hmm. So neat, neat. All right. Moving on dark Sakura.

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:33.820
Um, there is a new mobile game coming out in the final fantasy seven universe. That's, uh,

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:41.260
going to add some backstory and be, uh, another little bit in the, in the whole series. Like

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:47.020
basically it's called final fantasy seven ever crisis that expands the story and the universe.

01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:55.660
Um, but also retells, um, uh, more of what went on in final fantasy seven. Um, it's, uh, developed

01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:05.100
by Apple bot, um, and, uh, other people involved in it for, uh, for, uh, as a scenario writer,

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:11.180
executive producer and creative director is, uh, Nogima Kazushige, Kitasi Yoshinori,

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:18.700
and Nomura Tetsuya respectively. And it's, uh, hearkening back to the chibi days of,

01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:22.140
of final fantasy seven in the early ones, but cloud has hands.

01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:29.100
Um, but it also does, but it also does include some stuff from the first soldier's backstory,

01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:36.460
which is another mobile game, and it will be free to play, but there are gotcha aspects,

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:43.020
you know, like a gotcha bond to get weapons that you would put money into. Oh, there you go.

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:49.020
Um, I never realized this YYR in chat says, um, there's a bunch of bonus material in the

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:54.140
quake two remaster. I learned that it was never actually meant to be quake two until they ran out

01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:58.140
of time and couldn't come up with a good name and branding for it. So they called it quake two,

01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:02.460
added a nail to the logo and called it a day. Uh, makes sense when you consider they have almost

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:06.380
nothing in common beyond the engine. Interesting. I never realized that that's interesting. Now,

01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:09.660
the break man commenting on that story, the dark soccer just read saying, uh, I wish

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:15.260
Squeenix would give six, some of the love they give to seven. Yes. I think, I think there's a

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:19.260
yes. I think, I think there's a lot of expanded universes. We'd like to see for some of the

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:24.540
classic final fantasy games. At least we finally got the pixel remasters on consoles. Don't forget.

01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.980
I mean, we had it on PC, but we got the console releases for switch and PlayStation

01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:31.980
earlier this year. So there is that. And if you haven't checked out six and that, um,

01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:36.060
it's very good from what I understand. I need to play. I still need to stream those games,

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:39.900
but here's my problem. I kind of just don't want to play Final Fantasy two. So I think,

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:44.620
I think I am going to skip. I think I'm going to skip and I'm going to play like Final Fantasy

01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:50.460
four and six, and then maybe go back to three and five. Um, and then play two,

01:49:51.260 --> 01:50:00.860
maybe as a channel point reward or something or something, or maybe I just I'll play more

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:06.780
tunic instead. Uh, it's probably time better spent. All right. Um, I would also like to see

01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:13.980
a sequel to 16 for the record. I hope we get another game in the 16 universe. Um, but you know,

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:16.780
I still feel like there's a lot of things that could tie up in the story, but

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:23.580
I digress. Uh, the break band of chat says, am I the only one that didn't hate two? No,

01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:29.180
I'm sure you're not the only one that didn't hate two, but, um, maybe tonight you are. All right,

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:38.220
let's move on to Loki. So this is interesting. Apparently the team behind some of the more

01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:46.460
popular multiplayer mods for grant of five and Reddit at redemption to, um, CFX dot re

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:53.340
they are P coming part of rockstar games. So they're known for the, uh, mods, uh, five M

01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:59.500
and red M, which is, I think he's more by the role-play community to play some alternative,

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:05.100
um, versions of the game within those two games, but now they're being rolled into

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:12.700
rockstar games. He says a huge step forward in the growth of our community and, uh, an opportunity

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:17.740
for us to work with rockstar games to advance the five M platform and the creative community

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:22.220
surrounding it. While our day to day operations won't have any noticeable changes with rockstar

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:25.980
support, we're going to continue to improve our platform. And we are truly excited for what this

01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:31.900
means for our users, community and creators. Uh, it's funny though, because literally a few years

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:38.060
ago, they rockstar was kind of trashing them saying that the five M project is not an authorized

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:44.060
alternate multiplayer service that contains code to design to facilitate piracy. Our policy on such

01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:48.220
violations in terms of service are clear and the individuals involved in this creation have had

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:55.660
their social clubs accounts suspended. Way to go rockstar games. You guys are just bang up jobs.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:01.980
It's almost as if you can be more productive working with your fans that are, they smell

01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:06.300
the money is what they did. They smell the opportunity to make money is they're like

01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:12.540
that too. We can monetize this. That's why they're tuned. You can't monetize banning people unless

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:18.700
you're charging them to unban them. Don't steal that trademark patent pending. That would fly

01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:24.140
anyway. So I think this is going to probably be a good indicator. What grand theft auto six and GTA

01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:29.020
online two is going to look like is, you know, some more of this role play stuff in there as

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:33.340
well since it's been popular. I mean, yeah, a lot of people have been into it. It's really

01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.660
fascinating. There's some Twitch channels and stuff that do it that, uh, is really interesting.

01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:43.020
So it's hard to believe that this game has been out for like, I know it's almost a classic game

01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:49.820
of the week already. Just about we'll see about that. I'll be the judge of that. Well,

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:56.060
Loki might say when you're sick one grand theft auto online aside, like I don't like

01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:01.100
grand theft auto. I, I liked the idea of grand theft auto online, but they ruined it like big

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:05.980
time, like with what they did to it. All the monetization is just really bad, but some of

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:12.060
the features in it are good. This, the single player game, very good. So like, I mean it,

01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:18.620
that stands alone on its, on its own, but yeah, online is just kind of, I like the races. I like

01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:25.580
the world, but like charging for literally everything is just awful. All right. Well,

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:29.420
before we get to the listener round table tonight, I have one more story and this is going to make

01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:33.660
some people sad, but I really don't think this news is as bad as people are making it out to be.

01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:40.060
And that is that the Xbox game pass $1 trial is now being shortened. You used to be able to get

01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:46.460
one month of Xbox game pass for the low, low price of $1. But now this introductory offer,

01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:53.900
it's been halved. You only get two weeks for your $1 of Xbox game pass. And this is just

01:53:53.900 --> 01:54:00.140
conveniently in time that star field is about to come out on Xbox game pass in a matter of weeks

01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:04.220
at this point. Really. I think the early access is happening while I'm away at dragon combat,

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:07.820
the retail releases right after I returned, which would be the general game pass release as well.

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:13.500
So it does kind of line up that that would be a potential reason why they don't want people

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:20.940
playing and beating starfield for a dollar. Look, let's be honest. Many of us worked swindled,

01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:28.140
stretched, exploited the Xbox game pass system quite some time ago. It's been years. And when

01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:35.820
I say that, I mean, there were many people that loaded up on the dollar, the really cheap Xbox

01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:41.820
game or gold sales, converting that into Xbox game pass for three years and all that. Look,

01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:50.060
we've had our day times up starfield was not a cheap game to make two weeks is still not bad.

01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:54.220
If you're really not sure if you want game pass or not, but I kind of think, you know,

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:59.340
at this point of game passes for you or not, and you probably should pay what it's worth to play

01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:04.540
starfield a little bit. So, but I'm sure, look, there's still, there's still ways that people

01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:09.260
are going to work the system hint. Cause I did this with Swiss. This is just being thrifty

01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:13.980
on the Nintendo switch. And I know I've told the story on the show. I'm going to tell it again,

01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:18.540
cause this works for Xbox as well. You can get at Costco and I'm sure there's similar deals

01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:25.660
out there. You can get $100 worth of Nintendo cards for $90. And then you can use that $100

01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:31.660
that you got for $90 to then get the two game voucher, which in turn you can use on the $70.

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:39.020
I'm like, what is star soccer doing with her hands? Is she mapping on her fingers over there?

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.260
I'm playing with my motion capture.

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:47.020
Yeah, no, it's fine. Then you can get tiers of the kingdom for $70, meaning for the low, low price

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:55.100
of $20, you can get a $60 retail game because you mapped the thing and you took advantage. Now you

01:55:55.100 --> 01:56:00.380
could do a similar thing with Xbox, which I believe Costco and probably other outlets also

01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:07.100
sell a hundred dollars worth of cards for 90 bucks. And honestly around events like black Friday

01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:11.900
or, you know, around maybe the day after Christmas. No, usually not. Cause they want

01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:17.100
people to spend their gift cards at full value, but usually you'll find other deals to get these

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:21.420
types of things like, you know, a PlayStation plus is one of them as well. You get them real cheap.

01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:26.860
So just something to keep an eye out for you can be thrifty and there's many websites out there,

01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:32.540
many social media feeds, uh, that help you be thrifty on your game shopping.

01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:39.580
So, all right. Uh, let's see. YYR in chat says, if you're all in on Xbox use Microsoft rewards,

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:44.700
you can earn one free month of game pass ultimate every month. If you're okay with doing dailies,

01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:50.140
using edge and being playing their games, et cetera. So basically GPU is free forever.

01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:54.060
I was actually doing that for a long time and it was very effective. I would say I was maybe

01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:59.740
getting every other month free, but still it's a great way to do it. They also up to the number

01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:05.260
of points you need to redeem that now, but I'm not arguing the point because it's still a very

01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:11.020
thrifty way to get a month here or a month there of Xbox ultimate. And again, if you want to,

01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:16.940
you know, save up your points and redeem a couple of those at once, that might be another way to

01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:22.140
play star field, if that's the way you want to do it. So something to think about. Oh, interesting.

01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:27.580
YYR says the auto redeem price did not go up. I didn't realize that. That's fascinating. Okay.

01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:34.940
Good to know. Good to know. SSG100 Matt says I always do the Costco gift card thing with Disney

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:45.340
cards before going to Disney world. Oh, clever, clever. Shane in chat says I use edge and I

01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:50.060
randomly have earned like 20 bucks. And I don't know how much, how now I have, how I have that

01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:54.700
much or whatever he's trying to say there. So what you, you can turn those into Xbox points and buy,

01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:59.100
I think you can even turn it into windows store credit. If you're like, I don't want to hook up

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:02.620
my Xbox or whatever. Like you can, there's a lot you could do with that. You should look into that.

01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:09.180
All right. Well, we should look right now at our mailbag every week. You can participate with,

01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:14.940
you can participate with our show, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send an email.

01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:21.340
And I think, Oh, Shane says you can turn it into PayPal money really, but it's not going to be as

01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:26.300
good of a value. It's just money. Yeah. Money's good. Money's good. That's right. You can get

01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:30.140
things like target gift cards and stuff on there too. So I guess there is that. All right. All

01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:35.660
that chat aside, let's get to the emails tonight and the rest of our listener roundtables. So

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:41.020
Dar Sakura. I'm actually trying to check the calendar cause there's a lot of spam in here too.

01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:48.780
So that was the, all right. Between August 31st.

01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:53.660
I saw one today. If you can find the one from today, I think that was the only one I noticed.

01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:59.660
Yeah. No, there were, there were a couple. There was one from, from the first and from the third

01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:04.940
by the same person. No, sorry. This one is the spam one that it wouldn't let me delete. There

01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:12.860
we go. All right. So yeah. Okay. Here we go. So hello, LR, long time, no email. I just figured

01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:17.900
I'd say hello and also send a long-winded comment regarding something discussed during the last

01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:23.340
episode and my poor broken eyes. I need to make this must be YYR because it opened hello, LR.

01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:30.460
Yes. Okay. So Microsoft rebranded the Xbox live gold as Xbox game pass core, taking a look at

01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:35.660
25 game library available to give us course subscribers. Loki wondered why folks

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:40.140
wouldn't just pay, excuse me, hiccups. Wouldn't just pay the extra $1 and opt for game pass

01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:45.740
for console instead. But there's something there that lucky missed. Xbox game pass core provides

01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:52.140
access to online multiplayer. Xbox game pass for console does not. So in order to have both the

01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:56.300
real game pass and the online multiplayer, you need to subscribe to game pass. Oh,

01:59:56.300 --> 02:00:00.940
that's shady. I miss that too. Oh my goodness. All right. Sorry.

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:05.500
So at the end of the day, this isn't much different from the previous setup.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:10.620
After all game pass for console never included Xbox live gold before. I don't blame Loki for

02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:15.500
getting this wrong. The only reason why he got it wrong was because the new branding is to be blunt,

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:21.580
absolute bullshit. If you look at almost any popular tiered service, higher tiers include

02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:25.900
all the features of the tiers below them. These don't, which is super confusing to the point of

02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:31.260
being anti-consumer. Frankly, I am all struck at just how terrible this branding is. I expect that

02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:36.620
Microsoft would soon be flooded with support tickets from folks that expected online multiplayer

02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:43.020
for the $11 tier and didn't receive it. I get that they want to say they have more game pass

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:48.220
subscribers than ever. And that was probably their main motivation behind this move. I get that they

02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:53.180
want to unite all of the subscriptions under one brand because that's what a lot of corporations

02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:59.500
do. But if that's what they wanted, I believe they should have just jacked the game pass console,

02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:05.100
priced a few more bucks, maybe to 14 and included all the multiplayer. Yeah, it would suck a little

02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:09.740
for the folks who aren't interested in multiplayer, but be a lot less confusing for everyone or

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:14.460
perhaps even better, maybe they should just have left all of this alone. We're familiar with the

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:18.860
current system and branding, so why mess it up at all? All right, capitalism, sigh.

02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:25.100
Anyway, that sucks, but you know what doesn't suck? Recently, someone set a new world record

02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:31.900
for Dance Pad speed running the original Legend of Zelda. You might ask, who you might ask? This guy.

02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:37.340
You can check out my Twitch or YouTube channels if you're interested in seeing this,

02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:41.500
or if you want to see a recent play test of some of the stuff I recently added to

02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:46.460
SuperDuper Multitasking, like the fast forward feature and the new single player gauntlet mode.

02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:50.380
But whether you check that stuff out or not, happy gaming. And of course, to our glorious

02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:54.380
hosts, thank you again for this show and have a great week. Keep on stepping YYR.

02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:01.020
Of course, you're the one that set the speed run for the original Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad.

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:07.740
This just sounds so you, and actually, you know I'm going to do this. Sorry. I'm going to pirate

02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:13.740
some content from YYR's YouTube channel, but I will point out you can find YYR on YouTube at

02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:20.780
YYR57695. You can find the channel there, and I'll just show you a little preview of what it

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:26.940
looks like to actually run the Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad, and it's exactly what you'd think.

02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:33.500
That's, oh my God, yes, with the buttons and everything. That's incredible. Anyway,

02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:36.380
while we watch YYR speed run the Legend of Zelda on a Dance Pad,

02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:40.140
and actually, can I say this too? How long is the speed run?

02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:49.180
Just under two hours. YYR, you hella need to submit them. Yes, I'm using the trademark

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:55.420
Northern California term of hella. You should hella submit this speed run to Games Done Quick.

02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:01.740
You really need to think about submitting the speed run to Games Done Quick. I'm just saying,

02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:06.460
I'm just saying. Anyway, if you can, yeah, I know that means time away and all that stuff,

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:10.220
and you have a young one at home. But while we watch YYR do that on Twitch,

02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:12.700
I want to mention- It just occurred to me.

02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:15.820
What's that? I could do my rod caliber speed run.

02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:24.620
You could. YYR says it's not quick. It doesn't need to be. They do a Kingdom Hearts run that's

02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:28.380
like three hours long. You just have to be faster than other people doing it.

02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:33.100
Exactly, and the fact that you're doing it on a Dance Pad is fucking funny. I don't know,

02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:37.020
but I also know the pressure of that could be a lot, so I'm not going to push the issue,

02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:44.300
but I am going to say YYR, this is quirky enough that I think people would eat it up. I really do,

02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:47.580
but if you don't want to do it, I completely respect that choice.

02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:55.740
But I do want to respond to the part in YYR's email where he talks about including multiplayer

02:03:55.740 --> 02:04:05.500
by jacking up the price a little bit to $14 and doing that. Here's a hot take, take it or leave

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:10.860
it. I've been saying this for years. Why doesn't Microsoft just fucking eat the price already and

02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:20.540
give it to you for free? Because there is this disparity as there has been for years that you

02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:26.220
have games on the Windows Store that have multiplayer on them, and you don't need Xbox Live

02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:31.500
to play those multiplayer. I'm not going to put that thought in Microsoft's head. They would get

02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:42.140
eaten alive for that type of stuff though. If they want to have parity with what's going on on PC,

02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:49.660
they really should just make it fucking free for multiplayer on Xbox console anyway. Why not stick

02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:55.340
it to Sony when you have a chance? I don't know. It just seems a little silly to me,

02:04:55.980 --> 02:05:01.660
but money, money, money. That's the end of the day. Money, money, money, whatever. Anyway,

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:09.020
thank you YYR for the email. I do notice you're doing a great job, so I don't want you to take

02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:14.860
this the wrong way, but I am noting if you did this again and again, you probably could really

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:21.500
optimize this run even more. So I have a feeling whether it's on the stage of GDQ or not,

02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:24.860
this is something we're going to see YYR do again, because this is kind of

02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:28.540
this is kind of rad actually. I really love this. I agree.

02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:35.660
Breakman in chat says this guy is doing better with a mat than I can with a controller.

02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:39.580
This guy, he's right there. Breakman, he's sitting right next to you in the chat room.

02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:50.220
Turn to your left. Well, you know, just if anyone decides to ever use Dreamcast dance pads,

02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:56.460
the Konami logo is one of the attack buttons or that's how I beat dance caliber.

02:05:57.180 --> 02:06:03.180
There you go. Also use Taki. We have a call waiting in the green.

02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:06.140
I have another email. Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought,

02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:09.180
nevermind. Just kidding. Let's do the email and then we'll do the call.

02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:16.060
All right. This comes from Retertainment. This week, the ESRB submitted a post to the

02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:21.580
FTC to allow companies that sell video games to utilize facial recognition software as a way to

02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:27.740
verify the ages of potential customers. Now we can debate the effectiveness of such a proposal

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:32.220
as well as whether or not potential customers trust pictures to such a system, but there's

02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:37.980
another question to be asked. Why is ESRB proposing this? I believe I have an answer.

02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:43.900
In May, Pornhub started blocking access to users in several cities, including Utah,

02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:48.380
instead of state, sorry, instead of Utah, over age verification laws passed in those states.

02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:52.700
In response to that legislation, many porn sites started rolling out facial recognition programs

02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:56.700
for its users that live in those states. From personal experience, I can attest that

02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:02.060
the program utilized by those porn sites are similar to the program that the ESRB is proposing.

02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:07.260
So, can it be argued that the ESRB is being proactive about potential upcoming issues?

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.620
After all, video games rank up there with porn as boogeyman and

02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:13.900
scapegoat notes that are used by conservatives. Take care of Retertainment.

02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:24.300
Interesting. That is so weird how they banned porn in certain states. Like,

02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:27.340
I'm sure people just use VPNs to get around it and all that stuff anyway.

02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:31.180
Right. They just block in IPs that come from a certain state. That's all they're doing.

02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:35.660
Yeah. At the same time, though, I mean,

02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:48.220
having the age verification on those sites, it's a good idea. I mean, in theory, maybe even to a

02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:55.980
degree in practice, but you're also dealing with the potential recording of minors without parental

02:07:55.980 --> 02:08:03.020
consent. They'll just store it temporarily, I'm sure. And then later on, it'll leak out that they

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:07.020
stored those images to train their AI. Some are going to argue it's still being

02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:13.660
recorded though, whether it's sent anywhere or not. And plus, I don't see how facial recognition

02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:21.180
software works. It's not a flawless system. And there's a lot of like 16 and 17 that grow

02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:26.860
full facial hair and stuff. It's wild. Did I ever tell you about my friend who,

02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:31.900
at the time, her six-year-old daughter could unlock her mother's iPhone with her own face?

02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:38.700
Oh my gosh. Because their facial structure was like they were almost twins, just one was older.

02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:46.700
Or identical twins actually doing the same thing. I had a friend in elementary school who went

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:51.500
through puberty at a super early age. He was growing facial hair in the fifth grade.

02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:54.060
Oh.

02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.100
Yeah, it happens.

02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:58.940
I went through it in third grade at nine years old.

02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:01.020
Wow. So I feel like-

02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:03.820
I was the first kid with boobs.

02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:10.940
There's too many issues with this. I mean, yeah, at least the ESRB is trying to get out in front

02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:15.020
of it, but try again. That's my comment on that.

02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:21.340
And YYR says, the party of smaller government and less regulation, hypocritical shitheads.

02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:31.660
Basically, they just want to control the things that they don't agree with, like bodies

02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:35.020
and let everyone kill each other.

02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:41.900
Look at the stunt that was attempted in Ohio, like case in point. That's it. Anyway,

02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:43.820
we have one more email, right?

02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:49.340
No, that was the second one because I said we had- you said we had one. I said we had two.

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:52.700
Well, I see a third that came in at 634.

02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:54.060
What?

02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:59.660
For fuck sake. No, I don't see another one.

02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:02.780
Oh, okay.

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:11.740
Hey, OLRs, Jim, Sally and Daniel here. Choo-choo babies. You guys ever play a game on Steam called

02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:18.300
Rounds? A roguelike game, crazy jumpy, lots of goofy power-ups. It's taken over our gaming

02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:23.580
lives. Best $6 buck worth of gaming since Minecraft. Let us know if you want to play

02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:26.860
sometime. Chats later. XOXO, Jim, Sally and Daniel.

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:33.180
A short, sweet, succinct email. Love it. Yeah. Your recommendation means a lot to me,

02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:39.260
Jim, Sally. I've not heard of it, but I do love me a cheap game. So I'll have to take a look at it.

02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:40.380
What game was that again?

02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:43.820
Rounds? Have you heard of this? I'm opening up my Steam.

02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:48.540
That and I need to buy Danger-esque because it plays on Apple.

02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:50.380
I'm actually trying to see-

02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:57.900
So the game that comes up for me is a card game? Is that the game?

02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:02.380
I don't think it is because they were saying it was roguelike. I'll have to find it because

02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:05.100
the game that comes up for me when I search on YouTube is a card game and I don't think

02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:07.500
that's the right game. It's a 1v1 roguelike shooter.

02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.100
There's a link in chat.

02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:13.260
Ah, perfect. I was looking for like a YouTube gameplay, but that's all right. Okay,

02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:15.500
I'll check that out later after the show. Thanks for the rec though.

02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:19.420
And it's always good to hear from you, Jim, Sally and Daniel, of course.

02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:19.900
Choo-choo.

02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:25.580
And thank you for being one of my many guides in Disney Dreamlight Valley.

02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.340
All right. Now we're done with email, yes?

02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:30.860
Yes.

02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:31.820
All complete? Finished?

02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:33.100
Yes.

02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:40.940
Participate at orangelandradio.com. Now we can get to the telephone or in technology, the Discord.

02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:44.780
Let's bring in our caller for tonight who has been patiently waiting. Hi,

02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:46.460
you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:52.380
Hey, what a well-timed cough from Dark Sakura.

02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:52.940
Sorry.

02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:54.300
I believe I heard that was Shane.

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:57.740
Yeah, I guess I'm passing COVID through the internet.

02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:00.140
Oh no. Oh no, it's mutating again.

02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:01.340
It's called garlic bread.

02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:04.220
Well, I hope you're feeling better, Shane.

02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:11.980
I am. I have my voice mostly back, but I went and did Pokemon Community Day today for an hour,

02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:14.300
and that was a stupid idea.

02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:16.540
I thought you rage quit Go, and now you're back on it.

02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:22.540
I did, but I rage unquit too when there's a Pokemon I like, and it was Froakie.

02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:24.380
How am I supposed to pass up Froakie?

02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:25.020
Even I is so-

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:26.620
You and your water types.

02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:29.100
It's true. It is me and my water types.

02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:33.740
It is so fucking hot here today, and I hate how they schedule these things.

02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:37.820
While there's a fucking heatwave going on, schedule it at the hottest point of the day.

02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:43.260
I get it. The globe is a big place, and they need to do something that works for

02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:47.420
Northern and Southern Hemisphere, but I'm really, really signing more and more onto

02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:52.860
the idea that they need to let us pick from three different three-hour windows what works

02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:54.860
best for us and do it that way. I know it's possible.

02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:58.380
Or even just the 11 to two or two to five. That's it.

02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:01.900
You just pick one of those two. You don't need to do three. That's just what it should be.

02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:04.540
But it was like 90, I think, here.

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:09.180
But I got in the car. I couldn't find my Bluetooth Pokeball, which pissed me off.

02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:11.420
It's somewhere hiding in the house.

02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:16.140
But I got in the car, and I drove to one park, pulled over, caught all the Froakie there,

02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:19.660
and then drove to the park down the street, caught all the Froakie there, and I got two

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:23.820
shinies. I was like, you know what? One of these is a two-star. Good enough for me.

02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:27.820
I'm done with Froakie Community Day. I'll catch up in December when the weather is better.

02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:31.900
Well, I timed it for right after seeing the Barbie movie.

02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:35.100
So I just went from the Barbie movie to go catch Froakie.

02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:35.900
Let's go see it.

02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:43.100
It's so good. It is so good. I cannot sing its praises enough. I want to see it again.

02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:45.820
For some reason, I'm actually surprised to hear this from you. You don't strike me as

02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:52.380
the type that usually likes those kind of quotably silly comedy movies. It depends on the movie.

02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:59.420
Honestly, the humor was my type of humor. I did not expect that. And I loved so much,

02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:02.060
and I laughed so many times.

02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:05.740
Phil of Nine says, OMG, go see Barbie. What are y'all waiting for?

02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:10.700
So not to be a downer, but I do want to just gently remind. I was in Atlanta the weekend

02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:14.940
that it came out, and then my dad got really sick the next weekend, which was earmarked.

02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:17.180
I should have seen it this weekend, but I just didn't get around to do it.

02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:18.060
You were supposed to go.

02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:20.620
Yeah, I know, but things.

02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:26.460
So I do want to I want to brag that for my one hour of playing today,

02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:30.060
I did get 30 froakie shinies. So I was happy.

02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.020
You're disgusting.

02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:36.860
All right. What did you want to call it? You didn't want to talk about go with us tonight,

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:37.660
though. What do you want to know?

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:42.300
But I, of course, want to talk about Pokemon because it's like the only thing I live and

02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:48.620
breathe. So you guys talked about Pokemon presents, but you left off something very

02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:55.180
important from presents in that they showed off four new Pokemon in Scarlet and Violet.

02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:57.980
Oh, that's right. The redos, right?

02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:05.180
It's not. Well, I don't know what you mean by redos, but no, no, it's not just that. So

02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:13.180
they did show off Raging Bolt and Iron Crown, which are paradox forms of Raikou and Cobolion.

02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:13.680
OK, that.

02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:19.680
Yes, but beyond that, they had two new evolutions for previously

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:25.920
existing Pokemon. Applin, which debuted in Galar Gen 8,

02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:34.880
used to only be known to evolve into Flapple. And I don't even remember the other one.

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:37.520
That's the fat stupid one. I don't remember what his name is.

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:46.160
But now he has an evolution called Diplen, where he looks like a candy apple. It's adorable.

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.360
Yeah, I did. OK, I did see that. It was cute.

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:55.040
And then Duraludon, also from Galar, has an evolution, didn't have one before,

02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:00.880
into Archiludon. He just looks like a bridge. I actually kind of dig it. It's neat.

02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:04.160
But that's what you...

02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:08.400
One of them looks like that monster from Horizon Forbidden Dawn.

02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:12.160
That is Raging Bolt. Yes, it looks like a Tallnick from

02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:16.800
Horizon. Because that was in the VR demo thing I saw at Bobby's.

02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:25.280
Yeah, it's ridiculous. But more importantly than Pokemon Presents was that Pokemon Worlds

02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:33.120
ended this morning in the US around like 3am. And they had a whole bunch of new information

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:40.160
for their various games. The first being Pokemon Unite, they announced three new characters.

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:46.960
Blaziken, Mimikyu, and Meowth Skirata. So the grass cat is already in that game,

02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:54.880
which is frustrating. The Pokemon TCG is adding two new types of cards, Ancient and Future,

02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:59.280
but we don't know what they do. But for Scarlet and Violet DLC,

02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:07.440
the part two, the indigo disc, is adding all gen one through eight starters in the wild.

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.880
You'll be able to catch them. A 19th teratype. I don't know what you're doing on screen. Are

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:18.000
you riding a roller coaster? I don't get it. It's... Jamie's avatar looks like it literally

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.680
passed away. Like when you were talking about Pokemon.

02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:25.600
Oh, I see it. Yeah. I was just trying to mimic it because it was so funny.

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:29.120
Like we just both died because you won't shut up about Pokemon.

02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:33.280
No, I don't. I will talk about till everybody's dead. I don't care. It's fine.

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:43.360
And so 19th teratype. And there's also new competitive moves that like one blocks healing

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:50.560
from abilities and moves. And that's pretty cool. Also Pokemon Worlds next year is in Honolulu,

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:58.720
Hawaii. So I very much want to go. I've already decided. Japan looked like a lot of fun. Way more

02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:03.760
fun than Fan Fest, which was the two things I wanted to decide between this year. So I'm gonna

02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:06.880
there's no Fan Fest next year. I want to go to...

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:11.040
Now, don't spoil the video because I want people to go to our YouTube channel and check out your

02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:15.280
Fan Fest reactions in the video. You already do sound better today than you did even three

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:16.880
days ago in that video, though. So...

02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:23.120
Yeah, I've got everything I had back then except my voice is back. So everything else is fine.

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:23.620
Yeah.

02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:31.860
Oh, but yeah, that's all the Pokemon news. And I did. I did buy Baldur's Gate 3 because

02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:36.820
I'm getting sucked into the hype. I have not played it yet. Because, you know, Steam has

02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:43.060
that two hours and you can refund it or with whatever within two hours. So I haven't even

02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:47.780
turned it on yet. I'm waiting for a period of like two hours straight where I can just kind of

02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:51.700
try it and see if I like it. Because it looked a lot like Dragon Age to me.

02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:53.780
Oh, what?

02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:55.220
So why can't it be two hours gay?

02:18:57.220 --> 02:19:03.140
Whatever. That's stupid. Anyway. Yeah. So I'm excited to play that because it looked like

02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:07.300
Dragon Age Origins to me. I was like, well, I love that game. So maybe this will be...

02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:11.700
No, it does. It does give me big Dragon Age vibes, actually. Which is funny because Baldur's Gate is

02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:16.260
like, it's actually like an old classic. Like, those games have been out before. Like, it's

02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:19.780
number three for a reason, right? It's been years since it's been a long time since 2.

02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:25.540
But like, they're very classic, well known, you know, PC games. But yeah, I never got into them.

02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:30.820
I'm almost tempted to buy three. Shane, if I buy three, will you create a character that we can

02:19:30.820 --> 02:19:34.420
play together like on stream or something? Well, you know, I love creating characters.

02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:39.220
So I would probably be down for that. I just have to make sure I'm down for the game. Because I asked

02:19:39.220 --> 02:19:43.380
somebody, would I like it? Explaining, you know, I only... I've never played D&D. I don't know

02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:46.740
anything about that stuff. But I've played Dragon Age. I was like, oh, this looks like Dragon Age.

02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:50.980
And like, yeah, but there's a lot of dice rolls. I'm like, that's fine. That usually just happens

02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:57.060
behind the scenes. So I'm sure it'll be okay. I mean, I've played D&D. To be quite honest,

02:19:57.060 --> 02:20:03.140
like a lot of what we see in role playing games today is because of D&D. So like,

02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:08.740
if you were to play D&D, you'd be like, there's a certain familiarity to this, because I've played

02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:15.940
literally any RPG, you know? Yeah. And I hear there's like, just so much in terms of like,

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:22.820
branching story paths, and just like, all these little things that affect the overall outcome.

02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:29.860
Like, that sounds very overwhelming and scary, but also very cool. Because like, I can't play

02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:35.220
Mass Effect anyway, but one way. All my decisions are exactly the same when I play it. So I don't

02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:39.620
know how I would handle a game like this. That would just break me. Especially when I'm doing

02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:44.100
things to intentionally and deliberately shock you. Yeah, and then I will just kill you.

02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:52.420
I'm gonna tell you when Baldur's Gate 3 caught my attention. So please plug the kids ears for

02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:57.540
a minute here. It was when they showed that scene where you can like, fuck the bear. I was like,

02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:03.780
that that's in a video game. I didn't even watch that. It's a druid thing. Like the druid shape

02:21:03.780 --> 02:21:10.180
shifts and they, you know, Discovery Channel, etc. So I was like, this is incredible. What is

02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:15.220
this game? I need to have it. I did see that they like, I saw like a patch notes where they had to

02:21:15.220 --> 02:21:20.580
fix penises. I was like, this is hilarious. Like, this game is going to be amazing.

02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:26.180
All right, or something. Well, we have another call waiting to get on. So,

02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:29.940
Shane, I'm gonna let you go. But thanks so much for joining us tonight. I appreciate it.

02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:35.300
No problem. Bye. Take care. Bye. All right. As I promised, we have another call waiting

02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:39.700
to come on air. So let's do it. Hello. You are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:47.700
This is Choo Choo Jim Sally. Jim Sally. Jim Sally. Always a pleasure to hear from you.

02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:54.020
Is Daniel with you too? Daniel is asleep in bed, so now we may speak at an R-rated level.

02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:58.500
Oh, good. I'm glad to hear. He stayed up just long enough to hear you guys read our email

02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:04.020
from today. He's fucking on. That's awesome. I love that. I'm glad he didn't hear the part

02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:09.780
about the bear. That's what I did. That's the last one. I just turned down before you call.

02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:24.900
Yeah. I'm hoping that animal kingdom thing and not a Toronto church and lovely kind of thing.

02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:30.260
It's hashtag just druid things. So what's on your mind tonight, Jim Sally? To what do we

02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:37.380
all the call? Well, I was good about also, I'm just finishing this J. I was good about that

02:22:37.380 --> 02:22:42.900
round game that I'm talking about. Yeah. So one versus one game where you shoot each other and

02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:49.140
then the loser gets to pick a little power up. Like maybe they jumped further or they have poison

02:22:49.140 --> 02:22:53.620
bullets or some shit, and then you fight again. And then the loser of that next battle gets to

02:22:53.620 --> 02:23:00.660
win. And my boy has been still obsessed with this game. It's been, it's unbelievable. When I think

02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:07.700
about how much money I've spent on other games for him to die in a day or two. But this stupid

02:23:07.700 --> 02:23:13.700
$6 one v one game. It's just tucked them in. I think I think they put something in the background

02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:18.180
where it flashes that it hypnotizes you or something. Is this the game on here that I just

02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:25.060
put onto the discord? Oh, you got it. This is it. Okay. This is all it is, man. It's it's the

02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:31.060
I can't believe it. This looks like the type of video game that they have playing at conventions

02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:36.500
that have time. Okay, I see the power ups. Okay, I get it. This was a type of video game like stick

02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:43.300
fight a whole bunch of people are crowding around a TV. It's giving me big. Oh, fuck. What's that

02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:48.500
10 player Killer Queen? I'm getting big Killer Queen vibes. We were we were there when Killer

02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:53.860
Queen was just being introduced. Yeah, they had one at Southern Fright. And funny enough,

02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:58.660
on the plane ride, very random aside on the plane ride out to Atlanta from Sacramento,

02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:03.540
I met a guy that works with Killer Queen. And he was going to the same show. And I overheard him

02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:07.620
in line. And I was like, he's like, Yeah, I'm going out to Atlanta for a gaming show. And I just,

02:24:07.620 --> 02:24:11.220
you know, you know, me, I'm not shy sometimes. I was like, are you going to Southern Fright Game

02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:15.380
Expo? I turned around. He's like, Yeah. And so we ended up talking. I saw it was really funny.

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:20.020
So cool. I wish I'd got his business card. I would have invited them on the show. But I

02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:21.620
thought I'd see him at the show and I never did.

02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:24.980
Well, still, yeah.

02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:30.820
That game does look really fun, though. For $6. I checked that out. And there's a shit ton of

02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:37.380
YouTubes out there. My goodness. Oh, my God, it's unbelievable. We actually saw one the other day I

02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:42.980
cracked my my modding cherry the other day, and actually learned how to mod a video game on the

02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:49.780
PC for the first time. Really? You'd be so proud of me. I download all of us who play The Sims.

02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:56.740
I know, right? I know, right? Or Minecraft. All the 12 year olds in my life know how to do it on

02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:04.100
Minecraft. I didn't want to ask them because I felt stupid. Not us getting to that age where

02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:08.580
the 12 year olds are showing us how to do things that was when I was 12. That was programming the

02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:14.020
VCR. That was the thing that, you know, my parents who were, you know, in their 50s at the time had

02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:19.380
to rely on the youngins to do is program the VCR. So my mom didn't know how to do it. And I

02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:25.460
understood the whole concept of if you put it on EP, you get six hours of tape, but it doesn't look

02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:30.340
as good because it uses less tape. Like she didn't understand any of that. She was just like,

02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:38.580
can you just tape Oprah or not? Brother, I remember one day trying to explain to my parents

02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:44.420
about getting a second VCR so I could copy the videotape from the jumbo video. And it took me

02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:49.460
like two months of arguing with them and they wouldn't believe me. And then finally I had to

02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:54.500
borrow a second VCR from, this was eight years ago, kids, so copyright doesn't matter. Okay.

02:25:54.500 --> 02:26:01.300
It can bring the second VCR to my house. But I still remember my mom's face,

02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:04.340
like almost in tears that we were going to get free movies.

02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:09.540
Well, and also this is how you, you know, get over the ring virus.

02:26:13.940 --> 02:26:19.380
The funny thing about the videotape thing is that it's now starting to hit its nostalgia

02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:23.220
thing because you know what I'm seeing shared on social media now is things like

02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:29.140
I just found Titanic on VHS and we're watching it and fully having to switch the tape out and

02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:33.940
all that. And somebody else just yesterday on one of my feeds was like, I just found

02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:41.620
it still sealed the Star Wars release on VHS. It had a very distinct like look with the,

02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:45.780
like it was when they re-released it. Uh, I think it was after the initial initial release,

02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:49.540
they like re-released it like THX sound or whatever was the fancy thing. And it had a

02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:54.660
very unique like logo and like it was unopened and they were like, should I open it to watch it?

02:26:54.660 --> 02:26:57.460
What? I have those laser disks.

02:26:57.460 --> 02:26:59.540
Oh my gosh. Yeah.

02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:03.540
I do. And guess what? We got them at Dimple for 11 bucks each.

02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:04.580
Oh, that's funny.

02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:08.660
Back in the day. Of course, I also have just a spinal tap with the guitar pick on it too.

02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:13.700
And Questbuster Han shot only.

02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:19.780
I love that a Jim Salley phone call is here to tell us about a new video game and suddenly

02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:24.820
descends. Uh, of course, of course we need the conductor of the train here to drive this tangent

02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:41.300
train into a talk about VHS videotapes. Don't tape over Rob's Alice in Wonderland from TV

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:45.060
cause he'll get pissed. Carol Channing was in that, that, that, that. Anyway.

02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:50.820
I still remember the day my GM, they drove me over for fucking Dancing with the Stars.

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:52.020
Oh no.

02:27:52.020 --> 02:27:56.820
Fucking Dancing with the Stars. That was like the biggest heartbreak ever when you pop it in

02:27:56.820 --> 02:28:01.220
and Dancing with the Stars comes up. And I just want to watch some Cobra Commander. I even had

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:05.780
the, I even had the game series where that weird snake guy came over and there was an extra snake

02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:11.860
serpent or, and then they would all go and attack and shit. And it was fucking Dancing with the

02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:18.900
Stars, man. I had the whole run of Ronin Warriors taped off of VHS when I had my VCR set timed.

02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:23.700
And I realized that my VCR would actually start recording 25 minutes late. So I set it 25 minutes

02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:30.580
earlier. So I had every episode and then my brother taped over all the episodes with my

02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:34.980
favorite character who is Seiji, which I mean, I have them all in Japanese now, but still.

02:28:34.980 --> 02:28:39.140
Several people in chat, several people in chat are bringing up cause dark soccer mentioned the

02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:43.140
beta max. There's several people in chat bringing up that they too had a beta max. And actually in

02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:50.340
my family, we also had a beta max first. And that was when I fell in love with clue the movie. I had

02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:58.340
clue the movie with all three endings on beta. And I wore that fucking tape out. I was seven

02:28:58.340 --> 02:29:01.380
years old. Oh yeah. That was the big, that was the big thing with that movie. There were three

02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:05.140
different endings when they released it in theaters, you would only see one of the three

02:29:05.140 --> 02:29:10.180
endings. And it was, it was actually like in retrospect, there's a lot written about how that

02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:15.220
was actually horrible and detrimental to the movie's box office success because that movie

02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:21.620
found its footing when they would show it on TV over and over again on like, for me, it's channel

02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:26.820
31, but it's whatever your local independent, you know, a TV channel is. It just shows the movies

02:29:26.820 --> 02:29:33.700
all day long. They, they, and so many of us in that, you know, young, uh, you know, late Gen X,

02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:39.460
early millennial generation, like grew up watching clue the movie on TV over and over again with all

02:29:39.460 --> 02:29:44.580
three endings because they put it on VHS is had all the endings there and same thing on TV.

02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:49.380
That was one of my, one of my movies on repeat that the princess bride and high spirits.

02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:57.700
I love all day long. Yeah. Oh, good times. All right. Jim Sally, I'm loving this, uh,

02:29:57.700 --> 02:30:01.860
walk down memory lane, but I do have to wrap up so we can wrap up the show tonight, but Jim Sally,

02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:06.820
it's always a pleasure to hear from you. I'm going to check out rounds and, uh, please, uh,

02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:11.700
please send our best to Daniel. Okay. I will do probably good night, everybody.

02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:21.460
You take care. All right. Always a delight to hear from Jim Sally. What a guy, uh, I'm glad he's

02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:25.460
back. He's been gone for a little bit and it's, it's really nice to have him back in the circle.

02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:29.140
Now it's, it's like, uh, being reunited with an old friend. I appreciate it. Absolutely.

02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:34.340
Absolutely. Um, okay. Uh, we're getting towards the end of the show. Uh, I want to make sure we,

02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:38.180
uh, wrap up here and, uh, get the final thoughts out and all that good stuff. Uh,

02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:42.740
dark soccer. I know you are off to do your streaming thing. Um, so do you have a final

02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:52.100
thought for our listeners tonight? Um, only one, uh, one quote, so I chose to expose myself,

02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:56.180
please. There are ladies present. All right. Thank you. Excellent. All right. Perfect.

02:30:56.180 --> 02:31:00.900
Uh, I'm going to get on the Debbie train. All right. Later taters. Good luck. Have fun with

02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:05.860
that. All right. We'll see you in a little bit. Um, as always, I want to thank everybody for

02:31:05.860 --> 02:31:08.980
listening to orange launch radio tonight. If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show,

02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:12.660
tell a friend or to help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:17.140
a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air. So a nice five star review on a site like

02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:22.340
iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way. So, uh, would

02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:30.180
super appreciate all of that. Um, with that, I think we're down to the other final thoughts.

02:31:30.180 --> 02:31:32.340
So, um, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:38.740
Uh, my final thought was there was another game I played for my gaming week. I forgot to mention

02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:45.380
it. Um, it's, it's basically one of those, you know, how you have all those spam, um,

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:51.780
mobile game ads that have like, you know, you're no, never be smart enough to beat this type of

02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:58.500
thing. And they have the weird games on there. Well, they actually released a game that has those,

02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:03.780
uh, all in one collection. It has the most ridiculous title. It's called, yeah, you want

02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:09.380
those games, right? So here you go. Now let's see if you can clear them. That's the name of the game

02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:16.820
by the way. It's fun. All right. And then, uh, the other thing is, uh, there's going to be some major

02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:25.700
announcements next week. Just saying. Yes. Uh, on both from both of our ends. Yes, absolutely.

02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:30.260
I'm excited. Yours is real good though. That's all I'm going to say. All right. Um,

02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:37.060
so my final thought tonight, and you can blame dark soccer for this is well, someone's got to

02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:40.420
break the ice and it might as well be me. I mean, I'm used to being a hostess as part of my

02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:44.100
husband's work. And it's always difficult when a group of new friends meet together for the first

02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:47.860
time to get acquainted. So I'm perfectly prepared to start the ball rolling. I mean, I have

02:32:47.860 --> 02:32:52.180
absolutely no idea what I'm doing here, what we're doing here, what this place is about, but I am

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:56.580
determined to enjoy myself and I'm very intrigued and oh my, the soup's delicious, isn't it?

02:32:57.860 --> 02:33:01.060
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Have a wonderful night,

02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:05.380
everybody. We will see you in seven days time. Take care. Good night.
