WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.160
Finally, Sony has come back to the mobile space.

00:15.160 --> 00:22.680
Wi-Fi only, as long as you have a PS5 already, a $200 accessory for a $400 or $500 console.

00:22.680 --> 00:26.840
Hope your home internet is good and the Wi-Fi out wherever you are as well.

00:26.840 --> 00:27.840
Not promising.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.200
I made it back in time not to record in the closet again.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.320
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:33.320 --> 00:36.280
this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:36.280 --> 00:37.760
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.960
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:41.960 --> 00:46.160
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.160 --> 00:54.240
It is Orange Lounge Radio back and live once again tonight, August the 27th of 2023 with

00:54.240 --> 00:57.840
episode number 972 of our show.

00:57.840 --> 01:02.120
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week joined by my co-hosts.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.680
First off over there, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
Hello.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Hello.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
Hello.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
How are you doing?

01:09.680 --> 01:11.680
I'm all right.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.660
It's been a very trying week and I have to go right back to it tomorrow.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.520
Would you say based on your background that the last Metroid is in captivity and the galaxy

01:20.520 --> 01:21.520
is at peace?

01:21.520 --> 01:24.400
No, the galaxy is very much at war in my head.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.640
I'm sorry to hear that, but I hope we can have a fun show tonight to help with some

01:28.640 --> 01:31.640
of the sads or frustrations.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.160
I didn't say anything was sad, it's just long.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.760
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.320
Hey, Loki.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
Hello.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.320
And you've had quite the interesting weekend, haven't you?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.200
Yeah, it's been busy.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
Yeah.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
Busy week.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
Hectic week.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.560
You had a lot of prep stuff that was going into this week, didn't it?

01:50.600 --> 01:51.600
Didn't you?

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
There's been a lot.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.600
Yeah.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.600
Yeah.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.760
So you participated in this very large competition in the Minecraft community that we've been

01:59.760 --> 02:02.000
hyping for a couple of weeks here, right?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yes.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.880
MC Championship Rising 2.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.620
So it was fun.

02:08.620 --> 02:13.800
We did it yesterday for like three hours or so and it went by in a flash.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.500
Those three hours just gone.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.600
That's usually how it goes.

02:19.560 --> 02:25.000
I guess the most similar thing I can think of is doing like a live performance like Rocky

02:25.000 --> 02:26.540
Horror Shadowcasting or Clue Shadowcasting.

02:26.540 --> 02:30.880
You put all this work into it and then in two hours, it's done.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
It's done with.

02:31.880 --> 02:35.720
But how did things go for you and the team?

02:35.720 --> 02:36.720
It went okay.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.520
That is what I thought it was going to be.

02:38.520 --> 02:43.200
So like, I mean, you have to understand, like, this is a type of a competition that a lot

02:43.200 --> 02:49.280
of it is based off of, like, you know, PvP, parkour, that type of stuff.

02:49.280 --> 02:54.040
There's certainly a lot of creators that that's the kind of their centric type of content

02:54.040 --> 03:01.760
that they make that, you know, it's not so much SMP content and all that, which that's

03:01.760 --> 03:07.040
not to say that I don't I think actually the team at one is a little bit more SMP contents

03:07.040 --> 03:09.000
centric, if I remember correctly.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.680
I don't remember exactly.

03:10.680 --> 03:15.480
But but yeah, I mean, like, I didn't think I was going to come in there all of a sudden

03:15.480 --> 03:20.560
like, yes, in a week, I'm going to become an expert at PvP and parkour like that.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.680
I just knew that that was not going to happen.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.000
So we did okay.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.280
We didn't come in last.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
So that was good.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.800
We got ninth ninth place out of ten teams, which is fine.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.800
And we I got thirty fifth overall.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.580
So it was all right.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.800
There's a few opportunities that were kind of frustrating that like I had some pretty

03:39.800 --> 03:43.120
good runs, especially an ace race.

03:43.120 --> 03:48.180
The last lap, I got stuck on something in the last five positions on that.

03:48.180 --> 03:53.440
And like actually the and for those watching live, you can see it playing in the background.

03:53.440 --> 03:57.960
This is actually from the live stream that we did yesterday.

03:57.960 --> 04:03.680
And so there was, you know, some opportunities that, you know, I wish I had done better,

04:03.680 --> 04:07.560
but like, I don't know, it was still fun overall.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.680
Wish we could have played some games that we didn't.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.600
But you know, just the nature of the game.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.720
Oh, so like you only get so oh, I thought it was like an Olympics thing and you played

04:17.720 --> 04:18.720
them all.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.720
You only do you.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.120
Well, you get there's 14.

04:21.120 --> 04:27.080
So this the twist this time was so normally in MCC, they announced nine games and they

04:27.080 --> 04:30.640
play eight of them and one gets skipped in this one.

04:30.640 --> 04:35.800
They announced that all 14 games were going to be available and we'd only play eight of

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
them.

04:36.800 --> 04:42.920
So they kept introducing a new game every round once a game was picked.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.120
And so we didn't get to play everything.

04:45.120 --> 04:49.000
I wanted to play bingo but fast, but we didn't get to do that.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.540
Instead, we played battle box, which I wish we had skipped that because that's something

04:54.540 --> 04:56.460
that's on MCC Island.

04:56.460 --> 05:00.540
You can play that literally any time for free.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.840
So it's kind of lame that we played it, but whatever.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.840
It's fine.

05:04.840 --> 05:10.060
GP centric teams wanted to play that same with survival games.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.120
There was a funny thing with red.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.760
So like in the way the games are picked.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.600
So there's a thing called the decision dome.

05:17.600 --> 05:22.320
And it's this giant dome that basically it looks like a pie.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.640
And there's a bunch of different slices for each game.

05:24.640 --> 05:29.280
And you have an egg and you throw your chicken into where you want to go.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.620
And well, it's a Minecraft chicken.

05:30.620 --> 05:34.440
It doesn't necessarily want to listen to what you want it to do.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.440
So you can throw the egg and it may just walk somewhere else.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.720
But then there's also modifiers that you can get as well.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.520
So you can you can dunk other teams so that they can't throw their eggs.

05:45.520 --> 05:52.880
You can get a thing where you can fire an arrow and it will put you down there as a

05:52.880 --> 05:55.100
player and you get to knock the chickens around.

05:55.100 --> 05:59.160
And so the red team got that and they did that and they weren't paying attention to

05:59.160 --> 06:02.680
where they were knocking the chickens because they were trying to get them to go into bingo

06:02.680 --> 06:03.680
but fast.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.520
But then they accidentally put them all into survival games.

06:07.520 --> 06:12.480
It was a moment like it was funny, though, because because I was like joking about it,

06:12.480 --> 06:14.880
I'm like, oh, you're dead to me.

06:14.880 --> 06:21.040
And you could hear it right when they did that, like, I think I made a mistake.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.280
So that was kind of a funny, funny bit.

06:23.280 --> 06:28.520
OK, so it sounds like in light of the fact that like, OK, you don't have as much PvP

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
experience.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
Oh, sure.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.320
You were never going to get first place in this thing.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.680
And so you ended up with, you know, ninth or whatever, 35th.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.720
Like it really does sound like you had a lot of fun doing it and you have some great fun.

06:40.720 --> 06:45.240
It was got some really good networking and it sounds like to so yeah, yeah.

06:45.240 --> 06:49.520
So like the discord that we were all in, you know, it's going to stick around.

06:49.520 --> 06:54.400
We like already like talking about like, oh, hey, we need to do other things together and

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
stuff like that.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.800
Yeah, that'd be fun.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
So important.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
Yeah.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
So hopefully we get to do that.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.240
That would be great.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.720
So everyone's been really positive.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.720
I mean, sure.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.160
You want to do better, obviously.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.160
And there's like parts.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.440
It's like, say, oh, man, like, I really wish, you know, I'd done better here or I didn't

07:11.440 --> 07:12.440
do that.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.440
Yeah.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.440
Yeah.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.640
So you're just I'm just going to do that to myself because that's just what happens.

07:16.640 --> 07:21.000
And really, it's not so much that like I cared about like winning or anything.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.380
It's more of the attention to the channel.

07:23.380 --> 07:28.040
So like, I get it like beforehand already.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.420
People don't know who I am.

07:29.420 --> 07:31.740
And so they're like, oh, this person's an MCZ.

07:31.740 --> 07:32.920
Oh, that's cool.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.580
But then once the game's over, it's like, they don't really care about the teams that

07:36.580 --> 07:41.720
came in like, you know, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, you know, they don't care about them.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.440
They're only concerned about the people who want good sports.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.500
It's basically sports for, you know, Minecraft reality TV show.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
Yeah.

07:50.220 --> 07:55.040
So people that like, you know, that are like, oh, they train to like, guess who's going

07:55.040 --> 07:59.220
to win and and like care, really care about the stats and stuff like that.

07:59.220 --> 08:01.620
They're only going to be concerned about those top teams.

08:01.620 --> 08:05.620
And so then once again, it's just like, you know, here I'm in this space again, even though

08:05.620 --> 08:10.660
this is like a really prestigious thing, nobody is going to see my stuff like it's just back

08:10.660 --> 08:13.180
into the same thing against the struggle that you're in.

08:13.180 --> 08:16.300
But I mean, like, it's fine.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.300
It is what it is.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.780
We got like, I still got like 70 new subscribers.

08:20.780 --> 08:23.260
So I mean, that's something and then it's not nothing.

08:23.260 --> 08:27.140
It's yeah, the networking, it's, it's still going to be great for you.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.740
It's you know, you know, just because you didn't win American Idol doesn't mean you

08:31.740 --> 08:35.900
can't, you know, in the future be, you know, a Jennifer Hudson, it just takes a lot of

08:35.900 --> 08:36.900
work.

08:36.900 --> 08:37.900
Exactly.

08:37.900 --> 08:42.500
But yeah, I'm just I'm laughing in my head now.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.740
I said reality show because I'm like, you were on like a gaming reality show this weekend.

08:46.740 --> 08:47.740
Really you were on the tinder.

08:47.740 --> 08:49.780
Yeah, you're on the tester and you didn't win.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.780
I'm sorry to say.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.940
I mean, it's fine.

08:51.940 --> 08:56.300
I knew we we knew we weren't gonna win and the team that won was really awesome.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.620
Like they were all really awesome.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.860
But like the in particular, the one that won, I think is very deserving because they were

09:01.860 --> 09:04.560
like kind of underdogs as well.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.720
And they really put in the work to like get better winning.

09:08.720 --> 09:13.620
Is it just like all that famous fortune like you were talking about before in Minecraft

09:13.620 --> 09:14.620
coins fortune?

09:14.620 --> 09:18.700
Well, they get they get a commemorative coin shipped to them.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.980
So they get that.

09:20.980 --> 09:24.620
And I think the opportunity to be in the Canon events as well.

09:24.620 --> 09:29.540
I'm not sure if it's like a given in it's not even necessarily everybody that wins,

09:29.540 --> 09:33.660
but like some people that participate in it, you have an opportunity to maybe be invited

09:33.660 --> 09:39.020
back or like maybe you get your name in there because I know like Jojo was one that she

09:39.020 --> 09:42.220
was in the first MCC and their team won.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.900
And she's now a Canon player as well.

09:43.900 --> 09:47.540
In fact, she was one of the trainers that was in rising two.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.200
So if there's some people that will go through that process, I mean, they're certainly they're

09:51.200 --> 09:54.940
not always inviting necessarily new people all the time.

09:54.940 --> 10:00.900
And it wasn't necessarily all small creators like Yogscast was in there, which they're

10:00.900 --> 10:04.620
like super old in the Minecraft community.

10:04.620 --> 10:05.740
They've been around forever.

10:05.740 --> 10:10.600
So and that's like a group of like 30 some people I don't remember, but like four of

10:10.600 --> 10:11.600
them were there.

10:11.600 --> 10:15.160
Speaking of old, were you the oldest one in the competition?

10:15.160 --> 10:20.140
I was not and the reason for that is because OK, so here's here's what happened.

10:20.140 --> 10:22.440
So there was some drama during the week.

10:22.440 --> 10:29.200
So originally I was going to be the oldest person playing, but the Aqua Aqua team, I

10:29.200 --> 10:31.560
think it was Aqua team.

10:31.560 --> 10:39.640
They had a player that I don't want to go into details, but basically she had some IRL

10:39.640 --> 10:46.300
stuff that was not kosher that she was doing, interacting with fans and whatnot.

10:46.300 --> 10:52.960
And so they dropped the team, found out about it, her teammates found out about it and brought

10:52.960 --> 10:58.480
it to knock screw the folks running and said, listen, we don't feel right participating

10:58.480 --> 11:01.560
because of this, you know, ridiculous.

11:01.560 --> 11:08.660
So so they they said we would like to be subbed out or, you know, we it's not we don't want

11:08.660 --> 11:10.080
to give this person a platform.

11:10.080 --> 11:16.500
So they decided to drop out, which is very admirable.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.500
Just inappropriate conversations with underage.

11:19.500 --> 11:24.620
Oh, well, then, yeah, then that's like showing her boobs or something.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.880
No, no, no, no, no.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.880
It's nothing like that.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.060
It was no, it's more of she's young, but like, I don't want to go into it, but I don't even

11:31.060 --> 11:32.060
know the details.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.060
It doesn't matter.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.060
Stay out of the drama deep end.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.060
Yeah.

11:36.060 --> 11:41.180
No, but I wanted to know if it was something I wouldn't get.

11:41.180 --> 11:44.620
No, no, no, no, absolutely.

11:44.620 --> 11:51.500
So instead, so the new team got subbed in and that the guy in there, Richard, who's

11:51.500 --> 11:54.980
a guy from Australia, I think, and he makes music and whatnot.

11:54.980 --> 11:55.980
He's slightly older than me.

11:55.980 --> 11:56.980
He's 43.

11:56.980 --> 11:59.900
So like, he is technically now the oldest in there.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.300
I was like the second oldest now.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.300
So that's fine.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.300
That's fine.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.700
And their team did pretty good, too.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.340
They're fun.

12:06.340 --> 12:11.140
I got to play with them quite a bit, like practicing and whatnot.

12:11.140 --> 12:15.340
So yeah, I wasn't the oldest, but no, it was fun.

12:15.340 --> 12:18.020
We got to I got to train.

12:18.020 --> 12:23.720
Well, we had a meeting with Cubfan135 from Hermitcraft.

12:23.720 --> 12:28.580
So he was he decided I got him to coach us one day.

12:28.580 --> 12:32.940
So that was exciting getting to talk to him.

12:32.940 --> 12:36.660
And so now we're we're in touch now.

12:36.660 --> 12:41.300
And he was even in my like, which sucks because my replay right now, my VOD doesn't have the

12:41.300 --> 12:45.360
chat yet because YouTube is slow.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.620
But he was in chat, too.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.540
He like is wishing me good luck and stuff.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.380
So I thought that was just amazing.

12:50.380 --> 12:53.580
It's like died right there.

12:53.580 --> 12:54.580
So yeah, cool.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.500
So I've talked to two hermits now.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.800
So we get to get to see them eventually, all of them.

12:59.800 --> 13:04.540
And that was something that wouldn't have happened if this hadn't all, you know, happened.

13:04.540 --> 13:09.000
So I'm just you know, I know you're you certainly are glad that you did the experience and everything

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
like that.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.920
But there's lots to win besides the gold medal.

13:11.920 --> 13:15.280
In fact, going to our chat room because I have yet to mention we do tape live every

13:15.280 --> 13:18.760
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of Geeks Network,

13:18.760 --> 13:23.700
twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although Bobby Black

13:23.700 --> 13:27.860
Wolf did not end up being live tonight, but he will be back in two weeks after Dragon

13:27.860 --> 13:30.160
Khan and looks forward to chatting with you all then.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.900
So he'll be back in two weeks.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.400
And we will not be here next week as well.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.640
But I will tap into that in just a little bit.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.260
But in their chat room as we tape live over twitch.tv slash VOG network, as to 100 Matt

13:41.260 --> 13:45.300
says, the main thing is Loki, you may not have one, but you're part of a much larger

13:45.300 --> 13:46.300
community.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.980
Now, you're getting more and more known, which is a huge step for when you started this journey

13:49.980 --> 13:50.980
a bit ago.

13:50.980 --> 13:53.100
I'm on tier lists now.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.100
That's kind of funny.

13:54.100 --> 14:00.340
Now, granted, like, yeah, I'm on a Minecraft tier list now, Minecraft content creator.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.340
Loki is like this.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.340
It's like this.

14:02.340 --> 14:08.740
Imagine you're on this very large network of independent internet radio stations.

14:08.740 --> 14:13.820
And you get nominated for an award that you're the best one of the year.

14:13.820 --> 14:17.180
And then you actually travel to the ceremony in person.

14:17.180 --> 14:22.620
And then they not only you not only didn't win, but they didn't even read your fucking

14:22.620 --> 14:28.260
name on the envelope until one of your co hosts, the audience said, Hey, so loudly,

14:28.260 --> 14:34.740
it was picked up on the internet broadcast and the person hosting said, Oh, yeah, and

14:34.740 --> 14:40.780
these guys to imagine that and think about what a great thing it is to be part of that

14:40.780 --> 14:42.300
much larger community.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.340
It doesn't matter that we are these people did win.

14:46.340 --> 14:51.140
It matters that we became a part of that community, which fell apart three years later.

14:52.140 --> 14:53.620
I mean, yeah, it's fine.

14:53.620 --> 14:57.420
Like, I think it's funny, though, because like all the like, the tier list stuff that's

14:57.420 --> 15:01.020
been coming out now, it's like most of it's just like, I don't know who this person is.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.340
I'm like, that's fine.

15:02.340 --> 15:03.820
I'm like, I just like being on the tier.

15:03.820 --> 15:08.900
I like that my name and my my thumbnail or my profile pic is on the tier list at all.

15:08.900 --> 15:12.940
So they're still talking about you, whether it's good, whether I've got a wiki page out

15:12.940 --> 15:13.940
on the internet.

15:13.940 --> 15:16.340
Now, I'm on the MCC wiki page now.

15:16.340 --> 15:20.180
So like that, that's the thing now, you know, that that happened.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.620
Does it does it link to the OLR wiki so we can wiki the wiki?

15:24.740 --> 15:28.620
I doesn't, but wiki, wiki whack.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.180
That is wiki, wiki whack.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.380
The most dad joke I've told on this show in like three years.

15:36.660 --> 15:43.940
Oh, gosh, like I Yeah, so like, because I knew it was going to be kind of a struggle like to

15:43.940 --> 15:46.660
like, we weren't gonna be doing well, I was trying to be as entertaining as possible.

15:46.660 --> 15:52.820
So like, I had like prepared bits for, you know, while we played and stuff like that.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.780
I know you did make me proud.

15:55.300 --> 16:04.220
So so like, for example, during Sands of Time, I was sharing facts about sand during Sands of

16:04.220 --> 16:05.220
Time, which is fun.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.780
And it's just a very extra thing to do.

16:07.780 --> 16:08.260
I love it.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.540
And then what else?

16:10.540 --> 16:19.260
Oh, before Ace Race, I was incorrectly quoting Dom from Fast and the Furious, mixing in some of

16:19.260 --> 16:24.580
his quotes and also fast food slogans with that, which I thought was ridiculous.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.020
But I did it anyways.

16:26.580 --> 16:27.660
I don't know, it was fun.

16:27.900 --> 16:31.260
Well, I want to make sure we have time to get into the news tonight and all that good stuff as

16:31.260 --> 16:31.460
well.

16:31.460 --> 16:35.700
But you know, congrats, congrats from all of us here, not just at OLR, but the voice geeks network,

16:35.740 --> 16:40.500
you know, I know it was a very visible, very high profile thing for you to do.

16:40.500 --> 16:45.900
And I'm glad you not only did it, but you you you poured yourself into it.

16:45.900 --> 16:50.220
And I hope those kiddos and I can say that because you were almost almost the oldest one of the

16:50.220 --> 16:50.580
competition.

16:50.740 --> 16:56.300
I hope those kiddos know just how much of yourself you poured into that competition and really,

16:56.300 --> 16:58.060
really took it to heart and had fun with it.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.620
So congrats.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.500
You made us proud, Loki.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.700
Thank you.

17:03.900 --> 17:04.540
You're welcome.

17:04.540 --> 17:08.100
All right, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.940
There's been a lot going on in the gaming world.

17:09.980 --> 17:15.740
Of course, with Gamescom this last weekend, we've had a bit of news come out of that.

17:15.740 --> 17:16.900
So we're going to get into that.

17:17.100 --> 17:20.940
I will also quickly mention here I know I've been saying it for a few weeks here on the show.

17:21.500 --> 17:27.100
We collectively will not be here live next week with Orange Launch Radio as I will be off at

17:27.100 --> 17:31.140
Dragon Con with Bobby Blackwell also from the voice geeks network.

17:31.740 --> 17:36.060
We actually did a whole little pre special if you want to hear more about Dragon Con in depth.

17:36.460 --> 17:43.780
That is over on our YouTube archive over at VOG Network on YouTube and even our first TikTok.

17:43.780 --> 17:48.180
We did a minute and a half version of our most looking forward to things for Dragon Con that is

17:48.180 --> 17:51.420
available as well over TikTok at VOG Network for the very first time.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.180
So very excited for Dragon Con.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.660
But that means there will be no show this next weekend.

17:56.540 --> 18:01.220
However, Dark Soccer, I know you're going to be doing your thing next Saturday, next Saturday,

18:01.220 --> 18:03.820
next Sunday, well, maybe Saturday and Sunday, but next Sunday for sure, right?

18:04.980 --> 18:07.460
Yeah, well, I'm back on my regular work schedule.

18:07.860 --> 18:12.140
So I will be doing a at least 12 hour subathon.

18:13.660 --> 18:19.420
Like, and I'm like, for if I get like a follow, I'll add like a minute.

18:19.420 --> 18:22.340
And if I get a sub, I'll add like five minutes or something.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.420
So we'll see how long I go.

18:24.420 --> 18:28.820
Because since I'll be back on my normal schedule, I will not have to get up early on Monday.

18:29.460 --> 18:33.220
So, yeah, I think it would be a fun thing to do anyway.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.620
Hopefully with Labor Day weekend, that means more people can tune in, too.

18:36.620 --> 18:40.060
Although I might also mean people out of town, but hopefully it all works out.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.140
So. All right.

18:42.780 --> 18:45.620
Loki, Loki, are you doing anything online next weekend?

18:45.620 --> 18:49.220
Are you taking you get to have a nice, quiet night with Mrs.

18:49.220 --> 18:52.620
Loki? I may I may try to stream.

18:52.620 --> 18:56.660
I don't know. It depends on where I'm at with editing, because I'm still editing my finale,

18:56.660 --> 18:58.980
which is taking me three weeks so far.

18:59.620 --> 19:04.300
So I made it a point that I don't want to play back on because I did.

19:04.420 --> 19:08.420
I mean, without getting into my game week, I did play in our season three server,

19:08.420 --> 19:13.260
but I don't want to get too far into it because I don't want to have like two episodes

19:13.260 --> 19:15.020
in process at the same time.

19:15.020 --> 19:19.340
I want to finish one and then go and start the next one.

19:19.340 --> 19:23.140
So I'm forcing myself to edit until it's done.

19:23.140 --> 19:24.620
I'm not playing on the server.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.860
So hopefully I'll be done by then.

19:27.140 --> 19:29.820
And then I will be able to play and then maybe live stream from there.

19:29.820 --> 19:34.300
But I do want to live stream more for sure on Twitch

19:34.660 --> 19:39.180
instead of YouTube, because the viewership seems to be better there.

19:39.180 --> 19:43.420
And originally my plan was because of, you know, YouTube.

19:43.420 --> 19:46.140
I thought, you know, it'd be easier for subscribers and stuff.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.380
That doesn't seem to be the case.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.940
So discoverability seems to be better on Twitch.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.020
So we're going to go back there again.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.180
Give that a try because we're affiliate anyway.

19:53.180 --> 19:55.460
So I mean, why not? Why not?

19:55.460 --> 19:58.860
All right. Well, that's all what's going on next weekend.

19:58.860 --> 20:03.180
And then OLR, we will collectively be back in two weeks from tonight.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.740
And of course, on the podcast feed and all that good stuff as well.

20:05.940 --> 20:09.460
That will be Sunday, September 10th that we will be back.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.380
No show on September 3rd.

20:11.380 --> 20:15.980
OK, let's get into so I mentioned Gamescom happened this week,

20:15.980 --> 20:18.020
but there was some news earlier in the week

20:18.020 --> 20:22.700
that really had a lot of people kind of taken by surprise and cut.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.860
Well, I don't know about surprise,

20:23.860 --> 20:27.220
but definitely, definitely a lot of people talking on social this week.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.940
Loki, you want to share with us the big news that came down

20:30.940 --> 20:32.780
from Nintendo this week?

20:32.780 --> 20:36.060
Yeah. So Nintendo basically said that, hey, you know what?

20:37.060 --> 20:39.260
I hope you like Chris Pratt do the voice of Mario.

20:39.620 --> 20:40.860
That's all they said.

20:40.860 --> 20:44.220
But they did say that Charles Martinet has, you know, stepped down

20:44.220 --> 20:48.300
from the voice of Mario that, you know, while it's been honored

20:48.300 --> 20:50.980
to work with him, you know, he is no longer going to be doing it.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.820
Didn't say who else is going to be taking over for Mario, but

20:54.900 --> 20:57.100
know that it is not Charles Martinet.

20:57.100 --> 21:01.860
That probably also makes sense why the new trailer for the new Mario game

21:01.860 --> 21:04.540
didn't quite sound the same.

21:04.540 --> 21:06.700
So it's probably a new voice actor.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.980
I'd be curious to see who is doing it.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.380
I'm actually kind of glad they didn't say who it was going to be,

21:11.380 --> 21:13.700
because if they said who it was going to be the same day

21:13.700 --> 21:15.820
they announced this news, that person would have gotten bullied.

21:15.820 --> 21:17.980
Like, yeah, it sucks.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.980
But that's just true facts like that.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.300
And it's not like it would happen.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.940
I don't think it's that they fired him or anything like that.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.420
It's probably his choice.

21:25.420 --> 21:26.980
He probably just can't.

21:26.980 --> 21:28.500
Maybe he can't do the voice anymore.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.540
Just doesn't want to.

21:29.540 --> 21:30.500
We don't know.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.580
And that's what this all boils down to.

21:32.580 --> 21:33.340
We don't know.

21:33.340 --> 21:36.460
And we're not going to know because people look, I'll just say people

21:36.460 --> 21:39.180
would be quick to bring up that a couple of years ago,

21:39.180 --> 21:42.780
Charles Martinet in an interview said, I want I want to do this till I die.

21:42.780 --> 21:44.260
Or I would do this until OK.

21:44.260 --> 21:47.980
Well, I guess a lot can change in two years.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.740
A lot can change in two years.

21:49.740 --> 21:50.380
You know what I mean?

21:50.380 --> 21:51.260
And we don't know.

21:51.260 --> 21:55.700
Like, it's not it's not up for us to pry into his personal life

21:55.700 --> 21:56.660
to try to find out.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.500
Like, we just know this is what it is.

21:58.500 --> 22:03.020
You can kind of infer that based on his new role

22:03.020 --> 22:06.460
of being the ambassador or whatever, what did they call it?

22:06.700 --> 22:07.540
The Mario Ambassador?

22:07.540 --> 22:11.020
He is going to be the Mario ambassador.

22:11.020 --> 22:11.540
Yeah.

22:11.540 --> 22:15.420
So you can infer through that that relations are still good, right?

22:15.420 --> 22:17.220
Because it wasn't.

22:17.220 --> 22:19.980
Well, fuck you. I quit then type is not that I would ever think.

22:20.100 --> 22:20.940
But it wasn't.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.340
I mean, there are certainly people in this world that if they were told

22:24.340 --> 22:26.700
you're no longer going to be able to do the voice, they would say, all right,

22:26.900 --> 22:28.740
give me give me my last paycheck.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.340
I'm fucking out of here type of thing, right?

22:30.340 --> 22:32.380
But that's that's not what happened here.

22:32.380 --> 22:36.140
So there is a little bit of a, you know, OK, you know, Mr.

22:36.140 --> 22:41.180
Martinet is still working with Nintendo in these ambassadorships.

22:41.420 --> 22:45.540
It also allows him to continue what is probably his bread and butter

22:45.540 --> 22:49.420
of income at this point, which is making appearances at Fan Expo,

22:49.700 --> 22:53.940
doing the panels to give his good old hearted wahoos and recording bumpers

22:54.140 --> 22:58.340
for podcasts like what on this network and all of that.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.420
Like, no shade.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.020
That is literally what, you know, he does.

23:02.020 --> 23:04.860
And, you know, make some money from those convention appearances

23:04.860 --> 23:06.780
and autographs, the selfies and all of that.

23:06.780 --> 23:11.060
And it allows him to still carry that official capacity

23:11.060 --> 23:13.620
is of Mark because he's the ambassador for Mario or whatever.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.020
And still allows him to do that.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.700
So it's it's still a nice win situation for him.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.500
Tiger Klom chat points out

23:20.500 --> 23:24.740
Charles Martinet has been involved in Nintendo projects from 1996 to 2023.

23:25.020 --> 23:28.580
I count 2023 because of his role in the Super Mario Brothers movie. Yes.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.780
And honestly, and I think we can talk about this now.

23:31.780 --> 23:34.700
Now that the Mario Brothers movie is on video, I think if you were going

23:34.700 --> 23:38.100
to be worried about spoilers, we're kind of past that point.

23:38.340 --> 23:42.500
So I think the fact that he did get to play their dad,

23:42.620 --> 23:47.220
which, by the way, I called on this show when they first announced him as a guest.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.020
I just want to point that out.

23:49.020 --> 23:52.500
I was trying very hard not to spoil it by doing the nana nana nana.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.100
I'm right. He also did another voice, right?

23:55.100 --> 23:59.060
Wasn't he the guy playing the music in the arcade, playing the arcade machine?

23:59.220 --> 24:01.300
I don't remember his name is in there.

24:01.300 --> 24:04.500
So but my point is that was a very nice

24:04.820 --> 24:09.180
legacy role for him, you know, like like you're Mario's dad.

24:09.180 --> 24:12.940
It's like a literal kind of like passing of the baton of swords.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.500
And I thought that was really cool.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.740
And he did a great job with the roles in the movie.

24:16.740 --> 24:18.340
And yeah, so he got to be in the movie.

24:18.340 --> 24:22.140
The other Mario and having just done a panel

24:22.140 --> 24:25.580
like a month ago with some of the other voice actors and actresses in the game.

24:25.860 --> 24:28.020
Unfortunately, none of them were in the movie.

24:28.020 --> 24:32.780
So it really goes to show like Charles Martinet and his tie

24:32.780 --> 24:35.660
to the franchise and everything, that the fact that, you know,

24:35.660 --> 24:38.580
he was able to stand in lockstep with

24:39.220 --> 24:41.860
A and B list Hollywood celebrities that made up the rest of the cast.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.580
Tyra Conchat says best wishes for the new Mario voice actor.

24:45.580 --> 24:46.940
He has big shoes to fill. Yeah.

24:46.940 --> 24:50.540
And I, I really feel sorry for this person because the moment it's announced,

24:50.540 --> 24:52.500
people are going to hate him from the outset.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.620
And I really wish people wouldn't do that.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.540
Like this is this is just a decision that's been made.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.180
Why did they make the decision though?

24:59.180 --> 25:01.780
Here's my here's my honest to God thinking.

25:01.980 --> 25:05.300
And people are probably going to take issue with me saying this.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.740
I'm sorry, but I'm just I'm going to just say this.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.700
It's like I'm telling you like it is.

25:10.460 --> 25:15.180
My thought is now that the movie has kind of happened,

25:15.860 --> 25:20.260
the wall to Mario doing dialogue has kind of been breached.

25:20.260 --> 25:24.300
And the reason why I say kind of is that Captain Lou breached this wall

25:24.300 --> 25:27.300
a long time ago and others and not just Captain Lou, but others before.

25:27.340 --> 25:29.860
There's been actually many voices of Mario, you know, from.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.500
There's also the anime movie.

25:31.500 --> 25:35.460
Yeah, anime, the Super Saturday arcade, when Peter Cullen did and all this.

25:35.460 --> 25:37.500
There's there's lots of people that have done this.

25:37.500 --> 25:41.980
But for many, many years and let's be honest,

25:41.980 --> 25:45.020
for most people in their 20s and young 30s,

25:45.620 --> 25:48.580
they haven't heard a lot of voice acted Mario beyond the

25:48.740 --> 25:51.660
wahoo wahoo in all the stuff that Charles Martinet did.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.860
And I think what's happening is that I don't know

25:55.860 --> 25:59.580
if it's going to happen in Super Mario Wonder, but in a future Mario game,

25:59.580 --> 26:02.420
we're probably getting full Mario voice acting.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.020
And they're going to look to that Mario voice acting

26:06.420 --> 26:10.540
to line up a little more with what we saw of Mario in the movie.

26:11.060 --> 26:14.780
A little bit of the stereotypical Italian accent,

26:15.180 --> 26:21.220
but maybe not that full energy, that full 11 the Charles Martinet did,

26:21.580 --> 26:24.180
because, you know, a lot of people have suggested that

26:24.780 --> 26:28.580
two hours of Charles Martinet doing his high energy Mario

26:28.860 --> 26:31.620
probably wouldn't have been as.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.980
Wonderful to hear, as people think,

26:35.620 --> 26:38.460
and that's no shade to a very hard working man

26:38.460 --> 26:40.580
who I really respect a lot in this industry.

26:40.580 --> 26:44.100
It's just artistically, is it the right fit?

26:44.300 --> 26:48.580
And sometimes we have to admit the answer is no, maybe.

26:49.180 --> 26:51.740
So I that's my thought.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.820
That's my thought for how this, you know, again,

26:53.820 --> 26:57.620
I don't know, I'm just some schmo with a podcast, but my thought is

26:58.100 --> 27:02.860
whether it's in Wonder or it's on the successor console to the Nintendo Switch,

27:03.060 --> 27:07.020
we're going to get a fully or more fully voice acted Mario game.

27:07.380 --> 27:10.060
And they want somebody whose voice is a little more in line

27:10.060 --> 27:12.940
with what was in the movie, not Chris Pratt, though.

27:13.220 --> 27:15.380
Obviously, he's the guy from Final Fantasy 16.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.220
He's too expensive.

27:17.380 --> 27:18.660
Now, that was funny.

27:18.660 --> 27:23.100
But it got to I can't believe how many websites

27:23.100 --> 27:27.940
get their fucking clicks from the voice actor for Clive wants to be the voice

27:27.940 --> 27:30.940
of Mario. It was it was a stupid fucking joke.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.220
It was a stupid fucking.

27:32.220 --> 27:36.420
And I say that in the nicest possible way as somebody who really loves Ben Starr.

27:36.420 --> 27:40.780
I mean, really, I really, really have a crush on that guy.

27:40.780 --> 27:43.100
He's so hot.

27:43.580 --> 27:48.300
I can't listen. Listen, I'm 100 percent straight, but he he's pretty hot.

27:48.620 --> 27:49.780
Thank you. Thank you.

27:49.780 --> 27:53.060
Like, it's a OK to be a little gay for Ben Starr.

27:53.060 --> 27:55.380
Like he or totally gay for it.

27:55.380 --> 27:57.420
He's totally, totally worthy of that.

27:57.420 --> 28:03.340
So my point is, it's really mind blowing to me how many people are like,

28:03.900 --> 28:05.700
oh, he's really going for the voice of Mario.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.940
No, he's not. He guess what?

28:07.940 --> 28:10.140
He knew it was a tweet that would get retweeted.

28:10.260 --> 28:11.580
And he was fucking right.

28:11.580 --> 28:14.820
And then he got other voice actors in on it, too.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.820
I don't know if he said then other people started.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.580
We haven't seen the other ones. No.

28:18.580 --> 28:21.500
Oh, Bobby retweeted one for one of the folks in Yakuza

28:22.980 --> 28:27.860
that that was doing it's it's the same joke, but it's funny.

28:27.860 --> 28:31.060
It's funny to see multiple people do it and like their characters voices.

28:31.060 --> 28:35.140
So anyway, no, it has not been star, unfortunately,

28:35.140 --> 28:38.500
but it is going to be somebody who it's it's going to be

28:38.740 --> 28:43.060
the made for TV version of Chris Pratt is the voice is going to be.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.900
Troy Baker, you think?

28:45.940 --> 28:47.620
I don't know. He's the voice of everybody.

28:47.620 --> 28:50.180
If I was my favorite voice, it's fine.

28:50.340 --> 28:53.260
What's that? What I think what I think it is in the end is

28:53.260 --> 28:55.140
that it's not any of our fucking business.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.220
It doesn't matter either.

28:56.220 --> 28:58.860
It's like, who cares? Like who the voice is? Yeah.

28:59.420 --> 29:02.780
I'm going to go in with an open mind if other people don't go into there.

29:02.820 --> 29:03.860
We'll screw them.

29:03.860 --> 29:06.460
And I hope the guys, the person coming into it has tough skin.

29:06.900 --> 29:11.460
But in the end, it doesn't matter because it's happened

29:11.460 --> 29:14.980
and there will be a replacement deal with it. Pixel shades.

29:15.620 --> 29:19.340
Just you need that for your little vtuber.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.580
He needs some pixel shades.

29:20.580 --> 29:22.180
I have some pixel shades.

29:22.180 --> 29:25.140
I have to make a new model to put them on her, but I have some pixel shades.

29:26.180 --> 29:27.260
No, but you you know what?

29:27.260 --> 29:30.460
You make a great point, honestly, because if you think about it,

29:30.900 --> 29:33.460
Charles Martinet was not always the voice of Mario.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.420
And before him, most notably Captain Lou.

29:36.660 --> 29:40.540
And a lot of us were of an age where Captain Lou was, you know,

29:40.700 --> 29:43.180
let's do the barber yoga.

29:43.220 --> 29:46.940
And I, by the way, in the movie, I love that they referenced that as well.

29:46.940 --> 29:48.020
That was the coolest thing.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.860
Actually, Captain Lou wasn't the first.

29:49.860 --> 29:52.940
No, no. And I know he wasn't the first, but which I said earlier.

29:52.940 --> 29:57.100
But, you know, my point is that when the voice changed

29:57.100 --> 30:01.660
from Captain Lou to Charles Martinet, that was a big change.

30:01.820 --> 30:03.180
But you know what?

30:03.180 --> 30:06.460
People really dug Charles Martinet at the end of the day.

30:06.740 --> 30:10.060
So whoever this new person is, give him a chance.

30:10.540 --> 30:15.140
And it doesn't take anything away from the awesome legacy

30:15.140 --> 30:16.580
that Charles Martinet has left.

30:16.580 --> 30:17.700
And you know what?

30:17.700 --> 30:21.300
If you love Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario,

30:22.060 --> 30:26.980
go to a convention he's appearing at, pay him for a selfie and tell him so.

30:27.820 --> 30:28.940
He'll appreciate that.

30:28.940 --> 30:30.260
And then it's a win.

30:30.260 --> 30:34.020
If you feel Charles Martinet should still

30:34.300 --> 30:37.180
be getting paid, then by all means, pay him.

30:38.180 --> 30:41.620
He is going to keep getting paid as the investor.

30:41.900 --> 30:42.780
That's right. That's right.

30:42.780 --> 30:44.380
He will still be getting paid for that role.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.700
So he's basically pulling a Miyamoto.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.060
What's the last game that Miyamoto actually programmed?

30:49.060 --> 30:50.780
Actually programmed?

30:50.780 --> 30:55.780
Oh, golly, I don't I feel like I heard he was in there

30:55.780 --> 30:59.620
assisting with something in the not too distant past.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.300
But yeah, not not from the ground up.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.380
I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.660
What modern programming languages does he know?

31:07.180 --> 31:11.580
Yeah, I mean, seriously.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.700
Yeah, I mean, back in.

31:13.700 --> 31:16.620
I'm just saying, you know, back in the day, I think that like.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.820
There was the big win in the 90s was,

31:21.820 --> 31:25.020
you know, C++ and all that, so, yeah.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.620
Well, in all these things,

31:27.620 --> 31:31.660
probably assembly languages of various sorts for the old carts and all that.

31:31.660 --> 31:34.580
So and now he's punch cards and they liked it.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.500
It was Fortran.

31:37.500 --> 31:42.180
No. Tiger Claw chat says they started adding a voice for Mario

31:42.180 --> 31:45.380
once the N64 came out due to its processing power.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.180
They were able to add some voiceovers.

31:47.180 --> 31:50.580
They didn't. Did you remember what I said earlier in the show?

31:50.940 --> 31:52.740
The last Metroid is in captivity.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.180
That was some Super Nintendo magic there.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.220
Of course, that probably took up half the cartridge right there,

31:58.220 --> 32:00.620
but you could do it hypothetically.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.380
Well, remember me talking about Star Ocean before?

32:04.380 --> 32:07.220
Sure. How much voice acting that had

32:08.500 --> 32:13.460
like a whole spoken introduction and voice acting on every battle level.

32:14.540 --> 32:18.860
And they had to expand the the memory in the cartridge.

32:19.780 --> 32:23.540
Well, if you want to go way, way back, go back to one of my favorite systems

32:23.540 --> 32:25.380
ever that I never shut up about here on the show.

32:25.380 --> 32:29.180
The Commodore 64 had some rad voice synth and it had games

32:29.180 --> 32:31.220
like Impossible Mission the very beginning.

32:31.260 --> 32:35.660
Another visitor stay a while, stay forever.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.980
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato?

32:38.980 --> 32:42.860
It is. What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?

32:45.300 --> 32:48.500
OK, but the Commodore 64 had a legendary voice because Ghostbusters

32:48.500 --> 32:52.860
actually had the in the very beginning when you would fire it up the Ghostbusters.

32:53.580 --> 32:56.140
Like it actually there was a lot of like voice stuff again.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.420
That was a computer from 1985.

32:58.420 --> 33:01.100
So we've we've had voice acting of sorts.

33:01.260 --> 33:03.460
For a long time. Look at Turtles in Time.

33:03.460 --> 33:06.060
You had a lot of voice acting.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.980
Oh, my God. I mean, it's just like listening

33:09.980 --> 33:13.740
to Mickey Mouse today versus, you know, 30 years ago. Mm hmm.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.620
It's a different voice.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.940
But it's still Mickey Mouse.

33:18.940 --> 33:21.300
Yep. You know, yep.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.860
Or as Dark Tatia brings up Street Fighter two.

33:24.860 --> 33:28.140
But I mean, think about the various iterations of the Street Fighter series

33:28.420 --> 33:31.020
and how many different voice actors you've had over the years.

33:31.300 --> 33:34.980
The view today is not the view from, you know, the late 80s.

33:35.860 --> 33:39.820
Or take it a step further to mocap in the neighbor Mortal Kombat.

33:39.900 --> 33:44.020
The person who mocapped Sonya back in the day is not still doing it today.

33:44.020 --> 33:47.900
So, you know, of course, there were a lot of there were a lot of other things

33:47.900 --> 33:51.060
at play with some changes between Mortal Kombat three and so forth.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.020
But you could do a whole other show about that.

33:53.020 --> 33:55.100
So anyway. All right.

33:55.980 --> 33:59.220
Well, best of luck to whoever you know, it's again,

33:59.220 --> 34:02.300
it's always kind of sad to see the changing of a guard.

34:02.300 --> 34:05.540
But I think it is like one of those things you have to go.

34:05.580 --> 34:08.100
This this happens artistically. It happens.

34:08.820 --> 34:11.700
And it's great that Charles Martinet will still be touring conventions

34:11.700 --> 34:16.260
and getting to do Mario in some capacity and allowing us to pay him

34:16.380 --> 34:19.060
while still also collecting a paycheck of sorts from Nintendo.

34:19.780 --> 34:23.420
And so I think we should all commit to not bullying the new person

34:24.260 --> 34:26.500
and just seeing what the new game has to offer.

34:26.700 --> 34:29.420
You know, and also the other thing, too, which is interesting.

34:29.420 --> 34:31.900
So he's not doing the voice of Mario.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.900
But what about all the other characters he does?

34:34.620 --> 34:36.020
No mention of that. That's true.

34:36.020 --> 34:37.020
No mention of Wario.

34:37.020 --> 34:40.380
Well, Wario and Waluigi are never coming back, I'm sorry to say.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.380
I'm kidding. But that's you ask a great question, though.

34:44.740 --> 34:47.500
Or Luigi or like all the other stuff. Yeah.

34:47.740 --> 34:50.180
Honestly, I think this is his way of saying retirement.

34:50.980 --> 34:54.700
That's that's kind of your your voice is an instrument.

34:54.940 --> 35:00.660
And on top of that, it's a a a series of muscles and nerves.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.100
And as I can tell you from my own experience,

35:03.580 --> 35:07.020
you know, doing stuff on phones and, you know, podcasting and streaming

35:07.020 --> 35:11.300
and everything for as long as I have your instrument will give out.

35:11.620 --> 35:16.900
Yeah, especially, you know, on in much older people.

35:17.780 --> 35:21.740
It's going to just have even less resilience than it used to.

35:22.100 --> 35:25.420
I would now I don't know how June four eight managed to do it

35:25.420 --> 35:28.300
as long as she did, but she's also magical and a goddess.

35:29.700 --> 35:33.740
But, you know, I think if this is retirement from voice

35:33.740 --> 35:36.300
acting, then he's he's more than deserved it.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.300
He's been doing this for a long time.

35:40.300 --> 35:46.220
And I hope that he enjoys his ambassadorship and resting his voice. Yeah.

35:47.380 --> 35:49.500
All right. Well, on that note, we're going to move on

35:49.500 --> 35:52.300
and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

35:52.300 --> 35:55.060
we've been playing this week, Mario games or otherwise.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.580
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

35:57.580 --> 35:59.420
It was pretty OK.

35:59.420 --> 36:04.020
I since my stream schedule is all thrown off from having to work

36:04.020 --> 36:07.340
in an eight by five and get up at five a.m.

36:07.340 --> 36:09.380
the freaking morning.

36:10.140 --> 36:13.420
I did play the new Cult of the Lamb DLC.

36:13.420 --> 36:17.340
It was like the Cult of the Lamb and don't starve crossover type thing.

36:17.620 --> 36:19.900
They just basically had a new

36:21.060 --> 36:23.380
a new cultist that you could add in.

36:23.380 --> 36:28.220
We're like, if you kill one of your one of your people in your cult,

36:29.060 --> 36:32.300
you're left with a skull and you bury their head in a grave.

36:32.300 --> 36:35.380
And then the spider creature crawls out.

36:35.380 --> 36:37.420
And he's just a normal person hanging around.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.580
But he's got spiders all around him.

36:39.580 --> 36:44.100
And there was like some decorative stuff that was really about it.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.860
You know, it was just the game as usual after that.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.900
I think it's still those cult of the lamb.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.380
I love it. And every time something new comes out, I'm going to play it.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.900
I'm trying to think, of course,

36:57.180 --> 37:00.700
I played some Disney Dreamlight Valley, which I love that game.

37:00.700 --> 37:03.500
I played some off stream just because it's such chill vibes.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.500
You know, that's like my cozy game.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.540
And then, of course, I played some Dead by Daylight,

37:10.620 --> 37:14.900
still working on those killer that some might do a little bit more

37:14.940 --> 37:18.180
off stream DVD.

37:18.180 --> 37:22.100
I think the last adapt I got was finally

37:22.340 --> 37:24.620
Pyramid Head after some struggle.

37:26.180 --> 37:29.740
And then, of course, I played Live Alive last night.

37:29.740 --> 37:33.980
I finished the ninja scenario, which was very complicated.

37:34.580 --> 37:38.780
Like you have to go into these rooms and go back to these rooms.

37:38.780 --> 37:41.980
You don't really have any clue on what you're supposed to do.

37:42.980 --> 37:47.020
And if it wasn't that I had like a like a semi walk through

37:47.020 --> 37:50.660
with sort of like a guide, I think I would have gotten very lost.

37:52.060 --> 37:58.180
So as it stands, I have the the robot to do cube

37:58.660 --> 38:01.740
and I have the

38:02.300 --> 38:05.940
the other guy, the karate guy.

38:05.940 --> 38:09.100
But it was the game is really good.

38:09.100 --> 38:14.300
I loved the whole story and music for the lesson area that I did.

38:14.700 --> 38:19.940
And I love that it's broken down into such digestible chapters is really.

38:20.460 --> 38:23.860
And the last one was very, you know, steeped in,

38:24.420 --> 38:28.300
you know, Japanese myth and, you know, combined with history.

38:28.300 --> 38:32.180
And one of your enemies, by the way, is a giant koi who.

38:32.580 --> 38:34.420
Yeah, I totally didn't fight the giant koi.

38:34.420 --> 38:37.300
He was too hard, but I put a picture up.

38:37.660 --> 38:41.300
But that's been it, I've been playing my word scapes

38:41.300 --> 38:44.780
and they're turning it way much more into a money gouge

38:44.780 --> 38:46.980
and I'm trying to tear myself away from it.

38:49.980 --> 38:54.700
Oh, oh, and I did play a little bit just on my own of panorama cotton.

38:55.180 --> 38:58.020
That game gives me kind of vertigo, but I also super love it.

38:58.020 --> 39:01.060
You remember Rainbow Cotton, right? Yeah.

39:01.060 --> 39:04.020
Panorama cotton style wise is its precursor.

39:04.220 --> 39:05.340
It was on the Genesis.

39:05.340 --> 39:07.660
They made the master system, I should say.

39:08.020 --> 39:10.180
They made like 600 copies.

39:10.980 --> 39:16.300
So, yeah, it is, however, now on the Switch eShop.

39:16.300 --> 39:19.420
So definitely a Genesis game worth playing.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.860
I think I've covered it before. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

39:23.380 --> 39:26.580
All right. Well, we'll go over to Loki and your gaming week.

39:26.580 --> 39:29.020
I feel like we probably covered a good chunk of the top.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.460
Yeah, we've talked about a lot of it. I'll defer anyway.

39:31.900 --> 39:37.620
It's been a lot of just Minecraft on the MCC practice server

39:37.620 --> 39:41.740
and, of course, on MCC Island as well.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.820
I played a little bit of that.

39:44.460 --> 39:47.980
Yeah, it was basically all a lot of practice during the week.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.580
We did take a break from practice to film

39:51.180 --> 39:55.340
a bingo thing just with the team members.

39:55.340 --> 39:58.180
So that's out now on Binish's channel.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.500
And we did that. That was fun.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.700
Our team won. Spoilers.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.420
But yeah, it was a lot of fun.

40:04.420 --> 40:05.820
It was a lot of practice.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.540
Last day, we ended up doing a hide and seek on the practice server

40:09.540 --> 40:11.100
as well in the Ace Race course.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.940
So that was fun because they have a lot of like places

40:13.940 --> 40:16.260
you can kind of get to that you're not supposed to.

40:16.260 --> 40:19.860
And so we were just messing around with that a bit.

40:19.860 --> 40:22.740
And that was pretty cool.

40:22.740 --> 40:26.140
Yeah. And then, of course, you know, MCC yesterday was really big.

40:26.140 --> 40:29.020
A lot of the week's actually been editing still.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.500
I've been doing a lot of stuff with my final episode.

40:31.780 --> 40:36.900
It's so this whole season has been kind of themed around like

40:38.580 --> 40:41.780
you didn't compromise on.

40:42.380 --> 40:43.220
You did too much.

40:43.220 --> 40:47.540
You won't compromise on like reducing it down to something that's manageable.

40:47.700 --> 40:48.940
And that's what the finale is.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.860
It's like it's like too much.

40:50.860 --> 40:53.460
And I'm not compromising on something that's more manageable.

40:53.460 --> 40:57.100
Instead, I'm just, you know, going to the extreme with it.

40:58.100 --> 41:02.900
So it gets pretty wild as far as like editing and stuff goes with it.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.220
And I'm very excited to have it done.

41:06.020 --> 41:08.220
I'm like, I have to look now.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.420
I'm pretty far into it, actually.

41:10.420 --> 41:16.820
I am already like 12 minutes into the episode already as far as fully edited.

41:16.820 --> 41:21.460
But the problem is the shots that I'm doing now are very complicated.

41:21.460 --> 41:25.100
So requires like six different replay shots for every shot that I do.

41:25.420 --> 41:27.940
Just because of different camera changes and

41:29.380 --> 41:32.860
having lots of characters teleport in and out of things.

41:32.980 --> 41:35.660
There's lots of teleportation and time travel and all this.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.820
It gets crazy, OK?

41:36.820 --> 41:39.500
It gets very crazy.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.300
So it's going to be fun.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.180
I am very excited to get it done.

41:43.180 --> 41:45.620
This week should be a lot easier to be able to concentrate on.

41:45.660 --> 41:48.020
I'm not splitting my time between practice and

41:49.260 --> 41:51.180
doing this stuff.

41:51.180 --> 41:52.820
I do want to get back onto the server

41:52.820 --> 41:54.580
to actually play with the new people and stuff.

41:54.580 --> 41:55.900
They've been great.

41:56.540 --> 42:00.060
We launched last week and and it's been fun.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.340
So we have lots of people on the server now.

42:03.380 --> 42:06.380
Shenang is happening and I haven't been part of it, a lot of it,

42:06.380 --> 42:10.020
because I haven't been on there, but I'm hoping to change that this week.

42:10.020 --> 42:14.860
So, yeah, it's just kind of switching gears

42:14.860 --> 42:19.420
from like overly complex and like big, huge things to try to make it more manageable.

42:19.980 --> 42:22.540
That said, I will easily slip into old habits.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.580
Pretty, it's going to happen.

42:25.580 --> 42:28.740
I guess it's just a matter of when I'm going to just do it.

42:29.140 --> 42:33.180
But I think with the fact that this season is going to be all based around

42:34.860 --> 42:38.780
an amusement park, so building an amusement park with rides and mini,

42:38.780 --> 42:41.060
it's all focused on rides and mini games.

42:41.060 --> 42:44.940
And so because of that, it's a lot of design that's going to have to go into it.

42:44.940 --> 42:48.060
So I don't think I can rush through it very much

42:48.060 --> 42:50.540
because designing mini games takes a long time.

42:50.980 --> 42:54.820
And so I'm going to try to break those projects up a bit if I can,

42:54.820 --> 42:58.460
because otherwise it'll be like two months between episodes and I'll do that.

42:58.660 --> 43:00.780
So we'll see. We'll figure it out.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.300
But it's going to be fun. All right.

43:04.540 --> 43:08.500
My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff, a lot of the same old stuff.

43:08.500 --> 43:11.180
Still playing a little bit Diablo for Final Fantasy 14.

43:11.180 --> 43:14.740
I needed to do the Moonfire Fair event to make sure

43:14.740 --> 43:17.580
I get my little Power Rangers outfit that they were given away this year.

43:17.860 --> 43:21.140
I need to make sure I do their new event before I leave for Atlanta,

43:21.140 --> 43:23.580
because I don't know if I'd have time when I get back.

43:23.580 --> 43:25.740
I passed in Diablo four.

43:25.740 --> 43:29.500
So my eternal character, whatever the permanent realm is called,

43:29.660 --> 43:32.140
was level 61 when the season started.

43:32.140 --> 43:34.140
And now my season character is 62.

43:34.140 --> 43:36.340
So I've officially passed that point

43:36.340 --> 43:39.540
where my season character is now stronger than my non seasonal one.

43:40.140 --> 43:42.980
And I'm almost completely through the battle pass.

43:42.980 --> 43:46.340
There's 90 stages, the battle pass. I hit 84 today.

43:46.660 --> 43:49.860
I'll probably clear the battle pass completely.

43:50.300 --> 43:53.500
But granted, because I bought the Uber edition,

43:53.500 --> 43:56.380
I had like a skip for 20 tiers or something.

43:56.380 --> 44:00.020
And then Amazon Prime was given away like four additional skips.

44:00.260 --> 44:01.580
So I was like, all right, whatever.

44:01.580 --> 44:04.260
So I can't say I did it all myself, but I

44:04.820 --> 44:07.820
considering I have until October for the season to be done,

44:07.820 --> 44:09.020
I probably would play enough.

44:10.500 --> 44:13.700
And then I've actually been playing a little bit of Overwatch two.

44:13.700 --> 44:16.300
Funny enough, I didn't really think I'd get back into this

44:16.300 --> 44:20.340
game, but I have a couple friend groups that are like, yeah, you should play.

44:20.340 --> 44:22.860
You should play. So I've been playing a little bit.

44:22.860 --> 44:26.500
And I find that I really enjoy playing Anna, actually.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.020
And I never thought I was very good with her,

44:28.020 --> 44:29.980
but she's actually a lot of fun to heal with.

44:29.980 --> 44:30.820
So I've been doing that.

44:30.820 --> 44:33.540
And then today I was exploring the PVE a little bit.

44:34.220 --> 44:38.580
I didn't buy the thing because I'm still trying to get a sense of if that's worth it.

44:38.780 --> 44:41.700
But they have like a limited time event that I already forgot the name of it,

44:41.700 --> 44:44.620
underworld or something like that, that has some different modes.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.860
There's like a regular mode and then there's like a don't stand

44:47.860 --> 44:49.140
where the rockets are going to fall.

44:49.140 --> 44:51.580
And then like basically like

44:51.980 --> 44:54.820
good zones and bads and another mode that's bad zones.

44:54.820 --> 44:57.180
So it's yeah, it's interesting.

44:57.500 --> 45:00.660
So I like that you get a lot of credit for

45:01.060 --> 45:03.740
not that I really care about the battle past Overwatch to begin

45:03.740 --> 45:07.220
a lot of credit for that type of stuff, even if

45:08.460 --> 45:10.940
you do the PVE stuff, which I find very interesting.

45:11.300 --> 45:14.220
But yeah, also tip on that.

45:14.220 --> 45:17.660
And this helped me incentivize me to play Xbox.

45:17.660 --> 45:22.500
Game Pass has a thing where you can unlock all of the new heroes

45:22.500 --> 45:26.740
in Overwatch to right up through the brand new healer lady.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.060
I think her name's Ilari.

45:28.060 --> 45:29.300
I hope I didn't get that wrong.

45:29.300 --> 45:31.540
But you can unlock everybody through her.

45:31.540 --> 45:34.980
All the people that have come out since Overwatch two on Game Pass.

45:34.980 --> 45:39.580
But you have to launch it on Xbox first

45:39.900 --> 45:43.180
and then through cross network stuff, it unlocks on your PC.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.660
So that's that's what I did. And it worked.

45:45.940 --> 45:48.140
So, yeah, I'll take it.

45:48.140 --> 45:50.420
But yeah, that was that was honestly pretty much it.

45:50.420 --> 45:52.700
My game, I think I maybe played one game of Dead by Daylight,

45:52.700 --> 45:55.060
but I've been I've been kind of sleeping on that a little bit.

45:55.060 --> 45:58.420
I think I'll I'll be more excited when the alien stuff comes out,

45:58.420 --> 45:59.220
which is next week.

45:59.220 --> 46:01.460
Well, I guess not because I'm going to be out of town.

46:01.460 --> 46:04.020
So maybe in two weeks, I'll get around to doing some of the alien stuff.

46:04.020 --> 46:06.740
But can't wait to play as Ripley, to be quite honest.

46:06.860 --> 46:08.620
That'd be awesome. I'll play it.

46:08.620 --> 46:11.180
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

46:11.180 --> 46:14.140
Well, actually, and also looking forward a little bit,

46:14.140 --> 46:17.180
what I'm actually really excited for, believe it or not, is Starfield.

46:18.060 --> 46:22.940
Just since I have Game Pass anyway, I'm absolutely going to pick it up.

46:23.820 --> 46:27.380
And I'm excited to see how it turned out.

46:27.380 --> 46:31.820
You know, there's a lot of chat about is this perhaps again?

46:31.820 --> 46:35.180
I guess there's rumors out there because people are playing it right now. Right.

46:35.420 --> 46:39.140
So even though it's embargoed, there is still some stuff getting out

46:39.780 --> 46:41.860
and you take it with a grain of salt.

46:41.860 --> 46:45.180
But one of the things that is getting out is that it is absolutely

46:45.180 --> 46:49.740
the least buggy Bethesda game and that that extra time kind of shows.

46:49.740 --> 46:54.300
So it'll be now again, take it with a big grain of salt, because I think,

46:54.540 --> 46:56.580
you know, who's playing the embargo right now?

46:56.580 --> 46:58.140
Journalists and influencers.

46:58.140 --> 47:00.180
That's who's playing the embargo on right now.

47:00.180 --> 47:02.100
Then when it gets out in front of the rest of the Internet,

47:02.100 --> 47:03.780
they're probably going to find things the others miss.

47:03.780 --> 47:07.260
So I you know, but that's just what some of the early buzz is.

47:07.460 --> 47:09.020
So I'll be very curious.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.540
That reminds me because of space.

47:10.540 --> 47:13.860
One other game I played this week was No Man's Sky just a little bit

47:14.500 --> 47:17.980
because I got my PlayStation version up and running because I was like,

47:18.300 --> 47:21.140
I want to chase some PlayStation five trophies in this game.

47:21.140 --> 47:23.980
I think I'm going to make a new little get the get my trophies in this.

47:24.420 --> 47:27.180
I played just a little bit for a night.

47:27.180 --> 47:28.540
I got like two trophies.

47:28.540 --> 47:30.500
And then I was like, I'm going to stream some of this later.

47:30.500 --> 47:33.300
And then the very next day.

47:33.300 --> 47:36.700
The echoes update came out and added all the new stuff.

47:36.740 --> 47:39.740
And so it was like, oh, well, if I stream this again, I'm going to.

47:39.740 --> 47:42.380
And then I got sidetracked to like Dragon Con stuff and IRL stuff.

47:42.380 --> 47:43.700
So I haven't really been streaming,

47:43.700 --> 47:46.940
even though No Man's Sky has a whole twitch drop thing going on again right now,

47:46.940 --> 47:48.180
which I'd love to participate in.

47:48.180 --> 47:50.580
But it's just really bad timing.

47:50.580 --> 47:52.180
It's a bummer. But yeah.

47:52.180 --> 47:54.380
Yeah. Questmaster says the echoes update is so massive.

47:54.380 --> 47:57.380
I guess they added a fourth alien race. That's huge.

47:58.220 --> 47:59.740
That's pretty incredible.

47:59.740 --> 48:02.420
So I'm I look forward to checking it out at some point.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.860
Anyway, let's get into some other gaming news.

48:05.860 --> 48:07.700
What else is going on around the industry?

48:07.700 --> 48:10.660
I'm going to take it to Loki to start us off tonight

48:10.660 --> 48:13.860
with a little bit of a wrap up of what happened at Gamescom.

48:13.860 --> 48:16.660
And I'm very sorry I need to step away for a moment, but take it away, Loki.

48:17.220 --> 48:20.620
Yeah. So with Gamescom, of course, we had opening night live,

48:20.620 --> 48:23.100
which was with Jeff Keighley.

48:23.100 --> 48:28.500
And with that, of course, lots of new trailers for different game titles.

48:29.020 --> 48:31.860
Some of these, of course, just coming out recently.

48:31.860 --> 48:35.820
So, for example, we got a launch trailer for Armored Core 6, Fires of Rubicon.

48:36.620 --> 48:40.780
Which launched this Friday and looks awesome.

48:40.780 --> 48:42.420
I need to pick it up.

48:42.540 --> 48:45.420
Alan Wake 2 got a new trailer as well.

48:45.780 --> 48:47.460
It looks pretty sweet.

48:47.460 --> 48:52.020
We got the announcement that Age of Empires 4 anniversary edition

48:52.020 --> 48:54.900
is now on Xbox Series X and S.

48:56.660 --> 49:00.180
Aura History Untold looked pretty cool.

49:00.700 --> 49:02.820
A live action Starfield trailer.

49:02.860 --> 49:05.380
I'm assuming this is the launch trailer for that as well,

49:05.380 --> 49:08.420
since this comes out literally in a couple of weeks here.

49:09.380 --> 49:10.620
Yeah, on the 6th, actually.

49:10.620 --> 49:12.460
So that's pretty nice.

49:12.460 --> 49:14.460
And what else?

49:15.020 --> 49:16.180
Another cool stuff.

49:16.180 --> 49:18.140
Assassin's Creed Mirage gameplay.

49:18.140 --> 49:20.100
That looks pretty cool.

49:20.100 --> 49:21.700
Black Myth Wukong.

49:21.700 --> 49:23.340
I think we've seen this before.

49:23.340 --> 49:25.260
It looks interesting.

49:25.260 --> 49:29.740
It's kind of that whole Chinese mythology, like an action RPG.

49:30.460 --> 49:32.700
I want to say we saw that around E3 time as well.

49:33.660 --> 49:38.100
Call of Duty Modern Warfare got some story gameplay.

49:38.100 --> 49:43.340
It showed off the first mission in the game and looks pretty cool.

49:43.340 --> 49:47.420
I try to think back to the original Modern Warfare 3

49:47.820 --> 49:50.540
and the mission in that if it's actually like a direct remake

49:50.540 --> 49:52.900
or if they're just kind of doing something else.

49:53.020 --> 49:54.460
I don't recall it, though.

49:54.460 --> 49:57.180
I know I played through it and it was a great game.

49:57.180 --> 49:59.780
So I'm kind of curious, maybe I should check this out.

50:01.100 --> 50:04.780
Crew Motorfest had also another launch

50:04.780 --> 50:08.220
or had a launch trailer as well that's coming out on September 14th.

50:09.060 --> 50:11.300
Crimson Desert got a trailer

50:11.420 --> 50:15.940
and it's showing off some of the new gameplay as well.

50:16.620 --> 50:20.980
Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty had another trailer as well.

50:20.980 --> 50:24.140
We just got one of those at Summer Games Fest.

50:24.900 --> 50:30.300
Dustborne kind of looks interesting, very cool, a stylized looking game.

50:30.300 --> 50:33.700
Kind of reminds me a little bit of Sunset Overdrive, but

50:34.940 --> 50:36.580
very cool looking.

50:36.580 --> 50:40.460
Diablo 4 got the Season of Blood announcement as well.

50:40.940 --> 50:42.540
Talking about that.

50:42.540 --> 50:46.700
Genshin Impact had a trailer as well as Honkai Star Rail,

50:46.700 --> 50:50.180
the announcement trailer for PlayStation 5.

50:50.900 --> 50:55.940
And then we've got Mudrunner or Expeditions Mudrunner.

50:56.540 --> 51:02.140
There is a premiere for that, and that's the game that's by Snowrunner as well.

51:02.380 --> 51:07.300
Snowrunner is kind of a very extremely realistic off-roading game,

51:07.300 --> 51:10.980
if I remember correctly, and that's coming out next year.

51:11.660 --> 51:15.540
Granblue Fantasy Relink, a new JRPG,

51:15.580 --> 51:20.380
and that's supposed to be coming out on February 1st, 2024.

51:21.500 --> 51:24.540
What else? The First Descendant.

51:24.540 --> 51:27.860
Looks pretty cool looking.

51:27.860 --> 51:30.100
A lot of these games are never going to play though, unfortunately.

51:30.700 --> 51:36.260
Fort Solace, which, of course, has Troy Baker, Juliet Brown, Roger Clark.

51:36.860 --> 51:41.420
And, you know, very story driven game there.

51:41.980 --> 51:44.380
Mortals of Avium.

51:44.380 --> 51:47.740
Looks like that's a Magic based FPS game.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.060
Very interested to play that.

51:50.060 --> 51:54.220
You know, once again, gives me the old heretic Hexen vibes, of course.

51:54.700 --> 51:57.780
And I think it's coming out later this year.

51:58.340 --> 52:02.020
We had Killing Floor 3

52:02.860 --> 52:07.660
got a pretty cool cinematic trailer as well.

52:08.660 --> 52:11.660
Little Nightmares 3, didn't even realize they had a third sequel for that,

52:11.660 --> 52:14.020
but that's going to be coming out next year as well.

52:14.580 --> 52:20.660
The Lords of Fallen remake that is going to got a brand new story trailer.

52:20.980 --> 52:24.100
Is that a remake? I actually maybe that's just a new RPG.

52:24.100 --> 52:25.620
I thought there was a Lords of Fallen game.

52:25.620 --> 52:28.020
I swear that that sounds awfully familiar,

52:29.180 --> 52:31.500
but that is going to be coming out as well.

52:32.060 --> 52:32.780
This is kind of cool.

52:32.780 --> 52:36.540
I mean, once again, a game I don't necessarily play, but I'm aware of Marvel Snap.

52:36.860 --> 52:39.780
They had a cool cinematic trailer that they put out for that.

52:40.140 --> 52:43.260
Honestly, I'll take just like the Marvel Snap animated

52:43.460 --> 52:45.580
like show at this point.

52:45.580 --> 52:49.980
I mean, with Deadpool in there and all the different iterations

52:49.980 --> 52:51.180
and all the anime style.

52:51.180 --> 52:54.340
Yes, please give me some like anime Marvel stuff.

52:54.580 --> 52:57.020
I'm down for that with Squirrel Girl and all that.

52:57.420 --> 52:59.020
So please.

52:59.460 --> 53:03.860
Moral Combat 1, they had a new trailer for that as well.

53:04.260 --> 53:08.060
And kind of also clean up the fatalities and whatnot.

53:08.140 --> 53:11.220
And I just I just want to say that when they announced

53:11.220 --> 53:14.140
Sindel, the gays cried out. Yes.

53:16.580 --> 53:18.860
Because I know I'm very excited to see Sindel back.

53:19.980 --> 53:24.780
And she's she's like the right kind of Sindel.

53:25.540 --> 53:26.820
Oh, she's does that make sense?

53:26.820 --> 53:28.820
No, she's stunning. She's good guy, Sindel.

53:28.820 --> 53:30.700
Yeah, no, she's good guy, Sindel.

53:30.700 --> 53:32.820
Oh, yeah, because yeah, because they you know, they're

53:32.860 --> 53:35.860
they're having fun with the reboot. Yeah.

53:35.860 --> 53:36.900
Yeah, yeah.

53:36.900 --> 53:40.140
I've watched like the whole 17 minutes of that game.

53:40.580 --> 53:41.780
Are you going to jump?

53:41.780 --> 53:44.980
I imagine Mortal Combat 1 is out on Steam, so you ought to be able to.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.180
It's got to be on cloud somewhere.

53:47.180 --> 53:49.420
Are you going to jump in on Mortal Combat 1, Jamie?

53:52.820 --> 53:54.900
I'm probably going to watch a lot of other people play it.

53:55.380 --> 53:56.100
OK, fair enough.

53:56.100 --> 53:59.220
It does have me like I don't like Mortal Combat

53:59.300 --> 54:02.340
just because I'm not really a big fighting game fan anyways,

54:02.340 --> 54:04.380
but when it came down like Street Fighter, Mortal Combat,

54:04.620 --> 54:07.220
like I definitely was more Street Fighter.

54:09.460 --> 54:13.180
I mean, I do like the DLC characters that they have, like both Homelander

54:13.180 --> 54:16.220
and what's his name from?

54:17.660 --> 54:19.980
From Invincible.

54:19.980 --> 54:21.300
I don't remember his name.

54:21.300 --> 54:24.060
It it looks incredible.

54:24.260 --> 54:26.900
So Omni Man, Omni Man, thank you.

54:26.900 --> 54:28.020
I couldn't remember.

54:28.020 --> 54:28.620
I will say this.

54:28.620 --> 54:31.700
I thought we had this on our show, but I guess I bumped it for something else.

54:31.740 --> 54:33.540
But dark to see a reminds me.

54:33.540 --> 54:37.020
Apparently, the fatalities all have descriptive audio.

54:37.180 --> 54:39.940
And yeah, I saw you and it's hilarious.

54:39.940 --> 54:41.900
It's great. It's great.

54:41.900 --> 54:42.780
It's pretty awesome.

54:42.780 --> 54:44.700
This British lady

54:45.060 --> 54:47.260
hiding it in such a flat monotone.

54:48.020 --> 54:48.700
That's right.

54:48.700 --> 54:51.500
And now we want to see that he's written.

54:51.500 --> 54:54.700
So she reaches for his for his neck and the spine breaks

54:54.700 --> 54:57.020
and you see the blood coming out through the X-ray.

54:57.540 --> 54:58.180
It's great.

54:58.180 --> 54:59.580
That's what she sounds like.

54:59.580 --> 55:01.660
I love it. I love that.

55:01.660 --> 55:04.700
That needs to be a staple in like all the fighting games. Mm hmm.

55:05.460 --> 55:07.300
But I mean, I mean, as

55:07.300 --> 55:09.500
and I want to point out, even though we're kind of laughing at it,

55:09.500 --> 55:13.460
because it's kind of like the it's like the absurdity of these games brought to life

55:13.780 --> 55:17.620
from an accessibility standpoint, that is bold, underlined, italic,

55:17.900 --> 55:21.940
fucking awesome that they're doing that, you know, and even though we're having to.

55:22.020 --> 55:26.340
Yeah, it's just we're teeing it because it brings the absurdity of Mortal Combat

55:26.340 --> 55:29.580
really just to the front and center and lays it on the table, you know.

55:29.900 --> 55:31.340
It's the voice, though.

55:31.340 --> 55:33.700
It's the lady's voice that does it for me.

55:34.180 --> 55:38.860
But it's and so after a knee to the groin, he doubles over in pain

55:39.060 --> 55:43.100
when she uses the opportunity to then bash his head in with a mallet.

55:43.420 --> 55:45.660
I like it.

55:45.780 --> 55:48.140
It definitely sounds like and I hate to do a South Park.

55:48.220 --> 55:49.460
My impression is good.

55:49.460 --> 55:52.820
I hope I hate to do a South Park reference in the year 2023.

55:52.820 --> 55:54.860
But it definitely reminds me of that one

55:54.860 --> 55:58.460
episode of like, thank you for calling the Worcestershire sauce company.

55:58.460 --> 56:01.300
If you're having a problem with Worcestershire, it's like that whole

56:01.460 --> 56:04.380
when I think they're turned into town into zombies or something.

56:04.380 --> 56:06.700
And it was very cool, collected British lady.

56:06.900 --> 56:09.700
It sounded like that in the

56:09.700 --> 56:13.860
trailers or the this audio description anyway. And.

56:15.580 --> 56:17.220
She sounds very bought.

56:17.220 --> 56:21.500
Yes, Bonsobo six says the fans went wild for Sandel.

56:21.500 --> 56:24.220
I saw so many streamers calling her new mommy.

56:24.260 --> 56:26.780
Yes, that is Sandel's mother.

56:26.780 --> 56:29.060
Yes, she's mother is mothering.

56:30.180 --> 56:33.500
Although I am very curious now with the changes with the whole

56:33.500 --> 56:37.220
Tarkatan thing, like what's what's Molina's deal? Mm hmm.

56:38.100 --> 56:40.820
So I'm into it like that was for me.

56:40.820 --> 56:42.100
I love the story.

56:42.100 --> 56:46.180
I just I I haven't played a Mortal Combat game

56:46.180 --> 56:48.580
and had fun since, you know, Mortal Combat.

56:49.500 --> 56:52.140
Two for a hot minute, actually, Mortal Combat two

56:52.140 --> 56:54.780
is probably still the pinnacle of Mortal Combat for me.

56:55.300 --> 56:57.860
I mean, same, but yeah.

57:00.420 --> 57:02.220
Let's see what else we had some Sonic stuff.

57:02.220 --> 57:06.020
So Sonic Frontiers, the final horizon is going to be, I think, a bit of

57:06.660 --> 57:08.780
DLC or an update that they're going to be getting.

57:08.780 --> 57:12.620
And they showed off that it has new stories and new playable characters.

57:13.620 --> 57:17.340
Sonic Superstars had another new trailer as well, showing off

57:17.340 --> 57:19.460
some of the co-op gameplay with that.

57:20.220 --> 57:22.860
We got a new trailer for Tekken eight,

57:22.860 --> 57:25.140
which showed off its arcade simulation mode

57:26.900 --> 57:28.420
under the waves.

57:28.420 --> 57:31.740
Got a new trailer as well, which is actually that game's

57:31.740 --> 57:33.860
coming out this week, so we'll have to check that out.

57:34.860 --> 57:37.660
This trailer absolutely blew me away.

57:37.700 --> 57:39.140
I need to play this game.

57:39.140 --> 57:43.980
I hope it's not just for PlayStation, because it was on the PlayStation Japan

57:44.340 --> 57:48.940
YouTube page, but it's called Thank Goodness You're Here.

57:49.180 --> 57:52.700
It is a hand drawn animated game.

57:52.740 --> 57:55.620
I don't know what it is, but it looks strange and I love it.

57:55.980 --> 57:57.260
I love the art style.

57:57.260 --> 57:58.660
I love the humor of it.

57:58.660 --> 58:00.500
I want this game now.

58:00.500 --> 58:03.300
Like, it looks amazing.

58:03.940 --> 58:06.380
And I think that's supposed to be coming out next year at some point.

58:06.380 --> 58:09.740
So cross my fingers that it's not just Sony.

58:11.260 --> 58:11.820
What else?

58:11.900 --> 58:15.140
We had a non-video game stuff

58:15.140 --> 58:19.340
with the Netflix trailer for Zack Snyder's

58:19.340 --> 58:23.300
new movie or movies with Rebel Moon.

58:24.140 --> 58:27.820
That is going to be coming out, I think, next year or later this year

58:27.820 --> 58:28.500
or something like that.

58:28.500 --> 58:29.660
I just want to get a couple of quick comments.

58:29.660 --> 58:30.620
Interesting.

58:30.620 --> 58:33.300
Orange Right says there's a trailer for Thank Goodness You're Here

58:33.300 --> 58:34.620
on Nintendo's YouTube.

58:34.620 --> 58:39.500
So, OK, good. OK, so it is on multiple consoles, but it looks fantastic.

58:39.540 --> 58:40.660
Like, absolutely.

58:40.660 --> 58:42.580
Watch the trailer if you haven't done it yet.

58:42.580 --> 58:45.500
It's just like it's it's almost Monty Python ish.

58:45.500 --> 58:49.700
It looks very similar to tell what I'm bringing up on the other screen.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.660
Sorry, because I want to take a look at this myself

58:51.660 --> 58:53.940
because I wasn't able to watch the live event.

58:53.940 --> 58:56.540
I think like some of you were able to.

58:57.260 --> 59:01.780
So, yeah, it's absolutely cool looking like this is the game that

59:03.420 --> 59:06.060
looks the most interesting to me.

59:06.060 --> 59:08.100
Yeah, it definitely looks like a full on cartoon.

59:08.100 --> 59:11.180
But I mean, that's what games are capable of doing these days.

59:11.180 --> 59:12.220
So that's very interesting.

59:12.220 --> 59:14.940
It just looks weird and I like weird.

59:14.940 --> 59:18.260
So OK, I'm down for this.

59:18.260 --> 59:20.860
It looks just strange.

59:20.980 --> 59:22.140
All right, let's check that out.

59:22.140 --> 59:23.420
Mike Deft is also asking,

59:23.420 --> 59:26.940
have you seen the trailer for Killer Bean, the game that is up your alley?

59:26.940 --> 59:28.380
I have seen so.

59:28.380 --> 59:33.500
OK, I'm not familiar with Killer Bean as like a YouTube series.

59:33.500 --> 59:36.140
I understand it is very old, obviously,

59:36.380 --> 59:40.020
but it sounds like the game is really cool, like very like they said

59:40.380 --> 59:42.540
compared to like John Wick and stuff.

59:42.540 --> 59:44.420
So I cool.

59:44.420 --> 59:48.340
I will have to check it out, but I'm not familiar with the Killer Bean lore.

59:48.820 --> 59:52.300
But that does look extremely cool.

59:52.740 --> 59:55.180
And I'm glad that it's getting its own game.

59:55.180 --> 59:57.740
I mean, this whole ridiculousness of shooting from a car,

59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.460
then jumping out on your jet pack and shooting from your jet pack

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.620
and then on the ground and shooting for your guns on the ground.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.940
It does seem very low key to me.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.140
It's OK.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:09.620
So it's very much Saints Row.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.180
Just cause, you know, granted,

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.900
dark like all smashed into one. Exactly.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.540
So here's the thing is like, OK, well, if I can't get my Saints

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:23.220
Row gameplay from Saints Row, I'm just going to have to get it from Killer Bean

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.220
then, like this is the type of stuff that you should be doing.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.940
Look, it's ridiculous.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.700
I don't mean to be shady, but this looks like the game that this looks like

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:35.540
the kind of game that has a great trailer and then gets a 34 on Metacritic.

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.420
Not that Metacritic is the end all be all, but it just it

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:43.100
it kind of looks like one of those games that I again, maybe I'll be wrong.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.180
It's just one of those games that probably actually runs like, oh, sure.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.220
Like, honestly, it doesn't look super great.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.180
Like it does look like PlayStation three era stuff. We'll see. We'll see.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.220
But I mean, is the game plays there?

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.460
All right. Anyway, sorry.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:00.060
You were talking about non game related things, Loki, like the Netflix stuff.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.620
Yeah. So, yeah, Rebel Moon.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.340
There's going to be two.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:07.820
It's a Zack Snyder film and it's supposed to be like R rated Star Wars type of thing.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.420
I mean, it's very Star Wars looking.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.140
And also there's unicorn or not.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.580
It was a unicorn or no, it was a Griffin.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.860
There's like a Griffin thing.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.100
And they're supposed to be split up in two movies.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.940
And he has like a director's cut, which is five hours long as well,

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.780
because, you know, it's Zack Snyder and that's the kind of thing he does.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.900
So that'll be coming out at some point.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:34.220
Um, well, so we had a trailer for Payday three

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.180
with Ice-T making a cameo in that.

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:41.620
Oh, I guess, um, Nightingale.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.940
It's a horror card based survival game.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.020
So that looks interesting.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.740
And I think that was it.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.140
Oh, Last Epoch.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:55.020
They showed some gameplay footage from that as well.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.380
And that there was some dude that ran up

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.460
on stage and asked about Grand Theft Auto six,

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.980
because Jeff Keighley has poor security at his events

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.420
and people just rust the stage now.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.380
Yeah, that was going to get hurt.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.220
Well, I was really messed up, though, to be quite honest, like.

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.740
We should be past this point.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.380
You know what I mean?

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:21.140
Like, it's let the man have a taser on stage at this point, to be honest.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.940
Or just like better security.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.980
Like, how are these people getting in these events?

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.300
Like, honestly, like

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.420
who are these people that are just getting in and you're just like

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.820
they're letting them run up on stage and like, OK, cool.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.340
Anybody can do this now.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.820
Now it's happened twice and now people are going to try even harder.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:43.500
Yeah, like you got to you got to get this stuff under control, man.

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.500
Yeah, it's for your own safety.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.180
I mean, because like what if someone's just really mad at you

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.580
and then they decide, oh, hey, I'm just going to go kill him,

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.140
you know, rush up on stage and like, you know,

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:58.860
because I want to make a scene and and be infamous that way, like.

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.620
You got to get that stuff under control. Yeah.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.100
All right, well, I think they were right to maybe temper

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.140
the expectations a little bit, but I think by doing so, they ended up

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.580
having a fairly successful like, you know, I think they delivered

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.380
on what they promised.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.140
It was updates on games and a few interesting new things.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.380
I think they set the expectations very well.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.180
And that's that's definitely a hint for what to do in the future, for sure.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.100
So, yeah, because I think they were like saying, like, listen,

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.300
we're not going to be announcing like another Zelda Breath of the Wild.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.540
Here's the kingdom nonsense that, you know, like really simmered

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:36.260
those expectations down.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.340
Yeah, we'll save that for, you know, the game awards as well.

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.260
Well, now it's all that stuff which is going to be happening.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.740
And, you know, it was confirmed it's happening,

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.500
but that really shouldn't be a surprise, right? So, yeah.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.460
All right. Moving on.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.500
Let's talk about some other news

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.860
that came out around the same time this week.

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.300
Let's talk about Arcade 1up, because you'll notice

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.380
if you watch a live on Twitch, I have a couple of these machines.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.940
I think they're fun.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.260
Some collectible purists don't care for them.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.220
I think they're neat.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.700
I think it's fun to have in a little game room.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.140
I actually I didn't talk about during my game week, gaming week,

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.580
but I did play my Tron machine a little bit this week.

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:12.660
So I do actually play them once in a while.

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.060
Not all the time, but I do. I do actually play them.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.900
And, you know, many of you who do watch live notice

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.660
I have the perfect amount of space for a third machine,

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.900
although I'd probably have to move the couch if I did it.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.140
And that's my napping couch.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:31.020
I don't know how I feel about that, but I have my couch looks familiar.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.460
I it from my mom's place.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.660
No, the ones that used to be yours downstairs. Yeah.

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.300
No. OK. Yeah.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.780
A moment. It looks like it.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.100
But yeah. So this

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.820
space at some point will get filled in.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.260
And there's a really good contender here for what they announced this week.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:56.940
And that is a time crisis machine that is coming out for six hundred dollars.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.260
But here's the thing.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.620
Time crisis is the main game in it and what everything is kind of labeled as.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.580
But guess what?

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.700
Since it is a Namco game with light guns,

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.620
guess what's in the the list of other games?

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.660
Point blank is also in the time crisis machine.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.860
Oh, no, I don't need to know this.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.220
I don't want to know this.

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.900
I know that's the bucket list right there.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.300
I know. But here's the thing.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.340
It's not point blank and point blank, too. So.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.740
But yeah, that's I know.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.700
So it's time crisis point blank.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.940
Steel Gunner and Steel Gunner two are what make up this cabinet here.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.900
So, yeah, if they did a point blank branded one

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.060
with both point blanks in it, because I think there was only two in the arcade.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:46.020
Right. There was a they have a new one now as well.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.300
Oh, they have a ticket game, don't they?

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.260
No, it's not a ticket game. It's called Gum Bullet.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:54.340
It's it's a new one that they actually have at the round one near us

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:55.700
because I've played it there.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:06:00.500
OK, but yeah, it's it's not a ticket game either.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:05.020
Well, there were some other machines that were announced as well worth pointing out.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.980
Galaga is another machine coming.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.060
But these are these are kind of just rebranding of things

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.580
they've already put out, to be quite honest.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.140
Galaga is going to release Galaga again.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.020
I mean, honestly, like that in Pac-Man, they've kind of done this machine before.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.460
It's just all the big Namco hits, but it's just the Galaga branding now in a full.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.060
I think this might be a full size.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.900
Oh, that's what it is. It's a deluxe.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.500
So it's a full size cab as opposed to the ones behind me are actually what?

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.740
Three quarter of the, you know, normal size.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.020
And speaking of deluxe, a Street Fighter two deluxe.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.820
Again, they've had a regular, but the full size machine is coming later this year.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.740
Also kind of interesting.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.300
Wheel of Fortune.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.540
They have casino machines.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.140
Oh, yeah. The Wheel of Fortune machine is apparently legit.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.980
Like it's it's interesting.

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.140
This machine looked interesting to me, too.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:56.300
It's an Atari 50th anniversary deluxe machine.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.140
The only thing I like what they're putting in it.

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:05.900
I just don't like the look like I can only take so much of that Atari 50 logo.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:11.740
And I really wish they'd kept the 50 maybe on the riser and on the marquee.

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:15.580
But maybe done a compilation of Atari are on the side.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:20.780
I don't just like white panel the side and then like an Atari logo or something like that.

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.940
So I don't love the look of this thing.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.460
But this thing apparently does have quite a few games in it

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.220
because it actually has 50 Atari 2600 games.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:34.580
That's a first for these cabs to have the console games actually in them.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.660
And then it has their typical I mean, they've had Atari arcade one ups before,

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.300
whether it was branded centipede or the branded Tempest.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:44.060
It pretty much has the usual lineups in there no matter what.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:48.220
But the fact that it's deluxe means it's going to be a big one and so on and so on.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:52.340
So yeah, like I like the machine in theory.

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.740
I just don't like how it looks.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:57.460
So I kind of I kind of hope there's a refresh of that, to be honest,

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.660
because I might get it if they were to put out one that looked a little different.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.900
So. But yeah, that was some news out of arcade one up.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:10.820
So fun, fun for the collectors that like to drop this way for the point blank.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.460
When they come out eventually.

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.540
All right. Well, speaking of honestly,

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.420
you could probably just buy a point blank at this point.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.300
I mean, I mean, yeah, honestly. Yeah. Like.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.540
I wonder how they get. Yeah, you'd have to find one.

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.860
I wonder how hard it would be to fix if it was broken.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.340
But I guess there's no specialty.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:37.540
Like there's some glass shops that actually sell the tubes for a CRT

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.860
and transistors for, you know, classic

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.940
audio receivers and whatnot.

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.660
Yeah, I need to have someone come repair my my monitor in my

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.660
Astra City because it is no worky.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.420
Oh, that's a bummer.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.380
Yeah. All right.

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:58.220
Well, speaking of anticipated releases, Dark Soccer's next story is about one.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.100
Well, it's more about what happens when you jump the gun.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:09.460
So there's been, you know, talk and speculation about Starfield coming out

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:16.220
and a guy has been arrested and charged with theft of the game.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.540
It is a 29 year old.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.180
Darren Harris posted the first 45 minutes of the game online.

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:29.700
And of course, it was taken down from YouTube, but people were still sharing it.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:33.940
He also posted listings for additional copies of the game.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:38.540
And there were videos of him going to FedEx to pay to ship it.

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.900
The affidavit was filed in Shelby County

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:47.580
and the Memphis Police Department

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.980
were also reached out to by head of security and loss prevention

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.460
at Vantiva, formerly Technicolor,

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.220
telling them about the theft and that some of the victims

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:02.900
about the theft and that Starfield was not available for release until September 6th.

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.820
Of course, they basically with

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.580
the two facilities working together,

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.980
they were able to get a search warrant and search through Harris's home.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.980
They found a FedEx package sealed with a copy of the game

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:26.700
for Xbox Series Starfield games and two Xbox Series upgrade editions

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:31.900
and three handguns and some pot that one of the handguns was stolen.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:36.180
So he was arrested on August 24th.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.580
So just a couple of days ago.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.540
Now, he told the police, Harris that is, told the police

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:45.460
that he purchased the game from an unknown individual.

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:49.460
But anyway, he was charged with felony

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.220
theft of property between twenty five hundred and ten thousand dollars.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:57.540
Misdemeanor, theft and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.420
Oh, that's right. It's not legal there.

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.180
Yeah, I was going to say, the marijuana charge is bullshit,

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.860
but the rest of it is, you know.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.980
Yeah, he's got a bond of ten thousand dollars,

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:10.220
which is posted on this past Friday.

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.620
And yeah, so.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:20.860
Yeah, he got caught in this day and age, it's almost impossible not to get caught.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.140
Well, especially when you're filming yourself doing it

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.180
and being so brazen about it, that's the thing.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:29.020
It he, you know, to be clear, he's not they're entitled to it.

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:33.220
Yeah, he's not arrested for broadcasting the game early on YouTube.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.060
That's a very hard thing to.

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:36.740
And plus, that would be really a criminal thing.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.580
That could be a civil thing, but it wouldn't be something this quick.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:45.460
It's the whole like essentially the FedExing video is that that's the problem,

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:49.380
because, you know, in order for this thing to be in this guy's possession,

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.020
it would have had to have been stolen.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.940
As they point out, it was not set to release until September six.

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.220
This person I am imagining is not an official distributor of the product.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.660
Therefore, there's only one way that this individual gets the product.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.060
Now, whether he stole it or somebody stole it for him,

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:10.300
he's still in possession of it and trying to sell it and filming himself doing so.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.660
And that's a crime.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.220
And I just want to point out that the same guy is not the same dude

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:17.860
who's the CEO of Jack in the Box.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.500
I did not know that the CEO of Jack in the Box had the same name,

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.540
which is ironic when you consider the type of food the Jack in the Box sells.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:31.300
But I all of it fried, even the tacos are deep fried.

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.380
It's disgusting.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.580
It's it's stoner food.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:34.340
That's all it is.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:34.980
Jack in the box.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.420
It's just call it's they should just call it four twenty six nine

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.460
because that is what Jack in the Box food is.

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.300
They had a they had a was it one of those

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.260
was it one of those

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.860
late night meals or whatever that's put together by Snoop Dogg.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.780
They know who their audience is.

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:58.180
So there's a post on Twitter right now

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.380
saying the leaker who posted Starfield gameplay has been arrested for theft.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.660
Looks like he stole the Xbox Series X constellation edition

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.940
of Starfield from the warehouse.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.020
Not good. Not good.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.940
Yeah. And he went and leaked the gameplay.

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.620
Yeah, that's that's where it gets bold.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:21.500
And he put up a response video said, Todd, no offense, man.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.780
That's a good game. Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.500
That's what the questions were just put in chat.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.900
It's it's not just that he said that, but apparently he was smoking

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.900
some of the other substance in the video and then was like, that's a good game.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:37.100
Todd, like there it you can be nice about it, but you still stole it.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.660
That's yeah.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.220
I just still think that's a funny, you know, end cap.

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:45.700
It is what's it's also kind of one of those like I

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.540
I wonder if the dude's a little troubled,

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:52.740
you know, to be so bold for some of it, like it almost strikes me

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:57.140
as a call for attention and help like and that's where this kind of gets less funny

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:00.540
is it's you know, how much of this was doing it for the profit

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.620
and how much of it was doing it for some type of.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.940
Acknowledgement or something, you know, it's just it's unfortunate.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:12.020
Anyway, in brighter news,

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.020
maybe in the legal world, I don't know what to think of this.

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.220
But Loki. Yeah.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:21.820
So as I guess an additional step to try to get past the whole

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.460
UK regulatory boards, the Competition and Markets Authority,

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:31.980
Microsoft has announced that they are going to be partnering with Ubisoft

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:35.180
plus to stream their

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.060
will hopefully acquired Activision games

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.900
upon completion of the merger.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:46.340
So they made a deal with them for 15 years.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:51.780
And I think also I think they can also renegotiate that later.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.780
But it's yeah, basically allowing them to.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:00.460
So they're not exclusively going to be on the Microsoft platforms,

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:05.300
I think is what the main goal of that is basically saying, yeah, this is

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:09.580
to address the concerns and impact of the proposed acquisition

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:14.580
on cloud gaming or cloud game streaming raised by the UK competitive

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:15.700
and markets authority.

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:21.300
We are restructuring the transaction to acquire a narrower, narrower set of rights.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:25.020
This includes excluding or executing an agreement effective

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.660
at the closing of our merger that transfers the cloud streaming rights

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:33.220
for all current and new Activision, Blizzard, PC and console games

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.340
released over the next 15 years to Ubisoft.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:42.060
A leading global game publisher, the rights will be in perpetuity,

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:45.180
so they're giving them the rights for any of the games that are coming

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.260
within the next 15 years.

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:49.140
So I'm wondering, does that mean that they're not going to be streaming

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:53.580
those on the cloud service or they're just adding them to that?

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.980
I'm not I'm curious to see what they were being added to it,

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.180
that it was something that the Ubisoft plus platform

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:04.020
be able to integrate, just like because they already have the deals with

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:09.620
some of the other cloud companies over there in the UK for that stuff.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:12.660
So I want to say Amazon's was one of them and

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.900
some of the other big ones over there,

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.660
the one the one that Dark Sakura used to use before she switched.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.660
I can't remember the name of it.

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.260
You know what would be funny is they they make you're a gamer.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.340
No, they make that the UK streaming site.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.260
You like them. Oh, Boosteroid.

01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:29.940
That's it. Boosteroid. That was it.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:30.820
I couldn't remember the name.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:35.380
It'd be it'd be funny if like the whole this is like a big trick.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.860
And, you know, basically you're saying, oh, yeah, we're going to give the rights

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.500
to Ubisoft plus, you know, in perpetuity to have this.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.780
And then they've already made a deal with Ubisoft to include the Ubisoft

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.660
plus as part of Game Pass, like that would be funny.

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:51.220
Who's somebody more problematic than us that we can give the rights to?

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.020
I mean, this is this is just it's a Hail Mary play.

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.380
They this this is it.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.340
This is the one thing that's standing between them and getting this deal

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.140
to go through and they know it hinges on cloud stuff.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.380
And so they're like, you know what?

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:07.380
We're going to go to our one of our biggest competitors.

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.180
Like it was it was this or EA.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:11.020
And I don't think EA is set up in this.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.180
I don't think Origin does the cloud stuff.

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.460
So they went over to Ubisoft and said, look,

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:20.860
we're willing to literally give it to you so we can have all this other stuff.

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.820
You know, because maybe they're still thinking cloud gaming

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:28.060
isn't even going to take over still for 15 years.

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:29.620
You know, probably.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:33.820
I mean, maybe it kind of depends on 5G and a lot of that, I think.

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.380
But, you know, I digress a little bit.

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.580
It is definitely a Hail Mary play.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.780
Like they want this to go through and this is this is

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:44.140
they're doing the most that they can do to make this happen.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.860
Basically. Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:51.780
Let's see. Quest Buster says you can almost hear Activision

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:57.060
Blizzard's lawyers grunting as they hurled this as far as they could to the end zone.

01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:01.420
I mean, typically sports references are lost on me, but that one I get.

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.900
And yes, this it's very that

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:08.980
this is very much a.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:11.620
You know, go go long type of thing.

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:13.380
All right.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.180
Speaking of things in the Microsoft world, you know, there's another game

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.260
we haven't really been talking about enough on this show.

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.180
I just think it hasn't

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.380
been a game we've been playing yet.

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:26.860
I know it's something I plan to jump into probably when I'm back from DragonCon.

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:29.700
But I've watched a lot of my friends streaming this one.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.860
And this is Baldur's Gate three.

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.740
And apparently it is very, very good.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:37.620
And it's supposed to release on PlayStation on September six.

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.100
That'll be out on PlayStation five.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.820
But it wasn't going to release on Xbox.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.460
But that was magically resolved this week.

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.540
It sounds like it honestly sounds like at Gamescom,

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:52.180
Larian Studios and Phil Spencer like sat down like this isn't confirmed.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.820
But like you just really get that vibe that Phil Spencer was like.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.700
How do we make this happen?

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.940
We're going to do it.

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.340
How do we make this happen?

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:03.420
And the answer to how did they make this happen was basically

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.500
give us an exception that we do not have to grant feature parody

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.380
on the Xbox Series S.

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.780
And that exception was granted.

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.940
Games that release on Xbox Series X

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:19.020
must also run with feature parody on the Xbox Series S.

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:24.020
This game will get an exception to that waiver and cross

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:28.900
a split screen, excuse me, split screen multiplayer is the feature

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:33.940
that they could not get working with the appropriate amount of quality on the S.

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:35.740
So it will be cut.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.140
But they are saying they are going out of their way to say

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.980
it still has cloud based storage and all this.

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.820
So they're like, it still has everything else you can.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.700
If you started a game on S, you can still transfer it somewhere else later.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.060
You won't be losing your progress.

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:52.820
But still, I know people that game on series S that will probably be sad.

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:53.780
In fact, there it is.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.300
Dark Tetsuya says, I mean,

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:58.340
hate to lose couch co-op because we love gaming together,

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.380
but we'll definitely look out for this.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.660
Well, for what it's worth, I mean, you'd have to spend the money, which sucks.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:09.020
But you could one of you on the series S and one of you on the computer

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:11.500
and play, you know, across the Internet.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.820
But it's not the same.

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:18.380
But, well, yeah, people have completely turned me off of that game.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.260
Oh, really? Yeah.

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:24.660
Just all of the thirst on the Internet and all the oh, sexy scenes, blah, blah.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.700
I'm like, I'm not interested. Pass.

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.060
Well, there is that, but there's a lot more.

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.740
I know there's more to it, but it's just all of the the hoopla about it

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.580
just completely turned me off of it.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:37.540
I'm not interested.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:42.260
I mean, I would rather play second edition D&D with my friends at the table.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:47.740
To me, I would say like Mass Effect, you know, especially with the first game,

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.180
those sex scenes had a lot of attention in the very beginning,

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.540
because remember what was on Fox News and all this stuff about, oh, my God,

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.740
you can fuck an alien because of Liara and all this stuff.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.420
And it and it was gay alien, too, because femshep could,

01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.460
even though Liara's race doesn't have jet.

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.300
But anyway, it's it was still everybody was losing their goddamn minds.

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.300
And then it's it's there.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.260
But yeah, but I came into Mass Effect much later.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:15.740
That is true. That is true. Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:19.340
And. It's just like

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:25.620
there is way too much focus on those aspects in games that for,

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:30.020
you know, people who like, no, I just want a good, solid game

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:35.180
with a good, solid story, and I don't need that to advertise it to me, you know?

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.580
And I'm not saying, you know, oh, be prudes and blah, blah, blah.

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:42.700
I'm just saying that for me as an ace person, it completely turned me off.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:47.660
Well, Questbuster hears you in chat saying as someone that plays BG3,

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:51.420
I'm also tired of seeing so many people gravitating towards the thirst, too,

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.060
because there's so much more to do other than that. So, yeah.

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.060
All right. Well, let's move on to a console.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:01.900
You definitely can't play Baldur's Gate three on, but still might be kind of fun.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.340
What you mean the one I probably have a couple of of them?

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.500
Well, this particular one's a little new, but yeah, I get what you're saying.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:19.900
There is going to be a recreation of the Atari 2600

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.060
and all of its wood paneled glory

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:29.180
to be released. It plays games from the 2600 and 7800 consoles.

01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:31.140
Why not the 5200?

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.540
I mean, they are bigger cartridges.

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:35.700
And you just answered it because that was out there on Twitter.

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:39.300
They answered it. It's that. I figured. Yeah, that's OK.

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.100
I have two of those

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.940
with controllers notorious for breaking.

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:49.340
But anyway, the 2600 plus is got the,

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.500
you know, the the late 70s, early 80s wood grain.

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:57.100
And it's based off of the four switch model.

01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:04.420
It has a reproduction CX40 controller and supports USB power and HDMI.

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:08.020
The logo on it lights up

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.340
and it has a 10 in one cartridge

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:16.340
that has some pretty notable classic games.

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:24.820
So if if for people who've wanted to know

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:30.380
if it's original hardware, like using FPGA or if it's emulation,

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:35.380
it's been vague.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:41.060
So. It's.

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:44.420
Most of the games are compatible,

01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:49.220
so you should be able just to plug in your your cartridge.

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:54.260
And. It's a.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:00.540
It's it's going to be something that you can plug in on an HD screen

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.380
and not have the same input like you would using

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:11.140
like a modified route through an RF out or or

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:16.660
an or composite, because there are the composite mods for the 2600 already.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.460
But it'll be it'll be good.

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:25.540
And also Atari is producing new titles

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.060
for the old consoles, so that's something there.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.460
It's supposed to ship in November this year,

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.540
and it looks like it's going to sell for one hundred and twenty nine ninety nine.

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.580
And you know what?

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.380
Um, I'm curious. I'm curious.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:48.020
So I'm looking at the list of games that have been tested with it.

01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.380
There are I'm not seeing any.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:58.540
OK, one game that's failed a super cobra out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:02.380
isn't isn't working, you know, just for competition with game.

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.460
They're but most of the ones put in there have passed

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:10.420
and there's a few untested left to left to try.

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:15.540
So and on top of that, that Texas Chainsaw Massacre game was like not

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.940
like fully legit, so.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.980
You know, I will say, though, this 2600 plus is

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:28.900
it's it's more interesting than the Atari VCS thing they were trying,

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.740
which I guess is still technically a thing that whole.

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:35.180
I have almost said high end computer, and it wasn't even that.

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.060
It was just a computer that was branded Atari.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.540
This sounds more interesting because at least it leans into the shit

01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.980
that Atari is known for.

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:46.380
I like the fact that it's twenty six hundred and seventy eight hundred.

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:49.420
Like it's I understand why they had to leave out the fifty two hundred.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.700
But I think it's it's interesting to me.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:53.540
That's one hundred.

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.060
Matt and Chad says most people want to be able to plug and play

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.380
without having to jump through conversion boxes, et cetera,

01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.900
to make it work on new TVs. I'm kind of in that boat.

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:02.740
I have a lot of my old Atari cartridges,

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.420
but don't really have an old CRT TV to play it on. Yeah.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:09.540
I I still worry the price they're asking is a little high,

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.340
especially when you put it next to like the flashback consoles.

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.380
Now, look, I know the flashbacks run on emulation.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:19.340
You know, it's it's maybe a different level of collection purity for people.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.220
I don't know.

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:24.740
But that's my one concern is I feel like the price might be a little high.

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:28.660
But maybe maybe the if the thing is fucking

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.700
sturdy like an old Atari was,

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.300
then maybe maybe I'm not giving it enough credit, you know.

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.420
So we'll see.

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.220
Of what Rob?

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:42.660
I was going to say, if you think about it,

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:47.740
the original cost of the Atari twenty six hundred was one hundred

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:51.900
and eighty nine ninety five, which as of two thousand

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.620
twenty two would be the equivalent equivalent of nine hundred and twenty dollars.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:00.220
So technically you're getting this cheaper than the original.

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:03.940
But if the original hardware is still in this thing,

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:08.340
which is still under debate, I guess so.

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.340
But it's it's interesting. I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:15.500
I still kind of maybe want one like I just I do love retro games

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.860
and I love that stuff.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:20.420
I don't think I have a lot of Atari twenty six hundred cartridges anymore.

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:25.140
I mean, and I like I couldn't lend you a handful of them or a box full.

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:28.660
And they're usually pretty easy to find at like estate sales

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.740
and garage sales and stuff.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.700
Most people don't really know the value of them.

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.740
And there's but I the only interesting thing is, I wonder

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:38.060
if machines like this that will now play the games all over again.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.140
I wonder if it'll actually cause the cost of some cartridges to go up.

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.100
I don't know. It could be interesting. Maybe. Yeah.

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:45.740
So. All right.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:50.700
Well, let's move on to another console that was announced this week.

01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:53.140
Oh, gosh, this thing looks stupid.

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:56.700
I mean, honestly, it's so it's a PlayStation five.

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.900
They're remote gameplay console.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.740
It's called the PlayStation Portal.

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.220
It is for the PlayStation five.

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:08.980
It allows you to do the remote play with it, and it's two hundred dollars.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.820
So here's the fun things they can't do.

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:16.900
One, it you can only use PlayStation

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:21.380
Bluetooth headphones with it.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.940
You cannot use your own Bluetooth headphones with it.

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:27.300
It does have a three point five millimeter audio jack,

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:30.220
so you can plug in your own headphones if you have those.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.740
Thanks. How gracious of you.

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.340
It only works over Wi-Fi.

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:38.340
And I think you have to be.

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:43.700
You have, of course, you have to have your PlayStation five connected

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:47.340
and plugged in, turned on, connected to the Internet in order to do that.

01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:51.100
It's just it's a very, very narrow use case.

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:54.220
For this one, you know.

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:58.220
I'm pretty sure a steam deck can run PlayStation

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:02.060
streaming as well, for at least on PC.

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.660
And then on top of that, like it can't play games natively.

01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.020
You have to be connected to a PlayStation five.

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:11.860
It just doesn't seem very well.

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:15.660
And they even have things for your cell phone where you can get

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:19.220
basically a controller that straps to your cell phone

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.700
that allows you to kind of create something similar to this

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:24.220
without buying a dedicated device. So.

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:28.900
I don't really understand what this is for.

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:35.300
Yeah, I don't know about this.

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:39.220
It's it's a little too many, a few too many restrictions for me.

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:43.660
Like I feel I feel like they're like trying to capitalize on the switch,

01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:47.860
but not understanding what makes the switch so popular.

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:52.660
Like, yeah, it's it's also ugly looking, too, like it's a big, huge

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.540
it's like a tablet with controllers stuck to the side.

01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.180
That part doesn't bother me nearly as much.

01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.460
Like, I think it's just one of those things where it's like the whole fact

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:03.820
that it it has no memory or way to play the game

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.300
unless you're still in your own house.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.180
Like, I feel like it limits the use case so bad

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:14.340
because, you know, with the Nintendo Switch, you can play it in a car

01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:18.860
or a bus or public transit or a plane or going anywhere, you know,

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:21.500
or a hotel room like it's just so damn convenient.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.860
You can pick it up and take it anywhere.

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.340
This doesn't really let you do that.

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.500
Now, maybe if it had some type of.

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:33.140
Connection where you could tap into the hotel's Wi-Fi

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.460
and play your PS5 at home on Wi-Fi, I don't think it would be very good.

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.980
But but you can't even really do that.

01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.220
I just I'm just not sure who the hell this is for.

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.980
Yeah, they say that you can do it with

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:49.620
as a connection, as slow as five megabits per second.

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:54.580
But they recommend 15, which I think for most hotel Wi-Fi,

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:58.700
you probably could get get around that like that would probably be fine.

01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:01.780
But once again, you know, you have to have your PlayStation

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.580
powered up and stuff, and it's not going to be still.

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.100
As good as like playing on the actual thing,

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.700
I just don't see the point of like carrying this with me.

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.460
It would be such a cumbersome thing.

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:15.540
I would think for your money, you may be spending a little bit more

01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:18.420
to get something like that, but probably a steam deck.

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:21.100
Honestly, a steam deck, I think, could probably run

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:25.100
the PlayStation streaming stuff if they still have that for PC.

01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:28.100
I thought that that was still a thing they used to have a little while ago.

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:32.140
But if you can still do that via PC,

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:35.020
then why would I buy this dedicated thing that can only this?

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:40.300
And then once you stop playing, your PlayStation five is just garbage.

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:41.780
It's e-waste at that point.

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:43.980
You can't use it for anything.

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:46.460
So no, no, thanks.

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:50.300
All right. So so Shane is in chat right now with a well, actually,

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:54.940
who is saying for me, my PlayStation five is downstairs.

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.700
I like to play in bed upstairs.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.700
This negates having to lug it back and forth.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:00.540
But that screen worries me.

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:05.220
I just like I get it for you specifically, but I still feel like it's

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.980
there's not enough people with those types of use cases

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:13.460
to justify this thing being a success unless the expectations

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:17.180
are really low for this thing, which maybe they are. I don't know.

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.580
I, I feel like and maybe I'm wrong,

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:25.620
but Sony's time would have been better spent making a portable PlayStation four

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:31.100
that actually can carry your digital PlayStation four library with you

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:34.940
or something where like the disk, if it's your PS4, you can like

01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:38.500
have a temporary version of it on your device.

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.380
You can take it with you, so to speak, like a way to do that.

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:44.820
Like, I still feel like that would be far more interesting than.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.740
And the reason why I say PS4 is because I realize

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:51.500
the portable tech is probably too expensive to do a PlayStation five.

01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:53.220
But let's take it back to the last gen.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.460
Yeah. And there are even like a lot of PS4 games

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.540
and a lot of stuff to play on it.

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:02.300
I just are just a souped up PlayStation TV again.

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:04.580
Like, you know, that was Vita tech at one point.

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.700
And you could do streaming that way.

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.700
Like, just do something like that.

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.260
That's far less expensive.

01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:12.220
Like, it doesn't even have to have a portable screen.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:13.780
You just have it hooked up to a TV.

01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.140
I just think it's.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.060
I just don't see the point of this, like

01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:21.660
considering that everybody like, do you not have a cell phone?

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:22.980
I mean, like a lot of people have cell phones.

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:26.740
I think it would be a lot easier just to get a cell phone device

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:33.260
and buy a controller or I'm pretty sure they even sell one already for this.

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:34.620
Like buy their controller.

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:38.660
That's probably sub $100 and just strap it to your cell phone

01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:41.580
because at the very least, you know, that's a controller.

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:45.220
It would be even better if that controller could work separately,

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:49.460
as well as like a DualSense controller with the PlayStation

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.540
and just have that type of thing.

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.900
Or you could even like, you know,

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.380
I don't know what other solutions they have with that.

01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:00.220
But this seems like ridiculous looking for one.

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:02.860
And it's not the first time that someone's put out something like this

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:05.140
to try to capitalize on streaming there.

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.700
There's other devices, I think, from like Razer or Nvidia

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:12.180
or something like that, that were only streaming cloud streaming devices.

01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:13.940
But they worked with multiple platforms.

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.940
Like this worked for like, say,

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:18.660
for PlayStation five streaming.

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:24.820
It also worked for xCloud and whatever else, you know, like Nvidia's thing.

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:27.060
You know, that might be more worth it.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:31.620
But if it's just PlayStation five, it's $200.

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.660
That's ridiculous.

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:35.980
Well, even though Shane gave us a case where he would use it,

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.820
he does say in chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.500
Nope, it wouldn't be a success.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.820
And the form factor is ugly as all get out.

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.820
And I'm used to OLED on my mobile devices now, so that's a decent downgrade.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.180
Well, I mean, it's a it's a decent form factor,

01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.620
like if you were to put your own tablet in there or something like that.

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:56.860
Once again, they have I they literally sell this.

01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:03.940
That is a device that you can hook up to your phone or tablet, I think even.

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:05.820
And it works exactly like this.

01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:07.660
And you can just stream that way.

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.300
I mean, because I think even like streaming through mobile

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:15.620
or using like your mobile phone to do the cloud streaming with PlayStation,

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.300
you can use any controller with that.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.700
I don't think you're limited to just Sony controllers.

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.020
At least that's not the way it is with.

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.340
I think some of the other streaming services, so it would.

01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:28.300
Cool, cool that they're making this, who's this for?

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:31.860
I don't know, like, did they really test their markets with this?

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.300
I mean, it just doesn't seem like it makes sense.

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.540
Hopefully they end up in a bargain bin soon.

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:42.460
All right. Well, let's let's travel back to a simpler time in our next segment

01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:48.220
where maybe you don't have these devices that are portable,

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.980
but they're not actually portable at all.

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:52.780
I have no idea how else to a tangent into this segment.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.340
So we're just going to roll the bumper.

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:08.780
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.220
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.340
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:20.900
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight for the classic game of the week?

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:24.540
I picked a game that when it was first announced,

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:28.540
I super, super, super wanted to play the full version of it.

01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:32.740
And they had one at California Extreme two weeks ago.

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:36.500
So I'm finally doing F355 Challenge.

01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:42.220
It is a racing simulation arcade game

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:48.460
that's based off of the car and the official Ferrari challenge.

01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:53.700
It was developed by AM2 of Sega for the Sega Naomi multiboard

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:58.180
arcade system board, and it was directed by Yu Suzuki

01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:02.500
and was later ported over to the Dreamcast and PlayStation two.

01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:09.380
The Dreamcast one was called F355 Challenge

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:15.180
Passione Rossa and PlayStation two was Ferrari F355 Challenge

01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:19.060
for the American and European markets.

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:25.740
The only model of a car in the game is a Ferrari F355,

01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:28.100
which is, of course, from the challenge itself.

01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:35.580
And it was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 at that time.

01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:41.140
Some of the arcade cabinets, there's some different builds of them.

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:45.420
The one that I was most interested in was the three screen model,

01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:49.980
which now, you know, you'd hardly see a home sim racing rig

01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:53.060
that doesn't have a three screen dance had a three screen.

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:59.300
But it also has an eight

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:06.340
shaped gear shift and three foot pedals, and it's

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:09.780
I've played it now, of course,

01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:13.300
but it basically is as close to its time

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:15.940
in arcade simulation of being in a Ferrari as you could get.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:20.540
It was composed of four Naomi units,

01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:23.380
one for each of the screens and one to sync them.

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:29.140
The game does have automatic transition and pedal shift gears.

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.980
Another notable thing about it is that it uses the magic weather system

01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:37.100
that was similar to what eventually came out in Shinmu as well.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.500
And for the Dreamcast version, it has link cable play

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:44.020
that you can so you can play directly with other people.

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:51.940
But as of 2006, the online servers for F355 challenge are offline.

01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:52.940
In fact, the website's gone.

01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:55.820
Soundtrack is pretty, pretty good.

01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.980
It was supposed to sound like sort of 80s, you know, heavy metal,

01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:03.940
but it was put in the way like a radio station would be kind of outrun like,

01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:09.700
you know, and the music was done by Genki Hitomi and Minoru Nihara.

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:16.100
And it even had it's a radio announcer that was played by Alan Jay,

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:20.860
who is an American DJ who works for Bay FM

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.940
in Chiba in Japan.

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:31.860
So there were different circuits in there for the arcade version.

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:35.860
You had the Motegi Oval Circuit,

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:42.780
which is a motorsport venue in Motegi, Tochigi Prefecture.

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:45.180
It was originally called Twin Ring Motegi.

01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:49.700
And then you have the two Suzuka tracks.

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:51.700
And yes, it's that Suzuka.

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:59.020
It is the short configuration and the full configuration.

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:06.460
There is the Monza, which is actually north of Milan in Italy.

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.180
And this is the 1998 configuration.

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:14.860
There is a Sugo as in Sportsland Sugo,

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:18.940
which is a motorsports facility in Murata, Shibata district.

01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:24.540
There's also the Grand Prix of Long Beach.

01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.580
It's an IndyCar series race,

01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:30.580
but they use the track for that, the Long Beach track.

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:36.300
The home console versions also had five extra unlockable circuits.

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:40.220
There was the Atlanta Motor Speedway,

01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:45.260
as in the Hampton, Georgia version.

01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:49.660
There's Nurburgring,

01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:52.420
which, of course, you can't have a racing game without Nurburgring.

01:40:53.420 --> 01:41:00.420
Laguna Seca, which is one in central California around Monterey, I believe.

01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:05.860
There's Seppang, which is a Malaysian track.

01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:11.380
And then there's Fiorano, which the special thing about Fiorano

01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:14.140
is that it is the private

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:18.060
racetrack that's owned by Ferrari for development and testing.

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:25.500
So, yeah, you can unlock those by either finishing in certain positions

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.500
in a certain race or championship

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:32.060
or driving over a certain cumulative distance in the race

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.660
or by entering a password.

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.780
The tracks are also included in F355 Challenge 2

01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:43.660
International Course Edition arcade machine that came out in 2001.

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:47.540
This game was announced at E3 2000.

01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:54.700
The reception was kind of mixed.

01:41:55.500 --> 01:42:02.700
So, Pasha and Rosa, which was the Dreamcast one, got really favorable reviews,

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:06.220
but the PlayStation 2 one got average reviews.

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:12.580
Basically, we're saying that it's pretty eye candy

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:17.860
and very, very dedicated to Ferrari fans.

01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:24.380
For the console version, Famitsu gave it 29 out of 40

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:27.980
for the Dreamcast and 27 out of 40 for PlayStation.

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:30.980
The arcade version

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:37.900
in Japan, Game Machine listed it in their January 1st 2000 issue

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:41.900
as the seventh most successful dedicated arcade game of the past year.

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:47.020
And the arcade version also won the award for Coin Op of the Year

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.820
at EDGE Awards 2000.

01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:54.460
And Pasha and Rosa was the runner up in GameSpot's best driving game.

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:58.420
The first one, by the way, the winner was Test Drive Le Mans.

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:02.940
And at the fourth annual Interactive Achievement Awards,

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:07.100
the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:12.060
nominated F355 Challenge for the console racing award,

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:14.700
although SSX won it that year.

01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:21.260
But overall, the the arcade version just got all kinds of accolades.

01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.820
And for the home version,

01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:28.060
the Dreamcast fared much better than the PlayStation 2.

01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:32.180
Of course, if you think about it, Dreamcast is a home now, me.

01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:36.340
So, yeah. And that's it.

01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:40.100
All right. Oh, that's the Suzuka track right there.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:43.060
Yeah, this is you know what this game kind of reminds me of?

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:45.940
Number one, I love the billboards for Pocari Sweat.

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.980
That is definitely something I love.

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.220
Dan's gotten addicted to that, by the way.

01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:56.140
But also, I love this really reminds me of like a modern day poll.

01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:58.780
Well, I say modern day, even though it's 2001.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:02.940
But like poll position, you know, like, I don't know what it is,

01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:05.020
but it just gives me those big poll position vibes,

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.100
maybe because it's simplistic.

01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.100
And that's not a bad thing, because, you know, when you're driving fast cars,

01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:13.100
you oftentimes, you know, want to drive them.

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:14.900
You know, I don't know.

01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.300
It's just it kind of gives you a poll position vibes a little bit.

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:19.100
Yeah, no, for sure.

01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:22.020
Oh, and one other thing that I should mention, the music in the game,

01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.500
some of it found its way into Shenmue.

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:26.260
Oh, that's fun.

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.620
I mean, they're both AM2 games.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.660
So I guess it makes sense.

01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:32.980
All right. Awesome. Awesome.

01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:36.380
All right. Well, we have a few more things for you guys.

01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.660
We're going to invite your phone calls here in a little while as well

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:42.140
on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:46.300
But first, some rapid fire quick headlines, and we'll start with Loki.

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:50.300
I think you're muted, Loki.

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:54.500
I think you maybe know if I hit the button and it didn't quite engage.

01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:57.220
OK, so this is kind of cool.

01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:03.740
So the Xbox Series X is going to be getting some brand new wraps.

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.860
And so these are kind of like skins for consoles,

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:11.580
but they're magnetic and kind of fold around it and are held in place by a magnet.

01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.700
So, of course, some of the first wraps that we're going to be getting

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:18.220
for the Xbox Series X are based around Starfield.

01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:23.100
And so they have a Starfield version, which is $49.99.

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:28.300
They also have a blue and white wrap that I think it was a camo.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:33.420
And that is for $44.99, a bit on the expensive side,

01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:35.220
but they are pretty cool looking.

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:39.020
And yeah, I have to see what other things they come out with.

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:43.500
But yeah, for sure, I want to get one for my console if it wasn't in a box.

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:52.500
The wraps are supposed to be coming out on October 18th, at least the Starfield one is.

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:56.420
And then the other wraps will launch November 10th.

01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:59.980
So and they're made out of vinyl.

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:03.020
This is kind of neat.

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:08.260
So, you know, everyone loves Half-Life 2 and Nvidia announced that there's going

01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:14.900
to be a Half-Life 2 RTX version, which is in early development right now.

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:20.060
But it's using their RTX remix platform to basically

01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:26.940
mod in higher definition models and ray tracing and all that stuff.

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:28.860
That's what they do with Portal not that long ago, right?

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.420
Right. Yeah.

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:33.900
So it makes sense that they're going to do the same with another source engine game.

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:39.540
So that is going to be coming at some point soon, I think.

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:40.740
Well, early development.

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:42.740
OK, maybe not so soon.

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.540
Eventually will be coming out some day.

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:50.500
Sooner, sooner than the, you know, the ray tracing update for Minecraft.

01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:52.500
Sooner than Elder Scrolls six.

01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:55.140
Much, yes.

01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:57.220
Dark Saga.

01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:05.900
Well, there are warnings coming with the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume One.

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:13.140
And it's a warning that we see on like older, you know, Looney Tunes cartoons and the like.

01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:15.900
I'll go ahead and read what it says.

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:20.020
This game contains expressions and themes which may be considered outdated.

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:24.660
However, these elements have been included without alteration to preserve the historical

01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.740
context in which the game was made and the creator's original vision.

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:30.020
Player discretion is advised.

01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:33.580
Of course, they said the same thing with Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection.

01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:37.940
So, I mean, I think it's just a cover your ass kind of thing.

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.340
I didn't know that there were going to be boobs in this game.

01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:44.580
I didn't know they were talking about war.

01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:47.980
How dare you push smoking.

01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:53.180
Yeah, and I don't remember those games that thoroughly, so I don't know what, quote unquote,

01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:57.140
you know, problematic things might have shown up in the game that don't.

01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:00.260
Walking in on Meryl in her underwear.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:03.900
Maybe or just things that don't look good in 2023.

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.460
You know, society's changed.

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:07.260
So it is what it is. Yeah.

01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:13.820
I mean, a similar warning that should be on old episodes of the show, quite frankly, you know,

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:18.900
it's that the humor 20 years ago is different than the humor now, and, you know, it's what it is.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.580
So. Yep.

01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:28.660
All right. One other, you know, this classic hasn't changed at all is Excite Bike 64.

01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:33.780
That's right. Excite Bike 64 is on its way to Nintendo Switch online on August 30th.

01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:39.860
So later this week, this is it's nice to hear about games getting added to Nintendo Switch online again.

01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:42.380
I guess opening up these new platforms really did do something.

01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:48.900
But yeah, Excite Bike 64 is on its way out and that will be fun for those that remember that game fondly.

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:51.220
Sorry, Loki. No word about Excite Truck.

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:52.900
I guess it's all right.

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.700
They're not the Wii games yet.

01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:57.180
Once they start doing Wii games, they'll be one of the first ones.

01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:01.060
I'm pretty sure because it's surely, you know, it's got to be.

01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:03.660
And then they'll be glorious times again.

01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:07.780
Except they'll do Excite Bots trick racing instead.

01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:12.540
And everyone will be like, Oh, that's not what I meant.

01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.940
I mean, not like this.

01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.300
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:21.500
and some things that are coming out sooner than Wii games on Nintendo Switch.

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:22.980
What's coming out in the US this week?

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.180
Loki, we have a few things.

01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:29.740
So we have Crossfire Sierra Squad on PC and PlayStation five.

01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:34.700
Goodbye, Volcano High on PC, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:40.700

PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:03.740
Daymare are I guess it's like nightmare, but Daymare 1994 Sandcastle.

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:07.220
That is quite the collection of words and numbers there.

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:12.300
That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:17.380
The big con on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:21.420
Oi on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.620
Somerville on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.700
Taito Milestones two on Nintendo Switch.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:36.900
Tenebrous Pictura on PC and PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:45.620
Trine five, A Clockwork Conspiracy on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:50.860
War Hospital on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:57.500
Bomb Rush Cyber Funk on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:59.500
Yeah, that looks awesome.

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:06.660
Mega Man X Divine Offline on PC, iOS and Android.

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:10.260
Rhapsody, Moral Kingdom Chronicles.

01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:12.340
That's going to be for Europe, actually.

01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:14.580
So I'm not going to we're not going to talk about that one right now.

01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:16.180
That's coming out earlier in the week.

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.460
And that's it.

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:22.300
All right, well, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.940
We have a little bit going on this week.

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:29.540
So on the Nintendo Switch on August 30th, Samba de Amigo Party Central is also out in Japan this week.

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:35.980
We also have The Legend of the Legend of Heroes, Zero no Kisuke Kai and Ao no Kisuke Kai.

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:39.380
I believe these are older games that are being remastered.

01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:44.540
I think they're about 10 years old now, but they're being remastered with full voice acting and being released for the Switch.

01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:46.020
So that's pretty cool.

01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:51.940
We also have on the 31st, Taito Milestones 2, another kind of retro game collection.

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:57.780
And I was looking at what games were in this and they have like Kiki Kai Kai, Dino Rex.

01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:01.900
There's some but they also have like The Legend of Kage, the New Zealand story.

01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:06.060
So there's some other, you know, a kind of New Zealand story is so cute.

01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:09.740
Yeah. So this is a very interesting this is a deep dive collection, but it looks pretty cool.

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:11.700
So that is out on the Nintendo Switch this week.

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.860
And then that is apparently also a US release.

01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:18.380
I didn't catch that, but I'm noticing that is out too.

01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:19.700
So maybe I'll pick that up.

01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:23.660
I don't know. And then Moving Out 2 is also out on the Switch.

01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:24.940
Those are just Switch releases.

01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.900
Let's check out the PlayStation 5 on the PlayStation 5.

01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:30.700
This week we have Edge of Eternity is out this week.

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:41.660
That same Daymare 1994 Sandcastle that Loki was referring to earlier is also out on PlayStation 5 and Moving Out 2 also released on PlayStation 5.

01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:43.420
And those are your Japanese releases.

01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:45.980
Let's get over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:57.180
So on the 29th of August on Xbox, we have Smurfs Kart for Xbox and PlayStation Under the Waves.

01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:00.300
On the 29th for Switch, we have Samba de Amigo.

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:07.740
Also for Switch, Xbox and PlayStation, we have Agatha Christie Hercule-Perot, The London Case.

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:19.380
On the 30th on PlayStation, Daymare 1994 Sandcastle, we have for everything practically on the 31st, we have Trine 5, A Clockwork Conspiracy.

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.540
September 1st, we have Disney Lorkana.

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:26.780
Also, Starfield Constellation Edition.

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:29.500
And that's going to be it for the week.

01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:33.060
Also, that's my wedding anniversary of 18 years.

01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.780
Aw, congrats.

01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:37.300
Thanks. I haven't killed him yet.

01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.700
There's still time. I'm just kidding.

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:41.860
No, he's I love my boy.

01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:50.740
Well, there's still time for that, but we are out of time with Dark Sakura tonight, as I believe you have one more night of early obligations tomorrow.

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:54.940
So but you'll be back with us full time when we return in two weeks.

01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:01.580
So I'll float around in chat for a little bit, but I got to do a lot of winding down before before bedtime.

01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.380
So let me see if I can get my thing to do the hearts.

01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:06.860
Come on, get up your hand.

01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:10.100
There we go. Hearts.

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:13.260
Well, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:16.540
I hate getting up any time before 12.

01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:18.940
OK, maybe 10.

01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:21.900
All right, we'll see you in two weeks.

01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.020
Oh, don't forget, I'm going to be all day Sunday.

01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.740
All right, come play with me.

01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:31.260
Check it out. Keep me coming.

01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:33.540
I can't. I'm busy.

01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:36.620
You can keep it open on your phone.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.780
All right. Bye, everybody.

01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:41.700
Take care. Have fun storming the castle.

01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:44.620
That's basically what Dragon Con is.

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.220
It's storming the castle, except the castle is five hotels.

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:49.620
It's what it is. All right.

01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:50.940
Hi. All right.

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:52.540
Let's go back to Loki.

01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:55.180
Loki, you have some headlines for us.

01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:58.500
Yeah. So about the GTA six leaker

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:04.500
who apparently hacks Broxer with just an Amazon fire stick in a hotel room, they say.

01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.940
So there is some apparently the

01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:11.540
BBC report had some details

01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:15.180
regarding court documents that are filed in U.K.

01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:17.780
talking about 18 year old Arianne

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:22.380
Kurtage, who said was was caught red handed

01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:25.460
when police searched his hotel room.

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:29.780
And he's being held on bail because, you know, he was arrested

01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:32.340
for hacking Nvidia as well.

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:36.740
He'd claimed to have downloaded all of GTA six's data

01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:39.420
and that he was going to release the source code less.

01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:42.740
Rockstar Games messaged him on telegram

01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:46.060
and I assume paid him money as well.

01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:52.340
But yeah, apparently he was part of a hacker group as well called lapses.

01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:57.140
And I'm not sure how he used the Amazon fire stick

01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:00.140
necessarily to hack somebody, but

01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:03.980
somebody, but well, they probably don't want other people to do it,

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:06.500
so they're probably keeping it a little bit vague.

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:07.740
Right. Yeah, exactly.

01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:11.500
It could be a key logger or something like that or who knows? I don't know.

01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:13.260
But you never know.

01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:15.500
Chat says, wow, that's a lot of laws being broken.

01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.980
It sure is. It sure is.

01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:20.860
Well, you know, if you're breaking the law, break in the story in the news,

01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:23.220
the laws. Yeah. Yeah.

01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:25.460
It's especially like interesting, like you're a hacksmith.

01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:26.260
You're like, oh, yeah.

01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.780
And and I'm going to get you the payment to not leak your stuff.

01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:32.860
Yeah, that's that's worked out great for everybody that's done that.

01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:37.060
Like, nobody has ever not gotten away from that like that.

01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:41.020
Just like 100 percent of the time you're going to get caught

01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:43.660
because you're just basically saying, Hey, it was me. I did it.

01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.620
Hey, it's me. You know, like.

01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:46.980
I did.

01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:50.340
Rama Esten chat points out you can sideload a terminal app into a fire stick.

01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.420
Yeah, I mean, it can be done.

01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:55.140
It's just it's yeah, it's just a little surprising, I guess, maybe.

01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:59.180
Yeah. So, well, it's been caught.

01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:01.700
Rockstar is going to get, you know,

01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:05.340
I didn't realize it was the same person that did this and the Nvidia one,

01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.500
because, you know, that one, it was a while ago, but it's still,

01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:11.740
you know, pretty much everything in that ended up being announced,

01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.700
except for the tactics.

01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:15.700
Redo is still something that was in that.

01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:17.420
I think there might be one or two others.

01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.980
And some may be coming. Yeah, it could be.

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.980
What else? I think you have one other thing for us, right?

01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:28.500
Yeah. So Bioware is going to be cutting around 50 jobs.

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:32.660
They're saying to help the studio become more agile and more focused.

01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:36.180
They said after much consideration and careful playing,

01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:39.660
we have built a long term vision that will preserve the health of the studio

01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:43.460
and better enable us to do what we do best, create exceptional story

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.700
driven single player experiences, blah, blah, blah.

01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:50.380
And basically saying, you know, commit that the

01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:53.460
they're committing to supporting the affected staff.

01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:57.180
We've chosen to act now in part to provide our impacted colleagues

01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:00.180
with the many opportunities as possible.

01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:03.620
I don't know if it's necessarily like I don't know where they cut jobs

01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:06.300
necessarily with that.

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:08.500
Maybe it's just

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:12.020
that lay off money or people for

01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:15.900
projects or overlapping types of things that they're doing.

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:18.100
There were some reorganization stuff.

01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.300
So that sucks when people are impacted by that stuff. But.

01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:26.260
Yeah, it's I mean, I know they were offering

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:29.620
to relocate people within EA, and I guess, you know, that's, you know,

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:32.220
I guess the least they could do in that type of situation.

01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:37.020
But I see. OK, so they were several EA sever ties with a studio

01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:39.380
that was working on Dragon Age Dread Wolf.

01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:42.220
So I'm guessing it's from that studio then.

01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.900
Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:48.940
Shane in chat says no faith in Bioware writing after DA for

01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:51.300
since I assume that the writing is finished by now.

01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:55.500
They let go some really senior writers that went all the way back to Baldur's Gate

01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:57.780
and original Dragon Age of Mass Effect.

01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:02.780
I'm actually curious who they did let go because I really didn't know.

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:07.460
And my initial thought, based on what they're saying in the commitment

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:10.300
and all that stuff, was that they talked a lot about single player.

01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:15.420
And I was wondering, did they take multiplayer out of the games coming up?

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:19.460
But it's weird because I thought multiplayer was such a bread and butter for EA

01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:20.940
like that was really.

01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:23.460
But then also now you have Baldur's Gate three

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:27.100
has really changed like the whole speaking on.

01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.660
You know what? This is what a fully featured game should look like.

01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:31.820
Although I would say that game is too new.

01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:35.420
Like this layoff has been in process well before Baldur's Gate

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:38.460
three impacted the equation, but it still is interesting.

01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:42.420
But maybe they're they're trying to like back away from multiplayer

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:44.100
after the whole anthem thing.

01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:45.420
So that was my original thought.

01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:48.500
But now we're hearing that it's right because Quest Buster in chat says

01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:51.580
one of the senior writers, Mary Kirby, was let go.

01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:55.700
She was responsible for characters like Barrick from Dragon Age two.

01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:58.020
Kirby was with Bioware since 2006.

01:59:58.260 --> 02:00:00.820
So they're letting writers go?

02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:03.780
We got chat, JPT, chat, JPT, we'll just write all the lines.

02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:06.140
It'll be fine. Don't fucking start.

02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:10.500
We've trained chat, JPT on all of her previous works or wherever,

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:14.100
all their works, and I'm sure it'll be it'll do a bang up job

02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:16.980
getting that dialogue correct.

02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:19.260
Sorry, I'm going to barf on air.

02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.020
Um, disgusting.

02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:24.700
Yeah, I just.

02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:30.580
I is it one of those things where like the new Mass Effect is all already

02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:33.660
written as well, and this studio is like, well, we're going to not be

02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:37.020
able to get that game out for another seven years, so we've pretty much

02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:38.700
got our like 10 year plan now.

02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:41.340
So, you know, I don't it's it's wild.

02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:45.740
Shane and chat says you won't recognize the names probably, but some people

02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:48.180
that wrote some really fantastic characters.

02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:51.580
The original Canaan writer is gone now, but he was written by another

02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:52.780
person for Mass Effect three.

02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:54.580
Wow. That's some.

02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:56.740
Why the right.

02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:01.220
I mean, I God, what you said made me like physically ill, but I

02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:04.100
I worry in a boardroom type set up.

02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.540
There's people that might actually think that

02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:11.620
because it's what you see happening with the strike right now, right?

02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:14.460
Like there's they want to replace.

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:18.340
Yeah, they want to replace I background actors and writers.

02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:19.980
Good for them standing their ground.

02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:21.180
Fuck. Fuck all.

02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:24.660
I mean, you can try good.

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:26.500
You'll see how that ends up.

02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:29.740
It's not it's nowhere near ready to do that.

02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:34.260
But you can certainly think that it can and fail. But.

02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:36.460
I don't know.

02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:39.340
Shane says the new Mass Effect is like helmed by the writer

02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:41.460
of Guardians of the Galaxy, so I already have little faith.

02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:43.300
The movie or the game?

02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.020
Because the game was actually it was good.

02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:47.700
The game was actually pretty good. So.

02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:51.460
Yeah, Questmaster says,

02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:55.300
also worried about the writing quality and Dread Wolf now, if it is locked down,

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.460
they might have let them go for new projects.

02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:59.660
But who knows what that means going forward?

02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:01.980
Who will be writing for any future titles after D.A.

02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:05.100
for or a new Mass Effect or like DLC?

02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:09.700
You know, unless that's all locked and loaded, too. I don't know. So.

02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:14.140
Anyway, it's it's very sad to hear about.

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:18.420
And now that I understand it's writers, that's that's a huge concern.

02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:22.420
I was walking into this thinking, well, we didn't really know who it was yet.

02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:24.540
Maybe the multiplayer or maybe, you know, again,

02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:29.380
now I'm really worried that I'm hearing that. That's.

02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:33.980
And it's weird to think that Baldur's Gate was a Bioware game.

02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:36.740
Remember that Baldur's Gate was a Bioware game.

02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:40.580
I don't know.

02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:44.500
I don't know the new.

02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:46.300
Hey, you know, I'm still rooting for him.

02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:47.940
I want the new Dragon Age to be good.

02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:50.900
I want the new Mass Effect to be good. But if they're not.

02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:55.900
Moving on to the next story.

02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:59.140
Exactly. We just have to.

02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:03.420
Hey, Loki, I don't know if you're thinking about the next game

02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:05.420
you'll work on after Pixel Poops, too.

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:08.300
I mean, I think you're too busy making videos to think about a new game.

02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:12.140
But if if you ever were to make a new game, something to think about

02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.820
is a new deal from the Epic Game Store.

02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:18.100
100 percent of net revenue

02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:22.700
if you give them six months exclusive to your game.

02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:26.340
It's a new program that the Epic Store is running called the Epic

02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:28.100
First Run program.

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:30.300
It is for games and apps.

02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:33.420
And if you make them exclusive to Epic, you'll get, like I said,

02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:37.180
100 percent of net revenue after that window ends.

02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:40.580
You're going down to 88 percent of revenue because you might remember

02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:43.740
Epic kind of tried to mix that up a little while ago

02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:46.260
where the standard is usually about 30 percent.

02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.540
And Epic took that down to 12 percent.

02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:51.460
So now they're trying to entice you with 100 percent.

02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:57.740
The net revenue means you don't get things like taxes, refunds.

02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:00.260
Epic does cover payment processing and all that stuff, though.

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:04.740
They're saying that if you participate in this program,

02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:07.060
you can get your stuff in front of more eyes.

02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:10.820
The games and app get exclusive badging and spots on the home page.

02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:14.340
So, yeah, this is going to be open to developers and publishers

02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:18.340
who are releasing products on or after October 16th.

02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:21.700
It is eligible if it has not appeared on another PC store

02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:25.260
or subscription service on those storefronts.

02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:29.660
If you already have an exclusive deal with Epic, you're not eligible for this.

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:31.020
So this is a new program.

02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:34.020
Otherwise, it's interesting.

02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:37.460
But can I can I say something very real and honest about the epic store?

02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:41.380
I think they need to work on making that store interesting

02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:44.180
because it's it's not a very interesting storefront.

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:47.580
It's a very boring storefront, quite honestly.

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:52.100
And the only reason I usually sign into Epic Games is either one,

02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:55.260
they got an exclusive dammit or two.

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.300
They're giving away free games.

02:04:57.300 --> 02:04:59.460
And I want to go claim those free games.

02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:02.140
That's it. And even now, the free games are starting to repeat again.

02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:03.020
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:03.860
I've already got more off.

02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:05.260
There's rumors are going away, too.

02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:10.460
So I but I just think the store itself is kind of ugly, to be quite honest.

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:13.660
And I think the product that Epic's putting out there is not

02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:15.780
quite as robust as steam.

02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:18.100
I mean. Don't get me wrong.

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:20.580
I think steam is kind of rested on it for a little while.

02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.380
But I've noticed like just in the past year, year and a half,

02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:26.420
especially with the more recent redesign, they tried to.

02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:29.060
I kind of figured that was all tied to the steam deck.

02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:32.100
But whatever the reason, I feel like steam at least looks a little.

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:37.460
Neater these days, but I just I find the epic store so fucking boring to be.

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:39.700
Yeah. I mean, if they get rid of the free games,

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:43.060
I mean, no one's going to log into that thing unless they're getting

02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:44.340
an exclusive game.

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:47.180
And even then, you're just they're paying for that exclusivity.

02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:51.540
It's like people default to steam because it's just the place

02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:53.780
that where everything is, like I have a huge library there.

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:58.300
And honestly, I have a pretty decent library in epic, but I buy most of that.

02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:03.740
Yeah. And yeah, I'm fine with not logging into it.

02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:08.900
Loki, if you were to ever release a new game with this temp to.

02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:11.420
A 100 percent deal.

02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:13.500
Whatever. I mean, it's not going to hurt anything, I don't think.

02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:16.980
I don't I wouldn't sell much anyways.

02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:19.820
I know. I was going to say, are you saying 100 percent of zero is still zero?

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:23.020
Yes, I mean, kind of, you know.

02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:26.260
By the way, go buy Pixel Poops two on steam.

02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:27.460
It is available.

02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:29.380
And the original Pixel Poops is free.

02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:32.940
But you can check out some of the rad DLC via the ever hard working.

02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:37.860
Why? Why are we always always like to plug our hard working friend, Aaron?

02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:40.380
So. All right.

02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:43.100
But that was the now dark to see us as to be fair.

02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:44.340
I bought Pixel Poops, too.

02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.780
I think it was on itch.io.

02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:49.340
And actually, technically, I think Loki gets a slightly bigger cut

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:52.500
when you do that. So that's it doesn't matter at this point.

02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:55.380
Like I'm almost like willing to tell Aaron just like.

02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:59.100
Just keep the money and it like doesn't really matter.

02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:01.980
Like we sell so few copies of it ever.

02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:04.180
Like it just doesn't even matter anymore.

02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:05.780
Going to make it free at some point.

02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:07.820
I don't know when, but like not yet.

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.340
I want to get the physical version out at some point.

02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:11.460
I think that would be really cool.

02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.340
But that's a lot of work for like not a lot of return.

02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:15.700
I have so rare.

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:17.100
I have something very rare.

02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:19.100
I know. I know you have one of them.

02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:21.220
Like one of the twelve that have been out there.

02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:23.420
I never did get Jamie's is still sitting here.

02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:27.980
So it gave one to one YouTuber guy,

02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:29.900
but I gave one to him.

02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:31.580
He never played it.

02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:33.940
At least I didn't see a video on it.

02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:35.940
So it's cool.

02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:37.700
But you got there.

02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:38.820
I did get a magazine.

02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:41.540
Still have a whole bunch of them in, you know, sealed.

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:44.460
That's still I've got like five, six copies of that magazine.

02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:46.380
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:48.460
All right. Well, this is the part of the show

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.260
where we're going to open it up for any questions.

02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:51.940
Also in a museum.

02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:55.900
Member in the game museum or whatever, that's wild.

02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:59.660
I'm going to open it up to your calls

02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:02.140
if you want to give us a call over at Vogue Network dot com.

02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:04.220
That's VOG Network dot com slash discord.

02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:07.620
You can join our green room and we'll take a call or two from there

02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:09.740
if anybody is so inclined.

02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:12.700
Also, I would invite you to join our discord to chat with us throughout the week.

02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:14.980
Oftentimes we chat with our listeners

02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:17.900
throughout the week about certain news that's happening.

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.260
In fact, many listeners brought to my attention this week

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.380
that Bob Barker passed away this week.

02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:27.420
As you many of you know, at this point at the age of ninety nine,

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.660
which is is sad, but it's also one of those things where it's like

02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.460
you live to be ninety nine.

02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:34.500
That's a really good life.

02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:36.900
And where you get to that point where it's like, OK, this is

02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:39.180
this is we're celebrating and let's look back on that.

02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:42.740
So, you know, we talk about things that aren't just video games as well.

02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:47.220
So check that out over on our discord server over at Vogue Network

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:49.380
dot com slash discord.

02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:51.060
I'll also open it up to any.

02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:57.820
Comments and questions in chat that you have for us over at Vogue Network on Twitch.

02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:02.900
And then also I would read emails participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:07.300
But I just looked in the inbox and unfortunately is empty.

02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:09.500
That's sad.

02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:13.300
Participate at Orange Laundry dot com if you want to change it up for a future week.

02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:15.380
We are also available on socials.

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:18.020
We are on Twitter because I'm not calling it the other thing

02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:21.900
at not just VOG Network, but we're on Twitter at OLR.

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:26.780
If you want to follow Vogue Network on Blue Sky, you can at Vogue Network dot com.

02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:29.540
And because you can actually have a domain name there on Blue Sky.

02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:30.420
So check that out.

02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:33.620
We are also expanding our presence on other socials as well,

02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:36.660
including TikTok I mentioned earlier.

02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:42.700
We're also YouTube is a big push for us lately over at a YouTube Vogue Network.

02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:44.340
So just look up VOG Network.

02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:46.460
You're probably going to find us in all the socials.

02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:50.020
Yeah, in chat, as we mentioned, I saw this plenty of times as well.

02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:54.660
Tiger Claw mentions that Arlene Sorkin, the original voice of Harley Quinn,

02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:58.900
also passed away, who I believed also played an inspirational character

02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:03.500
for Harley Quinn, the animated version, anyway, in Days of Our Lives,

02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:05.300
where she kind of was originally started.

02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:09.740
So I know the animated world really, you know, especially

02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:13.580
with some of the other recent losses in the voice acting world.

02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.660
It's very, very unfortunate.

02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:20.700
SSG100Matt says, Rob, so what are you most looking forward

02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:23.140
to doing at Dragon Con aside from your panels?

02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:26.900
Well, we answered that in a video, which is available on our YouTube

02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:29.660
over at Vogue Network, but I'll give it a serious answer.

02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:35.620
I'm looking forward to this going to be Alan's first Dragon Con,

02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:38.340
so I'm hoping it's going to be a little bit like Disneyland,

02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:40.140
where you still have some of the magic

02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:42.580
seeing it through somebody's eyes for the first time.

02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:45.540
I think that'll be a lot of fun and you need to take him around to do things.

02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:49.780
I like getting to see people is always good

02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:51.900
and one of the most important parts.

02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:54.780
And for those that have watched the TikTok

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:57.340
that we did in the quick two minutes we had on there,

02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:00.700
you'll notice that's something we mentioned.

02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:03.900
Shane in chat says, Rob is most looking forward

02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:06.220
to the days of constant COVID testing afterward.

02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:08.180
I know it's a risk I'm taking.

02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:11.980
Now, I do plan to wear a mask at Dragon Con

02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:14.740
when like not in my hotel room or speaking on a panel.

02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:17.700
To try to lessen the chances of that.

02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.540
But I know it's a risk I'm taking.

02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:24.740
But there comes a point where you weigh the risk of that

02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:29.260
and the risk of not taking these opportunities

02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:33.900
that are literally once in a lifetime in some places and like getting on them.

02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:34.980
So I'm doing everything I need to do.

02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:38.260
I'm not going to be seeing anybody after I get back.

02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.940
And yeah, I'll test. It's fine.

02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:45.540
So I'm measuring everything with it.

02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:46.940
That's all.

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.660
Phil of nine in chat says,

02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:52.300
just don't let anyone with hot breath get in your face.

02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.900
I don't plan to.

02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:59.580
So in Dragon Con 2021, the year I wore a mask, I was fine.

02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:03.580
It was last year I didn't wear a mask because nobody did.

02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:06.740
And I also had had COVID three months earlier.

02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:08.700
And I was like, oh, I can't get it again that quick.

02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:10.460
And I was wrong.

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:13.100
So change it up a little bit this year.

02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:20.900
So pod culture in chat says got to meet Alan at some point.

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:22.100
Well, he's going to be there.

02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:24.220
So you know where to find me.

02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:26.020
I'm sure we'll run into you at some point.

02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:31.060
But also the well, I can't guarantee Alan will be at all my panels.

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:32.620
But you know what is funny?

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:35.220
So Alan downloaded the app.

02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:38.780
I would say this is the panel to try to attend, if any of them.

02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:44.740
And because Alan actually brought up the app and he was like, yeah,

02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:46.220
I was kind of looking at the programming.

02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:49.460
He was like, I actually was going through the panels and I was like,

02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:51.180
oh, this one sounds interesting.

02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:55.420
And when I marked it, I realized it was the panel you and Bobby are doing.

02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:00.620
And it was it was the it's a panel called How Do You Do Fellow Kids

02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:03.300
Thriving on Streaming Media After the Age of 40.

02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:05.780
And so Alan saw that and was like, oh, that speaks to me.

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:07.460
And he actually bookmarked it.

02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:11.700
But that that's funny to me, because that actually makes me go, oh,

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:14.580
maybe it's working for other people too.

02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:17.700
Then if Alan like didn't remember that that was the thing we had proposed

02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:22.020
and he actually found it on his own and wanted to do it, maybe.

02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:27.900
Rama in chat says, Rob, is there a possibility of a surprise stream

02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:31.620
of y'all in the hotel room with a bottle of fireball on Discord?

02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:35.860
So when you involve alcohol, things get a little dicey

02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:38.580
with some of the terms of service.

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:41.660
Like, I know you can do it on Twitch as long as that isn't

02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.500
the focal point of your stream.

02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:47.820
I'm not 100 percent sure what the rules are on TikTok, but either way,

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:51.100
we're not planning on any streams.

02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:54.820
And I don't think you should, you know, put a lot of stock in that.

02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:58.380
But might we do some more short videos

02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:01.300
and things now that we're kind of dipping the toes into that?

02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:03.380
I think that's something we'll be doing.

02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:07.380
So keep an eye out on the socials for all of that, for sure.

02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:11.500
And we'll absolutely do a wrap up show when we're back

02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:15.900
and talk about some of that as we continue to expand our YouTube presence, for sure.

02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:20.300
So Shane in chat says, stupid Pokemon Go.

02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:22.420
Twitter is teasing my gay peacock.

02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:25.100
That's Quaxley's final evolution.

02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:26.380
I forget the name.

02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:27.540
They know how to get me.

02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:29.900
So I did Pokemon Go this weekend.

02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:32.260
I actually I got 15,000 steps yesterday.

02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:34.780
But here's I didn't pay I didn't pay for the event.

02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:39.940
I don't want to get too into it because I just didn't want to make a scene

02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:43.180
of it in this week's show, but like I'm really, really mad

02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:45.420
at something that happened in Ingress, like really mad.

02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:49.740
So I'm canceling my sub and I don't really plan to play Ingress

02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:52.180
outside of some things that I've committed to for my team.

02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:57.580
Pretty much past those things that are a couple of months out, that's it.

02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:59.780
I'm pretty much done with Ingress at this point,

02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:02.380
unless there are some serious things that change.

02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:06.140
And so it's actually kind of made me not want to play anything Niantic,

02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:09.060
but I'm kind of having to weigh that whole.

02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:14.900
Recognizing my issues and recognizing

02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:20.580
maybe I still need some gamification for my own health.

02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:24.500
And so I allowed myself to the compromise, quote unquote,

02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:27.580
I made is that I'll play play Pokemon and Pikmin,

02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:29.420
but I'm not giving them any more money.

02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:32.980
So I didn't buy the ticket.

02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:38.180
And to be honest, you know, it wasn't anything.

02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:44.220
Like it wasn't anything special that they were offering.

02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:47.980
It was a fifteen dollar ticket for some more shinies.

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:50.940
Bobby, can I read that on air?

02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:54.740
It was a fifteen dollar ticket for some shinies and like

02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:59.180
some unknowns of which there's only one I was missing.

02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:03.540
The M and one of my friends caught the M for me.

02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:08.060
OK, so I was going to let Bobby say why he was gone tonight,

02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:11.420
because it's his business, but he just appeared again in chat

02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:15.460
and gave us permission to tell you all that he was in the E.R.

02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:18.900
and his show was canceled by a three millimeter kidney stone,

02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:20.660
which should pass tomorrow.

02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:24.900
So and I'm sure Loki can tell you kidney stones fucking suck.

02:16:24.900 --> 02:16:26.900
So sorry to hear that they do.

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:28.340
Sorry to hear that that happened to you, Bobby.

02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:31.260
But on the other hand, with that kind of pain,

02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:35.660
I'm actually really happy to hear when you say should pass tomorrow.

02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:38.740
I'm like super happy to hear it's like super treatable.

02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:41.220
And we're not talking about like a surgery or something,

02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:44.140
because there was a part of me and I'm sure you were thinking it, too,

02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:48.500
that was like, oh, no, is his Dragon Con going to get like,

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:50.580
because I know this is a big deal for Bobby, too.

02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:51.380
It's like that.

02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:54.460
This is like the one week a year you get to be immature as fuck,

02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:56.460
but also mature when doing panels.

02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:59.140
But then, you know, doing the, you know, drinking a board game place.

02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:00.300
I was a little worried for those.

02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:03.940
Oh, that's so I was hoping I was actually hoping like, OK,

02:17:04.140 --> 02:17:09.660
kidney stone sound waves passing it done by Wednesday, Thursday.

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:10.220
And we're good.

02:17:10.220 --> 02:17:11.780
So it sounds like that is the case.

02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:13.580
I'm very happy to hear it,

02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:15.660
although I'm not happy to hear it happened.

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:19.820
I'm just happy to hear it's got a resolution that'll be quick. So.

02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:25.100
Ah, as Joe and Matt says, I got three shinies the whole weekend.

02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:26.420
Didn't pay either.

02:17:26.420 --> 02:17:28.900
My expectations were low, but the rates of this event were trash.

02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:32.300
Shane was telling me that you only had the boosted rates if you paid.

02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:34.340
I got two shinies.

02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:36.660
I got one of the little Pikachu's with a crown.

02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:38.860
I don't remember which color. I think yellow, maybe red.

02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:41.140
I got one of the Pikachu's with a crown that shiny

02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:43.780
and I got a lowland Diglett randomly.

02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:46.940
That's it. I only got the two because I didn't play today.

02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:49.260
Really, it was it was a little too hot by the time I woke up.

02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:52.180
So that's all.

02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:54.100
All right. Well, that's it.

02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:56.500
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:17:56.700 --> 02:17:57.900
Before we wrap it up here,

02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:00.820
I will go around and get my final thoughts and do good night.

02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:05.140
But let me thank you all for taking the time out to listen to Orange Launch Radio.

02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:06.740
Thank you for listening live.

02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:11.180
If you were here at the Voice Geeks Network or if you were listening

02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:14.700
on our podcast feed, whether it be on Spotify, iTunes, wherever

02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:15.820
did you find podcasts?

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:18.740
Thank you so much for downloading the show and check checking it out.

02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:20.180
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:22.780
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:25.660
But we need more voices to put out here on air.

02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:29.140
Don't forget to follow follow Vogue Network on all of your favorite socials,

02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:31.860
including TikTok and YouTube, as well as here on Twitch.

02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:33.820
We really appreciate that as well.

02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:37.940
And yeah, as a reminder, we'll be back in two weeks.

02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:41.420
I really, really look forward to hoping to see some of you at Dragon Con.

02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:44.900
And again, as I was mentioning a moment ago, probably the best panel

02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:48.540
to catch would be the streaming over 40 panel.

02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:50.900
It's going to be a small room.

02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:53.260
Bobby, myself and Alan will all be there.

02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:57.420
So if you're wanting to meet folks that that would be I mean, I'm in the app

02:18:57.420 --> 02:18:59.260
and you can see other panels I'm doing as well.

02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:02.380
And plus, actually, I have extra ones that are on socials.

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:04.940
But I, I would say this.

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:09.620
The roast panel that I'm doing is not going to be good

02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:12.420
if you don't know the people as well.

02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:14.620
Like that sounds bad.

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:17.340
It's going to be funny, but it's I feel like a lot of jokes might

02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:21.180
like it's it's definitely for like the digital media people

02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:22.860
and people that actively participate in that.

02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:26.980
So I'm just saying, like, if you want to meet me, that's not the panel to do it.

02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:31.460
You could still I don't I'll still say hi, but I would urge you

02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:32.620
to pick one of the other panels.

02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:36.060
And probably the streaming over 40 is probably your best bet, to be honest.

02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:38.500
So and thank you, Questbuster. I appreciate it.

02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.060
I will have fun at Dragon Con.

02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:43.020
Loki, I hope you have fun next weekend, too, with the video production,

02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:45.380
all the other stuff that you're up to reviving your Twitch presence

02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:46.740
or whatever you do.

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:49.140
Do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:53.740
Yeah, just look out for my my new episode.

02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:55.060
Hopefully it'll be coming next week.

02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:57.460
It's a lot. Like I said, it's it's going to be longer.

02:19:57.460 --> 02:20:00.900
It's it's movie esque is very cinematic.

02:20:00.900 --> 02:20:03.180
So looking forward to having that done.

02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:04.260
Look forward to seeing it.

02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:06.820
And congrats. Congrats once again on your journey this week.

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:11.740
And even if it isn't a ton of exposure, you still got some exposure

02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:13.780
and some exposure is better than nothing.

02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:15.780
Hey, we just got a follow earlier from somebody

02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:17.140
I think that was in your.

02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:19.380
So that was my teammate Binnish.

02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:22.500
Hey, I'm happy, which I want to say Binnish character team.

02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:26.420
OK, Binnish had the highest ranking out of all of all four of us.

02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:29.380
They are a huge fan of MCC.

02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:31.060
They watch it with their dad, which is great.

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:36.180
And they're one of our new members of of our Channel 64 family this season.

02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:40.100
So they they were the ones I mean, honestly owe a lot to them

02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:42.300
because they were the ones that put the video together.

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:44.300
The application video that got in.

02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:46.380
They're the ones that motivated us.

02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:49.100
That was a great that was a great promo, by the way.

02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:50.500
So props to exactly that.

02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:53.580
We got to love those obscure, you know, Atari Jaguar commercials.

02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:57.540
So, yeah, lots of thanks to them, for sure.

02:20:57.860 --> 02:20:59.300
OK, awesome.

02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:02.780
Well, I'm going to keep my final thought tonight very simple.

02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:05.660
I am going to take my cues from the late great Bob Barker and say,

02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:07.940
please don't forget to have your pets spayed or neutered.
