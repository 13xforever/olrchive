0	14640	I love Theorhythm. It's easily among the best spin-offs of a decades-long series that
14640	18280	accentuates one of the consistently best things to come from it. However, I miss Theorhythm
18280	22640	Dragon Quest, predominantly because it only came out in Japan. Reportedly, the final Barline
22640	27000	team wants to branch out beyond Final Fantasy and Square Enix properties. Two sore thumbs
27000	32880	way up. Yes, please. This is the BMS FMS OMG LOL update. Now it's time for your hosts Rob
32880	35600	Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's
35600	38480	gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39960	45680	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
45680	52800	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode
52800	60760	number 949 of our show for tonight, February 19, 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here
60760	65080	with you every week with my pals to talk about the latest and greatest in video gaming and get
65080	69960	your input as we tape live because we want to hear your thoughts too. But in the meantime, you
69960	75400	get my thoughts and you get the thoughts of DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers. Hello. Hello. How
75400	76000	are you doing?
77080	78720	I feel better than I sound.
78920	82440	I was gonna I was gonna kind of get a check in because I know you know you were out two weeks
82480	88320	ago that you're like still recovering last week. So mostly on the mend at this point you feel
88320	89120	better than you sound.
90600	97760	Yeah, I mean, my throat's still pretty bad. I honestly think that my bout with COVID kind of
98200	107160	undid some of the the good that had gone from my my week saw from work. So I emailed my doctor
107160	109280	because I'm pretty sure I have a sinus infection now.
109320	110200	Oh, gosh.
110800	116120	Well, you know, I get them like at the drop of a hat. So it's not like it's just the cough
116120	124320	afterward I've already taken. I always forget like their their brand name, like Tesla line pearls or
124320	129640	something. It sounds like something from a sci fi show. I know it has been donated. It's really
129680	136000	good cough suppressant. I mean, well, I have to get a prescription and then there's this crap.
136280	138120	Well, for gosh sakes be healed.
138720	140080	Lido cane.
140280	143440	Yeah, it's Dennis numbing solution there.
144000	150720	It's not delicious. It's but it feels really good when you've like gotten past the initial
150720	157360	nastiness, especially if you drink something cold with it. It's like extra numb.
158440	163000	All right, well, I mean, hopefully the upside to being sick is that you've had a lot of time to
163000	167880	play games, but we'll check in in just a little bit. In the meantime, let's say hello as well to
167880	169240	Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.
169960	170640	Hey, how's it going?
170720	173480	I am doing good. How's your week been?
174160	177640	It's been all right. Yeah. Busy, busy. Yeah.
178320	184880	So we do tape live of course, at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice of geeks network every
184880	189880	Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And
189880	194640	if you care to join us live, you can see our lovely faces as we're chatting doing this show and
194640	199800	sometimes there's visual flair going on. For example, Loki likes to have, you know, different
199800	204760	video games that are playing behind him while he's chatting and tonight I it looks like some
204760	210200	version of theme park or is that is that the new the newer one rollercoaster? Planet Coaster? Yeah,
210200	215560	okay. Yeah, it's that one. I'm sorry, but every time I see one of those theme park games, I always
215560	221160	think of that video I saw somewhere of rollercoaster tycoon or something where like the the
221160	226120	Rihanna song is playing and it's all happy. And then the coaster goes off the rails and everybody
226120	232520	dies and it turns to Adele and I don't know why it's the funniest fucking video, but it is. So
233440	238960	anyway, it's a lot funnier than I just described it. I promise look it up on YouTube. I don't even
238960	245520	know what it's called. But Tiger Claw will still find it I'm sure so. But why Planet Coaster? Is
245520	247920	that a game that you've been into lately? Or you just been thinking about?
248480	253760	No, I just I saw a video earlier this week of one of the streamers I watch, Doug Doug,
253760	263040	and he did a thing where he was trying to survive in Planet Coaster for one hour. But every five
263040	268480	minutes of random like he had this giant wheel they'd spend there'd be a random kind of handicap
268480	274560	in the game. So like whether you had to like spend half your money on benches or like move the
274560	280800	coaster to the farthest end of the park and like ridiculous stuff like that. And so it was it was
280800	284400	just like that video is pretty funny. So it reminded me of that as like, you know, I should
284400	291040	probably play that game since I have it and I not played it but I probably should play it looks fun.
292560	298080	Apparently SSJ 100 Matt won the YouTube fight there because there it is. Apparently that's it.
298080	301760	I can't bring it up because I don't want to get the station DMCA'd with the copyright music,
301760	307920	but I'm just assuming it's right. So good job, Matt. Awesome. All right.
307920	310000	I've seen that video without the music before.
310880	317040	The music makes it that much better. It really does. All right. Sorry to the podcast listeners.
318000	323760	Ask on Discord. We'll post the link at our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord,
323760	328800	where you can join and chat with us throughout the week or throughout the next two weeks. I know I've
328800	333200	been saying this, you know, broken record the last month. But for those that, you know, maybe don't
333200	337920	check in every week and what have you, I will not be here next week. Alan and I are going on a
337920	344160	well-deserved vacation. I'm just gonna say it. We earned it and we're going on vacation. And we did
344160	351200	this in 2020 right in the before times we went on the Star Trek cruise. So we are going again this
351200	357200	year. We skipped, they actually did a cruise last year. But between the home buying and we still
357200	362880	weren't quite comfortable with where COVID was at in the world at that point. So we didn't go
362880	368720	last year. But this year, it's kind of one of those. Well, that thing can get me anywhere. So
368720	373440	I'm just saying screw it and going on the cruise and I think we'll have a good time. So excited
373440	379520	about that. So but I won't be here. So I'm not here to push buttons. So are you streaming next
379520	384000	week Dark Soccer? Are you gonna like just take a week off yourself? Yeah. Awesome. So then check
384000	392400	out Dark Soccer. No, I have a week to make up for. So come hell or high water, you know, I'll
392400	397280	hire a voiceover artist if I have to have someone speak for me, but I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna
397280	405840	start at our time too. You know, with the modern, you know, technology that is AI generated voices,
405840	411360	you could actually just copy your voice with about a minute worth of clips. I've played with that,
411360	418080	and it's fun. You could do it. It sounds weird to myself, but like it's, I'd say it's like 80%
418080	423760	convincing. Link me the thing because I actually what I want to do is use that for Midna in my
423760	430240	videos. Yeah, that could be fun. Get that individual with their absolute chaotic energy
430240	434240	that plays Dead by Daylight Swift with you on stream and get them to just narrate your stream.
434240	441280	Yeah. Shayla would totally do it. Just have Shayla narrate your stream. But honestly,
441280	445440	when Shayla's in there, I don't really have to talk because all of them through the background
445440	454320	you hear, I love you. I love you. Yay, babe onomori. Yay, RPG. I love Shayla. I'm gonna go
454320	458560	boop the killer. I'm gonna go boop the killer. Love me. Love me. Love me. It's really funny.
459280	463920	Did I tell you about the trickster that we totally confused the other last week?
463920	467360	Here we go. I've derailed with Dead by Daylight talk. All right. Make it quick.
467360	471280	We've got news to get into. Okay. It's by daylight derailed by daylight.
472320	476960	But like, I was, I was just gonna play straight. We were in the airy and I was working on where
476960	484320	the no, no, no. Never play straight. Always play gay. Rob. All right. I was going to play
484320	492480	standard. I was going to play a normal game. Got her. And next thing I know, here comes Shayla
492480	498960	being chased by the trickster and then like doing the little, you know, bop thing in, in front of
498960	503760	him and then pointing. And I was like, Oh hell. So I just came over and did the same thing too.
503760	508160	And he just like followed us around for half the match before he decided to start playing seriously.
508720	515040	And then afterwards he comes in my chat and it's like, I'm so confused.
516000	520720	So we, we explained that, that Shayla is the killer whisperer.
522960	527520	And, and I, I said, yeah, we killer mains know our own. I'm a dirty pig main.
528160	531760	All right. All right. So it was pretty funny though.
531760	535360	Derailed by Daylight. Just another segment here on Orange Launch Radio. I love that name.
537360	541760	That's right. Yep. We need to, can somebody arrange that on the Wiki? A Derailed by Daylight
541760	545280	page. All right. And when it was Mass Effect, was it Mass Derailment?
546320	549360	Something like that. I think it was Mass Effect at some point.
551120	555760	All right. Moving on. Let's talk about other video games that are in the news this week.
555760	562160	And Metroid Prime, the remaster is in the news. But this particular reason, maybe not a great
562160	567840	one, but let's talk about maybe the standard this game is calling attention to. I don't think this
567840	570880	is the first game where this has happened, but let's talk about it. Loki, you want to get into
570880	577520	this for us? It's not the first game that's happened. I'm not sure why we can't just include,
577520	586320	you know, credits for the people that make games, but apparently Metroid Prime remastered does not
586320	592240	include the full original game credits. So that everybody that worked on the original game
593200	597680	is not credited in it. All you get instead is a single card that says based on the work of
597680	603760	Metroid Prime, original Nintendo GameCube and Wii version development staff. Like,
605200	609680	it doesn't cost anything to put credits in the game unless they have like some sort of contract
609680	613920	with your name appears in this, then you get money somehow or something like that, which
613920	619200	I mean, they probably should be owed some money at the very least. But I don't understand why
619200	623840	it would be so hard to put current credits for somebody that worked on the game originally. Like
623840	629920	that's what they do when they adapt things and stuff like that. I've seen other remasters that
629920	633040	they put the credits in there. But this isn't like the first time that they've done this.
634320	639600	I remember, I'm trying to remember which game it was now. But I know we had something like that
639600	646000	where it was, you know, the original creator of it wasn't credited before. It wasn't that long
646000	653600	ago either. But I don't know, it is kind of annoying. Let me ask a difficult question, though.
653600	658640	If this individual who tweeted about it, who I'm assuming was one of the individuals who worked on
658640	665040	the original game, if this person hadn't called it out, would anyone have noticed?
665040	670320	Like, how many people are actually watching video game credits? And please don't say yes,
670320	675040	just because you want to be different out there. Like, I just think there's a lot of people,
675680	681840	and I'm not, you know, please don't misunderstand me. I do think, you know, the people that did work
681840	686640	on the game deserve to be acknowledged and so forth. I'm just kind of curious if anyone would
686640	690240	have really noticed if it hadn't been pointed out on social media, because I don't think a lot of
690240	694080	people watch video game credits, or they might play a mini game during the credits or something
694080	700240	like that. And I understand like the, I understand the point, like, if this is a game that's
700240	705680	completely rebuilt from the ground up, and using some of the assets, and even kind of rebuilt the
705680	713200	assets too. So like, I get it, like, it's weird, you know, crediting the original team when you've
713200	717600	basically taken none of their work and just redid it. But I mean, there's still story and other
717600	721440	elements and stuff like that. I still think that they should be credited, like at the very least,
721440	728160	you know, original game, you know, something brief, like, you know, just listening to team
728160	731440	members or something like that, you don't have to go into detail, like this person did, like,
731440	736000	you know, artwork in the original games, like when that's not necessarily represented in the
736000	744560	full game. I still think it is kind of a little bit of like, kind of a, I don't know, but it's
744560	750480	not nice. It's not nice. But to that, like, I don't think it's necessarily the team that did
750480	757600	the remasters job to put that information in there. Also, they may have not had that information
757600	761200	to begin with, like, they may not know who worked on the original game.
765040	768320	Well, right. But like, are you going to watch everything and, you know,
768320	773200	transcribe everything like that's not something. Yeah, you could, but that should be provided by
773200	778560	Nintendo, Nintendo should say, Hey, you know, we want to make sure or they could have reached out
778560	783280	and said, Hey, we want to put the, you know, we want to credit the people that originally worked
783280	789120	on this game. Can we get a list of the credits from the previous game? I don't know. I don't
789120	793680	know what goes on behind the scenes. But yeah, I think it is kind of get their name in there,
793680	798960	even if they lower the font size or do it like what I mean. But this is what credits turn into
798960	804880	sometimes is I think about when they show a movie on TV. And then like, instead of letting the
804880	809680	credits roll, they reduce the credits to like a quarter of the size of the screen while they're
809680	813200	showing the preview for the next movie. And then this credits are just flying by like they turn up
813200	818720	the credits like 10 speed, which is or they flash along the bottom like there's different ways that
818720	823600	they do it. And I think that's I think that's for union related reasons and kind of the point I
823600	828800	wanted to get to. I think those credits have to be shown for like union related reasons. The TV
828800	835120	station just can't cut them out as part of the rights for airing the movie. I wonder if video
835200	840720	game industry is headed for unionization as we've talked about many, you know, past months on this
840720	846080	show. I wonder if we shouldn't see something in there about video game credits in these types of
846080	851040	cases and when they should be kept in the game. I think it would be interesting to see what comes
851040	857520	to that. Whether it ends up being credits on fast forward or what? I mean, this has always been an
857520	863760	issue in the industry. I mean, do we do we not remember adventure or was it adventure? Yeah.
864560	870400	Or the Atari of that era was infamous for not crediting their designers, which is why a lot of
870400	875520	the talented folks went over to Activision, where you could play David Crane's Pitfall,
875520	880240	like his name was right there in the, you know, title of the game. Yeah, that was, you know,
880960	885200	it's interesting to think about Activision today and all of their problems. But actually, in the
885200	890240	80s, Activision was kind of seen as the one that was more progressive when it came to the rights
890240	895760	of the game makers by crediting them in the games and they lured talent that way was huge deal. And
895760	900720	then yes, one of the earliest Easter eggs and adventure like you brought up the initials of the
900720	906800	game's creators. That was that was put in there as kind of an F you to the whole lack of credits
906800	912720	thing. So we can't do that because they would be they caught wind of anything like that. Okay,
912800	920160	we're gonna patch that out, you know? Yeah. So, yeah, we can do and but also remember back in
920160	928480	those days, one person often made those entire games, you know, et yards revenge were both made
928480	933680	by one person is actually the same person infamously the best and the worst 2600 game,
933680	938080	although I actually don't think et is the worst 2600 game, because there's a good game in there
938080	942000	somewhere. Whereas there's other games on the Atari 2600. But there is no good game in there
942000	950000	whatsoever. But I digress. I'm going in the chat over twitch.tv slash vog network some folks
950000	955040	answering the question about do you actually look at the chat. Fifth dream in chat says I know
955040	960480	people who named Pokemon who haven't been in the credits since then. Dr. Tia says I heard this was
960480	966240	also an issue with the Pac Man World remaster. Fifth dream says I let them roll. I don't read
966240	971120	every credit. Bobby Black Wolf says depends on how good the music is that's playing behind the
971120	975840	credits. Or if my name is in the credits as a backer. I think we all enjoy a good little
975840	980960	mini game in the credits like Smash Brothers comes to mind. I think there's quite a few shooter games
980960	984560	out there too that have like shooting mini games in the credits and things that didn't katamari
984560	988960	damasi have like a roll up the credits thing or am I making that out? Okay. Oh, no, it did. Yeah.
988960	995520	So there's that. Bobby Black Wolf says if you worked on the game three years ago and left the
995520	999760	company, they don't put your name in the credit. To be fair, some modern games only credit the
999760	1004720	people who are with the company when the game is released. Interesting perspective. And then some
1004720	1009040	other folks bringing up other games that have like credit mini games that help you to get paid
1009040	1013840	attention. As Joe and Hunter Matt says credits are a voluntary experience for the most part in
1013840	1019040	gaming. I kind of feel why not just include them if the credits are too long folks can skip them
1019040	1025200	or not just watch them just seems odd. Well, I always I mean, maybe I'm wrong. But I you know,
1025200	1030960	Marvel movies are infamous for their post credit scenes and their mid credit scenes and all of
1030960	1036080	this. And why do they do that? I think in part it's to get people to stay through the credits.
1036080	1039920	Because pretty much any time you go to see a movie, people get up and leave during the
1039920	1044720	credits. Although now Marvel has conditioned us all to be afraid to do that. I remember
1044720	1048960	literally sitting there during Megan and I was like, do we do we need to sit here in case there's
1048960	1053920	something after the credits. And we quickly googled Megan after credits. And we saw Okay,
1053920	1058720	no, there's no after credit scene we can go. But it's just it's interesting how that but then you
1058720	1065680	think think back to the early movies, the early days of movies. credits used to be in the beginning
1066480	1071760	of the movie. Most relevant example I can think of would be like Rocky Horror Picture Show,
1071760	1077040	you know, I've seen that movie a lot. And think about that whole opening song with the lips. It's
1077040	1082800	the opening credits. Now it's not an exhaustive list of credits as they often weren't in that day,
1082800	1089920	but you get a lot of big credits at the top. This is kind of interesting. So Bobby Lockwolf says
1089920	1094080	most of the people in the Ant Man screening I was at last night left after the midpoint. Well,
1094080	1100400	that's on them. I tell you, that's fine. You really only miss a preview of Loki season two
1100400	1104720	anyway. So it's no big deal. Let's see Fit Dream says I never left because I remember some end
1104720	1110720	credit scenes as early as the 80s. Dark to see says good. We didn't miss anything. That must be
1110720	1117280	a reference to Megan. That's really funny. So um, so yeah, I don't know that the credit issue is
1117280	1123040	interesting. But I think, oh, yeah, Bobby Black will bring it up an 80s movie that had that
1123040	1129760	Ferris Bueller asking Why are you still here? Remember that after the credits? Go home. Yeah,
1129760	1134560	it's good, good stuff. But it I think this is gonna be a very interesting issue, especially as
1134560	1139040	we start looking at like the furthering of unions and games like how this credit issue and even to
1139040	1142640	Bobby's point, what happens to those folks that they worked on the game, but they left the
1142640	1146880	company? How do they get credited? I think there's going to be some interesting stuff to come with
1146880	1151840	this. But also what I would say to the developers out there is put mini games in your credits and
1151840	1157040	put post credit scenes in there. So if you if you really want people to watch them, but also
1157040	1166960	some credit scenes are really, really long, like Final Fantasy 14's credits are a lot, especially
1166960	1171600	I would I would actually encourage you not to watch the realm reborn credits because I believe
1171600	1178080	they credited all of the 1.0 players that met certain criteria are like actually in the credits
1178080	1184400	of realm reborn or the early version of it. I think my favorite credits that they've had was
1184400	1190400	the Lego Movie Two. They made a song about the credits that now that's clever. I like that. And
1190400	1196800	that was funny. It was great. I like the little mid credit and post credit sequences. I think
1196800	1202160	that's enough to get people to stick around and like every every RPG at this point has a lot of
1202160	1207760	those. So you know, it's good. Fifth Dream points out the Weird Al movie has a good end credit song.
1207760	1212320	All right. Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of good stuff out there. But as far as this game is
1212320	1218880	concerned, it's it's really a shame what happened to the folks. But also I would kind of ask like
1218880	1224160	how many people are actually watching these credits. I think we need to maybe have an online
1224160	1229520	resource as well. Make sure that these folks are credited on the video game version of the internet
1229520	1232880	movie database and that sort of thing, you know, make sure that they have the credits,
1232880	1236400	so that when people are looking up their names to see what they worked on for industry stuff,
1236400	1241840	you can kind of see like what they what they've done fully, I think is a good thing to have out
1241840	1244960	there too, because that's really what credits are for, right? If your game wins an award,
1244960	1250320	you want to be able to tout that award. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming
1250320	1254720	weeks, whether we rolled credits or not, the types of video games that we have been playing
1254720	1257680	this week. So Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
1259440	1266880	I played Star Ocean last night on my stream. And I had to do a lot of backtracking. But
1267760	1274400	I'm really having a good time with it. The game is absolutely gorgeous. And the sprites are huge.
1274400	1285200	And it's got all the extra audio in it. It's such a good game. And then I was what else I do.
1286400	1293680	I played of course Dead by Daylight, but I only played like one night because it's funny. Okay,
1293680	1300560	so I've been in training at work to get myself back into the general scheme of things. And I
1300560	1308560	had to be up at 5am or 5.30am like that to be at work by seven. And well, the night before that,
1308560	1314800	because you remember I was just getting over COVID. I went to bed that Monday at like 2am,
1314800	1320720	or technically Tuesday morning and woke up at 5pm at the time I normally stream.
1321360	1328080	Needless to say, I didn't play Dead by Daylight that night and I didn't stream. So I'm
1328960	1336880	uh, I am going, I'm also, I did play A Little Among Us. I love that game. It's pretty fun.
1338480	1344160	I'm playing my wordscapes. I'm super addicted. And I've honestly gotten to where I can beat
1344880	1350960	some of the harder levels in like 15 seconds. Because I'm a word nerd.
1351920	1357600	Um, and then we watched a couple of documentaries. One was on the
1357600	1364000	entire history of Samus Aran. And the other one was on the history of the Star Fox series.
1365040	1369600	Which actually makes me really disappointed that Star Fox Zero wasn't a better game.
1370160	1375920	Because it was beautiful. That's it. Oh, one more thing. One more thing.
1376560	1380240	Okay, we have we have the Beatlemania Pinball Table by Stern.
1381040	1383200	Oh, yeah. Didn't you mention last week you traded for it?
1384400	1389040	We did. And I actually finally played it. And it goes sometimes from being a complete
1389680	1392400	proper gentleman to being a right arsehole.
1394400	1399680	Love it. By the way, a fashion comment from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network,
1399680	1403120	Garth the Wolf in chat saying Jamie, I love that your hair matches your glasses.
1403760	1408400	And for the those in the podcast feed they do and the lipstick I think matches to the darker color
1408400	1414160	of the glasses a little bit more purpley. The color is called hold on I have it with me.
1415120	1421360	Orchis by color pop. And for those looking, it is very dark.
1422000	1424000	Bobby wants to know what you traded for Beatlemania.
1424880	1428320	Well, it was a temporary trade. We traded Indianapolis.
1428720	1429220	Hmm.
1430400	1436240	Um, so no, we traded racing for for classic early rock.
1436800	1443120	But I love that table so much those Beatles your local community that like Dan participates in
1443120	1448800	they trade tables for like the sake of just having different stuff in and out of the house.
1448800	1453280	Yeah, let's say Yeah, trading Nintendo cartridges. Exactly. It's not always a value based trade
1453280	1457440	necessarily. Like, you just kind of all know each other and you know, you're all good for it.
1457440	1457940	Basically.
1459120	1465520	Yeah, and I mean, it's, it's not like we haven't done permatrades before for equal value.
1466160	1472080	You know, it's just that, you know, everybody in the community loves their tables and we know
1472080	1477360	everybody else loves their tables. And so like, there's even like trade work that goes on from
1477360	1484880	time to time too. But, but at this point, you know, we, the people that we will trade with
1484880	1491200	know that we will take care of their babies. Yeah. And it's a good way to experience a table
1491200	1497520	you might not have otherwise experienced. Yeah. Good call. All right. I can't wait to get where
1497520	1503280	now. Oh. All right. Well, let's move on and talk to Loki about his gaming week. How was your gaming
1503280	1511840	week? Loki is just Minecraft again. I mean, as as his tradition, I was mostly playing my modded
1512480	1518080	version. So the monsters of mechanics stuff, I'm just trying to set up my next build. So I
1518080	1523680	finished designing it finally this week. And I've been gathering materials and, and figuring out
1523680	1529920	different mod conflicts, because we had a problem with a mod they had added in where now I couldn't
1529920	1537200	claim ladders, for some reason. And it's a really weird mod to cause that problem, but it did. So I
1537200	1544000	figured it out and took it out. But yeah, it's been it's been a lot of fun. I've been having
1544000	1548720	some fun with it. I'm still disappointed that it's taken me so long to get an episode out
1548720	1554560	under that series right now. And then I know going into like, the actual S&P stuff for channel 64.
1555920	1561760	That's gonna take a while to because what I need to design next is a, I think it's I think I'm
1562720	1569680	doing too much is what I think I'm doing. Because I look at like, for example, hermit craft and like
1569680	1576560	mumbo jumbo is the guy that just came back off of like an eight month hiatus. And he like,
1576560	1583680	literally worked on like a teeny, teeny, teeny tiny part of his base. And he didn't even finish
1583680	1589120	it. He like continue working on it from like the previous episode. And like here, I look at the
1589120	1595440	stuff I'm building. It's like, like a whole mega vase size, like build every episode. And I think
1595440	1602320	it's too much. I'm doing too much. So it takes like four times as long, which I don't know if
1602320	1609200	that's good or bad. But like, it's just I want it to be more frequent. But I don't know how to
1609200	1613760	divide it up enough to where I can be able to do that on a regular basis. So that's gonna be
1613760	1618720	something for next season to figure out and stuff. But we got more news today about like,
1618800	1623360	or not this today, but this week about the new Minecraft version. So they added like,
1624720	1629680	cherry blossom forest type thing as like a new biome and stuff. So that's kind of neat.
1631280	1636080	Yeah, but yeah, my mod series liking it. It's been a lot of fun. All right.
1638160	1643200	My gaming week. So early on, it was a lot of the similar stuff I always talk about on the show,
1643200	1647520	like Final Fantasy 14. I've been trying to get the trophies on the PlayStation five version,
1647520	1652720	because 14 on the PlayStation five has separate trophies from the PlayStation four and PlayStation
1652720	1656720	three loads. So that's been kind of fun to go through that. I played a little bit of crash
1656720	1661040	bandicoot the trilogy I played a little bit of the first game because that was one of the games
1661040	1664960	I just loaded onto my PlayStation five because I was like I picked that up and PlayStation Plus
1664960	1670000	at some point just never really played it. So I played a little bit of that. And then dead by
1670000	1675280	daylight just a little bit not a lot saw the latest info about the new killer and you know,
1675920	1680400	I mean, it looks all right. I don't know how well balanced that killer is going to be.
1680400	1683280	The new survivors are more interesting than the new killer, quite frankly.
1683280	1687280	The killer is really cool, but her Mori is crap.
1687280	1693440	The killer is a well designed character. I'm just not sure I'm into them as a killer,
1693440	1697920	but we'll see. I mean, they also tend to change things before the actual release. So we'll see.
1697920	1703600	I think she'll get a more interesting Mori but I really do like the the drone mechanic.
1704320	1707920	Oh, I will say this about that new killer as long as we're going to derail by daylight.
1709680	1714960	A lot of people were compared actually I really whoever said I'm sorry, some streamer said
1714960	1719200	their mechanics really remind them of the predator. And I was like,
1719200	1724000	that's a really interesting call out because predator DLC has been rumored for a long time.
1724720	1730480	Holly Esther did a video on if she was supposed to be predator or not.
1731200	1735440	And then I look at her face. And a lot of people say, oh, she's like Terminator,
1735440	1740560	she's like a T2 robot type of thing. And I could maybe see that type thing too. But you know what
1740560	1749280	she really looks like to me? Fem Kano. She's Fem Kano. She's not Kano, she's Kana. That's Kana.
1750640	1754800	That is that is what she is to me. She's Kano with the lasers and everything. That's her.
1754800	1759920	And that's why her Mori should be a laser burn like Kano's thing or the heart thing or something.
1759920	1763600	She's wearing a mask and it's not built into her. All of her stuff is add on.
1763600	1765680	I know, but it still reminds me of that.
1766400	1772400	But I was in a polyester stream when the PTB went live. You know, just hanging out and chatting and
1772400	1779600	watching the new killer. And there was a person who's like, yeah, she's like, X23,
1779600	1788640	who is now Wolverine for the record, there's two Wolverines, meets something else, you know.
1789360	1794880	And I was like, I don't know. I mean, they were just saying that she was way too derivative.
1794880	1805920	But I went and I actually ripped the model out of the game files. I actually went and downloaded
1805920	1812880	all of the game models so that I would have this PTBs worth of models. And when I put her together,
1813520	1821520	there's a lot of really good detail on her weapon that makes it look like something that she did
1821520	1825600	build herself. And I think that the best description of her is anti Batman.
1826320	1829520	Yeah, yeah. Oh, she's very anti Batman. But anyway,
1829520	1831840	She's like Batman, but a serial killer.
1832800	1834320	So anyway, Brazilian.
1835200	1840480	Yeah, yeah, it's all Brazilian pack, basically, because the survivors are a Brazilian brother
1841120	1845440	and sister too. So you know, fun to have different countries represented and all that.
1846640	1851760	So anyway, the bulk of my gaming week is they're easily calling out in the chat right now over
1851760	1856080	twitch.tv slash vog network, I've been playing this shit out of theater them final bar line,
1856080	1861440	because that released the middle of this week for PlayStation four and switch and I did pick
1861440	1866480	it up on PlayStation five backwards compatible PlayStation four, obviously. So I've been playing
1866480	1871520	a bit of that I had a little trouble getting it up and running. Something I found out was that the
1872320	1877920	3.0 dashboard beta for the PlayStation five, which I guess they were giving away codes that
1877920	1882480	you could give to your friends. So you know, Shane hooked me up with a code. And I installed that we
1882480	1888560	actually the beta dashboard is nice, because we were using discord on the PlayStation, as I was
1888560	1893280	getting my trophies unlocked and Final Fantasy 14 and all that. So there are good things about that
1893280	1898960	beta. But the bad thing is, it prevented theater them from unlocking on time. And it took me a
1898960	1902640	little bit to figure that out. And I was doing this all live. And I'd promised Oh, we're gonna
1902640	1907280	go in theater them right as its launches are going to be live. And of course, I get held up for 30
1907280	1912000	minutes trying to diagnose why it's not running. Finally, we figure out it's the beta. So anyway,
1912000	1917760	I hope they fix that for future releases, because that was annoying to say the least. But once I got
1917760	1923440	and that that's not a Square Enix problem. That's a Sony beta problem. And in complete fairness,
1923440	1927520	because somebody actually asked him I chat when that happened, like, Oh, are you gonna, you know,
1927520	1932640	tweet at Sony and you know, complain at him for what's going on. And I'm like, like, honestly,
1933360	1940240	this is why when you sign up for a beta, they warn you many times, the beta may be unstable,
1940240	1945120	you're in a beta for a reason to find problems like what I found the other night. So there's
1945120	1951600	really nobody to complain to. I fucked around and I found out so to speak, except you know,
1951600	1955760	I wasn't doing anything wrong. But that is just there are pitfalls to doing betas. And that is
1955760	1960640	one of them. So there's nobody to complain to. Luckily, it's very easy to revert. So I actually
1960640	1965920	give Sony credit for that it was very easy to revert and be able to get in the game right away
1965920	1971200	for that. So I've been playing the shit out of theater them. Every second of the game I've played
1971200	1975360	I've streamed so I played like three hours on Wednesday night, three hours on Thursday night,
1975360	1979920	four hours last night. I don't usually stream for more than four hours. But last night was
1979920	1986240	an exception. There's a definite lack of Angela Aki. I know you're so pressed about that. But
1986240	1992560	there's there's a lot of strange omissions. Considering that there are over 500 songs when
1992560	1998320	you count all the DLC and stuff. It does make the omissions stand out that much more. But I
1998320	2003280	understand that there are licensing issues and things like that. For you know, for you,
2003280	2007600	you're missing that song. For me, I was disappointed. They don't have any Endwalker
2007600	2012560	stuff from Final Fantasy 14. Because like close in the distance is one of the most amazing songs
2012560	2016400	ever written for a video game. And the fact that that's not in there is tragic. But maybe it'll be
2016400	2025760	DLC later. Who knows? The old da music like the the levels. I my favorite music in 14. I don't
2025760	2031920	know if old old does in there. I'd have to look at the list. So but they have like status. Yeah,
2031920	2035920	that's my favorite music in the entire game so far. There's a there's a lot of songs that are
2035920	2040160	missing. But there are a lot of songs that are in it. And I have to say overall, I don't want to
2040160	2044560	dwell on these missing songs because honestly, the game is incredible. Those those omissions aside,
2044560	2051760	like you know, things that are my jam Final Fantasy games, music games, retro games. This
2051760	2056960	really hits on all those points. And obviously, this is a formula that started 10 years ago,
2056960	2061360	I'm thrilled that I can play it on a non portable console now, being that it's on PlayStation,
2061360	2066480	not that I hate portable gaming, I just tend to play living room style games more often. And so
2066480	2073760	I'm thrilled that that's there. The only thing that gets a little bit wonky versus the DS are
2073760	2078880	the green control paths. They're really simplified since there's no stylus to trace with. It's just
2078880	2083920	kind of up and down. But the arcade version wasn't that much different all things considered.
2083920	2088240	I mean, it did have sensitivity, but you know, it's not too much of a departure from what it
2088240	2091680	was the arcade. And I think that's kind of what they were doing with this is they were really
2091680	2095840	trying to put all the music that they've done over the years, not just for the DS versions,
2095840	2100800	but for the arcade version, because a lot of those 14 songs were in the arcade version.
2100800	2104800	And they've kind of made like a definitive edition of this game because the arcade version
2104800	2109360	no longer has the online access. So this is kind of a way for fans of the arcade version,
2109360	2113680	as well as the DS version to have one last hurrah. They are saying it's the last one.
2114240	2120560	But we'll see. I mean, it seems like, you know, again, it might just be bias of the people around
2120560	2127840	me or the people I follow on social media. I know way more people that spent $100 on the digital
2127840	2134160	deluxe edition for theater them, then actually bought for spoken. And I'm sorry to be shady,
2134160	2138560	because I haven't played at all for spoken. I don't know if it's a good game or a bad game.
2138560	2142640	But I'm just saying for all the marketing and all the push that Square Enix put into that game,
2142640	2148240	I feel like this other little game sitting over here is just selling not just copies,
2148240	2154240	but collector's edition copies, basically, essentially. So, and st 100, Matt and chat says
2154240	2158480	would be cool if they added some Enix deep cuts, like it would be cool to hear some Actraiser in
2158480	2163280	there. Some of the songs they have coming for digital deluxe are great. Chrono Trigger and
2163280	2168800	Chrono Cross will be represented in a pack near automata. That alone, the fact that I'm going to
2168800	2176240	get to play way to the world is amazing. And live live is going to be pretty soon. I think it's the
2176240	2181440	next one coming. The first DLC pack was like two songs from Final Fantasy adventure. And then
2181440	2188240	Romancing Saga had some songs. I know Secret of Mana is on the deck at some point too. But not
2188240	2194480	Secret of Evermore, frown, because you know, some are complicated. It's it's weird, because there
2194480	2200720	are some Final Fantasy games that are represented that you literally can't play anymore. Final
2200720	2206240	Fantasy Mobius, Final Fantasy Record Keeper, those mobile games that are no longer supported. This is
2206240	2211760	pretty much all that exists of them now, which is interesting. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest has eight
2211760	2216480	songs represented, which is great because the soundtrack was the best part of Final Fantasy
2216480	2224080	Mystic Quest, quite honestly. So it's astounding that that's there. That's great. So yeah, it's
2224080	2228720	really fun to play along with the songs. There's a whole little meta game going on. You have
2228720	2233760	characters that you level as you play songs, and then you use those characters to complete quests.
2233760	2237920	You see this whole little background thing going on. And it looks like it's just idle background
2237920	2243920	animation at first until you realize that no, this game is actually going based on the success of
2243920	2248960	your notes and the things that you've equipped to your characters that like, oh, maybe cloud will do
2248960	2254800	a braver attack after you hit 50 critical notes in a row. Like and you have to build this to be able
2254800	2259040	to finish quests in the game. So this, there's definitely it wouldn't be a Final Fantasy game if
2259120	2264400	there wasn't some type of grind to go with it. So they've definitely built that into the game.
2264400	2270240	Apparently, not only can you level the 99, but then you can get stars after level 99. So you
2270240	2278320	literally have tons and tons of stuff to grind in that game. Garth the Wolf, I know you love Near.
2278880	2286160	What is the song with the robots and the boss where it goes, this cannot continue, this cannot
2286160	2290800	continue, and then it starts to get all like dancy as you're fighting the boss. That song
2290800	2297280	fucks. And I hope that is in the theater them near DLC pack because that was probably my favorite
2297280	2302800	song that was in the just just the way it turned the computer. Like as you're playing the game,
2302800	2308480	the way it turned like what was happening into the game into the music was like incredible. So
2308480	2312240	Birth of a Wish. That's right. Because I know I've looked that up on YouTube before. Birth of a Wish.
2312240	2318800	I hope that songs in there. So yeah, it's an alternate there because the Japanese version does
2318800	2323680	the same thing. Although they're saying a phrase in Japanese instead. But it does. It's the same
2324480	2330880	trick. So it's very cool. Anyway. Alright, so I don't I don't know what else to say about
2330880	2335360	theater them. Like if you like music games, if you like Final Fantasy games, you've probably
2335360	2339280	already bought the $100 edition. I you don't need to hear any more from me. But then again, I will
2339520	2346000	say since I've been streaming the game so much. I have actually had two people tell me I bought
2346000	2349840	this game from watching you play the stream. Thanks for showing me what this game is all
2349840	2355920	about to which I say influencer. Where's my code next Times Square? Where's my code?
2358480	2362480	Oh, maybe two and a half SSJ 100 Matt says maybe I'll get this sometime down the road.
2362480	2368320	I will say there is a multiplayer. I only played it a little bit. But it's kind of it's kind of
2368320	2375120	neat. I like that, you know, they put I don't like all the little like, oh, the fat chocobos
2375120	2381200	hide the lane, or extra squares and triangles get in there or you know, I don't like all those silly
2381200	2385680	little moves. But you can actually play multiplayer with those off. So I do like how
2385680	2389600	highly customizable it is. Actually, on the customizable note, I'll let this be my final
2389600	2394240	thought on theater them and then we'll move on. On the customizable note. I do love like there's
2394240	2399360	four levels of difficulty, right? Basic and then expert is actually the medium difficulty ultimate
2399360	2404960	and then like, you're sick. I don't know what the last level is called. But to me, it's you're sick.
2404960	2411200	Those are like the 17 level songs. You can actually play the songs on your sick mode in
2411200	2418320	simple mode. And how does that work? It takes out all of the yellow flicks, because there's parts of
2418320	2422880	the song where you have to flick the little controller in the direction and the whole it
2422880	2428240	takes all of those out. So you're only hitting button presses. So for some people, that might
2428240	2433040	be easier than trying to do. Oh, thank you. Supreme is what it's called. Not the your sick mode.
2433040	2440080	Um, but yeah, that's cool. But the only downside to that whole thing is that it is not cross
2440080	2447120	platform. So the Switch version and the PlayStation version are on islands, you can't
2447120	2453280	even trade cards profile cards with people on the other platform, which is a bummer. But that's my
2453280	2459520	one little. I wish they did this different, but I also kind of get it. Ah, boo. Bobby Black Wolf says
2459520	2466880	birth of a wish is not in the near pack. Damn it. So good. All right. So you know, they're even
2466880	2472080	though they say it's the final one. Look, we keep naming songs where it's like even though 500 songs
2472080	2477680	are represented. I mean, if you if you like battle on the big bridge from Final Fantasy Five, let me
2477680	2483600	tell you, the Gilgamesh song is remixed like six different times in this game, you will not be
2483600	2491440	disappointed by the amount of Greg in this game. But there are still some omissions. So if they
2491440	2496640	ever wanted to do a theater them on core or whatever the fuck they want to call it. There's
2496640	2501040	still some songs they could put in it. And I think the real gag would be put Kingdom Hearts in it
2501040	2506560	because Melody of Memories was not it. Put Kingdom Hearts in theater them you cowards.
2506560	2514080	Or you know what? Give us fucking Dragon Quest. Bring the Dragon Quest game out locally. Look,
2514080	2518480	I know you didn't do it here because you haven't released Dragon Quest 10 here and you want to
2518480	2523040	pretend we don't know that Dragon Quest 10 is a game even though you've literally released 9 and
2523040	2530640	11 like Square. We know. We know. And Square Enix also put out an offline version of Dragon Quest 10
2530640	2536080	in Japan. Why they have not brought that over here still? I don't know. But the Dragon Quest
2536080	2541760	game would be great. And lots of other stuff. Anyway, Garth the Wolf in chat says the nail in
2541760	2546160	the coffin for the Kingdom Hearts rhythm game is no Utada songs were in it. I'm gonna tell you
2546160	2552480	what the nail in that coffin game was was allowing Nomura or whoever's idea it was to say, well, but
2552480	2561040	this is Kingdom Hearts. We need to change the theater them formula. Bad move. Because that game
2561040	2568800	is not it. But if they want to go back and you know what put in the theater them stuff. As Joe
2568800	2576160	and Hunter Matt says, as final as BeatMania the final that theater them 2DX. Make it happen.
2577200	2582160	Well, we have a story later on in the show where maybe we will see theater them in another form.
2582160	2586560	But I will wait until we get that back or until we get to that part of the show. In the meantime,
2586560	2591360	we have some stories to get into. I am gonna let Loki have it with this first story tonight.
2592640	2596400	Yes, let's talk about all the good news with Activision Blizzard. Just kidding. There's
2596400	2601920	no good news. It's never good news. It's Activision Blizzard. So we have statements
2601920	2610480	being made by Mike Ybarra of Blizzard as part of a company wide QA. Some of the things that he did
2610480	2617520	was downplay the stack ranking that was something that was brought up by one developers that was
2617520	2623440	leaving the company. Basically saying, you know, we don't stack rank employees one through exit
2623440	2627280	Blizzard, we have a high expectations over teams manager set goals, blah, blah, blah.
2628880	2635520	That doesn't seem to necessarily reflect the the opinions of folks that are leaving the company
2635520	2642480	because of that reason. But you know, along with that, you know, he also said something
2642480	2646480	to the effect that if you think that executives are making a lot of money and you aren't,
2646480	2652560	you're living in a myth. Like, like executives at Activision Blizzard aren't making a lot of money.
2652560	2657920	I don't believe that. At the end of the day, we want people to be happy and decisions about
2657920	2664240	being happy don't align with with where we're going. And you won't be happy, then you you'll
2664240	2669200	have to do will make you happy. In other words, we're going to do what we want. And you got to
2669200	2678240	get out of here. Other fun stuff that they've been talking about as well. They're making their
2678240	2685200	employees go back to the office, because everybody loves that. Hey, you like remote work, go back to
2685200	2690640	the office. Because in my opinion, they just probably can't sexually harass the people
2690640	2693920	remotely. So they got to bring people in the office so they can continue with their bad
2693920	2701360	behavior to begin with. That's a little much. I have a comment about that I had been off for
2701360	2708240	however many about six months I'd gone shopping. I've been wearing my mask. I didn't go out for a
2708240	2716080	week. I went back in the office for two days and got COVID. Yeah, I don't know why anyone would
2716080	2723040	want to go back. We had a I know, like the company I work at, we're allegedly permanently remote,
2723040	2728160	because they don't have the office space anymore. They leased it out or sold it or whatever,
2729120	2734320	which is good. But there's like a like, a handful of people, actually, I should say like,
2734320	2738800	two that wanted to work in the office. And so now because of that, they're doing this thing,
2738800	2742960	like once a month where they, they go back in the office, and it's not even like a team building
2742960	2746560	thing. It's just we're just going to work in the office one day. And it's such a hassle because
2746560	2751120	you got to like lug all of your equipment over there. You have to reserve a spot because they
2751120	2756640	don't have a scientific anymore. And you have to expose yourself to all these people that are just
2756640	2761360	terrible. I kind of want to do that. You know, it's interesting. Alan and I work at the same
2761360	2765360	place. I'm not going to say much more than that on air. We do very different jobs. Alan actually
2765360	2770880	goes into the office by choice. Our company is also remote like that. But two things that are
2770880	2775520	important in context. Number one, we live less than a mile from the home office. So commuting
2775520	2780240	really isn't a problem. And number two, Alan is very much like, when I'm done with work,
2780240	2784160	I want to get up and walk away and physically leave my work. And I'm kind of like, I respect
2784160	2789600	that. Like, yeah, I get that. So you know, when it's convenient for him to do, I get that. But
2790240	2795040	I feel like it's like maybe him and one other person in that very large area that
2796000	2802960	that the work is our work is starting to get rid of spaces to and leasing or whatever. So
2803680	2809280	very, very interesting. Now for the company that I work at, because our culture is very different
2809280	2814240	from a lot of corporate cultures. And people who know me know where I work, but I'm not saying it
2814240	2821920	on the air again. Um, the culture of my work is built around discussion and debate, and an
2821920	2832480	exchange of ideas and having individual expertise. So I understand why our culture dictates having
2832480	2841120	people together. At the same time, for those of us who have been doing other services within
2841120	2847680	the company who aren't in the management realm or the decision making realm, or the production
2847680	2854880	realm, I, I don't see a need for it. You know, we we have a slack channel, I interact with my
2854880	2860640	co workers that way, I reach out to managers and departments that I want to eventually join and
2860640	2866960	make friends with them. You know, I learned about everything, we can still reach out and have that
2866960	2876560	spirit of communication without actually sharing the same space. And we're back on a on a hybrid.
2877360	2885600	So we go in, no matter what your schedule are, everybody, if they are working a Tuesday,
2885600	2891120	Wednesday or Thursday, they go into the office. So for me, that means that like on my schedule now,
2891120	2894800	my Wednesdays and Thursdays are spent in office and my Friday and Saturday is worked at home.
2895680	2907440	Um, it's, I'm fine with a hybrid schedule, but I still think that there's the sense of denial
2907440	2915520	about the overall necessity and safety and going back into the office. And I think especially
2915520	2922720	because the pandemic is not over. I will repeat that the pandemic is not over.
2923600	2930560	And that is still not the time to be forcing people to go into these environments, harassment,
2930560	2937360	you know, apart from from that, which by the way, at my work, our, our corporate training
2937360	2947600	on harassment has really stepped up its game since this whole thing has gone on. But I think
2947680	2955200	I think that given that baseline that every company is having to deal with,
2955760	2961360	and then given the environment of this particular volatile company,
2963200	2968480	they're making a really bad call. And not just that, but like their performance
2970080	2976400	reviews, the the questionnaire they sent out to their employees. I've talked to a few people
2977360	2985040	this bullshit. Yeah, I mean, we have we have a ranking for like choosing our schedules
2985040	2992080	based on performance. But I think that this company is also still being resistant about
2992080	2998400	people discussing their pay, which by the way, no matter what employer tells you not to discuss
2998400	3004400	your pay, you have a legal right to and everyone should be transparent about what they make and
3004480	3010560	discuss it with others. You need to be paid what you're fucking worth. But going back,
3010560	3023760	but going back to to that, you know, it's it's really this the state of corporate control,
3023760	3031040	I think is what it goes over. They want to have more control over what their employees are doing,
3031040	3036320	be able to observe them, especially given the resistance of Activision Blizzard to
3038480	3045680	recent unionization attempts. I think what they're doing really wrong here is that and this is for
3045680	3049920	any company, really not just Activision Blizzard. But if you want to pull people back into the
3049920	3055840	office, you really have to explain the why the what's in it for them. Why is the company doing
3055840	3062720	this? What is the reason besides, and just people work better in person is not an acceptable reason,
3062720	3067440	because these companies did not go bankrupt in the last three years, they've weathered the pandemic.
3067440	3073120	So you have to be able to explain the why. And until you can do that, to an audience,
3073120	3076720	it's already a little bit unhappy with a lot of your business practices,
3076720	3079920	you're not going to win your employees over. And it's as simple as that.
3079920	3086640	Yeah, and I like it at my job, because they have a legitimate reason as to why.
3087920	3090960	Just, you know, because is not a reason, right?
3092400	3097040	Loki, yeah. And to and to that point, you know, the majority of them don't want to go back to
3097040	3102880	the office full time or part time, they still feel that the risks don't outweigh the benefits.
3102880	3108000	On top of that, you know, further work from home arrangements, they said have resulted employees
3108000	3114720	having more time since they aren't losing and commute, lower gas insurance costs. And, you know,
3114720	3122160	as well as the ability to live further away from the office. Also, you know, there's childcare,
3122160	3127280	schooling, all that stuff, like, I completely understand that. And I know, like, some of,
3127280	3130800	like, especially the company I work for leadership has tried to make the argument like,
3130800	3136560	well, in person, you know, it like, it's, it'll help out with like, some of the issues that are
3136560	3140400	going on with like, poor training and stuff. And I have to remind them like, yeah, but this has
3140400	3146160	been going on, like, well, before we went out on the pandemic, like, this is not going to change
3146160	3149680	if we're in the office, and they will know what we do anyways, even if we were in office. So
3150320	3156640	it's, yeah, it's, it's unfortunate. I know a lot of companies are kind of like, trying to
3157280	3160800	force this a little bit. I don't think it's a good idea.
3161440	3161940	Hmm.
3163280	3168560	Well, we'll see. I mean, this doesn't really change until these employees start leaving,
3169120	3175920	unionize, let their voices, you know, be let some actions speak behind those voices. I'm not saying,
3175920	3180720	and I'm not saying they need to or they have to or whatever. I'm just saying, like, unfortunately,
3181520	3185840	management is very clearly not hearing them. And it's not until these sorts of and this could be
3185840	3189440	any company like today, it's about Activision Blizzard tomorrow, it'll be about somebody else
3189440	3197520	in the industry, this insert company here. If they don't, you know, start making these changes,
3198080	3202560	then some other company that does these types of things is going to snatch them up.
3203680	3207280	Phil and I in in chat says, Oh, I heard from a bliss friend, they were not happy with the
3207280	3213600	decision. And that's when you start, what do they call that rage applying? When you just I'm just
3213600	3218800	going to start applying to other jobs and see what happens. That's when that I mean, heck,
3218800	3223360	I left a company I was with for 14 years because I was under the belief my job was going to be
3223360	3231040	outsourced. It actually never was outsourced. But I because of some actions and things I was
3231040	3234880	convinced and other people had been outsourced. I was convinced it was going to be so I started
3234880	3238560	rage applying and guess what I got a job where I made more money. So I left.
3239280	3243680	Yeah, like if I can complain for a few seconds, I could actually complain for a lot longer than
3243680	3251440	that. But like, I will keep it short. For example, I've I've been complaining that like,
3251440	3256320	obviously, you feel very overworked. I'm doing a lot more work that feels like outside of my
3256320	3261760	job description. And I've been at the company for at least in this position for like over seven
3261760	3269200	years. And I am literally making the state mandated minimum wage for an exempt employee,
3269200	3273920	seven years of experience in this department, integral to the running of this department,
3274560	3283280	two of my employees, same, same everything. They left to go to another department, they're hiring
3283280	3287680	two new employees in those people with zero experience in this position will be making
3287680	3291680	the same amount of money as I am. There is nothing that they're going to do for me.
3292720	3296480	They basically said, Well, if you want more money, you're probably going to,
3296880	3300640	you're being compensated fairly. And if you want more money, you probably have to get look outside
3300640	3309680	of the department. So like, it's just, they've been, they've been walking on eggshells around
3309680	3314720	me because I've just I've lost all patience for everything with them. Like a night.
3315680	3322880	As the last promotion I got at that job that I was at for 14 years, I got that promotion because
3322880	3328640	I bid for a different department and I got offered the job and I said, I'm leaving because
3329440	3334480	I'm not getting promoted here. There's no movement in this department. I am for as much of these
3334480	3338720	accolades that I get for what I do. And I have the facts back it up. I'm never getting promoted.
3338720	3343440	I get a call back the next day. That's basically like, if you try, if you will pull your name from
3343440	3348880	consideration for that, you can choose if you want to go this path or this path. It was wild.
3348880	3352080	I couldn't, I couldn't believe that it happened that way. But it did.
3352080	3356720	Yeah. And, and considering that these two, there's three people that were doing that role in that
3356720	3361840	department. Now there's one, I am the one that knows all of the information. Not a good time
3361840	3367840	to piss me off. Because if I leave your department screwed, it's gone. Because you have literally
3367840	3372320	high level explanations of how to do things. I think you're gonna have to always apply and get
3372320	3377440	the get the offer. And then they'll listen. If it's not too late. And it's right right into what
3377440	3381920	as Joe and Matt says here in chat, we have a mental health crisis worldwide. I think folks
3381920	3385680	have really found the comfort of being able to work from home. Because you have that flexibility
3385680	3390720	to step away from your job in your own space, pet your cat, dog, etc. Take care of your kids. I
3390720	3395680	don't know the best answer to fix or create a work balance. But I think rushing people back in and
3395680	3400720	saying, well, if you don't like it, leave is a toxic strategy. Because guess and I'm adding to
3400720	3406960	that comment saying because guess what they're getting ready to leave. Yeah, I actually like
3407040	3413520	I'd only been back to work for like, maybe four days. It was my last day of training. And I was
3413520	3419200	looking at the job site, there was a position that was there. That was totally up my alley.
3419840	3426080	And it even said in the job description, you just have to meet some of these requirements. We want
3426080	3432080	people who are completely different. It's like for a design prototyping group. And you better believe
3432080	3440080	I touched up my resume, completely the style they want at work. And I had my app in, you know,
3440080	3446000	and I'm gonna keep doing that. And I've even started looking at like industry jobs, like the
3446000	3452720	one for the Pokemon company that I told you about the other day. And if I have to move, I will move
3452720	3458800	because I'll be making the money. You know, they start off at like, for this one job, that's like
3458800	3465360	stuff I do anyway, at like double my salary, just under double my salary. And I would move
3465360	3470400	to Washington for that. We can still do all our we've been doing it virtually for how long?
3471120	3476640	Since 2020. Really? So yeah, and, and it's not like, you know, I don't see you guys from time
3476640	3486400	to time. But, but you know, I would, sometimes you just have to be done. Does that make sense?
3486480	3493920	No, I get it. Yeah, you have to be willing to be done. And take, take that risk. And if you
3494720	3501440	like the company that you work at and believe in the company, then you need to be also be
3501440	3508160	willing to take brave steps to improve what you love. I have to always be critical of what you
3508160	3515680	love. I have to say like, I, where I'm at now, I'm completely happy. I think that companies invested
3515680	3521920	in me in a way that no other company I've worked at has before. I have met some of my career goals
3521920	3527680	at this company. I'm being paid what I should be paid and, you know, have some good benefits to go
3527680	3532240	with that. I have, I work with amazing people. Like I really can't complain. Like my day job
3532240	3538000	is great. It's one thing you're not going to hear me complain about. So, will that still be the case
3538000	3545440	in five, 10 years? That probably depends on if the CEO has changed and what type of work culture the
3545440	3550560	new CEO would bring with them if they keep up the ideals of the current person. Because again,
3550560	3554560	and we've said this since the very beginning of these Activision Blizzard stories, the culture
3554560	3560560	comes from the top down. And that's why Bobby Kotick is unqualified to work in this industry.
3560560	3566320	He is not qualified to be the CEO of a major company the way he is. But because of systems
3566320	3572720	being set up the way they are, he's there. And that is what it is. But the culture really is
3572720	3578560	set from the top down. And at least where I'm at now, I have the good fortune that we got a
3578560	3583840	good guy at the helm that sets a good culture from the top down. And that is exactly why I like where
3583840	3592080	I work. So. I like that about my job too. Yeah. All right, let's move on. And let's talk about
3592080	3596880	other things going on in gaming. Let's talk about something that I'm not sure a lot of companies are
3596880	3601440	on board for because we were talking about that a couple weeks ago on the show. But it sounds like
3601440	3608720	Ubisoft may be in to attend E3 2023. There was a report, of course, that came out a couple weeks
3608720	3614400	ago that said Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo won't be going to E3 in June. But one company that does
3614400	3621520	want to be there is Ubisoft. Speaking to investors, Yves Guillemonde, who also is not qualified to be
3621520	3628240	doing what he is doing, but here we are, said, if E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a
3628240	3633040	lot of things to show. It was a very simple comment, but it obviously has turned a lot of
3633040	3638160	heads because that's one of the major publishers that is committing to E3. But what's interesting
3638160	3647520	about that, if E3 happens, you know, this is a good point to bring up. By the time our show comes
3647520	3655840	back in two weeks, it will be March 6th. That means there will be three months until June,
3656720	3665600	middle of June. 90 days is that sweet spot to book travel. If E3 is, so I'm going to assume
3666400	3670400	one of the storylines we're going to miss next week, or maybe we'll be able to touch it on the
3670400	3676800	March 6th show, but I'm almost certain in the next two weeks, we're going to have a go or a no go on
3676800	3681360	E3. They're either going to say it's happening, here it is, here's the time, and here's all the
3681360	3684960	people that are coming, Ubisoft, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Or we're going to get their
3684960	3690560	release. Ubisoft 3. It's E3. Three companies are coming.
3690560	3695280	E3. Or they're going to put out the press release that says,
3696480	3700880	unfortunately, due to continued COVID concerns, we're canceling the show.
3701840	3704400	Yeah. They'll blame COVID for sure.
3705040	3707120	Because 100% they're not going to blame themselves.
3707920	3708160	No.
3708160	3708800	Who does that?
3708800	3709920	No. No.
3710880	3714960	So, I think that's going to be an interesting thing to tell in the next couple of weeks.
3714960	3721200	Because again, you can't expect, especially international coming from Japan, you cannot
3721200	3728000	expect those folks to make those types of travel plans less than three months in advance. This
3728000	3736000	thing, and if we come back in two weeks and E3 isn't confirmed or canceled, I'm in a different
3736000	3739920	state of what the fuck. Because I'm like, they're really going to try to pull off a
3739920	3746480	show with 60 days notice or something. That is ludicrous. But also another example of
3746480	3752720	how the ESA needs to get their shit together. And has been needed to get their shit together.
3755440	3758960	Dr. C in chat says, I have to wonder what they'd even show.
3758960	3763600	Rayman's main series been dead for a while. Don't hold out much hope for Assassin's Creed,
3763600	3765520	Splitter Cell, maybe Prince of Persia.
3766080	3767120	Well, there's
3767120	3768800	Beyond Good and Evil. I'm just kidding.
3768800	3777600	I was gonna say the there's a rumors of speculation, I guess. From insider gaming that
3777600	3783840	says basically Just Dance 2024, Assassin's Creed, Mirage of Nexus, The Division Heartland,
3783840	3789360	X Defiant, Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones. Again, the continuing saga.
3789360	3792960	There's enough crap. That's what is there's enough crap.
3795280	3801280	All right. But we'll see. We'll see. So I again, in two weeks, I expect we know what the summer
3801280	3806640	looks like. Because we don't know what the summer looks like 90 days out. I don't know what the fuck
3806640	3812000	this industry is doing right now. We'll see. All right, moving on Dark Sakura.
3812000	3818640	Okay, so I'm going into a little bit more of a legal side of things.
3821360	3825440	And this actually isn't like necessarily legal, but I have a feeling it could go that way.
3828560	3837200	There is basically a limit that the UK is asking these companies to put on the data that they
3837200	3845920	gather from people who play different games. There is a report by the information commissioners
3845920	3853440	office that they want video games to to bolster and enforce age restriction. They stated that
3853440	3858320	video games should include a stronger age assurance features for those who are below 18.
3859360	3863600	They've published a list of tips and recommendations on how developers
3863600	3871520	can go about this. Of course, it goes both ways. They say that the personal data of children should
3871520	3876560	only be collected and processed if it is not detrimental to their health or well-being.
3879280	3885760	Going a little bit further into that, the ICO is recommending that any optional use of personal
3885760	3894160	data is set to off by default with consent being given by a parent or guardian. Product placement,
3894160	3900000	paid promotions, and collaborations should be monitored, especially in community servers.
3900560	3908240	They want to put checkpoints like periodic saving of progress and natural breaks in play between
3908240	3914000	game matches into the game design. So that basically, you know, it was sort of like what
3914080	3918640	they were kind of trying to do with WoW. They're saying, you've been playing for a while. Do you
3918640	3928000	want a break? You know, so they want to put up explanations and prompts of steps if, especially
3928000	3932640	if like a child is trying to change the settings or maybe have something that goes back to the
3932640	3940800	adults, like also things like disabling voice chat. I mean, and I think that's reasonable,
3940800	3948320	you know, for younger kids. Yeah, I think it's not obscene what they're asking here.
3949360	3954000	Yeah. And one of the things they even say, I'm looking at the guidelines, I'll just read this
3954000	3959680	verbatim. It's called buff your age assurance, know your players' ages. It says that the age
3959680	3964320	range of your players and the different needs of children at different ages and stages of
3964320	3968720	development should be at the heart of how you design your games and apply the code.
3969680	3979600	So I think that having sort of a floating age level, you know, might be pretty good.
3980240	3986640	There's another one on here about open world gameplay. So they're saying on here,
3987200	3993440	bad privacy information design obscures risks, unravels good player experiences,
3993440	3999840	and sows mistrust between children, parents, and game providers. You could run user research to
4000720	4005120	trial child-friendly privacy information with different age groups, display transparency
4005120	4010960	information on ability rather than age, you know, so like list at beginner, intermediate,
4010960	4018320	and expert levels, and design different communication methods for how to appropriately
4018320	4024000	relay information or in return gather information from children.
4025680	4030960	They actually even did another thing on here looking this over about guidance to explain
4030960	4038800	how online services will spot detrimental use of children's data. And also the children's code
4038800	4043040	with guidance to help assess the best interest of children. There's another interesting one here
4043040	4051040	about stealth mode with high privacy settings and parental controls. And that's having to,
4051040	4054960	it's something that provides parents with real-time alerts about what their children
4054960	4059520	are playing or how long they've been playing. Or if the, you know, like I said before about
4059520	4065520	the child trying to change the privacy settings or, you know, different things like that.
4066080	4073200	There's also, you know, giving parents the freedom to assess the maturity of their child,
4074320	4081600	you know, and there's also a request to put in like a do not disturb setting,
4083120	4091600	you know, so that it would like not send like friend requests or to say it would disable voice
4092560	4102080	chat or allow only people of the same age group to communicate with children, you know,
4102080	4112480	offering profiling in game. And it's funny on here pushing FOMO. It says it is crucial that
4112480	4117840	games do not use nudge techniques to lead children to make poor privacy decisions.
4117920	4120000	So basically eliminating the fear of missing out.
4121760	4127040	And there's even ones on here where they're requesting people to volunteer as auditors.
4128480	4132880	Oh, that's, that's where these issues get dicey when they invite the community to
4132880	4139840	arbitrate what is and what isn't appropriate. But I look at this more like doing like the Gallup
4139840	4145360	poll. I'm going to put this particular link here in in chat because at my old job when I worked
4145360	4155200	for the money store, I used to help with the Gallup feedback. And one of the good things I
4155200	4162000	like about that is that while this is gathered from communities participating in so such in the
4162000	4170960	other, and getting their opinion, it's something that is used by experts. So it's data, it's
4170960	4176400	information, it's feedback, it's complaining, I fully believe a complaint can be a gift,
4176960	4184080	because it's an opportunity to do better. At the at the same time, I think that the information
4184080	4190560	that comes from surveys like this or from, you know, community auditing should be implemented
4190560	4197200	by the people who are qualified to do so. I will be interesting to see what effect this
4197200	4202480	could have on future game development. There's gonna be something going in as
4202480	4205760	legislation before too long, because you know, people do like to pass their laws.
4206480	4211040	And the UK is tending to regulate a lot of these things stricter than we are over here for sure.
4211040	4215840	So you know, and obviously, the company I work for follows like European standards for privacy.
4215840	4223360	Yeah. Most companies have to. Yeah. So that's why all the websites you go to now, like all of them
4223360	4228880	say like the cookie stuff that all came from the Europe laws, not the US laws. So yeah, and
4228880	4236480	I'm always like, No, I do not want you to target ads or do all this shit. I mean, one one thing I
4236480	4243520	actually super like about because I stopped using Chrome because Chrome is a resource hog. Like for
4243520	4250640	people who open different instances of Chrome or different tabs of Chrome, it is eating your RAM
4250640	4253760	and your processor, not me with five Chrome tabs open right now.
4255920	4262640	I've actually gone back to just using Safari for everything. I mean, and it's not just because,
4263440	4269920	you know, I love my Mac, and it's a native app. But I've really gotten to where I like the fact
4269920	4277440	it records the trackers and blocks the majority of them. I keep ghostery open in the background as
4277440	4288560	well. And it's been between the two of those, I've really just enjoyed the greater sense of
4289200	4298160	privacy I've gotten from it. And, you know, but I when I was on my PC, I was using, I was using
4298160	4304240	Chrome because of the compatibility with stuff, but I started using Opera a lot more. And, you
4304240	4310160	know, and there's also I would even say, and this is going into general tips, make sure that your
4310160	4318160	search engine also has its own privacy protocols in place as well. Like a lot of people are fond
4318160	4326080	of DuckDuckGo. You know, even, you know, if you're really concerned about it, consider investing in
4326080	4337360	a VPN. Pretty cheap now. Yeah, like I have a VPN that I turn on by demand. And usually it's when I
4337360	4341600	want to look at stuff on the BBC website. I had to use one because my Comcast connection was that
4341600	4346720	shitty for playing Final Fantasy 14 at one point. But anyway, I digress. I mean, I have my work VPN
4346720	4353760	for when I work from home, but I really am a bigger advocate now of doing different things.
4353760	4356080	Like since I stopped playing Stadia, I stopped using Chrome.
4358800	4361120	All right. Because Stadia was only working in Chrome.
4361120	4366400	Let's move on, though. We got to get the rest of the news. So let's get to our next story. So
4366400	4369920	funny enough, we brought up AI earlier in the show and now we have another story about AI.
4370800	4378400	Yeah. So there's been a team from the University of Copenhagen who has put together a Mario GPT
4378640	4385920	that can generate levels in Super Mario Brothers based off of a text prompt.
4385920	4390800	It's very rudimentary. You can't actually I don't think you can actually play the levels.
4390800	4398240	It's just more of a graphical representation of them. But, you know, it's apparently the first
4398960	4408880	text to level model in existence. So it's neat. It's not sure what you can really do with this,
4408880	4415360	but it's a neat concept. I guess it's very basic. So like they have like some screenshots of like,
4415360	4419200	you know, many pipes, many enemies, little blocks, low elevation. And you kind of get
4419200	4426480	like a regular level, many pipes, many enemies. And it's all pipes. So not going to replace Mario
4426480	4430720	Maker anytime soon, but it's a neat idea. It's a neat concept.
4432000	4436720	Yeah, it'll be interesting to see like, I mean, I guess we've had games in the past that kind of
4436720	4442400	like use a simple AI to develop levels on the fly like as you're playing them. But it's interesting
4442400	4447200	to see how that might get more complex for a more complex platform or like, you know, a little big
4447200	4454480	planet, little AI planet or whatever that just starts to generate levels. Although not that that
4454480	4459360	means it would be good necessarily, because sometimes AI levels, you can kind of tell
4459360	4464160	they're generated by robot, you know, so. Yeah, it's just a kind of a neat proof of
4464160	4470640	concept right now. Yeah. All right. Well, what was an amazing proof of concept when it came out was
4470640	4475840	the game Tetris Effect. And Tetris Effect has already been re-released as Tetris Effect
4475840	4480560	Connected. And now it's going to be basically getting another big update. They're not giving
4480560	4485280	it a new subtitle, but Tetris Effect Connected will be getting an update alongside the launch
4485280	4492400	of the game on PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation VR 2. It will have some new game modes, which are
4492400	4499360	classic score attack, which looks like the old 1989 Tetris Nintendo game, the official licensed
4499360	4505840	Nintendo game, not the Tengen one. And then there's a version called zone marathon, which is
4505840	4509840	the marathon mode, but with that zone mechanic, which was new to Tetris Effect where you can kind
4509840	4515440	of like freeze things for a little bit. That's all built. That's how you get the 24 line Tetris
4515440	4520480	or whatever, all that stuff that's in the zone stuff. There also is purify mode where you can
4520480	4525200	now do an endless mode and master mode, which also has an endless mode. So there's a whole little
4525200	4530480	video if you want to check out that. But yeah, you can pretty much get this game just about on
4530480	4535680	every game front, including on PC via steam and Epic game store. It's even on quest because it is
4535680	4543360	a VR game. It's it is even on Luna. So Tetris Effect is really everywhere.
4543360	4546800	So now they just did you catch the Tetris movie trailer?
4547360	4553840	I did see the Tetris movie trailer and I was pleasantly surprised that it is not a game where
4553840	4560160	they like, Oh, let's turn Tetris into a movie. It is a movie about the release of the game Tetris
4560480	4566320	that wasn't in the original like, oh, Apple TV got the rights to do a Tetris movie or whatever it was
4566320	4570320	in the beginning. I think a lot of us were assuming they're going to do a movie based on
4570320	4576160	Tetris. That's silly. But now that we see from the trailer, oh, it's about the release of Tetris.
4576160	4581840	And getting that, you know, you know, during that era, especially, you know, in the 80s, when that
4581840	4588880	game came over, getting a Russian game and okay, okay, I get it. It looks interesting. So yeah.
4590400	4595520	Yeah, I saw that shared in our discord. I see some folks in our chat talking about that tire class
4595520	4599280	says that trailer was released. And it's not what you expect. Looks like a fun and entertaining
4599280	4603600	movie, given the circumstances that were involved to bring the game to the US. Yeah, I'm curious if
4603600	4607680	they might get into some of the because you can see that Nintendo is represented in there. I'm
4607680	4612400	curious if they'll get into some of the tengan Atari versus Nintendo stuff when it came to
4612400	4617440	Tetris. I don't know if that's a little too in the weeds for a movie plot, but it'll be interesting.
4618240	4622640	Questbuster says that Tetris trailer was wild, as Joe and Matt says that movie does look
4622640	4629120	interesting. Yeah, so it'll be interesting. And I think streaming is a good place for that.
4629120	4633040	I'm not sure as many people would have ran to the theater to see something like that. I mean,
4633040	4638320	I might have, but I think streaming is a really good place for a movie like that. I think it'll
4638320	4643920	actually catch more eyeballs there than it will with a traditional release. So good on Apple for
4643920	4650320	picking that up. All right, let's move on. Let's move on to a game that maybe more big game
4650320	4659040	developers should pick up. Dark Soccer, I think this one's yours. Yeah, Cocaine Bear. That's all
4659040	4667040	I need to say. A lot of people are talking about this one. I'm probably never going to see it
4667040	4671840	because it honestly sounds like the dumbest thing I've ever heard. That's exactly why we need to see
4671840	4677200	it. Every time I see the trailer, I'm like, if Loki had become a movie director, this is what
4677200	4682240	he would have made. There is enough stupid in my life that I don't need to be adding to it.
4682240	4689600	I love stupid movies. IDGAF. The only way this can get better is if Cocaine Bear can join the
4689600	4695200	Fast and the Furious crew for Fast 11. So that's the only way this can get better. What if they
4695200	4702320	did Cocaine Bear versus Sharknado? I mean, I'm fine with the extended Cocaine Bear universe.
4702320	4708000	What about Cocaine Bearnado? Well, the first movie has to succeed first, and then there will
4708000	4713760	absolutely be a sequel like Cocaine Bear 2 Electric Boogaloo. Absolutely a potential thing
4713760	4723360	if this movie makes a lot of money. Well, at any rate, they're going to be doing a tie-in web-based
4723360	4731280	game called Cocaine Bear 8-Bit Game. If you go to cocainebear.movie.game,
4732320	4740480	then you can play a game as the Cocaine Bear. I think they have the subtitle Rise of the Escobar.
4740480	4749680	Yeah, the play button on this thing is covering the title. But I'm going to look at the game.
4749680	4756800	It's very loud. That's what I found. It's clearly built to play on a phone browser.
4759200	4767920	Also, there's a link on here that I just followed, and apparently Elizabeth Banks has Cocaine Bear's
4767920	4775120	head in her office. I think she's the director. Yeah. Which is hilarious. Not the real Cocaine
4775120	4778720	Bear, but not like a taxidermied head. From the movie.
4779520	4783200	Yeah, but I think that's funny. Tigerclaws says,
4783200	4788000	the movie is loosely based on the true story, but the movie takes huge liberties on the story.
4788560	4791360	I would hope that they do. I hope so. S.G.O. and Hunter Matt
4791360	4796880	does confirm she is the director. She was a great Rita Repulsa for the record. I
4797440	4801920	actually enjoyed that Power Rangers reboot movie, and she did good in that role.
4805760	4812960	By the way, slightly off topic, I watched this thing that I didn't even know was a thing where
4812960	4819120	they had Street Fighter versus Power Rangers, and it was a real Power Rangers thing.
4821360	4827120	It had the actual actors in it and everything, and it was a trip to watch.
4827120	4832960	Well, there's a new Power Rangers thing coming to Netflix that has the actual original...
4832960	4838160	They're in their fucking 50s now doing Power Rangers shit. Although, as we know,
4838160	4843360	the yellow one passed away in a car accident years ago. I think it's like her daughter or...
4843360	4845440	What's his face? Killed himself.
4845440	4848400	Yeah, but he wasn't in the original original, if I remember right.
4848400	4849360	Yeah, he was.
4849360	4852160	Was he? I thought he didn't come out till the next season or something.
4852160	4852960	Green Ranger.
4852960	4862640	Oh, okay. Well, the movie was shot before he passed, so he could be in it in a cameo.
4863200	4866480	He was in the thing that I watched, the Street Fighter thing,
4867920	4872880	so it was a very interesting watch. If I can find it again... This has Ray Liotta in it,
4872880	4873840	Cocaine Bear.
4873840	4881840	Oh, it's got a lot of... This is the year people are just unleashing their pandemic
4884480	4885920	frustrations out on film.
4885920	4886960	Hey, I'll go see it.
4886960	4890240	They need a test, baby, to tighten up the game design in level three,
4890240	4892560	because it froze after I beat it.
4893360	4895120	All right, well, since Star... Oh, go ahead.
4895920	4898240	But at any rate, yeah.
4899280	4903680	Okay, since Star Saga brought up the versus Street Fighter thing, it's a nice little tie
4903680	4907040	into the next story, which has to do with that, right, Loki?
4908400	4911280	This is a fighting game I'd love to see, but instead we're getting a comic
4912080	4914560	or a limited comic series, which is just fine.
4915120	4920480	It is... IDW Comics has announced a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles versus Street Fighter
4921200	4928240	comic crossover event. It's coming May of this year, and it's going to be penned by Paul Allor
4928240	4935280	with art by Ariel Mendel and colors by Sarah Meyers. It'll be a five-issue miniseries,
4935280	4940560	and it's going to have the turtles going toe-to-toe with Ryu, Ken, Chung-Li and Guile.
4942320	4942800	Neat.
4942800	4943840	I want a game now.
4943920	4948240	I know, right? That's where I'm at, is I'm like on it with the Ninja Turtles have had
4948880	4951200	several fighting games. I mean, all from...
4951200	4954000	Or like DLC for Street Fighter 6 or something like that.
4954000	4961280	Yeah, right? So why not? If they're not going to do another Tatsunoko versus Capcom or whatever,
4961280	4965280	why don't we get a TMNT versus Street Fighter? Why not? If we're not going to ever get Tekken
4965280	4970000	versus Street Fighter, well, we got one, we didn't get the other. We got Street Fighter
4970000	4974400	across Tekken, but we never got Tekken across Street Fighter. So why not give us Ninja Turtles?
4974960	4975280	Yeah.
4975280	4981280	I'm here for it. All right, let's talk about a warning, a reminder warning.
4982080	4986800	Oh, one thing. I would love for them to bring in the characters from
4986800	4990720	Tournament Fighter. Wouldn't that be cool?
4993360	4995760	I'm looking in chat for some comments too. DJ Roma S says,
4995760	5000240	I'm friends with Sarah Meyer. Her artwork is amazing. She does the ink work for TMNT
5000240	5004240	Saturday Morning Adventures. Oh, that's pretty cool. And of course, Tiger Claw,
5004240	5007040	I knew Tiger Claw would have something to say about this because I know he loves Ninja Turtles,
5007040	5011120	saying the TMNT in this comic crossover appears to be of the current continuity because we get
5011120	5019600	the fifth turtle, Jenica, on the cover. All right. Well, going over to some stories about Nintendo,
5019600	5021120	the Nintendo, what?
5021760	5028480	Sorry. I was going to say that is one of the best characters to be added into the TMNT continuity
5028480	5033680	because I was reading the comics pretty religiously for a while. Such a good character,
5033680	5034800	but I digress.
5034800	5037920	No, no worries. No worries. All right. Everybody got their Ninja Turtles out of their system? All
5037920	5044240	right. Let me talk about Nintendo changes that they're reminding you of. They've talked about
5044240	5050800	this before, but reminder, as of March 2023, so coming up next month at the end of the month,
5050800	5057360	you will no longer be able to buy Nintendo eShop purchases for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. You cannot
5057360	5063120	download free content. That means no more game demos. Also, related services will cease to
5063120	5068560	function. So some things have already stopped happening. So last year, they yanked the credit
5068560	5076400	card to add funds. They yanked it on the Wii U or 3DS, and then you couldn't use an eShop card
5076400	5082640	anymore at that point. If you link your Nintendo Network ID wallet with your Nintendo account,
5082640	5088400	you can use the shared balance to purchase on any of these systems until March, but after that,
5088400	5094480	they will only work on the Nintendo Switch. Further clarification, which is needed here.
5096560	5103520	The consolidation service, which allows you to merge your eShop balance between the Nintendo
5103520	5110480	account and the Switch eShop, doesn't work anymore after March 2024. So if you have any
5110480	5114240	money sitting on those systems, and now that I think about it, I wonder if I don't just have a
5114240	5119200	couple bucks floating in my wallet or whatever on one of these systems. I think I need to go check
5120160	5125360	just to make sure. I don't think so, but maybe on Wii U. I could see that maybe I had some points
5125360	5131760	left over or something there. But as of March 2024, you can't even combine the accounts
5131760	5136560	anymore. Why we had separate accounts for all this shit in the first place, I will never
5136560	5143520	understand. But I digress. After all, Microsoft and Sony have kept the same network ever since
5143520	5152800	the Xbox era. Xbox, 360, One. They've all used the same network, but I digress. Nintendo always
5152800	5157760	does things a little bit differently, don't they? But this is a good reminder. Check your Wii U
5157760	5166720	balances. Check all that stuff. Make sure they work. Mike Def says get that Pokemon bank and
5166720	5172400	transporter. If you ever want to pull your Pokemon off the DS, download that still while it's still
5172400	5178480	free before it doesn't work anymore. So great call out there for sure. Hopefully the bank will
5178480	5182240	continue to work even if the rest of Nintendo's online stuff doesn't. But I guess maybe because
5182240	5187120	that's all through the Pokemon company, they may operate that a little differently. So it'd be
5187120	5194080	interesting to see. All right. Well, let's go into our next segment to celebrate something
5194080	5209680	that hopefully will not be pulled in the year 2024. And now it's time to travel back to a
5209680	5215600	simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's
5215600	5222720	time for the Classic Game of the Week. All right, in Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight?
5224960	5231600	I picked After Burner Climax. And I love the music in this game.
5232240	5236000	Let me play a little bit of it in the background so our podcast folks can hear
5236720	5242800	as well as the live folks here. It's freaking After Burner. But at any rate,
5243600	5251280	After Burner Climax is another game in the After Burner series. It was released in arcades in 2006
5251280	5259920	and then had releases for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in April 2010. And you remember when we would go
5259920	5268640	to was it Mike's incredibly mediocre pizza? John's incredibly shitty pizza.
5269360	5272800	Yeah, that was it. Well, mediocre. There were some good ones.
5273920	5276160	I'm going to step away from keyboard for a minute while you finish saying it.
5277520	5284480	Well, at any rate, I would pretty much be lying toward this and Deadstorm Pirates.
5285280	5293520	So I love After Burner Climax. And, you know, just like the earlier incarnations of After Burner,
5293600	5304960	the Deluxe After Burner Climax cabinet had a servo cook chair that you could also use a button to
5304960	5313200	keep it locked in the static position. And it would like completely move around as you played
5313200	5318400	if you didn't use that. There were other cabinet versions that had a commander version, which tilts
5318400	5323280	side to side and the standard version that doesn't move at all. The deluxe cabinet had
5323280	5331840	a widescreen LCD monitor while the standard and commander had a 29 inch CRT. The digital version
5331840	5337200	actually has been delisted from Xbox Live and PlayStation tour as of December 2014
5337840	5342960	and was removed from all the storefronts in May 2015. There is a mobile version that was
5342960	5349760	re-released via the Sega Forever service in April 2019, but that's also gone.
5350400	5358960	At any rate, with After Burner Climax, it introduced two different aircraft,
5359520	5368720	the F-A-18E Super Hornet and the F-15E Strike Eagle. The original F-14 Tomcat that had been,
5368720	5373040	you know, the mainstay of the series was replaced with the F-14D Super Tomcat.
5373680	5380000	All of these are real planes, by the way, so I think that was cool. I think that they modeled
5380000	5388720	them really nicely. It's just, you know, my problem with After Burner is because of the way that
5388720	5396000	you're playing moves never felt really realistic. But at the same time, this game is, it's a lot
5396000	5401120	different when you're actually playing it on one of the deluxe caps. Anyway, when you choose your
5401120	5407120	plane, you can use the throttle to choose between four different paint jobs on your planes. You have
5407120	5415840	a standard, a camo, a special and a low visibility scheme. After you choose that, you can also choose
5415840	5423600	to listen to the After Burner Climax music or the original soundtrack from After Burner 2 by
5423600	5431600	holding the throttle back and hitting the missile button. I mean, it's really very, I'm gonna say,
5431600	5437600	you know, that the game, you know, is very straightforward. You know, you pew pew things.
5437600	5442400	It's got like a lock-in system on there. You can shoot your missiles. You've got a limited
5442400	5452720	number of your missiles, just like any, you know, fighter jet would. But it's so funny,
5452720	5457360	like the original After Burner, we had one at Scandia for a while. You remember?
5460640	5465920	I remember that. I do. I don't remember that, unfortunately. I used to get super motion sick
5465920	5474480	on it, but because it was the shifting circle kind of one. But the moving chair ones, I actually
5474480	5479600	never got so sick on. I used to play a lot of Starblade, remember? I only remember them having
5479600	5484640	the After Burner cabinet. It was either at Disneyland or at Great America. One of the
5484640	5488800	arcades had it. I think the Great America arcade that had that Galaxian 3 or whatever.
5490240	5494320	The last time I went to Great America, they had a Planet Harriers.
5495040	5502400	And you couldn't get me off of that machine. I was in love. But going back to After Burner Climax,
5503360	5510800	this was going on when there was this sort of renaissance for the classic SEGA titles.
5511680	5518160	So a little bit more behind this one. It was developed by SEGA AM2, you know, so it was the
5518160	5531840	big arcade group for SEGA. Art done by Aoki Seiji, programmed by Sumi Masayuki. It is
5532480	5538560	just a great game. I hate that all the home versions have been delisted.
5542000	5549040	Also, as far as the system it was released on, it was on the SEGA Lindbergh system
5549920	5558240	that used a 3 gigahertz Pentium 4 CPU, 1 gigabyte of RAM, and an NVIDIA GPU,
5560000	5568720	and an internal GPD ROM system. And this was the same one that Initial D arcade stage 4,
5570720	5576560	House of the Dead 4, Virtua Tennis 3, Virtua Fighter 5, and the cancelled Syfy.
5580000	5586160	So their current one, House of the Dead Scarlet Dawn, is on, I think this last one was an Unreal
5586160	5594560	4 based one. But at any rate, I mean, it's just sort of fun going back and seeing what these ran
5594560	5603920	on and, you know, seeing where the technology has come from. Because the one that came after
5603920	5613840	that was the Europa R that SEGA Rally 3 played on. But at any rate, it's just kind of neat seeing
5613840	5618880	how the technology has gone. Because this game, even today I would think, this game looks pretty
5618880	5623360	fantastic. Yeah, it's still a great looking game, especially with how fast it moves, right?
5623360	5630400	Reminds me of an F-Zero, but in the sky. Well, and you know where else the climax name has been
5630400	5638720	used was in Bayonetta. When the After Burner theme was the climax version,
5641360	5645360	there was, wasn't there also the one thing where you could switch her from
5646160	5653920	After Burner to a different shooter? Like if you had some outfit equipped?
5654080	5659520	I don't remember. Somebody in chat might speak up. Yeah, but my favorite thing though is that when
5659520	5665920	she, there was, I think it was also like a Space Harrier one for her, but I love how she says,
5665920	5673440	welcome to my fantasy zone. Yeah, yeah, it was Star Fox. That was the first switch.
5674320	5680400	If you had like the Fox McCloud outfit equipped, that when you played through that scene you'd
5680400	5689440	play as an Arwing. I didn't know that. It's neat. Yeah. But at any rate, it's a great game.
5690320	5697920	I still love to this day playing it in the arcade. So yeah, you know what I wish that they would have
5697920	5704400	done with me? I've done a fantasy zone climax. Well, it's never too late, right? There was the
5704400	5709920	SEGA ages re-releases, but I mean, heck I would, I'd have that in a heartbeat.
5711360	5716000	All right, there it is. SEGA, bring us Planet Harriers at home, the end.com.
5716960	5723200	Your classic of the week, After Burner Climax. Great arcade game that was very impressive and
5723200	5728400	yeah, really does still kind of hold up today. Bonds 006 says, this is the game that is the
5728640	5734480	reason I play Ace Combat. So, you know, people get started on the genre in one place and end up
5734480	5740080	playing other stuff. So awesome, awesome. All right, not everyone can be perfect. All right,
5740080	5744880	let's move on and travel around the world quickly with some rapid fire news and then we'll do some
5744880	5750160	release dates as well. But let's do rapid fire news first, Loki. Speaking of Ace Combat, if you
5750160	5755920	want to play that and you're a premium or extra subscriber of PlayStation Plus, you're going to
5756000	5762720	extra subscriber of PlayStation Plus, you can do that as part of their game catalog in February.
5762720	5770080	They're actually offering Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown for PlayStation 4. On PlayStation 5 and
5770080	5774960	PlayStation 4, Borderlands 3 is coming as well. One of my favorites, Earth Defense Force 5 for
5774960	5782160	PlayStation 4, The Forgotten City on PlayStation 5 and 4, Horizon Forbidden West on 5 and 4,
5782160	5792720	I Am Setsuna on PlayStation 4, Lost Sphear, Oninaki both on PlayStation 4, Outriders on PS4 and PS5,
5792720	5800160	The Quarry on both, Resident Evil 7 Biohazard on PlayStation 4, Scarlet Nexus on 5 and 4,
5800160	5806720	and Tekken 7 on 4. And then of the classic catalog, they're giving you Harvest Moon
5806720	5812080	Back to Nature, Legend of Dragoon and Wild Arms 2 on the original PlayStation.
5812080	5813920	I'm sorry, did someone say Legend of Dragoon?
5815120	5815840	Yes.
5815840	5817200	That is an attention grabber.
5818160	5823200	And then also PlayStation 4, Destroy All Humans. I'm assuming this is the remake
5824160	5830000	that is part of the classic catalog there. And then this is a surprising bit of news,
5830000	5833520	considering all of the delay news we hear, especially around Dead Island 2,
5833520	5838880	but Dead Island 2 has gone gold. And in fact, they have moved up their release date one week
5838880	5842000	to April 21st, 2023. So.
5843520	5847920	Cool, it's coming. It'll be here soon. No more delays.
5848560	5852560	Only like 10 years after the first game, but all right. I hope it's good.
5852560	5854240	Better late than never, I guess.
5854240	5855920	Yeah, hope it's good. Hope it's worth the wait.
5857440	5860080	All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
5860080	5867680	Oh, my artistic hero, the man himself, Amano Yoshitaka.
5870080	5880560	He is doing the cover for the DLC soundtracks that are coming with the first-run copies of
5880560	5886560	Cuphead's Japanese physical edition. I was looking at the price. It's like 40 bucks,
5886560	5891120	which isn't bad, but then the shipping is also 40 bucks, which is bad.
5892000	5895920	And I want this so much. Oh, the artwork looks so good,
5896640	5905440	but it's playing homage to the classic fantasy RPGs. It's absolutely beautiful artwork.
5905440	5912480	There's been samples of it posted on the Twitters, but I love him.
5913120	5916480	Yeah, it's really cute. For those that are watching on Twitch,
5916480	5919440	we're trying to put some of that up on stream so you can kind of see what we're talking about.
5919440	5925200	It is very impressive, obviously. Yeah, but I mean, keep in mind that
5925200	5933680	it is because of this man that we have Power Rangers. Well, okay. He did the designs for
5933680	5939040	Science Ninja Team Gatchaman when he was doing work for Tatunoko. He did the character designs
5939040	5947920	for my favorite anime in the universe. And it was from that series that the idea for doing
5947920	5955600	live-action Sentai came out. So we indirectly have him to thank for Power Rangers. But I mean,
5956720	5965760	he also did an illustration for Vampire Hunter D novels and worked on Demon City Shinjuku. I mean,
5966480	5975200	this guy and his other artwork is absolutely astounding. I have an art book this thick of
5975200	5983520	his work. And I need every little single piece of his artwork I can get my grubby little fingers on.
5985120	5989120	All right. Well, of course, obviously Amano is also very much known for his work with the
5989120	5993120	Final Fantasy series. And we've been getting a lot of interesting Final Fantasy tidbits this year,
5993120	5998000	not just with game releases like Theatrhythm and, you know, the upcoming Final Fantasy
5998000	6005120	Pixel Remaster release on consoles. But we know that Final Fantasy 7 also supposedly getting the
6005120	6010080	second chapter in the Rebirth series, or excuse me, the second chapter of the remake series
6010080	6014640	Rebirth is also supposed to be this year. Square Enix has been sharing some insight to Final
6014640	6019200	Fantasy 7's development, kind of talking a little bit about, you know, what maybe some of the
6019200	6023840	original plans were for the game. I feel like we knew this, like this had been said in an interview
6023840	6029040	before, but the development team did share that the original plan for Final Fantasy 7 was that
6029040	6034800	the game was going to take place in New York City. I thought I remember something about some of that
6034800	6040320	spinning off into what eventually became Parasite Eve, but I digress. So the game was originally
6040320	6044640	going to take place in New York City. The story was a little bit different, but there were some
6044640	6049600	elements that were the same. In the original story, Detective Joe, whoever that is, not Cloud,
6049600	6055600	but Detective Joe was going to be investigating the group that was looking to destroy the Mako
6055600	6061440	reactors. So that whole part, you know, with the Mako reactors and, you know, people wanting to
6061440	6066960	blow it up for their reasons to save the planet, probably, like it was in the Final Fantasy 7 game,
6066960	6072480	probably tied into the original 7. So interesting. One of the members in the group went through some
6072480	6079520	different changes. That character eventually became Cloud Strife. So who knows? I mean,
6079520	6084880	I don't know if Parasite Eve took more of that original idea. I don't know. I think maybe just
6085440	6089440	maybe some of the graphics for New York, who knows? But it's kind of interesting that that's
6089440	6094640	where Final Fantasy 7 started. And so if you were seeing parallels between Midgar and a big
6094640	6102480	metropolis like New York City, you're not wrong. There's also that. So all right, let's check out
6102480	6107120	some games that are coming out this week. I don't think we have the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but we
6107120	6110400	have some other games that maybe you can look forward to this week. Loki.
6111120	6117040	Yes, like Atomic Heart, which is going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and
6117040	6126240	Xbox Series. Like a Dragon, Isshin on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6127200	6132640	Seven Doors, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6133280	6140640	Digimon World Next Order on PC and Nintendo Switch. Then it looks like we're getting into
6141120	6147520	the PlayStation VR stuff. We have Horizon Call of the Mountain on PlayStation 5 or PlayStation VR 2
6147520	6157920	actually. Kazuni AI, Touch of the Beat on PlayStation 5. Redemption Reapers on PC, Nintendo
6157920	6166320	Switch and PlayStation 4. Blood Bowl 3 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox
6167120	6174240	Series. Company of Heroes 3 on PC. Grimm Guardians, Demon Purge on PC, Nintendo Switch,
6174240	6180880	PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. And then we have Raiden 3 Cross,
6180880	6189520	Mikado Maniacs on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6190720	6193120	Cliven Wrench That came close to importing that one.
6193520	6194320	Matt
6194320	6196000	What's Mikado Maniacs?
6196000	6199120	Danielle Mikado is a music studio.
6199120	6201040	Matt Hmm, that'd be cool.
6201040	6205440	Danielle And it's supposed to have a pretty killer soundtrack. I mean,
6205440	6208720	Raiden 3 was pretty mediocre as far as the Raiden games go.
6209440	6214160	But the Mikado studio has done some amazing music.
6214160	6219680	Matt Cliven Wrench on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6219680	6229240	and we've got a couple more here. Kirby's Return to Dreamland deluxe on Nintendo Switch and last
6229240	6236960	but not least Octopath Traveler 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. That's it.
6236960	6240760	All right, let's travel over to Japan. I feel like we've had some light release weeks in Japan
6240760	6246080	lately. This week, very much not the case. We have a lot of shit coming out in Japan this week. So,
6246840	6252000	pull up a chair. Here we go on the Nintendo Switch. Oita Beppu Mystery Guide, the Warped Bamboo
6252000	6256640	Lantern is out on the switch this week. The Ultimate Wonder Boy Collection. I was looking at
6256640	6260560	this because I was wondering if it was just another rerelease of the Dragon's Trap and it is,
6260680	6265760	but there's it has Wonder Boy, Wonder Boy Monster Land, Dragon's Trap, Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair,
6265880	6271840	Wonder Boy 5, Wonder Boy 4, or excuse me, Monster World 4 is in there too. It's very, very busy with
6272480	6278160	Wonder Boy games. So if you are a fan of that series, there's that for you. Digimon World Next
6278160	6285200	Order has its release, the international edition in Japan this week as well. Akatsuki Yureyu Koi
6285240	6290400	Akari is out in a regular and limited edition this week. Sakura Moyu as the Knight's
6290400	6294920	Reincarnation is out in a regular and limited edition this week as well on the switch. Koi
6294920	6303560	Suro Kanojo Nu No Bukkyo Na Butai is out in a regular and limited edition this week in Japan.
6304560	6313080	Yep. Omoide Kakaete Ai No Koi is out this week as well in a regular and
6313080	6313840	I'm like a dating sim.
6313880	6317120	And audience, limited edition. Yes, it is.
6319280	6320520	I'm gonna keep guessing.
6320560	6326080	Okay, let's see. Other games we have the Crimson Flower That Divides Us Lunar Coupling is out in
6326080	6337120	Japan on the 23rd. That same Raiden 3 Cross Mikado Maniacs is out. Hakuoki Remeroku is out as well
6337120	6344240	this week in Japan. And of course, Octopath Traveler 2 does get a Japanese release. And of
6344240	6349320	course that Kirby game also getting released in Japan as well. And if you were waiting for this
6349320	6354200	on the switch in Japan, guess what? You can finally play Ark Survival Evolved in a physical
6354200	6362560	edition on this switch this week in Japan. How about the PlayStation 5 now? The PlayStation VR 2
6362640	6366480	is released this week. That is worth noting. So if you want to pick that up, and then that would
6366480	6370440	mean a lot of the stuff that comes with it, including the Horizon Call the Mountain, the
6370440	6376200	charging station. That same Raiden 3 crossover game is also out on the PlayStation 5 if you'd
6376200	6381880	rather play it there. Tortuga A Pirate's Tale also out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.
6382200	6388680	Octopath Traveler 2 also out on the PlayStation 5. What did I tell you? A busy week. How about the UK?
6390040	6399680	Well, on the 21st, we have Like a Dragon Isshin. That's for PlayStation and Xbox. Likewise, we have
6399680	6409480	Atomic Heart. On the 22nd for Switch, we have Digimon World Next Order. On the 23rd, for the
6409480	6418160	big three consoles, we have Blood Bowl 3 Brutal Edition. For PC, Company of Heroes 3 for PlayStation
6418160	6426520	and Switch, My Life Pet Vet. Moving on to the 24th, we have Do Not Open for PlayStation for
6426520	6435880	Switch, SpongeBob SquarePants Crusty Cook-Off. That sounds completely horrifying. On PlayStation, we
6435880	6443960	have Broken Pieces, PlayStation Xbox, Hunt Showdown, Limited Bounty Hunter Edition. For Switch
6443960	6453000	and PlayStation, Octopath Traveler 2. For Switch, Kirby Return to Dreamland Deluxe. On the 24th also
6453000	6459560	for PlayStation and Switch, Crazy Chicken Traps and Treasures. For the big three, we have Clive
6459560	6467320	and Wrench, and that's it for the week. All right, we have a few more stories, then we're going to get
6467320	6472600	to the listener roundtable. We do have an email tonight, finally bucking the trend of the past,
6472600	6478920	what, two months. So that's exciting. Spirit Gasp here. So we'll also get to your comments and maybe
6478920	6484760	your phone calls if we have time as well over on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6484760	6488600	But first, we have a few more stories for you. Let's go back to Loki.
6489640	6495960	So we talked last week how there's going to be this big update for Team Fortress 2. Well,
6495960	6501400	apparently they've started to walk back the expectations for that. So they've changed
6501400	6508360	a little bit of the passage that was in their update. So it previously read, you know, the last
6508360	6514760	few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates, but this year we're playing a full
6515560	6521240	on update size update with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and who knows what
6521240	6528600	else, which means we need Steam Workshop content, your Steam Workshop content. And now it says,
6528600	6532520	you know, the last Team Fortress summer updates have only been item updates, but this year we're
6532520	6540360	playing a full on holiday sized update. I don't know what that means as far as different. With
6540360	6545480	items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and other community contributed fixes for the
6545480	6552760	game, which means we need your Steam Workshop content, your Steam Workshop content, which
6552760	6559960	I mean, originally it sounded like that, you know, they were incorporating Steam Workshop stuff into
6559960	6564120	the game update, but now it's like, no, it's only going to be Steam Workshop content.
6565160	6569080	We were just gathering and putting it out as a free update, even though you've made all the
6569080	6579960	stuff for it. Oh, well. It's a really old game. Like, I don't expect them to be publishing more
6579960	6584520	stuff for it. We could just make a Team Fortress 3 if y'all weren't allergic to the number three.
6585480	6586440	I can't do that.
6588440	6589480	Snow three evolve.
6590760	6595640	Speaking of allergies, I am definitely allergic to this trend in the gaming community, DarkSakura.
6599480	6603640	Squenix is not learning anything. They're not listening to people and they're not learning.
6604840	6610280	They announced very recently that they are launching their NFT based game,
6610840	6620200	Symbiogenesis, Symbiogenesis on a site called Polygon, which is an Ethereum scaling network.
6621240	6627000	It was announced last November. And then, and back then they said that story driven collectibles
6628760	6634280	were of course at the heart of it and that they plan to launch on Ethereum. But now they say
6634280	6640680	they're using Polygon instead that uses a side chain to basically deal in faster and cheaper
6640680	6647160	transactions than the Ethereum's network, well, their own main net can handle. They
6648920	6656040	were also interested in the lower fees in general, going back to make it a little bit cheaper.
6656840	6663560	And they wanted to offer what they call a unique experience to Web3
6663560	6669000	fans. This is stated by the game producer Tamate Nalyuki.
6672840	6678440	They put some more details out. It's going to be built around 10,000 character NFTs that are tied
6678440	6683960	to game mechanics. Although there are other entities used in the game, according to their
6683960	6689080	document that they released to Polygon Labs, owning a character NFT is not required to play
6689080	6696440	the game, although it adds unspecified extra value to the experience. Character NFT holders
6696440	6702520	can create replica NFTs to share story information with other characters. The game will be taking
6702520	6710200	a place on a floating continent above a polluted future earth with a society forced to band
6710200	6718920	together to keep a dragon away from their floating home. It is turn-based gameplay tied to the
6718920	6727800	storyline. Different paths go with different missions and either holding or trading NFTs.
6728360	6733400	They showed some of the NFT items that included dragon tarot cards and the monster storybook.
6733960	6740520	There's no more actual details out. But I can tell you, I'm...
6742600	6752040	No. And they've been investing in this Ethereum sandbox and they also announced that they were
6752040	6758920	going to revive Dungeon Siege, the franchise. That better not be coming out as an NFT thing.
6759880	6763480	Dungeon Siege wasn't bad, but if it's all going to be NFT crap, then forget it.
6764120	6767880	Wasn't their last version of the Dungeon Siege game that they did was Awful 2?
6768760	6770600	Dungeon Siege 3? I didn't think it was that bad.
6772360	6775560	No, I'm thinking of a different game. I'm thinking of Dungeon Keeper.
6775560	6780760	Oh, yeah. So here's the question I have about this game. Let's take a look at another Square
6780760	6785160	Enix title real quick. I want to know, does the NFT game, what's it called? Symbiogenesis?
6785800	6788120	Does Symbiogenesis last...
6788120	6789000	Be a genus.
6789000	6796920	Sorry. Whatever it's called. Does it last longer or shorter than Babylon's Fall?
6798120	6801960	For the record, which by the way, this is a timely question because in case you forgot,
6802520	6810600	Babylon's Fall was released on March 3rd, 2022. The servers are being shut down on Thursday,
6810600	6818120	February 23rd. So this is actually timely. R.I.P. Babylon's Fall. Literal P. Rest in it.
6819560	6829800	So Babylon's Fall lasted 51 weeks. Does Symbiogenesis go,
6830680	6835480	we're going to play Price is Right, higher than or lower than 51 weeks?
6836840	6837320	Lower.
6837320	6845320	Well, there's another thing, too, that people need to keep in mind. So in last May's,
6845320	6852600	Gwenix sold off a bunch of their studios and franchises, including Tomb Raider. And they used
6852600	6861480	the roughly 300 million that they got to start supporting this Web3 experience as far, and also
6861480	6869320	some other business ventures. So if this flops the way we think it will, Gwenix is going to be
6870600	6872920	not just in P, they're going to be in deep shit.
6872920	6877480	This is why I made the prediction I did at the beginning of the year that the current CEO of
6877480	6884040	Square Enix is not going to make it through the year as CEO. And this is another fantastic
6884040	6889080	example because when this game is an embarrassment and ends up lasting less than 51 weeks, which is
6889080	6898200	where I'm going to hedge my bet, it's over. Questbuster in chat says, Rob not pulling any
6898200	6902600	punches. You know what? I don't have time for NFTs and neither does anyone else.
6902600	6903960	We're too old for this shit.
6903960	6908520	Yeah, exactly. I'm too old for this shit. And yeah, that's money that could have gone
6908520	6914280	towards the development of putting more theater rhythm songs into theater the final bar line.
6914920	6916120	Bro, don't even.
6917320	6917720	All right.
6918280	6923720	Oh my God. They could have used that money to license Angela Aki. I'm just saying.
6923720	6929400	You know what's not in theater the final bar line? Babylon's fall.
6929400	6930600	My butt.
6930600	6933640	All right. Loki, what do you have for us?
6935320	6945240	Yes, it's another person being fired for sexual misconduct allegations. So Genshin Impact voice
6945240	6955480	actor Elliot Gindi is no longer going to be voicing, I guess, Tignari because apparently,
6955480	6960360	you know, they said after communications with voice recording agency, we hereby confirm that
6960360	6966760	Elliot Gindi and the English voice actor for Tignari will no longer be voicing the character
6966760	6972680	in subsequent versions due to breach of contract. I guess that contract is, you know, sexual
6972680	6978840	allegations. Yeah, President, we are communicating with the voice recording agency regarding the
6978840	6985720	matter and casting a rerecording will gradually replace a Tignari's existing in game voice lines
6985720	6990360	and issue these updates in a corresponding announcement. Thank you for your support.
6990360	6992040	So he's being removed, removed.
6993000	6997800	Yeah, there's that one. I remember the other game was that they were doing that with too.
6997800	6999960	They recast and redid all the voice lines.
6999960	7007000	Destiny 2. Remember, the guy from Game of Thrones used to be the little AI thing.
7007000	7011960	And they know it wasn't the same reason, but they did do that.
7011960	7018600	No, there was another one that was actually for this type of thing. I think. I want to say it was
7018600	7026360	in like a dragon, but I don't remember. I don't remember or one of the Yakuza games. I don't
7026360	7032760	remember now. I don't remember. I remember. Yeah, it's annoying to still see, you know,
7034200	7037560	this type of thing happening in the industry, but they're addressing it.
7037560	7042120	Quest Buster does point out miHoYo did the same thing with another character in 2021. This might
7042120	7046520	be why this sounds familiar, but it was when a Chinese voice actor was erased for similar
7046520	7053800	behavior while he was married, by the way. So, Dr. Sia says judgment the Yakuza spinoff game.
7054680	7055480	That's what it was.
7055720	7059000	Yeah. Yeah. Now that I think about it, I do remember a story about that, too,
7059000	7063640	had something like that. That's right. It sure did. The actor got busted for drugs,
7063640	7068120	so they had to replace him because that's what it was. It's a huge, huge issue in
7069160	7076920	certain countries. So, yeah. Interesting. All right. And then DGRMS about this particular
7076920	7081560	article says this guy is from my neck of the woods. Fuck that guy. The whole Elliott
7081560	7088920	Gindi drama goes very deep. That's all I will say. All right. Well, another chat that was said
7088920	7093880	earlier in chat was SG100Matt saying it all comes back to Theatrhythm. And it sure does,
7093880	7100600	because guess what I have for the last story tonight? Theatrhythm rumors, but with substance
7100600	7107080	to it, because it's a quote that was said. There's some press interviews going on with
7107080	7113240	producer Ichiro Hazama and director Masanobu Suzui, who are promoting Theatrhythm in the
7113240	7117880	various gaming press right now. But they are taking questions about what could be in the
7117880	7124760	future for the series. And the team has actually said they'd love to work with franchises like
7124760	7131880	Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem, and Pokemon. The developers would like to work with
7131880	7136280	Nintendo on the installment, and there's certainly the music there to do it. I mean, all they would
7136280	7140600	have to do is like a Theatrhythm Super Smash Brothers, because I think about like how Super
7140600	7145720	Smash Brothers has the players in it that the audio players that have a very rich Nintendo
7145720	7153000	soundtrack in them. So to this entire story, I really just say please. What I thought was
7153000	7157880	interesting is that in a comment to this story on Go Nintendo, I thought this was an interesting
7157880	7164200	take on it a comment I hear I don't usually read the comments. But here is like the one time in
7164200	7170040	internet history where I found the comment interesting. And the user said, as neat as the
7170040	7176600	Square Nintendo crossover rhythm game can be, Nintendo can just revive elite beat agents,
7176600	7181240	or make a spin off of EBA that focuses on Nintendo music only. Like you can play along to
7181240	7184760	a Mario theme and in the background, there could be a mini story of Mario rescuing Peach from
7184760	7189560	browser again, and etc. So basically, this commenter is saying, you know, Nintendo could
7189560	7193240	just kind of take the idea and make it their own because it wasn't that dissimilar in the first
7193240	7197240	place from what elite beat agents was. I thought that was an interesting take on it.
7198200	7200520	They can have the art style be like Paper Mario.
7200520	7205480	Yeah. Mike Defton chat says, give me pokey rhythm, please. You know what's interesting?
7206200	7213560	If I recall right, was it I don't think it was the Pokemon company, but it was maybe it was the
7213560	7219640	Pokemon company. There was that game Harmonite that was made by the people that make Pokemon.
7219640	7225320	It was very different type of game. But that was on the 3DS. It hadn't I mean, it was removed from
7225320	7228520	Pokemon. I didn't actually have the music in it or anything. But it was like a music game. It's just
7228520	7232920	something that comes to mind when you kind of bring up the pokey rhythm. So is that Harmonite
7232920	7240040	was the thing. So d'Artussia says I definitely do the Zelda course first. Yeah. And, you know,
7240040	7245160	Crypt of the NecroDancer is the thing. So it's not like Nintendo is closed off to letting other
7245160	7252280	companies have their IPs in interesting ways. So that could be very interesting. Jason says,
7252280	7257640	Thea Trithym is the intro read and the last story lol. The way it ought to be tbh. Oh,
7257640	7262520	and Deft confirms Harmonite did have Pokemon music in it. Oh, I stand corrected. Perfect.
7264040	7269800	All right. Let's get to the listener roundtable. We invite your participation every week via chat.
7269800	7274520	If you have a question for us in chat, via Discord, which you can join our Discord over
7274520	7280920	at vog at network.com slash discord, and our email bag so you can go to participate at orange
7280920	7287480	laundry do calm if you want to send us an email, which someone finally did this week. Let's get to
7287480	7294040	the email because it's gonna be an interesting one. It's a doozy. It's a doozy. So let's get
7294040	7301320	this is a topic. Well, I'll, I'll say my thoughts once Jamie's read it. And I'm permitting this one
7301320	7307880	because of the nature of the discussion that it will provoke. So hello, or after witnessing some
7307880	7314920	fallout yesterday from a Final Fantasy 14 streamer trying out Hogwarts legacy. I wanted to ask you
7314920	7319160	all how you feel about the situation where anyone who streams the game gets a swarm of people
7319160	7325800	harassing them over it. First off, I 100% support those who refuse to purchase the game or watch any
7325800	7331400	content from it. She who will not be named is a scummy individual to put it lightly.
7331400	7337320	Now it seems that anyone who has any Harry Potter fondness or plays this game is immediately labeled
7337320	7343400	as hateful, a bigot or transphobic. I grew up reading slash watching Harry Potter, and have
7343400	7349640	been curious about the game haven't bought it. But as someone who was the victim of harassment
7349640	7355240	to the point of where I almost made an irreversible decision, it's really hard for me
7355240	7361320	to stand by and say that this retaliation is okay. trans people from around the world have had to
7361320	7369000	endure harassment their entire lives. I understand that. But this isn't but but this isn't right to
7369000	7375160	fight hate with hate and risk what that we lose others. I know Jamie said that she didn't want
7375160	7380600	to cover anything Hogwarts legacy related on the show. So if you choose to bypass this email,
7380600	7386120	I understand. I just wanted to express my concerns in the only way I can and that Twitter
7386120	7393400	sure as shit isn't going to allow. Love you guys. Garth Wolf. Yeah, um,
7395400	7398040	I've thought long and hard about this one. Um,
7399000	7408760	because I only have one friend, one person that I have retained followship of, who was playing this
7408760	7418760	game. And the biggest thing that I see is that, well, first of all, I've been seeing a lot of just
7418760	7431320	really terrible. I would say conservative people using this game to express their anti trans
7431320	7440120	sentiment. I am including that particular voice actor, who, while I love his voice,
7440120	7447160	and I love a certain character that he voiced, he is a piece of shit human. And he is friends
7447160	7458280	with the other piece of shit human. I loved the franchise. It came out at a really difficult time
7458280	7465480	in my life. I actually still have my books. I'm sorry, I imported my books. And I spent a lot of
7465480	7472360	money on them. And I'm not one to throw away literature or anything really if I spent money
7472360	7476840	on it because the money was already spent before I knew anything. That being said,
7478520	7485400	I am not buying the game. I haven't bought any, the very last thing I ever bought was a Slytherin
7485400	7493960	mug, like years ago. And that's the last time I've bought anything. But it doesn't mean that I don't
7493960	7499240	love the stories that we're told. I don't love the characters. I mean, I'm gonna say it. She's
7499240	7505240	a great author. She wrote really good stuff. And, and there are lots of parallels that people have
7505240	7511400	seen, that links back to their own experience as a marginalized or misunderstood person.
7512200	7519800	You know, but then when you go and you see the motivation that this person has, and how
7520440	7527240	a lot of this has been sneaking into her later work on top of it, it just, it's completely
7527240	7533800	soured it for me. It doesn't mean that I don't, you know, love and identify with the stories and
7533800	7540680	characters, but it also means that there's a part of it that's been very tarnished for me.
7542440	7547160	And the only way that, you know, a person in my position can really do something about it is to,
7547160	7554600	number one, speak out. Number two, vote with my dollars. I still won't go to Universal.
7555240	7560920	I won't go to the Nintendo thing at Universal because it's contributing money back to her
7560920	7567000	franchise because I'm sure as we know that when you pay for franchising, you're, you're paying
7567000	7571560	like a flat rate to maintain that license. I didn't mean franchising, I meant licensing.
7572920	7578200	So it's not like I think she's getting like active royalties every time a ticket is sold.
7578200	7585560	I think she's already been paid and she's going to get paid again. So going back to this,
7589800	7595320	as far as the harassment side of everything goes, there's a fair point that Garth made that our
7595320	7601960	trans friends have been living with this sort of hateful discrimination their entire lives. And
7601960	7610680	I'm even throwing in the internalized transphobia that society has inflicted upon them and taught
7610680	7617560	them that how they feel is wrong, that you're just confused or, you know, and anything for anyone on
7617560	7627560	the queer spectrum, you know. I've had it as an ace person. I know we've all experienced this
7627560	7636840	sense about ourselves when something doesn't conform to the default of, you know, what our
7636840	7650760	current society has inflicted upon us. But as far as going in to someone else's chat room
7651400	7659000	while they're streaming the game and being nasty and being abusive,
7660840	7665800	I have learned, if anything, this is just going to make somebody double down more
7665800	7669800	and it's going to close them off from a willingness to be educated about it.
7670120	7684760	I prefer that, especially if it's a friend of mine, you know, like this particular friend,
7684760	7691720	I happened to be in DBD chat when the discussion came up and I flat out said,
7692680	7698600	I love you. I will not watch when you play this game. I will not give any revenue,
7700280	7705640	any, you know, I have Twitch turbos besides appointments. I wouldn't, you know,
7705640	7712280	watch any ads during that time. I would not participate in the stream. I would actively
7712920	7718840	not participate. And she's like, I get it. And she's like, I get why people
7719800	7726920	are acting this way while people, you know, feel this about the game. I don't know that
7727800	7736680	this person 100% understands that point of view. And I've tried to be as gently
7736680	7744680	educational about it as I can, but I also feel that in this, the way things are, and this is
7744680	7753960	not just dealing with our trans friends or LGBTQ plus issues or, or, you know, even issues of,
7753960	7760440	of race, you know, people of color having to explain why something is considered racist
7760440	7766200	or something like that, that you also have to have a willingness to go out and be educated.
7767080	7774440	You know, you can't put the burden of education on somebody who is in that group.
7776280	7779320	You know, you shouldn't make them do the emotional labor
7780760	7787160	of having to be the one to educate you. I guarantee you, if you talk to any person of
7787160	7794680	color in this universe, they're going to tell you it's exhausting having to explain and defend
7796200	7803480	themselves, their existence because of other people's willful ignorance, and that they want
7803480	7808360	them to explain it to them rather than this person giving enough of a shit to go out and
7808360	7814360	look for the answer themselves. And that's how I feel about people streaming the game who claim
7814360	7821480	to be an ally and still don't understand when you explain it to them. It's, it's,
7826200	7834760	you know what I mean? I'm just letting you have your space. I'm really trying to be succinct
7834760	7840360	about it. I do not think we should go in and harass other people TLDR, you know, yeah.
7841400	7848600	I think that you can take your friend aside, and you can explain to them and you can give
7848600	7855560	them resources and let them educate themselves. And pay attention to the things that they say
7855560	7863720	about it. Are they repeating what other people have said? Do they have their own reasons for it?
7864360	7875240	Um, are they doing it from a place of hate? You know, I even look at this for a lot of people
7875240	7883640	who claim allyship but are still playing the game that it's, it's like one of those as they
7883720	7889640	quote micro transgressions, that they don't realize the harm that they're doing, and they're not
7889640	7898280	doing it in a spirit of ill will, but they do not understand. And in some cases, there's people who
7898280	7903560	are not capable of understanding that experience. They don't live it. I tried to, I tell my mother
7903560	7909160	regularly, you know, like when I was talking about like, I forgot what I was talking about,
7909160	7912280	but my mom said, well, I've never had that happen. I was like, you are not other people,
7912280	7915240	just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it hasn't happened to other people.
7916040	7923560	Your experiences are yours. Their experiences are theirs. And I think that you have to
7923560	7931800	be willing to be vulnerable. You have to really be willing to be vulnerable and be willing to be
7931800	7941160	wrong in something that you hold as an intrinsic core belief. You have to be willing to be hurt
7941160	7950520	by it, to grow as a person, to be educated and learn why what you're doing has a greater impact
7950520	7956760	than just having fun with a video game. Cause I can guarantee you a few of my, my trans friends
7956760	7963000	that I've spoken to on this one have lost friendships over this game because, and I will
7963000	7971320	paraphrase, my friend is saying your friendship with me to you is not more important than this
7971320	7980600	game. This game is more important to you than I am as a person. So that's my piece for now.
7980600	7983320	I'm going to eat some pizza. No, you're fine. I'm going to be honest. When I originally saw
7983320	7988120	the email, I didn't want to talk about it because I feel like I don't want to give that game any
7988120	7993480	more attention. This game has already gotten way too much attention. This boycott has absolutely
7993480	7999800	positively completely backfired. And if you don't like me for saying that too fucking bad. The proof
7999800	8006760	is in the numbers. It's selling like wild. It's the number one watched game on Twitch. And I would
8006760	8013400	say the boycott has only fanned the flames of that whole thing. Let me be clear. My own viewpoint on
8013400	8018600	Hogwarts legacy. I'm treating it like a sports game. I don't like there, there can be a great
8018600	8023160	video game out there. I don't fucking care to play it. And I don't fucking care to play it because of
8023160	8027560	the shit that's come out of her mouth. And I've been disconnected from this universe for quite
8027560	8033560	some time. I think I've seen a couple of the movies, but like, that's it on the, so, so yeah,
8033560	8038920	I understand why, why people are upset and why, you know, this game and so forth. That being said,
8039000	8044040	I also understand that hurt people hurt people. And I understand why some of this is getting very
8044040	8049000	ugly because like it was said in the, in the email, trans people have had to put up with a
8049000	8055160	lot of bullshit over the years. And so, yeah, when feelings get hurt, sometimes that turns around
8055160	8061960	into hurting other people. But that being said, and I think Jamie really already touched on a lot
8061960	8066200	of this. I'm really just echoing a lot of what you just said. You don't know somebody else's
8066200	8073560	backstory. You don't know what they might be capable of when it comes to separating
8073560	8081320	Harry Potter as a fictional universe from the creator. What I mean by that is when you go in,
8081320	8085480	and I'm not, I'm saying you, but I'm just saying not, not you the listener, but you the bully out
8085480	8089480	there that probably isn't listening. When the bully goes into somebody's chat deciding, I'm
8089480	8095400	going to bully this person for playing this game. Have you ever thought that maybe the person that's
8095400	8101800	playing the game is playing the game because Harry Potter was something that they read to
8103000	8109720	when they were trying to escape an abusive family situation. When mom and dad were fighting in the
8109720	8117240	other room, and there were physical exchanges happening. And somebody went in to lock themselves
8117240	8122280	in their bedroom and read Harry Potter because that was their escape. You don't know if that's
8122280	8132760	somebody else's story. And so the answer is to bully that individual into coming over to your
8132760	8138840	side. I'm sorry, that's absolutely not going to work. You're going to cause them to double down
8138840	8143240	and dig their heels in and you're going to make the problem worse, which is what has happened in
8143240	8150200	this case. And the saying holds true, you catch more more flies with with honey than vinegar.
8150200	8154440	Yeah, and but I'm sick of, you know, the unfortunately, when I see these perspectives
8154440	8159400	presented about we should educate and we should do these different things that is usually met with,
8159400	8163560	well, you're privileged, and you're in a privileged position to be able to do that.
8163560	8168520	But you can also both things can be true. I could recognize, yes, I'm in a privileged position,
8168520	8173400	but I can also recognize but guess what, this tactic you're using over here isn't working,
8173400	8179800	and you're going to be able to win more people to your side if you educate people. And that is what
8179800	8183880	I do. When people say they're going to stream Hogwarts Legacy, I say great, I'm not going to
8183880	8188280	be watching. I have no interest in that game. That woman turned me off to that game several
8188280	8194840	years ago and that entire universe. I have no interest in that franchise. There are 20 other
8194840	8200120	games that came out this month that we ought to be talking about. And we're still talking about this.
8201480	8206040	And the other thing too, you know, we were bringing up privilege and I was bringing up
8206040	8215720	putting the emotional labor on the, quote, afflicted party. We who were in a privileged
8215720	8225960	position to be an ally, who have, you know, at least this semblance of fitting into some
8225960	8233320	accepted stereotype, we can use our privilege and it's encouraged, I think, for us to do so to
8233320	8242600	offer that point more in the way of pointing to resources put out by people in the marginalized
8242600	8250600	groups. For example, and even me as an autistic person, I have submitted many things to my
8250600	8255800	corporate work that's actually had our training changed. Like for an example, they were all like
8255800	8261800	doing that person first, so person with autism, when the majority of us don't go by that. We go
8261800	8268360	by autistic person and find the other thing insulting. And now the material says, ask what
8268360	8278200	someone prefers. But I think that also, as I am not a psychologist, I mean, I have a lot of
8278200	8284600	interest in psychology and I've learned quite a bit about it, but I'm not a psychologist and I
8284600	8290760	can't tell you that this is the true effect of someone's mindset or their neurology or whatnot.
8290760	8297800	Just like, I mean, I spent a lot of time in the sociology courses, but I'm not a sociologist. I
8297800	8304680	don't know how it affects society in this point, for example. You have to know resources that you
8304680	8311320	can direct people to because you cannot expect the person in the group to continue to provide
8311320	8318600	that emotional labor and consistent, I would even say, reopening of wounds by having to speak about
8318600	8326760	it ad nauseam. It's up to us to be a good ally for the groups, the marginalized groups that we
8326760	8334040	do, are not an active part of and provide the material that has been approved, that has been
8334040	8339080	called good. The same way I say, do not refer people to Autism Speaks. They're a hate group.
8340120	8344360	ASAN is a lot better. The same thing, we have to learn those resources from the people that
8344360	8348920	are in the groups to find out what's accepted and what really puts the point across. And we
8348920	8356520	have to make sure that we put this information out there. And be willing to speak up when we see
8356520	8369880	injustice done. Silence is complicity, is exactly how I see it. And indirect participation
8370600	8380680	is also an act of complicity. So I choose not to be complicit in the things that are antithesis
8380680	8387320	to my belief system. And I believe that a transgender woman is a woman. I believe a
8387320	8392520	transgender man is a man. I believe that a non-binary person is legitimately non-binary,
8392520	8397720	no matter what's in their knickers. Yes, I use a very southern word for underwear.
8399880	8409480	I think that people who get their panties all in a bunch over other people just wanting the same
8409480	8418120	rights as other people, honestly enough, I would like to see their roles reversed. I would love,
8418680	8423880	I mean, and it's, you know, literature has tried to do this before. Like, for example,
8423880	8426760	there was an old Superman comic where Lois Lane was black for a day.
8426760	8436440	It's very controversial, but there are some times where I desperately wish that I could take a
8436440	8443800	bigot and have them live a day in the life of one of the people they hate.
8446440	8453640	And see what they're standing against and how ridiculously dangerous it is.
8454600	8460680	I think, for me, too, the thing that is, if I can point my finger at what upsets me most about
8461800	8470040	J. Karen Rowling and her viewpoints. Obviously, I find her viewpoints gross. But what really-
8470040	8471320	Let's just call her Karen.
8471320	8476520	What really sealed it for me was the fact that one of the pro-LGBT
8478280	8482280	agencies, I want to say it was PFLAG, but I might be wrong. It might be a different,
8482840	8488680	GLAAD, it might be a different advocacy organization. They offered to talk to her,
8488680	8495800	sit her down one on one, educate her in a respectful environment and let her know why
8495800	8501160	her words are hurtful. She turned them down. And that's where I have the problem is that
8501160	8506280	somebody who refuses to be educated and refuses to even listen, that's a problem.
8506280	8514040	I kind of go back to some things I said on the show a couple of weeks ago, and that is,
8514040	8516600	I think it was the week you weren't here, Jamie, though, actually. But it was,
8516600	8522040	fuck you, you fucking fuck has never won an argument. Never, ever in the history of ever
8522040	8526280	has that won an argument. I quite frankly, some of this bullying and this stuff that's happening,
8526280	8530200	I find it to be quite performative. I'm just going to say it. It's a performance.
8530840	8535800	It's- I think a lot of it comes from a place where somebody, instead of doing actual hard
8535800	8542760	work to educate, they want to do a performance to show everybody, look, I'm such an ally,
8542760	8550280	I'm going to bully these people into submission. I'm sorry. That's disgusting. Wake up.
8550920	8555560	That reminds me actually of a former mutual friend of both of ours.
8555560	8557880	Yeah, I know. I know. But-
8558760	8560120	But it really is performative.
8560120	8564440	It is. And the part that gets me, and this all comes back to the whole,
8564440	8569480	there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. And I know some people don't want to apply that
8569480	8574680	to this argument. I'm sorry. There's too many people that want to say, oh, well, it's not this
8574680	8581000	because of this. It's not, you know, I'm sorry. You don't get to draw the fucking borders just
8581000	8589880	so that it works for you. And my case and point is the Twitter bullying. What the actual fuck
8590520	8600200	are you doing, you fucking hypocrite? And the excuses I have seen people use. Oh, well,
8600200	8605080	Twitter is a public forum, so it's different and we owe it to ourselves to be here to-
8606520	8615160	What? Twitter is not a public forum. It is not a publicly traded company. It is a private forum
8615160	8621880	owned by one person who wants it to be the town square. But I ask you, do his actions
8622520	8626520	that shove his tweets in your face, whether you want to or not, unless you blocked his ass,
8627320	8633240	is that representative of what the town square ought to look like? By the way, a same individual
8633240	8640440	who wrote a tweet that said, and I quote, my pronouns are prosecute slash Fauci. You will
8640440	8646680	turn a blind eye to that, to use that person's platform that generates those ad dollars to yell
8646680	8652440	at your streamer that is streaming Hogwarts legacy. Now, again, I don't want to make it
8652440	8658440	sound like this whole like, no, it is you who are the bully and this whole thing. I'm not saying
8658440	8662040	that I love the fact that this game is getting all this attention and that, you know, people
8662040	8667800	are streaming it. Again, I'm not going to watch it, but at the same time, you using Twitter to
8667800	8676520	yell at those people like that makes you look like a stupid ass. And meanwhile, folks, guess
8676520	8682920	what else is happening in the world? Drag queen, anti-drag queen library reading laws are being
8682920	8689240	passed. Anti-trans bills are being passed. Did you know there's another bill that's going on?
8689240	8694200	I want to say it's like Tennessee, Kentucky, probably both, honestly, that is trying to mirror
8694200	8699400	what's going on in Florida. No, it's Indiana is the one that mirrors Florida. While you're all
8699400	8705720	arguing about, is it ethical to play a video game on my Nintendo Switch when Nintendo is 8%
8706280	8712360	owned by a Saudi company now that, by the way, we know how, you know, that culture feels about
8712360	8722120	LGBT rights. While we argue those ethics, actual fucking anti-laws are being passed. And what have
8722200	8732600	you done from your Twitter account to stop this from happening? Nothing. You are useless with this
8732600	8740680	bullying. Stop it. And even on top of that, like, I agree that for people who can't get out and do
8740680	8746440	something, then helping to disseminate correct information via social media is perfectly valid.
8747000	8753240	But to do nothing but rant without putting forward any sort of factual
8754280	8761080	evidence. I mean, it's inherently a fallacious argument. You're just being an ass, like you said.
8763160	8769240	And I think that all of us who profess our allyship need to do something. I mean,
8769240	8773080	everything is going to have a degree of performance to it. That's just how our world is,
8773880	8781640	even for the people who are just flat out saying, we're not, you know, I'm not going to play this
8781640	8787640	game and put it out publicly. You know, that's a little performative. I'll grant it. And I think
8787640	8794280	in some cases there is a benefit to certain performative actions because it will bring
8794280	8799720	attention to the thought or make someone who would otherwise have not seen that point of view look at
8799720	8811480	it. But you have to back up the optics with the true action that goes behind it. You know, for
8811480	8819000	example, if you are, say, say that you don't have money to donate and you are physically incapable
8819000	8829240	of going out and protesting, you can write a letter. You know, you can highlight charities,
8829720	8836520	you know, for, you know, like me, I can't donate to every charity that I want to as much as I want
8836520	8844360	to. But as a streamer, I can run a charity. You can uplift trans and non-binary streamers
8844360	8849960	because guess what? When you go to hate watch another streamer that's playing Hogwarts Legacy,
8850600	8855880	you're still watching and you're helping them to meet their partner metrics and you're helping to
8855880	8863800	meet their affiliate metrics. You really are. You're part of the problem. So why don't you take
8863800	8871640	your view and give it to somebody else more deserving? Every action is going to have an
8871640	8877880	effect no matter what. I mean, think of like that butterfly effect thing, if you will. You know,
8877880	8885240	any little thing that you do is going to have an outcome. You deciding to take a breath could
8885240	8892200	result in maybe a coughing fit because you're like me and you're still congested or it's the
8892200	8898360	breath you need to take before darting away from someone trying to kill you. You know, it's all
8898360	8904920	situational. And I think that you need to really look at the big picture. You need to think of how
8905880	8912600	this action that I am doing right now, what is it going to cascade into? Because honestly,
8912600	8916120	now the game getting all of this attention is because people did not think about what the
8916120	8926440	fuck you were doing. Think before you act and do not react. Act. There is a difference between
8926440	8937240	acting and reacting. Do not let another stimulus determine what you are going to do without looking
8937240	8941800	at all sides of the thing. That's why I guess so. Honestly, that's partly why I left Facebook
8942360	8948600	because it's such a fucking echo chamber and you need to be willing also to step outside of the
8948600	8956200	damn echo chamber and look at another point of view. Fuck. If you are a diehard socialist like
8956200	8961560	me, read Fox News, see what the other side is saying. Read the conservative media, see what
8961560	8969400	the other side is saying. Look objectively at your own beliefs. Be critical of them. Be critical
8969400	8975560	of what they're doing because you are not going to grow without challenge. And all of these people
8975560	8981400	out there who are going and yelling at people, you know, that that's not challenging the other
8981400	8985960	person. That's going to lock them down. And you certainly are not challenging yourself to be
8985960	8995400	better. You are not an ally by performing this action. All right. Well, a lot of folks in chat
8995400	9003160	are being thankful for the discussion tonight. So I'm I'm I'm glad we had it. I guess even though
9003160	9007640	I didn't really want to in the beginning, I feel like, OK, we've we've had the therapy,
9007640	9015400	we've aired it out. But let me be very clear. This all being said, fuck this game. I'm over it.
9015400	9018280	I don't ever want to talk about this game again. There are-
9018280	9020440	Fuck the game, fuck her, fuck everybody.
9020440	9025560	There are many other things that are worthy of your attention. By the way, I just want to point
9025560	9031480	out the trans witches are witches bundle on itch.io is only about $11,000 short of its goal.
9032520	9040520	And I'm not sure when the deadline is. Oh, till the 24th. So you only have about five more days.
9040520	9048200	So if you want to maybe these are 69 nice games, I'd rather be talking about right now.
9048760	9056120	I would rather talk about literally any one of these games than the one that won't go away.
9056840	9062840	I like what you said. And by the way, real quick in our text message earlier, because I mean,
9062840	9066600	I think I might have surprised you by saying I thought that it was really thoughtful email
9066600	9069560	would provoke a good discussion. So I say we do it. And you said, all right.
9070200	9071960	I know. I was like, yeah.
9072920	9077960	But, um, but I like what you said that you treated as a Madden game. You're not interested.
9077960	9079800	And it's because of her words.
9079800	9086040	That's right. That that is what it is to me. The Madden games, they sell a ton. Some people find
9086040	9093880	them to be great games. Cool. I'm still not interested. And that's at least the thing is,
9093880	9100280	I mean, I could come up with other problems about the NFL. But I just maybe it's a different type
9100280	9105080	of thing. I'm just not interested in sports at the end of the day. Whereas, you know, in this one,
9105080	9110440	it's her viewpoints have tarnished the pool or whatever you want to, you know, shit the bed,
9110440	9115080	whatever analogy you want to use. But it's it's like the same thing. That's how I view it as a
9115080	9121000	video game. I just I, there's other games to play. There are lots and lots of other games to play.
9121320	9126440	And and I think that as you and I discussed a little bit earlier, you saw where I was coming
9126440	9132280	from with needing to discuss it. And I'm really glad that we did because we have been quiet on it.
9132280	9139960	But I feel honestly enough that as I mean, at least you and I being under the quilt bag, you
9139960	9147800	know, and being and all of us being allies to our trans friends, we we have almost a responsibility
9147800	9155080	to at least say something about it. And I'm glad that we did this. Garth, I absolutely appreciate
9155080	9163080	your email. You are the MVP of this of this month. And I'm glad that we got it out. I actually feel
9163080	9170120	better for getting this out. And I don't mind going back to not drawing any more attention to
9170120	9179160	it. But I do think that as as allies, and as you know, part of the quilt bag, that we have
9179160	9186680	a responsibility to say something, and I'm glad we did. And if nothing else, let the the failure
9186680	9191640	of this boycott campaign be a lesson, because there's going to be other video games in the
9191640	9198120	future that you're going to have some opinions about. And your actions may actually have the
9198120	9203560	opposite effect of what you're aiming for. Just just act and don't react.
9205080	9211320	Think ahead, educate around corners. Educate. If somebody doesn't want to be educated,
9211320	9214600	then that tells you all you need to know about your relationship with that person.
9215880	9220680	But definitely learned how to look around the corner. anticipate and act accordingly.
9222120	9226200	All right. Can you believe there's no one waiting to call in tonight?
9227080	9228840	I want to talk to people now.
9228840	9230040	Loki, are you alive?
9231000	9231800	I'm here.
9231800	9236120	I'm gonna be late playing my dead by daylight, but this is worth it. I want people to call in.
9236120	9241560	Call in because I said no, no, I I'm gonna actually say if nobody is waiting at this point,
9241560	9245640	we're 15 minutes till nine o'clock in the night on the East Coast. I would like to go ahead and move
9245640	9250840	to start to wrap up tonight. But if you do have an email for a future week, participate at orange
9250840	9255480	laundry.com is a great place to send it. I do want to check in real quick with Loki as well and see
9255480	9259560	if there's any final thoughts or not final thoughts. I'm sorry, final last minute stories.
9259560	9260680	I have one too.
9260680	9269160	There wasn't too much. It was basically that the preorder bonus art book for was it Zelda,
9269160	9273640	Tears of the Kingdom has leaked out early. So people are going to look at some of the artwork
9273640	9277560	and stuff from the game that hasn't been shown yet. I don't really know what spoiler is it
9277560	9281880	necessarily is. It doesn't really have everything. But yeah, looks like Zelda.
9282840	9287320	So although Toon Link is in there, so I guess that's somewhat of a spoiler. I don't really
9287320	9292360	know what purpose that serves. But they have an image of Toon Link with the arm thing just like
9293400	9295320	Link has in Tears of the Kingdom. So
9296120	9299080	could be something with the amiibo, but I wouldn't read too much into it.
9299800	9303160	It also just be like promo stuff or concept art.
9303160	9304520	Yeah, maybe. Yeah.
9306680	9307240	Yeah, please.
9308200	9315880	Um, Insight Editions announced that they are publishing an Amy Rose fortune telling card set
9317720	9322280	based on the ones that were seen in Sonic Origins and also from the IDW
9322920	9331080	comic series. And they're going to be available in October
9334360	9339880	from Barnes and Noble and other online things and it'll be 25 bucks.
9340680	9346840	The cards are really freaking pretty. Like, really well done. There's like chaos fruit
9346840	9350760	and chaos emeralds and all kinds of stuff. It looks beautiful.
9352520	9356600	So I just I just looked at chat. I know I usually don't mention these till after the show. But since
9356600	9360440	we're wrapping down here, I noticed during that last discussion, y'all got us to a level three
9360440	9364520	hype train. That's um, that's really incredible. Thank you so much. Thanks for being a cool
9364520	9367800	community. I mean, y'all been really cool and chat with your comments and everything.
9368680	9373640	So it's it's a nice refreshing change of pace from sometimes what I see on the rest.
9373640	9374280	Hey, guess what?
9375080	9375960	The internet. What's that?
9377640	9380680	Oh, we've already finished. I tried to bump us to level four.
9381160	9389800	Don't. Oh, well. That's all right. Um, okay. With that, let's wrap up. It's been it's been a good
9389800	9394600	show tonight. But it's gonna have to last you for two weeks. We will not be here next week. Don't
9394600	9403160	forget. And that's all my fault. And I am not sorry about it. But Jamie will still be streaming
9403160	9408440	our pal Bobby Blackwell will be here with his usual show at eight o'clock Eastern five o'clock
9408440	9413320	Pacific here at bog network. So you have plenty to watch just you know, just a week off otherwise.
9414040	9417560	Those of you that have a three day weekend this weekend, I hope you have a nice long weekend.
9417560	9421880	And plus, this is one of those weekends where I don't have to be like, remember why the holiday
9421880	9427640	exists like it's President's Day. All right, cool sales, you know, like, it's, it's, it's whatever.
9427640	9432920	So um, yeah, that's that's gonna do it for this week of orange was radio. If you enjoyed what
9432920	9437560	you heard here, if you want to join our awesome community, please do we're here live on Sunday
9437560	9441480	nights over at vog network. But of course, you can join us on Discord chat throughout the week,
9441480	9447160	we still have our podcast family as well. Always you can email us, you could tweet us at OLR.
9447160	9451880	Although I think I've made my issues with Twitter clear, but I'm trying I'm lazily keeping an eye on
9451880	9460040	it. Not like I used to though, let me say that. And yeah, all that stuff. So tell a friend or
9460040	9463160	two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every giver has a voice.
9463240	9467960	But we need more voices here to put out on air a nice five star review on a site wherever you
9467960	9474120	found this show, whether it was iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, podcasts, whatever it was, hit that five
9474120	9481080	star button. If it has a review option, say they're cool. And leave a nice review. That
9481080	9486040	would be great. With that, let's get to final thoughts. Dark Sakura, you're going to do all
9486040	9492200	this and stream. So give us your final thought tonight. I'm I haven't decided if I'm going to
9492200	9497480	do a killer only or play some survivor. So if anyone wants to Swift with me, you know where my
9497480	9504120	chat is. All right. Have a good night, Jamie. We'll see you next two weeks. See you then.
9505080	9508760	I won't. All right, Loki, your final thought for tonight.
9509800	9517960	My final thought is that I need to work faster at my Minecraft stuff. I think you're onto something
9517960	9524440	with maybe taking on smaller builds. I know you know, big projects. You're like my first game is
9524440	9529560	going to be pixel poops number two. I'm not going to build a clone of solitaire. I'm going to just
9529560	9535400	end. But hey, you know what? You get it done one way or the other because you got that pixel poops
9535400	9542520	games done and which just celebrated a year if I'm not mistaken. And two years. Oh, how appropriate
9542520	9548680	number two. And of course, your YouTubes are great. And people will people have got to find
9548680	9555080	them eventually. So here's hoping. My final thought, I'll be streaming more theater than
9555080	9560280	this week, probably not tonight, but tomorrow, Monday, and then probably a little bit Tuesday,
9560280	9565560	a little bit Wednesday. And then I'll be on streaming vacation for a week. And then by the
9565560	9570440	time I get back, God, we're almost going to be into the Diablo four beta, which we didn't even
9570440	9575320	talk about tonight, but the open beta is going to be happening there, and so forth. So there's,
9575320	9579240	there's just a lot of stuff like I was looking at the stuff I want to stream this year. There is so
9579960	9587160	much but yeah, streaming is is up and up. It's fun. Thank you for being here with us tonight as
9587160	9592600	we're doing streaming and streaming this show. I hope you all have a great week. If nothing else
9592600	9601640	from tonight's discussion, like treat each other with some decency. Educate. I don't know what else
9601640	9604680	to say here at the end of the show. We hope to educate you a little more in two more weeks on
9604680	9607800	what's going on in the gaming industry. Have a wonderful night, everybody. Take care of each
9607800	9616200	other. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is a production of
