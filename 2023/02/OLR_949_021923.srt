1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
I love Theorhythm. It's easily among the best spin-offs of a decades-long series that

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,280
accentuates one of the consistently best things to come from it. However, I miss Theorhythm

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,640
Dragon Quest, predominantly because it only came out in Japan. Reportedly, the final Barline

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,000
team wants to branch out beyond Final Fantasy and Square Enix properties. Two sore thumbs

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,880
way up. Yes, please. This is the BMS FMS OMG LOL update. Now it's time for your hosts Rob

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,600
Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,800
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,760
number 949 of our show for tonight, February 19, 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,080
with you every week with my pals to talk about the latest and greatest in video gaming and get

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,960
your input as we tape live because we want to hear your thoughts too. But in the meantime, you

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,400
get my thoughts and you get the thoughts of DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers. Hello. Hello. How

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,000
are you doing?

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,720
I feel better than I sound.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,440
I was gonna I was gonna kind of get a check in because I know you know you were out two weeks

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,320
ago that you're like still recovering last week. So mostly on the mend at this point you feel

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,120
better than you sound.

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,760
Yeah, I mean, my throat's still pretty bad. I honestly think that my bout with COVID kind of

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:47,160
undid some of the the good that had gone from my my week saw from work. So I emailed my doctor

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,280
because I'm pretty sure I have a sinus infection now.

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,200
Oh, gosh.

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,120
Well, you know, I get them like at the drop of a hat. So it's not like it's just the cough

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:04,320
afterward I've already taken. I always forget like their their brand name, like Tesla line pearls or

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,640
something. It sounds like something from a sci fi show. I know it has been donated. It's really

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,000
good cough suppressant. I mean, well, I have to get a prescription and then there's this crap.

27
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,120
Well, for gosh sakes be healed.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,080
Lido cane.

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,440
Yeah, it's Dennis numbing solution there.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,720
It's not delicious. It's but it feels really good when you've like gotten past the initial

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,360
nastiness, especially if you drink something cold with it. It's like extra numb.

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,000
All right, well, I mean, hopefully the upside to being sick is that you've had a lot of time to

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,880
play games, but we'll check in in just a little bit. In the meantime, let's say hello as well to

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,240
Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,640
Hey, how's it going?

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,480
I am doing good. How's your week been?

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,640
It's been all right. Yeah. Busy, busy. Yeah.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,880
So we do tape live of course, at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice of geeks network every

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,640
if you care to join us live, you can see our lovely faces as we're chatting doing this show and

41
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,800
sometimes there's visual flair going on. For example, Loki likes to have, you know, different

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,760
video games that are playing behind him while he's chatting and tonight I it looks like some

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,200
version of theme park or is that is that the new the newer one rollercoaster? Planet Coaster? Yeah,

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,560
okay. Yeah, it's that one. I'm sorry, but every time I see one of those theme park games, I always

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,160
think of that video I saw somewhere of rollercoaster tycoon or something where like the the

46
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,120
Rihanna song is playing and it's all happy. And then the coaster goes off the rails and everybody

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,520
dies and it turns to Adele and I don't know why it's the funniest fucking video, but it is. So

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,960
anyway, it's a lot funnier than I just described it. I promise look it up on YouTube. I don't even

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,520
know what it's called. But Tiger Claw will still find it I'm sure so. But why Planet Coaster? Is

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
that a game that you've been into lately? Or you just been thinking about?

51
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,760
No, I just I saw a video earlier this week of one of the streamers I watch, Doug Doug,

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:23,040
and he did a thing where he was trying to survive in Planet Coaster for one hour. But every five

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,480
minutes of random like he had this giant wheel they'd spend there'd be a random kind of handicap

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,560
in the game. So like whether you had to like spend half your money on benches or like move the

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,800
coaster to the farthest end of the park and like ridiculous stuff like that. And so it was it was

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,400
just like that video is pretty funny. So it reminded me of that as like, you know, I should

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,040
probably play that game since I have it and I not played it but I probably should play it looks fun.

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,080
Apparently SSJ 100 Matt won the YouTube fight there because there it is. Apparently that's it.

59
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,760
I can't bring it up because I don't want to get the station DMCA'd with the copyright music,

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,920
but I'm just assuming it's right. So good job, Matt. Awesome. All right.

61
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,000
I've seen that video without the music before.

62
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,040
The music makes it that much better. It really does. All right. Sorry to the podcast listeners.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,760
Ask on Discord. We'll post the link at our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord,

64
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,800
where you can join and chat with us throughout the week or throughout the next two weeks. I know I've

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,200
been saying this, you know, broken record the last month. But for those that, you know, maybe don't

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,920
check in every week and what have you, I will not be here next week. Alan and I are going on a

67
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,160
well-deserved vacation. I'm just gonna say it. We earned it and we're going on vacation. And we did

68
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,200
this in 2020 right in the before times we went on the Star Trek cruise. So we are going again this

69
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,200
year. We skipped, they actually did a cruise last year. But between the home buying and we still

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,880
weren't quite comfortable with where COVID was at in the world at that point. So we didn't go

71
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,720
last year. But this year, it's kind of one of those. Well, that thing can get me anywhere. So

72
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm just saying screw it and going on the cruise and I think we'll have a good time. So excited

73
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,520
about that. So but I won't be here. So I'm not here to push buttons. So are you streaming next

74
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,000
week Dark Soccer? Are you gonna like just take a week off yourself? Yeah. Awesome. So then check

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,400
out Dark Soccer. No, I have a week to make up for. So come hell or high water, you know, I'll

76
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,280
hire a voiceover artist if I have to have someone speak for me, but I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna

77
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,840
start at our time too. You know, with the modern, you know, technology that is AI generated voices,

78
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,360
you could actually just copy your voice with about a minute worth of clips. I've played with that,

79
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,080
and it's fun. You could do it. It sounds weird to myself, but like it's, I'd say it's like 80%

80
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,760
convincing. Link me the thing because I actually what I want to do is use that for Midna in my

81
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,240
videos. Yeah, that could be fun. Get that individual with their absolute chaotic energy

82
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
that plays Dead by Daylight Swift with you on stream and get them to just narrate your stream.

83
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,280
Yeah. Shayla would totally do it. Just have Shayla narrate your stream. But honestly,

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,440
when Shayla's in there, I don't really have to talk because all of them through the background

85
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:34,320
you hear, I love you. I love you. Yay, babe onomori. Yay, RPG. I love Shayla. I'm gonna go

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,560
boop the killer. I'm gonna go boop the killer. Love me. Love me. Love me. It's really funny.

87
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,920
Did I tell you about the trickster that we totally confused the other last week?

88
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,360
Here we go. I've derailed with Dead by Daylight talk. All right. Make it quick.

89
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
We've got news to get into. Okay. It's by daylight derailed by daylight.

90
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,960
But like, I was, I was just gonna play straight. We were in the airy and I was working on where

91
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,320
the no, no, no. Never play straight. Always play gay. Rob. All right. I was going to play

92
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:12,480
standard. I was going to play a normal game. Got her. And next thing I know, here comes Shayla

93
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,960
being chased by the trickster and then like doing the little, you know, bop thing in, in front of

94
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,760
him and then pointing. And I was like, Oh hell. So I just came over and did the same thing too.

95
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,160
And he just like followed us around for half the match before he decided to start playing seriously.

96
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,040
And then afterwards he comes in my chat and it's like, I'm so confused.

97
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,720
So we, we explained that, that Shayla is the killer whisperer.

98
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,520
And, and I, I said, yeah, we killer mains know our own. I'm a dirty pig main.

99
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
All right. All right. So it was pretty funny though.

100
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
Derailed by Daylight. Just another segment here on Orange Launch Radio. I love that name.

101
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,760
That's right. Yep. We need to, can somebody arrange that on the Wiki? A Derailed by Daylight

102
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,280
page. All right. And when it was Mass Effect, was it Mass Derailment?

103
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
Something like that. I think it was Mass Effect at some point.

104
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,760
All right. Moving on. Let's talk about other video games that are in the news this week.

105
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,160
And Metroid Prime, the remaster is in the news. But this particular reason, maybe not a great

106
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,840
one, but let's talk about maybe the standard this game is calling attention to. I don't think this

107
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,880
is the first game where this has happened, but let's talk about it. Loki, you want to get into

108
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,520
this for us? It's not the first game that's happened. I'm not sure why we can't just include,

109
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:46,320
you know, credits for the people that make games, but apparently Metroid Prime remastered does not

110
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,240
include the full original game credits. So that everybody that worked on the original game

111
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,680
is not credited in it. All you get instead is a single card that says based on the work of

112
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,760
Metroid Prime, original Nintendo GameCube and Wii version development staff. Like,

113
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,680
it doesn't cost anything to put credits in the game unless they have like some sort of contract

114
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,920
with your name appears in this, then you get money somehow or something like that, which

115
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,200
I mean, they probably should be owed some money at the very least. But I don't understand why

116
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,840
it would be so hard to put current credits for somebody that worked on the game originally. Like

117
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,920
that's what they do when they adapt things and stuff like that. I've seen other remasters that

118
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,040
they put the credits in there. But this isn't like the first time that they've done this.

119
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,600
I remember, I'm trying to remember which game it was now. But I know we had something like that

120
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,000
where it was, you know, the original creator of it wasn't credited before. It wasn't that long

121
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,600
ago either. But I don't know, it is kind of annoying. Let me ask a difficult question, though.

122
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,640
If this individual who tweeted about it, who I'm assuming was one of the individuals who worked on

123
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,040
the original game, if this person hadn't called it out, would anyone have noticed?

124
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,320
Like, how many people are actually watching video game credits? And please don't say yes,

125
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,040
just because you want to be different out there. Like, I just think there's a lot of people,

126
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,840
and I'm not, you know, please don't misunderstand me. I do think, you know, the people that did work

127
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,640
on the game deserve to be acknowledged and so forth. I'm just kind of curious if anyone would

128
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,240
have really noticed if it hadn't been pointed out on social media, because I don't think a lot of

129
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
people watch video game credits, or they might play a mini game during the credits or something

130
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,240
like that. And I understand like the, I understand the point, like, if this is a game that's

131
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,680
completely rebuilt from the ground up, and using some of the assets, and even kind of rebuilt the

132
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,200
assets too. So like, I get it, like, it's weird, you know, crediting the original team when you've

133
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,600
basically taken none of their work and just redid it. But I mean, there's still story and other

134
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
elements and stuff like that. I still think that they should be credited, like at the very least,

135
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,160
you know, original game, you know, something brief, like, you know, just listening to team

136
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
members or something like that, you don't have to go into detail, like this person did, like,

137
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,000
you know, artwork in the original games, like when that's not necessarily represented in the

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,560
full game. I still think it is kind of a little bit of like, kind of a, I don't know, but it's

139
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,480
not nice. It's not nice. But to that, like, I don't think it's necessarily the team that did

140
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,600
the remasters job to put that information in there. Also, they may have not had that information

141
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
to begin with, like, they may not know who worked on the original game.

142
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,320
Well, right. But like, are you going to watch everything and, you know,

143
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,200
transcribe everything like that's not something. Yeah, you could, but that should be provided by

144
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,560
Nintendo, Nintendo should say, Hey, you know, we want to make sure or they could have reached out

145
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,280
and said, Hey, we want to put the, you know, we want to credit the people that originally worked

146
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,120
on this game. Can we get a list of the credits from the previous game? I don't know. I don't

147
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,680
know what goes on behind the scenes. But yeah, I think it is kind of get their name in there,

148
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,960
even if they lower the font size or do it like what I mean. But this is what credits turn into

149
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,880
sometimes is I think about when they show a movie on TV. And then like, instead of letting the

150
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,680
credits roll, they reduce the credits to like a quarter of the size of the screen while they're

151
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,200
showing the preview for the next movie. And then this credits are just flying by like they turn up

152
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,720
the credits like 10 speed, which is or they flash along the bottom like there's different ways that

153
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,600
they do it. And I think that's I think that's for union related reasons and kind of the point I

154
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,800
wanted to get to. I think those credits have to be shown for like union related reasons. The TV

155
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,120
station just can't cut them out as part of the rights for airing the movie. I wonder if video

156
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,720
game industry is headed for unionization as we've talked about many, you know, past months on this

157
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,080
show. I wonder if we shouldn't see something in there about video game credits in these types of

158
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,040
cases and when they should be kept in the game. I think it would be interesting to see what comes

159
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,520
to that. Whether it ends up being credits on fast forward or what? I mean, this has always been an

160
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,760
issue in the industry. I mean, do we do we not remember adventure or was it adventure? Yeah.

161
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,400
Or the Atari of that era was infamous for not crediting their designers, which is why a lot of

162
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,520
the talented folks went over to Activision, where you could play David Crane's Pitfall,

163
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,240
like his name was right there in the, you know, title of the game. Yeah, that was, you know,

164
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,200
it's interesting to think about Activision today and all of their problems. But actually, in the

165
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,240
80s, Activision was kind of seen as the one that was more progressive when it came to the rights

166
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,760
of the game makers by crediting them in the games and they lured talent that way was huge deal. And

167
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,720
then yes, one of the earliest Easter eggs and adventure like you brought up the initials of the

168
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,800
game's creators. That was that was put in there as kind of an F you to the whole lack of credits

169
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,720
thing. So we can't do that because they would be they caught wind of anything like that. Okay,

170
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,160
we're gonna patch that out, you know? Yeah. So, yeah, we can do and but also remember back in

171
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:28,480
those days, one person often made those entire games, you know, et yards revenge were both made

172
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,680
by one person is actually the same person infamously the best and the worst 2600 game,

173
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,080
although I actually don't think et is the worst 2600 game, because there's a good game in there

174
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,000
somewhere. Whereas there's other games on the Atari 2600. But there is no good game in there

175
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
whatsoever. But I digress. I'm going in the chat over twitch.tv slash vog network some folks

176
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,040
answering the question about do you actually look at the chat. Fifth dream in chat says I know

177
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,480
people who named Pokemon who haven't been in the credits since then. Dr. Tia says I heard this was

178
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,240
also an issue with the Pac Man World remaster. Fifth dream says I let them roll. I don't read

179
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
every credit. Bobby Black Wolf says depends on how good the music is that's playing behind the

180
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,840
credits. Or if my name is in the credits as a backer. I think we all enjoy a good little

181
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,960
mini game in the credits like Smash Brothers comes to mind. I think there's quite a few shooter games

182
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,560
out there too that have like shooting mini games in the credits and things that didn't katamari

183
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,960
damasi have like a roll up the credits thing or am I making that out? Okay. Oh, no, it did. Yeah.

184
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,520
So there's that. Bobby Black Wolf says if you worked on the game three years ago and left the

185
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,760
company, they don't put your name in the credit. To be fair, some modern games only credit the

186
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,720
people who are with the company when the game is released. Interesting perspective. And then some

187
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,040
other folks bringing up other games that have like credit mini games that help you to get paid

188
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,840
attention. As Joe and Hunter Matt says credits are a voluntary experience for the most part in

189
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,040
gaming. I kind of feel why not just include them if the credits are too long folks can skip them

190
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,200
or not just watch them just seems odd. Well, I always I mean, maybe I'm wrong. But I you know,

191
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,960
Marvel movies are infamous for their post credit scenes and their mid credit scenes and all of

192
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,080
this. And why do they do that? I think in part it's to get people to stay through the credits.

193
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,920
Because pretty much any time you go to see a movie, people get up and leave during the

194
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,720
credits. Although now Marvel has conditioned us all to be afraid to do that. I remember

195
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
literally sitting there during Megan and I was like, do we do we need to sit here in case there's

196
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,920
something after the credits. And we quickly googled Megan after credits. And we saw Okay,

197
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,720
no, there's no after credit scene we can go. But it's just it's interesting how that but then you

198
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,680
think think back to the early movies, the early days of movies. credits used to be in the beginning

199
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,760
of the movie. Most relevant example I can think of would be like Rocky Horror Picture Show,

200
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,040
you know, I've seen that movie a lot. And think about that whole opening song with the lips. It's

201
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,800
the opening credits. Now it's not an exhaustive list of credits as they often weren't in that day,

202
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,920
but you get a lot of big credits at the top. This is kind of interesting. So Bobby Lockwolf says

203
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,080
most of the people in the Ant Man screening I was at last night left after the midpoint. Well,

204
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,400
that's on them. I tell you, that's fine. You really only miss a preview of Loki season two

205
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,720
anyway. So it's no big deal. Let's see Fit Dream says I never left because I remember some end

206
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,720
credit scenes as early as the 80s. Dark to see says good. We didn't miss anything. That must be

207
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,280
a reference to Megan. That's really funny. So um, so yeah, I don't know that the credit issue is

208
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,040
interesting. But I think, oh, yeah, Bobby Black will bring it up an 80s movie that had that

209
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,760
Ferris Bueller asking Why are you still here? Remember that after the credits? Go home. Yeah,

210
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,560
it's good, good stuff. But it I think this is gonna be a very interesting issue, especially as

211
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,040
we start looking at like the furthering of unions and games like how this credit issue and even to

212
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Bobby's point, what happens to those folks that they worked on the game, but they left the

213
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,880
company? How do they get credited? I think there's going to be some interesting stuff to come with

214
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
this. But also what I would say to the developers out there is put mini games in your credits and

215
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,040
put post credit scenes in there. So if you if you really want people to watch them, but also

216
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:26,960
some credit scenes are really, really long, like Final Fantasy 14's credits are a lot, especially

217
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,600
I would I would actually encourage you not to watch the realm reborn credits because I believe

218
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,080
they credited all of the 1.0 players that met certain criteria are like actually in the credits

219
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,400
of realm reborn or the early version of it. I think my favorite credits that they've had was

220
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,400
the Lego Movie Two. They made a song about the credits that now that's clever. I like that. And

221
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,800
that was funny. It was great. I like the little mid credit and post credit sequences. I think

222
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,160
that's enough to get people to stick around and like every every RPG at this point has a lot of

223
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,760
those. So you know, it's good. Fifth Dream points out the Weird Al movie has a good end credit song.

224
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,320
All right. Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of good stuff out there. But as far as this game is

225
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,880
concerned, it's it's really a shame what happened to the folks. But also I would kind of ask like

226
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,160
how many people are actually watching these credits. I think we need to maybe have an online

227
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,520
resource as well. Make sure that these folks are credited on the video game version of the internet

228
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,880
movie database and that sort of thing, you know, make sure that they have the credits,

229
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,400
so that when people are looking up their names to see what they worked on for industry stuff,

230
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,840
you can kind of see like what they what they've done fully, I think is a good thing to have out

231
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
there too, because that's really what credits are for, right? If your game wins an award,

232
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,320
you want to be able to tout that award. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming

233
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,720
weeks, whether we rolled credits or not, the types of video games that we have been playing

234
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,680
this week. So Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

235
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,880
I played Star Ocean last night on my stream. And I had to do a lot of backtracking. But

236
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,400
I'm really having a good time with it. The game is absolutely gorgeous. And the sprites are huge.

237
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:25,200
And it's got all the extra audio in it. It's such a good game. And then I was what else I do.

238
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,680
I played of course Dead by Daylight, but I only played like one night because it's funny. Okay,

239
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:40,560
so I've been in training at work to get myself back into the general scheme of things. And I

240
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:48,560
had to be up at 5am or 5.30am like that to be at work by seven. And well, the night before that,

241
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,800
because you remember I was just getting over COVID. I went to bed that Monday at like 2am,

242
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,720
or technically Tuesday morning and woke up at 5pm at the time I normally stream.

243
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,080
Needless to say, I didn't play Dead by Daylight that night and I didn't stream. So I'm

244
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,880
uh, I am going, I'm also, I did play A Little Among Us. I love that game. It's pretty fun.

245
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm playing my wordscapes. I'm super addicted. And I've honestly gotten to where I can beat

246
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,960
some of the harder levels in like 15 seconds. Because I'm a word nerd.

247
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,600
Um, and then we watched a couple of documentaries. One was on the

248
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,000
entire history of Samus Aran. And the other one was on the history of the Star Fox series.

249
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,600
Which actually makes me really disappointed that Star Fox Zero wasn't a better game.

250
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,920
Because it was beautiful. That's it. Oh, one more thing. One more thing.

251
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,240
Okay, we have we have the Beatlemania Pinball Table by Stern.

252
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,200
Oh, yeah. Didn't you mention last week you traded for it?

253
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,040
We did. And I actually finally played it. And it goes sometimes from being a complete

254
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,400
proper gentleman to being a right arsehole.

255
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,680
Love it. By the way, a fashion comment from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network,

256
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,120
Garth the Wolf in chat saying Jamie, I love that your hair matches your glasses.

257
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,400
And for the those in the podcast feed they do and the lipstick I think matches to the darker color

258
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,160
of the glasses a little bit more purpley. The color is called hold on I have it with me.

259
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,360
Orchis by color pop. And for those looking, it is very dark.

260
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Bobby wants to know what you traded for Beatlemania.

261
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,320
Well, it was a temporary trade. We traded Indianapolis.

262
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,220
Hmm.

263
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Um, so no, we traded racing for for classic early rock.

264
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:03,120
But I love that table so much those Beatles your local community that like Dan participates in

265
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,800
they trade tables for like the sake of just having different stuff in and out of the house.

266
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,280
Yeah, let's say Yeah, trading Nintendo cartridges. Exactly. It's not always a value based trade

267
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,440
necessarily. Like, you just kind of all know each other and you know, you're all good for it.

268
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:17,940
Basically.

269
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,520
Yeah, and I mean, it's, it's not like we haven't done permatrades before for equal value.

270
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,080
You know, it's just that, you know, everybody in the community loves their tables and we know

271
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,360
everybody else loves their tables. And so like, there's even like trade work that goes on from

272
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,880
time to time too. But, but at this point, you know, we, the people that we will trade with

273
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,200
know that we will take care of their babies. Yeah. And it's a good way to experience a table

274
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,520
you might not have otherwise experienced. Yeah. Good call. All right. I can't wait to get where

275
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,280
now. Oh. All right. Well, let's move on and talk to Loki about his gaming week. How was your gaming

276
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:11,840
week? Loki is just Minecraft again. I mean, as as his tradition, I was mostly playing my modded

277
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,080
version. So the monsters of mechanics stuff, I'm just trying to set up my next build. So I

278
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,680
finished designing it finally this week. And I've been gathering materials and, and figuring out

279
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,920
different mod conflicts, because we had a problem with a mod they had added in where now I couldn't

280
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:37,200
claim ladders, for some reason. And it's a really weird mod to cause that problem, but it did. So I

281
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,000
figured it out and took it out. But yeah, it's been it's been a lot of fun. I've been having

282
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,720
some fun with it. I'm still disappointed that it's taken me so long to get an episode out

283
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,560
under that series right now. And then I know going into like, the actual S&P stuff for channel 64.

284
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,760
That's gonna take a while to because what I need to design next is a, I think it's I think I'm

285
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,680
doing too much is what I think I'm doing. Because I look at like, for example, hermit craft and like

286
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:16,560
mumbo jumbo is the guy that just came back off of like an eight month hiatus. And he like,

287
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:23,680
literally worked on like a teeny, teeny, teeny tiny part of his base. And he didn't even finish

288
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,120
it. He like continue working on it from like the previous episode. And like here, I look at the

289
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,440
stuff I'm building. It's like, like a whole mega vase size, like build every episode. And I think

290
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,320
it's too much. I'm doing too much. So it takes like four times as long, which I don't know if

291
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:49,200
that's good or bad. But like, it's just I want it to be more frequent. But I don't know how to

292
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,760
divide it up enough to where I can be able to do that on a regular basis. So that's gonna be

293
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,720
something for next season to figure out and stuff. But we got more news today about like,

294
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,360
or not this today, but this week about the new Minecraft version. So they added like,

295
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,680
cherry blossom forest type thing as like a new biome and stuff. So that's kind of neat.

296
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,080
Yeah, but yeah, my mod series liking it. It's been a lot of fun. All right.

297
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,200
My gaming week. So early on, it was a lot of the similar stuff I always talk about on the show,

298
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,520
like Final Fantasy 14. I've been trying to get the trophies on the PlayStation five version,

299
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,720
because 14 on the PlayStation five has separate trophies from the PlayStation four and PlayStation

300
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,720
three loads. So that's been kind of fun to go through that. I played a little bit of crash

301
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,040
bandicoot the trilogy I played a little bit of the first game because that was one of the games

302
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,960
I just loaded onto my PlayStation five because I was like I picked that up and PlayStation Plus

303
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,000
at some point just never really played it. So I played a little bit of that. And then dead by

304
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,280
daylight just a little bit not a lot saw the latest info about the new killer and you know,

305
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,400
I mean, it looks all right. I don't know how well balanced that killer is going to be.

306
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,280
The new survivors are more interesting than the new killer, quite frankly.

307
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,280
The killer is really cool, but her Mori is crap.

308
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,440
The killer is a well designed character. I'm just not sure I'm into them as a killer,

309
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,920
but we'll see. I mean, they also tend to change things before the actual release. So we'll see.

310
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,600
I think she'll get a more interesting Mori but I really do like the the drone mechanic.

311
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,920
Oh, I will say this about that new killer as long as we're going to derail by daylight.

312
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,960
A lot of people were compared actually I really whoever said I'm sorry, some streamer said

313
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,200
their mechanics really remind them of the predator. And I was like,

314
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,000
that's a really interesting call out because predator DLC has been rumored for a long time.

315
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,480
Holly Esther did a video on if she was supposed to be predator or not.

316
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,440
And then I look at her face. And a lot of people say, oh, she's like Terminator,

317
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,560
she's like a T2 robot type of thing. And I could maybe see that type thing too. But you know what

318
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:09,280
she really looks like to me? Fem Kano. She's Fem Kano. She's not Kano, she's Kana. That's Kana.

319
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,800
That is that is what she is to me. She's Kano with the lasers and everything. That's her.

320
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,920
And that's why her Mori should be a laser burn like Kano's thing or the heart thing or something.

321
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,600
She's wearing a mask and it's not built into her. All of her stuff is add on.

322
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,680
I know, but it still reminds me of that.

323
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,400
But I was in a polyester stream when the PTB went live. You know, just hanging out and chatting and

324
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:39,600
watching the new killer. And there was a person who's like, yeah, she's like, X23,

325
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:48,640
who is now Wolverine for the record, there's two Wolverines, meets something else, you know.

326
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,880
And I was like, I don't know. I mean, they were just saying that she was way too derivative.

327
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:05,920
But I went and I actually ripped the model out of the game files. I actually went and downloaded

328
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,880
all of the game models so that I would have this PTBs worth of models. And when I put her together,

329
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:21,520
there's a lot of really good detail on her weapon that makes it look like something that she did

330
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,600
build herself. And I think that the best description of her is anti Batman.

331
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,520
Yeah, yeah. Oh, she's very anti Batman. But anyway,

332
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,840
She's like Batman, but a serial killer.

333
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,320
So anyway, Brazilian.

334
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,480
Yeah, yeah, it's all Brazilian pack, basically, because the survivors are a Brazilian brother

335
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,440
and sister too. So you know, fun to have different countries represented and all that.

336
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,760
So anyway, the bulk of my gaming week is they're easily calling out in the chat right now over

337
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,080
twitch.tv slash vog network, I've been playing this shit out of theater them final bar line,

338
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,440
because that released the middle of this week for PlayStation four and switch and I did pick

339
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,480
it up on PlayStation five backwards compatible PlayStation four, obviously. So I've been playing

340
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,520
a bit of that I had a little trouble getting it up and running. Something I found out was that the

341
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,920
3.0 dashboard beta for the PlayStation five, which I guess they were giving away codes that

342
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,480
you could give to your friends. So you know, Shane hooked me up with a code. And I installed that we

343
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,560
actually the beta dashboard is nice, because we were using discord on the PlayStation, as I was

344
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,280
getting my trophies unlocked and Final Fantasy 14 and all that. So there are good things about that

345
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,960
beta. But the bad thing is, it prevented theater them from unlocking on time. And it took me a

346
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,640
little bit to figure that out. And I was doing this all live. And I'd promised Oh, we're gonna

347
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,280
go in theater them right as its launches are going to be live. And of course, I get held up for 30

348
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,000
minutes trying to diagnose why it's not running. Finally, we figure out it's the beta. So anyway,

349
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,760
I hope they fix that for future releases, because that was annoying to say the least. But once I got

350
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,440
and that that's not a Square Enix problem. That's a Sony beta problem. And in complete fairness,

351
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,520
because somebody actually asked him I chat when that happened, like, Oh, are you gonna, you know,

352
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,640
tweet at Sony and you know, complain at him for what's going on. And I'm like, like, honestly,

353
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,240
this is why when you sign up for a beta, they warn you many times, the beta may be unstable,

354
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,120
you're in a beta for a reason to find problems like what I found the other night. So there's

355
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,600
really nobody to complain to. I fucked around and I found out so to speak, except you know,

356
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,760
I wasn't doing anything wrong. But that is just there are pitfalls to doing betas. And that is

357
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,640
one of them. So there's nobody to complain to. Luckily, it's very easy to revert. So I actually

358
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,920
give Sony credit for that it was very easy to revert and be able to get in the game right away

359
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:51,200
for that. So I've been playing the shit out of theater them. Every second of the game I've played

360
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,360
I've streamed so I played like three hours on Wednesday night, three hours on Thursday night,

361
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,920
four hours last night. I don't usually stream for more than four hours. But last night was

362
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:06,240
an exception. There's a definite lack of Angela Aki. I know you're so pressed about that. But

363
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,560
there's there's a lot of strange omissions. Considering that there are over 500 songs when

364
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,320
you count all the DLC and stuff. It does make the omissions stand out that much more. But I

365
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,280
understand that there are licensing issues and things like that. For you know, for you,

366
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,600
you're missing that song. For me, I was disappointed. They don't have any Endwalker

367
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,560
stuff from Final Fantasy 14. Because like close in the distance is one of the most amazing songs

368
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,400
ever written for a video game. And the fact that that's not in there is tragic. But maybe it'll be

369
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:45,760
DLC later. Who knows? The old da music like the the levels. I my favorite music in 14. I don't

370
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,920
know if old old does in there. I'd have to look at the list. So but they have like status. Yeah,

371
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,920
that's my favorite music in the entire game so far. There's a there's a lot of songs that are

372
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,160
missing. But there are a lot of songs that are in it. And I have to say overall, I don't want to

373
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,560
dwell on these missing songs because honestly, the game is incredible. Those those omissions aside,

374
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:11,760
like you know, things that are my jam Final Fantasy games, music games, retro games. This

375
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,960
really hits on all those points. And obviously, this is a formula that started 10 years ago,

376
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,360
I'm thrilled that I can play it on a non portable console now, being that it's on PlayStation,

377
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,480
not that I hate portable gaming, I just tend to play living room style games more often. And so

378
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,760
I'm thrilled that that's there. The only thing that gets a little bit wonky versus the DS are

379
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,880
the green control paths. They're really simplified since there's no stylus to trace with. It's just

380
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,920
kind of up and down. But the arcade version wasn't that much different all things considered.

381
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,240
I mean, it did have sensitivity, but you know, it's not too much of a departure from what it

382
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,680
was the arcade. And I think that's kind of what they were doing with this is they were really

383
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,840
trying to put all the music that they've done over the years, not just for the DS versions,

384
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,800
but for the arcade version, because a lot of those 14 songs were in the arcade version.

385
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
And they've kind of made like a definitive edition of this game because the arcade version

386
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,360
no longer has the online access. So this is kind of a way for fans of the arcade version,

387
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,680
as well as the DS version to have one last hurrah. They are saying it's the last one.

388
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,560
But we'll see. I mean, it seems like, you know, again, it might just be bias of the people around

389
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,840
me or the people I follow on social media. I know way more people that spent $100 on the digital

390
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:34,160
deluxe edition for theater them, then actually bought for spoken. And I'm sorry to be shady,

391
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,560
because I haven't played at all for spoken. I don't know if it's a good game or a bad game.

392
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,640
But I'm just saying for all the marketing and all the push that Square Enix put into that game,

393
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,240
I feel like this other little game sitting over here is just selling not just copies,

394
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:54,240
but collector's edition copies, basically, essentially. So, and st 100, Matt and chat says

395
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,480
would be cool if they added some Enix deep cuts, like it would be cool to hear some Actraiser in

396
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,280
there. Some of the songs they have coming for digital deluxe are great. Chrono Trigger and

397
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,800
Chrono Cross will be represented in a pack near automata. That alone, the fact that I'm going to

398
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:16,240
get to play way to the world is amazing. And live live is going to be pretty soon. I think it's the

399
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,440
next one coming. The first DLC pack was like two songs from Final Fantasy adventure. And then

400
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,240
Romancing Saga had some songs. I know Secret of Mana is on the deck at some point too. But not

401
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,480
Secret of Evermore, frown, because you know, some are complicated. It's it's weird, because there

402
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,720
are some Final Fantasy games that are represented that you literally can't play anymore. Final

403
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,240
Fantasy Mobius, Final Fantasy Record Keeper, those mobile games that are no longer supported. This is

404
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,760
pretty much all that exists of them now, which is interesting. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest has eight

405
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,480
songs represented, which is great because the soundtrack was the best part of Final Fantasy

406
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,080
Mystic Quest, quite honestly. So it's astounding that that's there. That's great. So yeah, it's

407
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,720
really fun to play along with the songs. There's a whole little meta game going on. You have

408
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,760
characters that you level as you play songs, and then you use those characters to complete quests.

409
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,920
You see this whole little background thing going on. And it looks like it's just idle background

410
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,920
animation at first until you realize that no, this game is actually going based on the success of

411
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,960
your notes and the things that you've equipped to your characters that like, oh, maybe cloud will do

412
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,800
a braver attack after you hit 50 critical notes in a row. Like and you have to build this to be able

413
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,040
to finish quests in the game. So this, there's definitely it wouldn't be a Final Fantasy game if

414
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,400
there wasn't some type of grind to go with it. So they've definitely built that into the game.

415
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,240
Apparently, not only can you level the 99, but then you can get stars after level 99. So you

416
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:58,320
literally have tons and tons of stuff to grind in that game. Garth the Wolf, I know you love Near.

417
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:06,160
What is the song with the robots and the boss where it goes, this cannot continue, this cannot

418
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,800
continue, and then it starts to get all like dancy as you're fighting the boss. That song

419
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:17,280
fucks. And I hope that is in the theater them near DLC pack because that was probably my favorite

420
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,800
song that was in the just just the way it turned the computer. Like as you're playing the game,

421
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,480
the way it turned like what was happening into the game into the music was like incredible. So

422
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,240
Birth of a Wish. That's right. Because I know I've looked that up on YouTube before. Birth of a Wish.

423
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,800
I hope that songs in there. So yeah, it's an alternate there because the Japanese version does

424
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,680
the same thing. Although they're saying a phrase in Japanese instead. But it does. It's the same

425
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,880
trick. So it's very cool. Anyway. Alright, so I don't I don't know what else to say about

426
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,360
theater them. Like if you like music games, if you like Final Fantasy games, you've probably

427
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,280
already bought the $100 edition. I you don't need to hear any more from me. But then again, I will

428
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,000
say since I've been streaming the game so much. I have actually had two people tell me I bought

429
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,840
this game from watching you play the stream. Thanks for showing me what this game is all

430
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,920
about to which I say influencer. Where's my code next Times Square? Where's my code?

431
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Oh, maybe two and a half SSJ 100 Matt says maybe I'll get this sometime down the road.

432
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,320
I will say there is a multiplayer. I only played it a little bit. But it's kind of it's kind of

433
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,120
neat. I like that, you know, they put I don't like all the little like, oh, the fat chocobos

434
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:41,200
hide the lane, or extra squares and triangles get in there or you know, I don't like all those silly

435
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,680
little moves. But you can actually play multiplayer with those off. So I do like how

436
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,600
highly customizable it is. Actually, on the customizable note, I'll let this be my final

437
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,240
thought on theater them and then we'll move on. On the customizable note. I do love like there's

438
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,360
four levels of difficulty, right? Basic and then expert is actually the medium difficulty ultimate

439
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,960
and then like, you're sick. I don't know what the last level is called. But to me, it's you're sick.

440
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,200
Those are like the 17 level songs. You can actually play the songs on your sick mode in

441
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,320
simple mode. And how does that work? It takes out all of the yellow flicks, because there's parts of

442
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,880
the song where you have to flick the little controller in the direction and the whole it

443
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,240
takes all of those out. So you're only hitting button presses. So for some people, that might

444
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,040
be easier than trying to do. Oh, thank you. Supreme is what it's called. Not the your sick mode.

445
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:40,080
Um, but yeah, that's cool. But the only downside to that whole thing is that it is not cross

446
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:47,120
platform. So the Switch version and the PlayStation version are on islands, you can't

447
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:53,280
even trade cards profile cards with people on the other platform, which is a bummer. But that's my

448
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,520
one little. I wish they did this different, but I also kind of get it. Ah, boo. Bobby Black Wolf says

449
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,880
birth of a wish is not in the near pack. Damn it. So good. All right. So you know, they're even

450
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,080
though they say it's the final one. Look, we keep naming songs where it's like even though 500 songs

451
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,680
are represented. I mean, if you if you like battle on the big bridge from Final Fantasy Five, let me

452
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,600
tell you, the Gilgamesh song is remixed like six different times in this game, you will not be

453
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:31,440
disappointed by the amount of Greg in this game. But there are still some omissions. So if they

454
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,640
ever wanted to do a theater them on core or whatever the fuck they want to call it. There's

455
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,040
still some songs they could put in it. And I think the real gag would be put Kingdom Hearts in it

456
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,560
because Melody of Memories was not it. Put Kingdom Hearts in theater them you cowards.

457
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:54,080
Or you know what? Give us fucking Dragon Quest. Bring the Dragon Quest game out locally. Look,

458
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,480
I know you didn't do it here because you haven't released Dragon Quest 10 here and you want to

459
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,040
pretend we don't know that Dragon Quest 10 is a game even though you've literally released 9 and

460
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,640
11 like Square. We know. We know. And Square Enix also put out an offline version of Dragon Quest 10

461
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,080
in Japan. Why they have not brought that over here still? I don't know. But the Dragon Quest

462
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,760
game would be great. And lots of other stuff. Anyway, Garth the Wolf in chat says the nail in

463
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,160
the coffin for the Kingdom Hearts rhythm game is no Utada songs were in it. I'm gonna tell you

464
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,480
what the nail in that coffin game was was allowing Nomura or whoever's idea it was to say, well, but

465
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:41,040
this is Kingdom Hearts. We need to change the theater them formula. Bad move. Because that game

466
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:48,800
is not it. But if they want to go back and you know what put in the theater them stuff. As Joe

467
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:56,160
and Hunter Matt says, as final as BeatMania the final that theater them 2DX. Make it happen.

468
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,160
Well, we have a story later on in the show where maybe we will see theater them in another form.

469
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,560
But I will wait until we get that back or until we get to that part of the show. In the meantime,

470
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,360
we have some stories to get into. I am gonna let Loki have it with this first story tonight.

471
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,400
Yes, let's talk about all the good news with Activision Blizzard. Just kidding. There's

472
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,920
no good news. It's never good news. It's Activision Blizzard. So we have statements

473
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:30,480
being made by Mike Ybarra of Blizzard as part of a company wide QA. Some of the things that he did

474
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:37,520
was downplay the stack ranking that was something that was brought up by one developers that was

475
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,440
leaving the company. Basically saying, you know, we don't stack rank employees one through exit

476
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,280
Blizzard, we have a high expectations over teams manager set goals, blah, blah, blah.

477
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,520
That doesn't seem to necessarily reflect the the opinions of folks that are leaving the company

478
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,480
because of that reason. But you know, along with that, you know, he also said something

479
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,480
to the effect that if you think that executives are making a lot of money and you aren't,

480
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,560
you're living in a myth. Like, like executives at Activision Blizzard aren't making a lot of money.

481
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,920
I don't believe that. At the end of the day, we want people to be happy and decisions about

482
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,240
being happy don't align with with where we're going. And you won't be happy, then you you'll

483
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,200
have to do will make you happy. In other words, we're going to do what we want. And you got to

484
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:38,240
get out of here. Other fun stuff that they've been talking about as well. They're making their

485
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:45,200
employees go back to the office, because everybody loves that. Hey, you like remote work, go back to

486
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,640
the office. Because in my opinion, they just probably can't sexually harass the people

487
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,920
remotely. So they got to bring people in the office so they can continue with their bad

488
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,360
behavior to begin with. That's a little much. I have a comment about that I had been off for

489
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:08,240
however many about six months I'd gone shopping. I've been wearing my mask. I didn't go out for a

490
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:16,080
week. I went back in the office for two days and got COVID. Yeah, I don't know why anyone would

491
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:23,040
want to go back. We had a I know, like the company I work at, we're allegedly permanently remote,

492
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,160
because they don't have the office space anymore. They leased it out or sold it or whatever,

493
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,320
which is good. But there's like a like, a handful of people, actually, I should say like,

494
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,800
two that wanted to work in the office. And so now because of that, they're doing this thing,

495
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,960
like once a month where they, they go back in the office, and it's not even like a team building

496
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,560
thing. It's just we're just going to work in the office one day. And it's such a hassle because

497
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,120
you got to like lug all of your equipment over there. You have to reserve a spot because they

498
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,640
don't have a scientific anymore. And you have to expose yourself to all these people that are just

499
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,360
terrible. I kind of want to do that. You know, it's interesting. Alan and I work at the same

500
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,360
place. I'm not going to say much more than that on air. We do very different jobs. Alan actually

501
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,880
goes into the office by choice. Our company is also remote like that. But two things that are

502
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,520
important in context. Number one, we live less than a mile from the home office. So commuting

503
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,240
really isn't a problem. And number two, Alan is very much like, when I'm done with work,

504
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,160
I want to get up and walk away and physically leave my work. And I'm kind of like, I respect

505
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,600
that. Like, yeah, I get that. So you know, when it's convenient for him to do, I get that. But

506
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,040
I feel like it's like maybe him and one other person in that very large area that

507
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,960
that the work is our work is starting to get rid of spaces to and leasing or whatever. So

508
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,280
very, very interesting. Now for the company that I work at, because our culture is very different

509
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,240
from a lot of corporate cultures. And people who know me know where I work, but I'm not saying it

510
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:01,920
on the air again. Um, the culture of my work is built around discussion and debate, and an

511
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:12,480
exchange of ideas and having individual expertise. So I understand why our culture dictates having

512
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:21,120
people together. At the same time, for those of us who have been doing other services within

513
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:27,680
the company who aren't in the management realm or the decision making realm, or the production

514
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:34,880
realm, I, I don't see a need for it. You know, we we have a slack channel, I interact with my

515
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,640
co workers that way, I reach out to managers and departments that I want to eventually join and

516
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,960
make friends with them. You know, I learned about everything, we can still reach out and have that

517
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:56,560
spirit of communication without actually sharing the same space. And we're back on a on a hybrid.

518
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:05,600
So we go in, no matter what your schedule are, everybody, if they are working a Tuesday,

519
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,120
Wednesday or Thursday, they go into the office. So for me, that means that like on my schedule now,

520
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,800
my Wednesdays and Thursdays are spent in office and my Friday and Saturday is worked at home.

521
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:27,440
Um, it's, I'm fine with a hybrid schedule, but I still think that there's the sense of denial

522
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:35,520
about the overall necessity and safety and going back into the office. And I think especially

523
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:42,720
because the pandemic is not over. I will repeat that the pandemic is not over.

524
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:50,560
And that is still not the time to be forcing people to go into these environments, harassment,

525
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:57,360
you know, apart from from that, which by the way, at my work, our, our corporate training

526
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:07,600
on harassment has really stepped up its game since this whole thing has gone on. But I think

527
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:15,200
I think that given that baseline that every company is having to deal with,

528
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,360
and then given the environment of this particular volatile company,

529
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,480
they're making a really bad call. And not just that, but like their performance

530
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:36,400
reviews, the the questionnaire they sent out to their employees. I've talked to a few people

531
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:45,040
this bullshit. Yeah, I mean, we have we have a ranking for like choosing our schedules

532
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,080
based on performance. But I think that this company is also still being resistant about

533
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:58,400
people discussing their pay, which by the way, no matter what employer tells you not to discuss

534
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,400
your pay, you have a legal right to and everyone should be transparent about what they make and

535
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,560
discuss it with others. You need to be paid what you're fucking worth. But going back,

536
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:23,760
but going back to to that, you know, it's it's really this the state of corporate control,

537
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:31,040
I think is what it goes over. They want to have more control over what their employees are doing,

538
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,320
be able to observe them, especially given the resistance of Activision Blizzard to

539
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:45,680
recent unionization attempts. I think what they're doing really wrong here is that and this is for

540
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,920
any company, really not just Activision Blizzard. But if you want to pull people back into the

541
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,840
office, you really have to explain the why the what's in it for them. Why is the company doing

542
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:02,720
this? What is the reason besides, and just people work better in person is not an acceptable reason,

543
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,440
because these companies did not go bankrupt in the last three years, they've weathered the pandemic.

544
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,120
So you have to be able to explain the why. And until you can do that, to an audience,

545
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,720
it's already a little bit unhappy with a lot of your business practices,

546
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,920
you're not going to win your employees over. And it's as simple as that.

547
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,640
Yeah, and I like it at my job, because they have a legitimate reason as to why.

548
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,960
Just, you know, because is not a reason, right?

549
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,040
Loki, yeah. And to and to that point, you know, the majority of them don't want to go back to

550
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,880
the office full time or part time, they still feel that the risks don't outweigh the benefits.

551
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,000
On top of that, you know, further work from home arrangements, they said have resulted employees

552
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,720
having more time since they aren't losing and commute, lower gas insurance costs. And, you know,

553
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:02,160
as well as the ability to live further away from the office. Also, you know, there's childcare,

554
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,280
schooling, all that stuff, like, I completely understand that. And I know, like, some of,

555
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,800
like, especially the company I work for leadership has tried to make the argument like,

556
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,560
well, in person, you know, it like, it's, it'll help out with like, some of the issues that are

557
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,400
going on with like, poor training and stuff. And I have to remind them like, yeah, but this has

558
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,160
been going on, like, well, before we went out on the pandemic, like, this is not going to change

559
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,680
if we're in the office, and they will know what we do anyways, even if we were in office. So

560
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,640
it's, yeah, it's, it's unfortunate. I know a lot of companies are kind of like, trying to

561
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,800
force this a little bit. I don't think it's a good idea.

562
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,940
Hmm.

563
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,560
Well, we'll see. I mean, this doesn't really change until these employees start leaving,

564
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:55,920
unionize, let their voices, you know, be let some actions speak behind those voices. I'm not saying,

565
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,720
and I'm not saying they need to or they have to or whatever. I'm just saying, like, unfortunately,

566
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,840
management is very clearly not hearing them. And it's not until these sorts of and this could be

567
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,440
any company like today, it's about Activision Blizzard tomorrow, it'll be about somebody else

568
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:17,520
in the industry, this insert company here. If they don't, you know, start making these changes,

569
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,560
then some other company that does these types of things is going to snatch them up.

570
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,280
Phil and I in in chat says, Oh, I heard from a bliss friend, they were not happy with the

571
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,600
decision. And that's when you start, what do they call that rage applying? When you just I'm just

572
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,800
going to start applying to other jobs and see what happens. That's when that I mean, heck,

573
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,360
I left a company I was with for 14 years because I was under the belief my job was going to be

574
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:51,040
outsourced. It actually never was outsourced. But I because of some actions and things I was

575
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,880
convinced and other people had been outsourced. I was convinced it was going to be so I started

576
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,560
rage applying and guess what I got a job where I made more money. So I left.

577
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,680
Yeah, like if I can complain for a few seconds, I could actually complain for a lot longer than

578
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:11,440
that. But like, I will keep it short. For example, I've I've been complaining that like,

579
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,320
obviously, you feel very overworked. I'm doing a lot more work that feels like outside of my

580
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:21,760
job description. And I've been at the company for at least in this position for like over seven

581
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:29,200
years. And I am literally making the state mandated minimum wage for an exempt employee,

582
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,920
seven years of experience in this department, integral to the running of this department,

583
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:43,280
two of my employees, same, same everything. They left to go to another department, they're hiring

584
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,680
two new employees in those people with zero experience in this position will be making

585
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,680
the same amount of money as I am. There is nothing that they're going to do for me.

586
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,480
They basically said, Well, if you want more money, you're probably going to,

587
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,640
you're being compensated fairly. And if you want more money, you probably have to get look outside

588
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:09,680
of the department. So like, it's just, they've been, they've been walking on eggshells around

589
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,720
me because I've just I've lost all patience for everything with them. Like a night.

590
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:22,880
As the last promotion I got at that job that I was at for 14 years, I got that promotion because

591
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,640
I bid for a different department and I got offered the job and I said, I'm leaving because

592
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,480
I'm not getting promoted here. There's no movement in this department. I am for as much of these

593
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,720
accolades that I get for what I do. And I have the facts back it up. I'm never getting promoted.

594
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,440
I get a call back the next day. That's basically like, if you try, if you will pull your name from

595
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,880
consideration for that, you can choose if you want to go this path or this path. It was wild.

596
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,080
I couldn't, I couldn't believe that it happened that way. But it did.

597
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,720
Yeah. And, and considering that these two, there's three people that were doing that role in that

598
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,840
department. Now there's one, I am the one that knows all of the information. Not a good time

599
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:07,840
to piss me off. Because if I leave your department screwed, it's gone. Because you have literally

600
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,320
high level explanations of how to do things. I think you're gonna have to always apply and get

601
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,440
the get the offer. And then they'll listen. If it's not too late. And it's right right into what

602
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,920
as Joe and Matt says here in chat, we have a mental health crisis worldwide. I think folks

603
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,680
have really found the comfort of being able to work from home. Because you have that flexibility

604
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,720
to step away from your job in your own space, pet your cat, dog, etc. Take care of your kids. I

605
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,680
don't know the best answer to fix or create a work balance. But I think rushing people back in and

606
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,720
saying, well, if you don't like it, leave is a toxic strategy. Because guess and I'm adding to

607
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,960
that comment saying because guess what they're getting ready to leave. Yeah, I actually like

608
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,520
I'd only been back to work for like, maybe four days. It was my last day of training. And I was

609
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:59,200
looking at the job site, there was a position that was there. That was totally up my alley.

610
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:06,080
And it even said in the job description, you just have to meet some of these requirements. We want

611
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:12,080
people who are completely different. It's like for a design prototyping group. And you better believe

612
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:20,080
I touched up my resume, completely the style they want at work. And I had my app in, you know,

613
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:26,000
and I'm gonna keep doing that. And I've even started looking at like industry jobs, like the

614
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,720
one for the Pokemon company that I told you about the other day. And if I have to move, I will move

615
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,800
because I'll be making the money. You know, they start off at like, for this one job, that's like

616
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:45,360
stuff I do anyway, at like double my salary, just under double my salary. And I would move

617
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:50,400
to Washington for that. We can still do all our we've been doing it virtually for how long?

618
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:56,640
Since 2020. Really? So yeah, and, and it's not like, you know, I don't see you guys from time

619
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:06,400
to time. But, but you know, I would, sometimes you just have to be done. Does that make sense?

620
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,920
No, I get it. Yeah, you have to be willing to be done. And take, take that risk. And if you

621
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:21,440
like the company that you work at and believe in the company, then you need to be also be

622
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:28,160
willing to take brave steps to improve what you love. I have to always be critical of what you

623
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:35,680
love. I have to say like, I, where I'm at now, I'm completely happy. I think that companies invested

624
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,920
in me in a way that no other company I've worked at has before. I have met some of my career goals

625
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,680
at this company. I'm being paid what I should be paid and, you know, have some good benefits to go

626
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,240
with that. I have, I work with amazing people. Like I really can't complain. Like my day job

627
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,000
is great. It's one thing you're not going to hear me complain about. So, will that still be the case

628
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,440
in five, 10 years? That probably depends on if the CEO has changed and what type of work culture the

629
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,560
new CEO would bring with them if they keep up the ideals of the current person. Because again,

630
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,560
and we've said this since the very beginning of these Activision Blizzard stories, the culture

631
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,560
comes from the top down. And that's why Bobby Kotick is unqualified to work in this industry.

632
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:26,320
He is not qualified to be the CEO of a major company the way he is. But because of systems

633
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:32,720
being set up the way they are, he's there. And that is what it is. But the culture really is

634
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,560
set from the top down. And at least where I'm at now, I have the good fortune that we got a

635
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,840
good guy at the helm that sets a good culture from the top down. And that is exactly why I like where

636
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:52,080
I work. So. I like that about my job too. Yeah. All right, let's move on. And let's talk about

637
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,880
other things going on in gaming. Let's talk about something that I'm not sure a lot of companies are

638
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,440
on board for because we were talking about that a couple weeks ago on the show. But it sounds like

639
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:08,720
Ubisoft may be in to attend E3 2023. There was a report, of course, that came out a couple weeks

640
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,400
ago that said Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo won't be going to E3 in June. But one company that does

641
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,520
want to be there is Ubisoft. Speaking to investors, Yves Guillemonde, who also is not qualified to be

642
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:28,240
doing what he is doing, but here we are, said, if E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a

643
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,040
lot of things to show. It was a very simple comment, but it obviously has turned a lot of

644
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,160
heads because that's one of the major publishers that is committing to E3. But what's interesting

645
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:47,520
about that, if E3 happens, you know, this is a good point to bring up. By the time our show comes

646
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:55,840
back in two weeks, it will be March 6th. That means there will be three months until June,

647
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:05,600
middle of June. 90 days is that sweet spot to book travel. If E3 is, so I'm going to assume

648
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,400
one of the storylines we're going to miss next week, or maybe we'll be able to touch it on the

649
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,800
March 6th show, but I'm almost certain in the next two weeks, we're going to have a go or a no go on

650
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,360
E3. They're either going to say it's happening, here it is, here's the time, and here's all the

651
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,960
people that are coming, Ubisoft, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Or we're going to get their

652
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,560
release. Ubisoft 3. It's E3. Three companies are coming.

653
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,280
E3. Or they're going to put out the press release that says,

654
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,880
unfortunately, due to continued COVID concerns, we're canceling the show.

655
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,400
Yeah. They'll blame COVID for sure.

656
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,120
Because 100% they're not going to blame themselves.

657
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,160
No.

658
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:48,800
Who does that?

659
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,920
No. No.

660
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,960
So, I think that's going to be an interesting thing to tell in the next couple of weeks.

661
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:01,200
Because again, you can't expect, especially international coming from Japan, you cannot

662
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:08,000
expect those folks to make those types of travel plans less than three months in advance. This

663
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
thing, and if we come back in two weeks and E3 isn't confirmed or canceled, I'm in a different

664
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,920
state of what the fuck. Because I'm like, they're really going to try to pull off a

665
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,480
show with 60 days notice or something. That is ludicrous. But also another example of

666
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,720
how the ESA needs to get their shit together. And has been needed to get their shit together.

667
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,960
Dr. C in chat says, I have to wonder what they'd even show.

668
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,600
Rayman's main series been dead for a while. Don't hold out much hope for Assassin's Creed,

669
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,520
Splitter Cell, maybe Prince of Persia.

670
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,120
Well, there's

671
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,800
Beyond Good and Evil. I'm just kidding.

672
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:57,600
I was gonna say the there's a rumors of speculation, I guess. From insider gaming that

673
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:03,840
says basically Just Dance 2024, Assassin's Creed, Mirage of Nexus, The Division Heartland,

674
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:09,360
X Defiant, Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones. Again, the continuing saga.

675
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,960
There's enough crap. That's what is there's enough crap.

676
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:21,280
All right. But we'll see. We'll see. So I again, in two weeks, I expect we know what the summer

677
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,640
looks like. Because we don't know what the summer looks like 90 days out. I don't know what the fuck

678
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:32,000
this industry is doing right now. We'll see. All right, moving on Dark Sakura.

679
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,640
Okay, so I'm going into a little bit more of a legal side of things.

680
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,440
And this actually isn't like necessarily legal, but I have a feeling it could go that way.

681
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:57,200
There is basically a limit that the UK is asking these companies to put on the data that they

682
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:05,920
gather from people who play different games. There is a report by the information commissioners

683
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:13,440
office that they want video games to to bolster and enforce age restriction. They stated that

684
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,320
video games should include a stronger age assurance features for those who are below 18.

685
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,600
They've published a list of tips and recommendations on how developers

686
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:31,520
can go about this. Of course, it goes both ways. They say that the personal data of children should

687
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,560
only be collected and processed if it is not detrimental to their health or well-being.

688
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,760
Going a little bit further into that, the ICO is recommending that any optional use of personal

689
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:54,160
data is set to off by default with consent being given by a parent or guardian. Product placement,

690
01:04:54,160 --> 01:05:00,000
paid promotions, and collaborations should be monitored, especially in community servers.

691
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:08,240
They want to put checkpoints like periodic saving of progress and natural breaks in play between

692
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:14,000
game matches into the game design. So that basically, you know, it was sort of like what

693
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,640
they were kind of trying to do with WoW. They're saying, you've been playing for a while. Do you

694
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:28,000
want a break? You know, so they want to put up explanations and prompts of steps if, especially

695
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,640
if like a child is trying to change the settings or maybe have something that goes back to the

696
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:40,800
adults, like also things like disabling voice chat. I mean, and I think that's reasonable,

697
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:48,320
you know, for younger kids. Yeah, I think it's not obscene what they're asking here.

698
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah. And one of the things they even say, I'm looking at the guidelines, I'll just read this

699
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,680
verbatim. It's called buff your age assurance, know your players' ages. It says that the age

700
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:04,320
range of your players and the different needs of children at different ages and stages of

701
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,720
development should be at the heart of how you design your games and apply the code.

702
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:19,600
So I think that having sort of a floating age level, you know, might be pretty good.

703
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:26,640
There's another one on here about open world gameplay. So they're saying on here,

704
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:33,440
bad privacy information design obscures risks, unravels good player experiences,

705
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,840
and sows mistrust between children, parents, and game providers. You could run user research to

706
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,120
trial child-friendly privacy information with different age groups, display transparency

707
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:50,960
information on ability rather than age, you know, so like list at beginner, intermediate,

708
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:58,320
and expert levels, and design different communication methods for how to appropriately

709
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:04,000
relay information or in return gather information from children.

710
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,960
They actually even did another thing on here looking this over about guidance to explain

711
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:18,800
how online services will spot detrimental use of children's data. And also the children's code

712
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,040
with guidance to help assess the best interest of children. There's another interesting one here

713
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:31,040
about stealth mode with high privacy settings and parental controls. And that's having to,

714
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,960
it's something that provides parents with real-time alerts about what their children

715
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,520
are playing or how long they've been playing. Or if the, you know, like I said before about

716
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:45,520
the child trying to change the privacy settings or, you know, different things like that.

717
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:53,200
There's also, you know, giving parents the freedom to assess the maturity of their child,

718
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:01,600
you know, and there's also a request to put in like a do not disturb setting,

719
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:11,600
you know, so that it would like not send like friend requests or to say it would disable voice

720
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:22,080
chat or allow only people of the same age group to communicate with children, you know,

721
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:32,480
offering profiling in game. And it's funny on here pushing FOMO. It says it is crucial that

722
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,840
games do not use nudge techniques to lead children to make poor privacy decisions.

723
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,000
So basically eliminating the fear of missing out.

724
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,040
And there's even ones on here where they're requesting people to volunteer as auditors.

725
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,880
Oh, that's, that's where these issues get dicey when they invite the community to

726
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:59,840
arbitrate what is and what isn't appropriate. But I look at this more like doing like the Gallup

727
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:05,360
poll. I'm going to put this particular link here in in chat because at my old job when I worked

728
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:15,200
for the money store, I used to help with the Gallup feedback. And one of the good things I

729
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:22,000
like about that is that while this is gathered from communities participating in so such in the

730
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:30,960
other, and getting their opinion, it's something that is used by experts. So it's data, it's

731
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,400
information, it's feedback, it's complaining, I fully believe a complaint can be a gift,

732
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:44,080
because it's an opportunity to do better. At the at the same time, I think that the information

733
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:50,560
that comes from surveys like this or from, you know, community auditing should be implemented

734
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:57,200
by the people who are qualified to do so. I will be interesting to see what effect this

735
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:02,480
could have on future game development. There's gonna be something going in as

736
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,760
legislation before too long, because you know, people do like to pass their laws.

737
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,040
And the UK is tending to regulate a lot of these things stricter than we are over here for sure.

738
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:15,840
So you know, and obviously, the company I work for follows like European standards for privacy.

739
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:23,360
Yeah. Most companies have to. Yeah. So that's why all the websites you go to now, like all of them

740
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,880
say like the cookie stuff that all came from the Europe laws, not the US laws. So yeah, and

741
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:36,480
I'm always like, No, I do not want you to target ads or do all this shit. I mean, one one thing I

742
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:43,520
actually super like about because I stopped using Chrome because Chrome is a resource hog. Like for

743
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,640
people who open different instances of Chrome or different tabs of Chrome, it is eating your RAM

744
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,760
and your processor, not me with five Chrome tabs open right now.

745
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,640
I've actually gone back to just using Safari for everything. I mean, and it's not just because,

746
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,920
you know, I love my Mac, and it's a native app. But I've really gotten to where I like the fact

747
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:17,440
it records the trackers and blocks the majority of them. I keep ghostery open in the background as

748
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:28,560
well. And it's been between the two of those, I've really just enjoyed the greater sense of

749
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:38,160
privacy I've gotten from it. And, you know, but I when I was on my PC, I was using, I was using

750
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:44,240
Chrome because of the compatibility with stuff, but I started using Opera a lot more. And, you

751
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:50,160
know, and there's also I would even say, and this is going into general tips, make sure that your

752
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:58,160
search engine also has its own privacy protocols in place as well. Like a lot of people are fond

753
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:06,080
of DuckDuckGo. You know, even, you know, if you're really concerned about it, consider investing in

754
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:17,360
a VPN. Pretty cheap now. Yeah, like I have a VPN that I turn on by demand. And usually it's when I

755
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,600
want to look at stuff on the BBC website. I had to use one because my Comcast connection was that

756
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,720
shitty for playing Final Fantasy 14 at one point. But anyway, I digress. I mean, I have my work VPN

757
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:33,760
for when I work from home, but I really am a bigger advocate now of doing different things.

758
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,080
Like since I stopped playing Stadia, I stopped using Chrome.

759
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,120
All right. Because Stadia was only working in Chrome.

760
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:46,400
Let's move on, though. We got to get the rest of the news. So let's get to our next story. So

761
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,920
funny enough, we brought up AI earlier in the show and now we have another story about AI.

762
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:58,400
Yeah. So there's been a team from the University of Copenhagen who has put together a Mario GPT

763
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:05,920
that can generate levels in Super Mario Brothers based off of a text prompt.

764
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,800
It's very rudimentary. You can't actually I don't think you can actually play the levels.

765
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:18,240
It's just more of a graphical representation of them. But, you know, it's apparently the first

766
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:28,880
text to level model in existence. So it's neat. It's not sure what you can really do with this,

767
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:35,360
but it's a neat concept. I guess it's very basic. So like they have like some screenshots of like,

768
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,200
you know, many pipes, many enemies, little blocks, low elevation. And you kind of get

769
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:46,480
like a regular level, many pipes, many enemies. And it's all pipes. So not going to replace Mario

770
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,720
Maker anytime soon, but it's a neat idea. It's a neat concept.

771
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,720
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see like, I mean, I guess we've had games in the past that kind of

772
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:02,400
like use a simple AI to develop levels on the fly like as you're playing them. But it's interesting

773
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,200
to see how that might get more complex for a more complex platform or like, you know, a little big

774
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:14,480
planet, little AI planet or whatever that just starts to generate levels. Although not that that

775
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,360
means it would be good necessarily, because sometimes AI levels, you can kind of tell

776
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,160
they're generated by robot, you know, so. Yeah, it's just a kind of a neat proof of

777
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:30,640
concept right now. Yeah. All right. Well, what was an amazing proof of concept when it came out was

778
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:35,840
the game Tetris Effect. And Tetris Effect has already been re-released as Tetris Effect

779
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,560
Connected. And now it's going to be basically getting another big update. They're not giving

780
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,280
it a new subtitle, but Tetris Effect Connected will be getting an update alongside the launch

781
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:52,400
of the game on PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation VR 2. It will have some new game modes, which are

782
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:59,360
classic score attack, which looks like the old 1989 Tetris Nintendo game, the official licensed

783
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:05,840
Nintendo game, not the Tengen one. And then there's a version called zone marathon, which is

784
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,840
the marathon mode, but with that zone mechanic, which was new to Tetris Effect where you can kind

785
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:15,440
of like freeze things for a little bit. That's all built. That's how you get the 24 line Tetris

786
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,480
or whatever, all that stuff that's in the zone stuff. There also is purify mode where you can

787
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,200
now do an endless mode and master mode, which also has an endless mode. So there's a whole little

788
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:30,480
video if you want to check out that. But yeah, you can pretty much get this game just about on

789
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,680
every game front, including on PC via steam and Epic game store. It's even on quest because it is

790
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:43,360
a VR game. It's it is even on Luna. So Tetris Effect is really everywhere.

791
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,800
So now they just did you catch the Tetris movie trailer?

792
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:53,840
I did see the Tetris movie trailer and I was pleasantly surprised that it is not a game where

793
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:00,160
they like, Oh, let's turn Tetris into a movie. It is a movie about the release of the game Tetris

794
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:06,320
that wasn't in the original like, oh, Apple TV got the rights to do a Tetris movie or whatever it was

795
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,320
in the beginning. I think a lot of us were assuming they're going to do a movie based on

796
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:16,160
Tetris. That's silly. But now that we see from the trailer, oh, it's about the release of Tetris.

797
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,840
And getting that, you know, you know, during that era, especially, you know, in the 80s, when that

798
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:28,880
game came over, getting a Russian game and okay, okay, I get it. It looks interesting. So yeah.

799
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,520
Yeah, I saw that shared in our discord. I see some folks in our chat talking about that tire class

800
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,280
says that trailer was released. And it's not what you expect. Looks like a fun and entertaining

801
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,600
movie, given the circumstances that were involved to bring the game to the US. Yeah, I'm curious if

802
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,680
they might get into some of the because you can see that Nintendo is represented in there. I'm

803
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:52,400
curious if they'll get into some of the tengan Atari versus Nintendo stuff when it came to

804
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:57,440
Tetris. I don't know if that's a little too in the weeds for a movie plot, but it'll be interesting.

805
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,640
Questbuster says that Tetris trailer was wild, as Joe and Matt says that movie does look

806
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:09,120
interesting. Yeah, so it'll be interesting. And I think streaming is a good place for that.

807
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,040
I'm not sure as many people would have ran to the theater to see something like that. I mean,

808
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:18,320
I might have, but I think streaming is a really good place for a movie like that. I think it'll

809
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,920
actually catch more eyeballs there than it will with a traditional release. So good on Apple for

810
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:30,320
picking that up. All right, let's move on. Let's move on to a game that maybe more big game

811
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:39,040
developers should pick up. Dark Soccer, I think this one's yours. Yeah, Cocaine Bear. That's all

812
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:47,040
I need to say. A lot of people are talking about this one. I'm probably never going to see it

813
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,840
because it honestly sounds like the dumbest thing I've ever heard. That's exactly why we need to see

814
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,200
it. Every time I see the trailer, I'm like, if Loki had become a movie director, this is what

815
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,240
he would have made. There is enough stupid in my life that I don't need to be adding to it.

816
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:09,600
I love stupid movies. IDGAF. The only way this can get better is if Cocaine Bear can join the

817
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:15,200
Fast and the Furious crew for Fast 11. So that's the only way this can get better. What if they

818
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:22,320
did Cocaine Bear versus Sharknado? I mean, I'm fine with the extended Cocaine Bear universe.

819
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:28,000
What about Cocaine Bearnado? Well, the first movie has to succeed first, and then there will

820
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,760
absolutely be a sequel like Cocaine Bear 2 Electric Boogaloo. Absolutely a potential thing

821
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:43,360
if this movie makes a lot of money. Well, at any rate, they're going to be doing a tie-in web-based

822
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:51,280
game called Cocaine Bear 8-Bit Game. If you go to cocainebear.movie.game,

823
01:18:52,320 --> 01:19:00,480
then you can play a game as the Cocaine Bear. I think they have the subtitle Rise of the Escobar.

824
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:09,680
Yeah, the play button on this thing is covering the title. But I'm going to look at the game.

825
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:16,800
It's very loud. That's what I found. It's clearly built to play on a phone browser.

826
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:27,920
Also, there's a link on here that I just followed, and apparently Elizabeth Banks has Cocaine Bear's

827
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:35,120
head in her office. I think she's the director. Yeah. Which is hilarious. Not the real Cocaine

828
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,720
Bear, but not like a taxidermied head. From the movie.

829
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,200
Yeah, but I think that's funny. Tigerclaws says,

830
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:48,000
the movie is loosely based on the true story, but the movie takes huge liberties on the story.

831
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,360
I would hope that they do. I hope so. S.G.O. and Hunter Matt

832
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:56,880
does confirm she is the director. She was a great Rita Repulsa for the record. I

833
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,920
actually enjoyed that Power Rangers reboot movie, and she did good in that role.

834
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:12,960
By the way, slightly off topic, I watched this thing that I didn't even know was a thing where

835
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:19,120
they had Street Fighter versus Power Rangers, and it was a real Power Rangers thing.

836
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:27,120
It had the actual actors in it and everything, and it was a trip to watch.

837
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:32,960
Well, there's a new Power Rangers thing coming to Netflix that has the actual original...

838
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,160
They're in their fucking 50s now doing Power Rangers shit. Although, as we know,

839
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:43,360
the yellow one passed away in a car accident years ago. I think it's like her daughter or...

840
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,440
What's his face? Killed himself.

841
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,400
Yeah, but he wasn't in the original original, if I remember right.

842
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,360
Yeah, he was.

843
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,160
Was he? I thought he didn't come out till the next season or something.

844
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:52,960
Green Ranger.

845
01:20:52,960 --> 01:21:02,640
Oh, okay. Well, the movie was shot before he passed, so he could be in it in a cameo.

846
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,480
He was in the thing that I watched, the Street Fighter thing,

847
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,880
so it was a very interesting watch. If I can find it again... This has Ray Liotta in it,

848
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,840
Cocaine Bear.

849
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:21,840
Oh, it's got a lot of... This is the year people are just unleashing their pandemic

850
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,920
frustrations out on film.

851
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,960
Hey, I'll go see it.

852
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,240
They need a test, baby, to tighten up the game design in level three,

853
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,560
because it froze after I beat it.

854
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,120
All right, well, since Star... Oh, go ahead.

855
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,240
But at any rate, yeah.

856
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,680
Okay, since Star Saga brought up the versus Street Fighter thing, it's a nice little tie

857
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,040
into the next story, which has to do with that, right, Loki?

858
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,280
This is a fighting game I'd love to see, but instead we're getting a comic

859
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,560
or a limited comic series, which is just fine.

860
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:00,480
It is... IDW Comics has announced a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles versus Street Fighter

861
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:08,240
comic crossover event. It's coming May of this year, and it's going to be penned by Paul Allor

862
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:15,280
with art by Ariel Mendel and colors by Sarah Meyers. It'll be a five-issue miniseries,

863
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:20,560
and it's going to have the turtles going toe-to-toe with Ryu, Ken, Chung-Li and Guile.

864
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:22,800
Neat.

865
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,840
I want a game now.

866
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,240
I know, right? That's where I'm at, is I'm like on it with the Ninja Turtles have had

867
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,200
several fighting games. I mean, all from...

868
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,000
Or like DLC for Street Fighter 6 or something like that.

869
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,280
Yeah, right? So why not? If they're not going to do another Tatsunoko versus Capcom or whatever,

870
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,280
why don't we get a TMNT versus Street Fighter? Why not? If we're not going to ever get Tekken

871
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,000
versus Street Fighter, well, we got one, we didn't get the other. We got Street Fighter

872
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,400
across Tekken, but we never got Tekken across Street Fighter. So why not give us Ninja Turtles?

873
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:55,280
Yeah.

874
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:01,280
I'm here for it. All right, let's talk about a warning, a reminder warning.

875
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,800
Oh, one thing. I would love for them to bring in the characters from

876
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,720
Tournament Fighter. Wouldn't that be cool?

877
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,760
I'm looking in chat for some comments too. DJ Roma S says,

878
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,240
I'm friends with Sarah Meyer. Her artwork is amazing. She does the ink work for TMNT

879
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:24,240
Saturday Morning Adventures. Oh, that's pretty cool. And of course, Tiger Claw,

880
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,040
I knew Tiger Claw would have something to say about this because I know he loves Ninja Turtles,

881
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:31,120
saying the TMNT in this comic crossover appears to be of the current continuity because we get

882
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:39,600
the fifth turtle, Jenica, on the cover. All right. Well, going over to some stories about Nintendo,

883
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,120
the Nintendo, what?

884
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:48,480
Sorry. I was going to say that is one of the best characters to be added into the TMNT continuity

885
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,680
because I was reading the comics pretty religiously for a while. Such a good character,

886
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,800
but I digress.

887
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,920
No, no worries. No worries. All right. Everybody got their Ninja Turtles out of their system? All

888
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:04,240
right. Let me talk about Nintendo changes that they're reminding you of. They've talked about

889
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:10,800
this before, but reminder, as of March 2023, so coming up next month at the end of the month,

890
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:17,360
you will no longer be able to buy Nintendo eShop purchases for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. You cannot

891
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:23,120
download free content. That means no more game demos. Also, related services will cease to

892
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,560
function. So some things have already stopped happening. So last year, they yanked the credit

893
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:36,400
card to add funds. They yanked it on the Wii U or 3DS, and then you couldn't use an eShop card

894
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:42,640
anymore at that point. If you link your Nintendo Network ID wallet with your Nintendo account,

895
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:48,400
you can use the shared balance to purchase on any of these systems until March, but after that,

896
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:54,480
they will only work on the Nintendo Switch. Further clarification, which is needed here.

897
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:03,520
The consolidation service, which allows you to merge your eShop balance between the Nintendo

898
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:10,480
account and the Switch eShop, doesn't work anymore after March 2024. So if you have any

899
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,240
money sitting on those systems, and now that I think about it, I wonder if I don't just have a

900
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:19,200
couple bucks floating in my wallet or whatever on one of these systems. I think I need to go check

901
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:25,360
just to make sure. I don't think so, but maybe on Wii U. I could see that maybe I had some points

902
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:31,760
left over or something there. But as of March 2024, you can't even combine the accounts

903
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,560
anymore. Why we had separate accounts for all this shit in the first place, I will never

904
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:43,520
understand. But I digress. After all, Microsoft and Sony have kept the same network ever since

905
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:52,800
the Xbox era. Xbox, 360, One. They've all used the same network, but I digress. Nintendo always

906
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,760
does things a little bit differently, don't they? But this is a good reminder. Check your Wii U

907
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:06,720
balances. Check all that stuff. Make sure they work. Mike Def says get that Pokemon bank and

908
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:12,400
transporter. If you ever want to pull your Pokemon off the DS, download that still while it's still

909
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:18,480
free before it doesn't work anymore. So great call out there for sure. Hopefully the bank will

910
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:22,240
continue to work even if the rest of Nintendo's online stuff doesn't. But I guess maybe because

911
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:27,120
that's all through the Pokemon company, they may operate that a little differently. So it'd be

912
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:34,080
interesting to see. All right. Well, let's go into our next segment to celebrate something

913
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:49,680
that hopefully will not be pulled in the year 2024. And now it's time to travel back to a

914
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:55,600
simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's

915
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:02,720
time for the Classic Game of the Week. All right, in Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

916
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:11,600
I picked After Burner Climax. And I love the music in this game.

917
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:16,000
Let me play a little bit of it in the background so our podcast folks can hear

918
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:22,800
as well as the live folks here. It's freaking After Burner. But at any rate,

919
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:31,280
After Burner Climax is another game in the After Burner series. It was released in arcades in 2006

920
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:39,920
and then had releases for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in April 2010. And you remember when we would go

921
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:48,640
to was it Mike's incredibly mediocre pizza? John's incredibly shitty pizza.

922
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,800
Yeah, that was it. Well, mediocre. There were some good ones.

923
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,160
I'm going to step away from keyboard for a minute while you finish saying it.

924
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:04,480
Well, at any rate, I would pretty much be lying toward this and Deadstorm Pirates.

925
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:13,520
So I love After Burner Climax. And, you know, just like the earlier incarnations of After Burner,

926
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:24,960
the Deluxe After Burner Climax cabinet had a servo cook chair that you could also use a button to

927
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:33,200
keep it locked in the static position. And it would like completely move around as you played

928
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:38,400
if you didn't use that. There were other cabinet versions that had a commander version, which tilts

929
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:43,280
side to side and the standard version that doesn't move at all. The deluxe cabinet had

930
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:51,840
a widescreen LCD monitor while the standard and commander had a 29 inch CRT. The digital version

931
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:57,200
actually has been delisted from Xbox Live and PlayStation tour as of December 2014

932
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,960
and was removed from all the storefronts in May 2015. There is a mobile version that was

933
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:09,760
re-released via the Sega Forever service in April 2019, but that's also gone.

934
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:18,960
At any rate, with After Burner Climax, it introduced two different aircraft,

935
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:28,720
the F-A-18E Super Hornet and the F-15E Strike Eagle. The original F-14 Tomcat that had been,

936
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:33,040
you know, the mainstay of the series was replaced with the F-14D Super Tomcat.

937
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:40,000
All of these are real planes, by the way, so I think that was cool. I think that they modeled

938
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:48,720
them really nicely. It's just, you know, my problem with After Burner is because of the way that

939
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:56,000
you're playing moves never felt really realistic. But at the same time, this game is, it's a lot

940
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,120
different when you're actually playing it on one of the deluxe caps. Anyway, when you choose your

941
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:07,120
plane, you can use the throttle to choose between four different paint jobs on your planes. You have

942
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:15,840
a standard, a camo, a special and a low visibility scheme. After you choose that, you can also choose

943
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:23,600
to listen to the After Burner Climax music or the original soundtrack from After Burner 2 by

944
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:31,600
holding the throttle back and hitting the missile button. I mean, it's really very, I'm gonna say,

945
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:37,600
you know, that the game, you know, is very straightforward. You know, you pew pew things.

946
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:42,400
It's got like a lock-in system on there. You can shoot your missiles. You've got a limited

947
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:52,720
number of your missiles, just like any, you know, fighter jet would. But it's so funny,

948
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:57,360
like the original After Burner, we had one at Scandia for a while. You remember?

949
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:05,920
I remember that. I do. I don't remember that, unfortunately. I used to get super motion sick

950
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:14,480
on it, but because it was the shifting circle kind of one. But the moving chair ones, I actually

951
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,600
never got so sick on. I used to play a lot of Starblade, remember? I only remember them having

952
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,640
the After Burner cabinet. It was either at Disneyland or at Great America. One of the

953
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:28,800
arcades had it. I think the Great America arcade that had that Galaxian 3 or whatever.

954
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:34,320
The last time I went to Great America, they had a Planet Harriers.

955
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:42,400
And you couldn't get me off of that machine. I was in love. But going back to After Burner Climax,

956
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:50,800
this was going on when there was this sort of renaissance for the classic SEGA titles.

957
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:58,160
So a little bit more behind this one. It was developed by SEGA AM2, you know, so it was the

958
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:11,840
big arcade group for SEGA. Art done by Aoki Seiji, programmed by Sumi Masayuki. It is

959
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:18,560
just a great game. I hate that all the home versions have been delisted.

960
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:29,040
Also, as far as the system it was released on, it was on the SEGA Lindbergh system

961
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:38,240
that used a 3 gigahertz Pentium 4 CPU, 1 gigabyte of RAM, and an NVIDIA GPU,

962
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:48,720
and an internal GPD ROM system. And this was the same one that Initial D arcade stage 4,

963
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:56,560
House of the Dead 4, Virtua Tennis 3, Virtua Fighter 5, and the cancelled Syfy.

964
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,160
So their current one, House of the Dead Scarlet Dawn, is on, I think this last one was an Unreal

965
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:14,560
4 based one. But at any rate, I mean, it's just sort of fun going back and seeing what these ran

966
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:23,920
on and, you know, seeing where the technology has come from. Because the one that came after

967
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:33,840
that was the Europa R that SEGA Rally 3 played on. But at any rate, it's just kind of neat seeing

968
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,880
how the technology has gone. Because this game, even today I would think, this game looks pretty

969
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,360
fantastic. Yeah, it's still a great looking game, especially with how fast it moves, right?

970
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:50,400
Reminds me of an F-Zero, but in the sky. Well, and you know where else the climax name has been

971
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:58,720
used was in Bayonetta. When the After Burner theme was the climax version,

972
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:05,360
there was, wasn't there also the one thing where you could switch her from

973
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:13,920
After Burner to a different shooter? Like if you had some outfit equipped?

974
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:19,520
I don't remember. Somebody in chat might speak up. Yeah, but my favorite thing though is that when

975
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:25,920
she, there was, I think it was also like a Space Harrier one for her, but I love how she says,

976
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:33,440
welcome to my fantasy zone. Yeah, yeah, it was Star Fox. That was the first switch.

977
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:40,400
If you had like the Fox McCloud outfit equipped, that when you played through that scene you'd

978
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:49,440
play as an Arwing. I didn't know that. It's neat. Yeah. But at any rate, it's a great game.

979
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:57,920
I still love to this day playing it in the arcade. So yeah, you know what I wish that they would have

980
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:04,400
done with me? I've done a fantasy zone climax. Well, it's never too late, right? There was the

981
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:09,920
SEGA ages re-releases, but I mean, heck I would, I'd have that in a heartbeat.

982
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:16,000
All right, there it is. SEGA, bring us Planet Harriers at home, the end.com.

983
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:23,200
Your classic of the week, After Burner Climax. Great arcade game that was very impressive and

984
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:28,400
yeah, really does still kind of hold up today. Bonds 006 says, this is the game that is the

985
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:34,480
reason I play Ace Combat. So, you know, people get started on the genre in one place and end up

986
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:40,080
playing other stuff. So awesome, awesome. All right, not everyone can be perfect. All right,

987
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:44,880
let's move on and travel around the world quickly with some rapid fire news and then we'll do some

988
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:50,160
release dates as well. But let's do rapid fire news first, Loki. Speaking of Ace Combat, if you

989
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:55,920
want to play that and you're a premium or extra subscriber of PlayStation Plus, you're going to

990
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,720
extra subscriber of PlayStation Plus, you can do that as part of their game catalog in February.

991
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:10,080
They're actually offering Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown for PlayStation 4. On PlayStation 5 and

992
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,960
PlayStation 4, Borderlands 3 is coming as well. One of my favorites, Earth Defense Force 5 for

993
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:22,160
PlayStation 4, The Forgotten City on PlayStation 5 and 4, Horizon Forbidden West on 5 and 4,

994
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:32,720
I Am Setsuna on PlayStation 4, Lost Sphear, Oninaki both on PlayStation 4, Outriders on PS4 and PS5,

995
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:40,160
The Quarry on both, Resident Evil 7 Biohazard on PlayStation 4, Scarlet Nexus on 5 and 4,

996
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:46,720
and Tekken 7 on 4. And then of the classic catalog, they're giving you Harvest Moon

997
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:52,080
Back to Nature, Legend of Dragoon and Wild Arms 2 on the original PlayStation.

998
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,920
I'm sorry, did someone say Legend of Dragoon?

999
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:55,840
Yes.

1000
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,200
That is an attention grabber.

1001
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:03,200
And then also PlayStation 4, Destroy All Humans. I'm assuming this is the remake

1002
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:10,000
that is part of the classic catalog there. And then this is a surprising bit of news,

1003
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,520
considering all of the delay news we hear, especially around Dead Island 2,

1004
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,880
but Dead Island 2 has gone gold. And in fact, they have moved up their release date one week

1005
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,000
to April 21st, 2023. So.

1006
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,920
Cool, it's coming. It'll be here soon. No more delays.

1007
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,560
Only like 10 years after the first game, but all right. I hope it's good.

1008
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,240
Better late than never, I guess.

1009
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,920
Yeah, hope it's good. Hope it's worth the wait.

1010
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,080
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1011
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:47,680
Oh, my artistic hero, the man himself, Amano Yoshitaka.

1012
01:37:50,080 --> 01:38:00,560
He is doing the cover for the DLC soundtracks that are coming with the first-run copies of

1013
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:06,560
Cuphead's Japanese physical edition. I was looking at the price. It's like 40 bucks,

1014
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,120
which isn't bad, but then the shipping is also 40 bucks, which is bad.

1015
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,920
And I want this so much. Oh, the artwork looks so good,

1016
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:25,440
but it's playing homage to the classic fantasy RPGs. It's absolutely beautiful artwork.

1017
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:32,480
There's been samples of it posted on the Twitters, but I love him.

1018
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:36,480
Yeah, it's really cute. For those that are watching on Twitch,

1019
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,440
we're trying to put some of that up on stream so you can kind of see what we're talking about.

1020
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:45,200
It is very impressive, obviously. Yeah, but I mean, keep in mind that

1021
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:53,680
it is because of this man that we have Power Rangers. Well, okay. He did the designs for

1022
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:59,040
Science Ninja Team Gatchaman when he was doing work for Tatunoko. He did the character designs

1023
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:07,920
for my favorite anime in the universe. And it was from that series that the idea for doing

1024
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:15,600
live-action Sentai came out. So we indirectly have him to thank for Power Rangers. But I mean,

1025
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:25,760
he also did an illustration for Vampire Hunter D novels and worked on Demon City Shinjuku. I mean,

1026
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:35,200
this guy and his other artwork is absolutely astounding. I have an art book this thick of

1027
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:43,520
his work. And I need every little single piece of his artwork I can get my grubby little fingers on.

1028
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:49,120
All right. Well, of course, obviously Amano is also very much known for his work with the

1029
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,120
Final Fantasy series. And we've been getting a lot of interesting Final Fantasy tidbits this year,

1030
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:58,000
not just with game releases like Theatrhythm and, you know, the upcoming Final Fantasy

1031
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:05,120
Pixel Remaster release on consoles. But we know that Final Fantasy 7 also supposedly getting the

1032
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:10,080
second chapter in the Rebirth series, or excuse me, the second chapter of the remake series

1033
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:14,640
Rebirth is also supposed to be this year. Square Enix has been sharing some insight to Final

1034
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:19,200
Fantasy 7's development, kind of talking a little bit about, you know, what maybe some of the

1035
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:23,840
original plans were for the game. I feel like we knew this, like this had been said in an interview

1036
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:29,040
before, but the development team did share that the original plan for Final Fantasy 7 was that

1037
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,800
the game was going to take place in New York City. I thought I remember something about some of that

1038
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:40,320
spinning off into what eventually became Parasite Eve, but I digress. So the game was originally

1039
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,640
going to take place in New York City. The story was a little bit different, but there were some

1040
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:49,600
elements that were the same. In the original story, Detective Joe, whoever that is, not Cloud,

1041
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:55,600
but Detective Joe was going to be investigating the group that was looking to destroy the Mako

1042
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:01,440
reactors. So that whole part, you know, with the Mako reactors and, you know, people wanting to

1043
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:06,960
blow it up for their reasons to save the planet, probably, like it was in the Final Fantasy 7 game,

1044
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,480
probably tied into the original 7. So interesting. One of the members in the group went through some

1045
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:19,520
different changes. That character eventually became Cloud Strife. So who knows? I mean,

1046
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,880
I don't know if Parasite Eve took more of that original idea. I don't know. I think maybe just

1047
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:29,440
maybe some of the graphics for New York, who knows? But it's kind of interesting that that's

1048
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:34,640
where Final Fantasy 7 started. And so if you were seeing parallels between Midgar and a big

1049
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:42,480
metropolis like New York City, you're not wrong. There's also that. So all right, let's check out

1050
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:47,120
some games that are coming out this week. I don't think we have the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but we

1051
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:50,400
have some other games that maybe you can look forward to this week. Loki.

1052
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:57,040
Yes, like Atomic Heart, which is going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

1053
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:06,240
Xbox Series. Like a Dragon, Isshin on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

1054
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:12,640
Seven Doors, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1055
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:20,640
Digimon World Next Order on PC and Nintendo Switch. Then it looks like we're getting into

1056
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:27,520
the PlayStation VR stuff. We have Horizon Call of the Mountain on PlayStation 5 or PlayStation VR 2

1057
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:37,920
actually. Kazuni AI, Touch of the Beat on PlayStation 5. Redemption Reapers on PC, Nintendo

1058
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:46,320
Switch and PlayStation 4. Blood Bowl 3 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox

1059
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:54,240
Series. Company of Heroes 3 on PC. Grimm Guardians, Demon Purge on PC, Nintendo Switch,

1060
01:42:54,240 --> 01:43:00,880
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. And then we have Raiden 3 Cross,

1061
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:09,520
Mikado Maniacs on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1062
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,120
Cliven Wrench That came close to importing that one.

1063
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,320
Matt

1064
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,000
What's Mikado Maniacs?

1065
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,120
Danielle Mikado is a music studio.

1066
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,040
Matt Hmm, that'd be cool.

1067
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,440
Danielle And it's supposed to have a pretty killer soundtrack. I mean,

1068
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,720
Raiden 3 was pretty mediocre as far as the Raiden games go.

1069
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:34,160
But the Mikado studio has done some amazing music.

1070
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:39,680
Matt Cliven Wrench on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1071
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:49,240
and we've got a couple more here. Kirby's Return to Dreamland deluxe on Nintendo Switch and last

1072
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:56,960
but not least Octopath Traveler 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. That's it.

1073
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,760
All right, let's travel over to Japan. I feel like we've had some light release weeks in Japan

1074
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:06,080
lately. This week, very much not the case. We have a lot of shit coming out in Japan this week. So,

1075
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:12,000
pull up a chair. Here we go on the Nintendo Switch. Oita Beppu Mystery Guide, the Warped Bamboo

1076
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,640
Lantern is out on the switch this week. The Ultimate Wonder Boy Collection. I was looking at

1077
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,560
this because I was wondering if it was just another rerelease of the Dragon's Trap and it is,

1078
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:25,760
but there's it has Wonder Boy, Wonder Boy Monster Land, Dragon's Trap, Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair,

1079
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:31,840
Wonder Boy 5, Wonder Boy 4, or excuse me, Monster World 4 is in there too. It's very, very busy with

1080
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:38,160
Wonder Boy games. So if you are a fan of that series, there's that for you. Digimon World Next

1081
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:45,200
Order has its release, the international edition in Japan this week as well. Akatsuki Yureyu Koi

1082
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:50,400
Akari is out in a regular and limited edition this week. Sakura Moyu as the Knight's

1083
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:54,920
Reincarnation is out in a regular and limited edition this week as well on the switch. Koi

1084
01:44:54,920 --> 01:45:03,560
Suro Kanojo Nu No Bukkyo Na Butai is out in a regular and limited edition this week in Japan.

1085
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:13,080
Yep. Omoide Kakaete Ai No Koi is out this week as well in a regular and

1086
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:13,840
I'm like a dating sim.

1087
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:17,120
And audience, limited edition. Yes, it is.

1088
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,520
I'm gonna keep guessing.

1089
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:26,080
Okay, let's see. Other games we have the Crimson Flower That Divides Us Lunar Coupling is out in

1090
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:37,120
Japan on the 23rd. That same Raiden 3 Cross Mikado Maniacs is out. Hakuoki Remeroku is out as well

1091
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:44,240
this week in Japan. And of course, Octopath Traveler 2 does get a Japanese release. And of

1092
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,320
course that Kirby game also getting released in Japan as well. And if you were waiting for this

1093
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:54,200
on the switch in Japan, guess what? You can finally play Ark Survival Evolved in a physical

1094
01:45:54,200 --> 01:46:02,560
edition on this switch this week in Japan. How about the PlayStation 5 now? The PlayStation VR 2

1095
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:06,480
is released this week. That is worth noting. So if you want to pick that up, and then that would

1096
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:10,440
mean a lot of the stuff that comes with it, including the Horizon Call the Mountain, the

1097
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:16,200
charging station. That same Raiden 3 crossover game is also out on the PlayStation 5 if you'd

1098
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:21,880
rather play it there. Tortuga A Pirate's Tale also out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.

1099
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:28,680
Octopath Traveler 2 also out on the PlayStation 5. What did I tell you? A busy week. How about the UK?

1100
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:39,680
Well, on the 21st, we have Like a Dragon Isshin. That's for PlayStation and Xbox. Likewise, we have

1101
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:49,480
Atomic Heart. On the 22nd for Switch, we have Digimon World Next Order. On the 23rd, for the

1102
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:58,160
big three consoles, we have Blood Bowl 3 Brutal Edition. For PC, Company of Heroes 3 for PlayStation

1103
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:06,520
and Switch, My Life Pet Vet. Moving on to the 24th, we have Do Not Open for PlayStation for

1104
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:15,880

1105
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:23,960
have Broken Pieces, PlayStation Xbox, Hunt Showdown, Limited Bounty Hunter Edition. For Switch

1106

1108
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:47,320
and Wrench, and that's it for the week. All right, we have a few more stories, then we're going to get

1109
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:52,600
to the listener roundtable. We do have an email tonight, finally bucking the trend of the past,

1110
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:58,920
what, two months. So that's exciting. Spirit Gasp here. So we'll also get to your comments and maybe

1111
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:04,760
your phone calls if we have time as well over on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1112
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:08,600
But first, we have a few more stories for you. Let's go back to Loki.

1113
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:15,960
So we talked last week how there's going to be this big update for Team Fortress 2. Well,

1114
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:21,400
apparently they've started to walk back the expectations for that. So they've changed

1115
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:28,360
a little bit of the passage that was in their update. So it previously read, you know, the last

1116
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:34,760
few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates, but this year we're playing a full

1117
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:41,240
on update size update with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and who knows what

1118
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:48,600
else, which means we need Steam Workshop content, your Steam Workshop content. And now it says,

1119
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:52,520
you know, the last Team Fortress summer updates have only been item updates, but this year we're

1120
01:48:52,520 --> 01:49:00,360
playing a full on holiday sized update. I don't know what that means as far as different. With

1121
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,480
items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and other community contributed fixes for the

1122
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:12,760
game, which means we need your Steam Workshop content, your Steam Workshop content, which

1123
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:19,960
I mean, originally it sounded like that, you know, they were incorporating Steam Workshop stuff into

1124
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:24,120
the game update, but now it's like, no, it's only going to be Steam Workshop content.

1125
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:29,080
We were just gathering and putting it out as a free update, even though you've made all the

1126
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:39,960
stuff for it. Oh, well. It's a really old game. Like, I don't expect them to be publishing more

1127
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:44,520
stuff for it. We could just make a Team Fortress 3 if y'all weren't allergic to the number three.

1128
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,440
I can't do that.

1129
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:49,480
Snow three evolve.

1130
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:55,640
Speaking of allergies, I am definitely allergic to this trend in the gaming community, DarkSakura.

1131
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:03,640
Squenix is not learning anything. They're not listening to people and they're not learning.

1132
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:10,280
They announced very recently that they are launching their NFT based game,

1133
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:20,200
Symbiogenesis, Symbiogenesis on a site called Polygon, which is an Ethereum scaling network.

1134
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:27,000
It was announced last November. And then, and back then they said that story driven collectibles

1135
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:34,280
were of course at the heart of it and that they plan to launch on Ethereum. But now they say

1136
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:40,680
they're using Polygon instead that uses a side chain to basically deal in faster and cheaper

1137
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:47,160
transactions than the Ethereum's network, well, their own main net can handle. They

1138
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:56,040
were also interested in the lower fees in general, going back to make it a little bit cheaper.

1139
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:03,560
And they wanted to offer what they call a unique experience to Web3

1140
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:09,000
fans. This is stated by the game producer Tamate Nalyuki.

1141
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:18,440
They put some more details out. It's going to be built around 10,000 character NFTs that are tied

1142
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:23,960
to game mechanics. Although there are other entities used in the game, according to their

1143
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:29,080
document that they released to Polygon Labs, owning a character NFT is not required to play

1144
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:36,440
the game, although it adds unspecified extra value to the experience. Character NFT holders

1145
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:42,520
can create replica NFTs to share story information with other characters. The game will be taking

1146
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:50,200
a place on a floating continent above a polluted future earth with a society forced to band

1147
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:58,920
together to keep a dragon away from their floating home. It is turn-based gameplay tied to the

1148
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:07,800
storyline. Different paths go with different missions and either holding or trading NFTs.

1149
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:13,400
They showed some of the NFT items that included dragon tarot cards and the monster storybook.

1150
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:20,520
There's no more actual details out. But I can tell you, I'm...

1151
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:32,040
No. And they've been investing in this Ethereum sandbox and they also announced that they were

1152
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:38,920
going to revive Dungeon Siege, the franchise. That better not be coming out as an NFT thing.

1153
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,480
Dungeon Siege wasn't bad, but if it's all going to be NFT crap, then forget it.

1154
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:47,880
Wasn't their last version of the Dungeon Siege game that they did was Awful 2?

1155
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,600
Dungeon Siege 3? I didn't think it was that bad.

1156
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:55,560
No, I'm thinking of a different game. I'm thinking of Dungeon Keeper.

1157
01:52:55,560 --> 01:53:00,760
Oh, yeah. So here's the question I have about this game. Let's take a look at another Square

1158
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:05,160
Enix title real quick. I want to know, does the NFT game, what's it called? Symbiogenesis?

1159
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:08,120
Does Symbiogenesis last...

1160
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:09,000
Be a genus.

1161
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:16,920
Sorry. Whatever it's called. Does it last longer or shorter than Babylon's Fall?

1162
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:21,960
For the record, which by the way, this is a timely question because in case you forgot,

1163
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:30,600
Babylon's Fall was released on March 3rd, 2022. The servers are being shut down on Thursday,

1164
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:38,120
February 23rd. So this is actually timely. R.I.P. Babylon's Fall. Literal P. Rest in it.

1165
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:49,800
So Babylon's Fall lasted 51 weeks. Does Symbiogenesis go,

1166
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:55,480
we're going to play Price is Right, higher than or lower than 51 weeks?

1167
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:57,320
Lower.

1168
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:05,320
Well, there's another thing, too, that people need to keep in mind. So in last May's,

1169
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:12,600
Gwenix sold off a bunch of their studios and franchises, including Tomb Raider. And they used

1170
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:21,480
the roughly 300 million that they got to start supporting this Web3 experience as far, and also

1171
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:29,320
some other business ventures. So if this flops the way we think it will, Gwenix is going to be

1172
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,920
not just in P, they're going to be in deep shit.

1173
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:37,480
This is why I made the prediction I did at the beginning of the year that the current CEO of

1174
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:44,040
Square Enix is not going to make it through the year as CEO. And this is another fantastic

1175
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:49,080
example because when this game is an embarrassment and ends up lasting less than 51 weeks, which is

1176
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:58,200
where I'm going to hedge my bet, it's over. Questbuster in chat says, Rob not pulling any

1177
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:02,600
punches. You know what? I don't have time for NFTs and neither does anyone else.

1178
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:03,960
We're too old for this shit.

1179
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:08,520
Yeah, exactly. I'm too old for this shit. And yeah, that's money that could have gone

1180
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:14,280
towards the development of putting more theater rhythm songs into theater the final bar line.

1181
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,120
Bro, don't even.

1182
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:17,720
All right.

1183
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:23,720
Oh my God. They could have used that money to license Angela Aki. I'm just saying.

1184
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:29,400
You know what's not in theater the final bar line? Babylon's fall.

1185
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:30,600
My butt.

1186
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,640
All right. Loki, what do you have for us?

1187
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:45,240
Yes, it's another person being fired for sexual misconduct allegations. So Genshin Impact voice

1188
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:55,480
actor Elliot Gindi is no longer going to be voicing, I guess, Tignari because apparently,

1189
01:55:55,480 --> 01:56:00,360
you know, they said after communications with voice recording agency, we hereby confirm that

1190
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:06,760
Elliot Gindi and the English voice actor for Tignari will no longer be voicing the character

1191
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:12,680
in subsequent versions due to breach of contract. I guess that contract is, you know, sexual

1192
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:18,840
allegations. Yeah, President, we are communicating with the voice recording agency regarding the

1193
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:25,720
matter and casting a rerecording will gradually replace a Tignari's existing in game voice lines

1194
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:30,360
and issue these updates in a corresponding announcement. Thank you for your support.

1195
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,040
So he's being removed, removed.

1196
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,800
Yeah, there's that one. I remember the other game was that they were doing that with too.

1197
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,960
They recast and redid all the voice lines.

1198
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:47,000
Destiny 2. Remember, the guy from Game of Thrones used to be the little AI thing.

1199
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,960
And they know it wasn't the same reason, but they did do that.

1200
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:58,600
No, there was another one that was actually for this type of thing. I think. I want to say it was

1201
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:06,360
in like a dragon, but I don't remember. I don't remember or one of the Yakuza games. I don't

1202
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:12,760
remember now. I don't remember. I remember. Yeah, it's annoying to still see, you know,

1203
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:17,560
this type of thing happening in the industry, but they're addressing it.

1204
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:22,120
Quest Buster does point out miHoYo did the same thing with another character in 2021. This might

1205
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:26,520
be why this sounds familiar, but it was when a Chinese voice actor was erased for similar

1206
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:33,800
behavior while he was married, by the way. So, Dr. Sia says judgment the Yakuza spinoff game.

1207
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,480
That's what it was.

1208
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:39,000
Yeah. Yeah. Now that I think about it, I do remember a story about that, too,

1209
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,640
had something like that. That's right. It sure did. The actor got busted for drugs,

1210
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:48,120
so they had to replace him because that's what it was. It's a huge, huge issue in

1211
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:56,920
certain countries. So, yeah. Interesting. All right. And then DGRMS about this particular

1212
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:01,560
article says this guy is from my neck of the woods. Fuck that guy. The whole Elliott

1213
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:08,920
Gindi drama goes very deep. That's all I will say. All right. Well, another chat that was said

1214
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:13,880
earlier in chat was SG100Matt saying it all comes back to Theatrhythm. And it sure does,

1215
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:20,600
because guess what I have for the last story tonight? Theatrhythm rumors, but with substance

1216
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:27,080
to it, because it's a quote that was said. There's some press interviews going on with

1217
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:33,240
producer Ichiro Hazama and director Masanobu Suzui, who are promoting Theatrhythm in the

1218
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:37,880
various gaming press right now. But they are taking questions about what could be in the

1219
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:44,760
future for the series. And the team has actually said they'd love to work with franchises like

1220
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:51,880
Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem, and Pokemon. The developers would like to work with

1221
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:56,280
Nintendo on the installment, and there's certainly the music there to do it. I mean, all they would

1222
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:00,600
have to do is like a Theatrhythm Super Smash Brothers, because I think about like how Super

1223
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:05,720
Smash Brothers has the players in it that the audio players that have a very rich Nintendo

1224
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:13,000
soundtrack in them. So to this entire story, I really just say please. What I thought was

1225
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,880
interesting is that in a comment to this story on Go Nintendo, I thought this was an interesting

1226
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:24,200
take on it a comment I hear I don't usually read the comments. But here is like the one time in

1227
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:30,040
internet history where I found the comment interesting. And the user said, as neat as the

1228
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:36,600
Square Nintendo crossover rhythm game can be, Nintendo can just revive elite beat agents,

1229
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:41,240
or make a spin off of EBA that focuses on Nintendo music only. Like you can play along to

1230
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:44,760
a Mario theme and in the background, there could be a mini story of Mario rescuing Peach from

1231
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:49,560
browser again, and etc. So basically, this commenter is saying, you know, Nintendo could

1232
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:53,240
just kind of take the idea and make it their own because it wasn't that dissimilar in the first

1233
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:57,240
place from what elite beat agents was. I thought that was an interesting take on it.

1234
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,520
They can have the art style be like Paper Mario.

1235
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:05,480
Yeah. Mike Defton chat says, give me pokey rhythm, please. You know what's interesting?

1236
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:13,560
If I recall right, was it I don't think it was the Pokemon company, but it was maybe it was the

1237
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:19,640
Pokemon company. There was that game Harmonite that was made by the people that make Pokemon.

1238
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:25,320
It was very different type of game. But that was on the 3DS. It hadn't I mean, it was removed from

1239
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,520
Pokemon. I didn't actually have the music in it or anything. But it was like a music game. It's just

1240
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:32,920
something that comes to mind when you kind of bring up the pokey rhythm. So is that Harmonite

1241
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:40,040
was the thing. So d'Artussia says I definitely do the Zelda course first. Yeah. And, you know,

1242
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:45,160
Crypt of the NecroDancer is the thing. So it's not like Nintendo is closed off to letting other

1243
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:52,280
companies have their IPs in interesting ways. So that could be very interesting. Jason says,

1244
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:57,640
Thea Trithym is the intro read and the last story lol. The way it ought to be tbh. Oh,

1245
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:02,520
and Deft confirms Harmonite did have Pokemon music in it. Oh, I stand corrected. Perfect.

1246
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:09,800
All right. Let's get to the listener roundtable. We invite your participation every week via chat.

1247
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:14,520
If you have a question for us in chat, via Discord, which you can join our Discord over

1248
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:20,920
at vog at network.com slash discord, and our email bag so you can go to participate at orange

1249
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:27,480
laundry do calm if you want to send us an email, which someone finally did this week. Let's get to

1250
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:34,040
the email because it's gonna be an interesting one. It's a doozy. It's a doozy. So let's get

1251
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:41,320
this is a topic. Well, I'll, I'll say my thoughts once Jamie's read it. And I'm permitting this one

1252
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:47,880
because of the nature of the discussion that it will provoke. So hello, or after witnessing some

1253
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:54,920
fallout yesterday from a Final Fantasy 14 streamer trying out Hogwarts legacy. I wanted to ask you

1254
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:59,160
all how you feel about the situation where anyone who streams the game gets a swarm of people

1255
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:05,800
harassing them over it. First off, I 100% support those who refuse to purchase the game or watch any

1256
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:11,400
content from it. She who will not be named is a scummy individual to put it lightly.

1257
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:17,320
Now it seems that anyone who has any Harry Potter fondness or plays this game is immediately labeled

1258
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:23,400
as hateful, a bigot or transphobic. I grew up reading slash watching Harry Potter, and have

1259
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:29,640
been curious about the game haven't bought it. But as someone who was the victim of harassment

1260
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:35,240
to the point of where I almost made an irreversible decision, it's really hard for me

1261
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:41,320
to stand by and say that this retaliation is okay. trans people from around the world have had to

1262
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:49,000
endure harassment their entire lives. I understand that. But this isn't but but this isn't right to

1263
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:55,160
fight hate with hate and risk what that we lose others. I know Jamie said that she didn't want

1264
02:02:55,160 --> 02:03:00,600
to cover anything Hogwarts legacy related on the show. So if you choose to bypass this email,

1265
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:06,120
I understand. I just wanted to express my concerns in the only way I can and that Twitter

1266
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:13,400
sure as shit isn't going to allow. Love you guys. Garth Wolf. Yeah, um,

1267
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:18,040
I've thought long and hard about this one. Um,

1268
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:28,760
because I only have one friend, one person that I have retained followship of, who was playing this

1269
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:38,760
game. And the biggest thing that I see is that, well, first of all, I've been seeing a lot of just

1270
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:51,320
really terrible. I would say conservative people using this game to express their anti trans

1271
02:03:51,320 --> 02:04:00,120
sentiment. I am including that particular voice actor, who, while I love his voice,

1272
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:07,160
and I love a certain character that he voiced, he is a piece of shit human. And he is friends

1273
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:18,280
with the other piece of shit human. I loved the franchise. It came out at a really difficult time

1274
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:25,480
in my life. I actually still have my books. I'm sorry, I imported my books. And I spent a lot of

1275
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:32,360
money on them. And I'm not one to throw away literature or anything really if I spent money

1276
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:36,840
on it because the money was already spent before I knew anything. That being said,

1277
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:45,400
I am not buying the game. I haven't bought any, the very last thing I ever bought was a Slytherin

1278
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:53,960
mug, like years ago. And that's the last time I've bought anything. But it doesn't mean that I don't

1279
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:59,240
love the stories that we're told. I don't love the characters. I mean, I'm gonna say it. She's

1280
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:05,240
a great author. She wrote really good stuff. And, and there are lots of parallels that people have

1281
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:11,400
seen, that links back to their own experience as a marginalized or misunderstood person.

1282
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:19,800
You know, but then when you go and you see the motivation that this person has, and how

1283
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:27,240
a lot of this has been sneaking into her later work on top of it, it just, it's completely

1284
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:33,800
soured it for me. It doesn't mean that I don't, you know, love and identify with the stories and

1285
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:40,680
characters, but it also means that there's a part of it that's been very tarnished for me.

1286
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:47,160
And the only way that, you know, a person in my position can really do something about it is to,

1287
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:54,600
number one, speak out. Number two, vote with my dollars. I still won't go to Universal.

1288
02:05:55,240 --> 02:06:00,920
I won't go to the Nintendo thing at Universal because it's contributing money back to her

1289
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:07,000
franchise because I'm sure as we know that when you pay for franchising, you're, you're paying

1290
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,560
like a flat rate to maintain that license. I didn't mean franchising, I meant licensing.

1291
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:18,200
So it's not like I think she's getting like active royalties every time a ticket is sold.

1292
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:25,560
I think she's already been paid and she's going to get paid again. So going back to this,

1293
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:35,320
as far as the harassment side of everything goes, there's a fair point that Garth made that our

1294
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:41,960
trans friends have been living with this sort of hateful discrimination their entire lives. And

1295
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:50,680
I'm even throwing in the internalized transphobia that society has inflicted upon them and taught

1296
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:57,560
them that how they feel is wrong, that you're just confused or, you know, and anything for anyone on

1297
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:07,560
the queer spectrum, you know. I've had it as an ace person. I know we've all experienced this

1298
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:16,840
sense about ourselves when something doesn't conform to the default of, you know, what our

1299
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:30,760
current society has inflicted upon us. But as far as going in to someone else's chat room

1300
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:39,000
while they're streaming the game and being nasty and being abusive,

1301
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:45,800
I have learned, if anything, this is just going to make somebody double down more

1302
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:49,800
and it's going to close them off from a willingness to be educated about it.

1303
02:07:50,120 --> 02:08:04,760
I prefer that, especially if it's a friend of mine, you know, like this particular friend,

1304
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:11,720
I happened to be in DBD chat when the discussion came up and I flat out said,

1305
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:18,600
I love you. I will not watch when you play this game. I will not give any revenue,

1306
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:25,640
any, you know, I have Twitch turbos besides appointments. I wouldn't, you know,

1307
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:32,280
watch any ads during that time. I would not participate in the stream. I would actively

1308
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:38,840
not participate. And she's like, I get it. And she's like, I get why people

1309
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:46,920
are acting this way while people, you know, feel this about the game. I don't know that

1310
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:56,680
this person 100% understands that point of view. And I've tried to be as gently

1311
02:08:56,680 --> 02:09:04,680
educational about it as I can, but I also feel that in this, the way things are, and this is

1312
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:13,960
not just dealing with our trans friends or LGBTQ plus issues or, or, you know, even issues of,

1313
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:20,440
of race, you know, people of color having to explain why something is considered racist

1314
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:26,200
or something like that, that you also have to have a willingness to go out and be educated.

1315
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:34,440
You know, you can't put the burden of education on somebody who is in that group.

1316
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:39,320
You know, you shouldn't make them do the emotional labor

1317
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:47,160
of having to be the one to educate you. I guarantee you, if you talk to any person of

1318
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:54,680
color in this universe, they're going to tell you it's exhausting having to explain and defend

1319
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:03,480
themselves, their existence because of other people's willful ignorance, and that they want

1320
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:08,360
them to explain it to them rather than this person giving enough of a shit to go out and

1321
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:14,360
look for the answer themselves. And that's how I feel about people streaming the game who claim

1322
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:21,480
to be an ally and still don't understand when you explain it to them. It's, it's,

1323
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:34,760
you know what I mean? I'm just letting you have your space. I'm really trying to be succinct

1324
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:40,360
about it. I do not think we should go in and harass other people TLDR, you know, yeah.

1325
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:48,600
I think that you can take your friend aside, and you can explain to them and you can give

1326
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:55,560
them resources and let them educate themselves. And pay attention to the things that they say

1327
02:10:55,560 --> 02:11:03,720
about it. Are they repeating what other people have said? Do they have their own reasons for it?

1328
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:15,240
Um, are they doing it from a place of hate? You know, I even look at this for a lot of people

1329
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:23,640
who claim allyship but are still playing the game that it's, it's like one of those as they

1330
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:29,640
quote micro transgressions, that they don't realize the harm that they're doing, and they're not

1331
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:38,280
doing it in a spirit of ill will, but they do not understand. And in some cases, there's people who

1332
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:43,560
are not capable of understanding that experience. They don't live it. I tried to, I tell my mother

1333
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:49,160
regularly, you know, like when I was talking about like, I forgot what I was talking about,

1334
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:52,280
but my mom said, well, I've never had that happen. I was like, you are not other people,

1335
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:55,240
just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it hasn't happened to other people.

1336
02:11:56,040 --> 02:12:03,560
Your experiences are yours. Their experiences are theirs. And I think that you have to

1337
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:11,800
be willing to be vulnerable. You have to really be willing to be vulnerable and be willing to be

1338
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:21,160
wrong in something that you hold as an intrinsic core belief. You have to be willing to be hurt

1339
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:30,520
by it, to grow as a person, to be educated and learn why what you're doing has a greater impact

1340
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:36,760
than just having fun with a video game. Cause I can guarantee you a few of my, my trans friends

1341
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:43,000
that I've spoken to on this one have lost friendships over this game because, and I will

1342
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:51,320
paraphrase, my friend is saying your friendship with me to you is not more important than this

1343
02:12:51,320 --> 02:13:00,600
game. This game is more important to you than I am as a person. So that's my piece for now.

1344
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,320
I'm going to eat some pizza. No, you're fine. I'm going to be honest. When I originally saw

1345
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:08,120
the email, I didn't want to talk about it because I feel like I don't want to give that game any

1346
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:13,480
more attention. This game has already gotten way too much attention. This boycott has absolutely

1347
02:13:13,480 --> 02:13:19,800
positively completely backfired. And if you don't like me for saying that too fucking bad. The proof

1348
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:26,760
is in the numbers. It's selling like wild. It's the number one watched game on Twitch. And I would

1349
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:33,400
say the boycott has only fanned the flames of that whole thing. Let me be clear. My own viewpoint on

1350
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:38,600
Hogwarts legacy. I'm treating it like a sports game. I don't like there, there can be a great

1351
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:43,160
video game out there. I don't fucking care to play it. And I don't fucking care to play it because of

1352
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:47,560
the shit that's come out of her mouth. And I've been disconnected from this universe for quite

1353
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:53,560
some time. I think I've seen a couple of the movies, but like, that's it on the, so, so yeah,

1354
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:58,920
I understand why, why people are upset and why, you know, this game and so forth. That being said,

1355
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:04,040
I also understand that hurt people hurt people. And I understand why some of this is getting very

1356
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:09,000
ugly because like it was said in the, in the email, trans people have had to put up with a

1357
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:15,160
lot of bullshit over the years. And so, yeah, when feelings get hurt, sometimes that turns around

1358
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:21,960
into hurting other people. But that being said, and I think Jamie really already touched on a lot

1359
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:26,200
of this. I'm really just echoing a lot of what you just said. You don't know somebody else's

1360
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:33,560
backstory. You don't know what they might be capable of when it comes to separating

1361
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:41,320
Harry Potter as a fictional universe from the creator. What I mean by that is when you go in,

1362
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:45,480
and I'm not, I'm saying you, but I'm just saying not, not you the listener, but you the bully out

1363
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:49,480
there that probably isn't listening. When the bully goes into somebody's chat deciding, I'm

1364
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:55,400
going to bully this person for playing this game. Have you ever thought that maybe the person that's

1365
02:14:55,400 --> 02:15:01,800
playing the game is playing the game because Harry Potter was something that they read to

1366
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:09,720
when they were trying to escape an abusive family situation. When mom and dad were fighting in the

1367
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:17,240
other room, and there were physical exchanges happening. And somebody went in to lock themselves

1368
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:22,280
in their bedroom and read Harry Potter because that was their escape. You don't know if that's

1369
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:32,760
somebody else's story. And so the answer is to bully that individual into coming over to your

1370
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:38,840
side. I'm sorry, that's absolutely not going to work. You're going to cause them to double down

1371
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:43,240
and dig their heels in and you're going to make the problem worse, which is what has happened in

1372
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:50,200
this case. And the saying holds true, you catch more more flies with with honey than vinegar.

1373
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:54,440
Yeah, and but I'm sick of, you know, the unfortunately, when I see these perspectives

1374
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:59,400
presented about we should educate and we should do these different things that is usually met with,

1375
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:03,560
well, you're privileged, and you're in a privileged position to be able to do that.

1376
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:08,520
But you can also both things can be true. I could recognize, yes, I'm in a privileged position,

1377
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:13,400
but I can also recognize but guess what, this tactic you're using over here isn't working,

1378
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:19,800
and you're going to be able to win more people to your side if you educate people. And that is what

1379
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:23,880
I do. When people say they're going to stream Hogwarts Legacy, I say great, I'm not going to

1380
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:28,280
be watching. I have no interest in that game. That woman turned me off to that game several

1381
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:34,840
years ago and that entire universe. I have no interest in that franchise. There are 20 other

1382
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:40,120
games that came out this month that we ought to be talking about. And we're still talking about this.

1383
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:46,040
And the other thing too, you know, we were bringing up privilege and I was bringing up

1384
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:55,720
putting the emotional labor on the, quote, afflicted party. We who were in a privileged

1385
02:16:55,720 --> 02:17:05,960
position to be an ally, who have, you know, at least this semblance of fitting into some

1386
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:13,320
accepted stereotype, we can use our privilege and it's encouraged, I think, for us to do so to

1387
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:22,600
offer that point more in the way of pointing to resources put out by people in the marginalized

1388
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:30,600
groups. For example, and even me as an autistic person, I have submitted many things to my

1389
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:35,800
corporate work that's actually had our training changed. Like for an example, they were all like

1390
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:41,800
doing that person first, so person with autism, when the majority of us don't go by that. We go

1391
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:48,360
by autistic person and find the other thing insulting. And now the material says, ask what

1392
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:58,200
someone prefers. But I think that also, as I am not a psychologist, I mean, I have a lot of

1393
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:04,600
interest in psychology and I've learned quite a bit about it, but I'm not a psychologist and I

1394
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:10,760
can't tell you that this is the true effect of someone's mindset or their neurology or whatnot.

1395
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:17,800
Just like, I mean, I spent a lot of time in the sociology courses, but I'm not a sociologist. I

1396
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:24,680
don't know how it affects society in this point, for example. You have to know resources that you

1397
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:31,320
can direct people to because you cannot expect the person in the group to continue to provide

1398
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:38,600
that emotional labor and consistent, I would even say, reopening of wounds by having to speak about

1399
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:46,760
it ad nauseam. It's up to us to be a good ally for the groups, the marginalized groups that we

1400
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:54,040
do, are not an active part of and provide the material that has been approved, that has been

1401
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:59,080
called good. The same way I say, do not refer people to Autism Speaks. They're a hate group.

1402
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:04,360
ASAN is a lot better. The same thing, we have to learn those resources from the people that

1403
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:08,920
are in the groups to find out what's accepted and what really puts the point across. And we

1404
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:16,520
have to make sure that we put this information out there. And be willing to speak up when we see

1405
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:29,880
injustice done. Silence is complicity, is exactly how I see it. And indirect participation

1406
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:40,680
is also an act of complicity. So I choose not to be complicit in the things that are antithesis

1407
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:47,320
to my belief system. And I believe that a transgender woman is a woman. I believe a

1408
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:52,520
transgender man is a man. I believe that a non-binary person is legitimately non-binary,

1409
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:57,720
no matter what's in their knickers. Yes, I use a very southern word for underwear.

1410
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:09,480
I think that people who get their panties all in a bunch over other people just wanting the same

1411
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:18,120
rights as other people, honestly enough, I would like to see their roles reversed. I would love,

1412
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:23,880
I mean, and it's, you know, literature has tried to do this before. Like, for example,

1413
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,760
there was an old Superman comic where Lois Lane was black for a day.

1414
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:36,440
It's very controversial, but there are some times where I desperately wish that I could take a

1415
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:43,800
bigot and have them live a day in the life of one of the people they hate.

1416
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:53,640
And see what they're standing against and how ridiculously dangerous it is.

1417
02:20:54,600 --> 02:21:00,680
I think, for me, too, the thing that is, if I can point my finger at what upsets me most about

1418
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:10,040
J. Karen Rowling and her viewpoints. Obviously, I find her viewpoints gross. But what really-

1419
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:11,320
Let's just call her Karen.

1420
02:21:11,320 --> 02:21:16,520
What really sealed it for me was the fact that one of the pro-LGBT

1421
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:22,280
agencies, I want to say it was PFLAG, but I might be wrong. It might be a different,

1422
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:28,680
GLAAD, it might be a different advocacy organization. They offered to talk to her,

1423
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:35,800
sit her down one on one, educate her in a respectful environment and let her know why

1424
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:41,160
her words are hurtful. She turned them down. And that's where I have the problem is that

1425
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:46,280
somebody who refuses to be educated and refuses to even listen, that's a problem.

1426
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:54,040
I kind of go back to some things I said on the show a couple of weeks ago, and that is,

1427
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:56,600
I think it was the week you weren't here, Jamie, though, actually. But it was,

1428
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:02,040
fuck you, you fucking fuck has never won an argument. Never, ever in the history of ever

1429
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:06,280
has that won an argument. I quite frankly, some of this bullying and this stuff that's happening,

1430
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:10,200
I find it to be quite performative. I'm just going to say it. It's a performance.

1431
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:15,800
It's- I think a lot of it comes from a place where somebody, instead of doing actual hard

1432
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:22,760
work to educate, they want to do a performance to show everybody, look, I'm such an ally,

1433
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:30,280
I'm going to bully these people into submission. I'm sorry. That's disgusting. Wake up.

1434
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:35,560
That reminds me actually of a former mutual friend of both of ours.

1435
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:37,880
Yeah, I know. I know. But-

1436
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:40,120
But it really is performative.

1437
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:44,440
It is. And the part that gets me, and this all comes back to the whole,

1438
02:22:44,440 --> 02:22:49,480
there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. And I know some people don't want to apply that

1439
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:54,680
to this argument. I'm sorry. There's too many people that want to say, oh, well, it's not this

1440
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:01,000
because of this. It's not, you know, I'm sorry. You don't get to draw the fucking borders just

1441
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:09,880
so that it works for you. And my case and point is the Twitter bullying. What the actual fuck

1442
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:20,200
are you doing, you fucking hypocrite? And the excuses I have seen people use. Oh, well,

1443
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:25,080
Twitter is a public forum, so it's different and we owe it to ourselves to be here to-

1444
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:35,160
What? Twitter is not a public forum. It is not a publicly traded company. It is a private forum

1445
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:41,880
owned by one person who wants it to be the town square. But I ask you, do his actions

1446
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:46,520
that shove his tweets in your face, whether you want to or not, unless you blocked his ass,

1447
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:53,240
is that representative of what the town square ought to look like? By the way, a same individual

1448
02:23:53,240 --> 02:24:00,440
who wrote a tweet that said, and I quote, my pronouns are prosecute slash Fauci. You will

1449
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:06,680
turn a blind eye to that, to use that person's platform that generates those ad dollars to yell

1450
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:12,440
at your streamer that is streaming Hogwarts legacy. Now, again, I don't want to make it

1451
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:18,440
sound like this whole like, no, it is you who are the bully and this whole thing. I'm not saying

1452
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:22,040
that I love the fact that this game is getting all this attention and that, you know, people

1453
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:27,800
are streaming it. Again, I'm not going to watch it, but at the same time, you using Twitter to

1454
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:36,520
yell at those people like that makes you look like a stupid ass. And meanwhile, folks, guess

1455
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:42,920
what else is happening in the world? Drag queen, anti-drag queen library reading laws are being

1456
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:49,240
passed. Anti-trans bills are being passed. Did you know there's another bill that's going on?

1457
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:54,200
I want to say it's like Tennessee, Kentucky, probably both, honestly, that is trying to mirror

1458
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:59,400
what's going on in Florida. No, it's Indiana is the one that mirrors Florida. While you're all

1459
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:05,720
arguing about, is it ethical to play a video game on my Nintendo Switch when Nintendo is 8%

1460
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:12,360
owned by a Saudi company now that, by the way, we know how, you know, that culture feels about

1461
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:22,120
LGBT rights. While we argue those ethics, actual fucking anti-laws are being passed. And what have

1462
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:32,600
you done from your Twitter account to stop this from happening? Nothing. You are useless with this

1463
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:40,680
bullying. Stop it. And even on top of that, like, I agree that for people who can't get out and do

1464
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:46,440
something, then helping to disseminate correct information via social media is perfectly valid.

1465
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:53,240
But to do nothing but rant without putting forward any sort of factual

1466
02:25:54,280 --> 02:26:01,080
evidence. I mean, it's inherently a fallacious argument. You're just being an ass, like you said.

1467
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:09,240
And I think that all of us who profess our allyship need to do something. I mean,

1468
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:13,080
everything is going to have a degree of performance to it. That's just how our world is,

1469
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:21,640
even for the people who are just flat out saying, we're not, you know, I'm not going to play this

1470
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:27,640
game and put it out publicly. You know, that's a little performative. I'll grant it. And I think

1471
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:34,280
in some cases there is a benefit to certain performative actions because it will bring

1472
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:39,720
attention to the thought or make someone who would otherwise have not seen that point of view look at

1473
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:51,480
it. But you have to back up the optics with the true action that goes behind it. You know, for

1474
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:59,000
example, if you are, say, say that you don't have money to donate and you are physically incapable

1475
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:09,240
of going out and protesting, you can write a letter. You know, you can highlight charities,

1476
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:16,520
you know, for, you know, like me, I can't donate to every charity that I want to as much as I want

1477
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:24,360
to. But as a streamer, I can run a charity. You can uplift trans and non-binary streamers

1478
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:29,960
because guess what? When you go to hate watch another streamer that's playing Hogwarts Legacy,

1479
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:35,880
you're still watching and you're helping them to meet their partner metrics and you're helping to

1480
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:43,800
meet their affiliate metrics. You really are. You're part of the problem. So why don't you take

1481
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:51,640
your view and give it to somebody else more deserving? Every action is going to have an

1482
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:57,880
effect no matter what. I mean, think of like that butterfly effect thing, if you will. You know,

1483
02:27:57,880 --> 02:28:05,240
any little thing that you do is going to have an outcome. You deciding to take a breath could

1484
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:12,200
result in maybe a coughing fit because you're like me and you're still congested or it's the

1485
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:18,360
breath you need to take before darting away from someone trying to kill you. You know, it's all

1486
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:24,920
situational. And I think that you need to really look at the big picture. You need to think of how

1487
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:32,600
this action that I am doing right now, what is it going to cascade into? Because honestly,

1488
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:36,120
now the game getting all of this attention is because people did not think about what the

1489
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:46,440
fuck you were doing. Think before you act and do not react. Act. There is a difference between

1490
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:57,240
acting and reacting. Do not let another stimulus determine what you are going to do without looking

1491
02:28:57,240 --> 02:29:01,800
at all sides of the thing. That's why I guess so. Honestly, that's partly why I left Facebook

1492
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:08,600
because it's such a fucking echo chamber and you need to be willing also to step outside of the

1493
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:16,200
damn echo chamber and look at another point of view. Fuck. If you are a diehard socialist like

1494
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:21,560
me, read Fox News, see what the other side is saying. Read the conservative media, see what

1495
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:29,400
the other side is saying. Look objectively at your own beliefs. Be critical of them. Be critical

1496
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:35,560
of what they're doing because you are not going to grow without challenge. And all of these people

1497
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:41,400
out there who are going and yelling at people, you know, that that's not challenging the other

1498
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:45,960
person. That's going to lock them down. And you certainly are not challenging yourself to be

1499
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:55,400
better. You are not an ally by performing this action. All right. Well, a lot of folks in chat

1500
02:29:55,400 --> 02:30:03,160
are being thankful for the discussion tonight. So I'm I'm I'm glad we had it. I guess even though

1501
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:07,640
I didn't really want to in the beginning, I feel like, OK, we've we've had the therapy,

1502
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:15,400
we've aired it out. But let me be very clear. This all being said, fuck this game. I'm over it.

1503
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:18,280
I don't ever want to talk about this game again. There are-

1504
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:20,440
Fuck the game, fuck her, fuck everybody.

1505
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:25,560
There are many other things that are worthy of your attention. By the way, I just want to point

1506
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:31,480
out the trans witches are witches bundle on itch.io is only about $11,000 short of its goal.

1507
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:40,520
And I'm not sure when the deadline is. Oh, till the 24th. So you only have about five more days.

1508
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:48,200
So if you want to maybe these are 69 nice games, I'd rather be talking about right now.

1509
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:56,120
I would rather talk about literally any one of these games than the one that won't go away.

1510
02:30:56,840 --> 02:31:02,840
I like what you said. And by the way, real quick in our text message earlier, because I mean,

1511
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:06,600
I think I might have surprised you by saying I thought that it was really thoughtful email

1512
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:09,560
would provoke a good discussion. So I say we do it. And you said, all right.

1513
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:11,960
I know. I was like, yeah.

1514
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:17,960
But, um, but I like what you said that you treated as a Madden game. You're not interested.

1515
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:19,800
And it's because of her words.

1516
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:26,040
That's right. That that is what it is to me. The Madden games, they sell a ton. Some people find

1517
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:33,880
them to be great games. Cool. I'm still not interested. And that's at least the thing is,

1518
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:40,280
I mean, I could come up with other problems about the NFL. But I just maybe it's a different type

1519
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:45,080
of thing. I'm just not interested in sports at the end of the day. Whereas, you know, in this one,

1520
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:50,440
it's her viewpoints have tarnished the pool or whatever you want to, you know, shit the bed,

1521
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:55,080
whatever analogy you want to use. But it's it's like the same thing. That's how I view it as a

1522
02:31:55,080 --> 02:32:01,000
video game. I just I, there's other games to play. There are lots and lots of other games to play.

1523
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:06,440
And and I think that as you and I discussed a little bit earlier, you saw where I was coming

1524
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:12,280
from with needing to discuss it. And I'm really glad that we did because we have been quiet on it.

1525
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:19,960
But I feel honestly enough that as I mean, at least you and I being under the quilt bag, you

1526
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:27,800
know, and being and all of us being allies to our trans friends, we we have almost a responsibility

1527
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:35,080
to at least say something about it. And I'm glad that we did this. Garth, I absolutely appreciate

1528
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:43,080
your email. You are the MVP of this of this month. And I'm glad that we got it out. I actually feel

1529
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:50,120
better for getting this out. And I don't mind going back to not drawing any more attention to

1530
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:59,160
it. But I do think that as as allies, and as you know, part of the quilt bag, that we have

1531
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:06,680
a responsibility to say something, and I'm glad we did. And if nothing else, let the the failure

1532
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:11,640
of this boycott campaign be a lesson, because there's going to be other video games in the

1533
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:18,120
future that you're going to have some opinions about. And your actions may actually have the

1534
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:23,560
opposite effect of what you're aiming for. Just just act and don't react.

1535
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:31,320
Think ahead, educate around corners. Educate. If somebody doesn't want to be educated,

1536
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:34,600
then that tells you all you need to know about your relationship with that person.

1537
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:40,680
But definitely learned how to look around the corner. anticipate and act accordingly.

1538
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:46,200
All right. Can you believe there's no one waiting to call in tonight?

1539
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,840
I want to talk to people now.

1540
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:50,040
Loki, are you alive?

1541
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:51,800
I'm here.

1542
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:56,120
I'm gonna be late playing my dead by daylight, but this is worth it. I want people to call in.

1543
02:33:56,120 --> 02:34:01,560
Call in because I said no, no, I I'm gonna actually say if nobody is waiting at this point,

1544
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:05,640
we're 15 minutes till nine o'clock in the night on the East Coast. I would like to go ahead and move

1545
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:10,840
to start to wrap up tonight. But if you do have an email for a future week, participate at orange

1546
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:15,480
laundry.com is a great place to send it. I do want to check in real quick with Loki as well and see

1547
02:34:15,480 --> 02:34:19,560
if there's any final thoughts or not final thoughts. I'm sorry, final last minute stories.

1548
02:34:19,560 --> 02:34:20,680
I have one too.

1549
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:29,160
There wasn't too much. It was basically that the preorder bonus art book for was it Zelda,

1550
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:33,640
Tears of the Kingdom has leaked out early. So people are going to look at some of the artwork

1551
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:37,560
and stuff from the game that hasn't been shown yet. I don't really know what spoiler is it

1552
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:41,880
necessarily is. It doesn't really have everything. But yeah, looks like Zelda.

1553
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:47,320
So although Toon Link is in there, so I guess that's somewhat of a spoiler. I don't really

1554
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:52,360
know what purpose that serves. But they have an image of Toon Link with the arm thing just like

1555
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:55,320
Link has in Tears of the Kingdom. So

1556
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:59,080
could be something with the amiibo, but I wouldn't read too much into it.

1557
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:03,160
It also just be like promo stuff or concept art.

1558
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:04,520
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

1559
02:35:06,680 --> 02:35:07,240
Yeah, please.

1560
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:15,880
Um, Insight Editions announced that they are publishing an Amy Rose fortune telling card set

1561
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:22,280
based on the ones that were seen in Sonic Origins and also from the IDW

1562
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:31,080
comic series. And they're going to be available in October

1563
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:39,880
from Barnes and Noble and other online things and it'll be 25 bucks.

1564
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:46,840
The cards are really freaking pretty. Like, really well done. There's like chaos fruit

1565
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:50,760
and chaos emeralds and all kinds of stuff. It looks beautiful.

1566
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:56,600
So I just I just looked at chat. I know I usually don't mention these till after the show. But since

1567
02:35:56,600 --> 02:36:00,440
we're wrapping down here, I noticed during that last discussion, y'all got us to a level three

1568
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:04,520
hype train. That's um, that's really incredible. Thank you so much. Thanks for being a cool

1569
02:36:04,520 --> 02:36:07,800
community. I mean, y'all been really cool and chat with your comments and everything.

1570
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:13,640
So it's it's a nice refreshing change of pace from sometimes what I see on the rest.

1571
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:14,280
Hey, guess what?

1572
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:15,960
The internet. What's that?

1573
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:20,680
Oh, we've already finished. I tried to bump us to level four.

1574
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:29,800
Don't. Oh, well. That's all right. Um, okay. With that, let's wrap up. It's been it's been a good

1575
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:34,600
show tonight. But it's gonna have to last you for two weeks. We will not be here next week. Don't

1576
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:43,160
forget. And that's all my fault. And I am not sorry about it. But Jamie will still be streaming

1577
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:48,440
our pal Bobby Blackwell will be here with his usual show at eight o'clock Eastern five o'clock

1578
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:53,320
Pacific here at bog network. So you have plenty to watch just you know, just a week off otherwise.

1579
02:36:54,040 --> 02:36:57,560
Those of you that have a three day weekend this weekend, I hope you have a nice long weekend.

1580
02:36:57,560 --> 02:37:01,880
And plus, this is one of those weekends where I don't have to be like, remember why the holiday

1581
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:07,640
exists like it's President's Day. All right, cool sales, you know, like, it's, it's, it's whatever.

1582
02:37:07,640 --> 02:37:12,920
So um, yeah, that's that's gonna do it for this week of orange was radio. If you enjoyed what

1583
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:17,560
you heard here, if you want to join our awesome community, please do we're here live on Sunday

1584
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:21,480
nights over at vog network. But of course, you can join us on Discord chat throughout the week,

1585
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:27,160
we still have our podcast family as well. Always you can email us, you could tweet us at OLR.

1586
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:31,880
Although I think I've made my issues with Twitter clear, but I'm trying I'm lazily keeping an eye on

1587
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:40,040
it. Not like I used to though, let me say that. And yeah, all that stuff. So tell a friend or

1588
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:43,160
two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every giver has a voice.

1589
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:47,960
But we need more voices here to put out on air a nice five star review on a site wherever you

1590
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:54,120
found this show, whether it was iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, podcasts, whatever it was, hit that five

1591
02:37:54,120 --> 02:38:01,080
star button. If it has a review option, say they're cool. And leave a nice review. That

1592
02:38:01,080 --> 02:38:06,040
would be great. With that, let's get to final thoughts. Dark Sakura, you're going to do all

1593
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:12,200
this and stream. So give us your final thought tonight. I'm I haven't decided if I'm going to

1594
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:17,480
do a killer only or play some survivor. So if anyone wants to Swift with me, you know where my

1595
02:38:17,480 --> 02:38:24,120
chat is. All right. Have a good night, Jamie. We'll see you next two weeks. See you then.

1596
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:28,760
I won't. All right, Loki, your final thought for tonight.

1597
02:38:29,800 --> 02:38:37,960
My final thought is that I need to work faster at my Minecraft stuff. I think you're onto something

1598
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:44,440
with maybe taking on smaller builds. I know you know, big projects. You're like my first game is

1599
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:49,560
going to be pixel poops number two. I'm not going to build a clone of solitaire. I'm going to just

1600
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:55,400
end. But hey, you know what? You get it done one way or the other because you got that pixel poops

1601
02:38:55,400 --> 02:39:02,520
games done and which just celebrated a year if I'm not mistaken. And two years. Oh, how appropriate

1602
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:08,680
number two. And of course, your YouTubes are great. And people will people have got to find

1603
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:15,080
them eventually. So here's hoping. My final thought, I'll be streaming more theater than

1604
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:20,280
this week, probably not tonight, but tomorrow, Monday, and then probably a little bit Tuesday,

1605
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:25,560
a little bit Wednesday. And then I'll be on streaming vacation for a week. And then by the

1606
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:30,440
time I get back, God, we're almost going to be into the Diablo four beta, which we didn't even

1607
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:35,320
talk about tonight, but the open beta is going to be happening there, and so forth. So there's,

1608
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:39,240
there's just a lot of stuff like I was looking at the stuff I want to stream this year. There is so

1609
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:47,160
much but yeah, streaming is is up and up. It's fun. Thank you for being here with us tonight as

1610
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:52,600
we're doing streaming and streaming this show. I hope you all have a great week. If nothing else

1611
02:39:52,600 --> 02:40:01,640
from tonight's discussion, like treat each other with some decency. Educate. I don't know what else

1612
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:04,680
to say here at the end of the show. We hope to educate you a little more in two more weeks on

1613
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:07,800
what's going on in the gaming industry. Have a wonderful night, everybody. Take care of each
