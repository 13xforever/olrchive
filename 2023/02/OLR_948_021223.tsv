0	25000	Samba de Amigo is back! Samba de Amigo is back! A Dreamcast Jam is back! Apparently it came out on the Wii? I somehow missed that. Samba de Amigo, Nintendo Switch, this summer.
25000	37000	This is the 2020's Rhythm Game Renaissance Update. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's Nintendo Direct and other gaming news. Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	65000	I wonder what we'll be talking about tonight. Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 948 of our show for tonight, February the 12th of 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined tonight by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66000	69000	Oh, hi. I'm just looking up some plumbers.
70000	72000	Oh, Mario Luigi?
72000	76000	I found a really good website with some plumbers on it. SMBplumbing.com.
76000	79000	I saw this. Super cute. Lots of nostalgia there, right?
79000	82000	As seen on TV. The website is real.
82000	84000	And on the big screen soon, right?
84000	85000	Yeah.
86000	102000	I know you're off cam tonight for those that are watching live on our Twitch because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, usually after the Bobby Black Wolf show. He's off tonight. Apparently there's this thing on TV a lot of people get together and watch. I don't know her so we're here.
102000	103000	This is not Elf?
104000	108000	It's not about that. Who? Definitely. Who?
108000	110000	Who?
110000	112000	I've just been hearing about the Rihanna show.
112000	123000	I did hear that Rihanna announced she was pregnant with a new album. She announced she was pregnant. Period. So that was the big news I heard on the TV watching front.
124000	136000	And I, of course, because I don't watch the Superb Owl, I've been hearing about the new Marvel movie trailers. So I went watching them while we were prepping. And I'm already a little bit excited.
136000	153000	There's a lot of people out there where the Super Bowl is less about football and more about commercials and about half times and food, food, bean dip, seven layer bean dip, and those types of things, which I think is really the case for Mr. Black Wolf when his team isn't in it.
154000	157000	If his team's in it, I think he feels a little differently.
157000	168000	Hey, somebody's sports better than the other person's sports. They got the weird oval to the other side of the marching band field.
168000	178000	I saw the greatest TikTok today that was like, okay, gays, here's what's going on today. Every other team has sashayed away and now we're down to two.
178000	180000	Having their lip sync for their life.
181000	183000	It was great. It was great.
183000	185000	Well, you know, you know, it's just a marching band field.
185000	200000	Yeah, I know. I know. Anyway, I know it's Yes, screw screw the ballgame. It's all about the halftime show, whether it's Rihanna or a marching band, the way the way they used to do it, whether it's Carol Channing, and the United States marching band doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
200000	209000	Anyway, but in all seriousness, you're off cam tonight because I know last week you came on for a little cameo and you kind of mentioned you were getting over COVID. You certainly sound-
209000	211000	Well, I had just come down with COVID.
211000	215000	Yeah, yeah. So you're sounding a lot better tonight.
216000	231000	Yesterday. Yeah. But I am still, I'm still pretty symptomatic. I've got the cough. My voice is still healing. So I took like the whole week off of streaming and I'll see how I feel for tomorrow.
231000	240000	But I'm sorry, but for right now, it's just a matter of preservation because I do still have to go back to work on Wednesday.
240000	252000	Yeah. Understandable. Well, I'm glad, you know, as much as I know you, you've been very reliable with your streaming. You're very dedicated and really stick to your schedule. And this probably kind of stinks for feeling a little bit derailed.
252000	257000	But at the same time, it really probably is what's best for your voice and why you sound pretty good tonight. So, you know,
257000	272000	Exactly. Well, I'll be honest, the fatigue, you know, got me pretty, pretty bad this time around. Last time, I mean, I know this is absolutely a different strain because there's that newer strain right now.
272000	283000	But last time I had more of like the ongoing cough and that, and this time I just sort of got everything all at once.
283000	293000	So, all right, but but also this time I had got the Pax Loved, which didn't make anything taste funny to me. It just made everything smell funny.
293000	312000	Right. Well, I'm glad I'm glad it's helping you recover a little quicker than you know, maybe a lot of people that end up with COVID. So, all right. But let me say hello, I don't want to ignore and I'm gonna I'm gonna at least try to get because the picture looks a little lopsided without Jamie's camera on someone at least fix it to get that little static picture of her we have on Discord.
312000	317000	But say hello while I fix things live because we love to do things live here. Say hello to tech master Loki.
317000	318000	Hello.
318000	319000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
319000	320000	Doing fine.
320000	324000	Good, good. What are you been up to this week outside of video games? Anything exciting?
324000	326000	I went and played mini golf today.
326000	328000	Oh, really?
328000	330000	There are old stopping ground.
330000	337000	Really? I was gonna ask Golf Land or Scandia or Surprise somewhere else like when they have like indoor mini golf places some places.
337000	349000	Yeah, we played most of those we went to Golf Land because I've taken the I thought I've taken the kids there multiple times but they only remember playing one side of the course who wouldn't play the other side of the course today.
349000	350000	Okay.
350000	353000	How sad is the is the arcade?
353000	382000	It's fine. The arcades fine because they have new games everywhere. They're doing the construction or something there because there's we played laser tag there as well and they're like in the corner of the arena. There's like a bunch of concrete bags or something they're storing in the corner there. So like, okay, I guess. Yes, this is under construction. But no, it's it's actually not in like horrible shape. It's very like, big, like, you know, the redemption games are ridiculous.
382000	395000	Obviously, they're huge. I saw today it an injustice arcade game. So you remember injustice the DC Superheroes thing. It's a fighting game with no directional stick.
395000	396000	What?
396000	398000	Oh, that's weird. Yeah, it's weird. It has
398000	401000	It should play like Mortal Kombat.
401000	416000	Well, doesn't it has? It has special attack, jump, attack in like something else. I'm like, how, how do I move? It's like, how would how would he move? It's built for kids to slam buttons, basically, I guess I mean, I guess that's what it is.
417000	431000	Something. So they've got that they've got like those dropper machines, which are like, it's like a size of a two story house. It's just ridiculously huge. And then King Kong VR.
432000	459000	There's lots of lots of big redemption games. I didn't really walk around the arcade too much because I wasn't really there to play arcade games. The feel it's it's it's obviously it's not as like well put together as it used to be. Like there's a good section like backward the old bimani games used to be that it's like under construction or something there. They have like a like a wall that you can take pictures against or something. And then like there's I don't know stuff just around.
459000	462000	But I mean, they've added stuff to it. They have like bumper cars now.
463000	480000	I want to I want to the arcade space is just going to get taken up with something that can get more money like either they're built like I remember the place used to have a subway in there to you know, make money for food or maybe they're putting another snack bar or something. I don't know what else generates revenue inside an arcade maybe a maybe a bar bar honestly for adults.
480000	491000	Yeah. They don't have a subway there anymore. They have like their own generic sandwich place or I don't even know if the sandwich place is open. They have a snack bar still. And it's got like, you know, pizza.
492000	493000	We kept getting ice.
494000	497000	Yeah. Oh, yeah. Maybe Yeah, no, it was Yeah, back in the day.
498000	521000	So they have that and then just like the same old stuff that they used to have like the go karts and stuff like that. They like so they've added bumper cars, because that's now where there was like a patio area out where the water slides are. And so they took up some of that with that. They have like Dippin Dots, you know, they sell that which is really, you know, expensive.
522000	535000	I mean, it's okay. I mean, it's holding up pretty well. I think considering obviously, like I said, you know, the arcade is very much redemption games, but they're like really flashy, like big redemption games.
535000	554000	Yeah. Um, so I mean, I am not on. I'm not a fan of VR in the arcade, considering how dirty everybody is. Like, do I really want to put the headset on after someone else has been wearing it? Yeah. It looks cool. But no, that's not for me not doing that.
554000	564000	That's been a problem forever. You know, it seems like VR is something kind of newer. But I remember when we were all going to the arcade to play DDR regularly, didn't they have like, wasn't beachhead a thing? Like, wasn't that a thing?
564000	571000	Yeah, yeah, that was the thing that was less like you put your face up into it, like the screen was there, but you weren't actually physically attaching this.
571000	573000	It was still VR.
573000	579000	So yeah, we're talking about Roseville Golf Land sun splash. It's out here in California.
579000	587000	We're reminiscing because this is basically the place where Loki dark soccer and I all met, you know, just a little, you know, history for those that aren't aware, orange.
587000	601000	I was ready to started because Loki dark soccer myself, we played DDR. And you know, obviously the we were some of the faces that would show up there time and time again, there was a little community built up around that and posting on DDR freak and the sites around the time and so forth. So
601000	604000	eating my birthday cake on the floor.
604000	606000	Yeah, yeah. I mean, just, you know, lots of
606000	607000	DDR fourth mix.
607000	619000	So it's it's kind of like Loki went to like the 20th high school reunion or something like that, like went back to our old stomping grounds just to see how everything has just changed.
619000	623000	I would go to RV GL before I went to one of my high school reunions just FYI.
623000	624000	For sure. Yeah.
624000	626000	Strong same.
626000	627000	That's easy.
627000	636000	I would rather see some of the old sacramentals and you know which ones I'm talking about. I'd rather see them than some of the people I went to high school with to be quite honest.
636000	648000	For sure. Absolutely. I was going to say, though, like, it's still like, I think it's still holding up pretty well considering like we went and played their laser tag, the laser tags been all redone.
648000	663000	So it's much nicer now, which is nice. So I did enjoy that quite a bit. Just like, it's just no contest. If I'm there with my kids, we're just going to stop like everybody else. And that's what we did. It was just bad.
663000	679000	But I love that. And it's fun. So yeah, the arcades. All right. I just, I don't think they even have any rhythm music games anymore. Honestly, if we're going to do that, like, I would just go to the one that's now in Folsom, the new one that's at the outlet.
679000	680000	Yeah, I gotta go check that.
681000	682000	Go check that place out. Yeah.
683000	697000	That's a modern music game community guy that like, produces that place. So I'm not surprised. That's up to the level. Yeah. Okay. Let me ask one more question from our chat. And then we got to get into video games and what's going on this week because obviously we had some big news this week.
698000	702000	Matt with the very important question. Did you go to Brookfield's and have the mozzarella sticks?
702000	714000	No, because we went to Red Robin before that. And so we ate there first. No, that would have been fun. But no, like the kids wanted to go eat a certain thing. I'm sure that would have been down for those that don't get the joke.
714000	720000	Brookfield's was the little cafe area is still actually it's still there all the time. They're still there. It's the same menu.
720000	722000	Like a little cafe. It's a chain. Yeah.
722000	724000	A very small chain.
724000	725000	Ish.
725000	726000	Step up.
726000	734000	The funny thing is that I have been totally wanting someone to go to Brookfield's for me just to get me a bucket of the Avgo limino that they have.
734000	737000	That's like the favorite thing to have when I'm not feeling well.
737000	739000	It's good. They always have good soups there.
739000	743000	I tried. I finally made it for myself. And it was almost as good.
743000	758000	But that's really where this show together because it wasn't about playing DDR at the arcade. It was about sitting around eating mozzarella sticks at, you know, fourth dinner after eating after being at the arcade, and just talking about us talking about video games.
758000	769000	And that's that's where this show is 21 years later after those first mozzarella sticks. So all right, well, on that note, let's get into what we do here at the show and talk about what is going on in games.
769000	774000	Obviously, I think you all know the big news of the week. I'm sure many of you were watching the Nintendo Direct. I know you.
774000	776000	Yeah, Rihanna's pregnant.
776000	778000	I know you all have thoughts.
778000	780000	That was not covered in the Direct.
780000	786000	But maybe they'll be. Today was the Rihanna Direct. Earlier this week was the Nintendo Direct.
786000	796000	And, you know, already people I see in chat. Hi, DBZ9410 says the Direct was awesome, but my only gripe is We Heart Katamari isn't coming out until June.
796000	805000	Well, let's talk about that. And let's talk about the other stuff that happened at the Nintendo Direct because I think people have, from what I gather, some real strong feelings across the board.
805000	812000	Some people thought this was the best. I saw comments on Mastodon. This is the best Direct Nintendo has ever done.
812000	820000	I've seen comments that were like, I slept during that entire presentation. This is a very polarizing kind of Direct, I think.
820000	826000	But let's recap and see where we land here. Loki, if you wouldn't mind telling us what we just saw.
826000	840000	I did watch it. I wouldn't say it's the best or the worst. It was just a Direct. It was another Direct. They had some surprises. They had a few games. I'm just like, why is this getting a fourth sequel? Why this?
840000	863000	I felt it did what it needed to do. That was my feeling on the Direct. There were some games where I was like, Oh, you know, I'm not that into this. But I definitely noticed Nintendo leaning into their strength. And that is multiplayer couch gaming, like, you know, with what they were showing like the Kirby and stuff, not to get too ahead of myself. But I think even though there was some stuff where I was like, maybe I personally am not into this.
863000	871000	I think they really did try to kind of cover a lot of their bases with what they showed. But anyway, let me let Loki get into it. And then we can, you know, right.
871000	889000	Right. So, um, like this good, not really going to be in order here. But, um, some stuff that we saw, as Jason mentioned in the intro Samba de Amigo Party Central, coming to the switch. That's pretty exciting. You know, using the joy cons as maracas and stuff like that.
889000	893000	I wish they had a way that I could actually use my maracas from Dreamcast with it.
893000	897000	I bet somebody will sell a cheap plastic attachment just like they did with the Wii version.
897000	904000	You can take your maracas, you take your joy cons, you duct tape them to them. There you go.
904000	922000	Duct tape mod. I really liked the look of the new Samba game. It's very much like what the year 2000 looked like before the year 2000. That was kind of the look of Samba de Amigo to me. I wish we knew a little more about the song list. I'm very curious if they're going to dip in the licenses.
922000	931000	There are licenses, I think. Oh, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Obviously, I just the burning Rangers theme.
931000	943000	I don't remember the brain Rangers theme stuff. I'm trying to see there's, I thought there's a little pop up that they did talking about license songs. Yeah, we know how to play this.
943000	961000	Sorry, wasn't trying to get the audio back through but I was trying to show some video here live as we are talking about Samba de Amigo here. Might as well do the second screen thing here so y'all can see it. But yeah, I mean, I like the look of it. Is it too late for Samba de Amigo to make a comeback?
961000	974000	No, no, it's seamless. It's never too late. Yeah, so they have 40 songs is that across the genres. I guess they didn't mention licenses or not, but it's cool. 40 songs is still pretty solid.
974000	988000	Well, and you know, they're gonna lean into Sega stuff like there will absolutely be like, you know, probably like the fantasy zone song. Something from Yakuza will be in there. Hopefully we can get, you know, like karaoke songs to the top.
988000	990000	Yeah, I want the karaoke songs.
990000	1014000	Yeah, the karaoke songs will be in there. So I'm sure there'll be a little bit of that because that's what Sega always does. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So but, um, the other thing I just want to say about this game. We did know a little while back that Sega has been working on wanting to revive some of their old properties, right? I feel like that was some stories we talked about where Sega is kind of like exploring that. And so this definitely feels like a product of that.
1014000	1033000	I wouldn't mind seeing a Space Channel five done in this kind of style. I know we had to say it again. Did we have a VR Space Channel five or something like that wasn't the last one? Yeah, so it would be nice to see like a new one. I think they could do that if this takes off, you know, I could see them coming back for that. We'll see.
1034000	1057000	Advanced Wars one and two reboot camp is now finally coming out. It was delayed, of course, because of the whole Ukraine Russia war thing. So now that is coming out looks like April 21, which is about a year later than it was originally. We got a new trailer for Bayonetta Origins, Syriza and the Lost Demon. And yeah, it's all right. It doesn't come out March.
1057000	1082000	It does look cute, but I'm gonna be completely honest. And this isn't a read. This is just something that happens in video games sometimes and it's it's okay. It's you know what happens. This game looks like something that didn't start as Bayonetta. It looks like something that started as something else and somebody decided let's make this like a Bayonetta game to maybe drive more copies or something like that's my honest reaction.
1083000	1091000	Kotaku's description of it I think sums it up perfectly. This is to Bayonetta what Muppet Babies is to the Muppet show.
1091000	1109000	I don't know about that. That that just seems a little like somebody thought that was a cute thing to compare it to that. I just I feel like God I'm trying to think of a game like I don't know maybe Silent Hill The Room or something which didn't actually start as a Silent Hill game. If well, I don't know actually I've heard that that's been
1110000	1112000	remind you a little bit of Okami.
1112000	1116000	A little bit. Yeah, with that cell art style for sure.
1116000	1132000	But just some of the way the scenery looks Yeah, or maybe like a beautiful Joe type of thing. Maybe Yeah, but but I also think that maybe it's something to expand the universe to make it more accessible to other players who may not be into the Bayonetta genre.
1133000	1153000	Oh, that's a good thought. Maybe something like to make the genre because let's be real Bayonetta is not exactly a family friendly franchise. But this might be something where it's like, Oh, well, you know, you can still get the Bayonetta character out there in front of younger folks with an age appropriate game. I'm assuming I don't you know, I don't know if she drops the F bomb.
1153000	1164000	But young Bayonetta Yeah, so maybe it's a way to kind of just expand Bayonetta's reach to sell more merch. I don't know that is a clever insight on that.
1164000	1182000	I mean, it would make sense to me and especially since Nintendo seems to have a big focus on doing a few more family friendly things, things that all people could get into because fans of Bayonetta are going to want to play, you know, especially the diehard fans, even though it might look like it's a simple game, they're going to want to play it.
1182000	1193000	Yeah. And then, you know, people who are like, Oh, this looks like a fun, you know, let's run around and be a little girl in her world of dreams, blah, blah. So, yeah.
1193000	1198000	I see a Tiberian chat calls it maybe Netta, maybe, maybe.
1198000	1199000	I know.
1199000	1200000	Right.
1200000	1203000	bassinetta.
1203000	1204000	Funny.
1204000	1209000	We had a game called Master Detective archives rain code.
1209000	1213000	Looks like it's from the developers behind dangan rampa.
1213000	1214000	Yeah.
1214000	1218000	And it looks strange, but neat and
1218000	1222000	definitely looks like the spike chin soft.
1222000	1223000	It'll have an audience.
1223000	1225000	Yeah, I'll play it.
1225000	1238000	Another trailer for Disney Illusion Island, which kind of has that cuphead. I mean, it's more than the modern Mickey Donald goofy thing. Yeah, it's, it's all right. I don't know.
1238000	1241000	But they're gonna have that coming out in July.
1242000	1261000	Actually, I think this is kind of a big deal. I really do. I think this is a much stronger announcement than most people are giving it credit for no offense, no offense, because I completely you know, everybody has their opinion and no opinion is invalid. But I feel like, you know, obviously Disney games are always going to have an audience, you know, the Disney brand is very strong.
1262000	1274000	I think this is a really interesting way to kind of bring back those old Genesis games, the castle of illusion and all that stuff. You know, those games are obviously very legendary for their time. And we know they re release those and so this seems like kind of like a step forward for it.
1274000	1284000	But I think also the other very important part of this is that it appears they've instituted what I was talking about before the couch co op thing, although I, I'm assuming it'll work online too.
1284000	1308000	I think the couch co op potential for this game as like, family friendly, but not even necessarily just for families for people that enjoy platformers and so forth. I think there's a lot here that kind of reads to me like a new Super Mario Brothers with all four characters you can play at once meets the Disney castle of illusion stuff meets a really cool art style here. I actually think this is a big deal.
1308000	1315000	I mean, we'll see the quality of the game when it's actually released, because obviously I'm seeing the trailer. But I think this has the potential to move a lot of units.
1317000	1330000	We also got another trailer a little bit more of a deeper dive on Pikmin four, which is coming out in July. And they say it's been on been worked on since 2015.
1331000	1339000	Cool. I'm glad people like Pikmin. I just feel that other games deserve a sequel versus three sequels.
1340000	1348000	I can't say I'm super excited about Pikmin. But some of the characters look cute, which is funny because I play the Pikmin mobile game. But yeah, it's very different than the console games.
1349000	1364000	Another one may they pretty much ended with a new trailer for legends of the tears of the kingdom. So that would look pretty cool. And that's obviously for pre order. And yeah, it very interesting.
1365000	1368000	I'm gonna have new new mebo. So that's cool.
1369000	1393000	Hot take incoming. I thought the trailer was kind of weak, considering this game is three months out. And maybe they're just trying to hold a bunch of secrets or whatever. But I was fully expecting like a 15 minute deep dive, or something a little longer. I mean, it's not. It's not bad. But when you couple it with the other headline, and I know we'll dive into it a little more in detail later in the show, but about the $70 price tag, they're asking for this game.
1394000	1423000	I felt they didn't do a good enough job justifying that I think that I mean, it's not ultimately it's not gonna matter. People are gonna eat this up. If it's if it's anywhere close to a strongest breath of the wild was it's going to be a good game. I'm just a little surprised by the strategy on multiple fronts. But I think Nintendo can be bold here. I think they will get away with it. I don't think gamers are gonna gamers are gonna fork it up. And that's why they're doing it. So
1424000	1453640	here's a weird thing about this game to begin with, like I always thought from like the early trailers, it made it seem like it was going to be a two player co op game. Like you one person would control link and the other would control Zelda, almost but like it doesn't seem that that's what this is, which is kind of weird. I thought that would be kind of the new gimmick to it. But I guess not. What else? We had a Xenoblade Chronicles three expansion pass volume three. So they talked about some new outfits and stuff like that and new
1453640	1476280	character thing. And what else? fashion dreamer is coming up. Yep. And you have to suggest outfits for influencers and do some stuff there. And this out of absolutely nowhere Tron identity. Looks like looks like a visual novel game or something like that. So that's kind of cool.
1476280	1495480	Well, actually, they actually did announce that at the game awards, but it was like, I think, literally the logo. And I think we knew it was a story based game at the time. This is the first we've seen any of like the actual game. So it looks good. Yeah, no, it does. Yeah, I just I'm thrilled to see Tron coming back. I hope the story is good. I really do.
1496480	1501680	Now, can we have a movie? Right? With that without, you know, who anyway?
1502200	1509000	Well, there was still something though, out of there that I'm a little bit more excited about Dan and I were talking about this morning.
1509960	1515280	Well, let's let's keep going and see if Loki gets there. Is there any other headlines in chat too? So it's fine.
1515360	1539160	Yeah, ghost trick is getting a remake, I believe, or remaster for the switch. So that's pretty cool. This was neat. It's just goes to show like other people can make Konami games better than Konami. But dead cells, we knew that they had that whole return to Castlevania thing. Well, we got more of a look of it now. And it looks fantastic.
1539680	1550320	It's rector. Yeah, it looks really it's just like, let's just let these guys just make another Castlevania game. Like just let them do it because they're gonna do it way better than you can.
1550320	1580320	Deca police, which I'm not really sure what it is, but it looks weird. And that is coming out here pretty soon. Splatoon 3 DLC had my head scratching. I have no idea what this is supposed to be. But apparently they've got you know, wave one, which is Inkopolis, which is from the original game. Is it just a new HUD area? Is that it? And then they also had wave two, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area, which is a new HUD area
1580320	1610320	two, which is side order, which looks like a different art style and a different HUD area. I'm gonna say something bold and sensationalist, but I mean it. This is the biggest flop announcement Nintendo has done in a long time. The Splatoon DLC was not sold or explained well whatsoever. It like if that wave one, if that really is what it is, they're trying to say, Oh, it's a new hub, but you do all the same things in this hub, if you want to, that you don't do in the other hub, you know, or that you
1610320	1640320	can already do the other, it didn't make sense. Like, where's the new story stages? Where's the new like, do you do you play in Inkopolis or something like that? And Mike Def points out side order is the story DLC. But yeah, Inkopolis seems like it's just a new hub. So why the fuck would I buy Inkopolis? Unless, do you have to buy both together? Is that what it is?
1640320	1670320	There's no way I would buy this until that side order is out and explained better. I think this was a complete misfire and the lowest point of the entire direct. And I'm not that's not a read on Splatoon, the game is fine. It's just we've come to expect very rich DLC packages from Nintendo, they typically knock it out of the park. You know, with the DLC they've done for Mario Kart 8. Fucking even that Mario Kart 8 announcement, sorry, I know you're not there yet. But even that Mario Kart 8 announcement was way better than what they did for Splatoon.
1670320	1700320	To it was it was a flop. Sorry. Yeah, the Mario Kart 8 announcement wasn't even for like the whole thing of DLC is just saying, hey, we're making a new Yoshi's Island track that's going to be in the next, you know, course pack or whatever that's coming out. And Birdo is going to be in the game as well. Which I'm sorry, but trans rights icon Birdo coming out this week in particular, that's all I'm going to say, with everything else going on is is great. You know,
1700320	1730320	and Birdo Birdo is a great character to be putting in the game. So I'm thrilled.
1730320	1760320	Octopath Traveler 2, they showed off some more of that. And there was a demo that was out, which is pretty cool. It's also on PlayStation, by the way, if you didn't know. Sometimes that happens with these directs. It's actually a stealth release on multiple fronts. It's just Nintendo gets to unveil it. Yeah. We love Katamari reroll plus Royal Reverie, which is a remake of We Heart Katamari. And then they're also I guess you can play as the king as well, which is neat. I love Katamari.
1760320	1790320	I love Katamari as well, which is why I'm gonna be I am actually really frustrated that they're just not doing a new Katamari game. Like why do they have to go back and keep remastering the old ones? I'm not saying the old ones are bad. But I'm like, if, if the sales of Katamari Damacy reroll, the first one they remastered, if the sales were strong enough there to justify continued releases in the Katamari series, why aren't they investing in a new game? Why are we still getting a remaster of one
1790320	1820320	that's been already out? I don't know. I mean, again, it was out several cycles ago. Was that PlayStation 3, Xbox 360? So, you know, and it's very hard. But can you play We Heart Katamari on Xbox Series S with 360 compatibility? I'm pretty sure it was on the Switch. Was we? Oh, no, no, no, no, we are made the reroll was on Switch. No, yeah. No, no, no, I'm talking about but We Heart Katamari, the original was a 360 PS3 game. And I think you can probably play it on probably play it. So I just
1820320	1850320	like I'm kind of in this place. Okay, cool. But like, why won't you just do a new Katamari game? Make some new stages have to have the, you know, have the king of all cosmos be a character if that's what you want to do. Like it just it's weird to me. It's weird.
1850320	1880000	Okay, so we're gonna move on to the next game. And it's going to be on June 1, which looked pretty cool. Nice RPG stuff. Sea of Stars also another kind of 90s styled RPG game that's coming out. And what else? Omega Strikers, which is like a soccer anime looking game. Then we get into some of the more interesting things. Also, just like why is it taking so long? But Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games finally coming to Nintendo Switch.
1880320	1910200	Online. And so they had lots of games with that Super Mario Advance for Mars, Super Mario Bros. 3, WarioWare Inc. Kuro Kuro Kurin, Mario Kart Super Circuit, Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga, The Legend of Zelda Minish Cap. And I think Game Boy games. No, we had Tetris, which I was surprised that they put that in there. Super Mario Land 2, Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening DX, Gargoyle's Quest, Game & Watch Gallery 3,
1910680	1914640	Alone in the Dark, The New Nightmare. I don't know why you'd want it.
1915640	1939840	It is a strange lineup, isn't it? On both both fronts. I mean, there's like some real heavy hitters in there. Like you said, I think Tetris on the Game Boy is like a real huge and pleasant surprise. I would have assumed that licensing wouldn't have made that possible. But you know, I'm not a legal person. So whatever, they got it cleared somehow. That's pretty cool. What do you think about the whole like Game Boy is for regular Switch Online where Game Boy Advance is
1939840	1945680	for Switch Online expansion pack? I think that's I still don't have expansion pack for the record.
1946360	1956840	I have it because we were doing it for the Animal Crossing stuff. I don't think my kids even play the Switch anymore. I mean,
1957760	1960440	I'm still on a friend's plan.
1960960	1985840	Ah, that's a way to do it. Um, let me go to a question that was asked in chat a little bit earlier about the story. DBZ9410 in chat, who I believe is new tonight in chat. So hello, thanks for being here tonight says, Do you think Nintendo will give us a format on how games on Nintendo Online will be released going forward? Like one of the month NES ones SNES and one Game Boy game, week two, one Genesis game? Yeah, and lays it out.
1986360	2014640	No, no, Nintendo is not going to hold themselves to that kind of calendar because nobody's gonna nobody's gonna hold back their money for them not doing it. I do think though, this lineup of games is intentionally weird and all over the map and very limited. When NES and SNES launched, there were 30 games in each of those libraries. Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's like six or eight. It's somewhere like it's no more.
2015560	2023680	They're drip feeding it so that you you stay enrolled in that plan. It is just it is. It's a rip off is what it is.
2023680	2053360	Absolutely leaving the space to do some big game inserts in there. And as you know, we move on and you already saw like, hey, if you had f zero on your bingo card for the direct congratulations, technically you can check it off because they said f zero maximum velocity from the advance is in the slate for the future. And I'm sure, you know, they did Mario advance three. Well, why not? Or I'm sorry. Was that Mario advance for that was who my brothers three?
2053360	2083080	I can't remember the number. But obviously, they're the very first Mario advance was the second game. I think Yoshi's Island was one of them too. And then of course, they did a really good redo of the first Mario Brothers game Super Mario Brothers period from the original Game Boy. So there's a lot of room in there for just all of these other releases. I mean, we still have what like alleyway, the original Super Mario Land on Game Boy, like there's just so much room for more stuff to come out still in the future.
2083080	2112960	And I think I don't think Nintendo is ever going to hold themselves to a regular schedule. They're not going to let you have that benefit of the doubt. And I think as far as the chat comment goes, I don't want to say they're done with NES and Super Nintendo. But there's not much for them left. I think anything else I I'm sure you all still have games on your wish list for that. They are games that are either a third party doesn't want to do it, or licensing is an issue at this point.
2113440	2123280	And so I just think there isn't a lot left for NES and SAS. Yes, I want to see Earthbound as well. But you know, wait, no, did Earthbound come out?
2123920	2153040	I don't remember, but I'm out of it. It's just, you know, I think they really, I think, missed an opportunity with Virtual Console being gone. Honestly, like, I think that was a huge mistake. Because people like collecting games, and even if it's a digital library, like you could still package that in a very interesting way, if you wanted to, like, you know, where you just have your digital collection, you can like, look at the box art and look at all that stuff, like they could have presented it in a really
2153040	2182640	smart way, and sold each one of those for like, like $9 or $8, which I still think it was like, you know, it was still pretty expensive at the time. But people would pay that and like, what, what are you doing now? You're like holding stuff back for an expansion pass. It's like $25 a year. Like you could have made way more money off of that, like if you really were smart about it, but this is Nintendo, and they're just gonna do whatever the hell they want. And that's why they're not going to hold themselves to any sort of like, calendar or
2182640	2197240	schedule because in their eyes, they're not competing against anything. They're not competing against Sony or Microsoft. They're in their own little world. And so they're not competing against anyone, then they're beholden to no one.
2197240	2216760	And just quickly, sorry, sorry, chat. Yeah, I totally forgot the Earthbound games were stealth released last year. So my bad on that. But as 100 Matt points out, Uniracers is a title that's missing that was, you know, I don't know if there's music in that or something. I don't I don't know what the hell it's a great game. Yeah, it's a great game. It's missing. So there's there's still lots they could fill in with for sure.
2217760	2222120	More releases. So we had fantasy life. I the girl who steals time.
2222120	2244080	I thought fantasy life was done for I didn't, you know, because the last the last game was on the 3DS or the DS in like 2012. It's been a long time since we have fantasy life. So the fact that there's a new one coming I was actually like, Oh, shit, that's pretty cool. That was the most unexpected surprise thing to me honest to God, like the new fantasy life. I was like, Whoa, that's awesome.
2244600	2249160	So are those like amiibos or anything? Or is that just like characters that look like amiibos?
2249160	2252840	No, they're just it's it's it's a level five game. So it's just, you know,
2254080	2270040	we have a new Professor Layton game Professor Layton in the world of steam. That's kind of out of nowhere. It looks pretty cool art style wise. Here's something that we probably never thought that we were going to see bait and chaos one in two HD remaster. Yeah, that's surprising.
2270680	2276440	Even more surprising, Metroid Prime remastered and launched the same day.
2276840	2306040	That was that was a clever little thing of Nintendo to do because obviously those those remasters have been Well, I say remasters because I thought it was gonna be the trilogy. But speaking of drip feeding, why would Nintendo unleash the trilogy all at once when they can drip feed $40 for one, two and then three later down the line, which is probably the real plan. So for them to shadow release, you know, part one, that was it was a nice surprise. I think the biggest thing about
2306040	2330080	that news, and I'm gonna be honest, I actually haven't picked it up yet, because something else grabbed my attention this week, and I'll get into that later. But I will pick it up eventually. And I heard that the biggest thing about it is that they actually changed the control, well, optionally changed the control scheme to a modern FPS control scheme, if you want to do that. And that's that's been a game changer for that game for a lot of people. So I'm really excited to check it out.
2330120	2341120	Looks good to like the remaster looks pretty, pretty good. Like the visuals definitely hold up as well. So um, yeah, I don't know why you wouldn't want to play with better controls. But
2341360	2360040	I'm just I'm just shocked that it was a you know, surprise release with a physical version also do. Honestly, at this point, maybe I'll just pick up the physical version since I'm waiting anyway. But I thought that was but when I heard there was a physical version, I was like, Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me, they're going to charge
2360320	2389000	full price for this. That's what they're doing. But then I ended up being wrong. And it's only $40. But I mean, that's, that's about on the higher end of what a remaster you know. Now, you know, but but also I'm like, you know what, if they released f zero for the GameCube remaster with a similar thing with some new tracks or something, I'd fucking pay $40 for it. I'd actually probably pay 60. But don't don't tell Nintendo that.
2390000	2404000	Hmm. Dr. T also points out that Metroid Prime remaster supports the GameCube adapter. Oh, good. I would have never thought of that. Interesting. And orange right says it has optional gyro controls if that's something that you're into. Interesting.
2404000	2433920	Oh, yeah. Is that it? Do we get everything? That was it. That was everything. Yeah. So yeah, at the end of the day, I thought it was a pretty solid direct. I mean, I think for everybody, there was at least one or two things that grabbed your attention. And yeah, some surprise remasters. I guess the even though it wasn't in the US one, the atlier games were also announced for remasters with Biden katos as well. So on the
2433920	2456920	Japanese direct, so that's also the like the level of RPG content would like see a lot of RPG, there was a lot of RPG content. So I think a lot of RPG fans are feeling very fed from that Nintendo Direct. And that's, that's great. You know, I think there was a lot of something for everybody. But then I think the parts in between may have just been a little bit of, you know, not as interesting to you. Dark
2456920	2485640	Sakura seems like there was a lot in that event that you like to some games, you're gonna pick out the Castlevania stuff was was pretty happy for me. You know, it was a overall I mean, I wouldn't say I was disappointed. I just say it was what it was. Yeah. And I've reserved judgment for the final the final pieces. Of course, there's a few things that I'm definitely looking looking forward to. Yeah.
2485960	2506000	I think especially when you consider it's it's a little more of an off cycle direct meaning it's not like E3 or holiday releases or whatever. I think it makes it you know, that much stronger for a February direct. It was pretty good. It actually kind of makes me wonder with these rumors, you know, we were talking last week, Nintendo is not doing E3. And that they may not have holiday releases, which I still refuse to believe.
2506000	2522160	I refuse to believe they will have they easily could have like, what are they gonna do in June? But I think there is a possibility Nintendo may not do a direct until August. I think I don't know. I think they're gonna do one right around E3. I don't think that they're gonna
2522160	2552140	we'll see it's anyone's guess really, it really is. So they can show that there's lots of stuff that they could show me they have like tons of games that aren't coming out right away. Like they can't tell you can't tell me like they don't have a release schedule for like the second half of the year because that doesn't make any sense. They have to have something. Yeah. And this is your 100 map points out the shareholders wouldn't let them not have a holiday releases something. Well, yeah. And I, you know, we all know Metroid Prime 4 is happening at some point. But even even if that has been bumped to the switch's success rate, I think it's going to be a little bit of a
2552160	2582140	lesser, which is what I think is the case at this point, to be quite honest. I they have to be doing a Mario Odyssey sequel, or something in the Mario universe, like what was especially with the fucking movie this year? Where's the new Mario game with that? That that's the biggest shock to me. So I, I would literally be shocked if Nintendo is not bringing Mario to the holidays, of some sort, whether it's, you know, we've also had a rumor of a new 2d Mario, the kind of
2582140	2611920	plays into where Mario maker took things for a while. Just I would just be shocked if there isn't some kind of Mario thing for the holidays. There's got to be. We'll see. All right. Well, for now, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week in how was your gaming week? Dark soccer? I know you've been under the weather, but has that stopped your gaming or is that just increased it? Just so you know, you're muted on Discord right now. I can see the little icon. I don't know if you're trying to talk or what have you or did she step away?
2612140	2623100	That's only a bummer is I can't see the camera. So she may have stepped away for a minute. And I just missed that. So why don't I Oh, yeah, she stepped away for a second. So why don't I go to Loki? Loki, tell us about your gaming week.
2623100	2653020	My gaming week was basically Minecraft, we did a I've been working on a lot of stuff for just designing things for my modded series. We did a live stream from the channel 64 server yesterday. So it was a stream day with 14 hours of content. So that was fun. I participate in that for most of the day, actually, and other people's streams and stuff. I didn't really do much in mine lit up some caves for a friend. So that was that. It was mostly just a little bit of fun.
2653100	2674580	Mostly just talking about things reminiscing about stuff had one of the old collusion MC guys in there. So we were talking about stuff like that. We're kind of thinking back to you know, the stuff that happened there. So that's fun. So yeah, it was a pretty good stream. But yeah, it's pretty much just that I didn't really play any other games of the Minecraft this week. Okay.
2675140	2679140	All right, that sounds like he has some good content making sessions there. So that's good.
2679300	2682500	Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had a lot of fun with that. Nice.
2682900	2712260	All right. Well, while we wait for dark soccer to get back, I'll go ahead with my gaming week then. And so my kind of big news for this week, maybe I'll maybe I'll do a visual here. So I picked up this game. And for those on the podcast feed, I'm holding up a copy of returnal on the PlayStation five. And if I'm holding up a PS five game, that must mean that I got one of these two and I'm holding up a PlayStation five controller, which is still plugged into the charger. But I sure did. I I finally got the PlayStation
2712260	2740500	five. The play the Sony PlayStation five finally met the can I walk into the store and buy it test. And as it turns out, Best Buy had a lot of them available. So I just pretty I did still order it online and go pick it up. But I mean, it's really all the same. If you can go right online, and it's ready in an hour. It's that's that's close enough for me of being on the shelf. So there you go. I finally broke the seal on PlayStation five. Why now?
2740500	2768900	I did it now because especially with theater them coming out, which I know is a is was a PlayStation four game. But I was kind of like, I definitely want to stream that. And I think I'll hook up the PlayStation five in my office here, which I did. That's why I have it all right here. So I can make it really easy to stream from that. I know you can stream within the PlayStation five itself. But I still prefer to do it through OBS and a capture card and all that just because you can have your own looks and the webcam and all that.
2770500	2800460	But I and then of course Final Fantasy 16. I made it no secret. I'm really excited about that. And that is coming out this summer. Also, maybe a little bit motivated, I'm going to be honest by the news of the PlayStation collection going away. And if I wanted to grab all those games, and I just pull the trigger now. So I'm gonna really kick myself if they end up doing a hardware refresh. But with the PlayStation VR on its way out pretty soon, it would be really weird to do a hardware refresh now when they've got
2800460	2830420	to be moving those VR two units. So I just decided to say fuck it. And I did it. I finally pulled the trigger on it. So what have I been playing? Well, obviously, I've been downloading some of my PS four stuff. And I like, I got my cloud save for theater, then moved over to the PlayStation five, which I did through remote play, actually, because I can have my PS five talked to my PS four through a remote play, which is pretty cool. And I did it all while Alan was streaming to see if the bandwidth was strong enough. And it is and that's
2830420	2860020	really exciting. The PlayStation four image was a little amp, but it worked good enough. So I was very, very excited about that. And then of course, I've been playing a little bit of Returnal, I haven't been able to spend a lot of time with it where I can really go into a deep dive with it. But it is a very good looking game and very well shows off the controller and e3 v l in chat says the PlayStation five edge controller is a game changer, especially with software features cost a lot but worth it if you play often. Well, you know, this this new controller on PlayStation five,
2860260	2889300	you know, the haptic really is a game changer. And I, I had, it's this isn't my first time touching a PlayStation five. I mean, when I was at Dragon Con, and at Bobby's house, I played like, a little bit of the Final Fantasy seven remake DLC, which I also need to get to now, by the way, but I played a little bit of that and you know, felt but now that I'm really sitting down spending some extra time and playing Returnal. And especially now that I like I'm finding out, oh, there's a mechanic where like, there is a difference about holding the aim button down halfway, and doing
2889540	2919140	the aim button down the entire way that there is a difference there is very interesting. It's a very weird feeling to get used to. But I kind of like it. It's a it's a neat little feature for that controller. And it definitely seems like the PlayStation fives. Probably most advanced feature is what they're doing with that controller. It's a pretty neat piece of hardware. So but yeah, questmaster says Returnal is a lot of fun, can be tough. Don't be afraid to die. But it's really enjoyable if you love action shooters. I'm definitely getting big
2919140	2948540	Metroid Prime vibes from the game, but like mixed with a roguelike type of thing, which isn't a bad thing. So very, and I also noticed the game kind of gates you into dying, like you have to die at a certain point on your first go through, which is basically how it's teaching you the game. So yeah, I've already gotten to that point for sure. And I'm starting to explore a little more. I just unlocked like being able to teleport and so that so I'm still I think I'm still learning new things about the game. But it's been fun to play so far.
2949260	2978100	Oh, yeah, a three v l points out astro playground is a good one, too. That's right. That comes that's like the pack in game, so to speak with the PlayStation five. I also since I was only able to find the God of War Ragnarok bundle for the PlayStation five. But I was like, is that such a bad thing to be picking up? People seem to really enjoy that game. So I will check that out at some point, too, because it comes with a little digital insert code for God of War Ragnarok. So I'll be checking that out.
2978500	3007940	So that was my gaming week. I mean, otherwise, what does that play? Oh, Final Fantasy 14. I went to Final Fantasy 14 because I wanted to start popping some of the trophies on PlayStation five because the trophy list is different. But here's the funny thing to do it on PlayStation five, you have to like, do a quest, and then all your quest related trophies will pop, kill a monster and all your monster related trophies will pop. So I still have things I need to do just to like get the system to do the trophy check and pop the rest of those. But it's
3007940	3037700	really hard for me to play that game on controller. So I really hope I can just plug my keyboard and my mouse into the PlayStation five and play that way, which you would be able to I would say, I mean, you could do it on the PlayStation three, why would you be able to do that on the five, especially because Final Fantasy 14 is on it. So I would assume I can do that and then do like a dungeon the way I'm used to a keyboard mouse and be able to pop some of those other achievements. But the game I mean, I mean, I have a nice computer. So it runs really well my computer, but it does it runs. It's very, very smooth, like
3037700	3045660	butter on the PlayStation five. I will say that it's pretty cool. So all right, let me cycle back to dark Sakura. Watch. Tell us about your gaming week.
3046620	3075500	Um, well, I did a couple of sessions of Dead by Daylight, I honestly I was a little bit too unwell, I think, to play very effectively, I got through five games and was like, okay, I'm done. But I did make eerie one for survivor. And I got two more adepts. Last week, I got hundreds of all characters, who I stuck at, but I watched a video that talked about the characters
3075500	3081100	hitboxes. And I just remembered to aim for the button. Oh, yeah, you brought that up in a previous week. Yeah, aim for the button.
3082860	3104780	Um, but I also have been playing a lot of Marvel midnight suns just getting through the story since I don't really have the energy for doing a lot of anything else. And of course, there's my word scapes game. I didn't play any star ocean because I haven't streamed it. But I for the first time I finally
3104780	3117660	got my arm twisted into playing among us. And I like it. When I got imposter, I got first four kills before I got caught.
3118700	3120700	How did they catch you? How'd they catch you?
3121340	3134620	Um, I, I think it was just process of elimination. Okay. Because I don't think anyone actually saw me do anything. And then on the second round, I didn't do
3134620	3155180	as well. But I have, but I fooled one of my friends. And then the third, the third time I got imposter, I killed five people. And I was the shapeshifter. And because if you get voted out as the shapeshifter, you become a ghost crewmate. And so we finished the task. So one way or another, I was gonna win.
3155180	3184940	And I really, I really just had a lot of fun. I found myself in one more game, one more game, you know. And, of course, my character ended up being orange. So I repped appropriate. Yeah. And then kind of game related is I busted out a lot of merch. A lot of designs. Oh, cool. I now have a shirt that says hooker.
3185180	3210380	That has a hook on it. I'm kind of surprised that didn't exist somewhere. Maybe it does. But it's your it's your hooker. Well, I'm still waiting on because with fourth wall where I'm doing all my stuff through you have to get approval for like some of the things are like limited things you have to like submit to have them put to your store. And I submitted kids stuff that says hooker in training.
3210380	3240300	How funny I have more Amy the teeny little symbol. And I have I have a few other things. And then I also made my ski or Mon shirt. Oh, that's that's clever. I like that. Yeah, it looks like it's straight from the 80s. So I'm actually finding my creative thing again. And I'm considering doing Yes, I said hooker in training.
3240300	3268300	It's a reference to Dead by Daylight bonds double six. Yeah. But but it's been kind of good that my brains waking up that I'm getting my my game inspiration to do designs and stuff. So but I really I really though I and I got an achievement that I kind of thought I wanted to get in among us. I killed somebody while I was disguised as them.
3268300	3298060	It was great. Perfect. I had so much fun as imposter. Sounds like you had a pretty action packed gaming week in spite of being sick. So Oh, yeah. And we actually have another pinball now. We traded out in a indie indie 5000 for Beatles, the set up like the like one of the classic pinball tables. You know, the kind of open field with the big circle thing and except it's got like the full motion video and it's like,
3298380	3328140	early eras. Beatles music. That's cool. And I put a little thing of Dan having a good ball on it on on tik tok. I need to come play. It's I'm overdue to come to your house and play. It's all Dan's negative. Yeah, it's it's gonna have to wait till after the cruise at this point. But yeah, yeah, for sure. Oh, I'll find I'll find the video for folks in chat. All right. Okay, well, let's get into some gaming news. Speaking of the cruise I just mentioned, I remember there's
3328140	3334220	not going to be a show in two weeks. We will not be here on February 26. We will be here next weekend
3334220	3339500	for President's Day weekend. Bobby will be back as well tonight over the voice keys network or sorry,
3339500	3344380	next week on Sunday night over the voice keys network. And yeah, that'll be that'll be kind of
3344380	3348940	our last show for a couple weeks. And then we'll be back in early March with our next show. So
3348940	3355420	that's, yeah, it's February is just flying by, of course. So good times. But I'm very excited
3356060	3362460	to get get out of get out of town for a week and just relax. It's been a busy,
3362460	3367020	busy year at work and all that stuff. And yeah, I'm just very excited to get out and see the world.
3367020	3373740	So all right, well, let's move on. Let's get into some headlines from what's going on in video games.
3373740	3377660	So Loki, why don't you start us off, although I really feel like the Nintendo Direct was the big
3377660	3383100	news, but there's there's some other things going on around. Yes, the never ending saga of the
3383100	3389660	Activision Blizzard Microsoft acquisition story, it just never is going to end or it keeps
3389660	3396540	delivering, it keeps delivering something. Well, in the UK, we have an update now the competitive
3397580	3404540	the competition and markets authority has announced that provisional findings that
3404540	3410380	basically said that this would threaten competition in the gaming market. If this
3410380	3417580	acquisition were to go ahead. They're saying that right now, Xbox and PlayStation complete
3417580	3423020	or compete closely with each other at present and access to the most important content like
3423020	3428060	Call of Duty is an important part of that competition. Reducing this competition between
3428060	3433980	Microsoft and Sony could result in all gamers seen higher prices, reduced range, lower quality
3433980	3441100	and worse service in gaming consoles over time. All of those things already exist. Exactly. And
3441740	3446380	all of those things already exist. This is once when you get basically somebody that's talking
3446380	3450460	about an industry they don't understand they make comments like this and it's kind of annoying.
3450460	3455500	However, they are also taking public comment on this kind of gets like that.
3455500	3464620	SCC, I think does this as well. So they're going to basically give consumer or have solicit
3464620	3471420	consumer feedback until they have March 1, I guess the file or Activision Blizzard Microsoft
3471420	3477660	have March 1 to file the rebuttals. And the final report will be issued on April 26.
3478220	3485820	Um, one of the suggestions that CMA made was that they should perhaps break up Activision Blizzard
3485820	3492620	in order for that to go ahead. So maybe like only purchasing one portion of it. Yeah, but then if
3492620	3498700	like they purchase Activision, which has Call of Duty, we're still the same scenario here. Like,
3498700	3501900	I don't know, I don't see how that's really gonna help. And you know, if they want to split the
3501900	3507180	company, how about we take Microsoft can get Activision Blizzard, and Bobby Kotick can get
3507260	3513900	the hell out of here. Yeah, that's my suggestion. Yes, that's split Bobby Kotick for the rest of
3513900	3519980	Activision. I think that's a great idea. Did you like see what he's been doing? Like his idea of
3519980	3525340	like, trying to move the thing forward is, I know this is going to come as a surprise considering
3525340	3532460	his past behavior, but making threats that that that's that's the thing that he's done threatening,
3532460	3537580	you know, different countries with saying that it's gonna be a war or something like that. It's
3537580	3546220	like, shut the hell up, dude. Like, can we just have him? I don't know. Can he choke on a pretzel
3546220	3550700	or something? Like, I don't know, like, just get out of the public eye for a while. Can someone
3550700	3555900	put them in a balloon? Go away. Send them to Oz, let them be their problem.
3555900	3561900	I want to go right on a Chinese balloon. Is that
3563020	3567340	I didn't I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth. I said, okay, like,
3567340	3573420	I'm sorry, a nice hot air balloon, like, right on a weather balloon that will go off course.
3574860	3582780	Conveniently, even though we have multiple, if not dozens of weather balloons that are off course,
3582780	3591020	but yeah. Anyway, yeah, Bobby Kotick needs to go and that's why it's very important that
3591020	3596140	something happens with this merger and it does move forward and I on I'm going to be honest,
3596700	3601900	I hope that if they do split Activision Blizzard, I hope Microsoft has taken the Blizzard part,
3602620	3606780	even though they probably do want the Activision part because of Call of Duty. I just think
3606780	3614620	Blizzard I just I like Blizzard games enough where I want them to be free from the clutches
3614620	3619740	of Bobby Kotick Activision, I can cut my losses. That's that's what it really boils down to is a
3619740	3627900	fucking selfish one. As Joe and Matt says, if the deal falls through, there's no chance the board
3627900	3633500	lets him stick around. They're gonna put someone to help facilitate a sale. God, I hope you're
3633980	3643020	right. I want to believe I sure do. All right. Well, moving on and speaking of other acquisitions,
3643020	3648700	this one actually did go through and it's meta or Facebook, you know, that company has
3649580	3656380	finished their acquisition of the company within. Now this was one that was also a little bit hotly
3656380	3661660	contested as well because the FTC or Federal Trade Commission had filed an antitrust suit
3661660	3668140	to block this deal in July of 2022. Saying that meta was using this to basically dominate the VR
3668140	3675020	space because they had also acquired Beat Saber's creator beat games. Meta delayed the acquisition
3675020	3680540	to provide more time and a federal court denied the preliminary injunction to block the merger
3680540	3686940	while the FTC investigated and then the commission decided to not to appeal the loss and so on and so
3686940	3694300	on. So basically, meta now controls the company within. What the hell does within do? They make
3694300	3701900	VR fitness apps. This is the interesting part of this for me. I actually think this makes a lot of
3701900	3709100	sense for Facebook meta whatever to acquire this company in particular, because I think fitness
3709100	3718460	apps, they can attract audiences to a console, if you will, although I know, you know, the meta
3718460	3725580	quest, Oculus quest, whatever is not a traditional console. But, you know, my mind goes to Wii Fit
3725580	3732220	and how well that did on the Wii. How well exercising became for connect and getting
3732220	3739420	people moving there. I think especially again, if meta actually markets this to their Facebook users
3740220	3745020	as you know, the fitness apps and so forth. I think this could be a very smart move for them.
3745020	3749820	Although I think I don't think metas marketing the their quest very well on their own platforms,
3749820	3754700	but you know, it is what it is. But it's gonna be interesting to see what develops.
3756700	3760300	Yeah, oh, no, I have no I have no plans and getting a meta quest. But you know,
3760300	3766380	I'm just kind of talking from like a perspective of what might do well for them. The only thing
3766380	3772140	though, that I can also see just from feeling like we've been down this road before since I brought
3772140	3779900	up connect, why did connect kind of die off, it really was not able to prove itself beyond
3779900	3785820	dance games and fitness games. There's very few games we ever got that weren't dance games and
3785820	3793260	fitness games. Well, what is meta buying up? The biggest dance game of sorts? I know Beat Saber is
3793260	3797660	not specifically a dance game, but come on roll with me. You know, it's Jason. Yeah, and now
3797660	3803980	fitness. So meta making the same mistake. I don't know if they're making the same mistake. They're
3803980	3811660	trying I think what they're struggling with right now is making money. Well, yes. I mean, yes,
3811660	3817420	that's basically what it comes down to. But they have a captive audience on their own. They have
3817420	3823340	an audience of Oh, no, I'd say it's captive audience. Okay, captive audience. Okay, captive
3823340	3831580	audience of, shall we say, older individuals, they use their product Facebook. And how do we market
3831580	3840860	to these people? A product that costs $300 is basically like, you know, they don't understand.
3842060	3848700	Fitness. Hey, hey, hey, did you? Did you become a fat ass during you know, the pandemic?
3849260	3854540	We got it. We got a solution for you. It makes you know, because fitness is, you know, really
3854540	3858940	boring. And no one wants to do that. It's not fun at all. But what if it were a game? Well, we can
3858940	3866220	make it into a game. And that's what they want to do with it. And I mean, yeah, that is it is
3866220	3870460	motivating for people. Like if you want to do that, it is a good way to sell it. And honestly,
3870460	3879660	like with Facebook and stuff. I see so many ads for fitness apps for the meta quest,
3880620	3885420	which is weird. And I'm like, try stop trying to sell me the meta quest. I already own one. Like I
3885420	3888860	don't need more ads for that. Like that's the other thing they just don't understand. But
3889900	3896060	but yeah, it is fitness apps. And to the point, Beat Saber, that's also kind of a fitness app,
3896060	3900540	if you will, because it is moving quite a bit. And so I think that is going to be
3901420	3904460	their angle that they're pushing to try to get people into the meta quest.
3904460	3911180	Well, what meta needs to do to do that, and I'm shocked that they don't again, this is where I'm
3911180	3917340	like, meta is not a well run company. And we all know the guy at the head of it is just the wrong
3917340	3923180	person for this job. He's a kid that got lucky. He's Yeah, it's just, but here's the thing. Let
3923180	3926620	me let me finish my thought because honestly, it does not take up rocket scientists to figure out
3926620	3934460	the best way to market fitness on the meta quest would be to actually publish in Facebook feeds.
3934460	3937500	Because you know, obviously, it would all be opt in, and it wouldn't share anything you didn't
3937500	3942780	want to share, but have it be very easily shareable to brag to all of your friends,
3942780	3946860	all of the other Karen's in your Facebook circle, because we know that's a big crowd that's on
3946860	3954220	Facebook is, you know, sharing pictures of children of cats of dinner. And oh, look,
3954220	3961500	I lost five pounds this month using the meta fitness program. And it's right. And then that
3961500	3966940	way all the other Karen's can be like, Oh, that's, I gotta try this out. This is what you're doing.
3966940	3973820	That seems really cool. You know, like, that's, that's what meta is not doing. That blows my
3973820	3980540	fucking mind. They have the easiest advertising mechanism. So I have no idea what they're doing.
3980540	3986140	It's it's honestly no different from when you left in many ways. Yeah, the good and the bad.
3986700	3992140	It's I mean, honestly, like my kids have quest twos, and they're pretty nice pieces of kit,
3992140	3999660	like it really is like a decent VR headset. And like, I have no problem with like the software
3999660	4003660	and stuff that they have on it. And like fitness apps are great, too. I think it's a good good way
4003660	4009180	to get people to exercise, especially my kids, you know, who don't go out as I mean, they go
4009180	4014700	to school, but they don't go out and play or run around or anything like that. They stay at home
4014700	4022620	and play games. So at least they're moving. Somewhat they're not vigorously moving, but
4022620	4028860	they're, you know, they're not sitting completely still. Right. So it's, it's something but like,
4028860	4034300	and I think it is something to be they just haven't quite figured out how to game a fight
4034300	4038620	enough to get people excited about, like, get people excited about it, like they got excited
4038620	4044940	about Pokemon Go, something like that, where it's like very much like, engaging, you know, this is,
4044940	4050060	you know, more of just like fitness stuff. It's not, they need to figure out a way to really like
4050060	4055180	gamify that somehow even more than they're doing now. Well, they if you want to see who's winning
4055180	4061420	in that space, look at Peloton for as expensive as expensive as that whole thing is. That's the
4061420	4069100	thing that actually, that's Peloton is doing exactly what I'm saying meta should be doing,
4069100	4075740	because Peloton made it very easy to share on Instagram on things like I did the Spice Girls
4075740	4081980	bike ride with, you know, so and so and I burned this many calories, this this, like that. Peloton
4081980	4088300	is a huge example of like, who is gamifying in a sense, fitness, and getting people's attention
4088300	4093180	huge. And they may not have Pokemon, but they have some huge personalities on that platform
4093180	4097660	that you know, people like I have a friend that is super like always like, every time I see her,
4097660	4101740	she's like, when are you getting a peloton and I'm like, they're expensive. I don't know if you're
4101740	4106860	aware and I need more room in my house. Like I'm not really set up for that type of thing. But it's
4106860	4113420	you know, they've got some real star trainers on there or whatever that you know, are really
4114060	4118540	big personalities and people get excited for the new specials. It's like Richard Simmons or some
4118540	4123500	shit although nobody will ever be Richard Simmons. Let's make that clear. I'll be perfectly honest,
4123500	4130540	the whole I the whole thought of Peloton and VR exercise does not appeal to me.
4131500	4132220	No, I get it.
4132780	4141260	Yeah, it's it's like it's another layer of why when I like things to be quiet and solitary
4141260	4145100	when I'm, you know, sweating profusely and lifting heavy things.
4147100	4153100	No, I get it. I get it. But yeah, if Facebook doesn't figure out how to gamify this thing or
4153100	4157740	get more like sharing and bragging and that sort of thing. I just think this is a lost cause and
4157740	4163020	they're just burning more money. But we'll see. We'll see. All right, well, moving on Dark Sakura.
4164380	4170540	So now you know that I like to take the the other angles of video games, you know,
4171260	4181900	and so I came across an article of a neuroscience study that was published from the University of
4181900	4191260	Houston where they did a study to see if playing video games would cause harm to young children's
4191260	4197980	cognitive abilities and the study and I'll just read the quote. Our studies turned up no such
4197980	4202380	links regardless of how long the children played and what types of games they chose.
4202380	4208460	And that's from Zhi Zhang, the associate professor of curriculum and instruction at the University
4208460	4213340	of Houston College of Education, who's also on the research team. It was published in the Journal
4213340	4221980	of Media Psychology. They examined the video game habits of 160 diverse urban public school preteens,
4222540	4232220	70 percent from lower income households that represented a group that hadn't been studied
4232220	4239340	in earlier research. And so they reported them playing video games an average of two and a half
4239340	4245340	hours a day. The heaviest ones were four and a half hours a day. And they looked for association
4245340	4252780	between their games that they were playing and how much they were playing and their performance
4252780	4259500	on the standardized cognitive ability test seven, the CogAt. It evaluates verbal quantitative and
4259500	4266140	nonverbal spatial skills. So every everyone took the same test. Everyone went through the same
4266140	4273420	study. And basically there was no link found, which I mean, we all could have told you.
4274220	4284860	But having it in writing backed up by science, that's a big thing. You know, so now when parents
4284860	4289980	say, oh, those video games are going to rot your brain, say, actually, psychologists said no.
4289980	4298620	There's no link. Here's the study. Shut up. But yeah, I mean, so basically they the one thing
4298620	4307820	that they were cautioning about is that more time spending games without doing other productive
4307820	4314140	activities would cause what they're calling cognitive displacement.
4315100	4323020	But, you know, but for students who have, you know, who spend a reasonable time playing their
4323020	4329340	games and they also do their homework and do other stuff, you know, that's fine. They just
4329340	4334620	say the thing to watch out for is obsessive behavior, because then that's a sign of addictive
4334620	4344780	personalities and that. And Bonds006, you apparently didn't hear me just say the same
4344780	4356700	things. So I basically did just say too much would, you know, would be causing a negative
4356700	4361660	effect, especially to the exclusion of other things. Too much of anything is going to do that,
4361660	4370060	right? So exactly, exactly. You know, you could have a kid that's into the Bible model cars and
4370060	4377740	does nothing but model cars. Right. And, you know, that's going to be just as detrimental as spending,
4377740	4384380	you know, five plus hours a day playing a game instead of doing their homework or socializing,
4384380	4392540	you know. So it's all going to be, you know, it's still going to be up to a responsible parent to
4393740	4402140	limit what their kids are doing. And this is me as, you know, a gamer now. For me,
4403100	4409580	I could play games all night at my house and then do my homework before school that day,
4410300	4419660	you know. So it's all also a matter of, you know, how the kids brains are wired, you know, how,
4419660	4424220	you know, their learning styles. I mean, it's not going that deep into it. It's just doing
4424220	4426940	basic cognition, but there was no link found.
4430540	4437340	All right. Well, no more of this. We have science to back up the facts that video games do not
4437340	4441740	rot your brain. But of course, you know, there's so many people out there that continue to deny
4441740	4446860	science anyway. I'm sure this will go nowhere. One other thing, too, is that they even tested
4446860	4451980	games that were described as helping children build cognitive skills, and they still presented
4451980	4459900	no measurable effects. So basically, I mean, it didn't say anything about, you know, games for
4459900	4466300	therapy. But Yeah, the brain building games, at least for kids also have no effect.
4466300	4469820	So Nintendo brain training is not the miracle tool. It's
4469820	4471020	I don't think that that's to be.
4471660	4473900	I don't think that that's marketed to kids.
4473900	4477100	That's true. No, it isn't. It isn't. Yeah. Only gullible adults. All right.
4479020	4483420	Quest Buster in chat says one thing I've noticed is that some of the streamers I've been watching
4483420	4488060	that do long sessions have adopted standing desks just for their own health.
4488060	4491020	Yeah, you kind of have to do that.
4491020	4493580	Well, you know, we have that at my work.
4494140	4498860	Now with more and more streamers, like kind of running ads, because Twitch really encourages
4498860	4503260	you to do like the what is it three minutes an hour or whatever it is. Like, I think there's a
4503260	4508380	lot to be said instead of letting the ads intentionally interrupted or like accidentally
4508380	4514060	or whatever, like just air whenever they're going to air. Take an intentional three minute break
4514060	4519340	every hour. Yeah. Take it to like, I'm going to do a bio. I'm going to, you know, just walk around
4519340	4523900	the house real quick. Just get up and stretch. And I encourage all of my viewers to do the same
4523900	4526220	and we'll be right back at the top of the hour or something like that.
4526220	4530860	Technically every 30 minutes, because that's when my timer runs up.
4530860	4535260	Right. And like, if I'm starting like a match, I might do like a 30 second
4535260	4538140	ad so that no one gets an ad during the middle of my match.
4538140	4545980	But for me, especially given that, you know, I have myalgic encephalomyelitis,
4546620	4552940	you know, I have to take those breaks. And so for me, having I mean, I hate the ads,
4552940	4557580	don't get me wrong. I hate them. I've tried to point out because I'm also doing like the
4557580	4564620	Twitch research thing that I've left feedback that you have a significant drop in viewership
4564700	4569340	every time an ad comes on, which basically means no one's actually watching the ads anyway.
4569340	4576700	Right. But back to what I was saying is that I use that countdown as my benchmark to get
4576700	4583580	up every 30 minutes and at least move around, whether it's, you know, walking to go to the
4583580	4588860	bathroom or get myself a drink or, you know, harassing Midna, you know, bringing her in to
4588860	4596540	put her on cat cam, you know, it's still I've been actually even leaving that advice to other
4596540	4600940	streamer friends of mine, use that as your personal break, reset yourself.
4600940	4604540	I heard a really good tip at work that kind of stuck with me. It was really because, you know,
4604540	4609420	we love those little catchy sayings. And it was the 20-20-20 rule. And that's every 20 minutes,
4609420	4613660	take a 20 second break to look 20 feet away. And I thought that was an interesting little
4614620	4615740	way, at least for your eyes.
4615740	4621580	Yeah, that's been around at my at my office too. In fact, our ergo team is pretty,
4622620	4627340	pretty big on it. But of course, you know, if you're elbow deep in fixing stuff,
4627340	4627900	Right.
4627900	4628780	It's a little different.
4630140	4635980	All right, let's move on to our next story and talk about some of those games that you can keep
4635980	4639500	your keep your cognitive abilities up with in the future. Right, Logie?
4640140	4648060	Well, maybe not that but, you know, I guess they, Nintendo wants you to know that
4649180	4655100	we're still developing games for the switch. I mean, I kind of thought that was a given since
4655100	4658860	Well, we don't have this is conveniently timed with the news about Nintendo is not doing
4658860	4661100	anything for the holidays. I think that's what this boils down to.
4661900	4665260	We'll see about that. Like, I don't know. But yeah, basically saying that they are still
4666140	4672380	developing stuff for the switch is as you know, that the switch is coming up on its seventh year
4672380	4679420	of sales in March. And they said that this is uncharted territory in the history of our dedicated
4679420	4684140	video game platforms. Under these circumstances, it's hard to imagine that hardware sales will
4684140	4688700	continue to grow at the same pace they have to date. However, there are titles under development
4688700	4693180	for Nintendo switch and new titles that will continue to be proposed going forward. We are
4693260	4699500	seeing both new demand and multiple system demand for hardware. So we think that there is still room
4699500	4703420	for growth in sales to that. And we want to maintain a high level of engagement with the
4703420	4710380	hardware and create new demand by not or not only by releasing new titles, but also by working to
4710380	4714700	further convey the appeal of existing titles. In other words, drip feeding the stuff that they will
4714700	4721020	have in development, I guess well, and keeping Mario Kart eight fresh the way they are with all
4721020	4724700	of these, you know, now it's there is new tracks, you know, I think when they originally announced
4724700	4728620	this, it was supposed to not be completely brand new tracks. Well, it seems like each piece of
4728620	4732940	DLC has had at least one new track, and now a new character. That was not something they talked
4732940	4738140	about in the beginning. But apparently, if you go read deep in the press release, this is not the
4738140	4741660	they are planning on doing other new characters too. This is not just going to be Birdo,
4741660	4747020	there will be at least one more in the upcoming packs. So yeah, that'd be cool. Yeah.
4747020	4754620	So um, yeah, of course, Nintendo still develop if they're not, they're never going to clue on
4754620	4759180	that they're like, you know, developing for a new system or whatever. And even then you would you
4759180	4765740	would hope you'd hope although I feel like this isn't the case more than it is these days, but
4765740	4769340	you would hope the new system will be backwards compatible with the current switch titles.
4770060	4778220	At least the digital ones if not the hardware, but we'll see. Anyhow, speaking of the Nintendo switch
4778220	4783340	and some of the big news going on on that front, obviously, we kind of brushed this topic a little
4783340	4788460	bit earlier in the show, we talked about the new Zelda game. But Nintendo did unveil the
4788460	4796460	officially that the new Zelda game will have a $70 price tag. However, that has caused the question
4796540	4799740	to be asked does this mean all Nintendo games moving forward are going to be $70.
4800540	4805820	So Game Informer actually went to go ask Nintendo and reach out to Nintendo and Nintendo provided
4805820	4813020	the following response. We determine the suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case
4813020	4818620	by case basis, and then asked if this is going to be the trend going forward. We determine the
4818620	4824060	suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case by case basis. And the headline with
4824140	4827500	this article is that this is not going to be the trend moving forward.
4829260	4835420	I actually think this is the opposite. Even though this is the headline people are writing about
4835420	4841100	this, those quotes lead me to say, Oh, no, if Nintendo's determining it on a case by case basis,
4841100	4846460	that means nope, your Zeldas, your Marios, the things they know are going to move units,
4846460	4853020	the next Animal Crossing game absolutely will be $70. The things that will not be $70, Pikmin 4,
4853740	4859900	things that are a little more unproven, which is weird to say that about a franchise like Pikmin,
4859900	4863820	but I feel like if they tried to charge 70 for Pikmin, they would really pay for it.
4865100	4869100	Something has mass appeal. I mean, it has like appeal, but it's not like, you know,
4869820	4872140	a must must must have game right.
4874140	4879260	Mike Deaf says I wonder if the long development on on Tears of the Kingdom is what makes it $70.
4879740	4884220	US? Well, I mean, we know that the developers are getting pay raises. But I think this is where
4884220	4890700	everybody feels burned, is that we were to some extent, not everybody, but we were willing to
4890700	4896540	write off the $70 because the cost of developing games, especially for 4k, and the newer hardware
4896540	4901660	is getting more expensive. It was always an excuse. It was always an excuse. Like I knew
4901660	4905500	Yeah, to see Nintendo do it as like, but you don't have the hardware to justify that same thing.
4906140	4911420	And like in certain circumstances, like say like they are going to charge $70 for a Pokemon game.
4911420	4915660	Do you think that last Pokemon game is worth $70? Do you think that really was like
4915660	4921980	a title that was polished to the point of a $70 game? Because like, like I said,
4921980	4927900	when I see a $70 price point, I expect that game to be perfect. Like, perfect. Yeah,
4927900	4933500	I expect it to be as polished as polished can be. It should be a standout example of
4933500	4938940	what a game on that platform should aspire to. Yeah. And if it's nothing less than that,
4938940	4944780	it does not deserve $70. And don't get me wrong tears of the kingdom. Sure, it's gonna be a
4944780	4949020	fantastic game. Is that going to be the same for every other Nintendo game is put out there?
4949900	4954220	I don't know. Like, I just feel that if you're going to raise the price,
4954220	4958060	and you're going to make all the excuses, well, it's inflation, it's this and that.
4958060	4965980	Okay, well, I'm sorry, but like, you know, you can't just keep showing up the same unfinished
4965980	4971260	stuff for $70. And I'm not saying Nintendo is doing that. But you know, some other game
4971260	4976380	franchises that may not necessarily be Nintendo directly, but it is definitely associated with
4976380	4983100	Nintendo. Ain't looking so hot recently. Going to chat, there's several people that are bringing up
4983100	4986380	the vouchers. So let's talk about that for a minute, because it is a little bit of a
4986380	4990620	game changer with this specific title. So e3 v l and chat says they're pushing digital with
4990620	4995500	their voucher promo. And SSG 100. Matt says considering Nintendo never discounts their own
4995500	5001100	games. The digital voucher is really nice deal if things are going to be $70. So yeah, let's talk
5001100	5004780	about the vouchers for a minute. So if you weren't already aware, I think most of you are but just to
5004780	5009900	recap, Nintendo is currently selling I think you have to be a switch online member to get it. So
5009900	5015420	there's that too. But if you're a switch online member, you can get a $100 you buy it for $100.
5016220	5022300	And it's good for two games. So essentially, on the list, because I don't think all third party
5022300	5026860	games are on the list. But most of the first party stuff generally is there was a big question when
5026860	5032300	this was announced will Zelda Tears of the Kingdom be on the list and it turns out Yes, it is. So
5032300	5039420	there is a way you can get this game for $50. However, you have to commit to buying another game
5039420	5046700	for $50. The voucher is good for a year. The only problem I have with the voucher is I don't know
5046700	5054140	what other game to get with it. Because I already bought things like Pokemon Scarlet and things that
5054140	5058780	you know are on like a lot of them are titles that already exist. I don't know if Nintendo's
5058780	5065340	announced anything else on the voucher that I would want to use this on. So I'm kind of hoping
5065340	5070780	that there's a holiday release or something else I can use the voucher later on that will justify
5070780	5077580	the $50. You know what I mean? So yes, the voucher is a good way to quote unquote, save money because
5077580	5082940	you know, you'd be paying 50. So you get saved $20 on Zelda, and then $10 and some other title.
5082940	5087420	But then also, yes, you need to remember to you'd be owning the games digitally,
5087420	5094060	which means after you've spent 100 hours on Zelda, you can't sell it used. That won't be possible.
5094060	5099180	Although, to be fair, when it comes to Zelda, I don't think a lot of people sell that one back. I
5099180	5102300	mean, some people do, of course, there's always going to be the people that need money and getting
5102300	5105420	hard times and so forth. It's going to sell it ever.
5106380	5109500	Like, let's look at it this way. It depends. Because let's say for example,
5110300	5117740	that you buy Tears of the Kingdom, and say another game later in the year. And then they announce,
5117740	5121820	Oh, hey, Switch Two is coming out in 2024. And it's gonna have Tears of the Kingdom in it again.
5121820	5126940	And so you're going to upgrade because you want that brand new Switch, but you still love Zelda,
5126940	5130860	so you're going to buy it again. You can't sell the old one because it's stuck on your
5130860	5135980	system digitally. Some people have no problem paying twice for a game. But like, I think that
5135980	5141740	that's a very realistic scenario. I don't think Nintendo will fuck people that hard. I actually
5141740	5144140	I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't think they're gonna fuck people that hard.
5144140	5149900	But I, Loki, I will meet you halfway. What I do think they will do is they will borrow something
5149900	5154380	I think is being done on the PlayStation front. And there will be like a $10 upgrade pass
5154380	5159180	to allow your digital license to move to that old box to each other. Because remember,
5159180	5164060	Nintendo is operating in the internet of 10 years ago. And so yeah, you know,
5164060	5169420	it also depends on how grossly different the technology is. Because I mean, look at how
5169420	5175580	different the Wii U was versus your Switch. I had Breath of the Wild on both of them. Of course,
5175580	5178860	I won my Switch and my Breath of the Wild, but still that's besides the point.
5179500	5183580	Yeah, fair enough. That we're assuming the technology will be similar just because the
5183580	5187660	Switch is sold a lot. Well, the Wii sold a lot and they still mixed up the technology.
5187660	5192460	Of course, Nintendo paid a price for that. So maybe this time that maybe we're thinking that
5192460	5196220	next time they don't make the same mistake, but we don't we don't know what they could be doing. So
5196220	5203260	we won't know until they unveil it. So we'll see. We'll see. All right. Yeah. As Joe on a map
5203260	5207660	follows up the problem I have Nintendo is not great with game preservation. You can get the
5207660	5211660	game now. But how about when they shut down the store space, you can't download the game again,
5211660	5215980	at least with physical, you got something in hand digital, who knows if you'll own it forever.
5215980	5220460	No, that's, that's really a risk on any storefront right now, for sure. Who knows,
5220460	5224380	we'll just take it down and never put it back up again. It's where a lot of things are going
5224380	5230060	Mario 100 or whatever that was. It's also why I like game pass because I feel like by paying the
5230060	5235660	monthly fee to access it, I'm not having that same investment. I don't know. I maybe I just
5235660	5239340	wish Nintendo would have a game pass type system. But then I say that and then I feel like when they
5239340	5245420	do it, I'll hate it. Because they do have game passes called Nintendo online expansion. You get
5245420	5251820	a game pass to Nintendo games and Sega games and Gameboy games. Perfect example because this is
5251820	5256300	what everybody wanted Nintendo to do is to do the Netflix style thing for their old catalog.
5256300	5261340	They're doing it and now we're all like, this is not good because there's their drip feeding.
5261340	5267020	There's too many gaps in the system. They wanted to do it when the catalog was vast,
5267020	5272860	and there was like a huge library of virtual console games. And they're like, $10 per game
5272860	5277980	is too much. You know, can we please like, do like a Netflix style thing? And they're like,
5277980	5280460	yeah, you can do that. But we're only gonna give you five of those games.
5280460	5288060	Nintendo is doing a fully immersed Netflix model by canceling all of the games that people enjoy
5288860	5294540	and removing them from the service that Nintendo is just doing the fully immersed Netflix model.
5294540	5299420	It's fine. You can just go collect the original heart. Oh, wait. Yeah, speculation bubbles and
5299420	5304380	all that stuff. Oh, well, that sucks. Guess you're just screwed all. I guess there's no other way to
5304380	5309900	play games nowadays in the modern era. It's not like we can just download them and play them on
5309900	5315660	our computers or anything. Oh, well, I guess we'll just have to make do with not doing any of that.
5315820	5320620	Let's talk about an extremely cost effective solution. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
5321900	5329420	Well, um, you know, there's a classic series that Konami is is kind of known for that we don't
5329420	5338060	really get to see much of outside of of Japan. And that's the Jiko powerful pro Yaku series.
5338060	5343740	It started off on Super Famicom back in 1994. It's a cute little TV baseball game. I've played
5343740	5348140	a few of them. They're, they're, they're cute. They're some of the ones I actually like. And
5348140	5355260	Konami is, I guess, trying to make it available for everybody, you know, in Japan, outside Japan,
5355260	5361260	you name it. So on Nintendo's website, the game's a dollar. It's actually also for PS4, also a
5361260	5368380	dollar. So it's, it's, it's a full game. I mean, I always thought that they were the cutest little
5368380	5376060	series that had sort of this like pseudo 3d ish thing back in 94. They look like pop dolls playing
5376060	5381980	baseball. They're cuter. Um, but I mean, but like their first time they tried to bring it out was
5381980	5390300	MLB power pros on the Wii and PS2. It added basically like a Major League Baseball license
5390300	5398300	on it. And it was cute. There was a, a follow up the next year, but it didn't really stick. So
5398300	5404700	they're actually bringing it out as WBS CE baseball power pros over here in the US. And I
5404700	5408140	mean, they're, they're fun. If you like baseball games, I mean, there's a buck. I had the points
5408140	5414140	for it. I paid Nintendo points. Yeah. And got it. And they're solid little fun games. Yeah.
5415740	5421420	All right. Really popular in Japan. Yeah, they are. Mike Defton chat says for a dollar,
5421420	5426220	you can't go wrong. Well, I mean, there are, there are bad ways to spend a dollar. Let's be clear,
5426220	5430620	but it doesn't sound like this is one of them. So it's good. It's, it's worth it. Honestly,
5430620	5436060	it's worth it. It's worth the, I mean, I'm not, like I said, I used points that I had
5436060	5440780	leftover after buying radiant silver garden and a few other things. Smart way to do that. Yeah.
5440780	5445020	All right. Uh, let's move on just a couple more stories and we will get to our classic
5445020	5451180	segment tonight. So let's do Loki story. Yes, this is kind of interesting. So team
5451180	5457500	fortress two is going to be getting an update soon. So they apparently have updated their very
5457500	5464220	not updated website for the game that, um, basically put out a blog post saying that, Hey,
5465180	5472380	can you believe it? It's a blog post and that they have an unnamed update or a full on the well,
5472380	5477420	let me put it in their exact words. They're planning on shipping a full on update sized
5477420	5484300	update with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, uh, war paint and who knows what else,
5485180	5491500	but they are seeking people's, uh, steam workshop content to, I guess, populate this update or at
5491500	5498220	least to go along with it. I don't think so. It doesn't mention anything. Maybe they are,
5498220	5502220	I don't know what the deal is. They're just saying make steam workshop content.
5503100	5510140	Uh, and then they're going to be, uh, taking submissions until I think, what was it? May 1st.
5510140	5518380	Yeah. May 1st to be considered for that unnamed, unthemed, still very exciting summer situated,
5519420	5527100	uh, update. I mean, it's cool, but yeah, the, the, I don't know what, you know,
5527980	5535740	payments they're talking about. Well, steam workshop, generally mods that are good. Uh,
5535740	5540060	generally, uh, let's talk about some mods that are bad. And I think I touched on this a little
5540060	5545660	bit last week, but we kind of had an update on this story. So final fantasy 14 had a mod, uh,
5545660	5550700	that were, that folks were using. It was something called G shade. Uh, I don't use it. I, you know,
5550700	5554780	I play a ton of Final Fantasy 14. I don't use mods and that's not just me putting on a front
5554780	5558700	for the show. Like I would, I would make a tongue in cheek joke or something. If I did,
5558700	5563980	I can say I use mods with world Warcraft, which, you know, is a different environment. Um,
5563980	5568780	you know, unplayable without mods. Yeah. For, for serious, for serious. Um, and even though I,
5568780	5573260	I finally let the wow subscription lapse and then back on fantasy 14, I don't use mods with 14. I
5573260	5577580	think the interface is plenty customizable. There's a lot you can do with it. I never did.
5577580	5583980	Um, but G shade, uh, allowed you to alter aesthetics without altering gameplay. So I think
5583980	5589260	it was just, uh, allowing the graphics to really pop that much more and so forth. So, um, folks
5589260	5595340	were using this. However, some leaked discord messages from the developer of G shade Marat
5595340	5602380	Sutil revealed that malware was deliberately put in the mod code. It could force your computer to
5602380	5608300	shut down. If the files were accessed by a third part of the application, supposedly this was all
5608300	5614220	to teach a lesson about mod use. Mods had been hotly contested in the final fantasy 14 community.
5614220	5618140	Uh, you know, there was a different one. It wasn't for graphics, but it was like, uh, I think it
5618140	5623020	allowed you to see, it allowed your distance to be greater. You could see more of the battlefield
5623020	5628220	and stuff. I think that's what it was. And some Raiders had used this and they got a world first
5628220	5634060	clear. And now Kiyoshita came in and said, the fuck you are getting that clear and strip them
5634060	5638940	of the titles because they used a game enhancing mod to do it with basically the equivalent of
5638940	5642540	taking somebody's Olympic medal. Cause they use performance enhancing drugs. It's basically what
5642540	5650140	they did. And now she'd awarded a very strong letter to those folks. So, you know, he's probably,
5650140	5654460	I mean, on one hand, he's probably frustrated that, you know, this, this is going along with
5654460	5658300	his game when it's a mod he had nothing to do with. But on the other hand, he's probably sitting
5658300	5664460	up there going, I fucking told you not to use mods that you have no one to blame, but yourself,
5664460	5669580	you have no one to blame, but yourself up there. I'm just assuming OCP is just like dad or
5669580	5674060	something. I don't know. But anyway, uh, the lesson that was trying to be taught, uh, by the
5674060	5679020	developer, this was meant to be a lesson to use specifically about taking this approach to the
5679020	5683420	problem. Anything could have been in the payload and you'd have been responsible for distributing
5683420	5691100	it to people and triggering it. Okay. Apparently the developer is getting an ass whooping for this,
5691100	5696940	uh, metaphorically, uh, he's been banned from a big fantasy 14 discord. A statement on the
5696940	5703020	game subreddit has called out G shade. I guess the Reddit was actually kind of endorsing it.
5703020	5707020	And that makes them look a little silly. Oops. I use the Reddit quite often, not for
5707740	5712700	mod tools, but they have a great Island sanctuary guide for people that get into that mode,
5712700	5718860	which I am one of them. So anyway, uh, get hub investigated and G shade has been removed
5718860	5726620	from the hosting service, uh, in a tweet that was written by cabs corner. So the G shade stuff
5726620	5732220	has a new development. G shade is fucking dead. The get hub is gone following a get hub
5732220	5737900	investigation, which means that all current unmodified installs of G shade are bricked.
5737900	5744700	I like that. We need more news reported like that. You know, this mod is fucking dead.
5747260	5753340	All right. Well, something that is not dead and lives on and on and on is something that
5753340	5757020	is going to be featured in our next segment. So let's get to the bumper.
5767980	5773180	Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull
5773180	5778140	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5780380	5787500	But in a twist, uh, dark soccer once a month, uh, likes to pick, I believe this year's twist
5787500	5793180	is called the non game game. So going to pick something a little bit different classic game of
5793420	5798060	the non video game classic game. That's right. So what did you pick tonight for the,
5798060	5801340	uh, the game that isn't a video game? Jenga.
5804780	5810060	Um, and, and the video I have is actually from like one of the Django world championships.
5810060	5816780	I can't believe world championship. That's great. Of course there is. Um, so anyway, uh,
5816780	5828460	Jenga, uh, first came out in 1983, so 40 years ago, and it's a game you can play solo or with
5828460	5838220	a crowd, you know, it comes in all sizes and colors and themes and stuff. Um, but it is a
5838220	5843580	game of physical skill that was created by a British board game designer and author,
5843580	5849580	Leslie Scott. It was marketed by Hasbro and basically the players take turns moving one
5849580	5857340	block at a time from a tower made of 54 blocks. Each block is then removed and placed on top of
5857340	5865420	the tower. And so the structure gets more and more unstable. Um, so to go a little bit about
5865420	5870620	Leslie Scott, first of all, which I just think is fascinating is she was born in Tanzania,
5871260	5880220	educated in Uganda, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and then in England in Taunton. Um, but she is
5880220	5885500	the one who, uh, invented Jenga, which was launched at the London toy fair in 1983. She
5885500	5892300	founded Oxford gains limited in 91 and is a senior associate of Pembroke college, Oxford,
5892300	5899660	and a founding trustee of the Smithsonian UK charitable trust. So, uh, she also won the 2010
5899740	5905900	wonder women of toys, uh, inventor designer award and the 2012 taggy award for excellence in game
5905900	5915180	design. So, you know, just going back, this is a game created by a woman. Anyway, sorry about the,
5915180	5923900	the hacking. Each of the blocks is three times as long as it's wide. Um, and one fifth as thick as
5923900	5931340	its length. So it's 1.5 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters by 7.5 centimeters. Um,
5933020	5939900	they have little variations from the dimensions to make the, uh, some imperfections to add to
5939900	5945820	the challenge of the game. So yes, if someone accuses a block of being like a particular size
5945820	5952380	or having a favorite block, they're not, they're not hallucinating. So to start each of the blocks
5952380	5959660	are stacked into a solid rectangular tower of 18 layers, three blocks per layer. Each, uh, turned,
5959660	5967500	uh, each layer is oriented, uh, either based on your perspective vertically or horizontally,
5967500	5973100	you know, well, they're laid horizontally, but they're alternating directions. Um, so starting
5973100	5978460	with the one who built the tower, the players will take turns, removing a block from any level below
5978460	5985740	the highest and place it on top of the tower, uh, perpendicular to any blocks on the previous layer.
5985740	5994700	So, um, once, uh, a level contains three blocks, it's, uh, complete and can't have anything else
5994700	6001100	added to it, but you can remove, of course, things from the, the lower layers as long as it's not the
6001100	6010220	top layer. And the turn ends when the next player in sequence, uh, touches the tower or when 10
6010220	6016060	seconds have elapsed since the placement of a block, whatever occurs first. Of course, we're
6016060	6021180	usually just like, okay, you're next, okay, you're next, okay, you're next. The game ends when any
6021180	6027980	portion of the tower collapses. So either caused by the removal of a block or a new placement,
6028700	6032780	the last player to complete a turn before the collapse is the winner.
6033980	6043980	Okay, so basically, um, the, the game, uh, that Leslie created, um, it's based on a game that
6043980	6052060	evolved within her family since the 70s that used children's building blocks. Um, the family, um,
6052060	6060460	had purchased, uh, these blocks from a sawmill in Ghana and the name Jenga comes from a Swahili word,
6060460	6069740	uh, Kujenga, which means to build. Um, and so, uh, she, she herself was raised speaking English
6069740	6076380	and Swahili, um, before moving to, to Ghana. And so she trademarked the name Jenga at the London
6076380	6083740	Toy Fair, January, 1983, and then sold it through her own company, Leslie Scott Associates. Um,
6083740	6090140	the first sets were manufactured, uh, by the Campbell Village, uh, Village Trust in
6090140	6098700	Boughton, Yorkshire. And, um, one of those originals is, uh, on display at the V&A Museum of
6098700	6107500	Childhood. Um, so at any rate, um, Robert Grebler in 1984, an entrepreneur from California,
6108220	6114860	um, who was close to, uh, Leslie Scott's brother, asked, uh, about interest in importing and
6114860	6124380	distributing in Canada. And so it, uh, basically got the rights, uh, to sell Jenga in the US and
6124380	6136380	Canada. And then in October of, uh, 95, Jenga was, uh, basically started, uh, production through the,
6136380	6144380	uh, Poconobe Associates. I had to look at that name again. Um, and so eventually though it ended
6144380	6156060	up in Hasbro's hands, uh, in 1987. Um, as of, uh, 2019, according to Poconobe associations, the ones
6156060	6164060	who own the brand, over 80 million Jenga games, uh, have been sold. That's equivalent to more than 4.3
6164060	6172380	billion Jenga blocks. Um, and on November 5th, which is my mom's birthday, 2020, Jenga was inducted
6172380	6184300	into the National Toy Hall of Fame. So let's get into some records. Um, the, uh, the, uh, packaging
6184300	6191260	on one, uh, edition of Jenga said that Robert Grebler may have built the tallest Jenga tower
6191260	6199900	at 40 and two-thirds levels in 1985, playing with an original set by Leslie Scott. Um, so there are
6199900	6206300	other, uh, variants. There's the Throw and Go Jenga, which has different colors and a six-sided die.
6207020	6214140	Um, there's Jenga Truth or Dare. Um, there is Jenga Extreme that uses parallelogram blocks.
6215100	6223740	Uh, Casino Jenga, which is, uh, a Las Vegas edition with roulette style gameplay. Um, and then there's,
6223740	6229580	you know, the collector's ones like, you know, for various sports ball teams, Hello Kitty, Transformers,
6229580	6238220	Nightmare Before Christmas, Donkey Kong, all kinds of different ones. Um, and then there are
6238220	6251180	two other versions. One is Jenga XXL, which is, uh, big, um, and Jenga Giant. Um, so there's different
6251180	6259100	variations of them. Jenga XXL starts at four feet high and can reach over eight feet. Um,
6259660	6264940	uses the same rules, but you can use, you know, two, you have to use two hands to move the 18
6264940	6271340	inch long blocks. Um, and then Jenga Giant can start off with five feet or more. And I mean,
6271340	6277820	and we've even played, uh, them at, uh, Coin Op. I was going to say Coin Op had one of those,
6277820	6282460	or do they still have it? I haven't been at Coin Op since before the pandemic. Um,
6282860	6292220	and they've got a different director for the arcade now. Um, but there is now, um, a Jenga
6292220	6297580	Pass Challenge that has a handheld platform that the game is played on where the players
6297580	6302700	remove a block while holding the platform and then pass the platform to the next player.
6303340	6311100	It only uses half a number of blocks. Um, but I'm sure you can see how that would be
6311180	6320060	fairly challenging. In, in modern culture, there is also a building nicknamed the Jenga building.
6321100	6330460	And this is, uh, at 56 Leonard Street, um, in Manhattan. And it does look very Jenga-like on top.
6332860	6339180	And so that's it. That's the game. All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week,
6339740	6345900	non-game, excuse me, non-video game game. Non-video game game of the week, uh, Jenga.
6345900	6350700	And some folks in chat are asking about Jenga Tetris. So yeah, I mean, I guess there was the,
6350700	6355260	uh, form of it. And I just found a listing here on eBay real quick. So you can kind of see what
6355260	6358460	it looks like, but it looks like they just kind of make the blocks a little more out of like the
6358460	6365340	Tetris, uh, type of pieces. So that's kind of interesting. Yeah. So, all right. And yeah,
6365340	6369820	several people in chat talking about the giant Jenga. I'm sure Quainot probably isn't the only
6369820	6375420	bar that has one of these because I've seen them at several places. So, uh, yeah. Pod culture says
6375420	6380300	drunk Jenga is a trip. That's why I think you see it a lot of times at a bar. Uh, I can't see says
6380300	6386060	you haven't lived until you've played giant Jenga. So great pick. That's definitely one that, and it
6386060	6390860	even has like a video game crossover technically with the Tetris version. So, uh, yeah. Great,
6390860	6397820	great game that I think we've all played at one point or another. So excellent. Yeah. All right.
6397820	6403020	Let's quickly check out some other headlines in a segment we call rapid fire news. Loki.
6403980	6410940	Yes. So if you don't want to purchase, uh, the latest in wonder butter franchise games that
6410940	6417900	may have questionable people behind them, uh, there are alternative wizarding game collections
6417900	6423420	that you can purchase instead. One of those being the, uh, trans, which game bundle,
6423420	6429180	which is available through itch IO. Um, they have lots of different games in there,
6429180	6437580	69 games to be exact. And it's, it's available for, uh, $60. And if you can't purchase that one,
6437580	6442540	there's an alternative bundle for $10. And they've apparently raised nearly $5,000.
6443260	6449340	Um, as of right now, they're up to 74 K as we're taping live on Sunday night. Oh,
6449340	6454460	that's really good. Their goal is 96 K, but there's still 12 days to go. So nice. And
6454460	6458300	there'll be, it's going to be available until February 24th. So you still got some time.
6458940	6463820	Nice. So that's pretty sweet. Um, then we've got a little bit of a look at what's coming to
6463820	6470620	game pass in February, or I guess the rest of February. Um, so we've got,
6470620	6473980	it looks like atomic heart, which looks pretty awesome. I actually want to play that,
6473980	6480700	um, mountain blade to banner Lord, uh, SD Gundam, uh, battle Alliance.
6481660	6487500	And then we've got city skylines, remastered shadow warrior three definitive edition
6488300	6494940	and Madison NFL 23, which actually already came out earlier, uh, this week or last week,
6495820	6501100	just the time for the super bowl. Um, yeah, pretty cool. I really want to check out actually
6501100	6507580	atomic cart and then, uh, games leaving the service as well. Uh, besiege it's all right.
6507580	6516860	Uh, crossfire X, uh, infernax recompiles skull or skull, the hero Slayer and last kids on earth.
6516860	6525180	Okay. Uh, one other article for this segment, uh, talks about a, uh, rating that has just
6525180	6531020	come out in Korea for Sonic origins. Plus Sonic origins of course was released on the switch in
6531020	6536060	June of 2022. It was the original Sonic, Sonic two, Sonic three and knuckles and Sonic CD in
6536060	6541900	a new remastered form. Uh, it had new areas to explore and a new anniversary mode. Uh,
6541900	6546060	it seems like there could be an expansion coming now. Maybe they're going to add new games to it.
6546140	6549580	Who knows? Maybe they'll put in like spin-offs like Sonic spin ball. I don't know. That is all
6549580	6556300	speculation, but Sega did this once before with Sonic mania about a year after Sonic mania came
6556300	6562140	out, Sonic mania plus came out and that had new characters, mighty the armadillo Ray, the flying
6562140	6567580	squirrel, and then Encore mode that remix the levels and had a different live, uh, lives
6567580	6574620	mechanic, uh, as well as a four player competition mode. So seems pretty likely that Sonic origins is
6574620	6580620	headed down the same route, but we will wait for an official announcement until we speculate much
6580620	6585180	more on that. All right. But, uh, something we don't have to speculate on is what is hitting
6585180	6590220	store shelves this week. So let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. So
6590220	6596620	Loki, we'll start with you in the U S uh, we have Blanc, uh, which is on PC and Nintendo switch

6686300	6691900	and X-Box series. All right. Going to Japan and checking out the releases over there.
6692540	6696380	A lot of overlap. Hmm. What's that? Toa plan is fun to say.
6698860	6702700	All right. Heading over to Japan and checking out the releases there. It's pretty similar
6702700	6706380	a lot of the same stuff that's being released in the U S we have some worldwide would really
6706380	6711660	releases, but to recap on the Nintendo switch in Japan this week, the tales of symphonia remaster
6711660	6715660	does come out in a multi-language edition in Japan this week on the switch theater them
6715660	6719580	final bar line, of course, also in Japan this week. And it should be mentioned that that is

6725740	6730860	is also coming out in Japan this week on the switch. Uh, that has, if you're wondering
6730860	6738220	as divine hearts to revenant dogma, Fern's gate and Al vastia Chronicles. These are all like very,
6738220	6742300	I don't know if any of these ever came out in the U S but, uh, they're available, uh, in this
6742300	6748940	selection here for Japan. Uh, that is pretty much it for the switch. Let me peek at the PlayStation
6748940	6755980	five. And we have, uh, in sound mind releases on the PlayStation five this week. Um,
6756380	6760300	but not wanted dead. That game is not getting a Japanese release, at least not yet.
6760300	6764300	Uh, but wild hearts is, so that is something you can look forward to in Japan this week on
6764300	6770940	the 17th. Um, dark soccer, if you're good, we'll go to UK, uh, released. There's only a few.
6770940	6779820	Cool. So on the 14th, uh, for PlayStation and Xbox, there's wanted dead on the 16th
6780620	6784300	for PlayStation and switch. We have future of them final bar line.
6784940	6790940	And then the rest are on the 17th. Um, for PlayStation, Xbox, and switch,
6790940	6798220	we have tales of symphonia and gigantosaurus dino cart. And then just for PlayStation and Xbox,
6798220	6805180	we have wild hearts. Now what's funner to say toa plan or gigantus dinosaur,
6805820	6812940	I get to source dinosaur. I'm going to go with toa plan just because it's like a series of
6814620	6823180	sounds that you don't often say in. Fair enough in daily usage, but gigantosaurus
6823180	6827660	is a close second. I would say, you know, people add source to all kinds of things when they're
6827660	6833660	talking about making something big or violent. Yeah. All right. Uh, we have just a few more
6833660	6840860	stories for you. Oh, I do have one other thing for the record. Um, another layer to the game
6840860	6850860	that shall not be mentioned is that Greg Ellis was a voice in it who, uh, well, okay. So he was
6850860	6857420	Cullen in the dragon age games. He also went on a big in character rant, uh, anti trans rant.
6857820	6866220	Oh, and he is pro, uh, dumpster. And she thanked him directly.
6867820	6873340	Anyway. Yeah. I just thought I would throw that in. If you want another reason not to play,
6874460	6877260	just throwing that out there. He did 12 characters in it.
6878060	6882540	Let's move on to talk about some other stories of what's going on in gaming this week. Uh,
6882540	6886060	and then we'll get to your calls, et cetera, and that sort of thing. If you would like
6886060	6891820	over at our discord, vog network.com slash discord. So Loki, let me go to you with the
6891820	6896780	next story. Hi. You thought we were done talking about Activision Blizzard and the acquisition of,
6896780	6903180	uh, or Microsoft's acquisition of their company. Oh no, no. We still have more to talk about,
6903180	6910700	including how Sony is saying that Microsoft is harassing them in court. Um, the long and short
6910700	6917420	of it is basically my brother was hitting me. They'll basically, I don't even want to go
6917420	6923740	through the fluff in this article. Anyways, it comes down to that Microsoft is requesting
6923740	6929500	documentation from their internal documents that are subpoena and that stuff, but they're
6929500	6936620	subpoenaing a lot of things. They said, um, including, um, you know, what was it they
6936620	6941660	require? Uh, they said specific showing of relevance regarding the production of personal
6941660	6947340	file or personnel files. So they were subpoenaing the, uh, performance reviews and like some other
6947340	6954220	stuff that didn't seem to be within scope of, you know, this whole acquisition thing. But,
6954220	6958300	and so because of that, they're saying it's harassing, harassing them or something.
6958620	6965500	We that I, that, that's pretty much, yeah, that, that's how it's sum up.
6966060	6968860	I thought it was going to go somewhere like, oh, Microsoft's trying to subpoena,
6968860	6973340	like the games that Sony is currently making and their upcoming release calendar to spill that all
6973340	6979020	in the car. That would be funny. That would be funny. Not, well, not really actually funny if
6979020	6985420	you work in the industry, but to the rest of us really funny. So that, that maybe Sony would have
6985420	6988780	a leg to stand on if Microsoft was trying to subpoena that sort of thing, which I
6989580	6991740	would think would be a part of this. If they're going that far.
6992620	6995420	That would be more relevant than necessarily, you know,
6995420	7000940	right. It is relevant, right. I need to know what Bob got on his performance review, uh,
7000940	7007420	in order to, you know, combat this acquisition. I don't even know. I'm just so sick of this.
7007420	7012940	It's just, will they, won't they like, I'm tired at this point. Yeah, I know. Maybe we
7012940	7017980	should just not talk about it anymore. Should we just like bar talking about this or we'd
7017980	7023740	have literally nothing left to talk about in the show. So this one I think has to stay.
7023740	7027900	This one has to stay. It could have, it could also like trickle down and impact the industry.
7027900	7032060	Cause we, you know, we're all watching for when this does get blocked and then Sony buys
7032060	7036940	Activision Blizzard. Yes. We know that that's happening. We have to, we, we cannot block,
7036940	7041100	we can't block the story or else we never get to deliver the punchline.
7041740	7045820	Cause yes, exactly. Cause then cause, and that's, it's going to be funny and all of a sudden it's
7045820	7051260	like, Oh, well, you know, these issues for with Microsoft now, it's not an issue for Sony to do
7051260	7056300	it. And, uh, I just don't care anymore. I really don't. Well, you can go to the next story then,
7056300	7061980	if you want to talk about something else. Yes. Let's talk about something that you don't need.
7061980	7066860	I'm going to tell you that from personal experience. It's a brand new game. Not really
7066940	7072060	called hot wheels, rift rally. It's a mixed reality game from Velen studios.
7072060	7076060	You may recognize them from your other device that you bought that you thought you were going to use
7076060	7081260	because it seemed really innovative at the time. It's a Mario Kart live home circuit. Remember
7081260	7089180	that game? Yes. No one plays it anymore. Ours is in a box. Um, it is basically the AR Mario
7089180	7095340	Kart thing that you had a little remote control car with a camera on it. And you set up different
7095340	7101340	like checkpoints in your house and you drive your car through your house and it makes a track based
7101340	7106300	off that in game. So it's like that, but strip out all the Mario Kart stuff. And then that's what the
7106300	7111500	hot wheels game is. It has hot wheels stuff in it now. It's literally a port of the Mario Kart thing
7111500	7117980	for PlayStation. Yes. It's for PlayStation and iOS. Yes. And, and along with that, I think they
7117980	7124540	raised the price. I don't know. It's $130 for the standard edition and then, um, $150 for
7124540	7129260	collector's edition, which also throws in a special hot wheels, diecast toy car.
7129980	7135660	Won't anybody think of that cat in the trailer? That poor cat is being assaulted by these cars
7135660	7141020	that keep going by. Won't anybody think of the cat? Well, you just have to understand
7141020	7149020	number one, like it sounds great on paper. Like, yes, this is a cool idea racing through my house.
7149020	7156060	It's so awesome and wonderful, except it's Bluetooth and Bluetooth has its limitations.
7156060	7160540	So it's not racing through your house. It's racing through the same room that you're in,
7160540	7168620	and it's not really racing. It's setting up some checkpoints in a very small area in your room
7168620	7177660	because, you know, the, the cars can't go too far away from your home console. Um, it really is.
7178380	7183260	It's really boring is really what it comes down to. It's, it's not a good game. It's,
7184860	7189660	it's just, it's something that sounds cool on paper. You play it twice and then you're just
7189660	7194220	like, I'm done. And you put it away and then you've dropped, you've wasted that money. You
7194220	7198220	know, it's, it's a thing that like your friend comes over and you're like, Hey, I got to show
7198220	7201500	you this really cool thing. Let's look at the thing. And then you set it up and you do the
7201500	7206060	whole thing. And then it's like, Oh, cool. Cool. Like we saw the thing. All right. That was awesome.
7206060	7210220	All right. Let's go smoke weed. Like that's, that's like, and then it gives back in the box.
7210220	7215100	That's it. And considering too, like if you want to race your friends or something like that,
7215100	7222380	you're gonna have to buy multiples of these. So like, it's just, it's not, it's not worth it.
7222460	7227420	Let me tell you from experience, don't, you don't need it. It is, it is garbage.
7231020	7235740	If they had a way to like increase the range on those things, like if I could go like
7235740	7240540	a hundred feet away. Yeah, that might be pretty cool. Take down to the park. Oh,
7240540	7247340	that's right. It doesn't work outside. Okay. Well, if, if somehow I could do it in like,
7247340	7254140	say a gymnasium or something like that, might be pretty cool. Yeah. But that's like a very
7254140	7260860	slick scenario there. You know what? We actually have RC cars and we can play with them outside
7260860	7265580	and get into a lot more trouble than with the game and the kit to buy with it. Oh yeah. Those
7265580	7269900	are a lot more exciting. And I don't think they're, you know, I haven't purchased an RC car.
7270540	7275020	Ours were pretty expensive, but ours were also custom. You know what? I have a balloon and I
7275020	7283820	can fly it anywhere I want. It's not over Montana. All right. You know what, Rob? What?
7288380	7294860	That sigh is the sound of my mood. I'm going to eat some Jelly Billies now in protest.
7294860	7298860	All right. Well, while you eat Jelly Billies, which is fine, because I have another VR story,
7298860	7303500	so maybe Jelly Billies are a good thing to confide in in this time. Maybe, maybe China's just testing
7303500	7308060	out the battle bus, you know, maybe they see for they like, you know what, maybe that could work.
7308060	7312700	Maybe we could float a bus with a balloon. And then here people are shooting them down like,
7312700	7320860	just I don't know. It's sad. All right. Anyway, we have another update this week that the official
7320860	7327900	PlayStation VR FAQ has actually been unveiled. And that is something that you can check out on
7327900	7333980	Sony's website because believe it or not, that Sony device is only what like it's on the 22nd.
7333980	7338300	That's like less than two weeks away. So I don't know how many of y'all are planning on getting
7338300	7343900	one. But maybe you needed some of the latest details on what's going on. And unfortunately,
7343900	7349340	the story I was trying to read was the wrong one. So I'm quickly trying to find it again here so I
7349340	7356780	can bring it up. Which, yeah, I know the right. Okay, I found it. Yay. All right. So again,
7356780	7364300	it's a $550 device. And there will be 30 games to choose from although some of them are rehashes.
7365180	7370460	We have some of the explanations officially about why the original PS VR games don't work on PS VR
7370460	7376860	two. Sony explains it like this. PS VR two is designed to deliver a truly next gen VR experience
7376860	7381580	with advanced features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, inside out tracking,
7381580	7385740	eye tracking and more due to this new approach to playing games and PS VR two
7385740	7391100	PS VR games are not compatible with PS VR two which you know, I with all this
7391100	7395420	it's completely different. Yeah, I basically Yeah, which with all the crap I've given the
7395420	7404140	PS VR two I that is a reasonable explanation. I get it. Also, it talks about the space you're
7404140	7411580	going to need. So you need a minimum play area of two square meters or six feet seven inches by six
7411580	7417580	feet seven inches. So that's a little taller than a human on either side. The standing and sitting
7417580	7423420	modes require one square meter so three feet four inches on either side but you have to be able to
7423420	7427340	move your arms and the sense controllers around without knocking shit over which might be a little
7427340	7432860	bit less than the PlayStation VR one because I think the VR one required more space because I
7432860	7438140	have a camera to see it too. Yeah. So that's nice. At least a reminder there is no camera with this
7438140	7444300	that doesn't work on that technology. But if you have a PS five HD camera, you can fully film
7444300	7449420	yourself while you are playing and you can broadcast that footage as well. The PS five only
7449420	7454140	supports one headset at a time but friends and family in the room can see what you're doing on
7454140	7459500	the TV, which I believe was the same thing. You can see everything. So all of the things that
7459500	7464300	you're doing also kind of similar again to the first device is cinematic mode that allows you
7464300	7470940	to view non VR content while wearing the headset which can be which they illustrate could be useful
7470940	7474700	if somebody else wants to use the TV to watch something else. It's almost like having a second
7474700	7481660	TV in that way. But you will not be able to play 2d games or watch media in 4k cinematic mode is
7481660	7487740	10 ADP with HDR with a 120 hertz refresh. I couldn't why can't you play 2d games?
7488380	7494460	The downside is you won't be playing 2d games. Oh, you can't play them in 4k. Oh, sorry. That's
7494460	7498460	what I say. Sorry about that. I butchered the sentence a little bit there. So you just like
7498460	7506860	sorry, only 3d games, sprite based games, we just can't do that. And also once the VR two is set up,
7506860	7513260	you actually no longer need the TV, which is interesting. So you could take it with you,
7513260	7517180	essentially, if you had a way to run it. But that's kind of interesting.
7517180	7521260	I don't know if you need that. I think it's just you don't need to display it on the TV in case
7521260	7525260	you don't need people to watch still need a PlayStation five generator. Yeah.
7526220	7529500	I'll just use a little hand crank generator while I play some VR.
7529500	7535420	Use the prop cycle bike to generate some power. Absolutely. All right. Well,
7535420	7539100	I'd be curious to hear from those of you that do end up getting one of these. I don't know.
7539100	7545260	Could you imagine VR prop cycle? Yes, I'd actually I'd be into that for sure. Be fun.
7545260	7550700	They give him Peloton. That's that's for the Peloton metacross over there. That's right.
7550700	7554460	That's right. Well, believe that it needs to actually have like the steering
7554460	7559820	thing in the push thing. Believe it or not, that brings us to the end of the news that
7559820	7563580	we had on deck for tonight. But we do want to open it up to the listener roundtable.
7563580	7567340	So if you guys have any extra questions for us, by all means, you can ask in chat over
7567340	7573180	by all means, you can ask in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Also, you can
7574540	7579100	send us a tweet over at O.L.R., although I must admit, I forgot to check the Twitter,
7579100	7583020	as I often do. But I'll go peek at that real quick just to see if anything came in there.
7583020	7589660	You do have the opportunity to quote Spaceballs about the inbox. We ain't found shit.
7589660	7595100	That's right. Because you can email us as well. Participate at orange lounge radio.com is a great
7595100	7599900	place to email us each week. Although I notice it's been like two months since we've gotten an
7599900	7605020	email. So a real one anyway. I don't know how much longer I'm going to keep advertising that if y'all
7605020	7610540	aren't going to use it. How maybe I should ask this generally. I mean, and I don't want to bully
7610540	7616140	people to send emails. I also realize less and less people are using emails for fun. You know,
7616140	7623100	emails kind of make you think of work. I'm kind of curious, you know, if we were to evolve from
7623100	7627740	emails, how would you like to interact with the show? You know, we're open to more ideas. Do you
7627740	7631820	want to be able to send us like short video messages like TikTok or something? Like we could
7631820	7636780	make one of those, I guess. And you can send us short videos. I'd be fine with that. I just feel
7636780	7641820	like people don't really want to make videos, but maybe I'd be surprised. I don't know. Or, you know,
7641820	7646780	should I be focusing on the Twitter more often or should I have a dedicated Discord thing? I do want
7646780	7651340	to just kind of open it up generally. Like, how do you want to interact with us? Because I can...
7651340	7652380	And email us the answer.
7654140	7659340	I can understand the emails are getting a little dated and that's fine. So, yeah.
7659340	7661580	Well, that's all the people who spam me.
7661580	7666940	The $64,000 question, I guess. But not actual $64,000 because we don't have that kind of budget.
7667820	7671660	I will say this too. Jason wanted me to kind of give a shout out here. I'll say this again next
7671660	7675420	week because I just think we have less of an audience tonight because of other things going on
7676220	7683100	in specifically America. But if you want to contribute a bump to the show,
7683100	7688140	so this is only for the live folks was we do a little... And I think I've mentioned this before,
7688140	7694700	but I'll reiterate. We do a little, you can't do that on television inspired parody intro with
7694700	7699100	such and such will not be seen tonight so that we can bring you this special presentation.
7699100	7705100	So, actually, I will very specially play the one from tonight. So, you're going to hear the little
7705660	7710220	VOG logo music. And just so even those of you on the podcast can get an example of what one sounds
7710220	7714460	like, I'm going to actually go ahead and play one right here so you can hear it. So, here was
7714460	7725500	tonight's bump. For Nintendo Switch Online will not be seen tonight, nor ever so that we can bring
7725500	7729820	you this special presentation. Okay, so he embellished that one a little bit by saying
7729820	7734060	or ever but that's fine. A little embellishment is fine. And I think the audio hiccup I don't
7734060	7739260	know why but it was Ouya for Nintendo Switch Online, which obviously very good parody of
7739260	7744540	the Game Boy and the Game Boy Advance with a console we know will never see the light of day
7744540	7752380	ever again. So ironically had a lot of Nintendo games emulated on it. Yeah, yeah. So, sj100mat
7752380	7758060	says I sent a video if you my point was if you want to do one of those, by all means send them
7758060	7765340	to us. You can either email us a link, tweet us a link, or join our discord and you can honestly
7765340	7769020	just probably message me directly in discord and I'll get it or just post it in the orange
7769020	7772300	orange right? Well, don't post it there because then you'll spoil it, everybody will see it.
7772300	7778540	So, if you need the VOG network discord, it's vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com slash discord.
7779260	7783340	Maybe I'll make a thread within the orange orange radio. Even if you don't feel like recording one,
7783340	7787900	because not everybody's a video. If you just have an idea. I remember somebody submitted one a
7788460	7794300	long time ago. I think it was Miramuse a long time ago before dark soccer and I hit this game
7794300	7801260	full tilt boogie. She sent dead by daylight savings time. Funny, appropriate because I believe it was
7801260	7805980	that week of daylight savings time. So great. Even if you don't have the video production
7805980	7812700	capabilities, send us some funny puns and we'll turn some of our favorites into actual bumpers
7812700	7817500	to be used here live. I think that's a lot of fun. I just got inspiration for another shirt just now.
7818460	7821260	Oh, yeah, daily savings is coming up. Get on it.
7822060	7825820	No, for dead by daylight. Instead of hookers just have it say campers.
7827100	7834380	Hello campers with Bubba in the chainsaw. Bonds006 says do you want to open that door?
7834380	7838220	Video messages on the couch and sleepwear. I really don't give a fuck what you're wearing
7838220	7842620	as long as you understand that I'm going to broadcast some of those. And you do have to
7842620	7848300	be meeting Twitch standards. So you can't send that kind of video. We don't need that kind of
7848300	7850540	don't send us that kind of video. We don't want that kind of video.
7850540	7852460	Yeah, this isn't PlayStation G's.
7852460	7859500	I know this isn't the playroom on PlayStation 4's live service. Okay. Don't send us that.
7861180	7865820	But if you want to wear pajamas, I'm not going to judge you whatever. But I think a lot of people
7865820	7871340	filming with your phone is really easy. So people do it, you know, so maybe that's maybe we need a
7871340	7876780	short message phone submission service. I think it would be fun to see more listeners. And a lot
7876780	7881980	of people are pretty willing to shoot selfies of video. I don't know. We'll see. So maybe I need
7881980	7888620	to figure out a way to get those more submitted to us. I need to make a TikTok for Orange Launch
7888620	7892940	Radio. We have one for fog network, but we don't have one I don't think for OLR. So because that's
7892940	7897260	an easy way to submit videos. So maybe we'll do that in the future. Who knows? Let me check with
7897260	7900620	Loki real quick and see if there's any last minute stories we want to get to before we wrap things up.
7900620	7906460	There's nothing out there. It's, it's, I mean, unless you haven't seen it, there's, you know,
7906460	7912620	the new, like funny trailer teaser promotional thing that they have for the Mario release movie
7912620	7916780	with the Mario wrap in it. That's it. Oh, Jamie kind of referenced at the beginning. Yeah,
7916780	7924300	yeah, that is cute. Yeah, that's about it. I mean, all right. Hmm. Well, we're gonna go around now
7924300	7928460	and get everybody's final thoughts and say good night. But before I do, I want to thank all of

8018220	8025260	Mobile stuff to build they need to get done. All right. And then my final thought is,
8026220	8031580	I got to host a pair of shows this weekend. Live here in Sacramento area. I talked about
8031580	8036780	a little bit last week. They went really well. I had a great time. And there was a lot of fun.
8036780	8041420	And I just found out I'm going to be hosting I think it's May 8, we're going to be doing a bad
8041420	8048780	movie festival. And I'm so excited. We're going to do the room troll to and another film to be
8048780	8054300	determined. And I'm really excited about that because I love bad campy movies. So really
8054300	8058540	excited about that. So we'll stay tuned to see what other he's trying to get movies where he
8058540	8061100	can get one of this like because he has one of the people from the room and he has one of the
8061180	8066700	people from troll to coming out. So trying to get somebody from a third movie. So we'll see what
8066700	8071740	happens with that. So lots of fun. Until then, that's going to do it for another episode orange
8071740	8077500	launch radio. I hope you all have a fantastic week of happy gaming. We will see you in seven days and
8077500	8082460	Bobby will be back next week as well to do it all again. So have a great week everybody. Good night.
