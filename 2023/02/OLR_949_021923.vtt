WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
I love Theorhythm. It's easily among the best spin-offs of a decades-long series that

00:14.640 --> 00:18.280
accentuates one of the consistently best things to come from it. However, I miss Theorhythm

00:18.280 --> 00:22.640
Dragon Quest, predominantly because it only came out in Japan. Reportedly, the final Barline

00:22.640 --> 00:27.000
team wants to branch out beyond Final Fantasy and Square Enix properties. Two sore thumbs

00:27.000 --> 00:32.880
way up. Yes, please. This is the BMS FMS OMG LOL update. Now it's time for your hosts Rob

00:32.880 --> 00:35.600
Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's

00:35.600 --> 00:38.480
gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.960 --> 00:45.680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:45.680 --> 00:52.800
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode

00:52.800 --> 01:00.760
number 949 of our show for tonight, February 19, 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here

01:00.760 --> 01:05.080
with you every week with my pals to talk about the latest and greatest in video gaming and get

01:05.080 --> 01:09.960
your input as we tape live because we want to hear your thoughts too. But in the meantime, you

01:09.960 --> 01:15.400
get my thoughts and you get the thoughts of DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers. Hello. Hello. How

01:15.400 --> 01:16.000
are you doing?

01:17.080 --> 01:18.720
I feel better than I sound.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.440
I was gonna I was gonna kind of get a check in because I know you know you were out two weeks

01:22.480 --> 01:28.320
ago that you're like still recovering last week. So mostly on the mend at this point you feel

01:28.320 --> 01:29.120
better than you sound.

01:30.600 --> 01:37.760
Yeah, I mean, my throat's still pretty bad. I honestly think that my bout with COVID kind of

01:38.200 --> 01:47.160
undid some of the the good that had gone from my my week saw from work. So I emailed my doctor

01:47.160 --> 01:49.280
because I'm pretty sure I have a sinus infection now.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.200
Oh, gosh.

01:50.800 --> 01:56.120
Well, you know, I get them like at the drop of a hat. So it's not like it's just the cough

01:56.120 --> 02:04.320
afterward I've already taken. I always forget like their their brand name, like Tesla line pearls or

02:04.320 --> 02:09.640
something. It sounds like something from a sci fi show. I know it has been donated. It's really

02:09.680 --> 02:16.000
good cough suppressant. I mean, well, I have to get a prescription and then there's this crap.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.120
Well, for gosh sakes be healed.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.080
Lido cane.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.440
Yeah, it's Dennis numbing solution there.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.720
It's not delicious. It's but it feels really good when you've like gotten past the initial

02:30.720 --> 02:37.360
nastiness, especially if you drink something cold with it. It's like extra numb.

02:38.440 --> 02:43.000
All right, well, I mean, hopefully the upside to being sick is that you've had a lot of time to

02:43.000 --> 02:47.880
play games, but we'll check in in just a little bit. In the meantime, let's say hello as well to

02:47.880 --> 02:49.240
Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.

02:49.960 --> 02:50.640
Hey, how's it going?

02:50.720 --> 02:53.480
I am doing good. How's your week been?

02:54.160 --> 02:57.640
It's been all right. Yeah. Busy, busy. Yeah.

02:58.320 --> 03:04.880
So we do tape live of course, at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice of geeks network every

03:04.880 --> 03:09.880
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And

03:09.880 --> 03:14.640
if you care to join us live, you can see our lovely faces as we're chatting doing this show and

03:14.640 --> 03:19.800
sometimes there's visual flair going on. For example, Loki likes to have, you know, different

03:19.800 --> 03:24.760
video games that are playing behind him while he's chatting and tonight I it looks like some

03:24.760 --> 03:30.200
version of theme park or is that is that the new the newer one rollercoaster? Planet Coaster? Yeah,

03:30.200 --> 03:35.560
okay. Yeah, it's that one. I'm sorry, but every time I see one of those theme park games, I always

03:35.560 --> 03:41.160
think of that video I saw somewhere of rollercoaster tycoon or something where like the the

03:41.160 --> 03:46.120
Rihanna song is playing and it's all happy. And then the coaster goes off the rails and everybody

03:46.120 --> 03:52.520
dies and it turns to Adele and I don't know why it's the funniest fucking video, but it is. So

03:53.440 --> 03:58.960
anyway, it's a lot funnier than I just described it. I promise look it up on YouTube. I don't even

03:58.960 --> 04:05.520
know what it's called. But Tiger Claw will still find it I'm sure so. But why Planet Coaster? Is

04:05.520 --> 04:07.920
that a game that you've been into lately? Or you just been thinking about?

04:08.480 --> 04:13.760
No, I just I saw a video earlier this week of one of the streamers I watch, Doug Doug,

04:13.760 --> 04:23.040
and he did a thing where he was trying to survive in Planet Coaster for one hour. But every five

04:23.040 --> 04:28.480
minutes of random like he had this giant wheel they'd spend there'd be a random kind of handicap

04:28.480 --> 04:34.560
in the game. So like whether you had to like spend half your money on benches or like move the

04:34.560 --> 04:40.800
coaster to the farthest end of the park and like ridiculous stuff like that. And so it was it was

04:40.800 --> 04:44.400
just like that video is pretty funny. So it reminded me of that as like, you know, I should

04:44.400 --> 04:51.040
probably play that game since I have it and I not played it but I probably should play it looks fun.

04:52.560 --> 04:58.080
Apparently SSJ 100 Matt won the YouTube fight there because there it is. Apparently that's it.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.760
I can't bring it up because I don't want to get the station DMCA'd with the copyright music,

05:01.760 --> 05:07.920
but I'm just assuming it's right. So good job, Matt. Awesome. All right.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.000
I've seen that video without the music before.

05:10.880 --> 05:17.040
The music makes it that much better. It really does. All right. Sorry to the podcast listeners.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.760
Ask on Discord. We'll post the link at our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord,

05:23.760 --> 05:28.800
where you can join and chat with us throughout the week or throughout the next two weeks. I know I've

05:28.800 --> 05:33.200
been saying this, you know, broken record the last month. But for those that, you know, maybe don't

05:33.200 --> 05:37.920
check in every week and what have you, I will not be here next week. Alan and I are going on a

05:37.920 --> 05:44.160
well-deserved vacation. I'm just gonna say it. We earned it and we're going on vacation. And we did

05:44.160 --> 05:51.200
this in 2020 right in the before times we went on the Star Trek cruise. So we are going again this

05:51.200 --> 05:57.200
year. We skipped, they actually did a cruise last year. But between the home buying and we still

05:57.200 --> 06:02.880
weren't quite comfortable with where COVID was at in the world at that point. So we didn't go

06:02.880 --> 06:08.720
last year. But this year, it's kind of one of those. Well, that thing can get me anywhere. So

06:08.720 --> 06:13.440
I'm just saying screw it and going on the cruise and I think we'll have a good time. So excited

06:13.440 --> 06:19.520
about that. So but I won't be here. So I'm not here to push buttons. So are you streaming next

06:19.520 --> 06:24.000
week Dark Soccer? Are you gonna like just take a week off yourself? Yeah. Awesome. So then check

06:24.000 --> 06:32.400
out Dark Soccer. No, I have a week to make up for. So come hell or high water, you know, I'll

06:32.400 --> 06:37.280
hire a voiceover artist if I have to have someone speak for me, but I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna

06:37.280 --> 06:45.840
start at our time too. You know, with the modern, you know, technology that is AI generated voices,

06:45.840 --> 06:51.360
you could actually just copy your voice with about a minute worth of clips. I've played with that,

06:51.360 --> 06:58.080
and it's fun. You could do it. It sounds weird to myself, but like it's, I'd say it's like 80%

06:58.080 --> 07:03.760
convincing. Link me the thing because I actually what I want to do is use that for Midna in my

07:03.760 --> 07:10.240
videos. Yeah, that could be fun. Get that individual with their absolute chaotic energy

07:10.240 --> 07:14.240
that plays Dead by Daylight Swift with you on stream and get them to just narrate your stream.

07:14.240 --> 07:21.280
Yeah. Shayla would totally do it. Just have Shayla narrate your stream. But honestly,

07:21.280 --> 07:25.440
when Shayla's in there, I don't really have to talk because all of them through the background

07:25.440 --> 07:34.320
you hear, I love you. I love you. Yay, babe onomori. Yay, RPG. I love Shayla. I'm gonna go

07:34.320 --> 07:38.560
boop the killer. I'm gonna go boop the killer. Love me. Love me. Love me. It's really funny.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.920
Did I tell you about the trickster that we totally confused the other last week?

07:43.920 --> 07:47.360
Here we go. I've derailed with Dead by Daylight talk. All right. Make it quick.

07:47.360 --> 07:51.280
We've got news to get into. Okay. It's by daylight derailed by daylight.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.960
But like, I was, I was just gonna play straight. We were in the airy and I was working on where

07:56.960 --> 08:04.320
the no, no, no. Never play straight. Always play gay. Rob. All right. I was going to play

08:04.320 --> 08:12.480
standard. I was going to play a normal game. Got her. And next thing I know, here comes Shayla

08:12.480 --> 08:18.960
being chased by the trickster and then like doing the little, you know, bop thing in, in front of

08:18.960 --> 08:23.760
him and then pointing. And I was like, Oh hell. So I just came over and did the same thing too.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.160
And he just like followed us around for half the match before he decided to start playing seriously.

08:28.720 --> 08:35.040
And then afterwards he comes in my chat and it's like, I'm so confused.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.720
So we, we explained that, that Shayla is the killer whisperer.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.520
And, and I, I said, yeah, we killer mains know our own. I'm a dirty pig main.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.760
All right. All right. So it was pretty funny though.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.360
Derailed by Daylight. Just another segment here on Orange Launch Radio. I love that name.

08:57.360 --> 09:01.760
That's right. Yep. We need to, can somebody arrange that on the Wiki? A Derailed by Daylight

09:01.760 --> 09:05.280
page. All right. And when it was Mass Effect, was it Mass Derailment?

09:06.320 --> 09:09.360
Something like that. I think it was Mass Effect at some point.

09:11.120 --> 09:15.760
All right. Moving on. Let's talk about other video games that are in the news this week.

09:15.760 --> 09:22.160
And Metroid Prime, the remaster is in the news. But this particular reason, maybe not a great

09:22.160 --> 09:27.840
one, but let's talk about maybe the standard this game is calling attention to. I don't think this

09:27.840 --> 09:30.880
is the first game where this has happened, but let's talk about it. Loki, you want to get into

09:30.880 --> 09:37.520
this for us? It's not the first game that's happened. I'm not sure why we can't just include,

09:37.520 --> 09:46.320
you know, credits for the people that make games, but apparently Metroid Prime remastered does not

09:46.320 --> 09:52.240
include the full original game credits. So that everybody that worked on the original game

09:53.200 --> 09:57.680
is not credited in it. All you get instead is a single card that says based on the work of

09:57.680 --> 10:03.760
Metroid Prime, original Nintendo GameCube and Wii version development staff. Like,

10:05.200 --> 10:09.680
it doesn't cost anything to put credits in the game unless they have like some sort of contract

10:09.680 --> 10:13.920
with your name appears in this, then you get money somehow or something like that, which

10:13.920 --> 10:19.200
I mean, they probably should be owed some money at the very least. But I don't understand why

10:19.200 --> 10:23.840
it would be so hard to put current credits for somebody that worked on the game originally. Like

10:23.840 --> 10:29.920
that's what they do when they adapt things and stuff like that. I've seen other remasters that

10:29.920 --> 10:33.040
they put the credits in there. But this isn't like the first time that they've done this.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.600
I remember, I'm trying to remember which game it was now. But I know we had something like that

10:39.600 --> 10:46.000
where it was, you know, the original creator of it wasn't credited before. It wasn't that long

10:46.000 --> 10:53.600
ago either. But I don't know, it is kind of annoying. Let me ask a difficult question, though.

10:53.600 --> 10:58.640
If this individual who tweeted about it, who I'm assuming was one of the individuals who worked on

10:58.640 --> 11:05.040
the original game, if this person hadn't called it out, would anyone have noticed?

11:05.040 --> 11:10.320
Like, how many people are actually watching video game credits? And please don't say yes,

11:10.320 --> 11:15.040
just because you want to be different out there. Like, I just think there's a lot of people,

11:15.680 --> 11:21.840
and I'm not, you know, please don't misunderstand me. I do think, you know, the people that did work

11:21.840 --> 11:26.640
on the game deserve to be acknowledged and so forth. I'm just kind of curious if anyone would

11:26.640 --> 11:30.240
have really noticed if it hadn't been pointed out on social media, because I don't think a lot of

11:30.240 --> 11:34.080
people watch video game credits, or they might play a mini game during the credits or something

11:34.080 --> 11:40.240
like that. And I understand like the, I understand the point, like, if this is a game that's

11:40.240 --> 11:45.680
completely rebuilt from the ground up, and using some of the assets, and even kind of rebuilt the

11:45.680 --> 11:53.200
assets too. So like, I get it, like, it's weird, you know, crediting the original team when you've

11:53.200 --> 11:57.600
basically taken none of their work and just redid it. But I mean, there's still story and other

11:57.600 --> 12:01.440
elements and stuff like that. I still think that they should be credited, like at the very least,

12:01.440 --> 12:08.160
you know, original game, you know, something brief, like, you know, just listening to team

12:08.160 --> 12:11.440
members or something like that, you don't have to go into detail, like this person did, like,

12:11.440 --> 12:16.000
you know, artwork in the original games, like when that's not necessarily represented in the

12:16.000 --> 12:24.560
full game. I still think it is kind of a little bit of like, kind of a, I don't know, but it's

12:24.560 --> 12:30.480
not nice. It's not nice. But to that, like, I don't think it's necessarily the team that did

12:30.480 --> 12:37.600
the remasters job to put that information in there. Also, they may have not had that information

12:37.600 --> 12:41.200
to begin with, like, they may not know who worked on the original game.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.320
Well, right. But like, are you going to watch everything and, you know,

12:48.320 --> 12:53.200
transcribe everything like that's not something. Yeah, you could, but that should be provided by

12:53.200 --> 12:58.560
Nintendo, Nintendo should say, Hey, you know, we want to make sure or they could have reached out

12:58.560 --> 13:03.280
and said, Hey, we want to put the, you know, we want to credit the people that originally worked

13:03.280 --> 13:09.120
on this game. Can we get a list of the credits from the previous game? I don't know. I don't

13:09.120 --> 13:13.680
know what goes on behind the scenes. But yeah, I think it is kind of get their name in there,

13:13.680 --> 13:18.960
even if they lower the font size or do it like what I mean. But this is what credits turn into

13:18.960 --> 13:24.880
sometimes is I think about when they show a movie on TV. And then like, instead of letting the

13:24.880 --> 13:29.680
credits roll, they reduce the credits to like a quarter of the size of the screen while they're

13:29.680 --> 13:33.200
showing the preview for the next movie. And then this credits are just flying by like they turn up

13:33.200 --> 13:38.720
the credits like 10 speed, which is or they flash along the bottom like there's different ways that

13:38.720 --> 13:43.600
they do it. And I think that's I think that's for union related reasons and kind of the point I

13:43.600 --> 13:48.800
wanted to get to. I think those credits have to be shown for like union related reasons. The TV

13:48.800 --> 13:55.120
station just can't cut them out as part of the rights for airing the movie. I wonder if video

13:55.200 --> 14:00.720
game industry is headed for unionization as we've talked about many, you know, past months on this

14:00.720 --> 14:06.080
show. I wonder if we shouldn't see something in there about video game credits in these types of

14:06.080 --> 14:11.040
cases and when they should be kept in the game. I think it would be interesting to see what comes

14:11.040 --> 14:17.520
to that. Whether it ends up being credits on fast forward or what? I mean, this has always been an

14:17.520 --> 14:23.760
issue in the industry. I mean, do we do we not remember adventure or was it adventure? Yeah.

14:24.560 --> 14:30.400
Or the Atari of that era was infamous for not crediting their designers, which is why a lot of

14:30.400 --> 14:35.520
the talented folks went over to Activision, where you could play David Crane's Pitfall,

14:35.520 --> 14:40.240
like his name was right there in the, you know, title of the game. Yeah, that was, you know,

14:40.960 --> 14:45.200
it's interesting to think about Activision today and all of their problems. But actually, in the

14:45.200 --> 14:50.240
80s, Activision was kind of seen as the one that was more progressive when it came to the rights

14:50.240 --> 14:55.760
of the game makers by crediting them in the games and they lured talent that way was huge deal. And

14:55.760 --> 15:00.720
then yes, one of the earliest Easter eggs and adventure like you brought up the initials of the

15:00.720 --> 15:06.800
game's creators. That was that was put in there as kind of an F you to the whole lack of credits

15:06.800 --> 15:12.720
thing. So we can't do that because they would be they caught wind of anything like that. Okay,

15:12.800 --> 15:20.160
we're gonna patch that out, you know? Yeah. So, yeah, we can do and but also remember back in

15:20.160 --> 15:28.480
those days, one person often made those entire games, you know, et yards revenge were both made

15:28.480 --> 15:33.680
by one person is actually the same person infamously the best and the worst 2600 game,

15:33.680 --> 15:38.080
although I actually don't think et is the worst 2600 game, because there's a good game in there

15:38.080 --> 15:42.000
somewhere. Whereas there's other games on the Atari 2600. But there is no good game in there

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
whatsoever. But I digress. I'm going in the chat over twitch.tv slash vog network some folks

15:50.000 --> 15:55.040
answering the question about do you actually look at the chat. Fifth dream in chat says I know

15:55.040 --> 16:00.480
people who named Pokemon who haven't been in the credits since then. Dr. Tia says I heard this was

16:00.480 --> 16:06.240
also an issue with the Pac Man World remaster. Fifth dream says I let them roll. I don't read

16:06.240 --> 16:11.120
every credit. Bobby Black Wolf says depends on how good the music is that's playing behind the

16:11.120 --> 16:15.840
credits. Or if my name is in the credits as a backer. I think we all enjoy a good little

16:15.840 --> 16:20.960
mini game in the credits like Smash Brothers comes to mind. I think there's quite a few shooter games

16:20.960 --> 16:24.560
out there too that have like shooting mini games in the credits and things that didn't katamari

16:24.560 --> 16:28.960
damasi have like a roll up the credits thing or am I making that out? Okay. Oh, no, it did. Yeah.

16:28.960 --> 16:35.520
So there's that. Bobby Black Wolf says if you worked on the game three years ago and left the

16:35.520 --> 16:39.760
company, they don't put your name in the credit. To be fair, some modern games only credit the

16:39.760 --> 16:44.720
people who are with the company when the game is released. Interesting perspective. And then some

16:44.720 --> 16:49.040
other folks bringing up other games that have like credit mini games that help you to get paid

16:49.040 --> 16:53.840
attention. As Joe and Hunter Matt says credits are a voluntary experience for the most part in

16:53.840 --> 16:59.040
gaming. I kind of feel why not just include them if the credits are too long folks can skip them

16:59.040 --> 17:05.200
or not just watch them just seems odd. Well, I always I mean, maybe I'm wrong. But I you know,

17:05.200 --> 17:10.960
Marvel movies are infamous for their post credit scenes and their mid credit scenes and all of

17:10.960 --> 17:16.080
this. And why do they do that? I think in part it's to get people to stay through the credits.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.920
Because pretty much any time you go to see a movie, people get up and leave during the

17:19.920 --> 17:24.720
credits. Although now Marvel has conditioned us all to be afraid to do that. I remember

17:24.720 --> 17:28.960
literally sitting there during Megan and I was like, do we do we need to sit here in case there's

17:28.960 --> 17:33.920
something after the credits. And we quickly googled Megan after credits. And we saw Okay,

17:33.920 --> 17:38.720
no, there's no after credit scene we can go. But it's just it's interesting how that but then you

17:38.720 --> 17:45.680
think think back to the early movies, the early days of movies. credits used to be in the beginning

17:46.480 --> 17:51.760
of the movie. Most relevant example I can think of would be like Rocky Horror Picture Show,

17:51.760 --> 17:57.040
you know, I've seen that movie a lot. And think about that whole opening song with the lips. It's

17:57.040 --> 18:02.800
the opening credits. Now it's not an exhaustive list of credits as they often weren't in that day,

18:02.800 --> 18:09.920
but you get a lot of big credits at the top. This is kind of interesting. So Bobby Lockwolf says

18:09.920 --> 18:14.080
most of the people in the Ant Man screening I was at last night left after the midpoint. Well,

18:14.080 --> 18:20.400
that's on them. I tell you, that's fine. You really only miss a preview of Loki season two

18:20.400 --> 18:24.720
anyway. So it's no big deal. Let's see Fit Dream says I never left because I remember some end

18:24.720 --> 18:30.720
credit scenes as early as the 80s. Dark to see says good. We didn't miss anything. That must be

18:30.720 --> 18:37.280
a reference to Megan. That's really funny. So um, so yeah, I don't know that the credit issue is

18:37.280 --> 18:43.040
interesting. But I think, oh, yeah, Bobby Black will bring it up an 80s movie that had that

18:43.040 --> 18:49.760
Ferris Bueller asking Why are you still here? Remember that after the credits? Go home. Yeah,

18:49.760 --> 18:54.560
it's good, good stuff. But it I think this is gonna be a very interesting issue, especially as

18:54.560 --> 18:59.040
we start looking at like the furthering of unions and games like how this credit issue and even to

18:59.040 --> 19:02.640
Bobby's point, what happens to those folks that they worked on the game, but they left the

19:02.640 --> 19:06.880
company? How do they get credited? I think there's going to be some interesting stuff to come with

19:06.880 --> 19:11.840
this. But also what I would say to the developers out there is put mini games in your credits and

19:11.840 --> 19:17.040
put post credit scenes in there. So if you if you really want people to watch them, but also

19:17.040 --> 19:26.960
some credit scenes are really, really long, like Final Fantasy 14's credits are a lot, especially

19:26.960 --> 19:31.600
I would I would actually encourage you not to watch the realm reborn credits because I believe

19:31.600 --> 19:38.080
they credited all of the 1.0 players that met certain criteria are like actually in the credits

19:38.080 --> 19:44.400
of realm reborn or the early version of it. I think my favorite credits that they've had was

19:44.400 --> 19:50.400
the Lego Movie Two. They made a song about the credits that now that's clever. I like that. And

19:50.400 --> 19:56.800
that was funny. It was great. I like the little mid credit and post credit sequences. I think

19:56.800 --> 20:02.160
that's enough to get people to stick around and like every every RPG at this point has a lot of

20:02.160 --> 20:07.760
those. So you know, it's good. Fifth Dream points out the Weird Al movie has a good end credit song.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.320
All right. Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of good stuff out there. But as far as this game is

20:12.320 --> 20:18.880
concerned, it's it's really a shame what happened to the folks. But also I would kind of ask like

20:18.880 --> 20:24.160
how many people are actually watching these credits. I think we need to maybe have an online

20:24.160 --> 20:29.520
resource as well. Make sure that these folks are credited on the video game version of the internet

20:29.520 --> 20:32.880
movie database and that sort of thing, you know, make sure that they have the credits,

20:32.880 --> 20:36.400
so that when people are looking up their names to see what they worked on for industry stuff,

20:36.400 --> 20:41.840
you can kind of see like what they what they've done fully, I think is a good thing to have out

20:41.840 --> 20:44.960
there too, because that's really what credits are for, right? If your game wins an award,

20:44.960 --> 20:50.320
you want to be able to tout that award. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming

20:50.320 --> 20:54.720
weeks, whether we rolled credits or not, the types of video games that we have been playing

20:54.720 --> 20:57.680
this week. So Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

20:59.440 --> 21:06.880
I played Star Ocean last night on my stream. And I had to do a lot of backtracking. But

21:07.760 --> 21:14.400
I'm really having a good time with it. The game is absolutely gorgeous. And the sprites are huge.

21:14.400 --> 21:25.200
And it's got all the extra audio in it. It's such a good game. And then I was what else I do.

21:26.400 --> 21:33.680
I played of course Dead by Daylight, but I only played like one night because it's funny. Okay,

21:33.680 --> 21:40.560
so I've been in training at work to get myself back into the general scheme of things. And I

21:40.560 --> 21:48.560
had to be up at 5am or 5.30am like that to be at work by seven. And well, the night before that,

21:48.560 --> 21:54.800
because you remember I was just getting over COVID. I went to bed that Monday at like 2am,

21:54.800 --> 22:00.720
or technically Tuesday morning and woke up at 5pm at the time I normally stream.

22:01.360 --> 22:08.080
Needless to say, I didn't play Dead by Daylight that night and I didn't stream. So I'm

22:08.960 --> 22:16.880
uh, I am going, I'm also, I did play A Little Among Us. I love that game. It's pretty fun.

22:18.480 --> 22:24.160
I'm playing my wordscapes. I'm super addicted. And I've honestly gotten to where I can beat

22:24.880 --> 22:30.960
some of the harder levels in like 15 seconds. Because I'm a word nerd.

22:31.920 --> 22:37.600
Um, and then we watched a couple of documentaries. One was on the

22:37.600 --> 22:44.000
entire history of Samus Aran. And the other one was on the history of the Star Fox series.

22:45.040 --> 22:49.600
Which actually makes me really disappointed that Star Fox Zero wasn't a better game.

22:50.160 --> 22:55.920
Because it was beautiful. That's it. Oh, one more thing. One more thing.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.240
Okay, we have we have the Beatlemania Pinball Table by Stern.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.200
Oh, yeah. Didn't you mention last week you traded for it?

23:04.400 --> 23:09.040
We did. And I actually finally played it. And it goes sometimes from being a complete

23:09.680 --> 23:12.400
proper gentleman to being a right arsehole.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.680
Love it. By the way, a fashion comment from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network,

23:19.680 --> 23:23.120
Garth the Wolf in chat saying Jamie, I love that your hair matches your glasses.

23:23.760 --> 23:28.400
And for the those in the podcast feed they do and the lipstick I think matches to the darker color

23:28.400 --> 23:34.160
of the glasses a little bit more purpley. The color is called hold on I have it with me.

23:35.120 --> 23:41.360
Orchis by color pop. And for those looking, it is very dark.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Bobby wants to know what you traded for Beatlemania.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.320
Well, it was a temporary trade. We traded Indianapolis.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.220
Hmm.

23:50.400 --> 23:56.240
Um, so no, we traded racing for for classic early rock.

23:56.800 --> 24:03.120
But I love that table so much those Beatles your local community that like Dan participates in

24:03.120 --> 24:08.800
they trade tables for like the sake of just having different stuff in and out of the house.

24:08.800 --> 24:13.280
Yeah, let's say Yeah, trading Nintendo cartridges. Exactly. It's not always a value based trade

24:13.280 --> 24:17.440
necessarily. Like, you just kind of all know each other and you know, you're all good for it.

24:17.440 --> 24:17.940
Basically.

24:19.120 --> 24:25.520
Yeah, and I mean, it's, it's not like we haven't done permatrades before for equal value.

24:26.160 --> 24:32.080
You know, it's just that, you know, everybody in the community loves their tables and we know

24:32.080 --> 24:37.360
everybody else loves their tables. And so like, there's even like trade work that goes on from

24:37.360 --> 24:44.880
time to time too. But, but at this point, you know, we, the people that we will trade with

24:44.880 --> 24:51.200
know that we will take care of their babies. Yeah. And it's a good way to experience a table

24:51.200 --> 24:57.520
you might not have otherwise experienced. Yeah. Good call. All right. I can't wait to get where

24:57.520 --> 25:03.280
now. Oh. All right. Well, let's move on and talk to Loki about his gaming week. How was your gaming

25:03.280 --> 25:11.840
week? Loki is just Minecraft again. I mean, as as his tradition, I was mostly playing my modded

25:12.480 --> 25:18.080
version. So the monsters of mechanics stuff, I'm just trying to set up my next build. So I

25:18.080 --> 25:23.680
finished designing it finally this week. And I've been gathering materials and, and figuring out

25:23.680 --> 25:29.920
different mod conflicts, because we had a problem with a mod they had added in where now I couldn't

25:29.920 --> 25:37.200
claim ladders, for some reason. And it's a really weird mod to cause that problem, but it did. So I

25:37.200 --> 25:44.000
figured it out and took it out. But yeah, it's been it's been a lot of fun. I've been having

25:44.000 --> 25:48.720
some fun with it. I'm still disappointed that it's taken me so long to get an episode out

25:48.720 --> 25:54.560
under that series right now. And then I know going into like, the actual S&P stuff for channel 64.

25:55.920 --> 26:01.760
That's gonna take a while to because what I need to design next is a, I think it's I think I'm

26:02.720 --> 26:09.680
doing too much is what I think I'm doing. Because I look at like, for example, hermit craft and like

26:09.680 --> 26:16.560
mumbo jumbo is the guy that just came back off of like an eight month hiatus. And he like,

26:16.560 --> 26:23.680
literally worked on like a teeny, teeny, teeny tiny part of his base. And he didn't even finish

26:23.680 --> 26:29.120
it. He like continue working on it from like the previous episode. And like here, I look at the

26:29.120 --> 26:35.440
stuff I'm building. It's like, like a whole mega vase size, like build every episode. And I think

26:35.440 --> 26:42.320
it's too much. I'm doing too much. So it takes like four times as long, which I don't know if

26:42.320 --> 26:49.200
that's good or bad. But like, it's just I want it to be more frequent. But I don't know how to

26:49.200 --> 26:53.760
divide it up enough to where I can be able to do that on a regular basis. So that's gonna be

26:53.760 --> 26:58.720
something for next season to figure out and stuff. But we got more news today about like,

26:58.800 --> 27:03.360
or not this today, but this week about the new Minecraft version. So they added like,

27:04.720 --> 27:09.680
cherry blossom forest type thing as like a new biome and stuff. So that's kind of neat.

27:11.280 --> 27:16.080
Yeah, but yeah, my mod series liking it. It's been a lot of fun. All right.

27:18.160 --> 27:23.200
My gaming week. So early on, it was a lot of the similar stuff I always talk about on the show,

27:23.200 --> 27:27.520
like Final Fantasy 14. I've been trying to get the trophies on the PlayStation five version,

27:27.520 --> 27:32.720
because 14 on the PlayStation five has separate trophies from the PlayStation four and PlayStation

27:32.720 --> 27:36.720
three loads. So that's been kind of fun to go through that. I played a little bit of crash

27:36.720 --> 27:41.040
bandicoot the trilogy I played a little bit of the first game because that was one of the games

27:41.040 --> 27:44.960
I just loaded onto my PlayStation five because I was like I picked that up and PlayStation Plus

27:44.960 --> 27:50.000
at some point just never really played it. So I played a little bit of that. And then dead by

27:50.000 --> 27:55.280
daylight just a little bit not a lot saw the latest info about the new killer and you know,

27:55.920 --> 28:00.400
I mean, it looks all right. I don't know how well balanced that killer is going to be.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.280
The new survivors are more interesting than the new killer, quite frankly.

28:03.280 --> 28:07.280
The killer is really cool, but her Mori is crap.

28:07.280 --> 28:13.440
The killer is a well designed character. I'm just not sure I'm into them as a killer,

28:13.440 --> 28:17.920
but we'll see. I mean, they also tend to change things before the actual release. So we'll see.

28:17.920 --> 28:23.600
I think she'll get a more interesting Mori but I really do like the the drone mechanic.

28:24.320 --> 28:27.920
Oh, I will say this about that new killer as long as we're going to derail by daylight.

28:29.680 --> 28:34.960
A lot of people were compared actually I really whoever said I'm sorry, some streamer said

28:34.960 --> 28:39.200
their mechanics really remind them of the predator. And I was like,

28:39.200 --> 28:44.000
that's a really interesting call out because predator DLC has been rumored for a long time.

28:44.720 --> 28:50.480
Holly Esther did a video on if she was supposed to be predator or not.

28:51.200 --> 28:55.440
And then I look at her face. And a lot of people say, oh, she's like Terminator,

28:55.440 --> 29:00.560
she's like a T2 robot type of thing. And I could maybe see that type thing too. But you know what

29:00.560 --> 29:09.280
she really looks like to me? Fem Kano. She's Fem Kano. She's not Kano, she's Kana. That's Kana.

29:10.640 --> 29:14.800
That is that is what she is to me. She's Kano with the lasers and everything. That's her.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.920
And that's why her Mori should be a laser burn like Kano's thing or the heart thing or something.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.600
She's wearing a mask and it's not built into her. All of her stuff is add on.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.680
I know, but it still reminds me of that.

29:26.400 --> 29:32.400
But I was in a polyester stream when the PTB went live. You know, just hanging out and chatting and

29:32.400 --> 29:39.600
watching the new killer. And there was a person who's like, yeah, she's like, X23,

29:39.600 --> 29:48.640
who is now Wolverine for the record, there's two Wolverines, meets something else, you know.

29:49.360 --> 29:54.880
And I was like, I don't know. I mean, they were just saying that she was way too derivative.

29:54.880 --> 30:05.920
But I went and I actually ripped the model out of the game files. I actually went and downloaded

30:05.920 --> 30:12.880
all of the game models so that I would have this PTBs worth of models. And when I put her together,

30:13.520 --> 30:21.520
there's a lot of really good detail on her weapon that makes it look like something that she did

30:21.520 --> 30:25.600
build herself. And I think that the best description of her is anti Batman.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.520
Yeah, yeah. Oh, she's very anti Batman. But anyway,

30:29.520 --> 30:31.840
She's like Batman, but a serial killer.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.320
So anyway, Brazilian.

30:35.200 --> 30:40.480
Yeah, yeah, it's all Brazilian pack, basically, because the survivors are a Brazilian brother

30:41.120 --> 30:45.440
and sister too. So you know, fun to have different countries represented and all that.

30:46.640 --> 30:51.760
So anyway, the bulk of my gaming week is they're easily calling out in the chat right now over

30:51.760 --> 30:56.080
twitch.tv slash vog network, I've been playing this shit out of theater them final bar line,

30:56.080 --> 31:01.440
because that released the middle of this week for PlayStation four and switch and I did pick

31:01.440 --> 31:06.480
it up on PlayStation five backwards compatible PlayStation four, obviously. So I've been playing

31:06.480 --> 31:11.520
a bit of that I had a little trouble getting it up and running. Something I found out was that the

31:12.320 --> 31:17.920
3.0 dashboard beta for the PlayStation five, which I guess they were giving away codes that

31:17.920 --> 31:22.480
you could give to your friends. So you know, Shane hooked me up with a code. And I installed that we

31:22.480 --> 31:28.560
actually the beta dashboard is nice, because we were using discord on the PlayStation, as I was

31:28.560 --> 31:33.280
getting my trophies unlocked and Final Fantasy 14 and all that. So there are good things about that

31:33.280 --> 31:38.960
beta. But the bad thing is, it prevented theater them from unlocking on time. And it took me a

31:38.960 --> 31:42.640
little bit to figure that out. And I was doing this all live. And I'd promised Oh, we're gonna

31:42.640 --> 31:47.280
go in theater them right as its launches are going to be live. And of course, I get held up for 30

31:47.280 --> 31:52.000
minutes trying to diagnose why it's not running. Finally, we figure out it's the beta. So anyway,

31:52.000 --> 31:57.760
I hope they fix that for future releases, because that was annoying to say the least. But once I got

31:57.760 --> 32:03.440
and that that's not a Square Enix problem. That's a Sony beta problem. And in complete fairness,

32:03.440 --> 32:07.520
because somebody actually asked him I chat when that happened, like, Oh, are you gonna, you know,

32:07.520 --> 32:12.640
tweet at Sony and you know, complain at him for what's going on. And I'm like, like, honestly,

32:13.360 --> 32:20.240
this is why when you sign up for a beta, they warn you many times, the beta may be unstable,

32:20.240 --> 32:25.120
you're in a beta for a reason to find problems like what I found the other night. So there's

32:25.120 --> 32:31.600
really nobody to complain to. I fucked around and I found out so to speak, except you know,

32:31.600 --> 32:35.760
I wasn't doing anything wrong. But that is just there are pitfalls to doing betas. And that is

32:35.760 --> 32:40.640
one of them. So there's nobody to complain to. Luckily, it's very easy to revert. So I actually

32:40.640 --> 32:45.920
give Sony credit for that it was very easy to revert and be able to get in the game right away

32:45.920 --> 32:51.200
for that. So I've been playing the shit out of theater them. Every second of the game I've played

32:51.200 --> 32:55.360
I've streamed so I played like three hours on Wednesday night, three hours on Thursday night,

32:55.360 --> 32:59.920
four hours last night. I don't usually stream for more than four hours. But last night was

32:59.920 --> 33:06.240
an exception. There's a definite lack of Angela Aki. I know you're so pressed about that. But

33:06.240 --> 33:12.560
there's there's a lot of strange omissions. Considering that there are over 500 songs when

33:12.560 --> 33:18.320
you count all the DLC and stuff. It does make the omissions stand out that much more. But I

33:18.320 --> 33:23.280
understand that there are licensing issues and things like that. For you know, for you,

33:23.280 --> 33:27.600
you're missing that song. For me, I was disappointed. They don't have any Endwalker

33:27.600 --> 33:32.560
stuff from Final Fantasy 14. Because like close in the distance is one of the most amazing songs

33:32.560 --> 33:36.400
ever written for a video game. And the fact that that's not in there is tragic. But maybe it'll be

33:36.400 --> 33:45.760
DLC later. Who knows? The old da music like the the levels. I my favorite music in 14. I don't

33:45.760 --> 33:51.920
know if old old does in there. I'd have to look at the list. So but they have like status. Yeah,

33:51.920 --> 33:55.920
that's my favorite music in the entire game so far. There's a there's a lot of songs that are

33:55.920 --> 34:00.160
missing. But there are a lot of songs that are in it. And I have to say overall, I don't want to

34:00.160 --> 34:04.560
dwell on these missing songs because honestly, the game is incredible. Those those omissions aside,

34:04.560 --> 34:11.760
like you know, things that are my jam Final Fantasy games, music games, retro games. This

34:11.760 --> 34:16.960
really hits on all those points. And obviously, this is a formula that started 10 years ago,

34:16.960 --> 34:21.360
I'm thrilled that I can play it on a non portable console now, being that it's on PlayStation,

34:21.360 --> 34:26.480
not that I hate portable gaming, I just tend to play living room style games more often. And so

34:26.480 --> 34:33.760
I'm thrilled that that's there. The only thing that gets a little bit wonky versus the DS are

34:33.760 --> 34:38.880
the green control paths. They're really simplified since there's no stylus to trace with. It's just

34:38.880 --> 34:43.920
kind of up and down. But the arcade version wasn't that much different all things considered.

34:43.920 --> 34:48.240
I mean, it did have sensitivity, but you know, it's not too much of a departure from what it

34:48.240 --> 34:51.680
was the arcade. And I think that's kind of what they were doing with this is they were really

34:51.680 --> 34:55.840
trying to put all the music that they've done over the years, not just for the DS versions,

34:55.840 --> 35:00.800
but for the arcade version, because a lot of those 14 songs were in the arcade version.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.800
And they've kind of made like a definitive edition of this game because the arcade version

35:04.800 --> 35:09.360
no longer has the online access. So this is kind of a way for fans of the arcade version,

35:09.360 --> 35:13.680
as well as the DS version to have one last hurrah. They are saying it's the last one.

35:14.240 --> 35:20.560
But we'll see. I mean, it seems like, you know, again, it might just be bias of the people around

35:20.560 --> 35:27.840
me or the people I follow on social media. I know way more people that spent $100 on the digital

35:27.840 --> 35:34.160
deluxe edition for theater them, then actually bought for spoken. And I'm sorry to be shady,

35:34.160 --> 35:38.560
because I haven't played at all for spoken. I don't know if it's a good game or a bad game.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.640
But I'm just saying for all the marketing and all the push that Square Enix put into that game,

35:42.640 --> 35:48.240
I feel like this other little game sitting over here is just selling not just copies,

35:48.240 --> 35:54.240
but collector's edition copies, basically, essentially. So, and st 100, Matt and chat says

35:54.240 --> 35:58.480
would be cool if they added some Enix deep cuts, like it would be cool to hear some Actraiser in

35:58.480 --> 36:03.280
there. Some of the songs they have coming for digital deluxe are great. Chrono Trigger and

36:03.280 --> 36:08.800
Chrono Cross will be represented in a pack near automata. That alone, the fact that I'm going to

36:08.800 --> 36:16.240
get to play way to the world is amazing. And live live is going to be pretty soon. I think it's the

36:16.240 --> 36:21.440
next one coming. The first DLC pack was like two songs from Final Fantasy adventure. And then

36:21.440 --> 36:28.240
Romancing Saga had some songs. I know Secret of Mana is on the deck at some point too. But not

36:28.240 --> 36:34.480
Secret of Evermore, frown, because you know, some are complicated. It's it's weird, because there

36:34.480 --> 36:40.720
are some Final Fantasy games that are represented that you literally can't play anymore. Final

36:40.720 --> 36:46.240
Fantasy Mobius, Final Fantasy Record Keeper, those mobile games that are no longer supported. This is

36:46.240 --> 36:51.760
pretty much all that exists of them now, which is interesting. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest has eight

36:51.760 --> 36:56.480
songs represented, which is great because the soundtrack was the best part of Final Fantasy

36:56.480 --> 37:04.080
Mystic Quest, quite honestly. So it's astounding that that's there. That's great. So yeah, it's

37:04.080 --> 37:08.720
really fun to play along with the songs. There's a whole little meta game going on. You have

37:08.720 --> 37:13.760
characters that you level as you play songs, and then you use those characters to complete quests.

37:13.760 --> 37:17.920
You see this whole little background thing going on. And it looks like it's just idle background

37:17.920 --> 37:23.920
animation at first until you realize that no, this game is actually going based on the success of

37:23.920 --> 37:28.960
your notes and the things that you've equipped to your characters that like, oh, maybe cloud will do

37:28.960 --> 37:34.800
a braver attack after you hit 50 critical notes in a row. Like and you have to build this to be able

37:34.800 --> 37:39.040
to finish quests in the game. So this, there's definitely it wouldn't be a Final Fantasy game if

37:39.120 --> 37:44.400
there wasn't some type of grind to go with it. So they've definitely built that into the game.

37:44.400 --> 37:50.240
Apparently, not only can you level the 99, but then you can get stars after level 99. So you

37:50.240 --> 37:58.320
literally have tons and tons of stuff to grind in that game. Garth the Wolf, I know you love Near.

37:58.880 --> 38:06.160
What is the song with the robots and the boss where it goes, this cannot continue, this cannot

38:06.160 --> 38:10.800
continue, and then it starts to get all like dancy as you're fighting the boss. That song

38:10.800 --> 38:17.280
fucks. And I hope that is in the theater them near DLC pack because that was probably my favorite

38:17.280 --> 38:22.800
song that was in the just just the way it turned the computer. Like as you're playing the game,

38:22.800 --> 38:28.480
the way it turned like what was happening into the game into the music was like incredible. So

38:28.480 --> 38:32.240
Birth of a Wish. That's right. Because I know I've looked that up on YouTube before. Birth of a Wish.

38:32.240 --> 38:38.800
I hope that songs in there. So yeah, it's an alternate there because the Japanese version does

38:38.800 --> 38:43.680
the same thing. Although they're saying a phrase in Japanese instead. But it does. It's the same

38:44.480 --> 38:50.880
trick. So it's very cool. Anyway. Alright, so I don't I don't know what else to say about

38:50.880 --> 38:55.360
theater them. Like if you like music games, if you like Final Fantasy games, you've probably

38:55.360 --> 38:59.280
already bought the $100 edition. I you don't need to hear any more from me. But then again, I will

38:59.520 --> 39:06.000
say since I've been streaming the game so much. I have actually had two people tell me I bought

39:06.000 --> 39:09.840
this game from watching you play the stream. Thanks for showing me what this game is all

39:09.840 --> 39:15.920
about to which I say influencer. Where's my code next Times Square? Where's my code?

39:18.480 --> 39:22.480
Oh, maybe two and a half SSJ 100 Matt says maybe I'll get this sometime down the road.

39:22.480 --> 39:28.320
I will say there is a multiplayer. I only played it a little bit. But it's kind of it's kind of

39:28.320 --> 39:35.120
neat. I like that, you know, they put I don't like all the little like, oh, the fat chocobos

39:35.120 --> 39:41.200
hide the lane, or extra squares and triangles get in there or you know, I don't like all those silly

39:41.200 --> 39:45.680
little moves. But you can actually play multiplayer with those off. So I do like how

39:45.680 --> 39:49.600
highly customizable it is. Actually, on the customizable note, I'll let this be my final

39:49.600 --> 39:54.240
thought on theater them and then we'll move on. On the customizable note. I do love like there's

39:54.240 --> 39:59.360
four levels of difficulty, right? Basic and then expert is actually the medium difficulty ultimate

39:59.360 --> 40:04.960
and then like, you're sick. I don't know what the last level is called. But to me, it's you're sick.

40:04.960 --> 40:11.200
Those are like the 17 level songs. You can actually play the songs on your sick mode in

40:11.200 --> 40:18.320
simple mode. And how does that work? It takes out all of the yellow flicks, because there's parts of

40:18.320 --> 40:22.880
the song where you have to flick the little controller in the direction and the whole it

40:22.880 --> 40:28.240
takes all of those out. So you're only hitting button presses. So for some people, that might

40:28.240 --> 40:33.040
be easier than trying to do. Oh, thank you. Supreme is what it's called. Not the your sick mode.

40:33.040 --> 40:40.080
Um, but yeah, that's cool. But the only downside to that whole thing is that it is not cross

40:40.080 --> 40:47.120
platform. So the Switch version and the PlayStation version are on islands, you can't

40:47.120 --> 40:53.280
even trade cards profile cards with people on the other platform, which is a bummer. But that's my

40:53.280 --> 40:59.520
one little. I wish they did this different, but I also kind of get it. Ah, boo. Bobby Black Wolf says

40:59.520 --> 41:06.880
birth of a wish is not in the near pack. Damn it. So good. All right. So you know, they're even

41:06.880 --> 41:12.080
though they say it's the final one. Look, we keep naming songs where it's like even though 500 songs

41:12.080 --> 41:17.680
are represented. I mean, if you if you like battle on the big bridge from Final Fantasy Five, let me

41:17.680 --> 41:23.600
tell you, the Gilgamesh song is remixed like six different times in this game, you will not be

41:23.600 --> 41:31.440
disappointed by the amount of Greg in this game. But there are still some omissions. So if they

41:31.440 --> 41:36.640
ever wanted to do a theater them on core or whatever the fuck they want to call it. There's

41:36.640 --> 41:41.040
still some songs they could put in it. And I think the real gag would be put Kingdom Hearts in it

41:41.040 --> 41:46.560
because Melody of Memories was not it. Put Kingdom Hearts in theater them you cowards.

41:46.560 --> 41:54.080
Or you know what? Give us fucking Dragon Quest. Bring the Dragon Quest game out locally. Look,

41:54.080 --> 41:58.480
I know you didn't do it here because you haven't released Dragon Quest 10 here and you want to

41:58.480 --> 42:03.040
pretend we don't know that Dragon Quest 10 is a game even though you've literally released 9 and

42:03.040 --> 42:10.640
11 like Square. We know. We know. And Square Enix also put out an offline version of Dragon Quest 10

42:10.640 --> 42:16.080
in Japan. Why they have not brought that over here still? I don't know. But the Dragon Quest

42:16.080 --> 42:21.760
game would be great. And lots of other stuff. Anyway, Garth the Wolf in chat says the nail in

42:21.760 --> 42:26.160
the coffin for the Kingdom Hearts rhythm game is no Utada songs were in it. I'm gonna tell you

42:26.160 --> 42:32.480
what the nail in that coffin game was was allowing Nomura or whoever's idea it was to say, well, but

42:32.480 --> 42:41.040
this is Kingdom Hearts. We need to change the theater them formula. Bad move. Because that game

42:41.040 --> 42:48.800
is not it. But if they want to go back and you know what put in the theater them stuff. As Joe

42:48.800 --> 42:56.160
and Hunter Matt says, as final as BeatMania the final that theater them 2DX. Make it happen.

42:57.200 --> 43:02.160
Well, we have a story later on in the show where maybe we will see theater them in another form.

43:02.160 --> 43:06.560
But I will wait until we get that back or until we get to that part of the show. In the meantime,

43:06.560 --> 43:11.360
we have some stories to get into. I am gonna let Loki have it with this first story tonight.

43:12.640 --> 43:16.400
Yes, let's talk about all the good news with Activision Blizzard. Just kidding. There's

43:16.400 --> 43:21.920
no good news. It's never good news. It's Activision Blizzard. So we have statements

43:21.920 --> 43:30.480
being made by Mike Ybarra of Blizzard as part of a company wide QA. Some of the things that he did

43:30.480 --> 43:37.520
was downplay the stack ranking that was something that was brought up by one developers that was

43:37.520 --> 43:43.440
leaving the company. Basically saying, you know, we don't stack rank employees one through exit

43:43.440 --> 43:47.280
Blizzard, we have a high expectations over teams manager set goals, blah, blah, blah.

43:48.880 --> 43:55.520
That doesn't seem to necessarily reflect the the opinions of folks that are leaving the company

43:55.520 --> 44:02.480
because of that reason. But you know, along with that, you know, he also said something

44:02.480 --> 44:06.480
to the effect that if you think that executives are making a lot of money and you aren't,

44:06.480 --> 44:12.560
you're living in a myth. Like, like executives at Activision Blizzard aren't making a lot of money.

44:12.560 --> 44:17.920
I don't believe that. At the end of the day, we want people to be happy and decisions about

44:17.920 --> 44:24.240
being happy don't align with with where we're going. And you won't be happy, then you you'll

44:24.240 --> 44:29.200
have to do will make you happy. In other words, we're going to do what we want. And you got to

44:29.200 --> 44:38.240
get out of here. Other fun stuff that they've been talking about as well. They're making their

44:38.240 --> 44:45.200
employees go back to the office, because everybody loves that. Hey, you like remote work, go back to

44:45.200 --> 44:50.640
the office. Because in my opinion, they just probably can't sexually harass the people

44:50.640 --> 44:53.920
remotely. So they got to bring people in the office so they can continue with their bad

44:53.920 --> 45:01.360
behavior to begin with. That's a little much. I have a comment about that I had been off for

45:01.360 --> 45:08.240
however many about six months I'd gone shopping. I've been wearing my mask. I didn't go out for a

45:08.240 --> 45:16.080
week. I went back in the office for two days and got COVID. Yeah, I don't know why anyone would

45:16.080 --> 45:23.040
want to go back. We had a I know, like the company I work at, we're allegedly permanently remote,

45:23.040 --> 45:28.160
because they don't have the office space anymore. They leased it out or sold it or whatever,

45:29.120 --> 45:34.320
which is good. But there's like a like, a handful of people, actually, I should say like,

45:34.320 --> 45:38.800
two that wanted to work in the office. And so now because of that, they're doing this thing,

45:38.800 --> 45:42.960
like once a month where they, they go back in the office, and it's not even like a team building

45:42.960 --> 45:46.560
thing. It's just we're just going to work in the office one day. And it's such a hassle because

45:46.560 --> 45:51.120
you got to like lug all of your equipment over there. You have to reserve a spot because they

45:51.120 --> 45:56.640
don't have a scientific anymore. And you have to expose yourself to all these people that are just

45:56.640 --> 46:01.360
terrible. I kind of want to do that. You know, it's interesting. Alan and I work at the same

46:01.360 --> 46:05.360
place. I'm not going to say much more than that on air. We do very different jobs. Alan actually

46:05.360 --> 46:10.880
goes into the office by choice. Our company is also remote like that. But two things that are

46:10.880 --> 46:15.520
important in context. Number one, we live less than a mile from the home office. So commuting

46:15.520 --> 46:20.240
really isn't a problem. And number two, Alan is very much like, when I'm done with work,

46:20.240 --> 46:24.160
I want to get up and walk away and physically leave my work. And I'm kind of like, I respect

46:24.160 --> 46:29.600
that. Like, yeah, I get that. So you know, when it's convenient for him to do, I get that. But

46:30.240 --> 46:35.040
I feel like it's like maybe him and one other person in that very large area that

46:36.000 --> 46:42.960
that the work is our work is starting to get rid of spaces to and leasing or whatever. So

46:43.680 --> 46:49.280
very, very interesting. Now for the company that I work at, because our culture is very different

46:49.280 --> 46:54.240
from a lot of corporate cultures. And people who know me know where I work, but I'm not saying it

46:54.240 --> 47:01.920
on the air again. Um, the culture of my work is built around discussion and debate, and an

47:01.920 --> 47:12.480
exchange of ideas and having individual expertise. So I understand why our culture dictates having

47:12.480 --> 47:21.120
people together. At the same time, for those of us who have been doing other services within

47:21.120 --> 47:27.680
the company who aren't in the management realm or the decision making realm, or the production

47:27.680 --> 47:34.880
realm, I, I don't see a need for it. You know, we we have a slack channel, I interact with my

47:34.880 --> 47:40.640
co workers that way, I reach out to managers and departments that I want to eventually join and

47:40.640 --> 47:46.960
make friends with them. You know, I learned about everything, we can still reach out and have that

47:46.960 --> 47:56.560
spirit of communication without actually sharing the same space. And we're back on a on a hybrid.

47:57.360 --> 48:05.600
So we go in, no matter what your schedule are, everybody, if they are working a Tuesday,

48:05.600 --> 48:11.120
Wednesday or Thursday, they go into the office. So for me, that means that like on my schedule now,

48:11.120 --> 48:14.800
my Wednesdays and Thursdays are spent in office and my Friday and Saturday is worked at home.

48:15.680 --> 48:27.440
Um, it's, I'm fine with a hybrid schedule, but I still think that there's the sense of denial

48:27.440 --> 48:35.520
about the overall necessity and safety and going back into the office. And I think especially

48:35.520 --> 48:42.720
because the pandemic is not over. I will repeat that the pandemic is not over.

48:43.600 --> 48:50.560
And that is still not the time to be forcing people to go into these environments, harassment,

48:50.560 --> 48:57.360
you know, apart from from that, which by the way, at my work, our, our corporate training

48:57.360 --> 49:07.600
on harassment has really stepped up its game since this whole thing has gone on. But I think

49:07.680 --> 49:15.200
I think that given that baseline that every company is having to deal with,

49:15.760 --> 49:21.360
and then given the environment of this particular volatile company,

49:23.200 --> 49:28.480
they're making a really bad call. And not just that, but like their performance

49:30.080 --> 49:36.400
reviews, the the questionnaire they sent out to their employees. I've talked to a few people

49:37.360 --> 49:45.040
this bullshit. Yeah, I mean, we have we have a ranking for like choosing our schedules

49:45.040 --> 49:52.080
based on performance. But I think that this company is also still being resistant about

49:52.080 --> 49:58.400
people discussing their pay, which by the way, no matter what employer tells you not to discuss

49:58.400 --> 50:04.400
your pay, you have a legal right to and everyone should be transparent about what they make and

50:04.480 --> 50:10.560
discuss it with others. You need to be paid what you're fucking worth. But going back,

50:10.560 --> 50:23.760
but going back to to that, you know, it's it's really this the state of corporate control,

50:23.760 --> 50:31.040
I think is what it goes over. They want to have more control over what their employees are doing,

50:31.040 --> 50:36.320
be able to observe them, especially given the resistance of Activision Blizzard to

50:38.480 --> 50:45.680
recent unionization attempts. I think what they're doing really wrong here is that and this is for

50:45.680 --> 50:49.920
any company, really not just Activision Blizzard. But if you want to pull people back into the

50:49.920 --> 50:55.840
office, you really have to explain the why the what's in it for them. Why is the company doing

50:55.840 --> 51:02.720
this? What is the reason besides, and just people work better in person is not an acceptable reason,

51:02.720 --> 51:07.440
because these companies did not go bankrupt in the last three years, they've weathered the pandemic.

51:07.440 --> 51:13.120
So you have to be able to explain the why. And until you can do that, to an audience,

51:13.120 --> 51:16.720
it's already a little bit unhappy with a lot of your business practices,

51:16.720 --> 51:19.920
you're not going to win your employees over. And it's as simple as that.

51:19.920 --> 51:26.640
Yeah, and I like it at my job, because they have a legitimate reason as to why.

51:27.920 --> 51:30.960
Just, you know, because is not a reason, right?

51:32.400 --> 51:37.040
Loki, yeah. And to and to that point, you know, the majority of them don't want to go back to

51:37.040 --> 51:42.880
the office full time or part time, they still feel that the risks don't outweigh the benefits.

51:42.880 --> 51:48.000
On top of that, you know, further work from home arrangements, they said have resulted employees

51:48.000 --> 51:54.720
having more time since they aren't losing and commute, lower gas insurance costs. And, you know,

51:54.720 --> 52:02.160
as well as the ability to live further away from the office. Also, you know, there's childcare,

52:02.160 --> 52:07.280
schooling, all that stuff, like, I completely understand that. And I know, like, some of,

52:07.280 --> 52:10.800
like, especially the company I work for leadership has tried to make the argument like,

52:10.800 --> 52:16.560
well, in person, you know, it like, it's, it'll help out with like, some of the issues that are

52:16.560 --> 52:20.400
going on with like, poor training and stuff. And I have to remind them like, yeah, but this has

52:20.400 --> 52:26.160
been going on, like, well, before we went out on the pandemic, like, this is not going to change

52:26.160 --> 52:29.680
if we're in the office, and they will know what we do anyways, even if we were in office. So

52:30.320 --> 52:36.640
it's, yeah, it's, it's unfortunate. I know a lot of companies are kind of like, trying to

52:37.280 --> 52:40.800
force this a little bit. I don't think it's a good idea.

52:41.440 --> 52:41.940
Hmm.

52:43.280 --> 52:48.560
Well, we'll see. I mean, this doesn't really change until these employees start leaving,

52:49.120 --> 52:55.920
unionize, let their voices, you know, be let some actions speak behind those voices. I'm not saying,

52:55.920 --> 53:00.720
and I'm not saying they need to or they have to or whatever. I'm just saying, like, unfortunately,

53:01.520 --> 53:05.840
management is very clearly not hearing them. And it's not until these sorts of and this could be

53:05.840 --> 53:09.440
any company like today, it's about Activision Blizzard tomorrow, it'll be about somebody else

53:09.440 --> 53:17.520
in the industry, this insert company here. If they don't, you know, start making these changes,

53:18.080 --> 53:22.560
then some other company that does these types of things is going to snatch them up.

53:23.680 --> 53:27.280
Phil and I in in chat says, Oh, I heard from a bliss friend, they were not happy with the

53:27.280 --> 53:33.600
decision. And that's when you start, what do they call that rage applying? When you just I'm just

53:33.600 --> 53:38.800
going to start applying to other jobs and see what happens. That's when that I mean, heck,

53:38.800 --> 53:43.360
I left a company I was with for 14 years because I was under the belief my job was going to be

53:43.360 --> 53:51.040
outsourced. It actually never was outsourced. But I because of some actions and things I was

53:51.040 --> 53:54.880
convinced and other people had been outsourced. I was convinced it was going to be so I started

53:54.880 --> 53:58.560
rage applying and guess what I got a job where I made more money. So I left.

53:59.280 --> 54:03.680
Yeah, like if I can complain for a few seconds, I could actually complain for a lot longer than

54:03.680 --> 54:11.440
that. But like, I will keep it short. For example, I've I've been complaining that like,

54:11.440 --> 54:16.320
obviously, you feel very overworked. I'm doing a lot more work that feels like outside of my

54:16.320 --> 54:21.760
job description. And I've been at the company for at least in this position for like over seven

54:21.760 --> 54:29.200
years. And I am literally making the state mandated minimum wage for an exempt employee,

54:29.200 --> 54:33.920
seven years of experience in this department, integral to the running of this department,

54:34.560 --> 54:43.280
two of my employees, same, same everything. They left to go to another department, they're hiring

54:43.280 --> 54:47.680
two new employees in those people with zero experience in this position will be making

54:47.680 --> 54:51.680
the same amount of money as I am. There is nothing that they're going to do for me.

54:52.720 --> 54:56.480
They basically said, Well, if you want more money, you're probably going to,

54:56.880 --> 55:00.640
you're being compensated fairly. And if you want more money, you probably have to get look outside

55:00.640 --> 55:09.680
of the department. So like, it's just, they've been, they've been walking on eggshells around

55:09.680 --> 55:14.720
me because I've just I've lost all patience for everything with them. Like a night.

55:15.680 --> 55:22.880
As the last promotion I got at that job that I was at for 14 years, I got that promotion because

55:22.880 --> 55:28.640
I bid for a different department and I got offered the job and I said, I'm leaving because

55:29.440 --> 55:34.480
I'm not getting promoted here. There's no movement in this department. I am for as much of these

55:34.480 --> 55:38.720
accolades that I get for what I do. And I have the facts back it up. I'm never getting promoted.

55:38.720 --> 55:43.440
I get a call back the next day. That's basically like, if you try, if you will pull your name from

55:43.440 --> 55:48.880
consideration for that, you can choose if you want to go this path or this path. It was wild.

55:48.880 --> 55:52.080
I couldn't, I couldn't believe that it happened that way. But it did.

55:52.080 --> 55:56.720
Yeah. And, and considering that these two, there's three people that were doing that role in that

55:56.720 --> 56:01.840
department. Now there's one, I am the one that knows all of the information. Not a good time

56:01.840 --> 56:07.840
to piss me off. Because if I leave your department screwed, it's gone. Because you have literally

56:07.840 --> 56:12.320
high level explanations of how to do things. I think you're gonna have to always apply and get

56:12.320 --> 56:17.440
the get the offer. And then they'll listen. If it's not too late. And it's right right into what

56:17.440 --> 56:21.920
as Joe and Matt says here in chat, we have a mental health crisis worldwide. I think folks

56:21.920 --> 56:25.680
have really found the comfort of being able to work from home. Because you have that flexibility

56:25.680 --> 56:30.720
to step away from your job in your own space, pet your cat, dog, etc. Take care of your kids. I

56:30.720 --> 56:35.680
don't know the best answer to fix or create a work balance. But I think rushing people back in and

56:35.680 --> 56:40.720
saying, well, if you don't like it, leave is a toxic strategy. Because guess and I'm adding to

56:40.720 --> 56:46.960
that comment saying because guess what they're getting ready to leave. Yeah, I actually like

56:47.040 --> 56:53.520
I'd only been back to work for like, maybe four days. It was my last day of training. And I was

56:53.520 --> 56:59.200
looking at the job site, there was a position that was there. That was totally up my alley.

56:59.840 --> 57:06.080
And it even said in the job description, you just have to meet some of these requirements. We want

57:06.080 --> 57:12.080
people who are completely different. It's like for a design prototyping group. And you better believe

57:12.080 --> 57:20.080
I touched up my resume, completely the style they want at work. And I had my app in, you know,

57:20.080 --> 57:26.000
and I'm gonna keep doing that. And I've even started looking at like industry jobs, like the

57:26.000 --> 57:32.720
one for the Pokemon company that I told you about the other day. And if I have to move, I will move

57:32.720 --> 57:38.800
because I'll be making the money. You know, they start off at like, for this one job, that's like

57:38.800 --> 57:45.360
stuff I do anyway, at like double my salary, just under double my salary. And I would move

57:45.360 --> 57:50.400
to Washington for that. We can still do all our we've been doing it virtually for how long?

57:51.120 --> 57:56.640
Since 2020. Really? So yeah, and, and it's not like, you know, I don't see you guys from time

57:56.640 --> 58:06.400
to time. But, but you know, I would, sometimes you just have to be done. Does that make sense?

58:06.480 --> 58:13.920
No, I get it. Yeah, you have to be willing to be done. And take, take that risk. And if you

58:14.720 --> 58:21.440
like the company that you work at and believe in the company, then you need to be also be

58:21.440 --> 58:28.160
willing to take brave steps to improve what you love. I have to always be critical of what you

58:28.160 --> 58:35.680
love. I have to say like, I, where I'm at now, I'm completely happy. I think that companies invested

58:35.680 --> 58:41.920
in me in a way that no other company I've worked at has before. I have met some of my career goals

58:41.920 --> 58:47.680
at this company. I'm being paid what I should be paid and, you know, have some good benefits to go

58:47.680 --> 58:52.240
with that. I have, I work with amazing people. Like I really can't complain. Like my day job

58:52.240 --> 58:58.000
is great. It's one thing you're not going to hear me complain about. So, will that still be the case

58:58.000 --> 59:05.440
in five, 10 years? That probably depends on if the CEO has changed and what type of work culture the

59:05.440 --> 59:10.560
new CEO would bring with them if they keep up the ideals of the current person. Because again,

59:10.560 --> 59:14.560
and we've said this since the very beginning of these Activision Blizzard stories, the culture

59:14.560 --> 59:20.560
comes from the top down. And that's why Bobby Kotick is unqualified to work in this industry.

59:20.560 --> 59:26.320
He is not qualified to be the CEO of a major company the way he is. But because of systems

59:26.320 --> 59:32.720
being set up the way they are, he's there. And that is what it is. But the culture really is

59:32.720 --> 59:38.560
set from the top down. And at least where I'm at now, I have the good fortune that we got a

59:38.560 --> 59:43.840
good guy at the helm that sets a good culture from the top down. And that is exactly why I like where

59:43.840 --> 59:52.080
I work. So. I like that about my job too. Yeah. All right, let's move on. And let's talk about

59:52.080 --> 59:56.880
other things going on in gaming. Let's talk about something that I'm not sure a lot of companies are

59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.440
on board for because we were talking about that a couple weeks ago on the show. But it sounds like

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:08.720
Ubisoft may be in to attend E3 2023. There was a report, of course, that came out a couple weeks

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.400
ago that said Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo won't be going to E3 in June. But one company that does

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:21.520
want to be there is Ubisoft. Speaking to investors, Yves Guillemonde, who also is not qualified to be

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:28.240
doing what he is doing, but here we are, said, if E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.040
lot of things to show. It was a very simple comment, but it obviously has turned a lot of

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.160
heads because that's one of the major publishers that is committing to E3. But what's interesting

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:47.520
about that, if E3 happens, you know, this is a good point to bring up. By the time our show comes

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:55.840
back in two weeks, it will be March 6th. That means there will be three months until June,

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:05.600
middle of June. 90 days is that sweet spot to book travel. If E3 is, so I'm going to assume

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.400
one of the storylines we're going to miss next week, or maybe we'll be able to touch it on the

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:16.800
March 6th show, but I'm almost certain in the next two weeks, we're going to have a go or a no go on

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.360
E3. They're either going to say it's happening, here it is, here's the time, and here's all the

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.960
people that are coming, Ubisoft, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Or we're going to get their

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.560
release. Ubisoft 3. It's E3. Three companies are coming.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.280
E3. Or they're going to put out the press release that says,

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.880
unfortunately, due to continued COVID concerns, we're canceling the show.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.400
Yeah. They'll blame COVID for sure.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.120
Because 100% they're not going to blame themselves.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.160
No.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:48.800
Who does that?

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.920
No. No.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.960
So, I think that's going to be an interesting thing to tell in the next couple of weeks.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:01.200
Because again, you can't expect, especially international coming from Japan, you cannot

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:08.000
expect those folks to make those types of travel plans less than three months in advance. This

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:16.000
thing, and if we come back in two weeks and E3 isn't confirmed or canceled, I'm in a different

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.920
state of what the fuck. Because I'm like, they're really going to try to pull off a

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:26.480
show with 60 days notice or something. That is ludicrous. But also another example of

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:32.720
how the ESA needs to get their shit together. And has been needed to get their shit together.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.960
Dr. C in chat says, I have to wonder what they'd even show.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.600
Rayman's main series been dead for a while. Don't hold out much hope for Assassin's Creed,

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.520
Splitter Cell, maybe Prince of Persia.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.120
Well, there's

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.800
Beyond Good and Evil. I'm just kidding.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:57.600
I was gonna say the there's a rumors of speculation, I guess. From insider gaming that

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:03.840
says basically Just Dance 2024, Assassin's Creed, Mirage of Nexus, The Division Heartland,

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:09.360
X Defiant, Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones. Again, the continuing saga.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.960
There's enough crap. That's what is there's enough crap.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.280
All right. But we'll see. We'll see. So I again, in two weeks, I expect we know what the summer

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.640
looks like. Because we don't know what the summer looks like 90 days out. I don't know what the fuck

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.000
this industry is doing right now. We'll see. All right, moving on Dark Sakura.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.640
Okay, so I'm going into a little bit more of a legal side of things.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.440
And this actually isn't like necessarily legal, but I have a feeling it could go that way.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:57.200
There is basically a limit that the UK is asking these companies to put on the data that they

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:05.920
gather from people who play different games. There is a report by the information commissioners

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:13.440
office that they want video games to to bolster and enforce age restriction. They stated that

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:18.320
video games should include a stronger age assurance features for those who are below 18.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.600
They've published a list of tips and recommendations on how developers

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:31.520
can go about this. Of course, it goes both ways. They say that the personal data of children should

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.560
only be collected and processed if it is not detrimental to their health or well-being.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.760
Going a little bit further into that, the ICO is recommending that any optional use of personal

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:54.160
data is set to off by default with consent being given by a parent or guardian. Product placement,

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:00.000
paid promotions, and collaborations should be monitored, especially in community servers.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:08.240
They want to put checkpoints like periodic saving of progress and natural breaks in play between

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:14.000
game matches into the game design. So that basically, you know, it was sort of like what

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.640
they were kind of trying to do with WoW. They're saying, you've been playing for a while. Do you

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:28.000
want a break? You know, so they want to put up explanations and prompts of steps if, especially

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.640
if like a child is trying to change the settings or maybe have something that goes back to the

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:40.800
adults, like also things like disabling voice chat. I mean, and I think that's reasonable,

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:48.320
you know, for younger kids. Yeah, I think it's not obscene what they're asking here.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.000
Yeah. And one of the things they even say, I'm looking at the guidelines, I'll just read this

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.680
verbatim. It's called buff your age assurance, know your players' ages. It says that the age

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.320
range of your players and the different needs of children at different ages and stages of

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.720
development should be at the heart of how you design your games and apply the code.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:19.600
So I think that having sort of a floating age level, you know, might be pretty good.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:26.640
There's another one on here about open world gameplay. So they're saying on here,

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:33.440
bad privacy information design obscures risks, unravels good player experiences,

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:39.840
and sows mistrust between children, parents, and game providers. You could run user research to

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.120
trial child-friendly privacy information with different age groups, display transparency

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.960
information on ability rather than age, you know, so like list at beginner, intermediate,

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:58.320
and expert levels, and design different communication methods for how to appropriately

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.000
relay information or in return gather information from children.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:10.960
They actually even did another thing on here looking this over about guidance to explain

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:18.800
how online services will spot detrimental use of children's data. And also the children's code

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.040
with guidance to help assess the best interest of children. There's another interesting one here

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:31.040
about stealth mode with high privacy settings and parental controls. And that's having to,

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.960
it's something that provides parents with real-time alerts about what their children

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.520
are playing or how long they've been playing. Or if the, you know, like I said before about

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.520
the child trying to change the privacy settings or, you know, different things like that.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:53.200
There's also, you know, giving parents the freedom to assess the maturity of their child,

01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:01.600
you know, and there's also a request to put in like a do not disturb setting,

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:11.600
you know, so that it would like not send like friend requests or to say it would disable voice

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:22.080
chat or allow only people of the same age group to communicate with children, you know,

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:32.480
offering profiling in game. And it's funny on here pushing FOMO. It says it is crucial that

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.840
games do not use nudge techniques to lead children to make poor privacy decisions.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.000
So basically eliminating the fear of missing out.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.040
And there's even ones on here where they're requesting people to volunteer as auditors.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.880
Oh, that's, that's where these issues get dicey when they invite the community to

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:59.840
arbitrate what is and what isn't appropriate. But I look at this more like doing like the Gallup

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:05.360
poll. I'm going to put this particular link here in in chat because at my old job when I worked

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:15.200
for the money store, I used to help with the Gallup feedback. And one of the good things I

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:22.000
like about that is that while this is gathered from communities participating in so such in the

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:30.960
other, and getting their opinion, it's something that is used by experts. So it's data, it's

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.400
information, it's feedback, it's complaining, I fully believe a complaint can be a gift,

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:44.080
because it's an opportunity to do better. At the at the same time, I think that the information

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.560
that comes from surveys like this or from, you know, community auditing should be implemented

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:57.200
by the people who are qualified to do so. I will be interesting to see what effect this

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.480
could have on future game development. There's gonna be something going in as

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.760
legislation before too long, because you know, people do like to pass their laws.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.040
And the UK is tending to regulate a lot of these things stricter than we are over here for sure.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.840
So you know, and obviously, the company I work for follows like European standards for privacy.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:23.360
Yeah. Most companies have to. Yeah. So that's why all the websites you go to now, like all of them

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.880
say like the cookie stuff that all came from the Europe laws, not the US laws. So yeah, and

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:36.480
I'm always like, No, I do not want you to target ads or do all this shit. I mean, one one thing I

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:43.520
actually super like about because I stopped using Chrome because Chrome is a resource hog. Like for

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:50.640
people who open different instances of Chrome or different tabs of Chrome, it is eating your RAM

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.760
and your processor, not me with five Chrome tabs open right now.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:02.640
I've actually gone back to just using Safari for everything. I mean, and it's not just because,

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:09.920
you know, I love my Mac, and it's a native app. But I've really gotten to where I like the fact

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:17.440
it records the trackers and blocks the majority of them. I keep ghostery open in the background as

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:28.560
well. And it's been between the two of those, I've really just enjoyed the greater sense of

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:38.160
privacy I've gotten from it. And, you know, but I when I was on my PC, I was using, I was using

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:44.240
Chrome because of the compatibility with stuff, but I started using Opera a lot more. And, you

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.160
know, and there's also I would even say, and this is going into general tips, make sure that your

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:58.160
search engine also has its own privacy protocols in place as well. Like a lot of people are fond

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:06.080
of DuckDuckGo. You know, even, you know, if you're really concerned about it, consider investing in

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:17.360
a VPN. Pretty cheap now. Yeah, like I have a VPN that I turn on by demand. And usually it's when I

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.600
want to look at stuff on the BBC website. I had to use one because my Comcast connection was that

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.720
shitty for playing Final Fantasy 14 at one point. But anyway, I digress. I mean, I have my work VPN

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:33.760
for when I work from home, but I really am a bigger advocate now of doing different things.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.080
Like since I stopped playing Stadia, I stopped using Chrome.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.120
All right. Because Stadia was only working in Chrome.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.400
Let's move on, though. We got to get the rest of the news. So let's get to our next story. So

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.920
funny enough, we brought up AI earlier in the show and now we have another story about AI.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:58.400
Yeah. So there's been a team from the University of Copenhagen who has put together a Mario GPT

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:05.920
that can generate levels in Super Mario Brothers based off of a text prompt.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:10.800
It's very rudimentary. You can't actually I don't think you can actually play the levels.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:18.240
It's just more of a graphical representation of them. But, you know, it's apparently the first

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:28.880
text to level model in existence. So it's neat. It's not sure what you can really do with this,

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:35.360
but it's a neat concept. I guess it's very basic. So like they have like some screenshots of like,

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.200
you know, many pipes, many enemies, little blocks, low elevation. And you kind of get

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:46.480
like a regular level, many pipes, many enemies. And it's all pipes. So not going to replace Mario

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.720
Maker anytime soon, but it's a neat idea. It's a neat concept.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.720
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see like, I mean, I guess we've had games in the past that kind of

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:02.400
like use a simple AI to develop levels on the fly like as you're playing them. But it's interesting

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.200
to see how that might get more complex for a more complex platform or like, you know, a little big

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:14.480
planet, little AI planet or whatever that just starts to generate levels. Although not that that

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:19.360
means it would be good necessarily, because sometimes AI levels, you can kind of tell

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.160
they're generated by robot, you know, so. Yeah, it's just a kind of a neat proof of

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.640
concept right now. Yeah. All right. Well, what was an amazing proof of concept when it came out was

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.840
the game Tetris Effect. And Tetris Effect has already been re-released as Tetris Effect

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.560
Connected. And now it's going to be basically getting another big update. They're not giving

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.280
it a new subtitle, but Tetris Effect Connected will be getting an update alongside the launch

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:52.400
of the game on PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation VR 2. It will have some new game modes, which are

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:59.360
classic score attack, which looks like the old 1989 Tetris Nintendo game, the official licensed

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:05.840
Nintendo game, not the Tengen one. And then there's a version called zone marathon, which is

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.840
the marathon mode, but with that zone mechanic, which was new to Tetris Effect where you can kind

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:15.440
of like freeze things for a little bit. That's all built. That's how you get the 24 line Tetris

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:20.480
or whatever, all that stuff that's in the zone stuff. There also is purify mode where you can

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.200
now do an endless mode and master mode, which also has an endless mode. So there's a whole little

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.480
video if you want to check out that. But yeah, you can pretty much get this game just about on

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.680
every game front, including on PC via steam and Epic game store. It's even on quest because it is

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:43.360
a VR game. It's it is even on Luna. So Tetris Effect is really everywhere.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.800
So now they just did you catch the Tetris movie trailer?

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:53.840
I did see the Tetris movie trailer and I was pleasantly surprised that it is not a game where

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.160
they like, Oh, let's turn Tetris into a movie. It is a movie about the release of the game Tetris

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:06.320
that wasn't in the original like, oh, Apple TV got the rights to do a Tetris movie or whatever it was

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.320
in the beginning. I think a lot of us were assuming they're going to do a movie based on

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:16.160
Tetris. That's silly. But now that we see from the trailer, oh, it's about the release of Tetris.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.840
And getting that, you know, you know, during that era, especially, you know, in the 80s, when that

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:28.880
game came over, getting a Russian game and okay, okay, I get it. It looks interesting. So yeah.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.520
Yeah, I saw that shared in our discord. I see some folks in our chat talking about that tire class

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.280
says that trailer was released. And it's not what you expect. Looks like a fun and entertaining

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.600
movie, given the circumstances that were involved to bring the game to the US. Yeah, I'm curious if

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.680
they might get into some of the because you can see that Nintendo is represented in there. I'm

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.400
curious if they'll get into some of the tengan Atari versus Nintendo stuff when it came to

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.440
Tetris. I don't know if that's a little too in the weeds for a movie plot, but it'll be interesting.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.640
Questbuster says that Tetris trailer was wild, as Joe and Matt says that movie does look

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.120
interesting. Yeah, so it'll be interesting. And I think streaming is a good place for that.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.040
I'm not sure as many people would have ran to the theater to see something like that. I mean,

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:18.320
I might have, but I think streaming is a really good place for a movie like that. I think it'll

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:23.920
actually catch more eyeballs there than it will with a traditional release. So good on Apple for

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:30.320
picking that up. All right, let's move on. Let's move on to a game that maybe more big game

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:39.040
developers should pick up. Dark Soccer, I think this one's yours. Yeah, Cocaine Bear. That's all

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:47.040
I need to say. A lot of people are talking about this one. I'm probably never going to see it

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.840
because it honestly sounds like the dumbest thing I've ever heard. That's exactly why we need to see

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.200
it. Every time I see the trailer, I'm like, if Loki had become a movie director, this is what

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.240
he would have made. There is enough stupid in my life that I don't need to be adding to it.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:09.600
I love stupid movies. IDGAF. The only way this can get better is if Cocaine Bear can join the

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:15.200
Fast and the Furious crew for Fast 11. So that's the only way this can get better. What if they

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:22.320
did Cocaine Bear versus Sharknado? I mean, I'm fine with the extended Cocaine Bear universe.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:28.000
What about Cocaine Bearnado? Well, the first movie has to succeed first, and then there will

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.760
absolutely be a sequel like Cocaine Bear 2 Electric Boogaloo. Absolutely a potential thing

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:43.360
if this movie makes a lot of money. Well, at any rate, they're going to be doing a tie-in web-based

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:51.280
game called Cocaine Bear 8-Bit Game. If you go to cocainebear.movie.game,

01:18:52.320 --> 01:19:00.480
then you can play a game as the Cocaine Bear. I think they have the subtitle Rise of the Escobar.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:09.680
Yeah, the play button on this thing is covering the title. But I'm going to look at the game.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:16.800
It's very loud. That's what I found. It's clearly built to play on a phone browser.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:27.920
Also, there's a link on here that I just followed, and apparently Elizabeth Banks has Cocaine Bear's

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:35.120
head in her office. I think she's the director. Yeah. Which is hilarious. Not the real Cocaine

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.720
Bear, but not like a taxidermied head. From the movie.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.200
Yeah, but I think that's funny. Tigerclaws says,

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:48.000
the movie is loosely based on the true story, but the movie takes huge liberties on the story.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.360
I would hope that they do. I hope so. S.G.O. and Hunter Matt

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.880
does confirm she is the director. She was a great Rita Repulsa for the record. I

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.920
actually enjoyed that Power Rangers reboot movie, and she did good in that role.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:12.960
By the way, slightly off topic, I watched this thing that I didn't even know was a thing where

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:19.120
they had Street Fighter versus Power Rangers, and it was a real Power Rangers thing.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:27.120
It had the actual actors in it and everything, and it was a trip to watch.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.960
Well, there's a new Power Rangers thing coming to Netflix that has the actual original...

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.160
They're in their fucking 50s now doing Power Rangers shit. Although, as we know,

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.360
the yellow one passed away in a car accident years ago. I think it's like her daughter or...

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.440
What's his face? Killed himself.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.400
Yeah, but he wasn't in the original original, if I remember right.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.360
Yeah, he was.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.160
Was he? I thought he didn't come out till the next season or something.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:52.960
Green Ranger.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:21:02.640
Oh, okay. Well, the movie was shot before he passed, so he could be in it in a cameo.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.480
He was in the thing that I watched, the Street Fighter thing,

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:12.880
so it was a very interesting watch. If I can find it again... This has Ray Liotta in it,

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.840
Cocaine Bear.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:21.840
Oh, it's got a lot of... This is the year people are just unleashing their pandemic

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.920
frustrations out on film.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.960
Hey, I'll go see it.

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:30.240
They need a test, baby, to tighten up the game design in level three,

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.560
because it froze after I beat it.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.120
All right, well, since Star... Oh, go ahead.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.240
But at any rate, yeah.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.680
Okay, since Star Saga brought up the versus Street Fighter thing, it's a nice little tie

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.040
into the next story, which has to do with that, right, Loki?

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.280
This is a fighting game I'd love to see, but instead we're getting a comic

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.560
or a limited comic series, which is just fine.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.480
It is... IDW Comics has announced a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles versus Street Fighter

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:08.240
comic crossover event. It's coming May of this year, and it's going to be penned by Paul Allor

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.280
with art by Ariel Mendel and colors by Sarah Meyers. It'll be a five-issue miniseries,

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.560
and it's going to have the turtles going toe-to-toe with Ryu, Ken, Chung-Li and Guile.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:22.800
Neat.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.840
I want a game now.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:28.240
I know, right? That's where I'm at, is I'm like on it with the Ninja Turtles have had

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.200
several fighting games. I mean, all from...

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.000
Or like DLC for Street Fighter 6 or something like that.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.280
Yeah, right? So why not? If they're not going to do another Tatsunoko versus Capcom or whatever,

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:45.280
why don't we get a TMNT versus Street Fighter? Why not? If we're not going to ever get Tekken

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:50.000
versus Street Fighter, well, we got one, we didn't get the other. We got Street Fighter

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.400
across Tekken, but we never got Tekken across Street Fighter. So why not give us Ninja Turtles?

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.280
Yeah.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:01.280
I'm here for it. All right, let's talk about a warning, a reminder warning.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.800
Oh, one thing. I would love for them to bring in the characters from

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.720
Tournament Fighter. Wouldn't that be cool?

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.760
I'm looking in chat for some comments too. DJ Roma S says,

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:20.240
I'm friends with Sarah Meyer. Her artwork is amazing. She does the ink work for TMNT

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.240
Saturday Morning Adventures. Oh, that's pretty cool. And of course, Tiger Claw,

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.040
I knew Tiger Claw would have something to say about this because I know he loves Ninja Turtles,

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:31.120
saying the TMNT in this comic crossover appears to be of the current continuity because we get

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:39.600
the fifth turtle, Jenica, on the cover. All right. Well, going over to some stories about Nintendo,

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.120
the Nintendo, what?

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:48.480
Sorry. I was going to say that is one of the best characters to be added into the TMNT continuity

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:53.680
because I was reading the comics pretty religiously for a while. Such a good character,

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.800
but I digress.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.920
No, no worries. No worries. All right. Everybody got their Ninja Turtles out of their system? All

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:04.240
right. Let me talk about Nintendo changes that they're reminding you of. They've talked about

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:10.800
this before, but reminder, as of March 2023, so coming up next month at the end of the month,

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:17.360
you will no longer be able to buy Nintendo eShop purchases for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. You cannot

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:23.120
download free content. That means no more game demos. Also, related services will cease to

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:28.560
function. So some things have already stopped happening. So last year, they yanked the credit

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:36.400
card to add funds. They yanked it on the Wii U or 3DS, and then you couldn't use an eShop card

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:42.640
anymore at that point. If you link your Nintendo Network ID wallet with your Nintendo account,

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.400
you can use the shared balance to purchase on any of these systems until March, but after that,

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:54.480
they will only work on the Nintendo Switch. Further clarification, which is needed here.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:03.520
The consolidation service, which allows you to merge your eShop balance between the Nintendo

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:10.480
account and the Switch eShop, doesn't work anymore after March 2024. So if you have any

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.240
money sitting on those systems, and now that I think about it, I wonder if I don't just have a

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.200
couple bucks floating in my wallet or whatever on one of these systems. I think I need to go check

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.360
just to make sure. I don't think so, but maybe on Wii U. I could see that maybe I had some points

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:31.760
left over or something there. But as of March 2024, you can't even combine the accounts

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.560
anymore. Why we had separate accounts for all this shit in the first place, I will never

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:43.520
understand. But I digress. After all, Microsoft and Sony have kept the same network ever since

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:52.800
the Xbox era. Xbox, 360, One. They've all used the same network, but I digress. Nintendo always

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.760
does things a little bit differently, don't they? But this is a good reminder. Check your Wii U

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:06.720
balances. Check all that stuff. Make sure they work. Mike Def says get that Pokemon bank and

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:12.400
transporter. If you ever want to pull your Pokemon off the DS, download that still while it's still

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:18.480
free before it doesn't work anymore. So great call out there for sure. Hopefully the bank will

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:22.240
continue to work even if the rest of Nintendo's online stuff doesn't. But I guess maybe because

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.120
that's all through the Pokemon company, they may operate that a little differently. So it'd be

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:34.080
interesting to see. All right. Well, let's go into our next segment to celebrate something

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:49.680
that hopefully will not be pulled in the year 2024. And now it's time to travel back to a

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:55.600
simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's

01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:02.720
time for the Classic Game of the Week. All right, in Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:11.600
I picked After Burner Climax. And I love the music in this game.

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.000
Let me play a little bit of it in the background so our podcast folks can hear

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.800
as well as the live folks here. It's freaking After Burner. But at any rate,

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:31.280
After Burner Climax is another game in the After Burner series. It was released in arcades in 2006

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:39.920
and then had releases for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in April 2010. And you remember when we would go

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:48.640
to was it Mike's incredibly mediocre pizza? John's incredibly shitty pizza.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.800
Yeah, that was it. Well, mediocre. There were some good ones.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.160
I'm going to step away from keyboard for a minute while you finish saying it.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:04.480
Well, at any rate, I would pretty much be lying toward this and Deadstorm Pirates.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:13.520
So I love After Burner Climax. And, you know, just like the earlier incarnations of After Burner,

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:24.960
the Deluxe After Burner Climax cabinet had a servo cook chair that you could also use a button to

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:33.200
keep it locked in the static position. And it would like completely move around as you played

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.400
if you didn't use that. There were other cabinet versions that had a commander version, which tilts

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.280
side to side and the standard version that doesn't move at all. The deluxe cabinet had

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:51.840
a widescreen LCD monitor while the standard and commander had a 29 inch CRT. The digital version

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:57.200
actually has been delisted from Xbox Live and PlayStation tour as of December 2014

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:02.960
and was removed from all the storefronts in May 2015. There is a mobile version that was

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:09.760
re-released via the Sega Forever service in April 2019, but that's also gone.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:18.960
At any rate, with After Burner Climax, it introduced two different aircraft,

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:28.720
the F-A-18E Super Hornet and the F-15E Strike Eagle. The original F-14 Tomcat that had been,

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:33.040
you know, the mainstay of the series was replaced with the F-14D Super Tomcat.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:40.000
All of these are real planes, by the way, so I think that was cool. I think that they modeled

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:48.720
them really nicely. It's just, you know, my problem with After Burner is because of the way that

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:56.000
you're playing moves never felt really realistic. But at the same time, this game is, it's a lot

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:01.120
different when you're actually playing it on one of the deluxe caps. Anyway, when you choose your

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:07.120
plane, you can use the throttle to choose between four different paint jobs on your planes. You have

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:15.840
a standard, a camo, a special and a low visibility scheme. After you choose that, you can also choose

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:23.600
to listen to the After Burner Climax music or the original soundtrack from After Burner 2 by

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:31.600
holding the throttle back and hitting the missile button. I mean, it's really very, I'm gonna say,

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.600
you know, that the game, you know, is very straightforward. You know, you pew pew things.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:42.400
It's got like a lock-in system on there. You can shoot your missiles. You've got a limited

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:52.720
number of your missiles, just like any, you know, fighter jet would. But it's so funny,

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:57.360
like the original After Burner, we had one at Scandia for a while. You remember?

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:05.920
I remember that. I do. I don't remember that, unfortunately. I used to get super motion sick

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:14.480
on it, but because it was the shifting circle kind of one. But the moving chair ones, I actually

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.600
never got so sick on. I used to play a lot of Starblade, remember? I only remember them having

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.640
the After Burner cabinet. It was either at Disneyland or at Great America. One of the

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.800
arcades had it. I think the Great America arcade that had that Galaxian 3 or whatever.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.320
The last time I went to Great America, they had a Planet Harriers.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:42.400
And you couldn't get me off of that machine. I was in love. But going back to After Burner Climax,

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:50.800
this was going on when there was this sort of renaissance for the classic SEGA titles.

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:58.160
So a little bit more behind this one. It was developed by SEGA AM2, you know, so it was the

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:11.840
big arcade group for SEGA. Art done by Aoki Seiji, programmed by Sumi Masayuki. It is

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:18.560
just a great game. I hate that all the home versions have been delisted.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:29.040
Also, as far as the system it was released on, it was on the SEGA Lindbergh system

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:38.240
that used a 3 gigahertz Pentium 4 CPU, 1 gigabyte of RAM, and an NVIDIA GPU,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.720
and an internal GPD ROM system. And this was the same one that Initial D arcade stage 4,

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:56.560
House of the Dead 4, Virtua Tennis 3, Virtua Fighter 5, and the cancelled Syfy.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.160
So their current one, House of the Dead Scarlet Dawn, is on, I think this last one was an Unreal

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:14.560
4 based one. But at any rate, I mean, it's just sort of fun going back and seeing what these ran

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:23.920
on and, you know, seeing where the technology has come from. Because the one that came after

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:33.840
that was the Europa R that SEGA Rally 3 played on. But at any rate, it's just kind of neat seeing

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:38.880
how the technology has gone. Because this game, even today I would think, this game looks pretty

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:43.360
fantastic. Yeah, it's still a great looking game, especially with how fast it moves, right?

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:50.400
Reminds me of an F-Zero, but in the sky. Well, and you know where else the climax name has been

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:58.720
used was in Bayonetta. When the After Burner theme was the climax version,

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.360
there was, wasn't there also the one thing where you could switch her from

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:13.920
After Burner to a different shooter? Like if you had some outfit equipped?

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.520
I don't remember. Somebody in chat might speak up. Yeah, but my favorite thing though is that when

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:25.920
she, there was, I think it was also like a Space Harrier one for her, but I love how she says,

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:33.440
welcome to my fantasy zone. Yeah, yeah, it was Star Fox. That was the first switch.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.400
If you had like the Fox McCloud outfit equipped, that when you played through that scene you'd

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:49.440
play as an Arwing. I didn't know that. It's neat. Yeah. But at any rate, it's a great game.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:57.920
I still love to this day playing it in the arcade. So yeah, you know what I wish that they would have

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.400
done with me? I've done a fantasy zone climax. Well, it's never too late, right? There was the

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.920
SEGA ages re-releases, but I mean, heck I would, I'd have that in a heartbeat.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.000
All right, there it is. SEGA, bring us Planet Harriers at home, the end.com.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:23.200
Your classic of the week, After Burner Climax. Great arcade game that was very impressive and

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:28.400
yeah, really does still kind of hold up today. Bonds 006 says, this is the game that is the

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:34.480
reason I play Ace Combat. So, you know, people get started on the genre in one place and end up

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:40.080
playing other stuff. So awesome, awesome. All right, not everyone can be perfect. All right,

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.880
let's move on and travel around the world quickly with some rapid fire news and then we'll do some

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:50.160
release dates as well. But let's do rapid fire news first, Loki. Speaking of Ace Combat, if you

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.920
want to play that and you're a premium or extra subscriber of PlayStation Plus, you're going to

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.720
extra subscriber of PlayStation Plus, you can do that as part of their game catalog in February.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:10.080
They're actually offering Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown for PlayStation 4. On PlayStation 5 and

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.960
PlayStation 4, Borderlands 3 is coming as well. One of my favorites, Earth Defense Force 5 for

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:22.160
PlayStation 4, The Forgotten City on PlayStation 5 and 4, Horizon Forbidden West on 5 and 4,

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:32.720
I Am Setsuna on PlayStation 4, Lost Sphear, Oninaki both on PlayStation 4, Outriders on PS4 and PS5,

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:40.160
The Quarry on both, Resident Evil 7 Biohazard on PlayStation 4, Scarlet Nexus on 5 and 4,

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:46.720
and Tekken 7 on 4. And then of the classic catalog, they're giving you Harvest Moon

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:52.080
Back to Nature, Legend of Dragoon and Wild Arms 2 on the original PlayStation.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.920
I'm sorry, did someone say Legend of Dragoon?

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:55.840
Yes.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.200
That is an attention grabber.

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.200
And then also PlayStation 4, Destroy All Humans. I'm assuming this is the remake

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:10.000
that is part of the classic catalog there. And then this is a surprising bit of news,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.520
considering all of the delay news we hear, especially around Dead Island 2,

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.880
but Dead Island 2 has gone gold. And in fact, they have moved up their release date one week

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.000
to April 21st, 2023. So.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.920
Cool, it's coming. It'll be here soon. No more delays.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.560
Only like 10 years after the first game, but all right. I hope it's good.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.240
Better late than never, I guess.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.920
Yeah, hope it's good. Hope it's worth the wait.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.080
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:47.680
Oh, my artistic hero, the man himself, Amano Yoshitaka.

01:37:50.080 --> 01:38:00.560
He is doing the cover for the DLC soundtracks that are coming with the first-run copies of

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:06.560
Cuphead's Japanese physical edition. I was looking at the price. It's like 40 bucks,

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.120
which isn't bad, but then the shipping is also 40 bucks, which is bad.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.920
And I want this so much. Oh, the artwork looks so good,

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:25.440
but it's playing homage to the classic fantasy RPGs. It's absolutely beautiful artwork.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:32.480
There's been samples of it posted on the Twitters, but I love him.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:36.480
Yeah, it's really cute. For those that are watching on Twitch,

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.440
we're trying to put some of that up on stream so you can kind of see what we're talking about.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:45.200
It is very impressive, obviously. Yeah, but I mean, keep in mind that

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:53.680
it is because of this man that we have Power Rangers. Well, okay. He did the designs for

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.040
Science Ninja Team Gatchaman when he was doing work for Tatunoko. He did the character designs

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:07.920
for my favorite anime in the universe. And it was from that series that the idea for doing

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:15.600
live-action Sentai came out. So we indirectly have him to thank for Power Rangers. But I mean,

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:25.760
he also did an illustration for Vampire Hunter D novels and worked on Demon City Shinjuku. I mean,

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:35.200
this guy and his other artwork is absolutely astounding. I have an art book this thick of

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:43.520
his work. And I need every little single piece of his artwork I can get my grubby little fingers on.

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.120
All right. Well, of course, obviously Amano is also very much known for his work with the

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.120
Final Fantasy series. And we've been getting a lot of interesting Final Fantasy tidbits this year,

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:58.000
not just with game releases like Theatrhythm and, you know, the upcoming Final Fantasy

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.120
Pixel Remaster release on consoles. But we know that Final Fantasy 7 also supposedly getting the

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:10.080
second chapter in the Rebirth series, or excuse me, the second chapter of the remake series

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.640
Rebirth is also supposed to be this year. Square Enix has been sharing some insight to Final

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.200
Fantasy 7's development, kind of talking a little bit about, you know, what maybe some of the

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:23.840
original plans were for the game. I feel like we knew this, like this had been said in an interview

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:29.040
before, but the development team did share that the original plan for Final Fantasy 7 was that

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.800
the game was going to take place in New York City. I thought I remember something about some of that

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.320
spinning off into what eventually became Parasite Eve, but I digress. So the game was originally

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.640
going to take place in New York City. The story was a little bit different, but there were some

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.600
elements that were the same. In the original story, Detective Joe, whoever that is, not Cloud,

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.600
but Detective Joe was going to be investigating the group that was looking to destroy the Mako

01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:01.440
reactors. So that whole part, you know, with the Mako reactors and, you know, people wanting to

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.960
blow it up for their reasons to save the planet, probably, like it was in the Final Fantasy 7 game,

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.480
probably tied into the original 7. So interesting. One of the members in the group went through some

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:19.520
different changes. That character eventually became Cloud Strife. So who knows? I mean,

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:24.880
I don't know if Parasite Eve took more of that original idea. I don't know. I think maybe just

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.440
maybe some of the graphics for New York, who knows? But it's kind of interesting that that's

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.640
where Final Fantasy 7 started. And so if you were seeing parallels between Midgar and a big

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:42.480
metropolis like New York City, you're not wrong. There's also that. So all right, let's check out

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:47.120
some games that are coming out this week. I don't think we have the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but we

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:50.400
have some other games that maybe you can look forward to this week. Loki.

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:57.040
Yes, like Atomic Heart, which is going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:06.240
Xbox Series. Like a Dragon, Isshin on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.640
Seven Doors, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:20.640
Digimon World Next Order on PC and Nintendo Switch. Then it looks like we're getting into

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:27.520
the PlayStation VR stuff. We have Horizon Call of the Mountain on PlayStation 5 or PlayStation VR 2

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:37.920
actually. Kazuni AI, Touch of the Beat on PlayStation 5. Redemption Reapers on PC, Nintendo

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:46.320
Switch and PlayStation 4. Blood Bowl 3 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:54.240
Series. Company of Heroes 3 on PC. Grimm Guardians, Demon Purge on PC, Nintendo Switch,

01:42:54.240 --> 01:43:00.880
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. And then we have Raiden 3 Cross,

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:09.520
Mikado Maniacs on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.120
Cliven Wrench That came close to importing that one.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.320
Matt

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.000
What's Mikado Maniacs?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.120
Danielle Mikado is a music studio.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.040
Matt Hmm, that'd be cool.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.440
Danielle And it's supposed to have a pretty killer soundtrack. I mean,

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.720
Raiden 3 was pretty mediocre as far as the Raiden games go.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.160
But the Mikado studio has done some amazing music.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.680
Matt Cliven Wrench on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:49.240
and we've got a couple more here. Kirby's Return to Dreamland deluxe on Nintendo Switch and last

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:56.960
but not least Octopath Traveler 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. That's it.

01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.760
All right, let's travel over to Japan. I feel like we've had some light release weeks in Japan

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:06.080
lately. This week, very much not the case. We have a lot of shit coming out in Japan this week. So,

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.000
pull up a chair. Here we go on the Nintendo Switch. Oita Beppu Mystery Guide, the Warped Bamboo

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.640
Lantern is out on the switch this week. The Ultimate Wonder Boy Collection. I was looking at

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:20.560
this because I was wondering if it was just another rerelease of the Dragon's Trap and it is,

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.760
but there's it has Wonder Boy, Wonder Boy Monster Land, Dragon's Trap, Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair,

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:31.840
Wonder Boy 5, Wonder Boy 4, or excuse me, Monster World 4 is in there too. It's very, very busy with

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:38.160
Wonder Boy games. So if you are a fan of that series, there's that for you. Digimon World Next

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:45.200
Order has its release, the international edition in Japan this week as well. Akatsuki Yureyu Koi

01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:50.400
Akari is out in a regular and limited edition this week. Sakura Moyu as the Knight's

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.920
Reincarnation is out in a regular and limited edition this week as well on the switch. Koi

01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:03.560
Suro Kanojo Nu No Bukkyo Na Butai is out in a regular and limited edition this week in Japan.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:13.080
Yep. Omoide Kakaete Ai No Koi is out this week as well in a regular and

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:13.840
I'm like a dating sim.

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.120
And audience, limited edition. Yes, it is.

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.520
I'm gonna keep guessing.

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:26.080
Okay, let's see. Other games we have the Crimson Flower That Divides Us Lunar Coupling is out in

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:37.120
Japan on the 23rd. That same Raiden 3 Cross Mikado Maniacs is out. Hakuoki Remeroku is out as well

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:44.240
this week in Japan. And of course, Octopath Traveler 2 does get a Japanese release. And of

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.320
course that Kirby game also getting released in Japan as well. And if you were waiting for this

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:54.200
on the switch in Japan, guess what? You can finally play Ark Survival Evolved in a physical

01:45:54.200 --> 01:46:02.560
edition on this switch this week in Japan. How about the PlayStation 5 now? The PlayStation VR 2

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:06.480
is released this week. That is worth noting. So if you want to pick that up, and then that would

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.440
mean a lot of the stuff that comes with it, including the Horizon Call the Mountain, the

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:16.200
charging station. That same Raiden 3 crossover game is also out on the PlayStation 5 if you'd

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:21.880
rather play it there. Tortuga A Pirate's Tale also out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.

01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:28.680
Octopath Traveler 2 also out on the PlayStation 5. What did I tell you? A busy week. How about the UK?

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:39.680
Well, on the 21st, we have Like a Dragon Isshin. That's for PlayStation and Xbox. Likewise, we have

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:49.480
Atomic Heart. On the 22nd for Switch, we have Digimon World Next Order. On the 23rd, for the

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:58.160
big three consoles, we have Blood Bowl 3 Brutal Edition. For PC, Company of Heroes 3 for PlayStation

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:06.520
and Switch, My Life Pet Vet. Moving on to the 24th, we have Do Not Open for PlayStation for

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:15.880
Switch, SpongeBob SquarePants Crusty Cook-Off. That sounds completely horrifying. On PlayStation, we

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:23.960
have Broken Pieces, PlayStation Xbox, Hunt Showdown, Limited Bounty Hunter Edition. For Switch

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:33.000
and PlayStation, Octopath Traveler 2. For Switch, Kirby Return to Dreamland Deluxe. On the 24th also

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.560
for PlayStation and Switch, Crazy Chicken Traps and Treasures. For the big three, we have Clive

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:47.320
and Wrench, and that's it for the week. All right, we have a few more stories, then we're going to get

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:52.600
to the listener roundtable. We do have an email tonight, finally bucking the trend of the past,

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:58.920
what, two months. So that's exciting. Spirit Gasp here. So we'll also get to your comments and maybe

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:04.760
your phone calls if we have time as well over on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:08.600
But first, we have a few more stories for you. Let's go back to Loki.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:15.960
So we talked last week how there's going to be this big update for Team Fortress 2. Well,

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:21.400
apparently they've started to walk back the expectations for that. So they've changed

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:28.360
a little bit of the passage that was in their update. So it previously read, you know, the last

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:34.760
few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates, but this year we're playing a full

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:41.240
on update size update with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and who knows what

01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:48.600
else, which means we need Steam Workshop content, your Steam Workshop content. And now it says,

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.520
you know, the last Team Fortress summer updates have only been item updates, but this year we're

01:48:52.520 --> 01:49:00.360
playing a full on holiday sized update. I don't know what that means as far as different. With

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:05.480
items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and other community contributed fixes for the

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:12.760
game, which means we need your Steam Workshop content, your Steam Workshop content, which

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:19.960
I mean, originally it sounded like that, you know, they were incorporating Steam Workshop stuff into

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:24.120
the game update, but now it's like, no, it's only going to be Steam Workshop content.

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.080
We were just gathering and putting it out as a free update, even though you've made all the

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:39.960
stuff for it. Oh, well. It's a really old game. Like, I don't expect them to be publishing more

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.520
stuff for it. We could just make a Team Fortress 3 if y'all weren't allergic to the number three.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.440
I can't do that.

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.480
Snow three evolve.

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.640
Speaking of allergies, I am definitely allergic to this trend in the gaming community, DarkSakura.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:03.640
Squenix is not learning anything. They're not listening to people and they're not learning.

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:10.280
They announced very recently that they are launching their NFT based game,

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:20.200
Symbiogenesis, Symbiogenesis on a site called Polygon, which is an Ethereum scaling network.

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:27.000
It was announced last November. And then, and back then they said that story driven collectibles

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:34.280
were of course at the heart of it and that they plan to launch on Ethereum. But now they say

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:40.680
they're using Polygon instead that uses a side chain to basically deal in faster and cheaper

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:47.160
transactions than the Ethereum's network, well, their own main net can handle. They

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:56.040
were also interested in the lower fees in general, going back to make it a little bit cheaper.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:03.560
And they wanted to offer what they call a unique experience to Web3

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:09.000
fans. This is stated by the game producer Tamate Nalyuki.

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:18.440
They put some more details out. It's going to be built around 10,000 character NFTs that are tied

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:23.960
to game mechanics. Although there are other entities used in the game, according to their

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:29.080
document that they released to Polygon Labs, owning a character NFT is not required to play

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:36.440
the game, although it adds unspecified extra value to the experience. Character NFT holders

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:42.520
can create replica NFTs to share story information with other characters. The game will be taking

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:50.200
a place on a floating continent above a polluted future earth with a society forced to band

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:58.920
together to keep a dragon away from their floating home. It is turn-based gameplay tied to the

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:07.800
storyline. Different paths go with different missions and either holding or trading NFTs.

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:13.400
They showed some of the NFT items that included dragon tarot cards and the monster storybook.

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:20.520
There's no more actual details out. But I can tell you, I'm...

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:32.040
No. And they've been investing in this Ethereum sandbox and they also announced that they were

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:38.920
going to revive Dungeon Siege, the franchise. That better not be coming out as an NFT thing.

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.480
Dungeon Siege wasn't bad, but if it's all going to be NFT crap, then forget it.

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:47.880
Wasn't their last version of the Dungeon Siege game that they did was Awful 2?

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.600
Dungeon Siege 3? I didn't think it was that bad.

01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:55.560
No, I'm thinking of a different game. I'm thinking of Dungeon Keeper.

01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:00.760
Oh, yeah. So here's the question I have about this game. Let's take a look at another Square

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:05.160
Enix title real quick. I want to know, does the NFT game, what's it called? Symbiogenesis?

01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.120
Does Symbiogenesis last...

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.000
Be a genus.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:16.920
Sorry. Whatever it's called. Does it last longer or shorter than Babylon's Fall?

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:21.960
For the record, which by the way, this is a timely question because in case you forgot,

01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:30.600
Babylon's Fall was released on March 3rd, 2022. The servers are being shut down on Thursday,

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:38.120
February 23rd. So this is actually timely. R.I.P. Babylon's Fall. Literal P. Rest in it.

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:49.800
So Babylon's Fall lasted 51 weeks. Does Symbiogenesis go,

01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:55.480
we're going to play Price is Right, higher than or lower than 51 weeks?

01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:57.320
Lower.

01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:05.320
Well, there's another thing, too, that people need to keep in mind. So in last May's,

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:12.600
Gwenix sold off a bunch of their studios and franchises, including Tomb Raider. And they used

01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:21.480
the roughly 300 million that they got to start supporting this Web3 experience as far, and also

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:29.320
some other business ventures. So if this flops the way we think it will, Gwenix is going to be

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:32.920
not just in P, they're going to be in deep shit.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:37.480
This is why I made the prediction I did at the beginning of the year that the current CEO of

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:44.040
Square Enix is not going to make it through the year as CEO. And this is another fantastic

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:49.080
example because when this game is an embarrassment and ends up lasting less than 51 weeks, which is

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:58.200
where I'm going to hedge my bet, it's over. Questbuster in chat says, Rob not pulling any

01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:02.600
punches. You know what? I don't have time for NFTs and neither does anyone else.

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:03.960
We're too old for this shit.

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:08.520
Yeah, exactly. I'm too old for this shit. And yeah, that's money that could have gone

01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:14.280
towards the development of putting more theater rhythm songs into theater the final bar line.

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.120
Bro, don't even.

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:17.720
All right.

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:23.720
Oh my God. They could have used that money to license Angela Aki. I'm just saying.

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:29.400
You know what's not in theater the final bar line? Babylon's fall.

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.600
My butt.

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.640
All right. Loki, what do you have for us?

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:45.240
Yes, it's another person being fired for sexual misconduct allegations. So Genshin Impact voice

01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:55.480
actor Elliot Gindi is no longer going to be voicing, I guess, Tignari because apparently,

01:55:55.480 --> 01:56:00.360
you know, they said after communications with voice recording agency, we hereby confirm that

01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:06.760
Elliot Gindi and the English voice actor for Tignari will no longer be voicing the character

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:12.680
in subsequent versions due to breach of contract. I guess that contract is, you know, sexual

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:18.840
allegations. Yeah, President, we are communicating with the voice recording agency regarding the

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:25.720
matter and casting a rerecording will gradually replace a Tignari's existing in game voice lines

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:30.360
and issue these updates in a corresponding announcement. Thank you for your support.

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:32.040
So he's being removed, removed.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.800
Yeah, there's that one. I remember the other game was that they were doing that with too.

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.960
They recast and redid all the voice lines.

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:47.000
Destiny 2. Remember, the guy from Game of Thrones used to be the little AI thing.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.960
And they know it wasn't the same reason, but they did do that.

01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:58.600
No, there was another one that was actually for this type of thing. I think. I want to say it was

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:06.360
in like a dragon, but I don't remember. I don't remember or one of the Yakuza games. I don't

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:12.760
remember now. I don't remember. I remember. Yeah, it's annoying to still see, you know,

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.560
this type of thing happening in the industry, but they're addressing it.

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:22.120
Quest Buster does point out miHoYo did the same thing with another character in 2021. This might

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.520
be why this sounds familiar, but it was when a Chinese voice actor was erased for similar

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:33.800
behavior while he was married, by the way. So, Dr. Sia says judgment the Yakuza spinoff game.

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.480
That's what it was.

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.000
Yeah. Yeah. Now that I think about it, I do remember a story about that, too,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.640
had something like that. That's right. It sure did. The actor got busted for drugs,

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.120
so they had to replace him because that's what it was. It's a huge, huge issue in

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:56.920
certain countries. So, yeah. Interesting. All right. And then DGRMS about this particular

01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:01.560
article says this guy is from my neck of the woods. Fuck that guy. The whole Elliott

01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:08.920
Gindi drama goes very deep. That's all I will say. All right. Well, another chat that was said

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:13.880
earlier in chat was SG100Matt saying it all comes back to Theatrhythm. And it sure does,

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:20.600
because guess what I have for the last story tonight? Theatrhythm rumors, but with substance

01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:27.080
to it, because it's a quote that was said. There's some press interviews going on with

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:33.240
producer Ichiro Hazama and director Masanobu Suzui, who are promoting Theatrhythm in the

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:37.880
various gaming press right now. But they are taking questions about what could be in the

01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:44.760
future for the series. And the team has actually said they'd love to work with franchises like

01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:51.880
Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem, and Pokemon. The developers would like to work with

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:56.280
Nintendo on the installment, and there's certainly the music there to do it. I mean, all they would

01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:00.600
have to do is like a Theatrhythm Super Smash Brothers, because I think about like how Super

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:05.720
Smash Brothers has the players in it that the audio players that have a very rich Nintendo

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:13.000
soundtrack in them. So to this entire story, I really just say please. What I thought was

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.880
interesting is that in a comment to this story on Go Nintendo, I thought this was an interesting

01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:24.200
take on it a comment I hear I don't usually read the comments. But here is like the one time in

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:30.040
internet history where I found the comment interesting. And the user said, as neat as the

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:36.600
Square Nintendo crossover rhythm game can be, Nintendo can just revive elite beat agents,

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:41.240
or make a spin off of EBA that focuses on Nintendo music only. Like you can play along to

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:44.760
a Mario theme and in the background, there could be a mini story of Mario rescuing Peach from

01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:49.560
browser again, and etc. So basically, this commenter is saying, you know, Nintendo could

01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:53.240
just kind of take the idea and make it their own because it wasn't that dissimilar in the first

01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:57.240
place from what elite beat agents was. I thought that was an interesting take on it.

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.520
They can have the art style be like Paper Mario.

02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:05.480
Yeah. Mike Defton chat says, give me pokey rhythm, please. You know what's interesting?

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:13.560
If I recall right, was it I don't think it was the Pokemon company, but it was maybe it was the

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:19.640
Pokemon company. There was that game Harmonite that was made by the people that make Pokemon.

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:25.320
It was very different type of game. But that was on the 3DS. It hadn't I mean, it was removed from

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:28.520
Pokemon. I didn't actually have the music in it or anything. But it was like a music game. It's just

02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:32.920
something that comes to mind when you kind of bring up the pokey rhythm. So is that Harmonite

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:40.040
was the thing. So d'Artussia says I definitely do the Zelda course first. Yeah. And, you know,

02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:45.160
Crypt of the NecroDancer is the thing. So it's not like Nintendo is closed off to letting other

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:52.280
companies have their IPs in interesting ways. So that could be very interesting. Jason says,

02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:57.640
Thea Trithym is the intro read and the last story lol. The way it ought to be tbh. Oh,

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:02.520
and Deft confirms Harmonite did have Pokemon music in it. Oh, I stand corrected. Perfect.

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:09.800
All right. Let's get to the listener roundtable. We invite your participation every week via chat.

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.520
If you have a question for us in chat, via Discord, which you can join our Discord over

02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:20.920
at vog at network.com slash discord, and our email bag so you can go to participate at orange

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:27.480
laundry do calm if you want to send us an email, which someone finally did this week. Let's get to

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:34.040
the email because it's gonna be an interesting one. It's a doozy. It's a doozy. So let's get

02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:41.320
this is a topic. Well, I'll, I'll say my thoughts once Jamie's read it. And I'm permitting this one

02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:47.880
because of the nature of the discussion that it will provoke. So hello, or after witnessing some

02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:54.920
fallout yesterday from a Final Fantasy 14 streamer trying out Hogwarts legacy. I wanted to ask you

02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.160
all how you feel about the situation where anyone who streams the game gets a swarm of people

02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:05.800
harassing them over it. First off, I 100% support those who refuse to purchase the game or watch any

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:11.400
content from it. She who will not be named is a scummy individual to put it lightly.

02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:17.320
Now it seems that anyone who has any Harry Potter fondness or plays this game is immediately labeled

02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:23.400
as hateful, a bigot or transphobic. I grew up reading slash watching Harry Potter, and have

02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:29.640
been curious about the game haven't bought it. But as someone who was the victim of harassment

02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:35.240
to the point of where I almost made an irreversible decision, it's really hard for me

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:41.320
to stand by and say that this retaliation is okay. trans people from around the world have had to

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:49.000
endure harassment their entire lives. I understand that. But this isn't but but this isn't right to

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:55.160
fight hate with hate and risk what that we lose others. I know Jamie said that she didn't want

02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:00.600
to cover anything Hogwarts legacy related on the show. So if you choose to bypass this email,

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:06.120
I understand. I just wanted to express my concerns in the only way I can and that Twitter

02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:13.400
sure as shit isn't going to allow. Love you guys. Garth Wolf. Yeah, um,

02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:18.040
I've thought long and hard about this one. Um,

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:28.760
because I only have one friend, one person that I have retained followship of, who was playing this

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:38.760
game. And the biggest thing that I see is that, well, first of all, I've been seeing a lot of just

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:51.320
really terrible. I would say conservative people using this game to express their anti trans

02:03:51.320 --> 02:04:00.120
sentiment. I am including that particular voice actor, who, while I love his voice,

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:07.160
and I love a certain character that he voiced, he is a piece of shit human. And he is friends

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:18.280
with the other piece of shit human. I loved the franchise. It came out at a really difficult time

02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:25.480
in my life. I actually still have my books. I'm sorry, I imported my books. And I spent a lot of

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:32.360
money on them. And I'm not one to throw away literature or anything really if I spent money

02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:36.840
on it because the money was already spent before I knew anything. That being said,

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:45.400
I am not buying the game. I haven't bought any, the very last thing I ever bought was a Slytherin

02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:53.960
mug, like years ago. And that's the last time I've bought anything. But it doesn't mean that I don't

02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:59.240
love the stories that we're told. I don't love the characters. I mean, I'm gonna say it. She's

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.240
a great author. She wrote really good stuff. And, and there are lots of parallels that people have

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:11.400
seen, that links back to their own experience as a marginalized or misunderstood person.

02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:19.800
You know, but then when you go and you see the motivation that this person has, and how

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:27.240
a lot of this has been sneaking into her later work on top of it, it just, it's completely

02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:33.800
soured it for me. It doesn't mean that I don't, you know, love and identify with the stories and

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:40.680
characters, but it also means that there's a part of it that's been very tarnished for me.

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:47.160
And the only way that, you know, a person in my position can really do something about it is to,

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:54.600
number one, speak out. Number two, vote with my dollars. I still won't go to Universal.

02:05:55.240 --> 02:06:00.920
I won't go to the Nintendo thing at Universal because it's contributing money back to her

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:07.000
franchise because I'm sure as we know that when you pay for franchising, you're, you're paying

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.560
like a flat rate to maintain that license. I didn't mean franchising, I meant licensing.

02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:18.200
So it's not like I think she's getting like active royalties every time a ticket is sold.

02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:25.560
I think she's already been paid and she's going to get paid again. So going back to this,

02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:35.320
as far as the harassment side of everything goes, there's a fair point that Garth made that our

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:41.960
trans friends have been living with this sort of hateful discrimination their entire lives. And

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:50.680
I'm even throwing in the internalized transphobia that society has inflicted upon them and taught

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:57.560
them that how they feel is wrong, that you're just confused or, you know, and anything for anyone on

02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:07.560
the queer spectrum, you know. I've had it as an ace person. I know we've all experienced this

02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:16.840
sense about ourselves when something doesn't conform to the default of, you know, what our

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:30.760
current society has inflicted upon us. But as far as going in to someone else's chat room

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:39.000
while they're streaming the game and being nasty and being abusive,

02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:45.800
I have learned, if anything, this is just going to make somebody double down more

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:49.800
and it's going to close them off from a willingness to be educated about it.

02:07:50.120 --> 02:08:04.760
I prefer that, especially if it's a friend of mine, you know, like this particular friend,

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:11.720
I happened to be in DBD chat when the discussion came up and I flat out said,

02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:18.600
I love you. I will not watch when you play this game. I will not give any revenue,

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:25.640
any, you know, I have Twitch turbos besides appointments. I wouldn't, you know,

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:32.280
watch any ads during that time. I would not participate in the stream. I would actively

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:38.840
not participate. And she's like, I get it. And she's like, I get why people

02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:46.920
are acting this way while people, you know, feel this about the game. I don't know that

02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:56.680
this person 100% understands that point of view. And I've tried to be as gently

02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:04.680
educational about it as I can, but I also feel that in this, the way things are, and this is

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:13.960
not just dealing with our trans friends or LGBTQ plus issues or, or, you know, even issues of,

02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:20.440
of race, you know, people of color having to explain why something is considered racist

02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:26.200
or something like that, that you also have to have a willingness to go out and be educated.

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:34.440
You know, you can't put the burden of education on somebody who is in that group.

02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:39.320
You know, you shouldn't make them do the emotional labor

02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:47.160
of having to be the one to educate you. I guarantee you, if you talk to any person of

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:54.680
color in this universe, they're going to tell you it's exhausting having to explain and defend

02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:03.480
themselves, their existence because of other people's willful ignorance, and that they want

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.360
them to explain it to them rather than this person giving enough of a shit to go out and

02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:14.360
look for the answer themselves. And that's how I feel about people streaming the game who claim

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:21.480
to be an ally and still don't understand when you explain it to them. It's, it's,

02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:34.760
you know what I mean? I'm just letting you have your space. I'm really trying to be succinct

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:40.360
about it. I do not think we should go in and harass other people TLDR, you know, yeah.

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:48.600
I think that you can take your friend aside, and you can explain to them and you can give

02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:55.560
them resources and let them educate themselves. And pay attention to the things that they say

02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:03.720
about it. Are they repeating what other people have said? Do they have their own reasons for it?

02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:15.240
Um, are they doing it from a place of hate? You know, I even look at this for a lot of people

02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:23.640
who claim allyship but are still playing the game that it's, it's like one of those as they

02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:29.640
quote micro transgressions, that they don't realize the harm that they're doing, and they're not

02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:38.280
doing it in a spirit of ill will, but they do not understand. And in some cases, there's people who

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:43.560
are not capable of understanding that experience. They don't live it. I tried to, I tell my mother

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:49.160
regularly, you know, like when I was talking about like, I forgot what I was talking about,

02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:52.280
but my mom said, well, I've never had that happen. I was like, you are not other people,

02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:55.240
just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it hasn't happened to other people.

02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:03.560
Your experiences are yours. Their experiences are theirs. And I think that you have to

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:11.800
be willing to be vulnerable. You have to really be willing to be vulnerable and be willing to be

02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:21.160
wrong in something that you hold as an intrinsic core belief. You have to be willing to be hurt

02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:30.520
by it, to grow as a person, to be educated and learn why what you're doing has a greater impact

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:36.760
than just having fun with a video game. Cause I can guarantee you a few of my, my trans friends

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:43.000
that I've spoken to on this one have lost friendships over this game because, and I will

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:51.320
paraphrase, my friend is saying your friendship with me to you is not more important than this

02:12:51.320 --> 02:13:00.600
game. This game is more important to you than I am as a person. So that's my piece for now.

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.320
I'm going to eat some pizza. No, you're fine. I'm going to be honest. When I originally saw

02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:08.120
the email, I didn't want to talk about it because I feel like I don't want to give that game any

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.480
more attention. This game has already gotten way too much attention. This boycott has absolutely

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:19.800
positively completely backfired. And if you don't like me for saying that too fucking bad. The proof

02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:26.760
is in the numbers. It's selling like wild. It's the number one watched game on Twitch. And I would

02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:33.400
say the boycott has only fanned the flames of that whole thing. Let me be clear. My own viewpoint on

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:38.600
Hogwarts legacy. I'm treating it like a sports game. I don't like there, there can be a great

02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:43.160
video game out there. I don't fucking care to play it. And I don't fucking care to play it because of

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.560
the shit that's come out of her mouth. And I've been disconnected from this universe for quite

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:53.560
some time. I think I've seen a couple of the movies, but like, that's it on the, so, so yeah,

02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:58.920
I understand why, why people are upset and why, you know, this game and so forth. That being said,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:04.040
I also understand that hurt people hurt people. And I understand why some of this is getting very

02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:09.000
ugly because like it was said in the, in the email, trans people have had to put up with a

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.160
lot of bullshit over the years. And so, yeah, when feelings get hurt, sometimes that turns around

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:21.960
into hurting other people. But that being said, and I think Jamie really already touched on a lot

02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:26.200
of this. I'm really just echoing a lot of what you just said. You don't know somebody else's

02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:33.560
backstory. You don't know what they might be capable of when it comes to separating

02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:41.320
Harry Potter as a fictional universe from the creator. What I mean by that is when you go in,

02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.480
and I'm not, I'm saying you, but I'm just saying not, not you the listener, but you the bully out

02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:49.480
there that probably isn't listening. When the bully goes into somebody's chat deciding, I'm

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:55.400
going to bully this person for playing this game. Have you ever thought that maybe the person that's

02:14:55.400 --> 02:15:01.800
playing the game is playing the game because Harry Potter was something that they read to

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:09.720
when they were trying to escape an abusive family situation. When mom and dad were fighting in the

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:17.240
other room, and there were physical exchanges happening. And somebody went in to lock themselves

02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:22.280
in their bedroom and read Harry Potter because that was their escape. You don't know if that's

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:32.760
somebody else's story. And so the answer is to bully that individual into coming over to your

02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:38.840
side. I'm sorry, that's absolutely not going to work. You're going to cause them to double down

02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:43.240
and dig their heels in and you're going to make the problem worse, which is what has happened in

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:50.200
this case. And the saying holds true, you catch more more flies with with honey than vinegar.

02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:54.440
Yeah, and but I'm sick of, you know, the unfortunately, when I see these perspectives

02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:59.400
presented about we should educate and we should do these different things that is usually met with,

02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:03.560
well, you're privileged, and you're in a privileged position to be able to do that.

02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.520
But you can also both things can be true. I could recognize, yes, I'm in a privileged position,

02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:13.400
but I can also recognize but guess what, this tactic you're using over here isn't working,

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:19.800
and you're going to be able to win more people to your side if you educate people. And that is what

02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:23.880
I do. When people say they're going to stream Hogwarts Legacy, I say great, I'm not going to

02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.280
be watching. I have no interest in that game. That woman turned me off to that game several

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:34.840
years ago and that entire universe. I have no interest in that franchise. There are 20 other

02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:40.120
games that came out this month that we ought to be talking about. And we're still talking about this.

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:46.040
And the other thing too, you know, we were bringing up privilege and I was bringing up

02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:55.720
putting the emotional labor on the, quote, afflicted party. We who were in a privileged

02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:05.960
position to be an ally, who have, you know, at least this semblance of fitting into some

02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:13.320
accepted stereotype, we can use our privilege and it's encouraged, I think, for us to do so to

02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:22.600
offer that point more in the way of pointing to resources put out by people in the marginalized

02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:30.600
groups. For example, and even me as an autistic person, I have submitted many things to my

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:35.800
corporate work that's actually had our training changed. Like for an example, they were all like

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:41.800
doing that person first, so person with autism, when the majority of us don't go by that. We go

02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:48.360
by autistic person and find the other thing insulting. And now the material says, ask what

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:58.200
someone prefers. But I think that also, as I am not a psychologist, I mean, I have a lot of

02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:04.600
interest in psychology and I've learned quite a bit about it, but I'm not a psychologist and I

02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:10.760
can't tell you that this is the true effect of someone's mindset or their neurology or whatnot.

02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:17.800
Just like, I mean, I spent a lot of time in the sociology courses, but I'm not a sociologist. I

02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:24.680
don't know how it affects society in this point, for example. You have to know resources that you

02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:31.320
can direct people to because you cannot expect the person in the group to continue to provide

02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:38.600
that emotional labor and consistent, I would even say, reopening of wounds by having to speak about

02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:46.760
it ad nauseam. It's up to us to be a good ally for the groups, the marginalized groups that we

02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:54.040
do, are not an active part of and provide the material that has been approved, that has been

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:59.080
called good. The same way I say, do not refer people to Autism Speaks. They're a hate group.

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:04.360
ASAN is a lot better. The same thing, we have to learn those resources from the people that

02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:08.920
are in the groups to find out what's accepted and what really puts the point across. And we

02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:16.520
have to make sure that we put this information out there. And be willing to speak up when we see

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:29.880
injustice done. Silence is complicity, is exactly how I see it. And indirect participation

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:40.680
is also an act of complicity. So I choose not to be complicit in the things that are antithesis

02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:47.320
to my belief system. And I believe that a transgender woman is a woman. I believe a

02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:52.520
transgender man is a man. I believe that a non-binary person is legitimately non-binary,

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:57.720
no matter what's in their knickers. Yes, I use a very southern word for underwear.

02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:09.480
I think that people who get their panties all in a bunch over other people just wanting the same

02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:18.120
rights as other people, honestly enough, I would like to see their roles reversed. I would love,

02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:23.880
I mean, and it's, you know, literature has tried to do this before. Like, for example,

02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:26.760
there was an old Superman comic where Lois Lane was black for a day.

02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:36.440
It's very controversial, but there are some times where I desperately wish that I could take a

02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:43.800
bigot and have them live a day in the life of one of the people they hate.

02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:53.640
And see what they're standing against and how ridiculously dangerous it is.

02:20:54.600 --> 02:21:00.680
I think, for me, too, the thing that is, if I can point my finger at what upsets me most about

02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:10.040
J. Karen Rowling and her viewpoints. Obviously, I find her viewpoints gross. But what really-

02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:11.320
Let's just call her Karen.

02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:16.520
What really sealed it for me was the fact that one of the pro-LGBT

02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:22.280
agencies, I want to say it was PFLAG, but I might be wrong. It might be a different,

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:28.680
GLAAD, it might be a different advocacy organization. They offered to talk to her,

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:35.800
sit her down one on one, educate her in a respectful environment and let her know why

02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:41.160
her words are hurtful. She turned them down. And that's where I have the problem is that

02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:46.280
somebody who refuses to be educated and refuses to even listen, that's a problem.

02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:54.040
I kind of go back to some things I said on the show a couple of weeks ago, and that is,

02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:56.600
I think it was the week you weren't here, Jamie, though, actually. But it was,

02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:02.040
fuck you, you fucking fuck has never won an argument. Never, ever in the history of ever

02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:06.280
has that won an argument. I quite frankly, some of this bullying and this stuff that's happening,

02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:10.200
I find it to be quite performative. I'm just going to say it. It's a performance.

02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:15.800
It's- I think a lot of it comes from a place where somebody, instead of doing actual hard

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:22.760
work to educate, they want to do a performance to show everybody, look, I'm such an ally,

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:30.280
I'm going to bully these people into submission. I'm sorry. That's disgusting. Wake up.

02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:35.560
That reminds me actually of a former mutual friend of both of ours.

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:37.880
Yeah, I know. I know. But-

02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:40.120
But it really is performative.

02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:44.440
It is. And the part that gets me, and this all comes back to the whole,

02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:49.480
there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. And I know some people don't want to apply that

02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:54.680
to this argument. I'm sorry. There's too many people that want to say, oh, well, it's not this

02:22:54.680 --> 02:23:01.000
because of this. It's not, you know, I'm sorry. You don't get to draw the fucking borders just

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:09.880
so that it works for you. And my case and point is the Twitter bullying. What the actual fuck

02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:20.200
are you doing, you fucking hypocrite? And the excuses I have seen people use. Oh, well,

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:25.080
Twitter is a public forum, so it's different and we owe it to ourselves to be here to-

02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:35.160
What? Twitter is not a public forum. It is not a publicly traded company. It is a private forum

02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:41.880
owned by one person who wants it to be the town square. But I ask you, do his actions

02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:46.520
that shove his tweets in your face, whether you want to or not, unless you blocked his ass,

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:53.240
is that representative of what the town square ought to look like? By the way, a same individual

02:23:53.240 --> 02:24:00.440
who wrote a tweet that said, and I quote, my pronouns are prosecute slash Fauci. You will

02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:06.680
turn a blind eye to that, to use that person's platform that generates those ad dollars to yell

02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:12.440
at your streamer that is streaming Hogwarts legacy. Now, again, I don't want to make it

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:18.440
sound like this whole like, no, it is you who are the bully and this whole thing. I'm not saying

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:22.040
that I love the fact that this game is getting all this attention and that, you know, people

02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:27.800
are streaming it. Again, I'm not going to watch it, but at the same time, you using Twitter to

02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:36.520
yell at those people like that makes you look like a stupid ass. And meanwhile, folks, guess

02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:42.920
what else is happening in the world? Drag queen, anti-drag queen library reading laws are being

02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:49.240
passed. Anti-trans bills are being passed. Did you know there's another bill that's going on?

02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:54.200
I want to say it's like Tennessee, Kentucky, probably both, honestly, that is trying to mirror

02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:59.400
what's going on in Florida. No, it's Indiana is the one that mirrors Florida. While you're all

02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:05.720
arguing about, is it ethical to play a video game on my Nintendo Switch when Nintendo is 8%

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:12.360
owned by a Saudi company now that, by the way, we know how, you know, that culture feels about

02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:22.120
LGBT rights. While we argue those ethics, actual fucking anti-laws are being passed. And what have

02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:32.600
you done from your Twitter account to stop this from happening? Nothing. You are useless with this

02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:40.680
bullying. Stop it. And even on top of that, like, I agree that for people who can't get out and do

02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:46.440
something, then helping to disseminate correct information via social media is perfectly valid.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:53.240
But to do nothing but rant without putting forward any sort of factual

02:25:54.280 --> 02:26:01.080
evidence. I mean, it's inherently a fallacious argument. You're just being an ass, like you said.

02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:09.240
And I think that all of us who profess our allyship need to do something. I mean,

02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:13.080
everything is going to have a degree of performance to it. That's just how our world is,

02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:21.640
even for the people who are just flat out saying, we're not, you know, I'm not going to play this

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:27.640
game and put it out publicly. You know, that's a little performative. I'll grant it. And I think

02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:34.280
in some cases there is a benefit to certain performative actions because it will bring

02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:39.720
attention to the thought or make someone who would otherwise have not seen that point of view look at

02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:51.480
it. But you have to back up the optics with the true action that goes behind it. You know, for

02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:59.000
example, if you are, say, say that you don't have money to donate and you are physically incapable

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:09.240
of going out and protesting, you can write a letter. You know, you can highlight charities,

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:16.520
you know, for, you know, like me, I can't donate to every charity that I want to as much as I want

02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:24.360
to. But as a streamer, I can run a charity. You can uplift trans and non-binary streamers

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.960
because guess what? When you go to hate watch another streamer that's playing Hogwarts Legacy,

02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:35.880
you're still watching and you're helping them to meet their partner metrics and you're helping to

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:43.800
meet their affiliate metrics. You really are. You're part of the problem. So why don't you take

02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:51.640
your view and give it to somebody else more deserving? Every action is going to have an

02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:57.880
effect no matter what. I mean, think of like that butterfly effect thing, if you will. You know,

02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:05.240
any little thing that you do is going to have an outcome. You deciding to take a breath could

02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:12.200
result in maybe a coughing fit because you're like me and you're still congested or it's the

02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:18.360
breath you need to take before darting away from someone trying to kill you. You know, it's all

02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:24.920
situational. And I think that you need to really look at the big picture. You need to think of how

02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:32.600
this action that I am doing right now, what is it going to cascade into? Because honestly,

02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:36.120
now the game getting all of this attention is because people did not think about what the

02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:46.440
fuck you were doing. Think before you act and do not react. Act. There is a difference between

02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:57.240
acting and reacting. Do not let another stimulus determine what you are going to do without looking

02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:01.800
at all sides of the thing. That's why I guess so. Honestly, that's partly why I left Facebook

02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:08.600
because it's such a fucking echo chamber and you need to be willing also to step outside of the

02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:16.200
damn echo chamber and look at another point of view. Fuck. If you are a diehard socialist like

02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:21.560
me, read Fox News, see what the other side is saying. Read the conservative media, see what

02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:29.400
the other side is saying. Look objectively at your own beliefs. Be critical of them. Be critical

02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:35.560
of what they're doing because you are not going to grow without challenge. And all of these people

02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:41.400
out there who are going and yelling at people, you know, that that's not challenging the other

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:45.960
person. That's going to lock them down. And you certainly are not challenging yourself to be

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:55.400
better. You are not an ally by performing this action. All right. Well, a lot of folks in chat

02:29:55.400 --> 02:30:03.160
are being thankful for the discussion tonight. So I'm I'm I'm glad we had it. I guess even though

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:07.640
I didn't really want to in the beginning, I feel like, OK, we've we've had the therapy,

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:15.400
we've aired it out. But let me be very clear. This all being said, fuck this game. I'm over it.

02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:18.280
I don't ever want to talk about this game again. There are-

02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:20.440
Fuck the game, fuck her, fuck everybody.

02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:25.560
There are many other things that are worthy of your attention. By the way, I just want to point

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:31.480
out the trans witches are witches bundle on itch.io is only about $11,000 short of its goal.

02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:40.520
And I'm not sure when the deadline is. Oh, till the 24th. So you only have about five more days.

02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:48.200
So if you want to maybe these are 69 nice games, I'd rather be talking about right now.

02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:56.120
I would rather talk about literally any one of these games than the one that won't go away.

02:30:56.840 --> 02:31:02.840
I like what you said. And by the way, real quick in our text message earlier, because I mean,

02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:06.600
I think I might have surprised you by saying I thought that it was really thoughtful email

02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:09.560
would provoke a good discussion. So I say we do it. And you said, all right.

02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:11.960
I know. I was like, yeah.

02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:17.960
But, um, but I like what you said that you treated as a Madden game. You're not interested.

02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:19.800
And it's because of her words.

02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:26.040
That's right. That that is what it is to me. The Madden games, they sell a ton. Some people find

02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:33.880
them to be great games. Cool. I'm still not interested. And that's at least the thing is,

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:40.280
I mean, I could come up with other problems about the NFL. But I just maybe it's a different type

02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:45.080
of thing. I'm just not interested in sports at the end of the day. Whereas, you know, in this one,

02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:50.440
it's her viewpoints have tarnished the pool or whatever you want to, you know, shit the bed,

02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:55.080
whatever analogy you want to use. But it's it's like the same thing. That's how I view it as a

02:31:55.080 --> 02:32:01.000
video game. I just I, there's other games to play. There are lots and lots of other games to play.

02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:06.440
And and I think that as you and I discussed a little bit earlier, you saw where I was coming

02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:12.280
from with needing to discuss it. And I'm really glad that we did because we have been quiet on it.

02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:19.960
But I feel honestly enough that as I mean, at least you and I being under the quilt bag, you

02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:27.800
know, and being and all of us being allies to our trans friends, we we have almost a responsibility

02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:35.080
to at least say something about it. And I'm glad that we did this. Garth, I absolutely appreciate

02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:43.080
your email. You are the MVP of this of this month. And I'm glad that we got it out. I actually feel

02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:50.120
better for getting this out. And I don't mind going back to not drawing any more attention to

02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:59.160
it. But I do think that as as allies, and as you know, part of the quilt bag, that we have

02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:06.680
a responsibility to say something, and I'm glad we did. And if nothing else, let the the failure

02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:11.640
of this boycott campaign be a lesson, because there's going to be other video games in the

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:18.120
future that you're going to have some opinions about. And your actions may actually have the

02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:23.560
opposite effect of what you're aiming for. Just just act and don't react.

02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:31.320
Think ahead, educate around corners. Educate. If somebody doesn't want to be educated,

02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:34.600
then that tells you all you need to know about your relationship with that person.

02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:40.680
But definitely learned how to look around the corner. anticipate and act accordingly.

02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.200
All right. Can you believe there's no one waiting to call in tonight?

02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:48.840
I want to talk to people now.

02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:50.040
Loki, are you alive?

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:51.800
I'm here.

02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:56.120
I'm gonna be late playing my dead by daylight, but this is worth it. I want people to call in.

02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:01.560
Call in because I said no, no, I I'm gonna actually say if nobody is waiting at this point,

02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.640
we're 15 minutes till nine o'clock in the night on the East Coast. I would like to go ahead and move

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:10.840
to start to wrap up tonight. But if you do have an email for a future week, participate at orange

02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:15.480
laundry.com is a great place to send it. I do want to check in real quick with Loki as well and see

02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:19.560
if there's any final thoughts or not final thoughts. I'm sorry, final last minute stories.

02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:20.680
I have one too.

02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:29.160
There wasn't too much. It was basically that the preorder bonus art book for was it Zelda,

02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:33.640
Tears of the Kingdom has leaked out early. So people are going to look at some of the artwork

02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:37.560
and stuff from the game that hasn't been shown yet. I don't really know what spoiler is it

02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:41.880
necessarily is. It doesn't really have everything. But yeah, looks like Zelda.

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:47.320
So although Toon Link is in there, so I guess that's somewhat of a spoiler. I don't really

02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:52.360
know what purpose that serves. But they have an image of Toon Link with the arm thing just like

02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.320
Link has in Tears of the Kingdom. So

02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:59.080
could be something with the amiibo, but I wouldn't read too much into it.

02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:03.160
It also just be like promo stuff or concept art.

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.520
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:07.240
Yeah, please.

02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:15.880
Um, Insight Editions announced that they are publishing an Amy Rose fortune telling card set

02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:22.280
based on the ones that were seen in Sonic Origins and also from the IDW

02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:31.080
comic series. And they're going to be available in October

02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:39.880
from Barnes and Noble and other online things and it'll be 25 bucks.

02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:46.840
The cards are really freaking pretty. Like, really well done. There's like chaos fruit

02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:50.760
and chaos emeralds and all kinds of stuff. It looks beautiful.

02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:56.600
So I just I just looked at chat. I know I usually don't mention these till after the show. But since

02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:00.440
we're wrapping down here, I noticed during that last discussion, y'all got us to a level three

02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:04.520
hype train. That's um, that's really incredible. Thank you so much. Thanks for being a cool

02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:07.800
community. I mean, y'all been really cool and chat with your comments and everything.

02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:13.640
So it's it's a nice refreshing change of pace from sometimes what I see on the rest.

02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:14.280
Hey, guess what?

02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:15.960
The internet. What's that?

02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:20.680
Oh, we've already finished. I tried to bump us to level four.

02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:29.800
Don't. Oh, well. That's all right. Um, okay. With that, let's wrap up. It's been it's been a good

02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:34.600
show tonight. But it's gonna have to last you for two weeks. We will not be here next week. Don't

02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:43.160
forget. And that's all my fault. And I am not sorry about it. But Jamie will still be streaming

02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:48.440
our pal Bobby Blackwell will be here with his usual show at eight o'clock Eastern five o'clock

02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:53.320
Pacific here at bog network. So you have plenty to watch just you know, just a week off otherwise.

02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:57.560
Those of you that have a three day weekend this weekend, I hope you have a nice long weekend.

02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.880
And plus, this is one of those weekends where I don't have to be like, remember why the holiday

02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:07.640
exists like it's President's Day. All right, cool sales, you know, like, it's, it's, it's whatever.

02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:12.920
So um, yeah, that's that's gonna do it for this week of orange was radio. If you enjoyed what

02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:17.560
you heard here, if you want to join our awesome community, please do we're here live on Sunday

02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:21.480
nights over at vog network. But of course, you can join us on Discord chat throughout the week,

02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:27.160
we still have our podcast family as well. Always you can email us, you could tweet us at OLR.

02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:31.880
Although I think I've made my issues with Twitter clear, but I'm trying I'm lazily keeping an eye on

02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:40.040
it. Not like I used to though, let me say that. And yeah, all that stuff. So tell a friend or

02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:43.160
two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every giver has a voice.

02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:47.960
But we need more voices here to put out on air a nice five star review on a site wherever you

02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:54.120
found this show, whether it was iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, podcasts, whatever it was, hit that five

02:37:54.120 --> 02:38:01.080
star button. If it has a review option, say they're cool. And leave a nice review. That

02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:06.040
would be great. With that, let's get to final thoughts. Dark Sakura, you're going to do all

02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:12.200
this and stream. So give us your final thought tonight. I'm I haven't decided if I'm going to

02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:17.480
do a killer only or play some survivor. So if anyone wants to Swift with me, you know where my

02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:24.120
chat is. All right. Have a good night, Jamie. We'll see you next two weeks. See you then.

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:28.760
I won't. All right, Loki, your final thought for tonight.

02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:37.960
My final thought is that I need to work faster at my Minecraft stuff. I think you're onto something

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:44.440
with maybe taking on smaller builds. I know you know, big projects. You're like my first game is

02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:49.560
going to be pixel poops number two. I'm not going to build a clone of solitaire. I'm going to just

02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:55.400
end. But hey, you know what? You get it done one way or the other because you got that pixel poops

02:38:55.400 --> 02:39:02.520
games done and which just celebrated a year if I'm not mistaken. And two years. Oh, how appropriate

02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:08.680
number two. And of course, your YouTubes are great. And people will people have got to find

02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:15.080
them eventually. So here's hoping. My final thought, I'll be streaming more theater than

02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:20.280
this week, probably not tonight, but tomorrow, Monday, and then probably a little bit Tuesday,

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:25.560
a little bit Wednesday. And then I'll be on streaming vacation for a week. And then by the

02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:30.440
time I get back, God, we're almost going to be into the Diablo four beta, which we didn't even

02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:35.320
talk about tonight, but the open beta is going to be happening there, and so forth. So there's,

02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:39.240
there's just a lot of stuff like I was looking at the stuff I want to stream this year. There is so

02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:47.160
much but yeah, streaming is is up and up. It's fun. Thank you for being here with us tonight as

02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:52.600
we're doing streaming and streaming this show. I hope you all have a great week. If nothing else

02:39:52.600 --> 02:40:01.640
from tonight's discussion, like treat each other with some decency. Educate. I don't know what else

02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:04.680
to say here at the end of the show. We hope to educate you a little more in two more weeks on

02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:07.800
what's going on in the gaming industry. Have a wonderful night, everybody. Take care of each

02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:16.200
other. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is a production of
