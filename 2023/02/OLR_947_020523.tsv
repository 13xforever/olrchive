0	20000	Theorhythm has had an interesting course of games. The album played style of the original release, the more expected select-whatever-you-want style of curtain call, and then an arcade game with a unique input method yet still a touchscreen.
20000	28000	And now, the arcade game comes to the Switch as Theorhythm's final bar line. House Biscuit doesn't pre-order, but this voiceover guy made an exception.
28000	37000	This is your music game update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	60000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 947 of our show for tonight, February the 5th, 2023. I can't believe it's already February, but you know what, I don't control time.
60000	89880	My name is Rob Roberts, and what I do control is being here every Sunday night with you all at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash vog network right after our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who is also on Sunday night's live. But of course, you can listen to us as a podcast as well where we've been available pretty much ever since podcasting has existed, and all your favorite apps such as iTunes, Spotify, what have you. I am joined tonight not by dark soccer or Jamie Summers. Unfortunately, she has fallen
89880	110720	ill. She's a bit under the weather. She's got more on her Twitter if you want to check that out over dark Sakura. But her voice is a little bit not able to do the length of the show tonight as a result. So obviously, I hope she recovers real soon and hoping to have her back on the show next week. Who I do have, though, is techmaster Loki here as always say hello, Loki.
111200	139520	Hello, how are you doing? I'm doing okay. I see here as we're broadcasting live you you tend to play some video games behind you on your, you know, little chat box screen discord box. And we've got some classic Zelda Wind Waker it looks like and this is I can tell by the three by four. This is the original Wind Waker and not the remake that they put on. That was on Wii U but then I think they put it on switch as well. I have a hard time. They never put only on Wii U. I feel
140120	144640	like everything on Wii U showed up on switch at some point. I have a hard time following sometimes. But why Wind Waker?
145440	167360	Um, because I went to the retro game store recently. And I was looking for well, we were looking for a few things. So I was telling my kids about like the Zelda DS games and stuff like that. So we're looking to see if we can find them because we went to a GameStop and they only had ochre enough time, which I did buy. But
167680	181720	like, like, it's just all part of that speculative market right now. Like the retro games that they have at the store are so expensive. They wanted and it wasn't a sealed copy, like $120 for Wind Waker.
182360	187880	Like, no, no, no, you're better off trying to find that type of stuff at an estate sale or something.
188480	191480	You can find an eBay much cheaper than that. Like even like
191480	197080	market who tends to mark up a little bit. I don't think marks up that high unless you have a permanent vendor.
197280	216040	It was ridiculous. I get it for like sealed games and stuff like that. But like non sealed stuff. No, like I have Wind Waker somewhere. My sister is borrowing it with my GameCube and lost it somewhere. I don't know where it is. But she had it at one point. But yeah, it's
217040	236000	do you think the retro game market is is on this like get rich quick thing because of all these stories we hear about Super Mario Brothers sealed boxes. Well, it was a whole it was a whole incident with that. But yeah, or or things that really are rare like that that Power Pad get stadium events or whatever the Power Pad game was before it became a world class track meet.
236400	265280	It's it's it is driven by that group. I mean, there's videos about it, like Carl jokes has done videos about the whole market. It's, it's artificially being inflated by them. It's, you know, basically the company that does the grading is own or they're in cahoots with the auction house. So obviously, it's well worth it for them to grade things higher than they probably should be. And then on top of that, they're selling it back to
265280	294800	themselves for $100,000. So like you watch like, who bought that first Super Mario Brothers or Super Mario 64, whatever it was that went for like over $100,000. It was somebody that was part of that auction house that bought it. So it's really dumb like these things. They're trying to do that to drive inflation in the market so they can turn a profit like a really huge profit on these things. And it's starting to crash now to like a lot of the game prices have dropped significantly, like
294800	313160	almost 75% from where they were before. But these guys did the same thing back in the 80s as well with I think like coins and I think they like same thing with a beanie baby stuff. They artificially inflate stuff by basically selling to themselves like they tried that with NFTs to like people tried.
313160	317840	Oh yeah, of course. I was just about to say it feels a lot like NFTs and Bitcoin.
317840	345480	Yeah, and it's it's unfortunate because it probably won't ever get back down to where things were before it will be more expensive. But yeah, it's like even just in the few months since I bought like my last NES games, because I went there and bought a bunch of things. But like, I was looking at like the different games that they had, like Mega Man and stuff like that they had a Mega Man, it was not sealed, just Mega Man one. They think they wanted like
345480	348400	it was just just Mega Man. It was
349080	359960	well, it was open. It was like it is an open copy. It's used. They wanted over $60 for that. I think it was 60 or $100 for that thing. I was like, no, like, I'm not gonna pay that
359960	389920	when you can get a lot of those games, you know, like in the digital market, and I get I get to a collector that doesn't mean anything. Like I remember when Suikoden 2 came out on PlayStation three in the PlayStation one classics catalog, because that game and the original Suikoden as well, because those games were very rare to find on PlayStation. And people were worried that it was going to cut the value of those CDs, but hooray accessibility for the rest of us, right, being able to get those games, you know, if we didn't have them, and now of course, the remasters are on their way, which is
389920	398640	also great news. But yeah, I just I think about stuff like that is that, you know, especially Mega Mega Man has been done a lot, you know, the legacy collection. Yeah.
399000	411880	And it wouldn't even be like, I don't know, like, I have a collection of Nintendo games, but like, they're sitting in a pile right here on my computer. Like they're not being played like my the Nintendo or the what's that? And yeah, I don't remember what it's called now.
412000	413440	Those retron things.
413680	441360	It's not a retron. It's an AVS. So yeah, retro USB AVS. So it does HD. It's like HD and covered in dust an HD. Like NES thing or something, but it like it's cool. It'll do like both the Famicom and the NES games in in HD. Plus I have a regular Nintendo as well.
441880	471580	If I don't want it to be in HD, but I just thought it's easier because I don't know, it's not as, you know, clean. And I just wanted to have like a small collection of games. It's just stuff I used to play. I remember like I bought Contra from that store, like not that long ago. It was like 12 bucks, went back there, you know, yesterday, and it was like $60. So it's, it's just dumb. Like, you can like honestly get that stuff much cheaper online now, like because it it is really
471580	488140	ridiculous, especially open games like sealed, I get it sealed, maybe really inflated, but open use stuff like I just don't get that these games aren't rare. Like Wind Waker is not a rare game by far. And it's just, I don't know.
488140	493060	They're trying to play into that people immediacy of people wanting it now or whatever, you know,
493140	499940	I mean, like, yeah, it's like Wind Waker, like, honestly, I'll just pirate that. I mean, I'll play it on an emulator in something like that.
500180	508980	It's a valid thing that the market should have to contend with in this day and age. You know what I mean? Like the reality is, there's so many ways to emulate that stuff, too.
508980	537540	Yeah, it's mainly I was just trying to share it with my kids is really the the goal behind it, especially like the DS stuff. Like I, I don't even know why by why we bought Ocarina of Time for the DS, or it wasn't the SS 3DS, but he's gonna be playing on 2DS. But at the same time, like, you know, actually, now that I think of it, we have that Nintendo online thing, like you probably just play it through there, and they would probably control better anyways, but whatever, you know, it was 25 bucks, whatever.
539500	542380	I don't know. It's just silly. Like it really is.
543060	556580	All right, heading over to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network because again, we tape live and you guys can comment along with the show. And there's actually a few people chime in on this topic because we have a lot of listeners that are into retro collections or have a passion for retro gaming, understandably.
556580	584700	Dr. Sia says reminds me of this time I was down here in 2013. The shop we went into wanted 50 bucks for cart only Donkey Kong classics on NES. Yeah, that's not a particularly rare game either. I think if you could find Donkey Kong or Donkey Kong Jr. on its own, which I do believe they did at one point, I know three was its own cart. I thought they did Jr. on its own cart, but pretty early on, they merged regular and Jr. into the Donkey Kong classics cart, which was not an uncommon find that
584700	593940	that they had as they had a common cartridge. They had a Donkey Kong. Just straight up Donkey Kong there for the NES. I don't remember how much
593940	623740	find those carts. Those are much rarer because they make nearly as many of them as they did classics. That's for sure. Or even a three probably because that game was really overlooked. Let's see other comments in chat here. Quest Buster says years ago I was looking for a copy of Snatcher for the Sega CD and pieced one together from two different auctions to make it cheaper. And a lot of people kind of say like online seems to be the way to go for some of these things. And yeah, I think kind of what I was referencing there is that a lot of these markets
623740	637500	may be praying and of sort I don't want to. I realize a lot of folks that run these stores are just people passionate about this as well trying to make a living and they have to price it where they feel they need to price it. So I don't want to make it sound like they're intentionally trying to
637500	647740	gouge but they're they are hoping that you need that immediacy of having this cart now or having this collectible now there is a sense of that that makes the market up.
647740	677420	Yeah, there's there's like, I mean, honestly, there were like things I was like, you know, I would have paid like there was, I don't remember what it was, it was something something that they had, I wanted to get a Legend of Zelda is what I wanted. And I know they said, Zelda to Adventures of Link, I think that they had a Zelda but I'm like, I don't know how much that is. And I really don't want to just pay like $60 for this. Like, honestly, when I'm looking for stuff like retro games, like I don't need a case for it doesn't
677420	707180	need to be in a box as long as it doesn't have like, like gross, you know, jam hand kid residue on the cartridge. And as long as like it's it's somewhat intact, you know, like, like, that is all that I care about. Maybe the label not like torn, you're just like, kinda, it can be dirty. That's fine. I've cleaned like several of these cartridges before but like, I'm not it's not a high bar to hit like really when I'm looking for stuff. So it's
708300	712220	she sounds like the villain in the next pixel poops game. Just saying.
713340	713660	Yeah.
715340	737340	All right. Dr. T says I think the rare one is DK Junior math for some reason that that was a thing. And that was a game for sure. And it's it is it wasn't that first wave of releases one of the black box original Nintendo releases. And I believe I think Nintendo was probably forced into doing that game because edutainment was
737340	767260	kind of a thing right around that time because there's that whole video games or rot your brain thing going on in the in the media a lot right so a lot of times game companies would have to try to put out something to show oh no games can be very educational like here's Donkey Kong Jr. teaching math and it's not a great game but it's there or Mario is missing. It was another one of those or but then of course we all know some edutainment games were so good they're etched in our brains now such as the Oregon Trail number munchers
767260	796900	Carmen San Diego you know there are a lot of games that did it very well for sure so dark to see it says there was a Japan exclusive one that was hangman but with Popeye that has surprised me as well. That's pretty cool. Also in chat, some comments on theater them going all the way back to Jason's introduction tonight. Some folks that were saying they didn't realize that theater that was an arcade game. Yeah, it was it was never officially released in America. But round one entertainment, which is in America that imports all the Japanese games, you could play it at
796900	826780	around one. I think by now the servers. I think the servers are offline at this point. You don't really see those machines in the wild. If you're lucky enough to know a private collector, you might still be able to play that arcade machine. But yeah, there was an arcade machine. It was really good. I loved it. I did get to play it a few times. And it had a similar version of the EMUs card that Konami has as a similar version of that. I don't remember the name of it. Somebody in chattel probably shouted out. Nesca maybe it was called
826780	855140	or that might have been one of the other companies, but they had its own card that you could save your scores and that whole thing too. Jijirome says Nesca. Okay, so I was I was close. So it was a card like that. So um, yeah, unfortunately, dark to see if you haven't played it yet. I doubt you're gonna find it at around one anymore. I think the servers were finally shut down. But the good news is, we have final barline that's going to be coming out pretty soon. And we'll talk about much more about that later in the show, because there's a demo that came out this week. So we'll get into that in a little while.
855780	868260	Also, also with some of those games, you know, with it, since most modern arcade games nowadays run on PC, some of the darker parts of the web, you may be able to find a version of the game that you can run on your PC and play it at home.
868260	870300	Mm hmm. Same as that.
898260	927540	So as kids that grew up on this stuff are now 40 somethings, like those of us hosting OLR and so forth, as the generations have gotten older, I think you see more and more video games in pop culture. And a huge example of that I know if I don't bring it up, somebody's gonna say in chat, why didn't you bring this up? A huge example of that would be last night's Saturday Night Live. I don't know if you saw this Loki, but Pedro Pascal apparently was the host who plays Joel in Saturday or in
928620	932220	The Last of Us, which is which is doing very well on HBO.
932900	933620	And yeah,
933660	935740	my wife is watching it without me right now.
935780	957780	Yeah, okay. Because it's on right now during the show, which by the way, you can watch on HBO Max anytime you want. You don't need to do it right now. But apparently last week's episode in particular was like people are saying like, if this doesn't win Emmys, then the Emmys are a joke. Like last week's episode was that good. And it also apparently was the first episode that DV and yes, I know all about what
957780	987340	happened and why in particular the story may resonate with me. Yes, I've heard everything about that. But but apparently it was their first place where they deviated from the game a little bit to tell a deeper backstory that wasn't in the game. And, of course, because of the fact that it involved the same sex romance. You know, people on the internet had something to say about it, as they tend to do. I don't have time to get hung up on what those people
987340	1016860	think. I'm just very glad that the art exists. I'm glad it's getting made. I'm somebody I'm glad somebody paid for that to be made. I'm glad that such talented actors like Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett did that role and played it to apparently perfection. I haven't seen the episode myself, but all I've heard is that it was really good. So I don't remember where I was going with this, but The Last of Us is doing great. And you know, this whole, they can't make good art out of video games. Curse is broken. Oh, yeah, the haters. I wanted to respond to the haters. So the haters are
1016860	1046860	saying, Oh, it deviated in. But if you wanted to see a shot for shot remake of the video game, play the video game. It's not going anywhere. And by the way, those same characters were gay in the video game. Gay. By the way, the creator of the video game is also working on the story of the show. So like, this is what they wanted to have to explore with it. So it's like,
1046860	1076860	it sounds to me again, I am not a huge Last of Us fan, not not a hater. I just don't have time to play every single video game. Right. But I honestly, the more I'm hearing about this, the more I'm like, okay, maybe I should just get over my I don't love to watch scary zombie stuff and watch this because apparently there's a lot more art there than you know what I'm giving it credit for what have you. So anyway, yes. And Bobby says we got on this tangent because of SNL. Yes, I sure did. So last I started out live did that whole Mario Kart
1076860	1106580	sketch, which you know, had Pedro Pascal as Mario and it was like a dark version of Mario and it was, it was really funny. But you have to kind of look at that. And what I really, really was getting at before was about the whole like video games will rot your brain. Here we are now full circle that when Saturday Night Live is making references about video games like Mario Kart, it's because everybody's played Mario Kart. And it's interesting that they picked Mario Kart in particular, they didn't pick Super Mario Brothers with the movie coming out.
1106860	1135420	They picked Mario Kart. But like, seriously, way more people know Mario Kart and have played Mario Kart than don't at this point, no matter what your age, what's your gender or any of that stuff. It's, you know, Mario Kart, Mario Kart is a universal language at this point. And that's what made that sketch so good, I think. And so many people laughed and liked that. So yeah, I just, I had to bring it up. It was really, it was funny and well done. Yeah, and Tigerclaw points out the production value on that sketch was pretty good.
1135900	1138980	The art department was really working over time for that.
1139020	1153580	Yeah. A lot of people are like, I would watch that show. I got 90s Super Mario Brothers movie vibes, but like, not in a bad like a lot of you gonna be like, I like how they remember how he was kind of trying to go like, dark and gritty. Yeah, it's like,
1153700	1164500	I like how they were making fun of like the the Chris Pratt, like react, like the reaction to his voice in the Mario trailer and stuff because they did the two lines from the trailer in that and it was great.
1164660	1175060	Yeah, so I and of course, I love the whole Bo and Yang, who I think is hilarious doing the whole like, I'm Yoshi and I'm bisexual. It's funny.
1176620	1178860	I'm Toad and I'm also bisexual.
1180420	1182260	But didn't he do it in the voice?
1183060	1192860	Yeah, it's just it was hilarious. The whole thing was just like, it's it's just silly. I mean, that's what it's supposed to be. Like, I don't know, people are getting bent out of shape about that.
1192860	1195700	Saturday Night Live is supposed to be funny. It isn't always but
1195740	1203820	we live in the 21st century and there are people that are bisexual out there. I know. Don't be alarmed. But they're out there. You know? So
1203820	1221820	what? I don't know. Oh, my God. All right. Yeah. Tiger call. I was saying people were calling for Pedro Pascal to be the voice of Mario in the animated movie. I'm gonna put it this way. A lot of people that would say that about Pedro Pascal, including me, would also say that Pedro Pascal can do anything he wants.
1222420	1223620	Yeah, to me.
1224620	1226820	Okay, yeah, you can do whatever you want to rub.
1228740	1251660	All right. Anyway, uh, let's see. Um, well, I want to get into tonight's topic, too. I actually want to address something else. I know we're being a little light heartened. I hate to bring things down. I didn't warn you about this, Loki. But I got a vent about something kind of going on a little bit personally, because we do that here on the show sometimes, right? It's a long show, because sometimes we talk about what's going on in our personal lives and so forth.
1252660	1266780	And I want to bring this up, because I think when I'm in like a weird headspace, I think we should be transparent about that sort of thing. You know, because it's it's okay to not be okay, right? I'm not saying I'm not okay. But like, definitely my day just got like, like, derailed a little bit.
1266780	1296780	Um, I found out earlier to y'all know, I play Ingress, right? And which is, you know, the same company that makes Pokemon Go. And, you know, out of these GPS locations, you take, you know, things in the park, and you know, the same things that are pokey stops and that sort of thing in Pokemon Go. And it's like a player versus player game. There's a lot of, there's a lot of intense strategy that goes on in it, right? Because it is player versus player, and you're always kind of trying to think two steps ahead of what the other team might be doing. And you're, you know, planning with the other team, and you're, you know, planning with the other team, and you're, you know, planning with the other team, and you're, you know, planning with the other team, and you're, you know, planning with the other team, and you're, you know, planning with the other team, and you're, you know, planning with
1296780	1301340	other people on your own team, working together to get gear and all that stuff, right? So I don't mean
1301340	1305100	to be a commercial for the game, but I do play it a lot. It's been very good for like my exercise and
1305100	1311180	so forth. Um, long story long, I found out earlier today that one of my teammates that I played the
1311180	1316860	game with passed away on January 17th, actually, and we just found out about it today, just because
1316860	1323820	some mutual friends that we knew ended up doing, because we also seem to roll in some similar
1323820	1329660	communities. There was some overlap with like Rocky Horror leads to Goth leads to steampunk.
1329660	1333580	So we had some like common friends as well. And I, you know, I'm not looking for condolences or
1333580	1338700	anything like that. Thank you. I do appreciate it. But I was not super tight with this individual,
1338700	1346380	but we were two people playing the same game, who had that, you know, like professional, it sounds
1346380	1351340	weird to say, but we had that respect. I think that that gaming respect for each other. I knew
1351340	1356540	like, Hey, I need a teammate to do something for me. Like, Hey, I'm going to go drop this link.
1356540	1359740	Could you throw a blocker? Cause I see you're right here. Can you throw something so they
1359740	1362940	can't re-throw it? You know, he would do that sort of thing and I could do the same thing for
1362940	1367980	him or go bump a portal or whatever. Like that's, you know, we, we had a good professional game
1367980	1374300	and ship relationship. And, um, you know, it's a little weird to find out like two weeks after the
1374300	1380380	fact that that person is gone. I had noticed that he wasn't active in the game, but people go,
1380380	1385340	people go inactive for all sorts of reasons. They go on a trip, the holidays happen. They
1385340	1390300	just want a fricking break. And so it wasn't until I saw this post on Facebook from other
1390300	1393580	overlapping communities where it was like, we haven't heard from him in like two, you know,
1393580	1397740	two weeks where it was like, Oh, what's good. And then one thing led to another and, you know,
1397740	1403340	they found out that he had actually passed away. Um, but you know, thinking about all this in the
1403340	1407340	context of like video games, it really is just a harrowing reminder, especially because things
1407340	1413420	could get very intense in player versus player games sometimes like Ingress and there can be
1413420	1421180	smack talking sometimes and that sort of thing. It is a very harrowing reminder that we're all
1421180	1426860	fricking human. And especially in this gaming space, sometimes I'm not, this isn't like a call
1426860	1432780	out for Ingress or anything like that. It's just, this has me thinking about other video games and
1432780	1439020	some of the venom that I've seen in video games in like, let's say a Dead by Daylight post game
1439020	1444620	chat, an MMO party where somebody wasn't pulling their weight or didn't know the fights. So there's
1444620	1452540	other people that start yelling at them. The venom that happens on social media all the time,
1452540	1458860	you know, because of a gaming opinion, or because a certain person is involved with games or because
1458860	1464380	they changed the plot of a television show to tell a different artistic side of a story that
1464380	1469580	started in a video game, you name it. It's just one of those things where it is just a harrowing
1469580	1482220	reminder. Video games are played by people, actual living, breathing, existing people.
1483260	1487180	And spare me the talk about the AI that does things that games done quick. You all fucking
1487180	1492140	know that's not what I'm talking about right now. For the vast majority of games are done by people
1492140	1496220	and when you're playing against these Caesars, it's played by people. And yeah, what Mike Deaf
1496220	1500860	says in chat, we're all people in the end. And we never know when that end is going to happen. So
1502460	1511500	like just fucking treat gamers, treat people with that professional sportsmanship,
1511500	1515500	game and ship because we're all in this together. We're all a bunch of nerds.
1517420	1520700	I don't know. I don't know what else to say. It's just one of those things where it's like,
1522060	1526300	you know, I remember being at events with this guy where we're farming gear together and it was,
1526300	1529740	oh, you're here. Hey, how you doing? How you been? Oh, okay. Yeah. Hey, I think I saw you
1529740	1533500	with that thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, the catch up and it's just like one of those
1533500	1539820	things where you just kind of like realize like, fuck. I had my last conversation with him.
1541500	1551180	And now that's that. So anyway, yeah, thank you, Darcy. Darcy points out even with the robots,
1551180	1557980	people wrote the codes. That's for sure. All right. Anyhow, sorry, I had to get on a soapbox
1557980	1562220	a little bit there. But it's just, you know, I again, just that whole thing just led me to
1562220	1568940	thinking about and maybe this is part of like me reactivating Twitter again. And I had my reasons
1568940	1572700	for doing it. And if you want to see them go read my Twitter because that's really all I have to say
1572700	1580940	about it. But like, I'm gonna be honest, I don't enjoy being on Twitter. Not anymore. Because when
1580940	1591020	you read it, it's just a bunch of crap. And it's people wanting to block, cancel, ruin people,
1591020	1595580	people for whatever their opinion is that's different than theirs, whatever it is.
1595980	1603900	And when was the last time when in the history of ever was the last time that fuck you, you fucking
1603900	1614220	fuck change somebody's mind. You know what changed people's mind? Education. And if you can't
1614220	1621500	understand that, then you're part of the problem. Period. End of sentence. Anyway, I need to get off
1622300	1629180	my high horse before I say something that gets me in trouble. Let's see, Loki on a little bit more
1629180	1633900	of a light hearted note, I noticed you changed your background because clearly something I said,
1634540	1636620	set off like a memory thing for you.
1636620	1640460	No, this is originally what I wanted as my background, but I couldn't think of a way to do
1640460	1641900	it. And then I just figured out a way to do it.
1642620	1646860	So please help me lighten the mood. Let's talk about this. Speaking of AI,
1646860	1651100	talk about this latest phenomenon that is just it's awkward as hell.
1651900	1662220	Is it is great. It is so this is nothing forever. It is the it's an AI generated Seinfeld without
1662220	1669980	being Seinfeld. And it goes on forever has AI generated animation, AI generated dialogue,
1670540	1678540	AI generated voices. And it's just it's just Seinfeld forever. And it's it's it's silly.
1678540	1685740	And I don't understand why I've watched so much of it this week is beyond me, but it is entertaining
1685740	1692460	because it's so broken. And I love it. And it looks like like especially Larry, the main
1692460	1698300	character who is actually you know, obviously Jerry Seinfeld. Larry looks so much like Guybrush
1698300	1703980	Threepwood that I think that's what's fascinating as well. And then you have George who is in this
1703980	1711500	is Fred. And then I think Yvonne and I can't remember who Kramer's character is called, but
1713260	1721340	it's just silly and stupid. And broken. It's it's it's such a time waster, that's for sure.
1722860	1726380	Fifth Dream in chat says something sorry to go back to the previous topic, but I need to because
1726380	1730940	Fifth Dream in chat brings up an important point I need to clarify says, Nah, fuck you,
1730940	1735260	you fucking fuck is a lot less vile than we want to take away rights and I'll die on that hill
1735260	1739580	probably. I want to say something real quick. I didn't say I was talking about anything specific
1739580	1744460	in particular number one. So I want to make that that very clear. I'm not about to get into
1744460	1749660	any of the variety of the thousands of messes that are going on online. But I will just say
1750620	1756860	do do not throw rocks when you live in a glass house. That's for sure. Because and again,
1756860	1761420	do not do not make assumptions that you know what I'm talking about. But I'm just saying in general
1761420	1769100	what I see on social media is that people here's the thing. It blows my fucking mind that people
1769100	1775500	use Twitter in the first place as that. Are you not aware that there is one person that makes
1775500	1781100	money at Twitter? Are you not aware there is one person now there's no stockholders. There's no
1781100	1785740	board. There's one person at the end of the day that makes money. Do you know that that person
1785740	1791180	makes pronoun jokes? Do you know that that person denies science? Do you know that that person says
1791180	1798700	a variety of problematic things on that platform? And nobody cares. Everybody is turning a blind
1798780	1805260	eye to it. I have to turn a blind eye to it because no one else would leave that platform
1805260	1811580	behind. And for my own sanity of being able to promote my own stuff and you know use that
1811580	1817340	platform and not have myself be deplatformed this sort of thing, I had to reactivate. So
1817340	1823980	if you're starting a social justice war on Twitter, I don't know what to tell you. You
1823980	1829980	are willfully turning a blind eye. However, that being said, I do want to do this,
1830860	1838300	saying we'll take away rights and I'll die down on the hill. As is understandable. But again,
1838300	1843260	if you tell somebody fuck you, you fucking fuck, they're going to respond negatively in that sort
1843260	1850940	of thing. But if you tell them, hey, this is why this is a toxic thing. This is why I don't support
1850940	1855820	it. This is what it leads to. You educate them. You let them make the decision. And at the end
1855820	1862380	of the day, you can choose who you hang out with and who you don't. And believe me, believe me,
1862380	1869020	over the years, I've educated many people. And depending on how they respond to that,
1869020	1878300	I've chosen the company I keep from that. So anyway, I just needed to make sure I got it.
1878300	1884380	And I get it. And your point is valid. Catharsis is a thing. Sure, it is. But unfortunately,
1884380	1891420	it's become like a broken record on a lot of that stuff. So just food for thought. I'm sure
1891420	1898060	somebody will come at me on social media, but let me just tell you, I'm too old to really give a
1898060	1904700	fuck about it anymore. I'm just going to say, again, you better examine your own fucking house
1904700	1911180	before you come for mine. Because if you don't, I'll be very happy to point things out for you
1912220	1917980	if you try it. All right. Anyhow, let's lighten the mood here a little bit
1918940	1925820	and change the topic. Let's change the topic to one of our classic unfortunate punching bags of
1925820	1931660	the last few years ever since this show has gone downhill a little bit as well. Let's talk about
1931660	1935900	the latest and greatest with the E3 show. Loki, what do we want to talk about tonight?
1936700	1944620	So E3 is going forward, despite the fact that, you know, Sony, Microsoft,
1944620	1951340	Nintendo are not going to be going to E3. It's E3 without the, you know, three.
1951900	1962620	So. Reminds me of that EA Sports thing where they have like, it's a E, E, E, E, E, E.
1962620	1969820	But yes, IGN apparently spoke with, you know, Phil Spencer, and they said it was the timing of its
1969820	1975180	showcase and the convenient for the it's more convenient for the press and even consumers,
1975180	1983580	suggesting that they will be held at the same time as E3. Sony hasn't participated in E3 since
1983580	1991020	2018. And Nintendo, you know, they also haven't participated in E3 in a very long time.
1993820	2001820	Of course, the ESA has come out and addressed the issue. They have neither confirmed nor denied it.
2001820	2008220	It's probably true then. It's, you know, it's a bunch of fluff. I'm trying to like get through
2008220	2014460	the fluff here. Yeah, there's really nothing of importance that they say. It's just basically
2014460	2018060	talking about how important E3 is, except it's not going to be important because no one's going
2018060	2025420	to be there. So. I don't know, this this kind of comes off a lot like E for all back when they did
2025420	2029180	that thing, because most of the people weren't participating. I think actually they had Nintendo
2029180	2034540	at that point, but most studios were not participating. Microsoft did that show,
2034540	2045180	not Nintendo. Oh, okay. It's just, I think it's, it'd be interesting to see what their
2045180	2053260	turnout is this year. I think it's grossly unnecessary. But somebody's getting something
2053260	2058380	out of it. I'm sure. I, you know, what's, you know, what's funny, I actually, you know,
2058380	2063900	looking back, I know we all kind of like to joke about E for all, I actually think the industry
2063900	2069900	had a good idea there. I and I know, I know, laugh, do your thing. I actually think the
2069900	2073820	industry had a good idea there. The ESA just didn't know how to implement it because they're the ESA.
2075660	2080300	Especially how mismanaged the ESA was that time. Look at other conventions that celebrate
2080300	2086220	the gamers that are doing just fine for themselves, such as PAX, you know, for all the
2086220	2089900	criticisms I've lobbied at PAX over the years, they're making money, they're well attended.
2089900	2095660	And now the people behind PAX are coming in to do E3 to basically turn it into PAX Southwest.
2095660	2100700	That's, that's basically what it's going to be at this point. It's just PAX without the name PAX.
2100700	2110460	And, um, uh, you look at TwitchCon was very, you know, I think well attended and a really good
2110460	2115260	networking opportunity for gamers. And what did the industry love about E3?
2115980	2122060	Being able to be a networking opportunity for industry people, right? I think if they had
2122060	2129260	played E for all smarter, probably the ESA at that time should have let somebody else come in
2129260	2133180	and help them do that. And maybe they did, but if they did, they didn't show it very well. They
2133180	2137740	didn't, you know, do a very good job, whatever, you know, we all know how it, how it went.
2137740	2143420	But maybe if they had tried to play into a little bit sooner, the idea of getting influencers,
2143420	2147900	networking with other gamers and other, you know, content creators who existed at the time,
2147900	2152380	because I remember our old network, All Games Radio was there with a presence. I wasn't there
2152380	2156460	personally, but I know our old network was. So there was the concept of content creators,
2156460	2161820	podcasters, and all that stuff was around. And I think if E4ALL had played their cards better,
2161820	2167740	as opposed to, oh, we're just making E3, but everybody can come to it. I think it would have
2167740	2173660	done a lot better. And so what am I supposed to think of this new E3? Oh, oh, it's, it's like
2173660	2180380	E3, but everybody can come to it. Girl, we've been down this road before with the, so at least this
2180380	2185660	time, Readpop is doing it. I have my own problems with them based on history with PAX, but that's
2185660	2193580	fine. That's my issue. And I'm sure that the show itself will do okay. But what could be interesting
2194140	2199260	is this whole news. Now, have you heard this other rumbling about Microsoft is apparently doing a
2199260	2206540	show the week before? Have you heard that rumbling? I have not. But you know who else just announced
2206540	2213340	that they're doing a show the week before? Geoff Keighley, Summer Game Fest. Now we don't have
2213340	2222620	anything solid yet, but could it be that Geoff Keighley has done what the ESA don't
2224620	2230540	and created a new trade show that people want to go to? Does Geoff Keighley have that kind of power?
2231500	2238300	I would say yes. Has the ESA flopped that hard from the mismanagement of that company in the
2238300	2242140	mid, I know it has a different leader now than it did in like, I think the last guy was there from
2242140	2251420	like 2008 to like 2014 or something. That guy fucked the ESA. He did not know what he was doing
2251420	2257340	and that, you know, we all know that show lagged behind and so forth. So has Geoff Keighley become
2257340	2264700	relevant and a speaker for the gaming industry where the ESA has not? Yeah, I think he has.
2264700	2269820	I think Geoff Keighley has single handedly ended the ESA to some extent.
2271980	2273980	Am I being a little bit overdramatic? Maybe.
2277900	2282220	Like, I don't think we really need like, an entity that, you know,
2282220	2287740	defends game companies. Especially for all the stuff that they do nowadays.
2289580	2293660	Can I point something out? That's a great question. What the fuck does the ESA do?
2293660	2300860	Let's go to the source. Let's go to the source. The ESA is where the major players of the video
2300860	2306380	game industry work together to support the bright future of video games, right? We are the video game
2306380	2309660	industry re-managing entertainment for billions of players so that together we work to expand the
2309660	2314140	frontiers of what is possible in entertainment, and so forth. And then leaders, but it doesn't
2314140	2321100	really show about, okay, we do a smart advocacy, working with Congress and the administration.
2321100	2328540	What, what did you do? Protect the game industry, not to protect gamers.
2328540	2333980	What did you protect? Like, where were they like, with all these predatory practices that
2333980	2338380	people are implementing? No, they're for it. Let's, let's go to the press room. Let's go
2338380	2343180	to the press room and see. Let's see what kind of ongoing activism the ESA has done.
2343900	2349740	Let's see. Consumer video game spending is high. Okay. That the ESA had nothing to do with that,
2349740	2356780	but okay. Let's see. Oh, all the way back now to September. There has been one story
2357980	2364300	since September. There has been one thing the ESA has triumphed to success
2364300	2366460	that they had nothing to do with since September.
2370060	2376780	Okay. Let's see. In September, meet Rashi Sika, Ubisoft's VP of global diversity and inclusion.
2376780	2381020	Cool. I mean, that's, that's a great thing to highlight. Awesome. We know Ubisoft had to
2381020	2385980	fucking get dragged to the fucking mud for that to happen. But, uh, and you know, the ESA maybe
2385980	2390460	could have done something to, uh, intervene a lot sooner and made that, but okay. Okay. Well,
2390460	2395020	we'll celebrate the success of where they've gone. Okay. And then we go back to June.
2399180	2405340	So in the last, what is that? Six, eight months, the last eight months,
2407100	2411420	the ESA has triumphed to successes, neither of which they've actually played a hand in.
2412060	2415980	Yeah. So like some of the stuff that they do, they say engaged in government lobbying.
2415980	2421420	So they spent $1.1 million. It says lobbying efforts with Washington, DC.
2422220	2430140	Uh, it, they've been a proponent of proposed anti piracy SOPA PIPA. Cause those weren't like
2430700	2441900	absolute garbage. Um, they also were pushing to, uh, is anti copyright stuff, like making sure
2441900	2446140	that, you know, copyright protection is in place. I mean, that's good for the industry,
2446140	2451660	but it's also like the copyright system in the United States is messed up as it is. And,
2451660	2455660	you know, further meddling in it, I don't think is going to help, but the fact that they were very,
2455660	2461580	you know, pro SOPA and PIPA is just, that's all you need right there.
2463660	2467180	Anyway, what, what has the ESA done for this industry?
2473020	2476780	Nothing. Do not adjust your radio set. We, we are unable to think of anything. We're,
2476780	2481820	we're thinking we're thinking a long time. They're also in favor of loot box mechanics
2481820	2484140	and argue that it doesn't constitute gambling.
2485180	2491900	Anyway, I think, I think we've made our point. I think we've made our point to me. This is not
2491900	2500140	about E3 no longer being relevant. E3 lost its relevancy a long time ago because the ESA already
2500140	2508940	killed it. This is about the ESA no longer being relevant. Does that mean the game industry doesn't
2508940	2514540	need, doesn't want something like this? Doesn't want a trade show? Doesn't want somebody to work
2514540	2520540	hard to give the video game industry a professional face, such as through a yearly
2520540	2525740	award show that they've tried very hard to work up into a prestigious event and sort of artistic
2525740	2532140	merit that the industry deserves? Did the ESA do that? Remind me, Loki, did the ESA do that?
2533820	2534140	No.
2534140	2534780	Who did that?
2535740	2537020	I believe it was Jeff Keighley.
2538460	2541980	Or there's also the game, the GDC stuff too, but that also wasn't the ESA.
2542620	2547420	Now look, this isn't just about me trying to like eat Jeff Keighley's ass. That's not what
2547420	2552300	I'm trying to do here on this program. Okay. But I'm just going to say, look at the receipts.
2553580	2560060	And now you see that this, you know, latest rumor about Microsoft teaming up with Jeff Keighley for
2560060	2566140	a show the week before. That's because somebody produced results and now the industry is going
2566140	2576060	to follow that somebody. And it's as simple as that. Let's see. Oh, hi, DarkSakura, who is in
2576060	2581260	chat tonight. Hello, hello. Said they had cool t-shirts a few years ago. That was one good thing
2581260	2584620	they did. You're right. They did. They did have, they had some good t-shirts. They sure did.
2584620	2592380	S.H.O. and Hunter Matt says, ReadPop is throwing a high school party with its parents,
2592380	2597420	ESA there and only serving Hawaiian punch. Jeff is the cool kid with the cool house and has a
2597420	2605740	keg at his party. That is a very good comparison actually. So we'll just marinate on that for a
2605740	2613580	little bit. All right. Anything else to add on that story? No. All right. Well, this is something
2613580	2618220	that's going to be continuing to develop. And I would say watch carefully this news about Summer
2618220	2623660	Game Fest, because again, we are kind of working on maybes and stuff, but this whole like Microsoft's
2623660	2628620	doing a thing the week before, Jeff Keighley's doing a thing the week before this, this is going
2628620	2634460	to add up to where there is smoke, there is fire. Yeah. It's going to be interesting to see what
2634460	2641340	they're, what the show looks like, like how many people actually are going to attend. And really
2641420	2646940	like, yeah, the, the, the audience, or was it the consumer version of the show is only like
2646940	2654220	two days long too. It's not like at least three or four. So. She Hold 10, no, sorry. She Hold 10
2654220	2658460	and Chat said there should be a Super Bowl of video games and the studios releases their best
2658460	2664620	video games for the show ready to play. I certainly do not disagree with that, but who do you think is
2664620	2672620	closer to making that a reality right now? The ESA or the brains behind the video or the video
2672620	2680540	game awards and Summer Game Fest? Who's closer to that reality? I let the track record speak for
2680540	2687180	itself. Is the ESA doing anything about the rampant sexual abuse of, you know, employees and the,
2687180	2692220	the hostile workplaces that all these companies that their members, by the way, have like
2692220	2696060	Activision Blizzard is a member of the ESA. They addressed it in any of that.
2699340	2709660	Nope. But didn't Jeff Keighley open one of his shows with a pretty big, you know, kind of,
2710380	2713820	I seem to remember he made a very strong worded statement. I mean, which, you know,
2713820	2716700	some people kind of gave him crap for that, but at least he said something he didn't try to
2716700	2721820	ignore it. Right. Didn't he open? I want to say it was the 20, not this 2021 game awards with a
2721820	2727260	pretty, you know, direct statement about what was going on in the industry. I seem to recall
2727260	2733500	that was the thing. So again, I'm really not trying to get in bed with him. I'm just saying
2735020	2738940	when this news comes out, that seems like it's about to come out. This is why.
2742220	2746780	All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we
2746780	2750540	have been playing this week, whether someone told us to or not. Loki, how was your gaming week?
2751180	2758220	I played a few things this week or two things this week. So I played, you know, Minecraft. I also
2758220	2764700	played around in YouTube analytics world. That's been my way. Yeah. Fun. That's a fun stuff.
2766540	2774060	And then I also played, we did our first community event for Channel 64. So we played
2774060	2782380	Power Washing Sim. We went through the DLC for Lara Croft because they have the Tomb Raider
2782380	2788380	DLC in there. So we did the treasure room, which is kind of fun. And then before that,
2788380	2794220	I had actually played with him with Arrington through the mansion front, I guess.
2795340	2800380	I like more Power Washing Sim content, especially since it's free. That's awesome.
2800380	2807500	Is that it? That's it. I will piggyback on that then, because I also played the
2807500	2811100	Power Washing Sim DLC. I didn't get nearly as far as you did though, because I was playing by
2811100	2815580	myself and, you know, even cleaning the front of that mansion is quite the undertaking. When you
2815580	2820540	have to use one of those like two tier ladder things to get to certain parts. That was pretty
2820540	2824220	impressive, but it's an impressive piece of DLC. And I'm really excited for some of the future
2824220	2829260	stuff they have coming, which I think we'll get to later in the show. So that was fun. I've been
2829260	2833820	oddly playing more Dead by Daylight. You know, I know we talked about the game a lot on the show,
2833820	2838540	but the reality is it's it's been a game that has brought a lot of hours of entertainment.
2839980	2844460	A little less entertainment ever since that night DLC came out. But you know, they did the worker
2844460	2850300	with a tweaking patch. And I have found that the new indicators have made so with because they
2850300	2857900	added indicators when you're playing in solo queue that make it a lot easier to see what other
2858460	2864860	people are doing. And I have found that I have a much easier time in solo queue with that. So it's
2864860	2868460	kind of energized me to play solo queue again, I've actually worked my way through the first page
2868460	2874940	of the tome. I'm never current on tomes. So that's been very interesting in Dead by Daylight. So
2874940	2876300	Hey, you said Dead by Daylight.
2877340	2880300	Did I say Dead by Daylight three times in the mirror and some in the entity?
2881420	2882620	Yeah, it's Nia.
2882620	2885180	Because you sound like the entity right now. Hi, Dark Sakura.
2885180	2885740	Hi.
2885740	2887180	I hope you're feeling better.
2888220	2893980	I, I've been coughing a lot. So that's why I'm not here. Because I can't talk on without coughing.
2893980	2901980	Yeah. But, but you were bringing up the, the HUD changes in DBD. And God, they're convenient.
2901980	2904380	Yeah, you can tell who's doing jack shit.
2904940	2905820	Oh, isn't it great.
2906380	2908940	And then and then you sandbag them.
2909900	2916940	I hit eerie. I'm still eerie one. And that's also fun, because I can be a jerk.
2916940	2921740	Yeah, I, I actually played a killer game as well. And that did not go well for me.
2922860	2927180	But it was, it was fun to try, I guess, because I was like, Oh, I got I've gotten almost every
2927180	2930940	survivor thing in this tome, I should go for some killer ones. And I played a Vommie Mommy match
2930940	2935500	because I love playing plague. Miss plague is probably my killer main at this point. And it
2935500	2936460	did not go well for me.
2936460	2942300	Yeah, I'm not looking forward to having to work on her prestige. I still haven't played
2942300	2949340	Wesker or Knight yet. And it's gonna have to happen. But I did get two more adepts for killer.
2949340	2951100	I got a doctor and huntress.
2951820	2952860	Oh, huntress.
2955020	2961340	I watched. There's a guy on YouTube called mint skull, who talked about the hit box for
2961340	2964940	characters. And so that if you play huntress aim for the butt.
2965900	2966380	Interesting.
2966380	2972780	I aimed for the button it worked. And there's also like, certain levels, you can actually throw
2972780	2976860	right at like the top of a fence and still hit them through it because of where the hitbox is.
2976860	2977900	Oh, interesting.
2977900	2978940	I'll find you the video.
2978940	2983180	Yeah, I don't know if I'll play huntress anytime soon, but it's interesting.
2983740	2985020	It held my game.
2985020	2985520	Yeah.
2986060	2987980	Anyway, I just wanted to stop in and say hi.
2987980	2991980	No, it's it's good to see you appreciate it. Anything else you want to drop in our
2991980	2993020	ears before you take off?
2993660	3001260	Um, it for anyone who says the pandemic is over. I was in the office for two days.
3001260	3002060	We'll leave it at that.
3003020	3004060	We'll feel better soon. Okay.
3004620	3005180	Thank you.
3005180	3006460	All right. We'll see you next week. Bye.
3008300	3011260	All right. Um, let's see. So what else am I gaming week? I've also played some more
3011260	3016060	Final Fantasy 14. I did some streaming of that I found that I like playing paladin now.
3016060	3019260	I got my island sanctuary to rank 12. I think that actually happened last week,
3019260	3021740	though. I can't remember what I didn't didn't talk about. So I'll leave it at that.
3021980	3025900	But I will also mention I played Pokemon Go today for quite some time.
3026540	3029340	I did some walking around did a lot of Bluetooth catching.
3029340	3034860	I don't know. Does anyone need 17 shiny noi bats? Because I got you.
3034860	3036940	If you need 17 shiny noi bats.
3040220	3042220	I mean, I don't need those.
3042220	3046780	I don't know what I'm going to do with that many shots. And honestly, probably.
3047340	3050940	Shane probably got twice as many. I haven't checked in with him. I should text him when
3050940	3057260	you're talking next. So I can find out. But I know that's kind of a niche Pokemon.
3057260	3060940	The only reason this community day is a big deal is because he takes he's super rare and
3060940	3068620	Pokemon go and he takes 400 candies to evolve. So this is one that you know is a lot harder to get.
3068620	3072860	Pod culture says send me one I didn't get any as soon as they implement long
3072860	3076860	distance trading. I'm happy to or if you're coming to dragon con this year or whatever,
3076860	3083420	wherever I see you next. I'm happy to give you one. Yes. So yeah, but I'm not gonna I'm not
3083420	3087900	going to send these guys to the shredder either just because they're shiny. I'll just hang on to
3087900	3093180	it. I guess. Fifth dream does say one of my very favorites. Yeah, it is a cool Pokemon. But yeah,
3093180	3098860	I walked five miles and caught 17 shinies over Bluetooth. So I'm pretty proud of myself.
3098860	3105020	What can I say? So that's pretty much it for my gaming week. So we will move on. Let me get into
3105020	3110140	just some quick housekeeping. We will be here next week. I know there is a Rihanna concert on
3110140	3114620	TV and some folks will be playing a football game around that. But that's never stopped us in the
3114620	3117980	past. So we'll be here next week when you're all ready to come in and join us. Or of course,
3117980	3122140	you can always listen through the podcast feed that week. So you can check that out next week,
3122140	3125500	we will be here Bobby will not be though. So if you tune in early expecting to hear Bobby,
3126380	3132220	just he will be off because that is a that is a friend friendsgiving to kind of day for Bobby. So
3132940	3137500	he takes that day off. We will not be here on February 26. I've been pretty open that I'm going
3137500	3141900	on vacation and we'll be here that week. So they're just not going to be a show that week
3141900	3148140	while my co hosts enjoy a well deserved week off. So also, I want to say just quickly here,
3148140	3153260	because I noticed this in our discord over at vog network comm slash discord, because of course,
3153260	3157660	you can join that and chat with us throughout the week. And that actually is the only place now
3157660	3161100	you're going to get updates when we go live and so forth, because I don't know if you heard,
3161100	3166060	but the Twitter API is getting yanked, or at least the free one. And let's be real,
3166060	3171100	we're not paying $100 a month to advertise our show. We don't. I mean, you guys are very generous
3171100	3176460	with the bits and subs, we appreciate you. But we're not making that kind of money to pay for
3176460	3181260	that we'd rather pay for like the legal fees to keep us you know, a legit business and so forth.
3182140	3187660	So yeah, we're not paying that API fee to just advertise when we go live in the podcast.
3187660	3193660	So if you want to see that kind of thing, join our discord vog network comm slash discord. And
3193660	3197740	if you want, you can opt out of whatever chat because we don't use the at announce thing. I
3197740	3202220	know a lot of discord use that we made a choice not to because we sometimes find that really
3202220	3207020	annoying. And if you want put a few notifications on a channel, you can turn it on. So but you can
3207020	3211660	check that out or mute a channel you don't like. Check that out. But what I did see on discord was
3211660	3218380	that it's Tiger Claws birthday today. And Tiger Claws turning 50. It's a big day. It's a big,
3218380	3222780	big day. So I just want to take a moment to say because Tiger Claws been with us for a long time.
3222780	3228220	You know, he started listening to OLR. Pretty rare. I don't know if Tiger Claws missed a week
3228860	3238220	since we started over at all games radio, which was 2008 six. I don't remember y'all. No, it was
3238220	3242860	around the time of the 2006. I think was when we started all games radio. So Tiger has been with
3242860	3247180	us pretty, pretty much ever since then every week. So I just want to say thanks for being here, Tiger
3247180	3255260	Claw. And congratulations. Yeah, he even says in chat. Yeah, 50 is a big number, but I still feel
3255260	3259580	the same. Yep. I you know what, that's how I felt about turning 40. You know, it's not that much
3259580	3268540	different than 39. It really isn't. So and no one special clarifies all games was 2006. I'm glad
3268540	3274860	y'all's brains work when mine doesn't because mine sure doesn't. So that's, that's that. Alright.
3275740	3281420	Anyway, happy birthday, Tiger Claw. Alright, let's get into some gaming news at this point. And I
3281420	3285340	will start off with this actually, especially since last week, like nothing happened. It seemed
3285340	3289900	like I mean, some things have hardly anything this week. See, it feels like the floodgates
3289900	3294540	unleashed. We had a lot going on this week. So let's get a little bit more of the same, though,
3294540	3300300	unfortunately. So more announcements of cancellations. So we have, you know,
3300300	3306220	announcements that Apex League, Apex Legends Mobile is shutting down. That apparently was
3306220	3310940	only live for about eight months and then battlefield mobile has been canceled. So
3311340	3317420	they announced that it will be shutting down Apex Legends Mobile on May 1 2023. So you got a few
3317420	3327180	months left to play that. And also, we've got so basically, they respawn had made a, you know,
3327180	3333660	one of the pictures of texts on Twitter, saying the decision does not come with ease factors
3333660	3339900	beyond our control EA probably have prevented us from maintaining the high quality experience and
3340620	3348540	content that our players deserve. As a result, the game will sunset on May 1 2023. And then
3349980	3357980	pissing off everybody. We got word that EA has canceled a joint Apex Legends and Titanfall
3357980	3362860	single player spin off game. That's a bummer. Why do you hate us like this?
3363260	3367420	Like, why? Like, Titanfall is so amazing. Like, honestly.
3368860	3374220	Yeah, that seemed like a prime opportunity. I'm I'm really surprised to hear that. I mean,
3374220	3379900	if the game wasn't up to par, then this is probably because right as my quest message
3379900	3386300	says that cancellation news hurt, which would hurt worse, this news, or that game coming out
3386300	3391100	and it being hot garbage riddled with transactions and so forth, which would hurt worse?
3391100	3397580	Which would hurt worse? I mean, the second right. So if it if it really truly was bad,
3397580	3403660	then maybe it's for the best. But I hope that idea doesn't go away. Because I think a lot of
3403660	3409180	us would like to see a team up of those two games for sure. Yeah, so apparently, according to
3409180	3414540	Bloomberg, it says a team that was worked a team of 50 developers who are working on it were formed
3414540	3419820	on Tuesday that the project had been cut. And the company would look for other positions to move the
3419820	3425900	impacted staff without and anyone without a new position would be laid off. Thank you. Yeah,
3425900	3435340	that's nice. So yeah, that's unfortunate. I would have liked to have seen that.
3437580	3438700	I think a lot of people would.
3442540	3447260	All right. Sorry, I'm I'm texting Shane to get the update. I had one more follow up question
3447260	3454140	and then I guess the answer is too many. It's always but I'm asking about that's too much
3454140	3462860	and then add like 30 more on top of that. It is too many. All right. Well, you know, we haven't
3462860	3469420	had too many years of the Xbox 360 being active because we still are lucky to have the Xbox 360
3469420	3477180	store going on. But there's some interesting signs and tea leaves going on. For 146 games
3477180	3482540	are going to be delisted from the Xbox 360 marketplace on February 7. So for those of
3482540	3487420	you listening live and if you're on the podcast on Monday, today may be your last chance to get
3487420	3494700	these games on the 360. I want to stress you can still get games on the Xbox One or the Xbox series
3494700	3499420	consoles. But these games will no longer be purchasable. I'm not going to read the entire
3499420	3506060	list. But there are some highlights including Blue Dragon, Daytona USA, you know, I got to call
3506060	3514300	that one out. Final Fight Double Impact, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, Lost Odyssey, Pagle 2,
3514300	3521100	that's a big deal. And so on the orange box. So you know that you can no longer get those games
3521100	3528940	on an Xbox 360 after February 7. So this led to the thought, you know, we've said goodbye
3528940	3534860	to the Wii storefront. And I think they threatened to pull the PS3 storefront, although I don't know
3534860	3539340	if they ever did, but pretty much the same platform. Well, they did certainly with the PSP
3539340	3545340	and the PSP Vita, right, which, you know, are all things around the same age as the Xbox 360. So
3545340	3550860	this led to the question of is the Xbox 360 marketplace just going down? And it didn't help
3550860	3558140	that apparently a Reddit user found an Xbox 360 support page that said, we encourage you to
3558140	3567100	purchase any 360 games or DLC by May 2023. But Microsoft has been quick to clarify, that was a
3567100	3574700	mistake. Oh, that's an oddly specific mistake to make, don't you think? That sounds like one of
3574700	3580060	those, was it Netflix mistakes? And I think there's another company that did the same thing.
3580860	3586620	Yeah, man, people just making all sorts of mistakes this year when it comes to policies
3586620	3591180	that people don't like. I'm gonna give Microsoft a little bit of credit here, okay? Because
3591900	3596940	the Netflix thing, that was just a fucking mistake. There's no, there's no right, you know,
3596940	3603900	there's no easy way to say that. Microsoft, at least to its credit, has done the best they can
3603900	3609420	to date with backwards compatibility. I understand some things like DDR and some other things with
3609420	3614220	licenses and other, you know, games with, you know, companies that maybe are not around anymore,
3614220	3618300	and so on and so forth. There are games people still want to be backwards compatible that are
3618300	3623980	not, and there will be games that sunset as a result of whenever the 360 marketplace closes.
3623980	3629100	But it's not like you can't go on to the Xbox Series X store and download Lost Odyssey and
3629100	3635500	still play it. And quite frankly, I thank Microsoft for reversing their stance that
3635500	3641180	they had had under Don Mattrick with backwards compatibility. Because remember, they didn't
3641180	3645100	have backwards compatibility at first. That was added later when everybody was like,
3645900	3651020	fuck you, you fuck, you fuck, and didn't buy an Xbox One. Basically, they let, they let,
3651020	3654540	they voted with their dollars. That's the more important thing. And then they turned
3654540	3657900	around and announced the backwards compatibility and have stuck pretty good with that. So I will
3657900	3665500	give Microsoft that. And I think we all know the 360 storefront on a 360's time is probably
3665500	3671740	limited. So even though Microsoft denied it and said, it's not shutting down this May,
3671740	3678220	this message was posted in error. However, what's not a rumor, those other 46 games are being
3678220	3685100	removed February 7th. So if, if you are somebody that's been waiting a while to pick up a certain
3685100	3691260	360 game that's only playable on 360, especially if it's one of these 46 titles, you probably want
3691260	3695900	to get on that. Or you're going to be forced to look for the game on disk somewhere and hopefully
3695900	3703900	not pay $120 for it like it's a copy of Widowmaker. Exactly. So because, you know, now, now the real,
3703900	3708380	you know, retro market on this stuff begins once they're no longer available digitally,
3708380	3713260	that's for sure. I want to point out something Darktitsia brought my attention to as well is
3713260	3718700	that apparently there are ways to also still download some games. So for example, there was
3718700	3725500	this tweet written by this user Ohpoorpup that says if you don't own the Xbox 360 release of
3725500	3730460	Daytona USA, which I know is the game you all care about, right? Daytona USA, but I'm assuming this
3730460	3735420	works for other games too. That is my top priority. Which is still backwards compatible. They're
3735420	3740700	going to delist it on February 7th. The game is already unpurchasable on those storefronts, but
3740700	3748540	you can still buy it on the website. So you can go to marketplace.xbox.com for $10. So you can go
3748540	3754540	get it there. So when in doubt, use the website, but that's really only going to work like today
3754540	3758620	and tomorrow. And then those, those are going to be as good as gone pretty much.
3759420	3764300	And this is exactly how Darktitsia says he got Daytona was through this. So.
3764300	3769500	All right. Before we get to our next story,
3771740	3775340	uh, I, I, uh, I texted Shane and I said,
3775340	3780220	OLR listeners want to know how many shinies, it doesn't show the phone number, right? Okay. No.
3780220	3788220	How many shinies today? And look at that played only for one hour with 31 shiny Noibat
3789180	3794060	and one random heluptile or whatever that one's called. And then I said,
3794060	3798940	what are you going to do with 31 shiny Noibats? Have them sit in my box?
3801820	3810460	Of course. And no four stars or four stars at all. Which I, I didn't get any four stars,
3810460	3816700	but I got a really good three star that's shiny. That's only, I think is a, like a 15, 14, 14,
3816780	3823420	I think. So I was very happy with that one. I actually evolved it. So, um, I don't usually,
3823420	3827100	and I, you know what, that, that is worth mentioning cause I don't usually have shiny
3827100	3832460	luck to be quite honest, but yeah, I caught this one today. So it's, it's got a pretty,
3832460	3837420	Oh no, it's, I'm sorry. It's 15, 15, 13. That's pretty good. Uh, and there it is shiny. So,
3837420	3841820	cause I already evolved it. So that's, that's my price catch of the day,
3841820	3846780	even though it's not particularly a useful Pokemon in the meta, but it's cool to have,
3846780	3852220	whatever. I'll take it. I got a lot of XL candy today and all that. So maybe that'll be one that I
3852220	3857500	end up, uh, leveling up all the way just cause I can. We'll see. All right, let's go to our next
3857500	3866940	story. Uh, Loki. All right. So in the quest for Square Enix to continually milk final fantasy seven,
3867500	3874060	they have now, you know, dedicated a day of the year to final fantasy seven, the
3874060	3883660	final fantasy seven day on January 31st. Um, so whether they do for the 26th anniversary of
3883660	3890700	final fantasy seven, they announced some things. Um, first off the final fantasy seven day so that
3890700	3897340	we can expect things in the future to forever cover final fantasy seven. Um,
3897340	3903260	there are some new playlists on Spotify that you can get for cloud and Sephiroth.
3903980	3911660	So, uh, music there, I guess. Um, my most interesting thing is power wash simulator
3911660	3917900	crossover DLC. Heck yeah. Um, they're going to be doing some stuff with that, including,
3917900	3925180	it's the Midgar special pack and, um, haven't really said too much about what's going to be
3925180	3933740	included with it, but I am excited about that. Um, so that's cool. And then they're going to do
3933740	3940220	a small Lego collab as well. Now this isn't like a Lego set coming out because I'd be really excited
3940220	3945420	about that, but no, instead this is more of, they're going to take one of four classic scenes
3945420	3949900	that they're having fans vote on right now. And then they're going to build it out Lego and I
3949900	3957260	think give it away to somebody at some point. Um, one of those being the honeybee in, so, you know,
3958860	3968220	you know what you need the vote for. Right. Um, and yeah, I guess, um, along with that,
3968220	3975340	um, no announcements of games, but, uh, need about the other stuff.
3975340	3979340	No rebirth trailer. You gotta wait for Jeff Keeley Fest to see the trailer.
3979340	3986780	Yeah. Yeah. Nothing there. Um, so I am very curious to see, uh, the power wash sim stuff
3986780	3992940	and I don't know, it says coming soon. It didn't say when, um, but it would be pretty cool.
3992940	3999580	Yeah. Well, also in the final fantasy worlds and something else I did with my gaming week,
3999580	4003260	but I left it out because I knew we were going to be talking about it here, but that is that we
4003260	4008220	actually got a demo for theater rhythm. Uh, you know, theater them final bar line is actually
4008220	4012460	going to be coming out very soon. It's out in a couple of weeks, but there was actually a live
4012460	4017100	stream that happened this week. And as part of live stream, they also released a demo. Uh, so
4017100	4023260	the demo is, is pretty darn robust. I've got to say, uh, and, uh, came out this week and I did
4023260	4028540	play the demo, uh, which has something like 30 songs in it. And, um, you can play it at various
4028540	4034860	difficulty levels. It does cap how much you can earn, but it really shows how much they intend
4034860	4039900	to let people grind in this game. You know, it's not a final fantasy game. If you can't grind out
4039900	4045980	some levels and theater them is really going to be no different. So the demo is, uh, really good
4045980	4050380	and it feels good to play on a controller. I thought it was going to be a little weird with
4050380	4055420	the whole like up and down. Cause there's certain stages where you move the reticle up and down,
4055420	4060380	depending on where the line is and so forth. But do you know what I learned? I learned a little,
4060380	4065420	I don't want to call it a cheat cause it's not really a cheat, but it's a, did you know it
4065420	4074780	doesn't matter how far up and how far down you push the, um, joystick. Just as long as when the
4074780	4081820	little dots that indicate a transition or a note hit, you are facing the, uh, the D pad the same
4081820	4086540	way that the path is about to go. So meaning if you see a dot and the path is about to go up,
4086540	4092620	you push up when the dot comes up and you hold it and it'll match. So you don't have to actually
4092620	4097260	vary the strength. So that was something I found to be a little different on that. That could be
4097260	4101740	because I was playing on basic difficulty, but I don't think that changes. I'm sure someone in chat
4101740	4105900	will correct me if I'm wrong on that. So, uh, yeah. Mike Dev says it was really sensitive in
4105900	4111420	the 3DS version. Yeah. So I liked that change too. I'm assuming it is that way, even for the hard
4111420	4116060	songs. Um, but yeah, I, I enjoyed theater them. And the interesting thing about theater them,
4116060	4120780	it's not just going to be final fantasy songs. Uh, some of the details that were confirmed
4120780	4126780	a season pass for the game with chrono trigger and chrono cross tracks. I don't see how the fuck you
4126860	4131900	announced chrono cross tracks and not have scars of time, which is one of the best video game
4131900	4136220	songs has ever been written. So that alone is going to be worth it to some people like, you
4136220	4141820	don't, you don't even say chrono cross music without that song. Like if that song is not
4141820	4149900	there, get out, get out. Although it does, it does list a song list and I don't see it. Oh,
4149900	4154220	no chrono cross scars of time. There it is. It's season pass tracks. Good. I was about ready to
4154220	4158940	lose my mind. So, um, but there's some cool stuff from chrono trigger there as well. Uh,
4158940	4163900	like robo's theme and, you know, boss battle frog C theme and all that stuff is there as well. So
4163900	4169660	that's, um, that's pretty cool. But yeah, I'm excited for the full version. I'm going to drop
4169660	4175180	a hundred dollars on it. I'm going to, but that's because they've got like 300 tracks. I love music.
4175180	4179820	I love final fantasy. This is a game for me. It probably is more that's that's like all I can
4179900	4184220	like 500 tracks or something like that. It's a lot. It's it's a lot and I'm going to play
4184220	4188140	them all and I'll probably stream that. The nice thing is too, it's, it's safe to stream.
4188140	4192620	It's all in-house music by square Enix. Um, so it will work for streaming too. So
4193260	4197900	I'm really excited about that. DJ Rama S says we need the rad racer theme as a hidden unlock.
4197900	4201580	That would be so amazing. I don't know if it'll happen, but I'd love that. That'd be cool.
4202300	4207420	Uh, entertainment says, hi, it's Rob. Rob's the problem. It's Rob. Yeah, it is. Um, that's fine,
4207420	4214140	but you know what? They, they, they act, they did something. A lot of demos have failed to
4214140	4218460	do lately. They put out a demo that made me excited for the retail release of the game.
4219100	4225260	Did Nino Cooney do that? Did Fourspoken do that? Same company even. Not really. Not,
4225260	4230220	not to most of the people I talked to. So Theatrhythm did that rare thing where they
4230220	4234060	came out with a demo that actually makes me really want to play the full game and realize,
4234060	4238300	yes, I can dump that kind of money on the game and it'll be okay for me because I love
4238300	4243660	Final Fantasy and music games. So, all right, let's move on. Loki.
4244780	4250540	All right. Uh, so this is unfortunate news for people like me who are not super thin
4251180	4257500	about the super Nintendo world at Universal Studios Hollywood. Apparently if you have over,
4258220	4263980	if you have over a 40 inch waistline, thankfully, I think I'm only 40, um,
4264860	4269660	40 inches or larger, you may not ride the ride. No Mario Kart Bowser's challenge for you.
4270300	4276540	It's only for skinny people, um, which people are getting upset about it because I don't think that
4276540	4280860	I understand like size limitations for different things and stuff like that. I wouldn't consider
4280860	4287500	myself morbidly obese. Sure. I would love to lose some weight, but like, I'm not like,
4288300	4295660	I can't fit in seats. Like that's never been an issue. Um, but apparently, yeah,
4295660	4301740	they are not letting people on the ride. They even have like a test seat, much like you would like
4301740	4306300	with a height limit and stuff like that, that they see if you fit into. And if you don't hit that
4306300	4311740	size restriction, then you can't go on the ride. And I just, I just want to confirm this is the
4311740	4319980	U S one and not the Japan one, which, you know, I just, the reality is the, you know, there aren't
4319980	4326380	as many people that are larger that go to the Japanese, you know, one day it's true. Look at
4326380	4332060	Disney sea, look at, you know, it's just, that sounds built. So this is the U S one that this
4332060	4337980	restriction is on. Correct. It is Hollywood. And apparently though, this isn't necessarily a new
4337980	4346460	thing, uh, allegedly because they have a similar, uh, physical requirements, um, requirements for
4346460	4350540	like different rides. So like playing the Hippogriff Harry Potter and the forbidden
4350540	4356620	journey, revenge of the mummy, the ride secret life of pets off the leash, all have that same
4356620	4365820	restriction. I don't know that it's, I wrote all those, right. I mean, I would say 38 was as,
4365820	4370460	you know, but, but I'm, you know, I'm tall and built different, you know, whatever. But I mean,
4370460	4375180	I don't remember those bars fitting really tight or whatever, considering that is at the upper end
4375180	4379580	of the limitations. I don't remember those bars fitting particularly tight at that time.
4380140	4386700	There's only, yeah, the only ride that I've been on recently that fit really tight on me was
4388380	4394460	the local, like kitty, uh, theme park that's nearby that has like a roller coaster map for
4394460	4399020	like kids, the dragon roller coaster, like that thing, not meant for adults even really,
4399020	4403740	but like, that was the only thing that was like, yeah, it was uncomfortably tight. I
4403740	4409020	only did it once. I was like, okay, I'm done. You know, I'm not doing this again. Um, that was about
4409020	4414620	it. Like, and that clearly is not meant for adults. I mean, like you look at it and you're
4414620	4422140	like, okay, like that makes sense. Uh, uh, ride that theme park like this, it doesn't make sense.
4422140	4427980	It's also, I feel like somewhat unwelcoming. I get it. Like, you know, you can't accommodate
4427980	4434780	literally every size of person in, in there, but like, I still think like considering like the
4434780	4439260	state of the United States and everything like that, like that's still a weird place to cut it
4439260	4442780	off. Surprising. Well in that, you know, and think about the, you know, there's a lot of people in
4442780	4447740	chat saying, well, guess I'm not going, I hope universal clarifies, you know, the ride restrictions
4447740	4451660	and so, I mean, this is really what it is. They're saying that they're working on retrofitting some
4451660	4456540	of the other rides too, to accommodate people of their own sizes. Like, I don't understand, like,
4457500	4461340	well, here's the thing, like with that one, like what looks different. So like, for example,
4461340	4468620	if you go to like Disneyland and you ride either like, say the, um, like actually any of the rides
4468620	4473740	or something, not in credit coaster, but like I was thinking more long lines of something similar
4473740	4481180	to this. So, um, toy story mania, if you ride the buzz light, you're right. If you do the, um,
4481180	4486140	I haven't written on it yet, but the, the Spiderman one, the way they're set up there is
4486140	4491740	they have got the steering wheel and everything. Um, but they also have, it's just a bench.
4492540	4498940	So like it can accommodate like, okay, if you're adult, that is maybe a little bit overweight or
4498940	4502460	whatever you can put your kid next to you or something like that. Like obviously they don't
4502460	4507100	need as much space. And so, and they just have a bar that goes down. Whereas this ride, each
4507100	4511420	individual spot has its own like harness and stuff, which I mean, you really don't need a
4511420	4517340	harness like that for this type of ride. It's not moving all that fast. It is basically like
4517340	4521900	a toy story mania type thing. Um, it just, it's set up really stupid, but.
4522860	4527180	I will just say one thing I learned about Disneyland and size on rides. When you are
4527180	4533420	standing in line for the haunted mansion and the voice says, remember no more than three to a buggy,
4533420	4538140	they do not mean three adults because I got in there with two other adults and we were all,
4538140	4542620	you know, I was, I was probably at my largest then and we were all around the same size.
4542620	4546060	Wow. I was practically sitting on their laps.
4547580	4551660	Yeah. So like, I mean, honestly, like that's the thing is like universal. It's,
4551660	4557180	it's a stretch for me even to want to go there in the first place. I would check it out. I wasn't
4557180	4563900	all that excited about super Nintendo, uh, world anyways, because just the ride didn't look that
4563900	4568140	great. And the Yoshi ride is like meant for really little kids. So it's like,
4568140	4572140	eh, there was not much for me to go see there. Yeah. And I don't want to see it when there's
4572140	4577100	a million people there and that's how it's great for the first few months, especially into summer.
4577100	4583580	So yeah, but yeah, I would be very disappointed. Like if I went and they're like, yeah, I'm sorry,
4583580	4587020	you can't go on the ride. You're too, you're too big. I'd be like, what the fuck? You know,
4587020	4593180	like I think you need my money back. That could be a really embarrassing thing for people too.
4593180	4599340	Like I, I remember years and years ago, I went to great America, which was the local, um, you know,
4599340	4603820	theme park in the Bay area. And I went with my girlfriend at the time to tell you how long ago
4603820	4609500	this was. And she was, you know, a larger gal. Um, and we tried to ride, I think the demon,
4609500	4615020	it was, which is, you know, a longstanding roller coaster. And, um, she was not able to fit in the
4615020	4619660	seat, um, because of her size and it was a very scarring incident for her and she was crying.
4619740	4624780	She was sad. It ruined her whole damn day. Um, you know, that could, you know, and, and imagine
4624780	4631660	you're really excited about super Nintendo world and you want to go and you get there and you find
4631660	4637100	this out. Like that's, that can be. And I, yeah, and I don't want to draw a
4637100	4642460	stereotype about gamers, but let's just, you know, gamers aren't always the most fit people
4642460	4648140	in the world. So like Americans too, to be honest and Americans, you added on top of it, but like,
4648140	4651500	you know, if you're talking about like Venn diagrams and stuff like that, and then you're
4651500	4656540	talking about like, you know, something that's going to attract like the gamer crowd, like,
4656540	4662460	I mean, just have some common sense, Japan, like I'm blaming Nintendo here. Cause I feel like,
4663660	4668460	I feel like this is just coming based off of what their design was in, um,
4668460	4671580	Japan. That's where my brain was going at first with this whole thing.
4671580	4679660	I don't know. It's just whatever. I mean, I, I'm probably not going to go see this thing in like
4679660	4686620	forever. Yeah. Maybe by the time I get there, all of lost weight, we can only cross our fingers.
4687180	4692220	Yeah. Uh, mission chat says they should fix it. And I hope they do because some people such as
4692220	4695900	myself, it could trigger body dysmorphia. Absolutely. That's and that's what,
4695900	4700940	that's what I experienced, you know, with my ex-girlfriend that particular day was, you know,
4700940	4706220	absolutely. Now, Hey, everybody listening to this and that reads this story that's going around.
4706220	4711580	Now we all know we better check those ride restrictions before we go to the park and
4711580	4716940	put ourselves in that situation. You know, what have you like, so that we know, but yeah, this
4716940	4721660	is, you know, that's, I there's going to be a lot of people that don't do that and it's going to
4721660	4728620	not be pretty for universal. So it's just be, be interesting. So, but yeah, check,
4728620	4732940	check the restrictions and check the updates from universal. Uh, especially when that officially
4732940	4736940	opens, I imagine they'll have all the ride restrictions actually posted online and, you
4736940	4740220	know, things still are. So they're, they could have something that maybe they're going to use
4740220	4744060	to extend some of the seat, you know, cause there are things they can do. Um, I've seen them do a
4744060	4747980	Disney and stuff like that to accommodate different, you know, uh, shapes and sizes.
4747980	4751820	So, uh, we'll see, we'll see. I don't think the book is completely closed on this yet,
4751820	4755980	but, uh, I think we all know now if we're concerned, this could be an issue.
4755980	4760860	We better check so that we don't get ourselves in a, uh, a situation that, you know,
4761740	4765580	really upsets us that, you know, being there at the park, which is supposed to be a happy place.
4765580	4771980	Right. All right. Uh, moving on. Uh, this is some good news. It makes a lot of people happy. And
4771980	4778540	that is, uh, the latest PlayStation five beta update. Uh, we'll add discord voice chat
4778540	4783100	integrated into PlayStation. We knew this has been coming for a little bit. Um, but, uh, and there
4783100	4789100	was some light discord integration on PlayStation fives, uh, last year early, uh, now voice chats
4789100	4794620	there. So if you are a PS five tester in the U S Canada or Japan, you can join a discard, uh,
4794620	4799260	dis discard discord call, uh, by the way, I don't know if you knew, but this is already available
4799260	4805260	on Xbox and Microsoft, uh, Xbox, you know, one in series X, but Sony can get it on the fun too,
4805260	4809180	which means you can talk to someone on an Xbox through your PlayStation.
4809900	4814540	Oh my God, the blasphemy. I know, I know dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria,
4814540	4821340	uh, also included with this update, a variable refresh rate for 1440 P also some dashboard UX
4821340	4826460	improvements and so forth. Um, they're saying discord integration is still a little bit clunky.
4826460	4831420	You have to link your PSN account to discord, then select discord and linked services.
4831420	4836300	And then you can complete the integration using a QR code or the integrated browser within the PS
4836300	4841100	five. But every time you want to use discord, you have to use the mobile device to transfer
4841100	4846700	your conversation. So that's a little weird still, but, um, it's all still being ironed out
4846700	4850860	and it's in beta. So maybe it won't be this bad, uh, once it gets rolling there, but we'll see,
4850860	4855180	we'll see how that goes. It'd be interesting. Yeah. I kind of agree with bonds too many steps.
4855180	4859180	So, uh, and did your, um, as once point out, you can do group group voice chats,
4859180	4864380	but not one-on-one voice chats. So, but you could call OLR through your PlayStation now,
4864380	4868700	just like you can express. Cause we take calls in the green room channel at our vog network,
4868700	4873980	discord, uh, uh, vog network.com slide. I almost forgot the URL vog network.com slash
4873980	4878700	discord. If you want to call in and maybe we'll get a call from the PS five, uh, later or next
4878700	4883020	week or something. So, um, but I think that's pretty cool. You know, a lot of people are on
4883020	4887740	discord. Uh, I just liked that whole idea that PlayStation people can talk to Xbox people.
4887740	4893820	And especially with games now being cross platform more and more, I think that's pretty cool. So
4894860	4899660	all right. Also pretty cool. A segment we do here every week, a simpler time
4899660	4905180	from what you would, you would never have imagined cross-platform play back in this day.
4905180	4906380	Let's uh, let's cue the bumper.
4916780	4922300	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4922300	4927260	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week,
4928220	4932540	but on tonight's episode, the role of dark Sakura during the classic game of the week
4932540	4937580	will be filled by Loki who has picked tonight's game. So Loki, what is the classic game of the
4937580	4943260	week? That's the game of the week is Pepsi man, because I'm not going to ever take this
4943260	4949900	assignment seriously. No, this is a good one that I could see. I could absolutely see Jamie
4949900	4954460	picking this at some point. No, it is a, it's an excellent game that was, you know,
4954460	4959420	I had never actually played this, but it's always been a favorite of mine to watch during, you know,
4959420	4965500	awesome games done quick or something like that. Uh, Pepsi man is an action game published by
4965500	4973500	kid for the PlayStation, and it was released in Japan on March 4th, 1999. And it has a
4974380	4982140	Japanese superhero mascot for Pepsi and it focuses on the player avoiding obstacles or running dashing
4982140	4986300	and jumping while Pepsi man automatically runs forward through each of the game stages.
4986300	4993180	It's kind of like a crash bandicoot type game. And, um, yeah, it's, uh, apparently a very low
4993180	5003180	budget and, uh, it featured very, uh, 3d cut scenes, um, as well as like this weird, like
5003180	5009900	live action, like, uh, video cut scenes as well. Every kind of strange, uh, Pepsi man is, uh,
5009900	5015740	consists of four stages, each divided into smaller segments, each involving the superhero Pepsi man,
5015740	5020940	saving a person who is dehydrated, such as a military man in the middle of the desert,
5021500	5026140	by giving him a can of Pepsi. The first three stages are based on real locations,
5026140	5032860	San Francisco, New York, and Texas. And the last one takes place in the unfortunately not real
5032860	5038860	Pepsi city. Uh, the game is played in a third person perspective with Pepsi man automatically
5038860	5043100	running forward through the stages, sometimes running through homes and other buildings,
5043660	5050220	taking control of Pepsi man himself, aiming to dodge obstacles and such is what the player does.
5050220	5056940	And then, um, of course there's different Pepsi branded obstacles, including a Pepsi truck and
5056940	5065420	the player, um, you know, basically gains points by collecting Pepsi cans. And it's just, it's so
5065420	5070140	ridiculous. And the theme song just will get stuck in your head. If you can hear it, cause we're
5070140	5074940	playing it here. I know that Loki doesn't hear it on the local, but, um, uh, for the podcast,
5074940	5079980	you can probably hear it as the, it's literally the same, like four notes over and over Pepsi
5079980	5088700	man. It's fantastic. Oh, we got a little end of stage jingle in there too. That's very nice.
5088700	5094220	All right. Anyway, but yeah, so that's what I had for a classic game of the week.
5094220	5099580	Um, never came out over here. Oh, let's talk about reviews. Actually for me too. I gave it
5099580	5106460	a 25 out of 40 game fan, nine out of 10, cause you know, it's worth it. Uh, gamers Republic,
5106460	5113180	a B minus planet PlayStation, 88 out of a hundred joy pad did not feel the same two out of 10.
5113180	5117980	So, um, I was going to say for the most part, those are some pretty respectable scores. That's
5117980	5126540	at least up there with sneak king. Yeah, exactly. Um, yeah, I don't know how this game came to be.
5126540	5133580	Uh, let's see here. Basically, uh, the Pepsi van is based around Pepsi's mascot of the same name,
5133580	5139100	which was created for Pepsi's Japanese branch. Uh, the character whose fictional backstory says
5139100	5143660	he used to be a scientist who transformed into a superhero after coming into contact with
5143660	5150300	holy Pepsi just featured in Japanese Pepsi commercials. And then the Japanese version
5150300	5157180	of the video game fighting vipers. Oh, crossover. Um, they also had related characters such as
5157180	5161180	lemon Pepsi man and Pepsi woman. There's a whole Pepsi verse, I guess.
5164540	5167900	Pepsi decided to promote this video game character. I'm going to tell you right now,
5168460	5175100	Pepsi, you want free advice? Pepsi man needs to come to the States. Yeah. Put them in front of
5175100	5181500	the Superbowl audience. That's going to be a hit. Exactly. And they had a sound. Do you think it's
5181500	5185580	going to do any worse than Yaris? I don't think so. What does he do? He like flicked his hand
5185580	5191340	and you suddenly saw carbonation and then it went away. I love this story here. It says, uh,
5191340	5196700	in 2019. So the game was featured in, um, you know, the anger video game nerd. Um,
5196700	5202620	and then also the soundtrack has received a vinyl release in 2020.
5204940	5208780	That's right. You can get you get Pepsi man on vinyl. You mix it in your,
5208780	5213580	mix it in your DJ sets. Oh no, no. He's running away from a giant can of Pepsi. You know,
5213580	5217740	somebody in chat had brought up because, because this was an endless runner bonds, double six
5217740	5223500	said, so temple run before temple run. I mean, kind of, I mean, the, the concept of an endless
5223500	5227500	runner is, is it particularly new? Like Pepsi man certainly didn't invent that. Like there,
5227500	5232220	if you think about it, there's games on the Atari 2,600 where stages are generated and generally,
5232220	5235820	you know, something like, I don't know, stampede maybe comes to mind where like you could, you
5235820	5240060	could, you're constantly running in one direction, doing the objective, you know, that concept has
5240060	5246380	been around for a while, but the look and feel yeah, is kind of temple runny. Yeah. But I think
5246380	5251420	the crash bandicoot is a very good, uh, um, analogy as well because that game was very big
5251420	5257980	on a PlayStation as well. So the game is so ridiculous. Yeah. It's great. All of it. All
5257980	5264060	right. Thank you. The classic game of the week. Pepsi man. Good job. Loki filling in for dark
5264060	5268060	Sakura tonight. I feel like I always pick the game, so I want to make sure you get,
5268060	5273580	you get one in once in a while. So, all right. Cool. Cool. All right. Oh yeah. Quest buster says
5273580	5278540	the Pepsi vacation of 3d world runner. Another good example of an endless runner on a much
5278540	5284620	earlier console. Good. Good. All right. Uh, we have a few more stories for you, but, uh, we will,
5284620	5288380	uh, welcome your phone calls. If anyone wants to call in tonight, we'll get there maybe in about
5288380	5293180	15 minutes after some of these other segments here over at vog network.com slash discord,
5293180	5297260	but we still have some stories for you, including some quick stories here in rapid fire news.
5297260	5303500	Loki. Yes. So here's, uh, an interesting thing. We were talking about, uh, final fantasy and Lego
5303500	5307100	stuff earlier and that they're not going to make a set. Well, that's unfortunate,
5307100	5313980	but there apparently is a set that's leaked out for, uh, the legend of Zelda. So they have a
5314620	5321340	images or promotional images that you can see, uh, the legend of Zelda, uh, Deku playset.
5321340	5328300	And of course, uh, features, uh, the Deku tree and it looks, um, pretty cool
5329180	5333740	with a mini fig Zelda or link. I think they'll actually, I don't know which characters are there
5333740	5338220	and see link. And then I think there are two different forms of link. I can tell like the
5338220	5341900	one in the blue is like breath of the wild link. And then the one in green is probably your more
5341900	5345900	classic, uh, Oh, that makes sense because of course it's been in multiple games. So,
5346460	5352700	that makes sense that it would be like that. Yeah. Um, so very cool though. Uh, I, I am
5352700	5357820	curious to see what else they're going to have coming out with it. Ooh, the X mansion. Ooh,
5357820	5364540	that'd be cool. Um, so yeah, I guess we'll have to wait and hear more about that. I know that
5364540	5372700	several different Zelda themed, um, sets have gone through as part of that whole, um, uh,
5372700	5379500	the, uh, uh, consumer design sets. They've gone through that whole process, uh, but never quite
5379500	5384380	have been voted in. Uh, so I'm curious to see if this actually, well, I mean, obviously it looks
5384380	5389260	like it's going to be a such curious to see when, but I hope we get more Zelda sets. Cause that'd be
5389260	5396620	amazing. And then, uh, we've got news regarding the, um, Nintendo. What was it? Nintendo switch
5396620	5403020	online golden eye. Um, so I meant to play those this week on the, um, cause you know,
5403020	5407820	it's on X-Box too for a rare replay basically. And I just didn't get around to it. Yeah. So
5407820	5413980	apparently we're experiencing those games. People been doing some, uh, Dean through the data and the
5413980	5422220	source code data for the Nintendo switch online release. And they found that, uh, some that
5422220	5428460	they've removed the unused data for Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. Apparently they
5428460	5434220	had originally had plans to have them in golden eye double seven, but they weren't actually in
5434220	5438780	the game. And then I think the data was in the old original version, but now they've actually
5438780	5446380	removed it. Uh, the character models from there. So yeah, neat, I guess. It's always interesting
5446380	5453500	when you see them update the old games, especially in ways that are like, not obvious. It's
5453500	5461340	interesting. Yeah. All right. Uh, some other quick news, Konami delisting a game from steam on
5461340	5466300	February 27th, the game is crime site. I'm going to be honest. I never heard of this game, which
5466300	5470780	is probably part of the problem. It is an online multiplayer only game. So once the game is
5470780	5476940	delisted and the online servers shut down on May 1st, the game will no longer be playable. In a
5476940	5481660	statement from Konami, they thanked players for playing crime site, but, uh, said basically,
5481660	5486780	uh, even though the services continue to operate with the support of many users since April, 2022,
5486780	5491980	this is less than a year old, but due to various circumstances is the official reason not knowing
5491980	5496460	what the game is. Yeah. Yeah. For example, not knowing what the hell this is. Somebody in chat
5496460	5501020	can maybe fill me in. I literally had never heard of this. Uh, you know where this goes,
5501020	5504380	the servers are getting pulled. It's done. Although the time left until the end of the
5504380	5510220	service is limited. We hope you will enjoy it to the end. No word about refunds or any of that
5510220	5518220	sort of thing. Um, quest or excuse me, orange, right? One of the people I would have thought
5518220	5522700	would know more about the game. No, not a call out, but just backing me up saying, I guess
5522700	5527980	nobody saw it. I think it was like anime clue. Well, the name kind of does sort of sound like
5527980	5535820	that. Doesn't it? So, Hmm. Anyway, in other news, uh, this is a pretty good deal in 2019.
5535820	5544300	It was Nintendo's bargain game vouchers. You spend $100 basically to buy two vouchers.
5544860	5550860	These vouchers you spend on or you cash in whatever for $60 games, but be careful
5551500	5555580	because not all of them are $60. So know what you're getting, but if you're smart about how
5555580	5564460	you spend these, you can save $10 on each. So you could actually get a voucher now and use it on
5564460	5570220	tiers of the kingdom when it's released and you would save $10. So this is only available to
5570220	5576140	switch online subscribers. Um, it is a limited catalog, which I'm going to assume is probably
5576140	5581100	mostly first party, but go in and look at the details and you also have to use them within a
5581100	5588060	year. You can't hold them forever. You also cannot buy more than eight. You do still get my Nintendo
5588060	5594060	gold points equivalent to 5% of what you pay. So, um, yeah, it's just a little perk for switch
5594060	5598940	online users, but if you know you're going to be buying the Legend of Zelda tiers of the kingdom
5598940	5603420	and like one other game this year, then it's probably a good deal. If you have the money to
5603420	5610380	drop on it right now. So check that out. All right. Well, maybe some hints of a games you
5610380	5613980	could be buying soon. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. We'll
5613980	5618700	start with the U S and what's coming out this week. Loki. Yep. Uh, not a whole lot of stuff
5618700	5625980	coming out this week. Um, we've got, looks like, uh, mercenaries, lament, silver Wolf and the seven
5625980	5633260	stars of the maiden, a really long name, uh, that's for the Nintendo switch. And of course,
5633260	5639180	Hogwarts legacy, finally making its way out on PC PlayStation five and X-Box series.
5640700	5646540	All right. Yep. That's it. Let's go over to the Nintendo switch and check out the releases there.
5646540	5652380	Uh, uh, actually I don't really see a lot of games this week cause we have tales of symphonia
5652380	5657500	remastered on the 16th, but this week we just have some additional wired controllers that are
5657500	5662860	coming out. I don't even know if these are official, but they're FIFA branded. So I guess
5662860	5666860	that's cool if you're into that, but yeah, that's it on the switch this week on the only work for
5666860	5673900	one year though. Oh, Oh, that's funny. Okay. I see what you do with that. Uh, on the PlayStation
5673900	5678940	five, uh, if you feel like Hogwarts legacy is coming out in Japan, um, just to be clear,
5678940	5684940	I'm not picking that game up. Um, I don't care for JK Rowling and her comments, you know,
5684940	5693420	that is what it is. Um, I understand there may be people out there that had Harry Potter for them,
5695020	5700540	maybe when they were in a dark period in their life. And, you know, again, like I said earlier
5700540	5706940	in the show, I don't know other people's lives. So who am I to judge, I guess, but I am just going
5706940	5711100	to say I'm not buying it. And this is the reason I'm not buying it to be very clear.
5713340	5717820	That's it. All right. Uh, but also coming out on the PlayStation five,
5717820	5722220	the Witcher three wild hunt. I probably would buy this. The complete edition is coming out
5722220	5727100	in Japan. I would buy it if it wasn't on Xbox game pass. Uh, so that is something you could look
5727100	5733660	forward to in Japan as well. Uh, that appears, I guess, a wizard boy is kind of the big release,
5734140	5738060	in Japan as well, because there's really nothing, nobody wanted to compete against it. So that's,
5738060	5742780	that's really it. But we get some big releases next week, including theater them in Japan,
5742780	5746780	as well as the rest of the world. So that's exciting. Meanwhile, how about the UK Loki?
5747340	5751660	UK is pretty much the same story. So we have Hogwarts legacy coming out there as well, PC,
5751660	5757420	PlayStation five and Xbox series. And then they're also getting the five nights at Freddy's
5757420	5764700	security breach on Xbox series. And that's it. All right. We have just a few more stories for
5764700	5769500	you, and then we're going to get to our round table via chat and discord and the mailbag
5769500	5774940	with participate at orange lounge, radio.com. Uh, but first we have some stories for you. Uh,
5774940	5780380	Loki. Yes. I really like hearing more of these stories about games being reverse engineered,
5780380	5785900	and then basically, um, getting it down to the source and allowing them to be able to put,
5785900	5792380	you put on to other consoles or in this case, PC. And now that's been done with legends of the link
5792380	5799180	to the past. So somebody has found a way to reverse engineer the game down to its code.
5799180	5805180	And they have a PC port that you can do that if you have a ROM of the game. And of course,
5805180	5812700	it has lots of different support for graphical tweaks. Um, you can even, um, do widescreen
5812700	5818860	support with it as well. And it runs great. So, uh, pretty cool to see it.
5821180	5824780	Check that out. Yeah. And you know what that means? Mods, mods, mods.
5825580	5829900	There's already been tons of mods and that stuff, but yeah, even more, even more now though.
5829900	5838460	Yeah. Yeah. And then, um, apparently, and this is going to be a surprise to no one Facebook's VR
5838460	5846380	division, not doing so great. Um, apparently they've lost $13.72 billion in 2022. I guess
5846380	5852100	that's investing in meta, you know, and working on horizon worlds and stuff like that. Uh,
5854860	5858300	how long is this going to go for? I don't know, but, um, you know, of course,
5859180	5864300	let's kind of go over what happened last year. So, you know, meta's reality lab,
5864460	5870540	they only brought in $727 million, um, in the closing months of 2022. That's
5870540	5877660	17% down from the revenue from the same period in 2021. Uh, horizon worlds has been a flop.
5878300	5885820	Um, you know, reality labs is, I guess, um, you know, the Oculus quest two has done well,
5885820	5890860	so there's at least that, um, that's a good thing. Uh, they've laid off 11,000 employees
5890860	5896700	back in November, 2022. Um, basically saying that, uh, macro economic downturn,
5896700	5903100	increased competition and add signal loss as the reason for the layoffs for that. Um,
5904540	5910380	yeah, it's, it's unfortunate, but like, I just don't think the metaverse angle is where they
5910380	5916220	need to be going with Facebook. It's, it's really like lost with what they're doing with this
5916220	5920060	because like, they're putting out, first off, they have a peripheral, like a new
5920620	5928460	meta quest pro that is supposed to be targeted towards offices, but it's like $1,500 for that
5928460	5933660	headset. And like, are people really going to strap on a headset all day long to like work
5933660	5939100	virtually? It's just, it sounds really bad. They're trying to make cases for using VR in
5939100	5943900	corporate training, like, you know, especially, um, in learning maybe how to use let's say
5943900	5948620	machinery or something or some type of process that you can actually do those things without.
5948620	5954460	Yeah. I mean, yeah, I get it too, but that, that does seem to be a rather niche kind of audience.
5954460	5957260	I don't, I don't know how many people would really be in the market for something like that.
5957260	5963020	I'm more surprised Facebook has a captive fucking audience and especially one that doesn't normally
5963020	5969180	get into games. So to speak, I'm talking about your parents are probably living on Facebook. You
5969180	5973420	know, a lot of people our age and so far are living on Facebook. I know a lot of like younger
5973420	5977020	folks seem to be shying away from Facebook, which is interesting kind of how that trends kind of
5977020	5983420	gone. But regardless, my point is all the time I've been on Facebook and I see ads for all sorts
5983420	5989980	of things. You know what? I never see ads for VR. No, that's funny is you'll see it depending on
5989980	5997180	what your interests are. So like I see VR ads all the time because I purchased VR headsets, but
5997180	6001260	that's what's so funny is I was like, they're advertising me the quest to literally when they
6001260	6006460	purchased the quest to preaching to the choir. They shouldn't be only pigeonholing that they
6006460	6012060	should be trying to market VR headset and why your parents want one. And again, I just think Facebook
6012060	6017260	is being really silly not jumping on some of the things they could do like allowing people to
6017260	6022700	create their own VR experiences and sharing them. Yeah, exactly. And it's really stupid that they
6023340	6027100	that that's how their algorithm works in the first place. Like you shouldn't be marketing the thing
6027100	6032540	that you just purchased. Like, you know that I purchased it because my accounts tied to that,
6032540	6037020	you know that I purchased those things. Like, why are you trying to still sell me it? Like,
6037020	6042460	I already have it. I need I don't need any more. Some of it's like adjacent, like they'll,
6043020	6047020	they have the different head straps or whatever you can get that has a built in battery and stuff
6047020	6050780	that's supposed to be way more comfortable and easier to put on, which that's a great
6050780	6056380	product to to try to, you know, send my way but yeah, I get a ton of ads for just like the quest
6056380	6060380	to like, Oh, hey, it's got, you know, Beat Saber and Resident Evil four. It's like,
6060380	6069020	yeah, I know that because I have one. I don't need this. It's, it's, it's really strange. But
6069020	6073420	yeah, they should do more experiences like that, like try to figure out a way to integrate it into
6073420	6078140	Facebook or something like that, where you could walk through your feed or you could see like,
6078140	6083660	somehow 3d video from people or something. I don't know, like, just something different to
6083660	6090380	do with it. Like a gallery or a show in VR, you know, or something. It's just exactly like,
6090380	6096460	take it take a page out of, you know, Fortnite or tech even Roblox at this point, like, you know,
6096460	6101820	that's how you sell like the metaverse thing like the this the cheap stuff they've been showing now
6101820	6106700	it's just like no one like no one's thinking metaverse when they purchase the quest VR,
6106700	6111340	they're thinking all the other things I can do with it like meta like meta quest or horizon.
6111820	6114860	VR is just like, yeah, whatever. Okay.
6114860	6119980	Yeah. Well, and Bobby points out, I went to an XR extended reality meetup. And I asked people
6119980	6126860	to define the metaverse for me. They described World of Warcraft and zoom. So yeah, VR kind of
6126860	6132060	has an identity problem right now. But you know what, and we've said this before. Obviously,
6132060	6136780	Facebook cannot find the magic sauce and how to market this thing. But who's already working on
6136780	6142620	it? We all know they're working on it. And when they put it on the table, it's over for you hose,
6142620	6147180	I am talking about Apple. And I don't I don't know if I've heard they may actually be doing like an
6147180	6151260	AR headset. I don't remember what the latest rate latest rumors say about Apple, but whatever it is
6151260	6157580	they're doing. They're gonna have that marketing video that shows Oh, this person can now and
6157580	6162860	people eat it up to now hold their grandkids through VR, whatever it is, like, you know,
6162860	6168140	they're gonna. Yeah, you're right. People will eat it up because but but you know what,
6168140	6175660	whether you are pro Apple, anti Apple, ambivalent Apple, wherever you are on that scale. The fact
6175660	6189660	is, Apple knows how to sell it. That very clearly, Facebook does not. But maybe once Apple starts
6189660	6195820	selling it, Facebook will pick up some hints. We'll see. It'll be too late that point. But yeah,
6196540	6204940	no. Yes, I Yeah, I can't wait for Apple to invent VR. Yeah. I guess they will. Yeah. But you know
6204940	6210460	what, once you know if you if you're the you know, you're not an Apple fan or whatever, you know
6210460	6216620	what, once they invented touchscreen phones, we got all sorts of them. It wasn't just Apple,
6216620	6220700	you can get a Google one or your other companies have a touchscreen, but you can get a Windows
6220700	6224780	phone. I'm just kidding. You can't get that anymore. But you know, it was it kind of opened
6224780	6232780	the doors for other folks to make their versions of it. So I just feel like somebody else could
6232780	6237500	come up with that message. I'm not saying only Apple can do it. I'm not saying that.
6237500	6243420	I'm just saying all signs point to we're waiting for this to happen because no one else is getting
6243420	6254380	it. And the proof is in this story that Loki just shared with us. All right. Moving right along.
6255020	6261900	Let's talk about PlayStation Plus. And the collection that's available on the PlayStation
6261900	6267740	Five, the PlayStation Plus collection, it will not be available much longer. This originally came out
6267740	6272220	in September 2020, right around the time the PlayStation Five originally launched. And if you
6272220	6277740	have an active PS Plus membership, you can get some of PlayStation's big games, not just first
6277740	6283260	party but third party stuff too. Bloodborne, God of War, Last of Us Remastered, Batman Arkham Knight,
6283260	6290460	Fallout 4, Resident Evil 7, Biohazard. Well, after May 9, the collection will be no more. You can
6290460	6295740	still claim the titles until May 9. So reminder, if you have a PS5, you might want to go do that
6295740	6300300	because once the games are associated with your account, you will continue to have access to them.
6300940	6307020	Sony says they're going to be focusing efforts on growing the PS Plus library of monthly games in
6307020	6313020	the games catalog. So they're kind of trying to redirect us towards that. But I can't help but
6313020	6319180	wonder, is PlayStation about to drop something on May 10? You know, there's been rumors of a hardware
6319180	6325580	refresh, although I guess rumor says that they're not changing the form or anything like that.
6325580	6330300	They're just going to be moving to a diskless only PlayStation but with a disk drive sold
6330300	6336700	separately type of thing. I don't see like, it's all rumor. It's all rumor. You know, we don't know
6336700	6344140	until Sony says so. So it's but it like it and like just put it this way like that is weird. I
6344140	6349180	mean, it's not weird if they do that. But like, think think about what that actually says, though,
6349180	6354860	for their their consumer partners and stuff like, yeah, I get it that they're going to have an
6354860	6359260	external disk drive, but if they're only going to be going forward with like digital only,
6361100	6366860	like, who's gonna push your console then? Yeah, like, I still never understood like,
6366860	6370940	I don't think they could fully get away from physical media. Because once again,
6370940	6375180	yeah, you'd have to sell your console direct, when you may get like target and stuff like that to
6375180	6381340	carry them, but like, they're not really incentivized to do so because they make nothing
6381340	6386860	off hardware like nothing like it's almost like you're losing money selling hardware.
6386860	6392300	So it doesn't make any sense for them to push that or even carry your product in like now you're
6392300	6397660	taking it out of GameStop or something like that. They're gonna stop pushing everything of yours
6397660	6403820	like I just that's a that's a wild, wild, stupid move. If you ask me.
6404380	6408060	I will say this, though, what's interesting about the PlayStation five, we're getting to that point
6408060	6415900	where we can pass the target test. That's two local ish stores. I mean, Folsom's a ways away
6415900	6421180	from me that have I still haven't seen that I've been stuck. I've been there and I haven't seen
6421180	6428460	them. So they're there around. So let's get to that point. So I actually ends up being a
6428460	6433260	conundrum for me personally, because I really want to get a PS five, like, you know, especially now
6433260	6436860	that theater them's on the horizon. I know it's a PS four game, but why not? We'll play it on PS
6436860	6442620	five, you know, getting the games in this collection. You know, the other PS five games
6442620	6447340	I've picked up, I don't know, I still kind of want to check out for spoken, definitely Final Fantasy
6447340	6454220	16 for me. And so I never gonna pick one up. I think it's just gonna be PC from now on, like,
6454220	6459900	because it's kind of too late at this point. And I mean, based off of how much he's max box series
6460220	6466700	which is in a box right now. I just probably am not going to pick one up.
6467980	6472460	I do your best pointing out Best Buy has the PS five got a war console bundle. Yeah. So you can
6472460	6477980	you can find them if you know where to look. We're getting to that point. So I got to figure this out
6477980	6481020	because I'm really worried I'm gonna buy one in the next week. They're gonna be like hardware
6481020	6484620	refresh. But I'm also kind of starting to go like, okay, is it the end of the world? Like if they
6484620	6488780	don't do a full out PS five mini or something is at the end of the world. And I don't know if
6488780	6493740	they're actually going to do that when they're releasing the VR to this year. That's going to
6493740	6501180	be where they're going to shift their hardware. You know, I don't know. But yeah, it's gonna be
6501180	6505580	crazy them trying to sell their VR to when no one's carrying their console because they're going
6505580	6511100	digital only. And also on top of that, like I understand, you know, once again, the need for
6511100	6518300	that type of stuff. But, you know, have they? What are they shipping them as far as digital
6518300	6524540	storage right now? I mean, is it still a terabyte? Is it half a terabyte? Like what exactly are they
6525100	6529900	including with it? Because those things fill up fast, especially with these modern games.
6531340	6535580	I don't know, I think it's too soon. I get it. Because yeah, most of the sales nowadays
6535580	6539900	are digital sales. But at the same time, the physical sales are we're keeping these game
6539900	6545260	stores alive. And you say, Oh, yeah, we're taking away from you. They're going to drop you hard. And
6545260	6550060	like, and unfortunately, those stores are where your physical your console sales are going or your
6550060	6556060	accessories. And people could buy all that stuff online. Yeah, I get that and stuff. But there's
6556060	6562380	just not a lot of incentive for retailers to sell that if they can't make up a margin somewhere.
6562380	6566220	And that margins gonna usually be games. And if you're telling them, Well, no, you don't get that
6566220	6568620	anymore. They're not going to carry your product.
6573420	6579420	I look at some chat comments over at twitch.tv slash a vog network. Zen monkey says your
6579420	6582940	PlayStation plus account is going to link to a cloud server. Well, all your games are going to
6582940	6591020	be it's over. You know, aren't we kind of moving that direction a little bit? I mean, don't we kind
6591020	6595340	of think that cloud gaming probably is going to be the future at some point. It's just we're not
6595740	6608620	quite there yet. But like in 10 years, probably. Some people will say no. But I sort of say again,
6608620	6612940	look at what Hollywood's doing. You know, they're not saying physical games will never be available.
6612940	6618300	They will just like the yo target still has a blu ray section. But the conversation early
6618300	6625260	the conversation is around Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, etc, etc, you name it.
6625820	6631820	It's all cloud based video at this point. Absolutely. The game industry will follow
6631820	6635580	the same way. Doesn't mean it's gonna be the only way but it'll be the mass way.
6636300	6641900	For sure. And like I get it like they they stores will adjust based on where you know what's
6641900	6647820	available like yeah, DVD or not even DVDs probably blu ray nowadays. At like, say a target or
6647820	6652300	something like that. It's one aisle. It's like it's small, like they don't really carry that
6652380	6656620	much anymore. And, and that's understandable because not a lot of people are purchasing
6656620	6660620	video that way. But there are still people that are doing that. And so they have that available.
6661820	6667100	Games are, you know, physical for the most part, at least a lot of people still buy physical games
6667100	6671820	for people because let's be honest, like if you're, you know, grandparents or whatever,
6671820	6677980	buying stuff for kids, their grandkids, they don't understand about like, they may do gift cards or
6677980	6681180	something like that. But they're not gonna be able to purchase like a specific game for
6681180	6687180	their kid. Because one, I don't even think there is gifting on like a lot of these digital
6687180	6694620	storefronts, at least not on Nintendo, I don't think. And it's just you can walk into target
6694620	6700220	by the cards. There's that right type of thing. But that's not but yeah, but a gift card isn't
6700220	6705900	as personal as picking out something specific for somebody. Like if you know what they want,
6705900	6710780	you're like, well, here's a gift card, here's some cash, go buy it yourself like that. It's not as
6710780	6718060	personal. I just say, I don't know, we'll see what happens. Like it could be nothing. It would
6718060	6722700	be silly, though, if they release a digital only system and then external disk drive. That just
6724700	6730140	doesn't make any sense. But I get it reduce the number of SKUs except they're not. But they
6730140	6737020	reduce seeing the main hardware down to one SKU saves Sony some money, but also, like, I don't
6737020	6744860	know. It's just silly. I can't see with a question chat saying, everyone says 10 years for
6744860	6749260	cloud gaming. But when 10 years gets here, will people actually want it? I think so. But you know
6749260	6753020	what I think the secret is there. And I've said this before on OLR, I think the key the key thing
6753020	6762380	that's missing is that you still have to be on Wi Fi. And I think when reliable 5g is in more places,
6762380	6767180	I think that's the secret thing that's missing when you can truly pick up on your phone or
6767180	6773180	tablet or Chromebook, whatever it is, and anywhere, play something or pick up, you know, whatever it
6773180	6777660	was in progress. I think that'll be the key thing. And again, I'm just gonna say look to Hollywood,
6777660	6783420	the proof is there. What was transformative for Netflix, the app, and being able to watch things
6783420	6791260	that work over over 5g, or 5g, or 4g, LTE, whatever, being able to do that. I kind of
6791260	6795340	think that is a thing. I can't see says I'm an advocate for cloud gaming. And I think you could
6795340	6800620	lower the barrier of entry, but I'm salty towards the detractors. Zen monkey 11 says I already know
6800620	6804540	I don't want it and I won't be subbed to it. You know what it's going to be though, it's going to
6804540	6810380	come back to this old adage. A system is only as good as the games that are on it. And that will
6810380	6815100	absolutely be true of the cloud gaming too. And it's absolutely true of the digital platforms as
6815100	6821660	well. Why are Showtime and Hulu now consolidating into one app? Showtime doesn't have anything.
6822380	6825500	But they have some things they don't have the things people want right now. They don't have
6825500	6829340	the Twin Peaks return thing anymore. They don't have things. So Showtime is going to merge in or
6829340	6832540	is it merging into Paramount? Sorry, I might be mixing that up. But you know what, you know what
6832540	6834540	I'm right. You're new and I'm getting to
6834540	6837340	merge the Paramount. I want to subscribe to Paramount.
6838140	6840460	Showtime is merging into Paramount if I remember right now.
6840460	6849020	We got to only subscribe to Showtime during what was it? Oh gosh, what's the show?
6850220	6854540	And just quickly before while you're thinking of that, that's a huge reason why-
6854540	6858940	Yellow jackets. That's a huge reason why Stadia didn't
6859900	6867900	move Buku units was because there was no Stadia exclusive games that everybody wanted. Yes,
6867900	6871020	they had exclusive games, but they didn't have Wii Sports.
6871820	6876460	Well, they also had the they made you purchase the games on a platform instead of just having
6876460	6880940	subscription to access all the games. There's that too. Yes. Which is different
6880940	6887020	from the Netflix and Hulu model. Yes, yes, yes. Although to be fair, but they did a really bad
6887100	6892940	job saying this towards you. To be fair, if you had that Stadia gold, you're getting enough free
6892940	6896860	games that you kind of had a big library there because they were pumping enough games through
6896860	6900700	that service where it's like the kind of you actually did kind of have that. But again,
6901500	6907260	we've said this a million times, perception is everything, right? Google never accurately or
6907900	6912700	successfully shattered that perception gamers had of what you just said, that there was a
6912700	6916460	whole library you could buy into. They just couldn't shatter that. And they didn't have the
6917100	6922860	exclusives, you know, and I don't mean literally Wii Sports. I mean, people bought a Nintendo Wii,
6922860	6926460	not because they wanted a Nintendo Wii because they wanted Nintendo Wii Sports.
6928620	6933580	That's the type. People did not buy a PlayStation 5 because they wanted a PlayStation 5. Well,
6933580	6939100	some did. I'm gonna get in trouble if I don't quantify. But what really moved that? God of War,
6939820	6946540	Horizon, Last of Us or whatever, whatever your Sony game is, that's what's moving those consoles.
6946620	6952300	Google didn't have anything at that level. They didn't invest or risk and things in that level
6952300	6959340	because they yanked that fucking studio. Like, before they didn't give it any time. We all know
6959340	6966860	that. We all know that. Anyway. All right, I am going to invite a list of roundtable questions in
6966860	6971820	our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network and phone calls if anybody's feeling up to it over
6971820	6978940	at a vog network.com slash discord. I usually will go to our email bag here to participate at
6978940	6986940	orange lounge radio.com. Unfortunately, whomp whomp, no emails this week. But I do believe
6986940	6994460	I saw a tweet that came in. And I wanted to read this tweet that was sent to us at the OLR account
6994460	6999100	and I'm gonna try to get better at this at reading these sorts of things. But Ziba actually tweeted
6999100	7004300	us this week. Hi Ziba and I hope you're well, who said, look at these games that are turning 10.
7005020	7012140	Geez. And sure enough, 2023 is a big year for these iconic games. Guess what? All of these
7012140	7018060	games are 10 years old this year. Saints Row. These these will all qualify for Classic Game of
7018060	7025740	the Week. Saints at some point this year, Saints Row 4, Grand Theft Auto 5. I'm sorry, that one is
7025740	7037020	fucking funny. Tomb Raider, The Last of Us, Pokemon X and Y, Assassin's Creed 4, Bioshock
7037020	7045660	Infinite, Pikmin 3, Super Mario 3D World, and The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds.
7046620	7050860	Super Mario 3D World is 10 years old this year and we still don't have a stinkin sequel.
7050860	7058780	What in the world? I got some DLC for the, you know, 3D World on Switch, but yeah, that's about
7058780	7063580	it. I'm just surprised they never did a true sequel to that. That's all. Thank you Ziba for
7063580	7067340	making us all feel that much older. Yes, Red Entertainment says, can you say something else
7067340	7073580	to make me feel old? I'm sure we can talk about music that's turning 40 years old this year.
7073580	7075180	It's a bunch of 80s songs.
7078940	7085180	Anyway, all right, so yes, you can always tweet us over at twitter.com slash o-l-r and sometimes
7085180	7091100	I'm good about checking that, but not always. So, I don't, I have to admit, I don't really follow
7091100	7097100	the Grammys, but I under, because I think the Grammys are whatever, but I do, you know, I can
7097100	7102300	appreciate, I guess, that video games are getting more and more of a presence at the Grammys.
7103260	7110540	Did video, I think video game stuff won a Grammy tonight, right? Um, oh yeah. Composer,
7111900	7114860	uh, hold on, I'm trying to catch up on this here. Um,
7117020	7123500	Steph Economu, I hope I said that right, won a Grammy for their work on Assassin's Creed Valhalla
7123500	7129260	Dawn of Ragnarok. That's not right. Is this, this is a, is this a parody account?
7129260	7135980	Assassin's Creed Valhalla Dawn of Ragnarok or is that, no, I'm sorry. Okay. So it's not God of War.
7135980	7140540	No, it is correct. That is the name of it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Donna Ragnarok, I think. Isn't
7140540	7146780	that, um, like DLC for it or something? Oh, that's why I got confused with God of War. Okay. I get
7146780	7154860	it. I get it. Got it. Yeah. The first Grammy award for best score soundtrack for video games.
7154860	7159020	So this was the first year that the Grammys was actually doing this award. I remember that
7159020	7166140	part. Okay. That's what it was. So, um, we also had nominated, uh, Austin Wintory for Aliens Fire
7166140	7172140	Team Elite, uh, S. Bear McCreary for Call of Duty Vanguard, Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of
7172140	7177580	the Galaxy and Christopher Tin for Old World were also nominated in this category, but it was this
7177580	7184700	DLC, uh, that they're saying in chat, um, that won, uh, the award. Well, that's, that's cool.
7184700	7186220	I guess if you follow that sort of thing.
7189100	7194620	Play this with audio if you can. All right. Is this copyright? Am I getting a copyright strike?
7195180	7198460	Hold on. Oh, this is nine seconds. All right. I'm gonna play this with audio. Sorry,
7198460	7201500	Loki. You're not gonna be able to hear this. I don't have a way to fix this, but let's, uh,
7202140	7207740	let's listen here. And the Grammy goes to
7207740	7225180	to assassins, Creed, Valaha, and the Grammy. Valaha. France. Nailed it. Nailed it.
7227740	7228860	Adele Dezime.
7228860	7236940	You know what? I should not be making fun of anyone for the,
7236940	7241740	their pronunciation live because live radio, live performance. It's a bitch.
7241740	7247020	All right. Let's just, let's just say that. Valaha. Assassin's Creed, Valaha blast.
7253260	7256380	You know what? I didn't even know that it was actually tied to a game. I didn't realize it
7256380	7260540	was DLC, but in my defense, I have never downloaded a piece of DLC for Assassin's Creed.
7260540	7265580	But I like the fact that it's, you know, getting, uh, getting the acknowledgement. That's kind of
7265580	7271820	nice. So, all right. Uh, I think that's it. I don't see any calls coming in. Oh, let me check
7271820	7275740	for last minute stories from Loki. Do you have any last minute stories? I have nothing. I've been
7275740	7280300	looking. It was a pretty busy week though. Wasn't it? A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
7280300	7283900	Oh, I mean, I guess I could talk about this. I didn't really want to mention it because I don't
7283900	7291020	play the game very much. Um, but there was stuff for, uh, the Sims four. So they, they had a,
7291020	7296540	I don't know if it was like a Sims direct or something that they did, but there is a new
7296540	7300780	update that's going to be coming out. That's adding like infants to the game, which I thought
7300780	7306140	that there already were, I guess babies just grow up to children all the way, but, uh, normally,
7306140	7310460	but, um, they're going to be adding infants to the game. And then there was also something about like,
7310460	7318380	um, what else was it? Uh, something about more, uh, trans representation. They have like, um,
7319580	7322860	upper surgery scars or something like that that you can add or different like,
7322860	7327500	you know, things for that to represent that you're going through the transition process.
7327500	7331740	I'm sorry. Was this Sims? I missed the game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Sims four. Yeah. Uh,
7331740	7338860	adds a trans inclusive top, top surgery, body scar options is what they had. Um, and then,
7339340	7345740	uh, yeah, the, uh, the baby update, which apparently was team or teased back in October
7345740	7353740	during the Sims summit. And I guess beginning March 14th, um, you will have a customization
7353740	7361420	options as allowing to, it says allowing each regret to exist on their own person or as their
7362380	7370940	own person, new hair options, clothes, and accessories. Um, they said that apparently,
7372380	7378140	let's see, they're going to be doing it like a generations pack. Uh, that's going to be along
7378140	7381980	with that. That's going to have some other things. And then Sims five is still weighs off.
7381980	7388940	That's what I see. Um, you know, uh, one of my drag King friends had that top surgery you were
7389020	7393740	referring to earlier this year. And, uh, they, they came up with a term for this that, uh, I,
7393740	7398140	I will not forget. This is their, their wording. And I think this is great. Uh, and I can't get
7398140	7401660	this out of my head. Anytime somebody mentions that type of top surgery is that they, they had
7401660	7410220	the surgery to eat the tea and they, they had their, uh, celebration after the surgery of having,
7410220	7416060	uh, uh, the tea. So, but that's neat. That's nice to have all the sorts of the representation in
7416060	7422620	there. And that speaking of games that are old, the Sims four, that is incredibly old. Yeah. So
7422620	7427820	it's, it's cool that they're still doing all those types of updates to it. So, all right.
7428780	7433580	All right. Well, uh, that's, that's it for another orange launch radio. Thank you all so much for

7481820	7487580	Okay. Um, that is, that is all I have to say. So I think we're going to go around and get everybody's
7487580	7491260	final thought tonight. So Loki, what is your final thought for the night?
7491820	7497180	I forgot to mention, I had a new episode come out of my Minecraft series last week.
7497180	7500700	So hopefully everyone's on our discord server and saw the promo for that.
7501260	7504380	Yep. I like to self promo myself all the time.
7504380	7511580	Me too. Awesome. Uh, and my final thought is, uh, I did, I did a stream this week and I'm going to
7511580	7516380	do some more this week. I really want to stream theater when that is out. So, uh, stay tuned for
7516380	7522540	that. Uh, I did want to mention one more thing. Uh, we're doing a channel 64 stream day on
7522540	7529820	Saturday. So I will be streaming at 4 PM Pacific, I believe. Yeah. 4 PM Pacific,
7529900	7533020	but we're going to be going all day. So be doing some Minecraft streaming this week.
7533020	7537820	Nice. Uh, since we're self promo-ing, I guess I should mention for any locals here in Northern
7537820	7541340	California, the Sacramento area, specifically, I actually have a double hosting weekend.
7541340	7544940	Somebody very busy this next weekend. I probably won't have a voice on next week's show,
7544940	7549580	but I'll do my best. Uh, but if you're curious Friday night, uh, I'm going to be hosting a
7549580	7555340	burlesque drag variety show called my bloody Valentine. It's called gore less. So it's burlesque,
7555340	7559420	but with a twist to it. Uh, but it's a lot of fun and everybody works very hard on their acts
7559420	7565180	and they do. They do. I, I don't want to promise there's going to be aerialism and fire and that
7565180	7568860	sort of thing, but previous shows have had that. So it wouldn't be out of character if they're
7568860	7572780	there this week. I don't know all the acts, uh, as I know who's doing it. I don't know what they're
7572780	7577020	doing, but it's a great lineup. You can check it out. Love horror events.com. That's my bloody
7577020	7582220	Valentine is going to be on Friday, uh, at the, all these shows are at the historic colonial
7582220	7586780	theater on Stockton Boulevard. And then Saturday night, the Rocky horror picture show, the cult
7586780	7592540	cinema classic on stage on screen, big crowd cast. That's been rehearsing for the last few
7592540	7596620	weeks. It's going to be a lot of fun. And I'll be hosting that as well. Saturday night, eight 30
7596620	7601740	showtime. Also the historic colonial theater. You can check out that. And a lot of events from the
7601740	7606460	group that I work with over at love horror events.com. They just announced the lineup
7606460	7612460	for sinister creature con. And I know it's not horror, but I think they know what blends the
7612460	7618140	line that the horror crowd also likes. And I will just say, so the lineup they got for, um,
7618140	7621980	sinister creature con, they actually have, they have several people. They have like cool things.
7621980	7625180	Like they have the original guy that played Michael Myers is going to be there. They have,
7625180	7629420	uh, Rachel true. Who is in the craft, but the one that cracked me up, they're going to have
7629420	7636300	Jason Muse. Uh, Brian know how a hand or whatever, Dante and Randall and Jay are all going to be
7636300	7640780	there. So people are going to be very excited about that. I'm sure. So that is coming up in
7640780	7644860	June on father's day weekend. So there's the promo for that, but I do stuff with that stuff
7644860	7650140	locally. So I don't always talk about it here on this show. Um, but just if you happen to be local
7650140	7653660	and you want to see one of those shows and don't be shy and come up and say hi, it's all well,
7653660	7658140	not during the show, but after it would be great. I always hang out after the show. So, uh, that's
7658140	7662780	it. We'll see you next week. Have a great week, everybody. Uh, take care and we'll see you next
7662780	7671420	time. Bye. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange lounge radio is a production of
