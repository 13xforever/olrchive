1
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:10,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Unity did it.

2
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:14,141
[SPEAKER_02]: They unified the mentality that Unity isn't safe to use.

3
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:18,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Unity said, trust us, we'll calculate your install fees and address fraud appropriately.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Society said, hold my beer.

5
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:22,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, Unity CEO.

6
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:27,992
[SPEAKER_02]: In your quest for more money, you guaranteed that your existing source of revenue, subscription fees from developers, is going to go down.

7
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,694
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the ongoing saga headline.

8
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:35,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you about Unity's backtrack and the rest of the week's gaming news.

9
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting right now in the show, wherever gamer has a voice,

10
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:41,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.

11
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:46,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:56,607
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again on September the 24th of 2023 with episode number 975 of our show.

13
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little multiple of 25.

14
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:01,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means 25 more to go until we hit a pretty big landmark.

15
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:02,772
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts.

16
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with you every week, along with my co-hosts.

17
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:08,256
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, hello.

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

21
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is hello and goodbye tonight.

22
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:15,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.

23
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:15,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I.

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:24,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of time before I got to light the candles, but since it's High Holy Days, our Yom Kippur starts tonight.

25
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:31,583
[SPEAKER_00]: While I am not the 100% most observant person in the world, I will not be doing any streaming.

26
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:40,786
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means most of OLR tonight, no Dead by Daylight tonight, no Dead by Daylight tomorrow.

27
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:41,106
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

28
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:45,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope... All y'all get is Disney Dreamlight Valley, and y'all like it.

29
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:49,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will I will wish you well during the holiday.

30
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:52,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it's it's more I know it's usually associated with fasting and stuff.

31
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:55,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope the holiday goes well for you.

32
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

33
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually can't fast.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,041
[SPEAKER_00]: So but you know, I'm not gonna go out.

35
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:11,765
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot that I do observe, you know, not not working not you know, I don't have automatic timers and all of my stuff like some orthodox friends of mine do but

36
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:18,170
[SPEAKER_00]: and SSJ100 Matt, an easy fast to you as well, and may you be inscribed in the book of life.

37
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,111
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

38
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:23,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

39
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:24,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

40
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:24,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Loki.

41
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:25,737
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

42
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:26,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty good.

43
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some Minecrafting going on behind you tonight.

44
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:31,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my finale.

45
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:33,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think of any other video.

46
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't done this one yet.

47
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,706
[SPEAKER_01]: A little self-promotion is always a good thing.

48
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Cough, cough, YouTube slash Loki OLR, right?

49
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:40,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

50
00:02:58,447 --> 00:02:58,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

51
00:02:58,788 --> 00:02:59,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.

52
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.

53
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,770
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

54
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get into our news tonight.

55
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,358
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, just let me know whenever you got to cut out.

56
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:09,202
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, you know, don't don't feel like you're being rude or whatever.

57
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're on a schedule.

58
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:16,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I would, you know, stay for, you know, what we've been playing, what have we been doing?

59
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,424
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sounds good.

60
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:19,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm here for a few.

61
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:23,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get there, let's talk about some of the big news that broke this week.

62
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:39,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, real quick, though, of course, a reminder, we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network, nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although Bobby Black Wolf had some other engagements tonight, and he was not able to do a show live, but he will be back next week.

63
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I think actually, I don't

64
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.

65
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's planning on next week.

66
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:46,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go ahead and say that but you can always stay tuned to his social media.

67
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:56,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was like another convention he's got his eye on and I can't manage my own calendar, let alone remember what's on his so always stay tuned to social media for the latest and greatest.

68
00:03:56,746 --> 00:04:00,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can follow him over at Bobby Blackwolf, but I believe he's planning to be here next week.

69
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into, though, what's going on in the gaming world.

70
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:06,795
[SPEAKER_01]: We do talk about video games here, and you know what?

71
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:07,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few things.

72
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, we had a pretty big show, right?

73
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:18,044
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this Unity debacle that, I mean, to say they shit the bed would be quite an understatement, right?

74
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:21,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they shitted and farted the bed last week.

75
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:25,310
[SPEAKER_01]: But that follow-up, and yes, there is more to come on that,

76
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:48,910
[SPEAKER_01]: but uh that's not even that's not even the biggest news that happened this week no no in light of all that that is not even the biggest thing that happened this week so sure enough as tends to happen we do our show sunday night put it on the podcast feed monday morning uh there won't be any big news monday morning and then uh yeah some big stuff happened on monday morning loki yeah so what happened

77
00:04:50,416 --> 00:05:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So some stuff got leaked out, some roadmaps and whatnot got leaked out from Microsoft as part of this kind of data dump that they were doing with the FTC.

78
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:13,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And come to find out, you know, there are some unredacted documents in there, including their entire roadmap talking about upcoming devices, potential games, strategy, all that stuff.

79
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:17,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all there available to look at.

80
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:23,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we know a few things that are coming down the pipeline potentially.

81
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:39,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to point out real quick, because sometimes when we get into these whole leaks and stuff, there's like this ethical question of should we talk about it because hackers found this stuff and, you know, we shouldn't, you know, maybe because it's it's questionable.

82
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:50,129
[SPEAKER_01]: This there is there is hard to ask a question of ethics with this because as I understand it, even the courts said this is not our fault.

83
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:52,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically say that say this is Microsoft's fault.

84
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,313
[SPEAKER_01]: They did something screwy when they uploaded they uploaded the wrong file.

85
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:00,014
[SPEAKER_01]: They put the square peg in the round hole.

86
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they did.

87
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:04,197
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but yeah, they did under redacted documents.

88
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything was

89
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:09,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Unredacted in there and so you can see everything.

90
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,242
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was them.

91
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:11,304
[SPEAKER_03]: This was not a leak.

92
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,024
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a leak.

93
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:14,688
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blunder of epic proportions.

94
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:16,650
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no other way to put it.

95
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,993
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not an ethical question with this.

96
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,394
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a blunder.

97
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:21,656
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out there.

98
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:22,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft's going to have to deal with it.

99
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,623
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about all the things we learned.

100
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:26,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

101
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:26,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

102
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:27,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

103
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:32,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is their roadmap, basically, from now to 2030.

104
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:38,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And it talks about a bunch of different releases that they have, different refreshes of various things.

105
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:46,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for example, right off the bat, there is a refresh of the Xbox Series X, codenamed Brooklyn.

106
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,910
[SPEAKER_03]: that is supposed to be coming down the line here.

107
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:59,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to be spherical shaped and looks like a giant like it's like one of those like Internet hotspot type things.

108
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:05,942
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the smart device that name I shouldn't say because it'll set them all off.

109
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,404
[SPEAKER_01]: But A-L-E-X-A, it looks like one of those kind of.

110
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like something like that.

111
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:13,327
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a diskless device, though, too.

112
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:16,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an Xbox Series X without a disk drive.

113
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that with it, you know, they have upgraded, you know, Wi-Fi.

114
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,414
[SPEAKER_03]: They have more storage in there.

115
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:30,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently that it's reduced the power supply power rate, like 15 percent and stuff like that.

116
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So the power draw is going to be less.

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Our chat, by the way, correcting your use of the word spherical, because that would be like a globe.

118
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,083
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cylindrical.

119
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:40,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

120
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Cylindrical, whatever, you know.

121
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:43,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It's round.

122
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:44,345
[SPEAKER_00]: It's round.

123
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:45,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Words are hard.

124
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

125
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, this isn't the PlayStation 9, you're right.

126
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't spherical.

127
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It is only... We're not quite there yet.

128
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:57,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a few more years, and it'll be fully spherical, okay?

129
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,770
[SPEAKER_00]: One day it's just gonna be an actual cloud, and it will be amorphous.

130
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you, the Xbox 360 360 will be fully spherical.

131
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now we are only 360.

132
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:09,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not full 360 360.

133
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:13,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe 360 to the power, 360?

134
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:17,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, whatever their marketing speak's gonna be for this fully circled device.

135
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:20,188
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gonna be a cloud, that's all.

136
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:21,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange writes right, the Xbox Hypercube.

137
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It is literally a cloud.

138
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,345
[SPEAKER_01]: They make it like... Roll on down to cloud gaming.

139
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:28,065
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

140
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:29,106
[SPEAKER_01]: In all seriousness though.

141
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:31,427
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the syncing screen on my Apple Watch.

142
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:37,431
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's supposed to have, they said it's going to have the same type of RAM, same specs processor wise.

143
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:41,554
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that the internal storage will be two terabytes instead of one.

144
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:50,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to support Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and of course, like I said, 15% less power draw and a USB type C port on the front.

145
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,840
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

146
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:26,328
[SPEAKER_01]: The specs will absolutely change, but what seems to be putting people off the most it seems like is the all digital element of this.

147
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Although this isn't exactly new for the industry.

148
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Sony's kind of doing the same thing with PlayStation 5, right?

149
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You can choose a diskless or disk

150
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:34,897
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.

151
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:05,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

152
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:10,568
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, Microsoft is very good with backwards compatibility.

153
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big way to do that is with your old disks in the library.

154
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:33,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So from what I understand, I think the reason probably behind this is that the Series S has done like exceptionally well as far as like they've sold, I think like three times the amount of Series S's as the Series X or it's a larger amount of that.

155
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:33,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And like,

156
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it, like, I still like the op- like, I don't own any physical disc Xbox Series X games.

157
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I like having the option available if I want to do that.

158
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:51,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I am more inclined nowadays, especially with, you know, my PC and stuff.

159
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:54,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying physical games.

160
00:10:54,359 --> 00:11:03,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that, though, still on the Switch, just because it's convenient to the Switch doesn't have a lot of storage on it, and it's convenient to be able to swap stuff like that.

161
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:10,669
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe if I had more friends with series X's or something like that, that I'm swapping games with, but I don't.

162
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's

163
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:29,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as a big deal anymore as it used to be, like, but at the same time, with that, like, I don't want it to be a landscape that's 100% digital, because if it's 100% digital, then that means that they control the price, because it's all in one marketplace.

164
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas having the disk drive available, even if you don't use it,

165
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:42,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, one, it opens the door for backwards compatibility still, for whatever limited compatibility that they have.

166
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:57,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And two, it still gives you the option, like, if this is not coming down in price discount-wise in the digital marketplace, I can still possibly get it cheaper secondhand or, you know, even on discount somewhere in a store.

167
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,540
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

168
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be helpful to know that like a disk drive attachment could be sold separately.

169
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,830
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way it's not like you're not locked into this choice forever.

170
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you were to buy one of these Xbox cylinders, and then you decide down the line, Oh, maybe I should have gotten a disk drive.

171
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,539
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's not like you're completely screwed.

172
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:13,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

173
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it would be I'm surprised we don't see more of like the disk drives.

174
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:39,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that we don't, I would rather they just have this as like a third SKU and not like, you know, maybe still have the Series X. You can get the Series X, you know, for $499 with a disk drive, or you can buy this all digital version for, you know, $499 that has a two terabyte hard drive.

175
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is more aimed at people that have a Series S.

176
00:12:44,037 --> 00:13:01,064
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get them to upgrade to a Series X. Whereas if you're in the Series S, you're like, I'm fine without a disk drive because I haven't had one yet and I've been perfectly fine enjoying my Series S. I just want to be able to play games that look a little bit better.

177
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe perhaps like

178
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:11,090
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the Series S isn't that powerful and a lot of these games are kind of maybe being held back to have compatibility with that.

179
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:22,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they just dropped the S at one point and like, okay, you got the all digital version and you have the non all digital version, but they're all going to be at that same Series X level of spec wise or something like that.

180
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:26,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's also a possibility as well.

181
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:30,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would not want to see them drop all SKUs with

182
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,441
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, okay.

183
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:51,596
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

184
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:56,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So along with that, so new console, new controller.

185
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's supposed to be a new controller that's going to be coming out.

186
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:03,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventy dollars is the estimated price point for it right now.

187
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like your typical Xbox series controller.

188
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,955
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference being, though, is it's supposed to have, I believe, motion controls in it as well.

189
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:14,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So

190
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, precision haptic feedback.

191
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:18,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

192
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to add more haptic feedback.

193
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:24,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Which the PS5 has.

194
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the things, yeah.

195
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, better haptics and an accelerometer.

196
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:39,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're kind of going the whole PlayStation route with that, or I guess Switch, whatever, kind of going that way, trying to add some of that additional haptics and accelerometer stuff in there.

197
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the buttons apparently are quieter.

198
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:48,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't notice that buttons are really loud on the controllers, but that is a thing that they have on there, apparently.

199
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:52,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thumbsticks are going to be modular, apparently.

200
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:59,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll be able to replace them with other thumbsticks in case they break.

201
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's cool.

202
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of being able to repair it.

203
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:13,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I also find this interesting this whole bullet point that's on the slide that leaked that talks about a seamless pair and switch a new mobile app where you can see paired devices in cloud and manage devices and accessories.

204
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:23,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that's interesting to me, but it is like it's almost like I mean, I guess not that we're talking about like actual controllers on phones, although like we're, you know, trying to see it.

205
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:27,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that strikes me as interesting, but it does.

206
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:27,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

207
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:29,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that's, that's neat.

208
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:30,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it sounds cool.

209
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:32,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be curious to see, you know, what that looks like.

210
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:38,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And the color scheme is kind of interesting that half white, half black, just different.

211
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:39,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.

212
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:45,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you go to the next bit here, um, I want to jump back over to DarkSakura cause I think it's about that time.

213
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:55,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So DarkSakura, before you, uh, part ways with us tonight, uh, did you have any closing thoughts or anything you wanted to quickly talk about with your gaming week or anything before we see you next time?

214
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:55,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

215
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,721
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to update Galactic Tank Force and borked it so we have a ticket open.

216
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:02,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.

217
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:13,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've watched an entire playthrough of Alien Isolation because now I'm completely obsessed with Alien for some reason right now.

218
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:17,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Play Dead by Daylight, play Live Alive, Disney Dreamlike Valley.

219
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:19,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to beat Live Alive next week.

220
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really about it.

221
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:24,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Played a lot of pinball.

222
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:27,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooked up with some friends who I haven't seen in a while.

223
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:33,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, last weekend, went through Rosh Hashanah.

224
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I made so many apple-y sweets it was not funny.

225
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,705
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm gonna go on and

226
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:44,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my candles lit and say my prayers and listen to a cool Nidra service online.

227
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:54,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all of my people out there, if you are Jewish, whether you practice or not, just, you know, if you fast, have an easy fast.

228
00:16:54,494 --> 00:16:58,796
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, enjoy your Monday, I guess.

229
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:02,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope everyone is doing well and has a sweet New Year.

230
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:10,502
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, we'll see you next week, DarkSakura, and a reminder to folks out there in less than a month at TwitchCon.

231
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:13,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at TwitchCon, I got cosplay to do.

232
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,806
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, take care, DarkSakura.

233
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:16,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, taters.

234
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:20,291
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, back to Loki talking about some of the Microsoft leaks.

235
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:25,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want to clarify also, like I think I said, 75% of the consoles sold were S's.

236
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's over 50%.

237
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:34,969
[SPEAKER_03]: But the 70% I got was 70% of full game sales on PlayStation are via digital download.

238
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:41,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is it is still something that is out available out there.

239
00:17:43,020 --> 00:18:01,484
[SPEAKER_03]: that you know there are a lot of folks purchasing stuff digitally which i mean yeah i mean like on pc like i said you know pc everything's digital nowadays um and i'm kind of okay with it like honestly the difference being though and like it isn't apples and uh apples apples here because

240
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:07,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You have multiple marketplaces on PC where there is competition.

241
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:11,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, oh, well, I want to get this game, but it's this much here.

242
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:18,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's many other sites that are reselling keys for that game that may be different prices or have different deals going on.

243
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:19,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just a walled garden.

244
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:21,236
[SPEAKER_03]: There is competition.

245
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:27,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if there was something like that on Xbox and PlayStation, I think people would be more apt to purchase digitally.

246
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But even still without that, with it just being the one marketplace,

247
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:36,415
[SPEAKER_03]: over the majority of the sales are digital, right?

248
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:43,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes sense that you would want to go in that route because it's just the way the market's going, unfortunately.

249
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks for preservation.

250
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:55,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I hope that there's still an option out there, even if it's just for like collectors and stuff, because there's still folks that are very adamant about getting physical media, right?

251
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important for, you know, collecting and all that.

252
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:04,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Other quick comments in chat, SJ100Matt says the Elite controllers have modular parts, which is a really nice feature.

253
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:09,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I've switched thumbsticks out for specific games or swapped out thumbsticks that get worn out.

254
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Also swapping out the D-pad is real nice.

255
00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:12,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a fan of the modular.

256
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:16,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never did get an Elite controller, but they they did seem pretty nice.

257
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I just it's interesting.

258
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:26,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Series X, but ever since I got my new PC, there's nothing I've really gone back to Series X for, but I still love the controller.

259
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,580
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.

260
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how I feel.

261
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:33,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

262
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:36,546
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so then what else?

263
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:46,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like aside from this cylindrical Xbox Series X, they may be also refreshing the the normal Xbox Series X as well.

264
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:52,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm seeing like it's a couple listings on their midgen devices lineup.

265
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:57,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have the Xbox Series S, Series X, Series X in XDL.

266
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:00,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that means.

267
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:04,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Xbox Universal Controller and Xbox Universal Controller and XDL.

268
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, other things.

269
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bethesda Roadmap, that was something else that was in there as well.

270
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:18,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got to see some of the games that were possibly in the pipeline.

271
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:23,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything is 100% because I think this is a roadmap from a few years ago.

272
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:29,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some things that they thought were going to come out but didn't end up coming out.

273
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:34,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the list, some of the things that kind of stood out to me, things that we know.

274
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:38,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Indiana Jones, obviously we know there's an Indiana Jones game coming.

275
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:42,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Oblivion Remaster is something that is scheduled on here as well.

276
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:46,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough, that was rumored at one point anyway, outside of this leak.

277
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:48,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is kind of interesting in a way.

278
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Starfield DLC as well is listed on there.

279
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is that a surprise?

280
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:54,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

281
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:55,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course, yeah.

282
00:20:57,213 --> 00:21:01,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Doom Year Zero and DLC.

283
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Kestrel, I'm not sure.

284
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:04,696
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of like project names on here as well.

285
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:11,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Platinum, more Elder Scrolls expansions, more Project Kestrel expansions.

286
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:15,679
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be another ongoing game.

287
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Licensed IP game.

288
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm super excited about that.

289
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Fallout 3 remaster.

290
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds cool.

291
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:24,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Dishonored 3, Ghostwire Tokyo sequel.

292
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So and I'm excited.

293
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:31,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to see what stuff they've got coming.

294
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:39,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but also very important to point out this schedule has been completely thrown off, obviously, because we see things here that are fiscal year 22.

295
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:45,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even though if that technically goes into next year, we still like it's it's still off.

296
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:46,767
[SPEAKER_01]: DLC for Starfield

297
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:14,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fire to that, you know, Elder Scrolls 4 remaster, Oblivion, those rumors like that.

298
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,445
[SPEAKER_01]: That almost seems like a sure thing now.

299
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:19,265
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's pretty exciting, I think, actually.

300
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:19,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Oblivion.

301
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

302
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:27,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they have some other documentation talking about like their cohesive hybrid compute.

303
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:35,928
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically looking at maybe possibly using ARM versus X64 architecture for CPU.

304
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:36,648
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think

305
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:51,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if they're like talking portable console with something like this, you know, when they're talking arm and stuff, that makes me think like a. Handheld device, almost be curious to see what they're doing with that.

306
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:59,769
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing, like some emails were also leaked out as part of this talking about how Microsoft had considered purchasing Nintendo.

307
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,381
[SPEAKER_01]: and BobbieD.

308
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:31,759
[SPEAKER_01]: It was around that timing on that story that we saw before was around the timing of the original Xbox because it was way back.

309
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, you know, and under a completely different leadership.

310
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:42,987
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what's interesting about quote unquote this leak, these emails or what have you, is that it shows that this still has never left

311
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:48,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft's Orbit, and the subject came up again, kind of.

312
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:48,972
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020.

313
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:54,817
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think, like gaming media, Surprise has blown this way out of proportion.

314
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:57,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

315
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Who doesn't want to buy a Nintendo?

316
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,763
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a fool if you think somebody at Sony hasn't written this exact same email.

317
00:24:02,763 --> 00:24:06,727
[SPEAKER_01]: You are absolutely a fool if you don't think Sony's written this exact same email.

318
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:16,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and it's more of, I think, that they're... I don't know if they're necessarily saying they want to purchase them, because Nintendo, they said, is sitting on a big pile of cash, they said.

319
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:23,282
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I'm talking about, like, I've had numerous conversations with the leadership team of Nintendo about tighter collaboration.

320
00:24:23,282 --> 00:24:24,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that if any U.S.

321
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:28,367
[SPEAKER_03]: company would have a chance with Nintendo, we are probably in the best position.

322
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:39,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I took it as more of like, who, who would be like the best, like the people that we could buy, like that would make us the most stronger.

323
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:43,575
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, so it was like, oh, yeah, Nintendo would be absolutely the best.

324
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:46,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Their games triple and then it was like, but it's never gonna happen.

325
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,779
[SPEAKER_01]: They're never gonna do it.

326
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,240
[SPEAKER_03]: They would never let that happen.

327
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:56,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Because first off, like if it's such like a problem to acquire acquisition or Activision right now,

328
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:58,067
[SPEAKER_03]: That would never happen.

329
00:24:58,067 --> 00:25:02,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Nintendo and Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, never would happen.

330
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:06,795
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the context of the email, if you're going like, who would be the best for us to buy?

331
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:08,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Nintendo would probably be the best.

332
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Never gonna happen.

333
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:15,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some other, and then that's where Activision Blizzard came up and then they named, somebody else was named in there too, right?

334
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:16,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.

335
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:24,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember we had that kind of conversation too, it was weeks ago about other companies that they were looking to purchase as well.

336
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:24,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

337
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,736
[SPEAKER_03]: if the whole thing didn't go through.

338
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:45,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So QuestBuster going back to the talk about the cloud gaming real quick, which is which is a good comment saying, I guess that a lot has talking about changes since the pandemic, but the broad strokes of their intentions are probably still there today, like looking towards a closer integration with Azure for their next gen console just on a new internal schedule.

339
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:51,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I would I would absolutely guess that the next round of consoles are going to lean a little more on cloud stuff.

340
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:56,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as we start to see more and more push, you know, totally digital and so forth.

341
00:25:56,674 --> 00:26:03,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I, I think absolutely we're going to see stuff that leans a little more into cloud, not necessarily a hundred percent cloud.

342
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:04,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

343
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:09,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, cause they still have, unfortunately you have internet providers that are still behind the ball there.

344
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, that's the problem.

345
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:18,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, they're holding everybody up with their stupid greed is really what it is because you know, if they just got rid of bandwidth caps,

346
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:24,581
[SPEAKER_03]: then yeah, we could full speed ahead with the cloud because that's not going to be an issue.

347
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:42,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But because they're looking to charge you as much money as possible and ever more so every day because reasons, apparently, then yeah, we're just not going to get to a point where we can stream games like that.

348
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:45,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not going to be feasible with bandwidth caps, unfortunately.

349
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:45,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

350
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:49,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, what else?

351
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:52,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else from the?

352
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:58,684
[SPEAKER_03]: The estimate is that the next Xbox console is going to be released by 2028.

353
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:16,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Already started this journey with Xbox One and Xbox One X. They said furthering it with Series S and X. We need to be more flexible in going forward with Gen 10, but also provide the ability for creators to take advantage of unique hardware capabilities.

354
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:16,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

355
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:20,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, that's feasible.

356
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.

357
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:24,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

358
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the piece about the

359
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:57,892
[SPEAKER_01]: uh like that the headline about like Baldur's Gate 3 that was going around because I got to talk about this for a minute because like it completely I don't think so it completely ticked me off I thought this was completely like misrepresented so I'm trying to I'm trying to gather my receipts right now but I'm gonna talk about this so I'm gonna I'm gonna just call it what it is like let's let's just I'm not gonna mince words here we got to talk about fucking Polygon and this headline

360
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:06,394
[SPEAKER_01]: is ridiculous and I want to talk about why and the headline is Microsoft completely misjudged Baldur's Gate 3.

361
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:13,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox dubbed Larian's Hit a second-run Stadia PC RPG before its release.

362
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:19,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you read that what is the impression that comes around that this article is going to be about?

363
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:21,239
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes it sound like

364
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:27,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody at Microsoft played this game, thinks it sucks, and called it second rate.

365
00:28:27,394 --> 00:28:31,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice, even though the headline says second run, that's not what's being implied.

366
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,240
[SPEAKER_01]: What's being implied is second rate.

367
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:45,473
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we all know that the punchline here is that Baldur's Gate 3 is a runaway success, that there are a ton of, you know, folks that are loving this game, and quite honestly, it's probably going to be a contender for Game of the Year.

368
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:50,119
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst some really heavy hitters this year, to be quite honest.

369
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Amongst your, you know, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Diablo 4, and so forth.

370
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:55,746
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what actually happened?

371
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:58,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's even in the same fucking article.

372
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you scroll that, you're looking at

373
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:05,115
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these targets for Game Pass.

374
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:06,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're talking about why they would do it.

375
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:09,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Warner Brothers and getting Lego Star Wars.

376
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:16,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we did this, it would, you know, they probably asked 35 million for it, we'd probably clock 40 million hours on it.

377
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:19,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, will PC be ready at this time?

378
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have changed at Discovery, which owns Warner, it might be.

379
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:29,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really, it's a document weighing the pros and cons of why they should bring over a certain game or not.

380
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:32,645
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Let's Sing Abba is here.

381
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't that happen?

382
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:36,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have been all over that for Game Pass.

383
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:40,151
[SPEAKER_01]: But way at the bottom here, you see Larian and Baldur's Gate 3.

384
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:43,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, second run Stadia PC RPG.

385
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:46,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Expected partner range, 5 million range.

386
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:48,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're trying to weigh the pros and cons.

387
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:51,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind, this is a dated document.

388
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Proof, they anticipated release December of 2022.

389
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:55,042
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't happen.

390
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:58,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

391
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:03,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Baldur's Gate 3 being a second-run RPG is not an opinion, folks.

392
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:05,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.

393
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.

394
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:13,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Baldur's Gate 3 was supposed to be a Stadia-exclusive RPG.

395
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:19,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Had Microsoft picked it up for Game Pass, it would have been the second run of the game.

396
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:29,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to do journalism and I don't want this is up.

397
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm sorry.

398
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know and I have friends that work in like gaming media.

399
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is shitty.

400
00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:37,665
[SPEAKER_01]: It's shitty to Microsoft.

401
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:40,927
[SPEAKER_01]: It's shitty to Larian all for clicks.

402
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:41,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck this.

403
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:53,637
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this shows, it just shows an objective ignorance to the facts that are laid on the table at the bottom of the article.

404
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:55,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a fucking break.

405
00:30:55,018 --> 00:31:00,343
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't read this website, to be quite honest.

406
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Quest Buster pointing out that Larian actually did respond to this whole thing

407
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:26,981
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty journalism website to look at the response we have over here.

408
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:31,904
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually see a tweet had come in from Cromwelp, part of the Larian team.

409
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:34,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there's that Polygon tweet.

410
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:35,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the... Oh, God.

411
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:37,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's... Sorry, I'm just so angry.

412
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:38,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the problem.

413
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:40,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the fucking problem.

414
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:44,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we live in this Twitter social media world,

415
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,281
[SPEAKER_01]: That headline became the narrative.

416
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:53,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft completely misjudged Baldur's Gate 3.

417
00:31:53,002 --> 00:32:04,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that Cromwell is not even responding to the actual facts, the actual story, but is responding to this fake headline.

418
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,886
[SPEAKER_01]: saying in their defense, so did everyone else.

419
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with DOS2.

420
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:14,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes with the genre and the way we approach things and the way we execute things.

421
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:19,349
[SPEAKER_01]: There just isn't any existing data that could have told anyone how BG3 was going to perform.

422
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:21,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had to take giant spooky leaps.

423
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,471
[SPEAKER_01]: The players didn't, but I thought that was obvious.

424
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:28,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think talking about the players didn't misjudge it, but I thought that was obvious.

425
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:31,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft didn't misjudge anything.

426
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:36,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, I'm sure somebody's gonna be like, Rob's a Microsoft fanboy.

427
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:38,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fanboy of all games, okay?

428
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:43,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a fan, and I'm also a fan of calling people out and calling things out when they're done wrong.

429
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:46,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft did not do anything wrong in this document.

430
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:58,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Polygon did, by running a fake fucking narrative against this, that anybody with a brain, especially somebody that's supposed to be versed in the games industry, could have figured out.

431
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just some idiot with a podcast and I was able to figure it out.

432
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:06,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a break.

433
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:09,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, it just it just really pissed me off.

434
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:11,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can tell but it's just it's not fair.

435
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:13,750
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair to Larry and it's not fair to Microsoft.

436
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Do better.

437
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:26,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Deft in chat says, we can make the argument of, yeah, Microsoft did misjudge Baldur's Gate 3, but that's the thing everyone did.

438
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:33,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if you want to say Microsoft misjudged Baldur's Gate by not throwing money at it and putting it on Game Pass, fine.

439
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,498
[SPEAKER_01]: But you and I both know that is not what the headline is implying.

440
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:45,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that at Mike Deft, I'm just saying that at anyone who's going to try to come after me, because I'm appropriately dragging this website through the mud.

441
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,162
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve it.

442
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:50,890
[SPEAKER_01]: MikeDef says Baldur's Gate 3 was a hit because of word of mouth.

443
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:03,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, it's that streaming and the fact that it's just a good fucking game and that they put a lot of polish on it and made sure they put in the time to make it a really fucking good game.

444
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:04,905
[SPEAKER_01]: They put in the work.

445
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:06,327
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Baldur's Gate 3 is good.

446
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,643
[SPEAKER_01]: 5thDreamInChat says, I knew it was great 3 years ago, I was just waiting for full release.

447
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:15,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's always somebody that's gotta be edgy.

448
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:16,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

449
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:20,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to be fair, also, the Baldur's Gate series has had its fans over the years.

450
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:23,051
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just been a very, very long time since Baldur's Gate 2.

451
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:25,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, out of sight, out of mind for a lot of people.

452
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:25,933
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

453
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:31,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that was like the headline that got under my skin the most in this whole thing.

454
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:33,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to call that out for a minute.

455
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, anything else you want to talk about with the Microsoft leaks?

456
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,220
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we've covered most of it.

457
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

458
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:45,863
[SPEAKER_01]: If those of you in chat wants to jump in with something, you sure can.

459
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:48,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Questbuster in chat says word of mouth and that it's Baldur's Gate.

460
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:53,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, Bioware's Baldur's Gate games are incredibly iconic.

461
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:56,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And for someone like Larian to pick it up, it hyped up a lot of fans.

462
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,789
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

463
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:58,570
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

464
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,530
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

465
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:05,273
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

466
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:06,574
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

467
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,326
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Minecraft again.

468
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:12,087
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was actually playing Minecraft.

469
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:14,228
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did this week.

470
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:19,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of it was designing my starter base, which is done now.

471
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:26,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm just building farms and have to get back into the groove of editing again.

472
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:32,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And once I have that, then I should be able to start pumping out content on a regular basis.

473
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:32,457
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

474
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:35,017
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week.

475
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:37,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a little of this, a little of that.

476
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:46,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So Diablo 4, I actually cleared the Season 1 Battle Pass, so I got all the way to Tier 90 and got the little mount that you get for clearing Tier that.

477
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:53,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yay, I've pretty much done just about everything you can do in this season besides getting a character all the way to level 100.

478
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:54,092
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be honest,

479
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:59,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of feel like now that the Battle Pass is done, I've sort of done all there is to do in the season.

480
00:35:59,614 --> 00:36:02,275
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really get anything for running a character to max level.

481
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:04,016
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not even leaderboards or anything like that.

482
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:16,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, another interesting thing in the Diablo world happened this week, and that is Diablo 3 released Season 29, which is in many ways the final season of Diablo 3.

483
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:20,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they are going to, and they've said with Diablo 3 Season 30,

484
00:36:22,703 --> 00:36:31,476
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna start to rotate through some old themes, old cosmetic, and they're basically going to start the forever pattern of just rotating through old stuff.

485
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:37,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have going on in Season 29 is the final, like, new thing that they've released into the game.

486
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:50,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is these portals that will show up randomly as you're not, not when you're in rifts, but as you're going through like the story mode parts of the game or get clearing bounties basically.

487
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:59,920
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get these rifts that take you to these like kind of very short but like uber powerful areas where you might fight like three rift bosses all at once, which happened to be at level seven.

488
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to fight three Rift bosses at level 7, but it's funny because it's all scaled to level 7.

489
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:09,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got through it, because it's the first time in Diablo 3 I'm playing a Necromancer.

490
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:16,428
[SPEAKER_01]: All these years, finally, because I played a Necromancer in Diablo 4 for the current season, I was like, yeah, I'll do a Necromancer in Diablo 3.

491
00:37:16,428 --> 00:37:17,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been playing that and

492
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:21,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I've been playing the new season, which is which is cute.

493
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:23,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably get all the way to unlocking the cosmetics.

494
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:35,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And then probably by that time, Diablo four's second season will be out, which is going to be very interesting to see how they respond to some of the negativity that's been going around about season one.

495
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel again.

496
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:46,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of the gaming press is overhyping the negativity, but I cut him a little slack on this because there are a lot of content creators, a lot of influencers out there that are like,

497
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:49,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm kind of done with Diablo 4.

498
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:50,648
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot left to do.

499
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:52,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I get it a little more.

500
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:55,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't think Diablo 4 is by any means a bad game.

501
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,351
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think there are definitely still some tweaks to be made.

502
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:03,893
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's any consolation, don't forget, Diablo 3 sucked until the expansion came out.

503
00:38:03,893 --> 00:38:06,334
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a long time for Diablo 3 to get really good.

504
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:09,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's still a lot of hope for Diablo 4.

505
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:12,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that the Season 2 will be really good as well.

506
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:25,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one other game I want to talk about, I've been playing, you know, a lot of little things like Dead by Daylight and stuff, but one other game I really want to talk about here, because I didn't talk about it on last week's show, I don't think, but I'll talk about it a little bit.

507
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:28,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about Monster Hunter Now.

508
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:38,609
[SPEAKER_01]: So Niantic, in partnership with Capcom, released their latest game called Monster Hunter Now, which is, you know, the lazy way to describe it is it's Pokemon Go with Monster Hunter.

509
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:41,671
[SPEAKER_01]: But the game mechanics are actually nothing like Pokemon Go.

510
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:45,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that both actually play on a map of the real world.

511
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:49,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have they use that same Niantic Wayfarer network.

512
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:51,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the locations carry over.

513
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:52,859
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's it.

514
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:57,782
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as like how the game operates, you know, you have monsters that spawn in the world.

515
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:03,686
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting about it is that they don't just spawn at quote unquote, Pokestops or Wayfarer locations.

516
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:06,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Monsters can spawn anywhere, which I think

517
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:23,719
[SPEAKER_01]: could be what they're trying to do to address some of the talk that their games are not fun in rural areas is it seems like they've tried to make a lot of Monster Hunter now available not tied to Pokestops.

518
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:27,622
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do visit stops, you get a lot of material and you get things there.

519
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,346
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's this interesting double edged sword.

520
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:37,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, you don't have a lot of incentive to really walk to these different locations and get stuff.

521
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess you get extra material that does come in handy for crafting.

522
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:42,114
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's really it.

523
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:46,117
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the game and the story and everything else you can kind of play out in the real world.

524
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:55,643
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be honest, like the game involves like a lot of tapping and killing monsters, but you swipe left and right, and all this stuff and back and forth to dodge monster attacks.

525
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the gag.

526
00:39:57,303 --> 00:39:58,944
[SPEAKER_01]: It runs really well.

527
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:00,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really smooth.

528
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:05,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually really satisfying to play, which shocks the hell out of me for a mobile game.

529
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:13,952
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you can even turn it on if you have a good enough iOS device or Android device, you can turn it up to like high graphics and 60 frames per second.

530
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:14,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's smooth.

531
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:21,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really like you just tap hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, you can break the head, the wing, the belly and all this stuff, just like you do in the regular games.

532
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:24,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And the combat is like extremely satisfying.

533
00:40:24,377 --> 00:40:26,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually played with other people.

534
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:30,319
[SPEAKER_01]: because I met up with some friends of mine I made through Ingress last week.

535
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,300
[SPEAKER_01]: We were getting together for some other stuff.

536
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And we decided to play a little bit of Monster Hunter now together.

537
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:42,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would scan a QR code on my phone, and then they would be in my game basically fighting the monster I was going to fight.

538
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:44,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really smooth.

539
00:40:44,263 --> 00:40:46,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of us was attacking the head, the other was attacking the tail.

540
00:40:46,983 --> 00:40:48,244
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't like skip.

541
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:49,444
[SPEAKER_01]: It ran really well.

542
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:55,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the gag is that like the game is actually very smooth and very polished.

543
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:55,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike

544
00:40:56,486 --> 00:41:02,330
[SPEAKER_01]: NBA All World, which by the way, RIP, that game shut down over the weekend.

545
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,571
[SPEAKER_01]: NBA All World is no more.

546
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:09,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And Niantic actually added a badge, their first badge in Campfire.

547
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:17,539
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever played Niantic, or excuse me, if you ever played NBA All World, you now have a legacy badge in your profile that says All World, you know, with the basketball thing.

548
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,660
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the game, it is gone.

549
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,422
[SPEAKER_01]: But the difference is in NBA All World, the game sucked.

550
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:26,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that responsive.

551
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:28,223
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't satisfying to play.

552
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:32,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It just it felt like a really subpar basketball game.

553
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:36,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And considering that was the entire backbone of NBA All World, well, you see how that went.

554
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:39,308
[SPEAKER_01]: That game lasted maybe six months.

555
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:45,271
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference with Monster Hunter is that that game is actually a lot better and a lot more fun.

556
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:49,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this game could do a lot better.

557
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:50,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

558
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:59,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of the areas where it needs like there is a story that you can do and apparently once you finish it, you can repeat it to unlock higher level monsters.

559
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:02,763
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically an endless gathering and crafting game.

560
00:42:02,763 --> 00:42:03,404
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're doing.

561
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:10,087
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gathering, you're crafting better armor, you're gathering, you're crafting better armor, which is kind of what Monster Hunter is anyway.

562
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:10,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

563
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:14,174
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two things where I'm a little worried for this game.

564
00:42:14,174 --> 00:42:19,417
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, I think it's off probably to a better start than any Niantic title I've seen to date.

565
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:26,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is that I'm not sure there's a lot of incentive to actually go out in the real world and move around.

566
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:32,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering if they're going to and maybe you know, some people rather enjoy that and complain about Pokemon Go with that.

567
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:33,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's a good thing.

568
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:33,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

569
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:35,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

570
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:53,683
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really hard to coordinate that right now and you don't really see the other players in the real world.

571
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:55,025
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really know what's going on.

572
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:58,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that still has to be fleshed out a little bit.

573
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:02,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so that that would be one of my like big, big complaints.

574
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:11,361
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is that they did their first community weekend this weekend where they put Diabolos into the game and you could kill Diabolos.

575
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:12,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it sucked.

576
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:19,496
[SPEAKER_01]: because that monster was way too hard for the game only having been out for a week.

577
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say most people maybe are unlocking three, maybe four star monsters.

578
00:43:25,923 --> 00:43:31,267
[SPEAKER_01]: The player base at large is not ready to take on five star monsters.

579
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:36,510
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell were they thinking releasing that so early as a community weekend?

580
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Does not bode well for future community engagements.

581
00:43:40,152 --> 00:43:41,813
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only concern there.

582
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:45,315
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really poorly thought out.

583
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:48,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So just going to put that there anyway.

584
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,892
[SPEAKER_01]: 5th Dream says, does your house count as camp?

585
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:56,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Will your cat cook you food now?

586
00:43:56,033 --> 00:44:01,736
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no food mechanic in the game yet, but I imagine that's one of those things the game might grow into later on.

587
00:44:01,736 --> 00:44:03,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

588
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:07,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Def says, it's funny, I have a Pokestop at my house, but I don't see it in Monster Hunter now.

589
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:08,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingress

590
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:45,645
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really need like a Wayfarer app or something that actually shows everything that exists in the network.

591
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:51,469
[SPEAKER_01]: That's supposed to be coming, but it's supposed to be coming for a long time now, that's for sure.

592
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:55,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, FitDream says, how bad are microtransactions in Monster Hunter now?

593
00:44:57,033 --> 00:45:03,699
[SPEAKER_01]: considering you get five replenishment potions in a day, it doesn't seem that bad so far.

594
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if you're going to try it, try it now.

595
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:09,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the founders pack, which gives you 500 extra inventory space.

596
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:14,989
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't felt the need to buy anything yet, which could be a bad thing if you're Niantic.

597
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:19,533
[SPEAKER_01]: But a good thing for me because I don't really want to give them money because I'm still pissed off at them for what they did to Ingress.

598
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:20,934
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is what it is.

599
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:21,055
[SPEAKER_01]: So

600
00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:24,137
[SPEAKER_01]: SG100 Matt says, I'll check out the game, I guess.

601
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:28,140
[SPEAKER_01]: My biggest issue with Pogo is I'm in a rural area and things are a bit harder to do.

602
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,682
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is more rural friendly than I might check it out.

603
00:45:30,682 --> 00:45:32,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, things spawn pretty much everywhere.

604
00:45:32,884 --> 00:45:33,224
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

605
00:45:33,224 --> 00:45:37,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane told me he's in a more rural area and he says it's still it's still not enough.

606
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:38,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't spawn enough.

607
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe it just spawns more where I am.

608
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:45,254
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't feel like you have to travel super far to find stuff.

609
00:45:45,254 --> 00:45:46,375
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.

610
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,037
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, it's free, right?

611
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,498
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you got to lose?

612
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Bandwidth.

613
00:45:52,731 --> 00:45:54,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's that.

614
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that's it for my gaming week.

615
00:45:56,774 --> 00:46:00,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are going to move on to some more stories, including

616
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:03,031
[SPEAKER_01]: our big headline from last week.

617
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:03,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

618
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:09,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so surprised to hear that somebody might have changed their minds out there, huh, Loki?

619
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:09,833
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

620
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,013
[SPEAKER_03]: They walked it back?

621
00:46:12,013 --> 00:46:15,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Never would have guessed they would have done that.

622
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:28,956
[SPEAKER_03]: No, of course, Unity came out and they outlined a bunch of different things that they were changing and basically, you know, said, here's how we're going to fix things.

623
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:29,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,

624
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:36,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Initially, they were going to, of course, do the runtime fee for everybody.

625
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:40,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But now they're limiting it to who's going to have that available.

626
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:43,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go over some of the changes that they're going to be doing now.

627
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:53,436
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, the Unity Personal plan will remain free and there will be no runtime fee for games built on Unity Personal.

628
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,497
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also increasing the cap from 100,000 to 200,000

629
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:02,469
[SPEAKER_03]: and removing the requirement to use the Made with Unity splash screen.

630
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:03,989
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty good.

631
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:13,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Also says a lot though when like people are motivated to remove the Made with Unity splash screen because there's such a negative connotation with Unity.

632
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think about that.

633
00:47:16,214 --> 00:47:22,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least now that Unity Free is, you can remove that splash screen.

634
00:47:23,303 --> 00:47:23,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

635
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:25,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you even have the splash screen at all?

636
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:29,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, honestly, if you're just giving the people the option to remove it.

637
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:31,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least you can do that now with the free version.

638
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:32,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is good.

639
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:38,667
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise, they're also making changes as well.

640
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:44,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, also, in no game, less than one million in trailing 12-month revenue will be subject to the fee.

641
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:52,850
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to make over a million dollars before you have to pay that fee in a 12-month period.

642
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise, they are also making changes as well.

643
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:06,243
[SPEAKER_03]: The runtime view will only apply beginning with the next LTS version of Unity, shipping in 2024.

644
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:13,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Your games that are currently shipped on the project you're working on will not be included unless you choose to upgrade them to this new version.

645
00:48:13,985 --> 00:48:23,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they said that the games before... One of the things that was a big contentious point was, well, how are you going to know about the installs?

646
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:25,968
[SPEAKER_03]: is it going to phone home?

647
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:29,148
[SPEAKER_03]: You say you have this proprietary algorithm that's going to do it.

648
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:31,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's all out the window now.

649
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:37,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's self-reporting your numbers like you would with, say, Unreal or something like that.

650
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:51,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So you basically self-report your numbers and you're either subject to that runtime fee or given the choice of either a 2.5% revenue share.

651
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:53,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever you want to do there.

652
00:48:54,478 --> 00:49:23,590
[SPEAKER_03]: and those numbers like I said will be self-reported from your data that you have available and you'll be billed the lesser of the amount or two amounts I guess um so yeah they significantly walk that back but that said though like even if you go into these agreements and whatnot and start billing in Unity uh with this new version or whatever that's subject to these fees nowhere did they promise that they're not going to just change the fees later on like

653
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:40,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, they did this right now, but there is nothing that they said, oh yeah, we're gonna make sure in our terms of service that we're going to not allow us to raise those fees, because yeah, they went behind everyone's back, secretly tried to take out that language that prevented them from doing this.

654
00:49:40,785 --> 00:49:47,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's a lot of trust that's been kind of burned here, and there's a lot of developers that are still not coming back to Unity.

655
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:47,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is...

656
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better than it was before, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a win, per se.

657
00:49:54,804 --> 00:50:01,869
[SPEAKER_03]: But they at least seem to have walked back stuff even prior to the announcement.

658
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:11,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Like being able to remove the splash screen and upping the revenue that you have to get to before you have to start paying for different things is good.

659
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:16,388
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's still always gonna be that, well, yeah, but you tried to screw us that one time.

660
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:20,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, probably multiple times at this point, but you tried to really screw us this one time, so...

661
00:50:22,913 --> 00:50:25,014
[SPEAKER_03]: That trust is kind of burnt, I think.

662
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:25,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

663
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:30,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's, you know, some people will still come back and go through with what they're doing.

664
00:50:30,496 --> 00:50:31,956
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I see Mish is in our chat.

665
00:50:31,956 --> 00:50:35,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mishkins, saying, did anyone forget about Silksong?

666
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:39,199
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep teasing it so much I've given up because that's also a Unity game.

667
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So that game is scrapped if Unity goes through with their BS.

668
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Team Cherry seems to be very quiet on their Twitter account and social media.

669
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:49,283
[SPEAKER_01]: So they haven't really tweeted like what the status is going through this.

670
00:50:49,703 --> 00:50:58,765
[SPEAKER_01]: But one can only kind of imagine that, well, thanks to Unity dialing back these changes a bit, they'll still go ahead and release, you know, Silksong whenever they're ready to do it.

671
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,706
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see it affecting a release like that.

672
00:51:01,706 --> 00:51:11,028
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that are maybe early on in the development of the game or what have you that maybe are thinking about pivoting somewhere else because of this.

673
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:15,389
[SPEAKER_01]: SHO100Matt in chat says the damage has been done and they can't put the genie back in the bottle now.

674
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:19,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Unity played itself and folks are already looking to get off of using it.

675
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:20,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

676
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, yeah, that is true.

677
00:51:37,265 --> 00:51:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if they're making it, if they're they're keeping their terms of service open to the fact that, yeah, we can just change the deal whenever we want.

678
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:50,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, what's to say that midway through next year when they've locked into that agreement?

679
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:51,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

680
00:51:51,229 --> 00:51:52,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

681
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:54,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, we're greedy again.

682
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:54,990
[SPEAKER_03]: We need that money.

683
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to up that that revenue share is now going to be 3.5 percent.

684
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:00,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's 4.5 percent.

685
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:02,852
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, got to keep those shareholders happy.

686
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:07,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth Dream in chat says I'm just going to use RPG Maker.

687
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

688
00:52:09,012 --> 00:52:12,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the open source one, Godot, is that how you pronounce that?

689
00:52:12,655 --> 00:52:13,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Godot?

690
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:13,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Godot?

691
00:52:13,576 --> 00:52:14,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Godot?

692
00:52:14,857 --> 00:52:17,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably had its best week ever last week.

693
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say if there's anything I would say that engine

694
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:29,029
[SPEAKER_01]: that the big headline here is you're gonna have more games being made in that engine than you were going to have a couple weeks ago.

695
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:35,130
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my takeaway from all this mess is that there's going to be people that are like, maybe we should be looking to open source to try to fix these problems.

696
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I draw an interesting similar parallel here.

697
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:43,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I granted this is a stretch, but I'm going to go with it is the same thing that's going on with Twitter.

698
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:48,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, or if you really must want to call it x, which again, we've gone over this.

699
00:52:48,754 --> 00:52:50,214
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're not calling it that ever.

700
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:51,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Sears Tower.

701
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:53,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like we're not calling Meta.

702
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:54,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Twitter.

703
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:54,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not.

704
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:56,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like it's Facebook.

705
00:52:56,057 --> 00:52:57,257
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

706
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Facebook and it's Twitter.

707
00:52:59,138 --> 00:53:00,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the thing.

708
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:09,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that Twitter is shitting the bed because of a maniacal CEO doing Lex Luthor-y types of things all over the map.

709
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:13,946
[SPEAKER_01]: A three hour show is not enough to discuss the

710
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:15,306
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

711
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:42,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is with making my parallels to Unity and open source, now you have a lot of people that are leaving Twitter, pretty much myself included, I don't post anything personal on that side anymore.

712
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:44,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use it to promote myself.

713
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:54,974
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to see things that aren't just me promoting myself, you're gonna need to go to Blue Sky, which by the way, the whole source and all that is up on GitHub.

714
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:59,455
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more open source, because the whole app protocol and everything.

715
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:06,696
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what, even if you aren't on the Blue Sky train, you're probably on the Mastodon train, which is a very similar train, open source, right?

716
00:54:06,696 --> 00:54:15,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're going to, I don't know if Pebble is open source, but you know, you're finding an alternative that is a little less corporate,

717
00:54:16,649 --> 00:54:28,611
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot more open the world owns this because what Elon Musk forgot in this whole situation is that the people have always and always will own Twitter.

718
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,541
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.

719
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:37,304
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just come in and buy that and institute your rules because the people now are building it somewhere else.

720
00:54:37,304 --> 00:54:40,006
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is they're kind of building it in four different places.

721
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:51,513
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, whenever Taylor Swift, Beyonce, whenever the AAA celebs decide where they're going to establish their presence on a non Twitter platform, it'll happen.

722
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:55,695
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's your that's going to be your winning platform guaranteed.

723
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:58,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, my point is,

724
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:08,036
[SPEAKER_01]: People already look to the open source alternatives when they realize a maniacal CEO and greed is at the helm of their faves.

725
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:09,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's happened with Unity this week.

726
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:17,361
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, let's talk about some more Xbox news.

727
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:23,628
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the Xbox news we were supposed to find out this week because Tokyo Game Show 2023.

728
00:55:23,628 --> 00:55:28,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we haven't got a ton of news out of Tokyo Game Show, but probably because of the directs that just happened.

729
00:55:28,974 --> 00:55:31,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have Xbox doing a digital direct

730
00:55:32,678 --> 00:55:35,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond talked about the importance of the Japanese market.

731
00:55:53,235 --> 00:55:54,476
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're trying.

732
00:55:54,476 --> 00:56:00,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So they talked about Hotel Barcelona, a time looping horror action game.

733
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:06,682
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a collaboration between Hidetaka Sohiro and Goichi Suda or Suda51.

734
00:56:06,682 --> 00:56:09,204
[SPEAKER_01]: That is coming out in 2024.

735
00:56:09,204 --> 00:56:13,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Octopath Traveler 2 was announced will be coming to Xbox.

736
00:56:13,566 --> 00:56:16,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.

737
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:18,889
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll get a lot of people excited with Octopath Traveler 2 coming.

738
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:26,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Forza Motorsport is getting the Hakone course and the 2020 Toyota GR Supra.

739
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's trying to show a little bit of the Japanese influence in Forza as well.

740
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:36,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Fallout 76 is getting an Atlantic City update.

741
00:56:36,504 --> 00:56:39,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure exactly what, maybe I missed something.

742
00:56:39,906 --> 00:56:42,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what that has to do specifically with Japan, but cool.

743
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:43,608
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting some updates with that.

744
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Elder Scrolls Online is coming to Japan.

745
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:49,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's a much bigger deal.

746
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:54,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan, you have to remember the MMO landscape in Japan, very different.

747
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:57,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy XIV is out in Japan and it's very popular.

748
00:56:57,652 --> 00:57:00,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what MMO is not out in Japan?

749
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:02,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Officially, legally?

750
00:57:02,673 --> 00:57:07,274
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft does not have a Japanese release.

751
00:57:07,274 --> 00:57:08,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, it doesn't exist in Japan.

752
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,595
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean people in Japan aren't playing it.

753
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,356
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no WoW in Japan, officially.

754
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:15,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So the MMO market.

755
00:57:15,234 --> 00:57:18,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's I'm not sure why they they don't.

756
00:57:18,157 --> 00:57:19,138
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?

757
00:57:19,138 --> 00:57:19,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

758
00:57:19,699 --> 00:57:20,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

759
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:22,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Food for thought.

760
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:23,243
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to get into it.

761
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:26,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft will be owning Activision Blizzard very soon.

762
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if Microsoft might change that.

763
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:28,986
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

764
00:57:28,986 --> 00:57:29,346
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

765
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:29,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

766
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:30,608
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting ahead of ourselves.

767
00:57:30,608 --> 00:57:33,931
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Elder Scrolls Online, it will be coming to Japan.

768
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:46,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So ZeniMax Online Studios mentioned that Japan will get its released fully localized on November 15th, 2023, and the Necrom expansion will come out in February.

769
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:47,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is pretty cool.

770
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are fans of this.

771
00:57:48,744 --> 00:57:52,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, the trilogy is coming to Game Pass.

772
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:55,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Althea, The Wrath of a Fury, a fantasy adventure that stars Lily and mysterious monk girlfriend Sadi.

773
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:58,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Battles and puzzles were created with both the characters in mind.

774
00:57:58,089 --> 00:58:00,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be coming to Xbox and PC.

775
00:58:17,974 --> 00:58:24,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I know lots of people are excited about Aiden Chronicle, I think I said that wrong, Aiden Chronicle, 100 Heroes.

776
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to be on Game Pass when it launches on April 24, 2024.

777
00:58:28,824 --> 00:58:32,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had another trailer that shows up to get there's a lot more coming out about this game.

778
00:58:32,648 --> 00:58:38,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some footage for Tokyo Game Show was showing up to that shows some of the early minutes of the game looks good.

779
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:39,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to play it.

780
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:39,755
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be fun.

781
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:46,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Exo Primal Season 2 is launching October 18th and there will be an update that goes with that.

782
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:52,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And a Street Fighter VI crossover, skins and emotes with Ryu, Guile, Chun-Li.

783
00:58:52,143 --> 00:58:54,145
[SPEAKER_01]: That is all happening as well.

784
00:58:54,145 --> 00:58:55,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Infinity Strash.

785
00:58:55,907 --> 00:59:04,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai is an action RPG with visuals and art from the anime and manga is what this is rooted in.

786
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:10,799
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be out on September 28 and that is coming out on Xbox, but it will also be out on PlayStation 4 and 5, Switch and PC.

787
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:17,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Pass Like A Dragon Gaiden, The Man Who Erased His Name, November 9

788
00:59:30,581 --> 00:59:34,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Monaco's Night Market also coming to Game Pass on October 26.

789
00:59:34,763 --> 00:59:39,566
[SPEAKER_01]: My Lovely Empress, the third installment of the My Lovely series coming to Xbox.

790
00:59:39,566 --> 00:59:42,007
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not saying Game Pass, but it's coming out.

791
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:45,168
[SPEAKER_01]: PAL World coming to Xbox in 2024.

792
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:48,170
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that has nothing to do with television standards.

793
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,111
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a monster collecting RPG.

794
00:59:50,111 --> 00:59:51,732
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Pokemon with guns.

795
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:55,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Party Animals, Ori, Persona 3 Reload, Persona 5 Tactica

796
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:22,357
[SPEAKER_01]: WoLong Fallen Dynasty DLC is coming out on September 27th.

797
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:25,360
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the second of three expansions.

798
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:30,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Two weapons from Lies of P are set to hit the game as crossover.

799
01:00:30,745 --> 01:00:31,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of news.

800
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:45,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I know I've been talking for a lot there, but that's a lot of news that came out of Xbox for Japan, which, you know, considering it felt like at the beginning of this cycle, Microsoft really just like wrote Japan off, you know, and I understand why, like they weren't selling there.

801
01:00:45,092 --> 01:00:48,574
[SPEAKER_01]: It really feels like Microsoft's kind of like trying to get back in.

802
01:00:48,574 --> 01:00:50,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be interesting to see how much of that works.

803
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:51,015
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.

804
01:00:52,666 --> 01:01:02,170
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100 Matt does point out Microsoft did make that big hire of Sony vet Minasato Kato to be their head in Japan in terms of partnerships.

805
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:06,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So Xbox is trying to make moves in Japan for sure.

806
01:01:06,072 --> 01:01:13,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth Dream points out there was the whole joke of Pokemon Sword, Pokemon Shield and Pokemon Gun.

807
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:15,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Pokemon Gun is real now.

808
01:01:15,136 --> 01:01:16,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on Xbox.

809
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:17,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about that?

810
01:01:17,577 --> 01:01:18,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that.

811
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:18,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway,

812
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of stuff for the Tokyo Game Show.

813
01:01:22,703 --> 01:01:24,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks good.

814
01:01:24,064 --> 01:01:24,324
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

815
01:01:24,324 --> 01:01:32,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess I kind of mentioned this one, but this this may be the last update we hear on this, because this is this is going to happen now, isn't it, Loki?

816
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:33,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

817
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So the CMA is finally

818
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:44,984
[SPEAKER_03]: approved, tentatively approved, the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft.

819
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:49,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may remember the UK's competitive market and markets and authority.

820
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:58,668
[SPEAKER_03]: They had originally rejected the deal because they said it would make them too strong in the digital cloud gaming space.

821
01:01:58,668 --> 01:02:05,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Microsoft's kind of response to that was, OK, well, we're just going to let Ubisoft control that then.

822
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:29,197
[SPEAKER_03]: in this territory and apparently that was enough for them to say all right cool you know we're cool with that um they said this is a new and substantially different deal which keeps the cloud distribution of these important games in the hands of a strong independent supplier Ubisoft rather than under the control of Microsoft

823
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:33,644
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be soft and independent in the same sentence, I hate it.

824
01:02:33,644 --> 01:02:37,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, independent in the sense, not independent in the size, independent as in the assertion.

825
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:42,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Independent of the, yeah, I get it, it's just, I hate it.

826
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:52,609
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a small independent scrappy company, you know, just making those games that the small radio towers and bandit camps have to, you know, take down.

827
01:02:53,446 --> 01:03:16,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the same thing, you know, cozy feeling every time that you pick up an Ubisoft game, you know, you know, there's gonna be radio towers, you know, there's gonna be bandit camps, you know, there's gonna be no prosecution whatsoever of sexual harassment that's going on in the company by the CEO, CEO, which is overlooking it, you know, that that's the kind of, you know, gameplay that you can expect with an Ubisoft game.

828
01:03:16,514 --> 01:03:17,574
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, there are gonna be

829
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:18,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

830
01:03:28,578 --> 01:03:35,064
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Brad Smith, we are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA's review process.

831
01:03:35,064 --> 01:03:49,759
[SPEAKER_03]: We presented solutions we believe will fully address CMA's remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work towards earning an approval prior to the October 18th deadline.

832
01:03:53,025 --> 01:04:04,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still have some more time before they finally make the actual judgment, but so far it sounds like the CMA is going to proceed with approving the deal.

833
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:07,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is one hurdle that they need to get over.

834
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:08,149
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

835
01:04:08,149 --> 01:04:08,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

836
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:13,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just going to drag this out until, you know, the 11th hour and we'll see.

837
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:16,972
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now it's looking more positive, I guess.

838
01:04:17,913 --> 01:04:24,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, SJ100 Matt in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network sums up my thoughts exactly saying so Bobby Kotek going away when?

839
01:04:24,899 --> 01:04:26,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great question.

840
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still probably going to be a little bit though, honestly.

841
01:04:28,642 --> 01:04:29,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which is unfortunate.

842
01:04:29,823 --> 01:04:33,086
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, you know, it's got the deals got to close first.

843
01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:37,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll they'll probably be a little bit of a period during transition and all that stuff.

844
01:04:38,591 --> 01:04:41,593
[SPEAKER_01]: before we really hear of him leaving.

845
01:04:41,593 --> 01:04:42,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.

846
01:04:42,053 --> 01:04:43,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope.

847
01:04:43,114 --> 01:04:47,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it'd be such a badass move if Phil Spencer fires him the day after it closes.

848
01:04:47,097 --> 01:04:55,302
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I I don't ask for much gaming God, but that is that is on the top of my that's my holiday wish list this year.

849
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:58,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil fires Bobby Kotick the day after the close.

850
01:04:58,124 --> 01:04:58,945
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I hope it happens.

851
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,570
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

852
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:04,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right before Christmas, because, you know, that's that's how those game companies do that.

853
01:05:04,793 --> 01:05:05,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, good.

854
01:05:05,954 --> 01:05:07,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of a better time.

855
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,577
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

856
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:12,919
[SPEAKER_01]: This is speaking of things I never thought would happen.

857
01:05:12,919 --> 01:05:20,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Nintendo's on the cutting edge with this technology, actually, that we're going to talk about here, because Nintendo is now doing something I don't believe.

858
01:05:20,885 --> 01:05:24,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And, Chad, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe Sony or Microsoft support this right now.

859
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:28,231
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nintendo is kind of on the cutting edge of supporting Passkey.

860
01:05:28,911 --> 01:05:36,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So Passkey, it basically allows, I mean, long story short, it allows your cell phone to kind of act as like a physical authentication device.

861
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:40,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Apple has, you know, they have Apple Passkey, they call it, but this is not limited to Apple devices.

862
01:05:40,659 --> 01:05:42,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Android has their own version of it.

863
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:57,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an iPhone with iOS 16 or newer, or an iPad, or a Mac computer with Mac OS 13 or newer, because they pretty much run the same software, or you have an Android device with Android OS 9 or later,

864
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,071
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use Nintendo Passkey.

865
01:06:01,071 --> 01:06:03,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So you register the passkey with your Nintendo account.

866
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:07,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically an extra layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access to the account.

867
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:15,975
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds that kind of physical barrier so that somebody, you know, in another country can't get into your account without that physical device, basically.

868
01:06:16,395 --> 01:06:19,997
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big reason why two factor authentication goes a long way.

869
01:06:19,997 --> 01:06:25,140
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure you've all heard of horror stories where even people get around two factor authentication.

870
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:34,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they get people to send them the key under you know, all these weird things that they do to get that phone number, you know, the phone number that type of stuff.

871
01:06:34,064 --> 01:06:38,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really like I does it function over Bluetooth?

872
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:38,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't

873
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,748
[SPEAKER_01]: But it basically like you have to have the physical device there.

874
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's connected to the Internet.

875
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:51,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it's looking it sends it to whatever the authentication server is and it's looking for response from or or no, I'm sorry.

876
01:06:51,810 --> 01:07:02,072
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's anything like it is on Google, it's basically that there's a they'll ask you to put in a password that is generated like every few seconds.

877
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:03,132
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just an authenticator.

878
01:07:04,127 --> 01:07:05,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think we're talking about here.

879
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:10,012
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think with the Apple, like because with the Paskey, it does like the scanning of your face.

880
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:14,656
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows it's you and it sends a signal basically to the device to unlock.

881
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:17,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it runs over Bluetooth.

882
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:21,502
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not super because, yeah, most of my stuff is on two factor off or this stuff.

883
01:07:21,502 --> 01:07:25,545
[SPEAKER_01]: But this sounds very interesting to me because you have to have the physical device, basically.

884
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:30,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's backups methods in case you get locked out like there always is, you know, but

885
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:36,052
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting to see the security advancing, at least on Nintendo's side with all this.

886
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:40,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I would not have pegged them to jump on this before their peers.

887
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:41,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

888
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:42,875
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

889
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:45,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Nintendo stuff, Loki.

890
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:46,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

891
01:07:46,556 --> 01:07:50,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of which, we're going to get some more rumors now of the next Switch.

892
01:07:51,817 --> 01:08:01,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, according to Activision, the rumor is that the Switch is as powerful as a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One.

893
01:08:03,048 --> 01:08:07,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we say according to Activision, we mean as part of those leaked emails, right?

894
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:10,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, as part of the leaked emails.

895
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:25,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a heavy, heavily, this was one that they actually redacted, but a heavily redacted summary labeled NG Switch Draft, standing for Next Generation Switch, was made public as part of that.

896
01:08:26,993 --> 01:08:40,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Closer to the alignment to Gen 8 platforms in terms of performance and our previous offerings on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it is reasonable to assume that we can make something compelling on the NG Switch as well.

897
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:49,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's cool if that's at that level, but, oh god, like, it seems very antiquated at this point.

898
01:08:49,484 --> 01:08:50,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know the Switch

899
01:08:51,500 --> 01:09:13,203
[SPEAKER_01]: is also like you know like xbox 360 playstation 3 levels right now but like i really wish they would catch up yeah but like if we get a new pokemon legends game even if it's like playstation 4 level stuff i'm gonna be so psyched like that's the problem their games are so good that like even running at playstation 4 level i'm gonna be into it like that's just and the fact it'll be portable it

900
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:23,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah, it's gonna and that seems to be the MO right now is that Nintendo kind of lags one gen behind but they do something really good to sweeten the pot with it.

901
01:09:23,478 --> 01:09:24,859
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

902
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:26,781
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

903
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, we'll see.

904
01:09:28,662 --> 01:09:29,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

905
01:09:29,443 --> 01:09:30,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know nothing.

906
01:09:30,324 --> 01:09:34,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing until we actually you know, because again, these leaked emails old.

907
01:09:34,247 --> 01:09:39,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't like emails that are talking about the recent look at the device at um,

908
01:09:41,201 --> 01:09:42,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic, or excuse me, Gamescom.

909
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:47,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that I was like Euro Games Fest or the Gamescom.

910
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:51,549
[SPEAKER_01]: It then the rumored behind closed doors thing these emails would be before that.

911
01:09:51,549 --> 01:09:56,192
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, who knows what Nintendo changed, optimized, etc, etc.

912
01:09:56,192 --> 01:10:01,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Behind the scenes, I would actually I would assume it's going to be a little better than a PlayStation 4.

913
01:10:01,856 --> 01:10:06,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be a little little further along than that, but it's not going to be as good as a Series X or PlayStation 5.

914
01:10:07,514 --> 01:10:08,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably not.

915
01:10:08,715 --> 01:10:13,576
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the way, you know, speaking of big games that came out, even though I didn't play it, I know a lot of people have been playing it.

916
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen a lot of the Mortal Kombat 1 stuff that's out there?

917
01:10:16,737 --> 01:10:17,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that game came out.

918
01:10:17,938 --> 01:10:24,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I've not seen the actual game too much, aside from the articles talking about the awful Switch port.

919
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:28,202
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing I've seen, you know, a lot of.

920
01:10:28,202 --> 01:10:30,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's looked... Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to talk about.

921
01:10:30,903 --> 01:10:31,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Yikes.

922
01:10:31,963 --> 01:10:58,287
[SPEAKER_01]: but no you here's the thing i think it looks hilarious like it's one of those things to me that's like so bad it's kind of good like i don't know how else to explain it like the visuals on the switch are so off especially when it's like looking at like you've seen that picture of melina i'm trying to find it uh trying to find example of the like that the picture of melina uh with like it just looks terrible it looks

923
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:05,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the one of Johnny Cage that looked really bad.

924
01:11:05,696 --> 01:11:10,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna see if I can see some...

925
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:11,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

926
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:14,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find something quickly as we're live here.

927
01:11:14,197 --> 01:11:16,499
[SPEAKER_01]: But to explain for the podcast listeners, like, yes.

928
01:11:16,499 --> 01:11:17,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

929
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:17,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.

930
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see it right here.

931
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:20,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Digital Foundry's like thumbnail.

932
01:11:20,663 --> 01:11:21,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it?

933
01:11:21,304 --> 01:11:24,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the Eurogamer has it on there.

934
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:26,828
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do the Nintendo Switch.

935
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:27,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

936
01:11:27,209 --> 01:11:27,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

937
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:35,396
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see you just you see the cartoony look of all of the like teeth and the bulging eyes and all this stuff is really funny.

938
01:11:35,396 --> 01:11:38,078
[SPEAKER_03]: The eyes like you can't tell me like I get it like

939
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:52,197
[SPEAKER_03]: that the textures have to be lower quality and stuff like that but you can't tell me you can't map like an eyeball it's it's literally a sphere it's not like a ton of stuff you can't do it correctly like i just have a hard time believing that

940
01:11:54,351 --> 01:12:07,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to find there was a really funny picture that I had seen that I had posted that it was so bad it like made me feel like it was an ad for the game.

941
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:12,516
[SPEAKER_01]: He said now I can't find it because I thought I had posted on my blue sky where I was like this looks so bad.

942
01:12:12,516 --> 01:12:16,077
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of good.

943
01:12:16,077 --> 01:12:16,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang it.

944
01:12:16,477 --> 01:12:18,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find it now.

945
01:12:18,177 --> 01:12:19,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's like artwork.

946
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:21,695
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

947
01:12:21,695 --> 01:12:22,256
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

948
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:30,602
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it shows actually like the buggy eyes on Johnny Cage and like the horrible face and the teeth on Mileena.

949
01:12:30,602 --> 01:12:37,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the joke, because I found this in Star Trek shitposting, the joke is the Klingon with the eyes budging out of the head saying, why is everyone looking at me?

950
01:12:37,908 --> 01:12:39,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it looks like that.

951
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:40,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And it cracked me up.

952
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:42,432
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

953
01:12:42,432 --> 01:12:44,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I would share.

954
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,534
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

955
01:12:45,534 --> 01:12:50,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's go back to a time when we expected bad graphics in this segment.

956
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:08,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

957
01:13:08,139 --> 01:13:10,142
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of... On the DI.

958
01:13:13,377 --> 01:13:19,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about the audio that snuck in there, bringing up a YouTube show of the classic game for tonight.

959
01:13:19,179 --> 01:13:22,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And tonight's classic game is going to be a little bit different.

960
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:28,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you that are watching on the feed, the best I could find was somebody reviewing the game.

961
01:13:28,463 --> 01:13:32,104
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't like it kind of comes through a little wonky in the video.

962
01:13:32,104 --> 01:13:35,845
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to be talking about a game that I have picked tonight.

963
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:42,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone back to my classic BBS days and I've picked a door game called The Pit.

964
01:13:43,839 --> 01:13:48,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I wonder how many of you out there ever played this BBS door game, The Pit.

965
01:13:48,881 --> 01:13:51,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, did you ever play this?

966
01:13:51,903 --> 01:13:52,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you might.

967
01:13:52,283 --> 01:13:58,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't, but I know, um, you know, kind of like see, I know, like how it worked, right?

968
01:13:58,926 --> 01:13:59,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

969
01:13:59,546 --> 01:14:07,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a BBS door game, you would log in and you the concept was you were being thrown into this pit where you would battle monsters

970
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,352
[SPEAKER_01]: or other players.

971
01:14:09,352 --> 01:14:11,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in this particular video we're watching right now the player is battling a thief

972
01:14:31,011 --> 01:14:34,014
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can like fire a ranged weapon or use an attack weapon.

973
01:14:34,014 --> 01:14:36,296
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very, very basic sort of game.

974
01:14:36,296 --> 01:14:42,522
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it was played through a bulletin board system, you called into this with your modem to be able to play this game.

975
01:14:42,522 --> 01:14:46,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was essentially a very early type of multiplayer game.

976
01:14:46,005 --> 01:14:52,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember playing a shit ton of this when I was younger, like around, you know, 14, 15 and calling into BBSs all the time.

977
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:58,973
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pit was created by James Berry of Midas Touch Software in 1990.

978
01:14:58,973 --> 01:15:02,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting fact I found out doing research for this tonight.

979
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:04,415
[SPEAKER_01]: He passed away in 1999.

980
01:15:04,415 --> 01:15:05,215
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very sad.

981
01:15:05,215 --> 01:15:06,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea.

982
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:11,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we never heard about, oh, what did that guy move on to doing on and so forth is unfortunately, he passed away at the end of the 90s.

983
01:15:11,877 --> 01:15:11,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So

984
01:15:13,657 --> 01:15:21,403
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was obviously a huge legacy of his, was creating this game which was transformative for BBS Games.

985
01:15:21,403 --> 01:15:27,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically in the game you play as what is considered a lowly farm boy who is seeking fortune.

986
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:32,813
[SPEAKER_01]: You start with basic armor, basic sword, like a loincloth and a wooden sword, right?

987
01:15:32,813 --> 01:15:41,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you win, you get stronger, you can get better weapons, you power up, and then at some point you're taken on like Odin and Thor in the pit.

988
01:15:42,506 --> 01:15:45,729
[SPEAKER_01]: or, of course, you can battle other people.

989
01:15:45,729 --> 01:15:52,594
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get somebody who's too powerful, you can try begging for mercy so that you don't lose anything when you get eliminated or whatever.

990
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:58,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was a BBS store game, you got a limited number of play sessions per day, usually three.

991
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:08,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And then either you die, so it kicks you out of the game for the day, that was how it ended, or the session timer expired because you could actually limit how long on a BBS people could actually play the games for.

992
01:16:08,347 --> 01:16:09,108
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big thing.

993
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:12,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the other kicker.

994
01:16:12,673 --> 01:16:20,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's funny about this, yeah, Questbuster says, wow, it looks like an early roguelike from the early 80s in some ways, probably because of the ASCII graphics, right?

995
01:16:20,478 --> 01:16:23,961
[SPEAKER_01]: The really rudimentary graphics system in the game.

996
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:30,485
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the punchline I wanted to get to with my selection tonight and why I thought this was even more awesome.

997
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:35,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is because there was actually a full front-end client.

998
01:16:35,889 --> 01:16:43,672
[SPEAKER_01]: a separate program you could launch while you were on the BBS that would up the graphics of the game.

999
01:16:43,672 --> 01:16:48,174
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the Pit Terminal or EGA Terminal Interface.

1000
01:16:48,174 --> 01:16:55,177
[SPEAKER_01]: You would get art created by D. Greg Hargrove, EGA graphics, MIDI music, and sound effects.

1001
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:59,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was like playing an early, early game online.

1002
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, remember, this was like

1003
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,206
[SPEAKER_01]: God, pretty early on in the 90s you were playing this and it looked incredible for the time.

1004
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:14,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pause the video and for those of you that are watching on Twitch, all I've got to show this, I looked everywhere for video of this and I could not find it.

1005
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:16,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I could only find some graphics.

1006
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:26,064
[SPEAKER_01]: to show you the comparison between those ASCII graphics that you saw in the clip and some actually like, oh, you know, EGA was like 16 colors on the screen at once.

1007
01:17:26,064 --> 01:17:31,308
[SPEAKER_01]: It was maybe, maybe the quality of like NES graphics or like

1008
01:17:32,475 --> 01:17:37,879
[SPEAKER_01]: like a Commodore 64 or something like it wasn't great, but it was still actually 1995.

1009
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:40,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks odd is when the pit terminal came out.

1010
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:53,892
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, I mean, compared to what you were seeing in the video, which is the ASCII graphics, to be able to see like these full on depictions of slot machines or a poker table and see things in an interface that was really designed for the game was really

1011
01:17:54,312 --> 01:17:56,353
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1012
01:18:15,138 --> 01:18:16,099
[SPEAKER_01]: played this a lot.

1013
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:28,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I would call into BBSs here locally, log in, get my rounds in for the day, try to strengthen my character, maybe pick on somebody else if I thought I was strong enough, because I thought I was badass, and do that.

1014
01:18:28,648 --> 01:18:37,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the BBS Dwarf Game era is kind of a forgotten one, and it's unfortunate because we had a few really good years playing that.

1015
01:18:37,655 --> 01:18:39,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised they haven't done like a

1016
01:18:40,795 --> 01:18:44,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Emulator of sorts like collection and release on PC where you can play all that stuff.

1017
01:18:59,764 --> 01:19:21,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Bobby and I talked about this a long time ago where like we could actually if we wanted to set up like a VOG Network BBS and people could actually play door games on it but we're kind of sitting here going would the juice be worth the squeeze if we would do the efforts to set something like that up would people actually use it and it kind of keeps coming back to no but if y'all want to try to change our minds

1018
01:19:22,574 --> 01:19:26,497
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means, I loved BBS store games.

1019
01:19:26,497 --> 01:19:28,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to go back and visit some of them.

1020
01:19:28,478 --> 01:19:32,020
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny to me too, because there were games like Trade Wars 2002.

1021
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:35,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, bitch, we've lived 2002 now.

1022
01:19:35,202 --> 01:19:38,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nothing like Trade Wars.

1023
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:43,623
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of fun to see stuff in that context.

1024
01:19:43,623 --> 01:19:50,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, fun fact, when I was going back and selecting the game for tonight, this is not the first time I've picked a BBS store game.

1025
01:19:50,047 --> 01:19:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did Legend of the Red Dragon some time ago, which was another infamous BBS store game from the past.

1026
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:56,950
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was another one I had to pick at some point.

1027
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:02,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when I picked that other game, The Legend of the Red Dragon, this was it was somewhere in the 600s.

1028
01:20:02,974 --> 01:20:04,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was years ago.

1029
01:20:04,595 --> 01:20:10,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have picked the pip probably but I could not find a video of the terminal or even graphics.

1030
01:20:10,459 --> 01:20:15,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is like new now that I've even like proof that the terminal still exists.

1031
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:21,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And they even have on that site that I found they have the executables for the old door game and the EGA terminal.

1032
01:20:21,988 --> 01:20:27,213
[SPEAKER_01]: which is pretty, so I guess I could set up and get some video of my own, but I'm really lazy.

1033
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:33,218
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe someday, maybe that's a future VOG video project is trying to get some actual video of that EGA terminal.

1034
01:20:33,218 --> 01:20:37,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, again, through the research, I found out that the programmer of that game passed away.

1035
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,463
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really sad.

1036
01:20:39,463 --> 01:20:45,028
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at 99 to think what may have come in the future, or maybe what they could have gone back and done at some point.

1037
01:20:45,028 --> 01:20:45,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So

1038
01:20:45,837 --> 01:20:53,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anyway, there you go, your classic game of the week, the BBS door game or bulletin board door game, The Pit.

1039
01:20:53,520 --> 01:21:00,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And notably, it's EGA front end that I think really made it something special for the era.

1040
01:21:00,103 --> 01:21:00,804
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1041
01:21:00,804 --> 01:21:06,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with that, we're gonna get back into some news and travel around and talk about some things really quick with some rapid fire news, Loki.

1042
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:09,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't like another Titanfall 2 rumor?

1043
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:12,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people like constant disappointment.

1044
01:21:12,722 --> 01:21:18,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is another apparently surprise update that Titanfall 2 received recently.

1045
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:26,114
[SPEAKER_03]: The patch hit the game about a week ago and included fixes to matchmaking and stuff like that.

1046
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:28,416
[SPEAKER_03]: But along with that there was a

1047
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:43,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet or whatever talking about incoming transmission subject Nessie and then it gives three different Hexes, I think they're three different dates that are basically

1048
01:21:44,318 --> 01:21:47,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember if they're like binary or hexadecimal or something like that.

1049
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:51,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically represents, oh, I'm sorry, Unix time dates.

1050
01:21:51,062 --> 01:21:55,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So three different Unix time dates that represent Titanfall 1, 2 and Apex Legends.

1051
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:59,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks are thinking, does this mean there's another one coming?

1052
01:21:59,246 --> 01:21:59,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1053
01:21:59,867 --> 01:22:02,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a stretch.

1054
01:22:02,528 --> 01:22:09,292
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have a new game mode that was added to Titanfall 2 just called Question Mark.

1055
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:10,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1056
01:22:12,748 --> 01:22:14,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know what it is.

1057
01:22:14,108 --> 01:22:19,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It says your rockets about to get or it says your rockets will blot out the sun.

1058
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:21,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's that.

1059
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:23,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1060
01:22:23,391 --> 01:22:25,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just wait until they actually release Titanfall 3.

1061
01:22:25,771 --> 01:22:27,752
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's just wait until that announcement comes.

1062
01:22:27,752 --> 01:22:33,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's stop trying to guess that they're teasing something until they actually just announced something.

1063
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:35,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1064
01:22:35,754 --> 01:22:41,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a game, you know, the Game Awards.

1065
01:22:42,347 --> 01:22:45,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll have an announcement there.

1066
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:47,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1067
01:22:47,951 --> 01:22:50,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I'd like to talk about new LEGO sets.

1068
01:22:50,813 --> 01:22:53,754
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a brand new LEGO Mario set, and this one's kind of cool.

1069
01:22:53,754 --> 01:22:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a LEGO Piranha Plant.

1070
01:22:57,197 --> 01:23:01,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So LEGO's been doing these things with different flower sets that they have available.

1071
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:09,244
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get like artificial flowers and build them out of LEGO, and like put them in a pot that comes with it, and you know, you can arrange your flowers and stuff.

1072
01:23:09,244 --> 01:23:09,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now it's

1073
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:13,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a piranha plant for your desk.

1074
01:23:13,616 --> 01:23:14,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks awesome.

1075
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:19,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only 60 bucks, which is reasonable for Lego.

1076
01:23:19,941 --> 01:23:22,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely be picking this up at some point.

1077
01:23:22,283 --> 01:23:24,104
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes out very soon.

1078
01:23:24,104 --> 01:23:27,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think it's October.

1079
01:23:27,847 --> 01:23:30,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, November 6th.

1080
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:36,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best comment I saw about this in Discord was, hey, a plant I can't kill.

1081
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:36,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1082
01:23:38,427 --> 01:23:42,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you knock it off your desk, in which case it's temporarily dead.

1083
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:42,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1084
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, guess what?

1085
01:23:45,201 --> 01:23:51,765
[SPEAKER_01]: More datamining has revealed what could possibly be coming to future DLC for Mortal Kombat 1.

1086
01:23:51,765 --> 01:23:59,370
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we already know who's coming to the first Kombat Pack, but you know, why would they sell you just one Kombat Pack when they could sell you more?

1087
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:06,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So, some leaked characters that were datamined, spoiler alert, I guess, but this is all over the place.

1088
01:24:06,135 --> 01:24:09,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Jade, Cassie Cage, Kung Jin,

1089
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:13,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Frost, Conan the Barbarian,

1090
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,491
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very interesting.

1091
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:29,056
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had the Terminator in one of the Mortal Kombat games, so why not license Arnold again for Conan the Barbarian?

1092
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,677
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is the best.

1093
01:24:30,677 --> 01:24:35,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghostface, apparently also a potential Mortal Kombat 1 combatant.

1094
01:24:35,841 --> 01:24:46,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they licensed Ghostface the same way they did it in Dead by Daylight and licensed from the mask making company and not actually the Scream movie.

1095
01:24:46,769 --> 01:24:49,511
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind, if Ghostface does come to Mortal Kombat,

1096
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:54,874
[SPEAKER_01]: He may have nothing to do with the movies because in Dead by Daylight, Ghostface has nothing to do with the movies.

1097
01:24:54,874 --> 01:24:58,856
[SPEAKER_01]: They completely came up with a new origin story and character and all this stuff.

1098
01:24:58,856 --> 01:25:00,476
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people don't bother to read it.

1099
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:03,058
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go, Hey, I'm playing as the scream killer.

1100
01:25:03,058 --> 01:25:07,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be interesting to see how that all works in Mortal Kombat if that happens.

1101
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,101
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, playing as Ghostface would be pretty rad.

1102
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:11,422
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

1103
01:25:11,422 --> 01:25:12,883
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1104
01:25:12,883 --> 01:25:17,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on and check out some games that will be coming out a little sooner than that second combatant pack, Loki.

1105
01:25:18,492 --> 01:25:22,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, we're still in the thick of the technically fourth quarter.

1106
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:25,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, rumored second combatant pack important.

1107

1178
01:31:50,602 --> 01:31:52,643

[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have an email tonight, so we'll get to that in a little bit.

1193
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,400
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, some more stories.

1194
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1195
01:33:18,241 --> 01:33:21,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Payday 2 launch was not great.

1196
01:33:21,703 --> 01:33:27,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They had server problems because Payday 3, whatever.

1197
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:27,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Payday 2

1198
01:33:30,342 --> 01:33:32,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Payday 2, too.

1199
01:33:32,383 --> 01:33:37,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Payday 2 cheap to buy enough servers to run our game.

1200
01:33:37,006 --> 01:33:39,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently they had infrastructure problems.

1201
01:33:39,748 --> 01:33:40,569
[SPEAKER_03]: We are so sorry.

1202
01:33:40,569 --> 01:33:44,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Infrastructure did not hold up as expected, although it's impossible to prepare for every scenario.

1203
01:33:44,932 --> 01:33:46,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be able to do better.

1204
01:33:46,873 --> 01:33:54,538
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked tirelessly until we have restored all services and players can get back to heisting again without issues.

1205
01:33:54,538 --> 01:33:57,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind that this game is always online.

1206
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:58,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1207
01:34:18,181 --> 01:34:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, not great.

1208
01:34:20,204 --> 01:34:27,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, no matter what you choose, public, friends only, invite only, it will just matchmaker forever.

1209
01:34:27,254 --> 01:34:31,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, release days are usually tough for studios, but this, this is embarrassing.

1210
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:41,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, on PlayStation 5, there was also apparently the wrong build of the game pushed out to the network.

1211
01:34:41,353 --> 01:34:46,777
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, they were playing an older version of the game, so they were rolling out a patch to fix that.

1212
01:34:46,777 --> 01:34:49,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually the launch edition of the game.

1213
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:49,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

1214
01:34:49,579 --> 01:34:52,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

1215
01:34:52,121 --> 01:34:54,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And that came, of course, a day later.

1216
01:34:54,543 --> 01:34:59,687
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does suck for the people that paid an extra $30 to play the game before everybody else.

1217
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:03,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You paid to be a beta tester.

1218
01:35:03,134 --> 01:35:08,637
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be getting that money back at a class action as far as I'm concerned.

1219
01:35:08,637 --> 01:35:15,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm pretty sure all the legal binding agreements you agree to make them immune to that sort of thing, but it's bull.

1220
01:35:15,161 --> 01:35:23,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't we learned by now that like if you play a game, if you pay extra money to play a game a week before it comes out, you are the beta tester in this.

1221
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:36,569
[SPEAKER_03]: that DemiNez was happening here because there are going to be bugs and you get to find them and tell them to the developers and then they patch it out for everybody else that you know, paid the regular price.

1222
01:35:36,569 --> 01:35:44,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the problem is I can sit here and say yes, 100% that and at the same time go and I spent $100 on Diablo 4 and I got to play it early.

1223
01:35:44,676 --> 01:35:46,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me.

1224
01:35:46,017 --> 01:35:47,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1225
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:47,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the problem.

1226
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:48,339
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me.

1227
01:35:48,339 --> 01:35:51,501
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they do it.

1228
01:35:51,501 --> 01:35:52,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they do it.

1229
01:35:52,822 --> 01:35:53,423
[SPEAKER_03]: People will pay it.

1230
01:35:54,586 --> 01:35:59,556
[SPEAKER_03]: because people will pay it and even if you complain about it and stuff like that

1231
01:36:00,836 --> 01:36:05,119
[SPEAKER_03]: the next game that, you know, tickles your fancy that, you know.

1232
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:07,701
[SPEAKER_01]: But for what it's worth, Diablo 4 had a smooth launch.

1233
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:09,002
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nothing like Diablo 3.

1234
01:36:09,002 --> 01:36:14,446
[SPEAKER_01]: For what it's worth, they had those open, they were very smart to do those open test windows.

1235
01:36:14,446 --> 01:36:16,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So for what it's worth, maybe I'm not as big of a problem as you think.

1236
01:36:16,888 --> 01:36:19,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm telling you right now, I am not better than the problem.

1237
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:22,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I am right now, 100%.

1238
01:36:22,552 --> 01:36:29,917
[SPEAKER_03]: If Rockstar Games came out tomorrow and said, hey, Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to be available to play in a week early, if you buy our special edition, I was like,

1239
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:33,259
[SPEAKER_03]: How much is your special edition?

1240
01:36:33,259 --> 01:36:37,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, yeah, that that is unfortunately, we are all part of the problem.

1241
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,380
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1242
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:41,180
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1243
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:42,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I've come to live.

1244
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:46,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I've come to accept the fact that even if we weren't part of the problem, the problem would still exist.

1245
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:48,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1246
01:36:48,382 --> 01:36:49,582
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who doesn't do this, though?

1247
01:36:49,582 --> 01:36:51,102
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who isn't part of the problem?

1248
01:36:51,102 --> 01:36:52,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo.

1249
01:36:52,262 --> 01:36:58,824
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they ever did this with F-Zero, I would absolutely be like, oh, yes, let me let me pluck down the extra money.

1250
01:36:58,824 --> 01:36:59,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

1251
01:36:59,964 --> 01:37:00,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note,

1252
01:37:01,784 --> 01:37:03,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1253
01:37:03,405 --> 01:37:13,290
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, F099 is going to be adding more tracks soon, thanks to data miners who are mining that data.

1254
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:16,272
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working overtime on mining data.

1255
01:37:16,272 --> 01:37:17,712
[SPEAKER_03]: They are out there looking.

1256
01:37:17,712 --> 01:37:21,114
[SPEAKER_03]: They have found an arcade mode, a survive mode.

1257
01:37:21,114 --> 01:37:25,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade mode includes timers and time gates placed around the circuits.

1258
01:37:25,836 --> 01:37:26,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Survival mode.

1259
01:37:27,766 --> 01:37:29,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know what that's about yet.

1260
01:37:29,647 --> 01:37:35,411
[SPEAKER_03]: They said only one model has been found in a big flat square with a circle inside of it.

1261
01:37:35,411 --> 01:37:40,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it be F099 battle mode like Mario Kart?

1262
01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get some balloons and shells and stuff?

1263
01:37:43,216 --> 01:37:43,837
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be kind of cool.

1264
01:37:43,837 --> 01:37:45,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

1265
01:37:45,337 --> 01:37:46,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine?

1266
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:50,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Survival arcade mode sounds like it might be an offline type of version, though, that's based on time trials.

1267
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:52,042
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be actually really cool.

1268
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:53,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I hope that's what that is.

1269
01:37:54,107 --> 01:37:55,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's back up for a second though.

1270
01:37:55,728 --> 01:37:59,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's imagine a world where Mario Kart 99 exists.

1271
01:37:59,831 --> 01:38:06,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine battle, like original Mario Kart battle mode with 99 players?

1272
01:38:06,796 --> 01:38:09,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, aside from how like chaotic and trash it would be.

1273
01:38:11,446 --> 01:38:13,427
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty cool.

1274
01:38:13,427 --> 01:38:16,988
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura says, according to Bobby, we knew the extra tracks were coming.

1275
01:38:16,988 --> 01:38:19,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think it was as clear on the new modes, though.

1276
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:25,391
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably, you know, spotted or what have you before maybe in the early sizzle reels and stuff.

1277
01:38:25,391 --> 01:38:27,972
[SPEAKER_01]: PodCulture says, I want a new Blur game.

1278
01:38:27,972 --> 01:38:30,173
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, Blur is awesome.

1279
01:38:30,173 --> 01:38:31,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Blur 2 would have been.

1280
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:32,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft owns.

1281
01:38:32,494 --> 01:38:34,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a great comment somewhere.

1282
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:36,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was on social media or on Discord or what.

1283
01:38:36,315 --> 01:38:36,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1284
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:38,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know who to attribute this comment to.

1285
01:38:38,376 --> 01:38:40,217
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody had said, you know,

1286
01:38:41,337 --> 01:38:45,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft's going to own Activision and Blizzard now, and Activision's properties.

1287
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:49,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you squawk loud enough where Phil Spencer can hear it, it might happen.

1288
01:38:49,963 --> 01:38:55,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the comment, I want to say maybe it was our Discord said, I don't even care if it's Forza Blur.

1289
01:38:55,667 --> 01:38:56,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take it.

1290
01:38:56,948 --> 01:38:59,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, yes to that.

1291
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:01,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you about Forza Blur?

1292
01:39:01,491 --> 01:39:03,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1293
01:39:03,492 --> 01:39:05,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold it, underline it.

1294
01:39:05,094 --> 01:39:08,416
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.

1295
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1296
01:39:09,299 --> 01:39:15,843
[SPEAKER_03]: or even just make it a mode of like Horizon or something like that if you want to like, like spin it off or something.

1297
01:39:15,843 --> 01:39:16,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1298
01:39:16,464 --> 01:39:18,805
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they could make it its own franchise.

1299
01:39:18,805 --> 01:39:22,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And besides, Blur 2 looked pretty cool.

1300
01:39:22,408 --> 01:39:25,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the early stuff that they showed of that.

1301
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:27,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a bummer it didn't happen.

1302
01:39:27,471 --> 01:39:29,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I still need to play F-Zero 99.

1303
01:39:29,112 --> 01:39:29,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

1304
01:39:29,693 --> 01:39:32,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be the reason why we don't get a new F-Zero.

1305
01:39:32,655 --> 01:39:35,597
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably too late because launch week's the most important.

1306
01:39:35,597 --> 01:39:36,757
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I've been busy.

1307
01:39:36,757 --> 01:39:37,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave me alone.

1308
01:39:37,898 --> 01:39:38,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Umjammerlamie in MAME

1309
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:21,202
[SPEAKER_01]: um this is awesome i had no idea about this or like you know oh this is you know and i'm like i remember driving to arcade infinity and there was one of these here like that's that's where we were able to play one of these in the u.s was at arcade infinity and the machine was tiny i remember that because the pictures make it look big it wasn't like to play that stupid guitar i had like get on my knees to actually play that guitar um so but anyway

1310
01:40:22,043 --> 01:40:27,608
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is, if you want to be able to play this, it's been dumped and it's now playable in MAME.

1311
01:40:27,608 --> 01:40:36,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a port of the PS1 version, but it has some new high quality music, some new content and some new difficulty levels as well.

1312
01:40:36,236 --> 01:40:45,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so apparently, some person kept this in a barn for literally 10 years, and it was found and dumped.

1313
01:40:45,143 --> 01:40:45,564
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?

1314
01:40:46,715 --> 01:40:56,441
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying that actually the person that held this arcade machine was Jonathan Ross, who's, I think he's like a commentator in the UK or some type of news personality over there.

1315
01:40:56,441 --> 01:40:59,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of interesting.

1316
01:40:59,183 --> 01:41:01,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's funny to hear people talk about lost games.

1317
01:41:01,705 --> 01:41:04,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Okay, well, I literally remember playing this.

1318
01:41:04,587 --> 01:41:08,689
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be fair, that was probably the only place in the entire US that had this game.

1319
01:41:08,689 --> 01:41:12,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that like most people had no idea it existed to be to be fair.

1320
01:41:12,752 --> 01:41:15,514
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I thought that was fun.

1321
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:18,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get to the listener roundtable.

1322
01:41:18,641 --> 01:41:21,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Your chance to have a say on our program tonight.

1323
01:41:21,703 --> 01:41:25,144
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to ask us a question in chat, you sure can.

1324
01:41:25,144 --> 01:41:33,888
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also join our Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord, and you can join the green room and we'll take calls.

1325
01:41:33,888 --> 01:41:39,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read those emails here on the program.

1326
01:41:39,911 --> 01:41:42,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have one tonight from Garth Wolf.

1327
01:41:43,708 --> 01:41:48,870
[SPEAKER_01]: who wrote us, Dear OLR, this is funny because you're getting me and not DarkSakura.

1328
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:53,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think DarkSakura would have got this, but I know exactly what this is, what you're doing, Garth Wolfe.

1329
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:57,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And the email reads here, Dear OLR, oh my God, touch me right there.

1330
01:41:57,854 --> 01:41:59,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost there, touch me right there.

1331
01:41:59,695 --> 01:42:00,316
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1332
01:42:00,316 --> 01:42:02,977
[SPEAKER_01]: With love and tension, Kylie Minogue.

1333
01:42:02,977 --> 01:42:06,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, those are the lyrics to Tension by Kylie Minogue.

1334
01:42:06,278 --> 01:42:09,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have hereby invited a tangent train onto the show.

1335
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Last- yesterday, here's the thing.

1336
01:42:12,302 --> 01:42:14,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday, I actually went hiking.

1337
01:42:14,483 --> 01:42:24,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up in the mountains and I went and we went to these falls up in the mountains that my friend had been to once before and he thought they were really cool and he wanted to go back and I was like, I want to go hiking, that'll be fun.

1338
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:27,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fun, but it was very, very sore.

1339
01:42:27,512 --> 01:42:30,654
[SPEAKER_01]: On our way back, we decided, you know, we walked a lot yesterday.

1340
01:42:30,654 --> 01:42:33,597
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to celebrate by going out to the bar last night.

1341
01:42:34,377 --> 01:43:02,363
[SPEAKER_01]: but here's the thing the bar was empty as fuck like there was a handful of people there that was it usually on Saturday night it's it's popping but this week empty dead you know why because a little thing is going on about 90 miles west of here called Folsom Street Fair and a lot of the people that I think would have been the crowd to go out last night probably went over there for the day for those types of shenanigans so we had the place to ourself pretty much

1342
01:43:03,426 --> 01:43:09,612
[SPEAKER_01]: which means we have the jukebox to ourselves because all through apps now you can request songs on apps and it's all digital.

1343
01:43:09,612 --> 01:43:13,416
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when things come out, they're pretty much instantly on these digital jukeboxes.

1344
01:43:13,416 --> 01:43:19,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will have you know, I played Tension twice and Padam Padam once.

1345
01:43:20,473 --> 01:43:22,094
[SPEAKER_01]: on the jukebox last night.

1346
01:43:22,094 --> 01:43:22,515
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1347
01:43:22,515 --> 01:43:23,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my gaming week.

1348
01:43:23,776 --> 01:43:29,581
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I gamified the jukebox over there at the local club.

1349
01:43:29,581 --> 01:43:31,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.

1350
01:43:31,062 --> 01:43:33,184
[SPEAKER_01]: SJ100 Matt says, saw your hiking photos.

1351
01:43:33,184 --> 01:43:33,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.

1352
01:43:33,704 --> 01:43:35,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, once in a while I get outside and play.

1353
01:43:35,546 --> 01:43:39,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am able to video game it because guess what?

1354
01:43:39,229 --> 01:43:45,375
[SPEAKER_01]: The trailhead way at the end by the falls was a Pokestop and a Pikmin mushroom.

1355
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:52,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody in Pikmin Bloom got a postcard for me today from the trailhead way out there in the middle of nowhere.

1356
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of fun.

1357
01:43:54,294 --> 01:44:02,099
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkDeadSteel wants to point out that The Misses and himself have been co-opping Illusion Island on Switch.

1358
01:44:02,099 --> 01:44:05,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super fun platformer or Metroidvania.

1359
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:08,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've heard a lot about Illusion Island and that it's a lot of fun.

1360
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:13,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Bobby and Mrs. Blackwolf have also been playing their way through this game and it's a lot of fun.

1361
01:44:13,366 --> 01:44:15,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have to check this out.

1362
01:44:15,407 --> 01:44:18,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of wasn't on my list, but I thought it looked cool.

1363
01:44:19,209 --> 01:44:23,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I'm glad to hear that the game is actually fun on top of that as well.

1364
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:25,110
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's pretty great.

1365
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:32,172
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight for our folks?

1366
01:44:32,172 --> 01:44:33,973
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, we don't.

1367
01:44:33,973 --> 01:44:35,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked.

1368
01:44:35,153 --> 01:44:36,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh.

1369
01:44:36,453 --> 01:44:39,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say it's a slow news week, but it really wasn't.

1370
01:44:39,154 --> 01:44:43,875
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that it was kind of like a couple really big stories.

1371
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:47,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was it.

1372
01:44:47,516 --> 01:44:48,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Silence everywhere else.

1373
01:44:49,573 --> 01:44:52,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then with that, we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

1374
01:44:52,094 --> 01:44:58,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a little bit of a shorter show this week, but that's how it goes when we're down a host, although completely understandable with the holiday going on and everything.

1375
01:44:58,655 --> 01:45:07,517
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will be back next week to do this all again and talk about what we've been playing for the week, as well as whatever surprise news comes up Monday morning.

1376
01:45:07,517 --> 01:45:11,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what else is going to get leaked, whether it be in a court document or what have you.

1377
01:45:13,963 --> 01:45:16,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, thank you so much for being here tonight.

1378
01:45:16,044 --> 01:45:20,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read the standards feel and then I'll ask you to give us a final thought here.

1379
01:45:20,886 --> 01:45:23,167
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1380
01:45:23,167 --> 01:45:26,128
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed what you heard here, please tell a friend or two about the show.

1381
01:45:26,128 --> 01:45:30,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices to put out on air.

1382
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:37,715
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify or wherever it is you found this program go an awful long way.

1383
01:45:37,715 --> 01:45:38,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Super appreciate it.

1384
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:43,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Please make sure you're also following VOG Network on YouTube over at VOG Network.

1385
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:46,282
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some fun stuff planned for the coming week.

1386
01:45:46,282 --> 01:45:51,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And our network as well on Twitch also at VOG Network.

1387
01:45:51,566 --> 01:45:54,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's go around to get final thoughts with that.

1388
01:45:54,268 --> 01:45:55,469
[SPEAKER_01]: So Loki, your final thought tonight.

1389
01:45:56,552 --> 01:46:00,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my final thought is, uh, go watch my finale if you haven't watched it yet.

1390
01:46:00,074 --> 01:46:02,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have watched it, watch it again, because why not?

1391
01:46:02,616 --> 01:46:03,136
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

1392
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I like watching it.

1393
01:46:03,957 --> 01:46:04,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I've watched it several times.

1394
01:46:04,738 --> 01:46:06,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch it with a friend.

1395
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:06,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1396
01:46:06,959 --> 01:46:08,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's a lot of fun.

1397
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:11,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, hopefully I'll have my new episode out here soon.

1398
01:46:11,322 --> 01:46:17,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sooner or later, I have a lot I've been working on and hey, you never know, there may be another giant robot in it.

1399
01:46:17,806 --> 01:46:18,186
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1400
01:46:18,186 --> 01:46:20,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't get away from making giant robots.

1401
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:20,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1402
01:46:22,475 --> 01:46:28,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so my final thought tonight, I'll also plug my personal streaming, but I'm going to drop a whopper on all of you right now.

1403
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:34,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about it more tomorrow because I have decided I'm no longer streaming Baldur's Gate 3 co-op.

1404
01:46:34,045 --> 01:46:38,688
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to, we're going to end our co-op play of Baldur's Gate 3 after two sessions.

1405
01:46:38,688 --> 01:46:41,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I've decided we're moving on and I'm going to talk all about why.

1406
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:42,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave it on that cliffhanger.

1407
01:46:42,912 --> 01:46:46,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk all about why we're making that change tomorrow.

1408
01:46:46,214 --> 01:46:48,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I, I'll give you this hint.

1409
01:46:48,696 --> 01:46:50,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I,

1410
01:46:51,137 --> 01:46:53,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can do a better stream.

1411
01:46:53,118 --> 01:46:57,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may actually surprise you that I'm going to say that, but I think we can do a better stream.

1412
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So Baldur's Gate 3 isn't working.

1413
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:06,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And considering I was so complimentary about that game earlier, and there are still a lot of positive feelings I have around that game,

1414
01:47:07,084 --> 01:47:09,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you all are curious what's going on there.

1415
01:47:09,365 --> 01:47:10,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Shane do something wrong?

1416
01:47:10,585 --> 01:47:11,185
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he didn't.

1417
01:47:11,185 --> 01:47:11,505
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1418
01:47:11,505 --> 01:47:14,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, besides opening that door when he shouldn't have.

1419
01:47:14,046 --> 01:47:16,247
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's neither here nor there.

1420
01:47:16,247 --> 01:47:28,850
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in fact, Shane will be joining myself tomorrow to start our playthrough of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet together, which I had started before, but never finished.

1421
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:32,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna start the Pokemon Scarlet playthrough tomorrow.

1422
01:47:32,631 --> 01:47:34,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Scarlet for me, Violet for Shane.

1423
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:37,394
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do that together on co-op tomorrow.

1424
01:47:37,394 --> 01:47:44,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's gonna go well because I've streamed that game before and that's gonna be a lot easier, I think, for a variety of reasons, which we'll talk about very soon.

1425
01:47:46,174 --> 01:47:48,855
[SPEAKER_01]: QuestBuster says it's all good, you gave it an honest go.

1426
01:47:48,855 --> 01:47:50,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, I appreciate that.

1427
01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:54,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently some news breaking right here at the end of the show.

1428
01:47:54,777 --> 01:47:57,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like the Rider Strike is done.

1429
01:47:57,538 --> 01:48:03,000
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a deal, WGA and AMTP reached tentative agreement to end the Rider Strike.

1430
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that is promising news.

1431
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:05,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Now do the same for the actors.

1432
01:48:06,241 --> 01:48:22,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that does mean, you know, if they've been able to come to an agreement on some of those things like AI and so forth, and that hopefully means they're about to come to an agreement with the actors and all that as well, because I'll tell you what, this year's TV movie roster is already fucked as a result of this.

1433
01:48:22,426 --> 01:48:30,968
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why there's certain things like, like, I think the Mean Girls musical movie was not supposed to get a theatrical release, but it is now.

1434
01:48:32,068 --> 01:48:38,152
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably going to be a winter season of Big Brother on CBS, which is fine, because I love Big Brother.

1435
01:48:38,152 --> 01:48:43,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, can I just say my opinion on Big Brother real quick?

1436
01:48:43,155 --> 01:48:45,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Ciri domination yet again.

1437
01:48:45,217 --> 01:48:53,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know she's in a little trouble right now as of late, but look, look, if they were foolish not to evict her the very first week,

1438
01:48:54,068 --> 01:48:55,509
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.

1439
01:48:55,509 --> 01:48:59,591
[SPEAKER_01]: She that that that woman knows how to fucking play a strategy game.

1440
01:48:59,591 --> 01:49:01,752
[SPEAKER_01]: She's she's one of the best there ever was.

1441
01:49:01,752 --> 01:49:03,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's got a lock on that house.

1442
01:49:03,913 --> 01:49:04,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that.

1443
01:49:04,813 --> 01:49:05,994
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's gonna be a winner, big brother.

1444
01:49:05,994 --> 01:49:10,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all because the writer strike went on for 110 days and all this.

1445
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:14,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, SJ 100 Matt said we were gonna get a lot of game shows and things with influencers.

1446
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:19,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's hope the actors follow suit on Monday and everybody can get back to work.

1447
01:49:19,462 --> 01:49:23,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of all, let's hope for a fair deal.

1448
01:49:23,223 --> 01:49:27,905
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know I will be really relieved as somebody who loves panels at cons.

1449
01:49:27,905 --> 01:49:38,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be very relieved when the actors sign that deal so they can go back to talking about like, like you can actually get, you know, Gates, McFadden, Jonathan Frakes to talk about Star Trek.

1450
01:49:39,352 --> 01:49:41,192
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
