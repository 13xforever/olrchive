9728	19436	Steam turns 20, and reminded me of the era of when It and Half-Life Involves Other Works were dressed in an olive green only slightly less insulting than the Windows XP theme of the same color.
19436	27623	Seeing that color in characters again on the Steam Store homepage was pleasant, an instant voyage across 20 years of gaming history catalyzed by one color of vegetable I may have never eaten.
28205	29929	This is the intro trip down memory lane.
29929	34798	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to reminisce and bring you the rest of the week's gaming news.
34798	36903	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
38864	46150	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46150	56439	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again with episode number 974 of our show for tonight, September the 17th of 2023.
56439	60543	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined each and every week by my co-hosts.
60543	62845	First off, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
63465	65867	J.K., she's not here yet.
65867	70511	It's Rosh Hashanah, so she's not available until about 7.50 when it's dark.
70511	73973	So she's going to pop in if our show goes that long.
73973	74454	I don't know.
74454	77436	We have a lot of news, but we also only have two of us tonight.
77436	78117	So we'll see.
78117	79458	We're going to play it by ear.
79458	86183	So joining me for a lot of news, a busier news week than I would have expected here in early September.
86183	88145	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
88145	88645	Hello.
88645	89406	Hey, Loki, how are you?
90285	90945	I'm pretty good.
90945	91546	Good, good.
91546	95247	So I noticed, you know, you've got a game playing behind you tonight.
95247	105371	Because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
105371	109873	And you can find us at VOGnetwork.com and pretty much any social media out there VOG Network.
110913	115319	So I was going to say, playing behind you, the video live, is Starfield.
115319	117442	And that makes me go- Which is what I would have played last week.
117442	120225	I was going to say, did you finally get around to playing Starfield?
120225	120926	Oh, okay.
120926	121707	No, no, no.
121707	123910	No, I said that was the video I was going to play last week.
123910	126714	Because if you remember, last week I didn't have a video behind me because-
127314	128114	I was rendering a video.
144123	151749	The short version of what you posted earlier this week that is like your Magnus opus of videos.
151749	152910	Kind of, yeah.
152910	160736	So it's basically, it's a culmination of lore and it's kind of like celebrating my content creation journey, sort of.
161196	164400	because it goes through a lot of the older SMPs that I was a part of.
164400	167023	There's a lot of cameos from every SMP.
167023	170566	VOG Minecraft has a cameo in there for a brief part.
170566	176072	I saw the VOG Minecraft server in there and I was actually going to try to show it here if I could remember.
176072	180818	It was kind of early on in the video, but yeah, I remember seeing that and I was like, oh, it's the VOG Minecraft server.
181647	184668	Yeah, that server, the file I have is corrupted.
184668	186768	So there's parts that are missing.
186768	191329	But yeah, it's a little bit further on in that.
191329	193390	Because that's a Collusion MC Season 2.
193390	196571	But still, you can still see some of these amazing builds that you've done.
196571	198731	And again, we're looking at video.
198731	206373	But if you're listening on the podcast feed, and you want to see this video for yourself, well, isn't that quite the teaser and commercial for you to go check out LokiOLR's channel over
207253	215938	It took a literal month to edit the whole thing together because it's basically a movie at this point.
215938	220320	We did a live premiere of it and everybody was emotional watching it.
220320	227043	I caught the last two minutes of that because I was working when it premiered, but I saw the last two minutes.
227043	230825	I was like, Loki's chat's hella popping off.
230825	231645	Good for him.
231645	232745	So it was good.
232745	233346	Yeah.
236467	242949	For sure, like everybody really thoroughly enjoyed it and they like understood why it took so long to put together.
242949	245610	But yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
245610	250511	You have shot after shot of just like floating and flying and all of these different servers.
250511	253732	This is like I imagine there's hundreds of shots.
253732	254992	That's my family realm right there.
254992	255392	Yeah.
255392	256733	The next one should be.
256733	257153	There it is.
257153	258113	There's the VOG server.
258113	258473	Yep.
258473	259053	Woo.
259053	262174	And I saw the Black Wolf Stadium down here in OLR.
262174	263174	Black Wolf Stadium.
263174	263474	Yeah.
263474	264995	And we've got the, was it?
266430	271032	like BobbyRules or BlackwolfRules and someone SkyDrews or something like that.
271032	271373	Wait a minute.
271373	271693	Wait a minute.
271693	272433	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
272433	273454	Isn't this on the old?
273454	273814	I'm sorry.
273814	282598	I'm very sorry to the podcast folks to refer to video and all that, but I can't help but notice because I remember this on the old VOG Network server.
282598	283799	Isn't this what you're flying by?
283799	286780	Because I remember it got carved out and highlighted at some point.
286780	291483	Isn't it like the crappy little dumpy home that I first built on the server?
292063	293564	Thank you for watching!
311347	332162	Because it corrupted, and so it had to regenerate itself, but... Yeah, it was enough to where I could at least film some of it in there, so... The whole premise is that I'm going... Like, I have a device that I made on Channel 64, it's like a portal that allows me to travel back in time through different servers to go to do different things.
332602	333263	Thank you for watching!
347563	352265	Take his head back from myself to get to the current season of Hermitcraft.
352265	364852	So there's like this big old chase scene and then the antagonists, the administration start pursuing and it just keeps, it just keeps escalating going and more and more like craziness that's in there.
365648	367549	So it's fun.
367549	378294	PodCulture in chat says, you know, something that I see a lot when you when you talk about your, you know, Minecraft and how, you know, how far down the rabbit hole you've fallen in the content creation, all that.
378294	382356	PodCulture says, I would not know how to even start playing Minecraft.
382356	384517	It sounds crazy.
384517	389420	Where where could where should somebody even begin if they want to get into Minecraft now here in 2023?
391552	400415	I mean, there's a lot of, like, the game does some, like, not a great job of, like, introducing you to different things.
400415	406617	There's a bunch of different, like, kind of survival series and, like, kind of talking about gameplay and stuff.
406617	411639	I know, like, Waddles used to do one a while back.
411639	417101	There's Pixel Riffs did kind of, like, a, you know, basics to Minecraft.
417101	419622	A lot of it you kind of have to search up for.
419622	419922	They...
420982	439576	do some weird stuff with the new areas in the game like they have like part where you can learn some of the redstone stuff by going down to an ancient city which has like this unkillable monster there which I don't know why you'd put early game tutorials down in a you know like a
440123	442484	a city like that, but you know, that's what they've got.
442484	450507	Okay, MereMuse has a gold star comment here though in our chat, twitch.tv, VOG Network, by saying, you start by punching a tree with your bare hands, correct?
450507	451948	That is how you start.
451948	464313	Right, they do, yeah, there's prompts, like somewhat, there's some prompts in the game, they'll tell you like, okay, punch a tree, create a crafting table, you know, create a pickaxe type of thing, so they will walk you through like,
464893	468055	The first three steps or four steps and then that's it.
468055	471858	And then the rest you kind of have to figure out as you go along.
471858	475321	Then you get different recipes that you can learn how to do stuff with that.
475321	482927	But like the intricate details of the game and stuff, there's not really a good way that they present it, unfortunately.
483625	489307	Alright, well, there's lots of other games out there besides Minecraft we'll talk about a lot tonight.
489307	494169	But I definitely want to make sure you got a plug for your video tonight because it also was your birthday this week.
494169	499972	I know we kind of acknowledged that already on last week's show because you know, it was the next day but some folks in chat were curious.
499972	500952	How was your birthday?
502133	503374	I was good, I didn't really do anything.
503374	511583	I took the day off to, because I was originally going to play more on our Season 3 server, so that's why I had taken the time off.
511583	518371	I wanted to livestream that day, but it ended up that I had to like re-render my video like three times because there was different pieces.
518931	529861	Like Premiere did some weird thing where it swapped out some of the audio in there because I was copying something from another project file that had some files that were named the same.
529861	534445	And so because I copied certain things, it's like, I'm just gonna override your audio for this.
534445	536787	And so I had to go through and catch that.
536787	541230	And then there was a second time I had to chop a piece off the end that I had
541971	546053	moved out over there when I was fixing the audio previously.
546053	549335	So it took a few times to do all that, and I was able to, like, polish it and stuff.
549335	556219	But finally was able to release it, like, on that Monday, you know, so we premiered it.
556219	565984	And that was just a lot of fun to get everybody's impression of it, because I'd shown off, like, especially the people I play with, I'd shown off, like, parts of it, but I didn't show, like, the end or anything.
565984	567825	And so there's a lot of parts like, what?
567825	569726	You know, it was pretty cool.
569726	570507	That's nice.
570507	570687	Great.
571347	575049	All right, well, let's get into the gaming news from this week.
575049	583774	And, you know, as I was saying a little bit ago, you know, for being a random week in September, there is sure been a lot of news this week and some of it good, some of it not so good.
583774	586835	And we're going to start with the biggest drama of all.
586835	588676	And I don't know what else to call this.
588676	596781	This is just like this is a literal implosion of sorts of a big chunk of like indie and midsize developers with this.
596781	600063	And I think any of you that follow gaming news casually know what I'm talking about.
600743	604204	Loki, what the hell happened this week?
604204	611266	So this week, Unity decided to make the announcement that they were changing their pricing structure, basically.
611266	614567	And I'm sorry, I'm going to make this super simple for those that don't know.
614567	626931	If you don't know, Unity is a game building engine that powers many of the games that you've probably played at some point, including like Cult of the Lamb, even some mobile phone games like Pokemon Go, I believe, run on Unity.
626931	629572	So it's a Skyline, you know, like some of that.
629692	633774	It's a game engine that many of your favorite games have probably used.
633774	634274	Anyway, sorry.
634274	636355	Yeah, it's like Unreal Engine or something like that.
636355	638537	You know, it's just it's an engine that people use.
638537	644139	A lot of people use it because it is free or it's it's free for smaller developers.
644139	646080	You basically get the free version.
646080	654945	And if you make over one hundred thousand dollars in the year, then you pay them a licensing fee, which is like I think like I don't remember how much it was a month.
654945	657826	But originally they were going to be, you know, doing that.
659592	665674	Now, though, they've gone full corporate greed and decided, hey, you know what?
665674	670435	We're going to charge you 20 cents every time someone installs your game.
670435	672396	20 cents every time.
672396	676337	And so that is not good.
676337	683939	Now, granted, they said that there's different monetary amounts that you have to hit in order to make that happen.
684602	694765	but you know like for example they said 200 you have to make $200,000 in a year and within the last 12 months had 200,000 lifetime game installs.
694765	699007	The problem is though is they're also going back and retroactively
700803	703105	They are getting rid of the Unity Plus Tier
717449	722951	They're basically charging, it's up to 20 cents per install.
722951	728052	So if you're personal or plus, it's 20 cents per install.
728052	736294	If you are Unity Pro, it's like 15 cents and then it scales down depending on the number of installs that you have.
736294	737295	But it's a lot of money.
737295	744577	I mean, especially if you put your game out for, say, I make a game and I put it out for you to play and it just pops off, it just goes nuts.
744577	745237	You could be
746726	750049	having to pay more money than you've made on the actual game itself.
750049	758297	Like they were I think there was an example of Vampire Survivor, I think, where they were charging like 99 cents for their game.
758297	763763	And so they had, you know, made quite a bit of money on it, but had like millions of installs.
763763	768827	They'd be owing them lots and lots of money from this.
768827	770269	And of course, all the developers hate it.
770269	771490	All the developers are just like,
771974	773116	This is ridiculous.
773116	784493	You know, first off, you can't just change the agreement that we, you know, because these developers signed agreements to, you know, work with Unity, especially when they're that big.
784493	786356	And so you can't just change the agreement.
787212	790554	without any sort of agreement from both parties.
790554	793996	It's unilaterally what they're trying to do here.
793996	798719	It's eroded any trust that developers have had with Unity to begin with.
798719	802941	There's been lots of different protests, and we're going to kind of talk a little bit about some of that.
802941	812947	And really what it comes down to is they're also trying to use this as a bargaining chip to try to get rid of some of their competition in the analytics space.
812947	815248	So there's a
817294	822517	company, I want to say it's, I'm trying to remember the dev company was.
822517	833462	Basically, it's a competing company that does like kind of user acquisition and analytics, and they're targeting them saying, hey, you know what, if you use our service that does the same thing, maybe we can, you know, waive that fee for you.
833462	843287	So they're trying to unfairly attack this other company and try to basically like strong arm or blackmail people into using their services for this stuff.
845259	850541	So, like, yeah, there's different developers that talk about it, like, for example, make a game, game is freemium.
850541	855522	Game makes $200,000 from in-app purchases after being installed 3 million times.
855522	859184	Now I own Unity 20 cents per 2.8 million installs.
859184	859464	$560,000.
859464	860064	That's $360,000 more than we made.
860064	861204	So that's always nice.
861204	862705	Things that they said that, you know,
869560	873501	Some of the stuff that really pissed off the developers.
873501	881164	They are saying that they have a way to track the installs, but they can't say how they're doing it, because that's proprietary.
881164	893128	And they said that, you know, that even though people could uninstall and reinstall a game, you know, with a script to, like, say, target or attack a developer, you know, we'll work with you on solving that.
893128	899110	If, you know, someone accidentally does that or does that intentionally, well, we'll try to work with you on that.
901028	910134	If I have a game that goes on Game Pass or on PlayStation Now or something like that, you have to pay for all those installs.
910134	912556	How are they going to do that through those third parties?
912556	922583	They said that they're going to be charging the console owners for that, like the actual Microsoft and Sony, which I got to be thinking if I'm Microsoft or Sony,
923508	924148	DarkSakura
947177	963903	that what's happening right now, like if you look at Unity's Twitter account and you go over there, and this just happened like two hours ago before we went live tonight, they've actually put in a, we have heard you, we apologize for the confusion and angst, the runtime fee policy we announced on Tuesday caused.
963903	970426	We are listening, talking to our team members, community, customers, and partners, and we will be making changes to the policy.
970426	972367	We will share an update in a couple of days.
972367	974087	Thank you for your honest and critical feedback.
974087	974788	It's too late.
974788	975448	It's too late.
975888	975988	it's
992404	1000748	Unity states that only 10% of their customers will be affected, making it sound less bad than it is.
1000748	1004909	As of the Gaming Report 2022, Unity had 230,000 developers.
1004909	1008391	That's around 23,000 developers affected by the change.
1008391	1011052	Lots of studios have posted statements about moving engines.
1011732	1014373	Uh, that's in addition to a post on September 12th.
1014373	1016733	Hello, we've heard your questions and feedback.
1016733	1018454	Another post on September 12th.
1018454	1019854	Today we announced a change.
1019854	1022735	We wanted to provide a few clarifying answers.
1022735	1030397	Uh, and some of the things you were just talking about is that, you know, uh, I don't know some of the stuff about like, uh, good charity games and stuff they were backtracking on.
1030397	1035518	So like, it just showed how piss poorly researched the whole thing was.
1036210	1041274	There's also no way to tell what's a charity game and what's not a charity game.
1041274	1045877	Why wouldn't you just say, oh, it's all for charity?
1045877	1049679	And then how many hours is Unity spending investigating if something is charity?
1049679	1052622	It's just not thought out well.
1052622	1054043	You know what this sounds like?
1054043	1055724	This honest to God sounds like?
1055724	1057105	This sounds like one of those shh
1057705	1063868	Bonehead CEO decisions where the CEO does something fucking stupid.
1063868	1065028	Well, we'll get to that.
1065028	1067669	You know, you know, I got that queued up, Loki.
1067669	1068770	I got my receipts.
1068770	1070490	It's queued up.
1070490	1071391	We're going to get there.
1071391	1075452	We're going on a journey tonight and we will be pulling over at that station.
1075452	1077213	OK, that all being said.
1079647	1082628	Dammit, where was I before you got me going on that?
1082628	1083848	Sorry.
1083848	1084448	No, you're fine.
1084448	1084908	You're fine.
1084908	1087609	But um, yeah, bad decisions by CEOs.
1087609	1088969	Okay, so this this strikes me.
1088969	1092130	So those things were like the CEO was like, we're gonna do this.
1092130	1093170	Make it happen.
1093170	1094570	Just fucking make it happen.
1094570	1102372	Because your jobs on like, it sounds like something that the idiot CEO of Twitter, and we're gonna call it Twitter.
1103052	1107755	because we don't call it that Twitter belongs to the people and the people are calling it Twitter.
1107755	1117981	However, somebody decided they could pay $44 billion for Twitter to make dumb shit decisions like, look, I can pick up and move the server myself.
1117981	1121063	Therefore, how hard are these servers to actually move?
1121063	1122224	Make it happen.
1122224	1128328	And such hits as tell me your best employee on the team so I can fire you and promote your employee.
1128928	1130669	and who needs to pay the rent?
1130669	1131550	What are they going to do?
1131550	1132730	Kick us out?
1132730	1140455	And I'm going to install an amazing seizure light on the top of my building across from the Senior Citizen Center, etc, etc.
1140455	1148060	Just add this Unity debacle to the list of decisions by people who don't deserve to be rich.
1150396	1163763	Now, there are certain things I am not allowed to say on Twitch.television, but every time I see a cartoon gif of a guillotine on Blue Sky, I'm like, you know, well, actually, there are no gifs on Blue Sky.
1163763	1175969	But when I see a cartoon gif on some forum, sometimes I'm like, you know, I understand it more and more with each passing day.
1175969	1176349	Anyway, yeah.
1176855	1188699	By the way, Shane in chat said, there's a dev who made a game with proceeds going to Planned Parenthood and a children's hospital and reached out for clarification on the charity aspect.
1188699	1195902	Unity told them those counted as political organizations and would not count.
1195902	1201664	Open mouth insert foot.
1201664	1201844	Yeah.
1202155	1205858	Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt you, Loki, but I'm getting warmed up.
1205858	1206999	We got the first course.
1206999	1207820	Let's let's go out.
1207820	1209141	We got we still got more coming.
1209141	1211603	Let's let's go to the kitchen and see what's cooking next.
1211603	1215246	So this isn't so much a story because like it's kind of skewed.
1215246	1224113	So the story was that CEO John Riccatello sold 2000 shares a week before Unity revealed its runtime.
1224113	1226075	Now, to be fair, they
1227176	1234064	He's not the only one that sold shares and he's been selling shares on a regular basis up to this time.
1234064	1237067	So these are regularly scheduled things.
1237067	1245657	However, that said, an announcement like this is something that obviously you would plan in advance.
1246465	1247487	relatively.
1247487	1251612	So if you know you're going to be taking the company all year long, then why not?
1251612	1258521	You know, well, it wasn't a large it was Yeah, it wasn't a large number of shares that he owned.
1258521	1262747	It was, you know, they sold off as like a point something percent of the shares.
1262747	1263648	How many shares?
1263648	1264369	How many shares did you say?
1265957	1271501	Uh, it was like a certain percentage to like point something percent of shares, but it, this was 2000 last week.
1271501	1272262	Okay.
1272262	1273062	And totally.
1273062	1274363	I want y'all to remember that number.
1274363	1275103	Cause we're going to come.
1275103	1276564	I want y'all to remember that 2000 number.
1276564	1277565	Cause we're coming back to it.
1277565	1278166	We're coming back to it.
1278166	1278706	Write that down.
1278706	1279186	Okay.
1279186	1280207	We're coming back to it.
1280207	1280427	Yeah.
1280427	1284310	So he sold a total of 50,000 shares this week or year.
1284310	1288993	Um, so far and other people in the company have sold shares as well.
1288993	1291675	So the unity present president of growth.
1293841	1300143	sold 37,500 shares on September 1st for $1.4 million.
1300143	1308547	We had the board director who sold almost 70,000 shares August 30th for around $2.5 million.
1308547	1312389	So they are selling shares on a regular basis, but they knew this was coming.
1312389	1315570	Granted, if they sold right before
1316931	1319272	then you can make the argument, oh, well, it's insider trading.
1319272	1327696	But if you're selling on a regular basis up to that, they could still plan their share sales around the announcements that they have coming as well.
1327696	1331618	So that's still kind of on the fence of whether that could be insider trade or not.
1331618	1337921	But to remind folks at home that may not remember John Riccatello, John Riccatello is the wonderful CEO at EA.
1338701	1342685	Another fantastic company who suggested that, hey, you know what?
1342685	1348030	I think it'd be really cool if players had to pay to reload their guns in Battlefield.
1348030	1351553	This is the douchebag that came up with that kind of stuff.
1351553	1355977	So you can see how he may be wanting to charge per install for
1357345	1357465	and
1375268	1382570	but uh or in the last week but you know it's still uh you know he's been selling shares slowly over the past year.
1382570	1404475	I would like to make the case for why John Riccatello deserves to go to trial over this and I don't I and I I actually don't think this is a wild theory like I feel like this I guess feel like there is so much negative buzz out there there are in fact people calling for blood and if this had been 15 years ago I would have said
1405355	1416244	The government doesn't understand enough about this whole industry to understand that there's blood to be drawn here or the magnitude of what's going on.
1416244	1430915	However, now that the government has interfered in such things as Microsoft and Activision Blizzard and that whole thing, we've seen Mortal Kombat referenced in a Supreme Court document, I think we're at this case where politics realizes that video gaming is a serious industry.
1431375	1434718	Can we take a quick trip back down memory lane, please?
1434718	1440302	I'd like you all to remember the case of Martha Stewart.
1440302	1441684	According to the U.S.
1441684	1448649	Security and Exchange Commission, I'm just reading straight off the Wikipedia, but you know, whatever, Stewart avoided a loss of $45,000 by selling 3,928 shares.
1448649	1450611	That's about less than twice that 2000 number, right?
1458813	1458913	and
1476833	1482676	By the way, if you look at Unity stock this week, it is currently tracking down 6%.
1482676	1485277	Look at this big dip that happened on Tuesday.
1485277	1486057	What could this be?
1486057	1487158	Or actually it was Wednesday.
1487158	1488659	Oh, here's some good ones too.
1488659	1490960	I just, I just saw as well.
1490960	1492160	So you know what else?
1492160	1496422	Know what other game, um, happens to be made with Unity?
1496422	1497383	Pokemon Go.
1497383	1497703	Oh, I know.
1498960	1503161	So they would they would owe $126 million to you.
1503161	1507621	But they're charging twice as much for a remote raid pass now they can afford it.
1507621	1508122	Fuck them.
1508122	1509262	I don't I did.
1509262	1514023	But the Niantic is the company I feel least sorry for this whole situation.
1514023	1516163	Like, honestly.
1516163	1517083	Yeah.
1517083	1525324	All I'm saying is that it is time for John Riccatello to answer to a judge.
1525324	1528225	Is it that different from what Martha Stewart went to jail for?
1529459	1532802	No.
1532802	1535584	I don't think so.
1535584	1545411	And yeah, I know that this whole thing is only set to come after January 2024 and all that stuff, but I'm making the case that this straight up, he sold those shares because he gave that order and knew it was coming.
1546543	1554569	and whether, you know, it was a time thing and not plant tough, tough titty said the kitty because these optics are terrible.
1554569	1558391	So you need to go in front of a fucking judge and explain yourself.
1558391	1560593	Because and then this doesn't make sense.
1560593	1561994	It don't add up.
1561994	1566437	Let's just pretend like for a second there that they had no idea this was coming.
1566437	1570120	How did you not know that this that people wouldn't like this?
1570120	1571361	I'm just shocked.
1572222	1573843	Shocked that they didn't like it.
1573843	1597333	So they've been a lot of different developers have been reaching out to their legal Teams and of course, you know finding that this none of this seems to be legal at all So it's gonna be interesting to see them even try to implement this Also, they may be liable to their shareholders since that's what they seem to be concerned about because of this bad decision and
1598942	1603743	what it did to the stock, even though it wasn't a huge drop, still something.
1603743	1612744	And so they may be responsible for that as well.
1612744	1617105	By the way, Unity had to cancel a town hall.
1617105	1620526	I don't know if you saw that because there were legitimate death threats that were made.
1620526	1620966	I'm not sure.
1620966	1625167	It's a little bit fuzzy, like if that actually came from within Unity or not.
1625167	1626027	It was within Unity.
1626027	1626287	Yes.
1627727	1628407	Wow.
1628407	1631089	Now, please note the things I said earlier.
1631089	1636491	I hope you all understand hyperbole, because this stuff obviously crosses a very serious line in the real world.
1636491	1638452	Like, you don't make these types of threats.
1638452	1640473	Like, legal threats?
1640473	1641453	I'm all for that.
1641453	1642314	Legal threats?
1642314	1643614	Let's go.
1643614	1652678	This is obviously a line far crossed, but, I mean, it still shows, like, the far-reaching implications of a decision like this.
1652678	1656280	And, you know, for somebody at Unity, and not that I'm excusing it,
1657040	1662343	But obviously they felt like it was over and they were going to do something drastic as a result.
1662343	1671009	Not that I'm excusing it, but I'm just trying to evaluate how did we get this far to this point at this time?
1671009	1671549	Wild.
1671549	1673871	I don't know.
1673871	1678974	But at this point, though, I think that ship has sailed and they're going to try to walk it back.
1678974	1679774	I don't think I think
1681787	1695259	I think that that is because being that they're willing to make these types of changes without consulting the people actually using the service and working with developers, I just think it's too much for a lot of people.
1695259	1707110	I think that, yeah, a lot of developers don't want to lose that skill set that they've learned going forward, but certainly it's good to give them pause to any more
1708299	1717425	Games or whatever being developed with the platform like I think it's just they're really gonna look at porting stuff over I mean hell You know the folks with cold lamb.
1717425	1721107	There's him like yeah, we're gonna delete the game on January 1st.
1721107	1721307	Yeah
1723790	1729194	And no matter how much they dial back this decision at this point, like you said, the trust is gone.
1729194	1731075	The trust is evaporated.
1731075	1733357	People don't know.
1733357	1735098	People now know.
1735098	1743163	The ass and hole at Unity have been shown, with the pants pulled down, what is motivating the decisions at Unity.
1743163	1743944	That's the problem.
1745706	1747528	It has now all exposed.
1747528	1748810	It's all hanging out.
1748810	1753936	So now any developer working with you- They also tried like removing like some stuff on their end user license agreement too.
1753936	1763047	They like secretly back in April removed certain verbiage on there as well to try to allow them to do this, which is shady as well.
1763047	1763468	I don't know.
1763468	1765270	It's not good.
1765430	1775998	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I feel bad for the current students who have spent the last few years getting skills in Unity hoping to get a job in the game industry, only to find now that many devs are going to be going to a different engine.
1775998	1777999	Well, the good quote unquote news.
1777999	1783043	I mean, that's not good news, but the good there's a lot of people in the industry that are facing that question right now.
1783043	1790028	And there's going to be a lot of like, you know, I'm sure there were a lot of meetings this last week about should we pivot what engine we're going.
1790028	1792590	And I don't know if those decisions stop.
1792810	1799132	even when Unity reverses course, you know, especially when you've got an open source engine out there that looks mighty attractive right now.
1799132	1800012	It's the same thing.
1800012	1809074	It's very similar to Twitter, slowly and slowly and slowly dying and more people picking up alternatives, whether it be Blue Sky, Mastodon, or just fucking leaving social media.
1809074	1811735	Like it's, it's similar in some ways to that.
1811735	1817977	But back to the point that Bobby was making about the students, you have all of these coders at companies
1818497	1824565	who also are probably working in Unity and their skills are also going to have to be adapted.
1824565	1830992	So I don't think companies are going to necessarily be closed off just because you specialized in Unity.
1830992	1834617	They will have ways to help train individuals and
1834877	1838499	There's a certain brain and skill set that comes with programming.
1838499	1842921	I already know it's a skill set that I don't possess, and that's okay.
1842921	1845342	And there's still that.
1845342	1846982	So you know, there's what little hope there.
1846982	1859928	But my point is, is that those students are facing the same problems that employees already in the industry, and you know, people that run their own small gaming studios are also facing.
1859928	1862529	But now is the time to pivot.
1862529	1864390	And that's why Unity is fucked.
1867835	1869556	Yeah.
1869556	1871716	Mike def says video games were a mistake.
1871716	1873076	Nah, video games were a mistake.
1873076	1874397	I know why you're going with that comment.
1874397	1887120	But you know, when I play something like journey, and I'm well either either the 80s arcade version or the more modern whenever I play something like journey, whenever I play something like, I don't know, everybody's gone to the rapture.
1887120	1896583	Whenever I play a Dear Esther, whenever I play like a really artistic a game that makes a fucking point a game that has something to say, video games weren't a mistake.
1897625	1904009	Video game CEOs were a mistake.
1904009	1906931	Bobby Kotick was a mistake.
1906931	1909833	John Riccatello was a mistake.
1909833	1915756	Because where are all of these games that I'm talking about and hyping up, where are they coming from?
1915756	1917938	Smaller indie studios.
1917938	1924462	And for what it's worth, when these things all fall apart, it's the indies that end up rising up.
1927170	1927811	Uh, let's see.
1927811	1931194	Sturlock says I would put Lost Odyssey in that list as well.
1931194	1931815	Incredible story.
1931815	1934998	Yes, I'm sure I'm sure many of you have other games you would put in that list.
1934998	1938441	There's there's there's beautiful art out there in video games.
1938441	1941224	I understand what possessed death to say that comment.
1941224	1942405	But I do want to clarify.
1942405	1944567	I don't feel video games were a mistake.
1944567	1947050	Video game CEOs were a mistake.
1947050	1947210	Yeah.
1948368	1953450	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love the lead that Unity was hoping for was completely buried.
1953450	1959872	That they were making a lot of their AI tools part of the main personal license because it was getting paid for by these new fees.
1959872	1962934	They're like, we're providing these tools for free.
1962934	1966035	Yeah, but it's like ChatGPT inside the app.
1966035	1966775	Like, who cares?
1966775	1972157	Like, we don't need ChatGPT inside the app.
1972157	1974038	It's not anything, like, instrumental.
1975857	1976898	It's just not.
1976898	1977919	It really isn't.
1977919	1981481	We added AI is another boardroom buzzword that needs to die.
1981481	1982622	It's funny though.
1982622	1984924	It's like the AI inside of Unity.
1984924	1989967	Someone asked it like, Hey, Unity is, you know, proposing this type of change.
1989967	1993109	What, what do you think of pros or cons of that?
1993109	1996792	It totally said, this is a terrible idea.
1996792	1998933	They shouldn't do this.
1998933	2000454	Which I thought was funny.
2000454	2002256	Good AI.
2002256	2002936	All right.
2002936	2004137	Anything else on this topic?
2006125	2009268	Um, no, not, I mean, not really.
2009268	2010850	I guess we'll see how it falls out.
2010850	2012872	I mean, honestly, it's going to be busy next week.
2013886	2018269	Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what they do to try to walk it back.
2018269	2020150	But like, I don't know if it's going to be enough.
2020150	2022951	Like, honestly, I think it has eroded.
2022951	2026873	Like, this is like the last straw because this isn't like the only thing that they've done that's been negative.
2026873	2032116	There's been a lot of changes that they've made that haven't been popular with developers.
2032116	2035798	Now this they're like, oh, hey, you know, you're going to pay us all of this money.
2035798	2039640	It's like, no, no, I don't think I will.
2041768	2055238	Stirlock in chat also points out over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, like I pointed out on Bobby's show, I'm also pretty sure them not disclosing how they can tell legit from non-legit installs is a huge violation of GDPR laws in the EU.
2055238	2057399	Fantastic, fabulous.
2057399	2061422	John Riccatello has pissed off not just the American courts, but the British ones as well.
2061422	2062222	Let's fucking go.
2063123	2063984	Well, there is there.
2063984	2067367	So there was a from Sheridan's interactive game.
2067367	2072552	Sorry, I misspoke because EU is sorry, because there's actually a very famous.
2072552	2073513	Anyway, sorry.
2073513	2074394	So there was.
2074394	2075375	I'm heated.
2075375	2076156	It's cooking my brain.
2077466	2087051	This was from their legal counsel, I think had proposed like some of the three, they said three things immediately come to mind as far as like legal risk.
2087051	2092513	One of those is an abuse of dominant position, therefore very likely to engage in unfair competition.
2092513	2093634	Usually I'm into that.
2095085	2110525	Both sides of the Atlantic said it's highly likely competition in markets authority, UK, European Commission and Department of Justice US would be materially concerned about the situation and undertaking with a dominant position in the market like Unity.
2111325	2114887	Making unilateral decisions, pricings, conditions, where there are provisions.
2114887	2120529	Middleware, especially in mobile, is a vital component to many game businesses.
2120529	2130854	Also, they said that it might also invoke the UK and EU's platform business regulation, which governs the balance of power between platforms and businesses.
2132923	2142190	Yeah, so and of course, yeah, back to how is Unity going to figure out whether something is installed or not?
2142190	2144572	And whether that's legit or not?
2144572	2148334	They said that they had an algorithm that to figure that out.
2148334	2159342	I don't think that they because originally it was like, okay, well, literally, literally saying AI AI's got us, they're gonna AI is gonna guess is gonna make an estimate.
2159342	2160183	So it's
2163040	2164721	So is it not doing an accurate count?
2164721	2165861	Is it just guessing?
2165861	2167042	Or is it phoning home?
2167042	2182308	Which, if it's phoning home, then it's going to, you know, violate something with, I'm assured, the EU, with, you know, the GDPR or whatever, because you're sending data to some place, you know, they regulate all that.
2182308	2189271	So, and then once again, you know, they were like, well, there's not, we have ways of detecting pirated software.
2190058	2191939	But we can't tell you what those are.
2191939	2196442	And we'll we'll just work with you, you know, counts one, two, and three that you read there.
2196442	2198244	Hold his ass accountable.
2198244	2200305	I want to see Jon Rickettell in a courtroom.
2200305	2202026	It is about fucking time.
2202026	2207130	A CEO fucking gets gets the book thrown at him.
2207130	2208190	I hope it happens.
2208190	2210112	I really do.
2210112	2210652	Yeah, hopefully.
2211746	2217895	Anyway, let's move on to more pleasant news and talk about video games that we've been playing this week, whether they were in Unity or not.
2217895	2218816	Loki, let's go to you.
2218816	2219818	How was your gaming week?
2219818	2220959	And was it?
2220959	2224625	I mean, you put that Minecraft video out on Monday, so surely you played something else this week.
2225442	2226162	Yep, Minecraft.
2226162	2227984	I played more Minecraft this week.
2227984	2229465	I did not play anything else this week.
2229465	2233787	No, I've been trying to catch up because I still am behind even though I did have the video out.
2233787	2235268	That's the end of season two.
2235268	2236209	We're on season three.
2236209	2238230	We started it almost a month ago.
2238230	2242553	And so I'm trying to get my first episode done.
2242553	2245435	Mainly right now I've been designing my starter base, which
2246335	2253642	Unfortunately, you know, I've been saying, oh, hey, I'm going to, you know, let's not go so complicated and big.
2253642	2255544	Yeah, I'm totally ignoring all that.
2255544	2257966	Like, it's just, it's a large build.
2257966	2260288	It's a starter base.
2260288	2263852	But I have been doing stuff on the server, so I just need to, at some point, probably at the end of this week,
2265500	2267281	cut together a video and put it together.
2267281	2269703	I think I've got enough for about like two episodes already.
2269703	2272646	So I just need to, you know, sit down and edit.
2272646	2275608	I just want to give myself a break since it's been a month of editing.
2275608	2279431	So Ben and then today we did the live stream day.
2279431	2282834	So we had our first stream day of the season and that was fun.
2282834	2286317	We were killing dragons all day long and doing other weird things.
2286317	2287237	So it was a lot of fun.
2287237	2287918	Yeah.
2289145	2290605	All right, my game of the week.
2290605	2292886	So I played a couple things this week.
2292886	2298427	I checked out Baldur's Gate 3 actually finally after all this time and people talking about the game.
2298427	2303729	Shane was like, hey, we should do like a multiplayer thing and you could stream it and we can like, you know, keep doing it every week.
2303729	2305829	I was like, that actually sounds like a lot of fun.
2305829	2308810	And the bits and pieces I've seen in Baldur's Gate 3 kind of lends itself to that.
2308810	2309730	Yeah, let's do it.
2309730	2314932	So on Monday, we streamed several hours of Baldur's Gate 3 and we started a new campaign.
2314932	2315752	And there are
2315932	2322035	I can see why people are really into this game because it, you know, has a very complex character creator to it.
2322035	2324737	I'm playing like a Dragon Scale person.
2324737	2328919	I can see where people who are into D&D really like this.
2328919	2341826	And I know the roots of Baldur's Gate are in D&D, and so I'm being a little bit, you know, repetitive, but like the way it kind of plays out with how the narrator describes things down to the dice roll, like it feels like you're playing
2342766	2349471	a D&D game but the computer is facilitating that and that that's really cool and I see why people are into that.
2349471	2363302	I was a little shocked and annoyed at some of the difficulty that goes in with that because so there's this part anyone who was watching my stream knows exactly what happened there was this part where we got to a church and I don't know what had happened in the story but I was like oh
2364142	2368486	I feel like we need to go into this church because something had been said like we need to go in here.
2368486	2372610	And I was like, Oh, there's like a little stone slab that looks kind of loose there.
2372610	2375472	And Shane was like, Oh, you want to get rid of that stone slab?
2375472	2378515	He's been very big on you're gonna make all the decisions.
2378515	2378895	Okay.
2378895	2380476	And, and he was like, here.
2380476	2381838	Oh, you want to get rid of that stone slab here?
2381838	2382898	Let me go take care of that for you.
2382898	2384039	And he takes care of the stone slab.
2384039	2386742	And I was like, All right, well, then I guess we're going down there.
2387702	2393286	And we go down there and we are like instantly murdered by a group of high level characters.
2393286	2398650	And I was frustrated a lot because we hadn't saved our game in like, I don't know, 30 minutes.
2398650	2399891	So we had to go back and replay it.
2399891	2401552	I was like, Shane, you fucking got us killed.
2401552	2404074	And he's like, but I said, you're the one in charge.
2404074	2405335	And you're the one that made a decision.
2405335	2410039	I'm like, you opened the hole and said, doesn't that look like a pretty hole?
2410039	2411520	Should we go in it?
2411520	2411720	Like,
2412801	2415124	You didn't use those words, that's what it felt like.
2415124	2421491	At least, Shane, if you're still out there, you could have said, hey, actually, when was the last time you saved the game?
2421491	2424975	Like, you didn't have to say, you better save before we go in there.
2424975	2427418	Or just, hey, when was the last time you saved the game?
2427418	2428780	Oh, yeah, I should do that.
2428780	2430902	Then when we get killed, it would have been a lot less frustrating.
2431563	2437144	But lesson learned the hard way, you have to save now and save often type of thing.
2437144	2440645	So I won't be making that mistake again.
2440645	2447047	So once we spent 30 minutes getting caught up on everything that we lost, we were able to move forward again.
2447047	2448407	And yeah, it was it was interesting.
2448407	2450148	It feels like it's very slow going.
2450828	2452910	But so are most D&D campaigns.
2452910	2456592	And like, you know, obviously, there's a lot of freedom to choose different answers.
2456592	2465699	I thought it was fucking rad that like, you can take an animal ability, like an ability to talk to animals and like the animals actually talk.
2465699	2467780	Oh, yeah, and Shane killed my cat.
2467780	2469942	That also pissed me off.
2469942	2471383	Well, he did it because
2473082	2475465	I hit him with something, but he deserved it.
2475465	2478428	I don't remember what he did, but I know he deserved it.
2478428	2480170	So then he decided to kill my cat.
2480170	2485435	So we were already weak going into this battle with the higher level characters.
2485435	2485836	But anyway.
2486940	2515477	tune in for more adventures of us screaming at each other on Mondays until until we get to that point where I get so fucking annoyed I'm like we're not doing this again switch games because Shane has already said we're also Shane's already decided this we're also going to go back and play Pokemon Scarlet Violet because I never finished it but we're going to play a multiplayer so I can get to the DLC as well so that is also coming in the future after we finish Baldur's Gate 3 in like nine months if we're doing it once a week so
2516694	2521622	Anyway, Baldur's Gate 3 fun, but annoying when it comes to the difficulty.
2521622	2522885	I was not prepared for that.
2522885	2528835	So I'm warning all of you save after every battle save after every conversation save
2530025	2533407	Anyway, um, let's see other stuff that I played this week.
2533407	2535288	So a lot of the same stuff.
2535288	2538430	Diablo 4, I'm still playing the season of Diablo 4.
2538430	2544033	It seems like half the internet's moved on, but I am up to like battle pass tier 87.
2544033	2548936	So once I get to 90, I have finished Diablo 4 season one, essentially.
2548936	2552498	I mean, I didn't get my character to level 100, but there's nothing left to unlock.
2552498	2559482	So that's that's where I'm going to kind of end Diablo 4 season one and go play something else.
2560516	2564099	Um, also, I've been playing, you know, some mobile games.
2564099	2567802	I've been playing Pikmin, had a community day and I've been playing Pokemon Go.
2567802	2571325	I hit level 46 in Pokemon Go.
2571325	2585137	And I checked out this week, which just released Monster Hunter now, which is Niantic's newest game that's in partnership with Capcom, the license holders to Monster Hunter, their logos right there on the front page.
2585137	2587920	And I was checking the game out and I gotta say,
2588700	2590141	It's pretty polished.
2590141	2593882	I guess it was in beta for a while.
2593882	2598243	I was not expecting a Niantic game to be that smooth on release because they never are.
2598243	2608607	So I don't know if Capcom held them to a certain standard that Niantic was like, fine, I guess we got to make sure the game doesn't have bugs or, you know, every game has bugs, but you know.
2610368	2611930	It plays really smooth.
2611930	2616936	It doesn't randomly crash or really get a lot of frame rate skipping.
2616936	2620360	So I'm pretty impressed at Monster Hunter now.
2620360	2627208	I also think it's interesting that it uses the Pokestop Network, the stuff from Niantic Wayfarer, as stuff in it.
2627208	2629010	But it's stuff that's like
2629996	2636701	It's extra material, but like, if you don't have any near you, your progress in the game isn't really hindered.
2636701	2642886	Because the spawns of the monsters and random stuff in the overworld is actually very random.
2642886	2647329	So I think they're trying to figure out a way on how to make the game fun in rural areas.
2647329	2651372	And even though I don't live in a rural area, I think it might be working.
2651372	2656976	Like, I don't feel like I'm going by the parks with all the pokestops as frequently when I'm playing Monster Hunter now.
2656976	2658978	The only thing about Monster Hunter now is that
2659912	2668635	like moving around and all of that, it, it doesn't seem as helpful as in other games.
2668635	2673976	And I wonder how long Niantic is going to be able to put up with that because it's a direct conflict with their mission statement.
2673976	2680618	Because honestly, if you load the game every hour where you are, the environment will change and there'll be some new monsters there.
2680618	2683119	So you kind of don't have to move.
2683119	2685300	I mean, there's better stuff if you do move.
2685880	2687860	But you don't have to.
2687860	2689381	So that's kind of interesting.
2689381	2691341	Okay, Shane says it still sucks in rural.
2691341	2694222	My bad, but I see random stuff all over the place.
2694222	2697602	Maybe it's based off the XM or whatever.
2697602	2702444	Shane also says that Monster Hunter now is so far really decent to kind of fun.
2702444	2705884	It feels more active than any of the other games from Niantic I've played.
2705884	2709065	And yeah, I would also say that like, honestly, um,
2710551	2721184	I got into like battles like tapping it's it's very fluid and you dodge and it feels like it feels smooth like Pokemon gyms ought to be but Pokemon go is like six years old at this point.
2721184	2725289	So it's almost like you see how far we've come at this point with the technology and everything.
2725289	2727793	And the best part is I played with friends.
2728253	2730234	So you can actually hunt together.
2730234	2739621	And I was with some of my friends from, uh, when I was playing Ingress and all that, we were, you know, hanging out over the weekend, we went to brunch and we were like, Ooh, let's all fight a monster together.
2739621	2742183	And you scan a QR code on the phone.
2742183	2745205	And so three of us all took on a monster together.
2745205	2746826	And it was actually super fun.
2746826	2751689	Like it doesn't last very long, but it was like, wow, that actually is like really fluid and kind of neat.
2751689	2754992	And so I wonder what will happen with the four and five star bosses.
2754992	2755192	So.
2755732	2756893	I don't know.
2756893	2757873	I think it's neat.
2757873	2762475	I don't know if I'm... I will see how long it sustains itself.
2762475	2771320	There's still these story quests I'm going through, and I'm probably motivated to open it at least once, maybe twice a day, so we'll see how long that holds out, but like, I don't know.
2772162	2775183	There's only there's only so many GPS games I can play at once.
2775183	2782247	And I'm kind of back into Pokemon Go even though yes, on one hand, I'm sitting here going Niantic annoys the fuck out of me.
2782247	2790150	On the other hand, I can also recognize, but I walked 10,000 steps to get today to finish four routes and get a badge in a video game.
2790150	2793512	So I'm just I'm just I'm just keeping it free to play.
2793512	2795313	That's that's how I'm just keeping it free to play.
2795313	2797314	I don't need to spend money on anything.
2797314	2800335	And that's what I just I just don't need to spend the money.
2802692	2806838	Anyway, Shane says, I wonder if the QR codes work over distance.
2806838	2807900	They don't.
2807900	2808902	I tried.
2808902	2811025	My friend and I tried over telegram.
2811025	2813428	He sent me a QR code and I put it on my screen.
2813428	2814790	It didn't work.
2814790	2816313	So you do have to be somewhat close by.
2818556	2820817	All right, that's really it for my gaming week.
2820817	2824638	So let's get into some more news.
2824638	2830760	I also want to give a plug real quick, though, to our YouTube channel over at youtube.com slash VOG Network.
2830760	2834581	We're about to talk a little bit about the Nintendo Direct that happened this week.
2834581	2838822	But there was a YouTube earlier this week, a little more immediate to try to get the jump on it.
2839482	2849046	Shane and I sat down and talked a little bit about the Nintendo Direct and some impressions, but obviously I'm more than happy to repeat some of my thoughts, and things have marinated a little bit over the past couple days, so some things have shifted.
2849046	2853608	But Loki, why don't you walk us through what happened with the Nintendo Direct this week?
2853608	2861592	Yeah, lots of different games they showed off, some we knew were coming, some we didn't know, a lot of Mario stuff.
2862294	2865597	because Mario is certainly popular, especially with the movie and everything.
2865597	2867299	I didn't notice the Mario overload.
2867299	2867719	Is that weird?
2867719	2870321	Like, I just kind of expect like, of course, there's a lot of Mario games.
2870321	2871803	There always has been.
2871803	2873384	Where the hell have you all been?
2873384	2883493	Like, I mean, it does seem like there's been a bit of a lack in a year where we had the movie, but OK, I guess maybe, you know, COVID production slowed everything down.
2883493	2884274	A lot of remakes.
2884274	2885115	We're still seeing that.
2885115	2885315	Yeah.
2885879	2888541	A lot of remakes, remasters coming out.
2888541	2889221	Yeah, for sure.
2889221	2891343	That is one thing.
2891343	2902611	So some of the stuff we saw on the show off some more footage for Splatoon 3 Inkopolis and the side order expansion pass, which is going to be like a roguelike single player mode in Splatoon 3.
2902611	2904893	A little better than the first tease, that's for sure.
2905488	2906149	That is true.
2906149	2910092	The first one's like, what is this?
2910092	2914176	Mario versus Donkey Kong is now coming out on the Switch.
2914176	2916718	I think that was originally on the 3DS.
2916718	2918239	Game Boy Advance, actually.
2918239	2918900	Game Boy Advance?
2918900	2919881	Oh, wow.
2919881	2921462	I thought I actually owned it.
2921462	2922483	It's a cute game.
2922483	2922803	Yeah.
2922803	2923684	Yeah.
2923684	2924545	That's coming out February 16th.
2924545	2926707	I think they had a version of it on 3DS as well.
2927427	2928848	Okay.
2928848	2932970	Maybe I was thinking of Mario vs. Donkey Kong March of the Minis, I think might have been one.
2932970	2937392	Yes, there was like a sequel or something that was on 3DS.
2937392	2938233	Yeah.
2938233	2940934	Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown.
2940934	2945456	We've already seen this before, but that's been confirmed for January 18th on the Switch as well.
2945456	2946977	That also looks pretty good.
2946977	2948478	Looks very Metroidvania, Prince of Persia.
2948478	2948838	I'm into it.
2949973	2953496	Horizon Chase 2 Super Crazy Rhythm Castle November 14
2964965	2972672	That was the Konami one that like has obviously it leans on some of the very strong Konami music library, you know, things from Castlevania.
2972672	2977597	So you could see like Bloody Tears in the screenshot, but also some Bomani songs.
2977597	2980539	So it's it was like when I when I saw the trailer, I was like,
2981300	2995669	You know, if they were always talking about how do we make pop and music appealing to a US audience, even though there are tons of people here that are into pop and music, but fine, they want to figure out a way like beat and groovy ain't fucking it.
2995669	3003254	And yes, I'm gonna I'm gonna harp on a Xbox 360 arcade game for many, many years ago, because it was that fucking bad that I still remember it.
3003254	3009077	This on the other hand, as far as like falling notes in the three or five different lanes kind of look like expanded.
3009077	3009918	I was like, Oh, that looks kind
3009938	3016883	Yeah, we had a game called the Spy X Family Anime Series, or it's based off of that, Spy X Anya Operation Memories, which is like a photo diary game.
3016883	3017603	I'm not sure what that's about.
3039850	3041251	Cool.
3041251	3046974	We got some more footage of Super Mario RPG, the remake that's coming out on November.
3046974	3060143	They talked about how that there's going to be like a boss rush mode in there that kind of reminded me of the hidden battle, the hidden Final Fantasy thing, which they did show off a teaser of that, like with the door and everything.
3060143	3064225	So it looks like they're going to be doing some interesting stuff with that, which is kind of cool.
3064225	3068768	And then there's some new like powers, I guess.
3069595	3072997	where you can combine the three characters together and do a group attack.
3072997	3080840	And then also if you've timed your attacks well enough, then you'll hit all of the enemies, kind of an area effect attack, which is kind of neat.
3080840	3083382	And people are like, is that going to be like really overpowering?
3083382	3084902	Or is it rebalanced?
3084902	3086003	Or we kind of don't know.
3086003	3094006	It might be something that you can toggle to, like that may be their way of like making it like easier, I guess, for like people coming into it.
3094006	3094347	Who knows?
3095527	3108651	We've got, there was a trailer for another code, Recollection, which is an enhanced edition of a DS game, Trace Memory, and another code, R. That's coming out January 19th.
3108651	3113873	Princess Peach Showtime, that is the Princess Peach game that they had hinted at.
3113873	3120875	It looks like it's taking place on a stage, and she's got the Final Fantasy X-2.
3120875	3122295	Yeah, Dressphere.
3122295	3123916	Dressphere stuff, so that's kind of neat.
3123916	3124476	Looks cool, though.
3125256	3149808	I also like what I liked about the Princess Peach game is that it looks like it really is kind of its own universe where it's like there's these there's these new characters you haven't seen before it's a new kind of a blended art style of sorts of the 2D Mario games and maybe the Yoshi games which started as a Super Mario World 2 but anyway like I it kind of has its own unique sort of art style and I like that I like that Princess Peach is kind of getting her own universe because Luigi has Luigi's
3149908	3150228	Banshee
3174911	3176393	Yeah, look cool.
3176393	3178755	That's coming out in March on the 22nd.
3178755	3182619	We had Saga Emerald Beyond, which is releasing in 2024.
3182619	3186103	Yay, a Saga game.
3186103	3190367	Look how excited I am.
3190367	3195612	Tomb Raider 1, 2, and 3 are being remastered like the original Tomb Raiders, which
3196885	3201387	They're slightly better looking slightly just ever so slightly.
3201387	3202467	And that's coming out.
3202467	3204468	I'm not sure who asked for this, but OK.
3204468	3211050	I mean, I think it's funny that you can play as the original Lara Croft sprite that is all speaking of things that have not aged well.
3211050	3219714	But what's funny is that because they kind of have to follow the original sprites sort of shape, probably to do that HD remaster.
3219714	3223475	The new model doesn't look great either, but it's an improvement.
3224297	3232740	Yeah, we have a new trailer for Detective Pikachu Returns that's coming out in October 6.
3232740	3237922	Trombone Champ is getting its Nintendo Switch debut.
3237922	3244505	It's coming to consoles and with four player local co-op and a bunch of different motion controls for it as well.
3244505	3246306	And not a single Nintendo song.
3246306	3246526	What?
3248140	3249701	Missed Opportunity.
3249701	3252643	Yeah, I think I agree.
3252643	3256725	I think the motion controls look silly, but the four player mode is people are going to enjoy.
3256725	3260988	I was kind of like Trombone Champ kind of feels like that joke from six months ago.
3260988	3268012	I'm not sure if there's still a clamoring for it, but I think the multiplayer mode, I think that'll sell some copies.
3268012	3269353	Yeah.
3269353	3270193	Battle Crush.
3270193	3275676	It's a free to play online battle royale game that's coming out spring of 2024.
3278087	3282570	Medieval Open World Tactical Role Playing Game War Tales Contra Operation Galuga Reimagining of Contra Arcade
3298360	3300221	It certainly looks better than that 3DS release.
3315287	3316688	Thanks for watching!
3329697	3333840	Yeah, because Konami is not the one making them.
3333840	3336001	Has something changed to Konami?
3336001	3342485	Because, you know, between this and some of the other things that people like, you know, we know we got Suikoden remasters that people have been asking for forever on the way.
3342485	3345487	Those Castlevania collections were pretty good.
3345487	3348269	The remaster of Snake Eater and stuff like that.
3348269	3354353	I think what it is is that they're taking their licenses and giving them the competent studios instead of trying to build them in-house.
3354393	3360894	It's almost like they listened to the advice that people were saying, like, God, I wish Konami would just give their IPs to people that can do things with them.
3360894	3362015	And they are.
3362015	3368556	And now that like that's happening, it's like, oh, like, actually, this all looks pretty cool.
3368556	3371596	I have to say the Contra game looks great.
3371596	3377498	And the the Super Beat Adventure, whatever that one was called, looks really cool, too.
3377498	3378918	So it's like, OK,
3379938	3383360	I didn't know I'd be praising Konami ever again on this show, but here we are.
3383360	3387642	Like, it's a direction I'm kind of into.
3387642	3389223	Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.
3389223	3393526	I hope that does come to other platforms, because I don't want to play it on Switch, but I will.
3393526	3398308	I will play it on PC for sure.
3398308	3405032	Unicorn Overlord, which is a... Oh, I'm... Let's see here.
3405032	3406253	It comes out March 8th, 2024.
3408696	3414138	Unicorn Overload look nothing like the name you would expect.
3414138	3417499	Yeah, it looks like a tactical look.
3417499	3421601	I don't know, like a Nobunaga ambition tactical type of thing.
3421601	3426163	But it was Yeah, I don't spot any unicorns at all in this.
3426163	3428184	No, that must be the troop name or something.
3428184	3430224	I don't know.
3430224	3434886	Yeah, Orange Ray does say that Contra is bound for PS5, Xbox and Steam.
3434886	3435746	So there you go.
3435746	3436747	Nice.
3436747	3436927	Nice.
3437835	3447097	And then back on the remake train again, but Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is getting put on the Switch as well.
3447097	3448978	So it's a remake of that game.
3448978	3455439	Also includes the four-player co-op as well, and that's coming out summer of next year.
3455439	3465882	And then I think this was the rumor we talked about last year, but F-Zero 99 was something that they teased or showed off, I guess, and that came out that same day.
3465882	3467142	And it is F-Zero.
3467602	3470265	Thank you for watching!
3491164	3510796	Yeah, like, I don't know, they're saying it looks a little chaotic for me, but at the same time, I'm kind of like, oh, but they like they went in and they made the Super Nintendo version of the game like HD and widescreen, you know, and they actually had to go in and alter the tracks to make it work for like 99 people kind of all funnel into the main raceway.
3510796	3513538	So it's not too chaotic at first.
3513538	3513618	Um,
3514338	3516419	I don't know, it's interesting.
3516419	3519621	You know, sure, I'm a little sad it's not the F-Zero GX port.
3519621	3521062	I've been begging for it for years.
3521062	3523223	Well, maybe we'll get that eventually.
3523223	3528846	I feel an obligation to go get this to show support for F-Zero.
3528846	3536610	Luckily, it's their game for the online service anyway, which I imagine most of you listening to this, if you're a Nintendo fan, you probably already have it.
3536610	3537470	So you know what?
3537470	3539351	Go download the game and play it a couple times.
3539351	3540072	Show Nintendo.
3540872	3543695	They can have more racing games than just Mario Kart.
3543695	3544515	It's OK.
3544515	3548118	You can have two successful racing franchises.
3548118	3550500	Ask Xbox, Forza, Forza Horizon.
3550500	3554864	It is OK to have two successful racing franchises.
3554864	3556766	Yeah.
3556766	3563151	We had a game called it looks like a spinoff of League of Legends, Bandle Tale, a League of Legends experience.
3564387	3569651	And it is going to be coming out next year as well.
3569651	3575655	Song of Nunu, the League of Legends story, yet another League of Legends game that is also coming out.
3575655	3578757	But this is a little bit earlier, on November 1st.
3578757	3581299	We got a new trailer for WarioWare Move It.
3582279	3583300	which looks interesting.
3583300	3589383	So we we knew it was kind of like another motion game before, but this one they have you doing different poses.
3589383	3592464	And with those poses, you have that's how you play the games, basically.
3592464	3596727	So they tell you like it's almost like a yoga pose that you get into, but not.
3596727	3598567	And then you play the game like that.
3598567	3601809	I love WarioWare.
3601809	3603330	This looks this is terrible.
3603683	3605724	And I didn't really care for smooth moves, honestly.
3605724	3609406	So I'm not into it at all.
3609406	3609786	Sorry.
3609786	3611527	It just it looks ridiculous.
3611527	3615229	It's probably I mean, it probably scratches the party game niche for a lot of people.
3615229	3616009	Cool.
3616009	3617770	I will not be buying.
3617770	3619471	Yeah.
3619471	3624473	We have Aya then Chronicles 100 Heroes that's out next year, April 23rd.
3624473	3626594	I will be buying.
3626594	3629816	Actually, I kickstarted it, so I get a copy from way back when.
3630613	3634736	Eastward Octopia Wargroove 2 coming out October 5th
3650192	3651272	This is pretty exciting.
3651272	3655053	Dave the Diver is getting a console release on October 26th.
3655053	3659334	That's a great game if you haven't played it yet.
3659334	3665496	They announced the final booster course pack for Mario Kart 8.
3665496	3668096	And they have new characters coming as well.
3668096	3671897	Funky Kong, Pauline, Peachette.
3671897	3673838	And that's coming out this holiday.
3675391	3679896	Among Us is getting a new map with the Fungal, and it looks kind of fun.
3679896	3688744	And then of course, last but not least, the big announcement was the remake remaster of Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door.
3688744	3689905	And that is coming out next year.
3690580	3694761	Yeah, a little bit unexpected but cool because I that is a fun game.
3694761	3695461	It's a good game.
3695461	3707424	So it's neat that it's I just would have thought with because those games always felt a little bit like what Super Mario RPG kind of so I kind of figured because we were getting Super Mario RPG, we weren't going to see those games for a minute.
3707424	3709025	But here we are.
3709025	3714666	So I mean, I hear I am bitching about two racing series, we can have two RPG series as well.
3714666	3717227	But it's just it's, it's neat.
3717227	3718187	It was a pleasant surprise.
3720281	3728484	I was hoping it would be like a collection of games like Paper Mario, Thousand Year Door and like maybe Super Paper Mario or something like that would have been kind of cool.
3728484	3734565	But you know, why sell you three when they can sell you three individually for three payments?
3734565	3738226	You know, it's like that's going to be the option they're going to choose, of course.
3738226	3739887	What did you think of the direct overall, Loki?
3740825	3741786	It was all right.
3741786	3742287	It was good.
3742287	3744590	I mean, there wasn't anything like I was super excited about.
3744590	3751279	I mean, it was all positive, though, like I didn't see anything like absolutely hated it, but it wasn't anything like, oh, my God, I got to buy that now, you know.
3752332	3761441	I was very surprised there wasn't a Metroid Prime 2 released, because I just figured they were going to piecemeal that trilogy out, and now's a good time for Metroid Prime 2.
3761441	3762602	Yeah, they still might, that's true.
3762602	3768467	Because there's still probably another direct before the end of the year, so they'll probably do another thing and they can announce that.
3768467	3775433	I think that came out originally around February, so maybe if they release it a year later, you know, then they could still announce that and release it.
3777246	3779307	I thought the direct was actually pretty good.
3779307	3783849	Bond Civilization VI has a stream in which Rob gives Konami some praise but has a bone to pick with Nintendo.
3783849	3785409	I always have bones to pick with Nintendo.
3785409	3790171	I love them, but, you know, we're critical of the art that we love.
3790171	3794533	And I will say overall, I thought Nintendo did do a pretty good job when you consider
3795552	3806908	If rumors are to be believed, which they probably are considering how much of this Direct leaked, because that, you know, Thousand Year Door remake leaked, F-099 leaked, which, you know, it is what it is in this industry.
3808958	3814222	My point is, if you believe in those sorts of rumors, then the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming next year.
3814222	3831516	So knowing that that's coming, and if you want to believe that it's coming like a March or April, sort of like before the end of the fiscal year, enough time for them to move a bunch of them before the end of the fiscal year, then obviously they're only going to show things up to the point where that comes out, and then it's about the releases that are coming out on that system, right?
3831516	3835599	So there's only like so much with that looming on the horizon.
3835599	3837441	And they were, by the way, folks,
3837841	3840843	They were never going to show the Switch 2 at this Direct.
3840843	3841543	Are you kidding?
3841543	3842024	No.
3842024	3847147	Why would they cannibalize holiday sales of the Switch?
3847147	3848367	Why would they do that?
3848367	3861175	They don't... You know, rumors are rumors, but they don't want you to believe that a Switch 2 is coming, because they still want you to buy the Nintendo Switch if you've got the money and a whole... Yeah, that won't be until like a January, February, and then launch in March.
3861175	3864417	It'll follow the pattern of the original Switch because it worked.
3865450	3868232	Um, so, um, you know, look forward to that.
3868232	3875999	But considering that is all on the horizon, I think that's, you know, I think the direct was as good as it could be.
3875999	3879402	S2100mat says, maybe we'll get a little glimpse of the Game Awards.
3879402	3882204	Nope, not till after the 25th.
3882204	3885827	I'd be I'd be shocked, but not till after the 25th.
3885827	3891612	Game Awards is gonna be wild this year anyway, with all the games that have come out, you know, that race for Game of the Year is gonna be off the hook.
3892445	3897512	So, um, so yeah, but overall, I thought the direct was was fine.
3897512	3901398	You know, especially when you consider that that's on the horizon.
3901398	3902600	It was it was good enough.
3904436	3913841	I think also I will say this, I thought one of the best things they did in that direct was at the very end before that thousand year door trailer.
3913841	3920625	They did a sizzle reel of like everything they showed in that direct, but they did it by release day.
3920625	3923367	And so they were like, here's what's coming in September.
3923367	3924688	Here's what else is coming in September.
3924688	3925508	Here's coming October.
3925508	3926529	Here's what else is coming.
3926529	3927549	November, November, December.
3927549	3933173	Then they were showing about two games a month on through what March of next year or so.
3933173	3933373	So
3934093	3948657	They definitely are kind of learning from what tanked them on the Wii U, is that these regular releases and the whole, you know, calendar or whatever, is a very good thing to do.
3948657	3954778	And to show, you know, again, to try to move Switches during the holiday, show that it's still being regularly supported.
3954778	3957699	I thought that was a very smart thing they did there at the end.
3957699	3962400	ZenMonkey11 in chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, is Switch 2 a fact?
3963488	3967910	Um, yes, PlayStation 6 is a fact.
3967910	3972192	A successor to the Xbox Series X is a fact.
3972192	3975173	There will be a successor console, the Nintendo Switch.
3975173	3976353	Absolutely.
3976353	3978654	What is a rumor is when.
3978654	3980875	And the rumor is that it's next year.
3980875	3984137	Now, everything kind of tracks for that.
3984137	3989059	So this rumor is kind of a little bit more on fire than most that you hear.
3989059	3991620	But it's when you say a fact,
3992818	3996805	It's release is not a fact yet, but it'll happen eventually.
3996805	3997946	Has to.
3997946	3998708	Yeah, of course.
3998708	3998848	Yeah.
4000088	4001209	All right.
4001209	4002670	And what dumb name will they give it?
4002670	4002950	Yeah.
4002950	4004251	Let's get started.
4004251	4006052	All right.
4006052	4011776	Speaking of things that are facts, poor investment calls from Square Enix, by golly.
4011776	4012456	Here we go again.
4012456	4023704	Apparently, according to a report from Bloomberg, so it is coming from another source, that they're apparently Final Fantasy 16 did not achieve the expected sales.
4023704	4024965	This is according to Bloomberg.
4025893	4037835	Two billion of its value has now been lost due to Final Fantasy 16, which received good reviews, but did not sell at the expectation levels because we know Square Enix always puts these really high expectations of sales.
4037835	4043116	Almost like if putting a game on one console is a bad idea.
4043116	4046017	Exactly that part, number one.
4046017	4053178	I hate this narrative that the fucking press is running with that Final Fantasy 16 is a flop.
4053178	4053398	Like,
4056667	4067355	Anyway, yeah, they either need to like, if they really thought that they were going to sell that amount, they need to forecast better because they're doing a poor job of forecasting.
4067355	4074300	And if that was the goal is they wanted to sell that many, then maybe don't sign into exclusive deals with Sony.
4074300	4082827	Maybe that's not lucrative enough for you that, you know, whatever money they're paying you to keep it one platform you could have made elsewhere.
4085031	4085432	and Will.
4091570	4096573	Apparently Forspoken, you know, that's where I'm like, this is where the two billion was lost.
4096573	4098634	It wasn't Final Fantasy 16, it was Forspoken.
4098634	4099635	That game bombed.
4099635	4100275	I'm sorry.
4100275	4101776	I know it has its fans.
4101776	4102757	I never played it.
4102757	4110241	I wasn't exactly motivated to spend that kind of money on a game that was, you know, getting a lukewarm reception.
4110241	4111902	So I guess maybe I'm part of the problem.
4111902	4112303	I don't know.
4112303	4120388	But also of note, Square Enix has mobile games that shut down when they didn't meet the expectations, such as Bravely Default, Brilliant Lights, Echoes of Mana,
4121088	4122969	Gone.
4122969	4132316	In a comment, Tokyo-based developer and gamer Michael Prefontaine said, Flooding the market with unfinished, bad, or untested games is a bad move.
4132316	4138480	Listing off Marvel's Avengers or Spoken and the Diofield Chronicle as examples of these games.
4138480	4142383	The company has overstretched itself on too many titles without proper oversight.
4142383	4144585	That I would agree with.
4144585	4145725	That I would agree with.
4145725	4147947	Those are all bombs.
4147947	4150048	Like the Marvel's Avengers
4151108	4155910	In what universe should that game ever have bombed the way it did?
4155910	4156491	Oops.
4156491	4164655	Well, it should have been a single player game that, you know, was the narrative single player game, like, say, the Guardians of the Galaxy game.
4164655	4171218	But then they're like, you know, what we could do is we could just say it's a live service and sell a bunch of game passes and stuff.
4171218	4173279	And we're going to make tons of money off of that.
4173279	4175060	And then everyone's like, but
4175580	4176961	But I didn't want to play that game.
4176961	4178642	I wanted to play this one.
4178642	4192411	And then even then, like, you know, hey, we're going to release Chocobo Racing, except we're going to make it, you know, we're going to make it like free to play or, you know, sell you a bunch of monetizations to it that you don't want.
4192411	4192571	Yeah.
4192571	4195913	It's like, well, can I just get the full game and play that?
4195913	4195993	No.
4196808	4203251	Um, Circan Toto, a Tokyo based industry consultant said Square Enix has problems with their games output.
4203251	4205612	Too many of the games are kind of conventional.
4205612	4210734	Those titles get a 70% rating on Metacritic are kind of okay, and are just very forgettable.
4210734	4215136	But see, that's what's what's wild that none of that is true about Final Fantasy 16.
4215136	4215817	So why rub?
4216877	4219400	I thought I thought they were investing in NFTs.
4219400	4221122	Didn't that turn the company around?
4221122	4222663	I thought it was supposed to be the big thing.
4222663	4227309	You'll notice that conversation fucking evaporated like quick.
4227309	4234376	So that's that's a done like we're not Square Enix is smart enough to not say that word ever again.
4234376	4235097	So there is that.
4237891	4240513	I don't know, like, you know, I feel like we have all this.
4240513	4247319	But then on the other hand, Square Enix is like Theatrhythm has sold a bunch of copies, the pixel remasters have done very well.
4247319	4249160	So there is, I don't know.
4249160	4252723	But I also understand that Square Enix wants to be more than Final Fantasy.
4252723	4262952	But I really think they need to be looking at the mid level titles, things like Octopath Traveler, Bravely Default, give us a fucking Chrono Trigger remake already.
4262952	4263933	Like, what?
4264942	4267144	You want a game that you know will make money?
4267144	4269326	Do it.
4269326	4271087	It's wild.
4271087	4271828	Oh, good point.
4271828	4276892	Mike Deftonchat calls out ChocoboGP, another turd.
4276892	4283057	But we're going to sell it like a regular game and then fill it with free to play on top of that.
4283057	4287240	Granted, that's all gone now, but ChocoboGP deserved a better release.
4287240	4289281	Absolutely.
4289281	4289602	Anyway.
4291640	4296987	I mean, technically, there's a new boss at Square Enix, but we're not seeing the change yet.
4296987	4298149	We'll see.
4298149	4299290	All right, moving on.
4299290	4307101	Loki, golly golly, as if Nintendo doing a direct wasn't enough, Sony was like, you gotta do what Nintendo does.
4307101	4307641	Forget about me.
4309227	4314791	Sony does what Nintendo.
4314791	4317373	Yes, they do.
4317373	4324657	So Sony decided to go ahead and do their state of play in which they showed off a few things, some a little bit smaller.
4324657	4330221	This interests me because I am a fan of Bennett Foddy's Getting Over It game.
4330221	4338507	So, of course, there's another frustratingly fun game to play called Baby Steps, where you control a guy's... It's almost like co-op, but not.
4338987	4354034	I have the control that his feet and try to traverse the minute I saw that trailer literally go to the video at VOG Network and watch what we said about this because I said this game looks fucking ridiculous I said but Loki is super gonna be into it
4355176	4357297	Exactly.
4357297	4358257	So yeah, it looks funny.
4358257	4363498	So that is going to be coming out at some point next summer.
4363498	4370180	And then, of course, the announcement that Roblox is coming to PlayStation as well, which is coming to the console.
4370180	4376762	And it also came to the MetaQuest, which my son actually wanted me to get for him on the MetaQuest.
4376762	4380203	But because it's VR, they don't let you use VR unless you're over 13.
4380203	4381804	So he could not play it.
4382954	4393639	By the way, I know a lot of people are like big fucking deal about Roblox on PlayStation, but Roblox is like actually extremely popular with a certain group.
4393639	4396141	I mean, yeah, it is.
4396141	4401143	It is kind of irritating, but it is like it is a platform where you can make a lot of different things.
4401143	4405125	And yeah, a lot of the content is kind of trash, but it's trash that my kids play like.
4406302	4407403	Literally all day every day.
4407403	4410545	A lot of content on YouTube is trash, but we all keep watching it.
4410545	4412607	I don't know what to tell you.
4412607	4414988	They find entertainment in it.
4414988	4420392	They literally, they play a game where they DJ in like a club type thing and they like...
4421588	4424110	do that and people like tip them or something.
4424110	4424530	I don't know.
4424530	4424850	It's weird.
4424850	4430214	Somebody told me about Total Drama Island, which is like Survivor, but it's on Roblox.
4430214	4431735	That sounds awesome.
4431735	4432996	Total Drama Island.
4432996	4433416	I love that.
4433416	4434617	That should be just a show.
4436558	4460781	no well you know anything's possible you know milf island from 30 rock like legit became a show like it's not called that but it's it's it's the premise of milf island which if you've never seen that parody on 30 rock funniest fucking survivor parody because it was 30 rock that show is brilliant so it's just like you know what was it janine we do not want to hit that get off of milf island it's so good
4463650	4465255	a show in Roblox?
4473060	4475360	Whatever, I thought it was the thing that was associated with Roblox.
4475360	4476081	That sounds awesome, though.
4476081	4477941	All right, whatever.
4477941	4484282	They showed off footage of Ghostbusters Rise of the Ghost Lord, which was for PlayStation VR 2.
4484282	4487083	So, hey, they remembered that VR exists.
4487083	4491703	Also showed off the VR mode for Resident Evil 4.
4491703	4496064	And that is going to be coming, I guess, September 21st.
4496064	4499545	So just in a week here or later this week, actually.
4500458	4506804	then is yelling at me that Total Drama Island is actually a TV show that's on HBO Max.
4506804	4515913	I'm crossing my wires then I swear to God there's some Roblox clone that is a survivor thing that is like drama or whatever.
4515913	4519397	It is not the same thing as this show.
4519397	4522440	But now that I know about this show, I do think it's kind of funny.
4522440	4524602	So I guess I'll have to add it to my list.
4525376	4526877	Is it a cartoon?
4526877	4528779	It looks like a cartoon.
4528779	4529500	Let's hold it.
4529500	4531542	Total Drama Island.
4531542	4535626	They had a show called Total Drama at one time.
4535626	4539109	OK, so it's it is a show called Total Drama.
4539109	4540390	OK.
4540390	4541531	Neat.
4541531	4543513	Watch it.
4543513	4544894	It's like an animated survivor.
4544894	4544994	OK.
4547645	4548545	What else?
4548545	4554506	So we had, uh, they showed off, uh, Avatar, the new game, Last Letter, Airbender.
4554506	4557507	I was at Avatar Frontiers, the Pandora.
4557507	4560888	That's coming out in December.
4560888	4562768	And what else?
4562768	4568910	Like, even though I'm sure the game is going to be basic as fuck, like, it's a movie game.
4568910	4569670	It's Ubisoft.
4569670	4570190	It's going to be basic.
4570890	4573252	Ghost Riders 2 will begin in a demo at the end of October on the 26th.
4591283	4591663	Let's see.
4591663	4592324	Oh, I'm sorry.
4592324	4594405	It's coming out October 26th.
4594405	4597187	It's getting a demo before that.
4597187	4604391	We have the Deep Earth Collection, which is more colors coming to the PlayStation 5.
4604391	4607093	So they're going to have red, white, and blue.
4607093	4610035	I don't know how that's the Deep Earth Collection.
4610035	4614818	That's very patriotic of them.
4614818	4616679	I do not like the colors of those.
4616679	4618260	White's fine.
4618260	4619561	I thought they already had a white console.
4620865	4625327	But the blue and red are not, they don't look very good.
4625327	4625807	Oh, I'm sorry.
4625807	4629949	Volcanic red, cobalt blue, and sterling silver.
4629949	4632731	That looks white.
4632731	4634392	It's not chromy enough to be silver.
4634392	4634892	Sorry.
4634892	4637853	It's like a weird finish, but it looked pretty.
4637853	4639394	They all look pretty, I gotta say.
4639394	4643956	But I don't know if I would spend money to customize this box that sits on my shelf.
4643956	4645437	But the controllers look pretty.
4645437	4646898	Yeah.
4646898	4647378	I was into it.
4648529	4651911	Helldivers 2 is going to be coming out February 8th now.
4651911	4655132	It's been delayed from this year.
4655132	4662175	Marvel's Spider-Man 2, they showed off some trailer of that, showing off some of the open world stuff with that.
4662175	4664976	It looks very cool.
4664976	4667977	I think that game is going to sell oodles and oodles.
4667977	4669778	Exactly.
4669778	4674820	Tales of Arise is going to be getting an expansion called Beyond the Dawn.
4674820	4676221	And that is coming out November 9th.
4678976	4680103	Honkai Soul Rail
4682094	4683915	that's going to be coming out October 11th.
4683915	4686256	I didn't realize that wasn't already on PlayStation, to be honest.
4686256	4686816	I thought it was.
4686816	4690857	There's a lot of these games are just on PC and mobile and stuff.
4690857	4695459	Foam Stars, which is by Square Enix, they're getting an open beta later this month.
4695459	4696579	That looks kind of interesting.
4696579	4697260	September 29th.
4697260	4699841	I'm kind of surprised this is a Square Enix thing, though.
4699841	4702181	Kind of a rip off of Splatoon, but sure.
4702181	4707543	It is, but they kind of do something like if you look at it, it's like the heroes have different abilities, kind of like Overwatch.
4707543	4711545	It's kind of an interesting little mishmash of the formula.
4711545	4711705	Yeah.
4712557	4717400	And then finally a trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is coming out February 29th.
4717400	4718340	Looks fantastic.
4718340	4722482	They have like a $350 collector's edition.
4722482	4723422	Yeet.
4723422	4725664	Like that is ridiculous.
4725664	4730506	And clearly it's on two discs because you're going to need one disc to hold all those mini games.
4731785	4735008	But Andrea Rodea is apparently at the Gold Saucer now.
4735008	4740392	I love that they're finding ways to keep some of the great characters from the first part in the second part.
4740392	4742654	And that it looked really good.
4742654	4747638	They confirmed in a blog post that it ends with the sequence of events.
4748548	4753631	and I forget the name of the area, but it's in the original Final Fantasy VII where Aerith dies.
4753631	4761855	So they've confirmed, which I said a long time ago on this program, that is where the second game will end, with the quote-unquote Aerith death sequence.
4761855	4765257	But they didn't say, thank you, the Forbidden or Forgotten City.
4765257	4765938	Thank you.
4765938	4768759	They didn't say it ends with Aerith dying.
4768759	4777684	I mean, maybe they didn't want to spoil it, but you'll notice the words they chose left it open that Aerith maybe doesn't die.
4781515	4785617	but there's definitely there's definitely going to be a cliffhanger there.
4785617	4788138	Well, they already tried to kill.
4788138	4793841	Anyway, if you haven't played the first game yet, you probably should, because that was the first like, what the fuck moment?
4793841	4799944	But it was like, honestly, I was so into the plot of the first game and how they use that whole thing as a device.
4799944	4800805	So good.
4800805	4802586	So good.
4802586	4805767	I didn't like how they said that your saves don't transfer over.
4805767	4806748	That's kind of weird.
4806748	4807248	It is weird.
4807248	4810590	But yeah.
4810590	4810910	All right.
4812312	4814656	Yes, you're gonna have to start from square one.
4814656	4815257	I guess.
4815257	4816479	Yeah.
4816479	4818062	Typical square fashion, I guess.
4818062	4820245	So what'd you think of the Sony State of Play?
4820245	4821367	I did not watch it.
4821367	4821848	But oh,
4823516	4827959	I am looking forward to watching at least the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth trailer.
4827959	4830200	I need to play through VII.
4830200	4831480	I played through like the beginning of it.
4831480	4834322	I just never went back to it, but I need to play through it.
4834322	4838885	Now you can do what I did with Mass Effect and you just play them all back to back once they're all out.
4838885	4840205	Well, I guess there you go.
4840205	4843627	You'd have to wait for the third one to do that, but don't wait that long.
4843627	4844708	No, I don't want to.
4844708	4845028	Okay, good.
4846065	4849386	All right, let's see, moving right along.
4849386	4859811	Let's talk about, oh, a studio that I was speaking fondly of last week was Digital Eclipse because they made that Gold Master game, The Making of Karateka, which I was speaking highly of.
4859811	4864053	And, you know, there's a more in-depth look over on our YouTube channel, VOG Network.
4864053	4868655	Well, we got word about what Digital Eclipse's next game will be.
4868655	4871076	But it is not Gold Master series.
4871076	4873597	I was kind of surprised because this game would have been great for that.
4873597	4873817	But
4874437	4902096	um they are they must have just not had the library of material but they are gonna make wizardry uh specifically wizardry proving grounds of the mad overlord and it is now in early access uh right now apparently uh this was uh of course one of the very first computer rpgs that they had with a feature party based play it goes back to 1981 and i thought they stopped making wizardry games after wizardry 8
4903177	4911831	but boy when I said that in the discord server I got corrected real quick because apparently there have been wizardry games, spin-off games, and I guess wizardry is still kind of
4913087	4917009	Big question mark in Japan, because there's been so it's interesting.
4917009	4920952	So and apparently there's a lot of interesting issues going on with the rights and all that stuff.
4920952	4924794	But this remake has been in development for two years.
4924794	4928636	It is built on top of the original Apple twos game code.
4928636	4935540	And it is a full overhaul with a modernized visual presentation, a redesign interface, and all of that, which doesn't
4935860	4942545	Yeah, I mean, it doesn't really surprise me because, you know, the original Wizardry being on an Apple 2, it looks very old school.
4942545	4950890	And for those of you watching on YouTube, you can see it's that whole like green monitor, old ass Apple in the computer lab type of look.
4950890	4956474	But now that they have reimagined this game, it obviously looks very rendered.
4956474	4959416	And it's, you know, really it looks really cool.
4959416	4961057	So that's cool.
4961057	4963999	Yeah, I think I think I kind of want to check it out.
4963999	4964299	I do.
4965840	4971363	I wish they could remake something like Dragon Quest in this but they would never get the rights.
4971363	4973464	You think the rights to this were difficult to get?
4973464	4974284	Boy oh boy.
4974284	4979787	And I love that mode that they're showing in the trailer where it's the original Apple game on top of the new graphics.
4979787	4981768	I think that's so smart.
4981768	4984550	A way to kind of respect both games.
4984550	4986511	So kind of neat.
4986511	4989712	Bonds006 says could Oregon Trail ever come to modern consoles?
4989712	4990333	I believe it has.
4991532	4992393	Thank you for watching!
5008797	5011398	So, um, yeah, that looks, uh, it looks cool.
5011398	5012498	I have to check that out.
5012498	5013638	I guess it's in early access.
5013638	5023120	I could check it out now if I wanted to, but there's just so many games to play, including continuing my adventures in Starfield, which I think you want to talk about, Loki.
5023120	5031542	Yeah, so, uh, Starfield has, of course, hit Nexus mods and, you know, you can get all sorts of mods for, you know, a typical Bethesda game.
5031542	5034463	Which any Bethesda game you should expect, yes.
5034463	5035883	Any Bethesda game, yes.
5035883	5037184	I saw some thumbnails today.
5037184	5037504	I was like,
5038531	5043595	Not surprised, not surprised that that is one of the mods that's out there.
5043595	5058925	However, because the world is filled with a lot of whiny man babies that don't like things like pronouns, someone had gone out of their way to create a mod that removes the pronouns from Starfield.
5058925	5063769	And well, the folks at Nexus Mods are like, come on, what are you doing?
5063769	5064730	Like, seriously.
5064730	5068072	And so they removed the mod and they're like, well, if you don't like it,
5068886	5069967	Bye bye.
5069967	5070707	Good for them.
5070707	5074570	They were like, we're not going to miss the trash that leaves this site because we did this.
5074570	5076031	Like, good for them.
5076031	5078132	Like, props to Nexus Mod.
5078132	5082055	They basically said it's certainly within our rights not to host content on our platform.
5082055	5083095	That's right.
5083095	5087598	And, you know, First Amendment does not apply to our website.
5087598	5088499	Exactly.
5088499	5097725	And they said that believes in diversity and inclusion and the removal of diversity while appealing to many does not promote a positive modding community.
5098982	5099582	Great.
5099582	5102523	I stand behind that for sure.
5102523	5103543	It's also stupid.
5103543	5106984	Like, it's funny because- Did you hear the punchline about this mod?
5106984	5108945	Because there's a punchline about this whole thing.
5108945	5110425	Somebody brought it up in Discord.
5110425	5113086	Here's I think it was- Oh, here's the punchline.
5113086	5123188	Apparently with that mod, because it's deleting that, you know, section in there, and it basically makes that flag is not set when you make your character.
5123188	5125629	Everybody is non binary when you use that mod.
5126069	5134171	Well, but your character is immediately non-binary and we'll use they them pronouns because you did not change your pronouns to something else.
5134171	5139733	So by using that mod, you are electing to be non-binary in that game.
5139733	5143394	And I think that's the chef's kiss part of that.
5143394	5144934	That's just fantastic.
5144934	5145554	That's great.
5145554	5150556	Be sure to go comment that on all of the YouTube videos of people that are running that mod.
5150556	5151476	Be sure to, you know,
5152509	5157834	Well, yeah, I saw the like, I mean, the video that's been going around about not do not go to their YouTubes, do not give them clicks.
5157834	5159035	They do not deserve it.
5159035	5161237	Striker, I said, I'm just speaking.
5161237	5171127	I was going to say like the whole I saw the whole rant regarding that and the guy that was complaining about it.
5171127	5175351	But then eventually, like after he got done with his brain, he's like, we're going to play the game now.
5175351	5175531	It's like.
5177442	5185090	Why are some people, and it's always men, why are men so fragile about pronouns?
5185090	5186371	Actually, I know why.
5186371	5187272	I know why.
5187272	5189214	I mean, here it is.
5189214	5199744	Let's have a very frank conversation, you and I. The reason why these babies hate pronouns is because it is their masculinity being questioned.
5201217	5205998	because it's rooted in misogyny, 100%.
5205998	5209639	If you are a man who says, why do you need my pronouns?
5209639	5211360	You are practicing misogyny.
5211360	5214501	End of story, end of sentence, period, fact.
5214501	5215501	That's it.
5215501	5222343	Because the whole excuse for that whole thing, when, well, why do you have to ask my pronouns?
5222343	5225043	Shouldn't you just know them?
5225043	5226484	Isn't it obvious?
5226484	5227984	Can't you tell by looking?
5230103	5232266	That's always the answer.
5232266	5239954	So it is the subtext there is how dare you question my masculinity that I'm presenting?
5239954	5242037	How dare you question that?
5242037	5244980	And that is why people dislike pronouns.
5244980	5246502	And to those people, I say,
5252027	5254128	And yeah, DarkSakura is in chat actually.
5254128	5257549	And I think she'll be joining us shortly saying the proper response.
5257549	5258850	No, I can't tell.
5258850	5260210	That's why I asked.
5260210	5262851	If you want to you want to shut a baby down.
5262851	5264532	That is a great response to that.
5264532	5265532	No, I can't tell.
5265532	5266573	That's why I asked.
5266573	5267713	I didn't want to assume.
5267713	5269814	That's why I asked.
5269814	5272895	I just wanted to be clear.
5272895	5279598	Anyway, let's let's travel back to a simpler time in our next segment, shall we?
5290860	5298625	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5298625	5309811	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5309811	5310832	I'm sorry, I'm muted.
5310832	5316575	I was just reading what DarkSakura was saying in chat saying, I flat out said, I can't tell you have ample bosoms, sir.
5317952	5318432	Great.
5318432	5319553	Perfect.
5319553	5320454	All right.
5320454	5332803	Anyhow, if you cannot tell by the b-roll that's already rolling over on our website, which those of you listening on the podcast cannot see, the classic game of the week is an old school classic.
5332803	5334184	I'm going old school tonight.
5334184	5335966	This is a game called Miner 2049er.
5337947	5343711	Miner 2049er is a platform game that was originally developed for Atari computers.
5343711	5346192	The creator was Big Five Software.
5346192	5352656	Bill Hogg was the guy that made this game originally, again, for Atari 8-bit and those platforms.
5352656	5357279	In the game, you are playing as Bounty Bob, and you are going through multiple levels of a mine.
5357279	5361822	You have to traverse all of the platforms, but not hit the enemies.
5362622	5365363	It's, here's the thing, here's the thing, and think about it.
5365363	5370625	It's Pac-Man and Donkey Kong mixed together.
5370625	5374786	It's the, it's two of the biggest arcade classics of the era.
5374786	5380448	Pac-Man, collect all the dots, mixed with Donkey Kong, run over all the platform.
5380448	5383710	That's, that's literally what Miner 2049er is.
5383710	5387651	And it comes from this long line of, it's not a clone.
5388211	5391613	It's its own kind of thing, but it gets really close.
5391613	5395856	Anyway, this game ended up getting ported everywhere.
5395856	5398117	It was made for it.
5398117	5402980	So I guess actually first, Billhawg also had made games to the TRS-80 prior.
5402980	5405842	So this was the first game they needed for Atari 8-bit computers.
5405842	5408964	It was on a 16 kilobyte ROM cartridge.
5408964	5412346	That's more than the 8 kilobytes most Atari games of the era were using.
5413267	5428527	The game was then ported to the TI-99 4A, IBM PC, Apple II, VIC-20, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Coleco, Super Cassette Vision, and of course, the Commodore 64, which is where I had played this game.
5429833	5432915	TigerKhanChat points out, I guess it's the best of both worlds.
5432915	5437178	Those being two of the most influential video games, you're going to see a lot of copycat games.
5437178	5443202	And like, it isn't bad, and it did do like its own thing, like you'll notice this level kind of has like an elevator thing going on with it.
5443202	5447265	So like it does, it's also elements of Jumpman, if you really want to be honest.
5447745	5449665	I would say it looks very much like Jumpman.
5449665	5450786	It does look a lot like Jumpman.
5450786	5453546	Actually, this might be before Jumpman.
5453546	5456587	But anyway, you know, all those games in this era kind of inspire each other.
5456587	5463289	Anyway, there was a sequel, an Apple II sequel, Miner 2049 or 2 from 1984.
5463289	5470370	Then there was Bounty Bob Strikes Back, which was on the Atari by the same creator that was released in 1985.
5470370	5476412	But by this point, Super Mario Brothers was out and everybody forgot about this game.
5476412	5477152	And I didn't forget.
5478612	5489475	Also, the interesting thing about this, you know, since I compare it to Donkey Kong, you know, Donkey Kong only had, I think, two boards on the home version and three boards in the arcade.
5489475	5495276	Because there was the infamous Pie Factory that was only in the arcade, but like wasn't on a lot of the home versions.
5495276	5496116	Miner2049er had 10 boards.
5500056	5507982	Of course, the Atari 2600 port being that it was on the Atari 2600, it only had three ports, but then they did a volume two with three more ports.
5508541	5512085	There were 11 boards in the ColecoVision and so on and so on.
5512085	5518552	So you know, there were were variances in this game, as there were lots of games of the time.
5518552	5523278	So, um, anyway, the game came out in December of 1982.
5523278	5528423	The game sold well, apparently about as well as Ultima II of the same era.
5529494	5533076	In 1983, it came out and ported for different systems.
5533076	5540439	An old review from a magazine called InfoWorld said Minor2049er was selling like crazy.
5540439	5546402	Apparently, the ColecoVision version by Microfun was the number one selling video game of its year.
5546402	5550143	So there, I mean, there was a lot of people that were playing this, you know.
5550143	5553345	By the way, if you're curious to play this game today,
5554285	5556308	The Atari 800 and Atari 2600 versions of Minor2049er are in Atari 50.
5562622	5565184	Did that leave me to thinking about this game?
5565184	5566185	Maybe.
5566185	5577534	But that's where you can play this game today if you want is in the Atari 50 collection, which of course is available on Switch, PS4, Steam, and Xbox One.
5577534	5584839	Allgame, not to be confused with the network we used to be on, but the website Allgame, gave this four and a half stars for the Atari 5200 version.
5586621	5589344	IGN gave it an 8 out of 10 for the mobile re-release.
5589344	5596412	It was given an 82% by Computer & Video Games, so again, pretty well received at the time.
5596412	5598294	Legacy of the game.
5598294	5605302	A lot of games were influenced by this, such as Manic Miner, Scraper Caper, which was kind of a re-release to that,
5607151	5612195	Again, we talked about Bounty Bob Strikes Back and Miner 2049er too.
5612195	5624445	In the book, A Brief History of Video Games, written in 2015 by Richard Stanton, he stated that Miner 2049er kind of contributed to the platform game popularity on systems like the ZX.
5624445	5627247	A Game Boy version of this game came out in the early 1990s.
5627247	5631871	I didn't even realize that one, but apparently it was a poor sales performer.
5631871	5632492	Well, again,
5633192	5637776	By that point, you had Mario and like Mario Land and stuff.
5637776	5648044	And Stanton, in the book, A Brief History of Video Games, said that Miner 2049er was forgotten and that Nintendo's game made it look like a fossil.
5648044	5652147	Well, we here at OLR, or at least me, we didn't forget you.
5652147	5657291	So pour one out for the classic game of the week, Miner 2049er.
5657291	5658231	There it is.
5658231	5660693	So did you ever play that game, Loki?
5660693	5661914	I don't think I've ever played that game.
5661914	5662875	You've never played that game?
5663068	5663649	Wow.
5663649	5665110	No, I don't remember it if I did.
5665110	5665891	All right.
5665891	5667532	I had an erased cassette of it.
5667532	5670715	Oh, well, hello, DarkSakura joining us here live on the show.
5670715	5671036	Hello.
5671036	5671376	Hello.
5671376	5673538	How are you?
5673538	5674799	I am tired.
5674799	5676541	I bet.
5676541	5687391	Well, I mean, it's a fairly serious and kind of relaxing holiday, but I've had some emotional times.
5687391	5688432	So I'll leave it at that.
5688432	5688572	Okay.
5689208	5695551	Well, I hope you were I hope you were pleased with my pick in your absence for Minor2049.
5695551	5698233	Did you ever play that game out of curiosity?
5698233	5699954	I had an erased cassette of it.
5699954	5700814	Oh, right, right.
5700814	5701394	But it was erased.
5702920	5707744	Yeah, thanks to living in Alabama and power surges.
5707744	5708284	Yeah.
5708284	5711766	And how quickly things got demagnetized.
5711766	5712947	Oh, yes.
5712947	5713708	Oh, yes.
5713708	5716830	Love the old technology, but not really.
5716830	5720673	Um, before we before we get into some rapid fire news, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
5722007	5730873	Um, it was the usual, you know, I played some Dead by Daylight and I played some, like, some very silly games on top of it.
5730873	5735837	And, um, I played, of course, some Dreamlight Valley.
5735837	5738619	That game is just sort of, like, my chill, cozy vibe game.
5741061	5750048	I didn't play my retro stuff just because of the High Holy Days being on, you know.
5750048	5753891	I've been trying to be more observant with all that.
5753891	5759656	I did play some Pinball, played some Weird Al, played some Twilight Zone.
5759656	5762198	Yeah, just, you know, not much.
5762198	5767363	It's been kind of an easy week, but I did do my DVD stuff.
5768092	5769213	All right.
5769213	5776297	Well, I hope on the foot of coming off of the holiday, I hope your new year is excellent.
5776297	5776778	Thank you.
5776778	5778959	Shana Tova to all my Jews.
5778959	5779259	All right.
5779259	5782261	So I actually SSJ100 Matt, I think said that earlier in chat.
5782261	5783162	He's three hours ahead.
5783162	5785824	So you know, it's already nighttime when the show started.
5785824	5787425	But I believe said that earlier in chat.
5787425	5787525	So
5788554	5798316	Oh, and I don't know how I never heard of this tradition, but there's a tradition to eat a brand new kind of fruit that you've never had before.
5798316	5801037	Oh, and so I've had my first custard apple.
5801037	5802397	And it's okay.
5802397	5807318	I don't think it gets all the hype that people call it the king of all fruits.
5807318	5812459	But I'm like, I would prefer mangosteen if I was going to eat something rare.
5812459	5812839	What?
5812839	5813759	You're a custard apple?
5813759	5815520	No, I said that you said king of all fruit.
5815520	5816020	I said, that's me.
5818965	5821667	Also, I only knew about- I know people who will fight you for that, Rob.
5821667	5822148	That's fine.
5822148	5827432	I only knew about apple honey combos this holiday, so that's neat.
5827432	5833197	Oh, I had- I made, like, these no-bake apple balls.
5833197	5835158	They're supposed to be bars, but they stuck to the pan.
5836099	5840360	I made them with dried apples, raw honey.
5840360	5844241	You're not really supposed to have nuts, but I did put candied pecans in it.
5844241	5849983	And I had dried cranberries and a few dates.
5849983	5851903	And they were really good.
5851903	5855644	I added too much salt because it needed the salt to offset a little bit of sweetness.
5855644	5858865	But it had this weird duality to it that worked really well.
5858865	5862806	And I had honey cake and I had apple cider doughnuts from Trader Joe's.
5864272	5875018	I mean, we were all about the sweets, which is now... And of course Trader Joe's is awesome because they have the ranchala that's traditional for Rosh Hashanah.
5875018	5880320	And it was really good and very light and delicious.
5880320	5889405	But it's sort of like I'm doing my big reset because I need to pay a little bit more attention to myself before TwitchCon if I want to cosplay.
5890537	5891098	and Matt.
5907931	5917202	What people forget is that that doesn't mean I don't also like apple like I also like the apple donuts and the apple fritters and like Starbucks around this time of year.
5917202	5921046	Yeah, they have pumpkin spice lattes, but they also have like an apple drink that's really good.
5921046	5924110	So have them add apple syrup to chai.
5924110	5925311	Oh, that does sound good.
5925311	5925932	It's pretty amazing.
5925952	5927012	Apple Hill to get some apple wine
5947099	5953245	And for those who don't know Apple Hill, it's a tourist trap here in Northern California, but it's great.
5953245	5954086	It's like up the hill.
5954086	5959452	I have the tiny apple cider donuts at this one place and you can get really good apple wine at this farmer's market.
5962676	5968483	But I did get a different kind of wine at Sprouts.
5968483	5975152	They had a pomegranate wine, a wine made all of pomegranate, and pomegranate's another, you know, traditional flavor.
5975152	5978997	And so I got pomegranate wine, and this stuff is amazing.
5978997	5980359	It's so good.
5980719	5984520	PodCulture in chat says, Wendy's has pumpkin spice frosties that are awesome.
5984520	5985860	You are the first person.
5985860	5989061	You're the first person I've heard compliment that.
5989061	5991101	It's a little too much sugar for me.
5991101	5999483	So it's the same answer I give to the question, have you had the ice spice drink at Dunkin Donuts, which is like literally blended donuts or whatever that whole mess is.
5999483	6002284	That's a little much sugar for me.
6002284	6005925	But, you know, okay.
6005925	6010346	I would have just a sip if I could, but I don't want to go to Wendy's to get just a sip of frosty.
6011966	6015327	If I got a Frosty, it's gonna be chocolate and it's gonna be a child size.
6015327	6017828	That's all I can handle ice cream wise.
6017828	6020628	And do you dip your chicken nuggets in that or is that like only a Shane thing?
6020628	6021488	I think that's gross.
6021488	6024509	See that Shane was the one that was like, no, you have- No, a lot of people do.
6024509	6025649	No, it was fries.
6025649	6027370	It was fries, not chicken nuggets.
6027370	6029490	A lot of people do it, but I don't like it.
6029490	6030971	Yeah, no, I know.
6030971	6034291	I also don't like their fries or their chicken nuggets.
6034291	6037492	It's too much of the hot and cold sensation at once.
6038149	6041439	But you know what I did find when I was at the grocery store?
6041439	6043786	Wendy's chili.
6043786	6044247	In the can.
6046329	6049931	And now Cheesecake Factory is having their brown bread.
6049931	6051752	So like, what are we gonna get next?
6051752	6055074	McDonald's frozen chickie nuggies?
6055074	6057916	You know, maybe zucchini bites from Carl's Jr.?
6057916	6058536	Maybe.
6058536	6059577	Mmm, crisp cut fries.
6059577	6063119	Anyway, alright, before I get too hungry... It's all about the zucchini.
6063119	6068082	Let's get back to some video games and travel around the world and check out some rapid fire news.
6068082	6070543	So, Loki... I'm doing this one, Rob.
6070543	6071323	Oh, you are gonna do this one.
6071323	6072904	Okay, well, let's go to Loki first.
6072904	6073585	And then I'll go to you.
6073585	6073785	Loki.
6074616	6081178	All right, so we have some of the games that are going to be coming as part of PlayStation Plus in September.

6132321	6132961	Neat.
6132961	6136463	Still doesn't justify the 30% increase but go off.
6136463	6137703	Nope.
6137703	6150708	And then of course for Xbox Game Pass, you may remember that they had got rid of the games with gold now and as they're going to have a core collection as part of the Game Pass core that you're going to get access to.
6150708	6153169	Well now we know which games are going to be included with that.

6210013	6210773	Let's go to DarkSakura.
6210773	6211634	What do you have for us tonight?
6240586	6243007	A game I own.
6243007	6247710	First of all, this makes me really, really, really happy.
6247710	6254674	A game I love, I was excited to get, I played the Shadow of on Dreamcast when I got it, Rainbow Cotton.
6254674	6263939	It's coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and computers in spring 2024.
6263939	6269262	And this game is actually the style sequel
6270082	6272324	to a game I've done as a classic game.
6272324	6274825	I don't know if I've actually done this one before, though.
6274825	6298742	But Panorama Cotton, which is actually a very rare Sega Mega Drive game, you know, Mega Drive, Genesis, where it is a over-the-shoulder kind of rail shooter game where you're having to shoot all the things in front of you as you go and you go through different towns and different places.
6300003	6302625	And this game is intensely cute.
6302625	6312334	It also isn't super easy, but it's the game that forever hid the words WEEELO in my head.
6313727	6318951	because she's addicted to this candy called Willow and she eats it until she throws up.
6318951	6325256	And she has her little fairy friends sort of like as options, you know, when she's going.
6325256	6328278	She has to rescue different fairies.
6328278	6330339	And it's just such a cute game.
6330339	6339406	But the game has been remastered, but trying to keep the same style and general appearance that
6342298	6345900	that the original had.
6345900	6348342	It's a really cute game.
6348342	6350704	The Dreamcast one was really excellent.
6350704	6353426	But they've done a few extra things.
6353426	6356949	So there is a dedicated retro mode.
6356949	6359491	There are enhanced controls.
6359491	6364955	So there's a snapback and lock-on features that have been touched up.
6364955	6367958	Full localization, including the cutscenes.
6368898	6381370	and different graphic enhancements like particle effects, ambient occlusion, things that you really only understand the terms for if you work in 3D rendering or are a big nerd like me.
6381370	6387836	So yeah, and I was just looking it over, and it's everything that I remember Rainbow Cotton to be.
6387836	6388596	Nice.
6388596	6391219	I'm pretty thrilled.
6391219	6391459	Awesome.
6392915	6400543	Yeah, but just I will have to play it in Japanese because there better be the way she says it is so funny.
6400543	6401464	All right.
6401464	6403987	Did you say you had something else?
6403987	6404327	No.
6404327	6404648	Okay.
6404648	6405028	I'm sorry.
6405028	6406249	I just made that up then.
6406249	6406650	All right.
6406650	6413657	Well, then we will go to traveling around the world and checking out some release dates and see what is coming out in a country near you.
6413657	6415139	Let's start with the US Loki.
6416149	6418810	Yeah, so we have a few things coming out.
6418810	6427333	So starting with looks like Pokemon Sleep, which came out today, apparently, in Oceania.
6427333	6429074	Okay, well, that's not helpful at all.
6429074	6430335	Thank you.
6430335	6431035	Ember Knights.
6431035	6435577	I bet that's the device, the Pokemon Plus Plus or whatever that goes with Sleep.
6435577	6435797	Yeah.
6437026	6439009	Ember Knights coming out on Nintendo Switch.
6439009	6445596	Lisa, Definitive Edition on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6445596	6448139	My Friendly Neighborhood on PC.
6448139	6451662	I love a good survival horror game that's set in Sesame Street.
6453023	6457346	We have Pokemon Sleep coming out this week.
6457346	6459227	That's on iOS and Android.
6459227	6461868	Viewfinder on PC and PlayStation 5.
6461868	6463229	That looks actually pretty interesting.
6463229	6465050	So I don't know what release that is.
6465050	6465650	I don't know.
6465650	6468592	I would feel like maybe the physical, but that's weird.
6468592	6468952	Maybe.
6468952	6469693	It's snuck on there.
6469693	6469973	I don't know.

6536029	6541552	This title, which actually, I keep forgetting, like for several weeks now, I played this like a few weeks ago, but
6542912	6544633	You'll love the title for this.
6544633	6547375	Yeah, you want those games, right?
6547375	6548615	So here you go.
6548615	6550416	Now let's see you clear them.
6550416	6559440	It is a game that's based off of all of those mobile ads, you know, like the weird mobile games that they show you and then you go and actually try to download those games and they're not the same.
6559440	6563562	Well, now that someone's actually made those into like a mini game type thing.
6563562	6568764	But that's on PC and Nintendo Switch, although I've played on PC, so I don't know.
6568764	6570305	Chat is asking if you're in the wrong week.
6572448	6574832	Oh, I am in the wrong week.
6574832	6575994	I scrolled my mouse.
6575994	6577676	Yeah, that's all I was gonna say.
6577676	6579018	I played that months ago.
6579018	6580501	Okay, well, let's start over here.
6580501	6581322	None of that's coming out.
6581322	6582564	That came out two months ago.
6582564	6583025	Oh, boy.
6586065	6595332	Okay, well starting with this week we have Gloomhaven, that's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

6620498	6622679	I've been seeing those screenshots going around.
6622679	6625321	That is some scary models there.
6625321	6628243	Technically, the early access started a few days ago, but...
6628723	6631284	I've already seen the whole game.
6631284	6632044	Yeah.
6632044	6634265	Shane was mentioning he was really into it.
6634265	6637467	So yeah, I'll have to check out the story stuff at some point.
6637467	6638147	Yep.

6656675	6656895	Okay.
6657315	6661078	There's something very important about that Man Yu game, because I'm looking at it on my list too.
6661078	6667263	The actual full name of the game is, Man Yu, defeat monsters and gain strong weapons and armor.
6667263	6669624	You may be defeated, but don't give up, become stronger.
6669624	6672567	I believe there will be a day when the heroes defeat the Devil King.
6672567	6676930	That is the full... I don't know if they let Fiona Apple name this game, or what.
6676930	6681153	It sounds like it was named by an 18th century author.
6681153	6683435	But that is literally, like, here's the box art right here.
6683435	6683895	Man Yu,
6685555	6686757	They're the whole title.
6686757	6688139	It's all there.
6688139	6691665	They let someone that was an Amazon seller name the game.
6691665	6692786	So, yeah.
6692786	6697193	No, seriously, that's how they named books in like the 18th and 19th centuries.
6697193	6698055	True, true.
6698055	6699617	Like super long names.
6701105	6710518	Payday 3 on PC, PS5, Xbox Series, Rin, The Last Child on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Avatar, The Last Airbender, Quest for Balance

6748134	6754838	Raznor, let's try to pronounce this, Razirinia, I don't know.
6754838	6756779	Stop making up names that are hard to pronounce.
6756779	6760582	Forgotten Alchemy, The Polar Knight Liberator on iOS and Android.
6760582	6762043	That's it.
6762043	6763383	All right, let's travel to Japan.
6763383	6765825	Not nearly as many releases in Japan.
6765825	6767906	I'm not seeing like a localized Mortal Kombat 1.
6767906	6772909	I don't know if that game probably can even come out there, but... The other ones have.
6772909	6773470	The other ones have.
6773470	6776171	For some reason, it's not on their list, which surprised me.
6777915	6785522	The general greater Asia region has a release in multi language, but not specifically Japan that I'm seeing, which is interesting.
6785522	6795390	But what I do see it Oh, maybe it's because I'm only looking at the switch to maybe it's something that but for the switch, we do have Pikmin one and two gets released in Japan this week as well.
6795390	6797292	Of course that is coming out.
6797292	6804398	And then as we go to the PlayStation five lies of P in a regular and collectors edition is released.
6804398	6804538	And
6805334	6807155	That's really, that's really it, I guess.
6807155	6808756	Oh, no, this would be before our next show.
6808756	6813599	Payday 3 is also out in Japan in a regular and collector's edition overseas.
6813599	6814179	That's really it.
6815727	6817608	Well, I've got a handful, too.
6817608	6819750	Okay, let's look at Europe.
6819750	6823973	On the 19th, for PlayStation and Switch, we have Gloomhaven.
6823973	6829297	Also, adding in Xbox, we have Mortal Kombat 1.
6829297	6832079	For Xbox and PlayStation, we have Lies of Pea.
6832079	6838983	For the same on the 21st, we have Payday 3.
6838983	6842026	Also on the 21st, for PlayStation and Switch, we have Paper Man.
6843106	6847527	For the 22nd, that's all of these last ones for the 22nd.
6847527	6851829	PlayStation and Xbox Switch, we have Avatar The Last Airbender Quest for Balance.
6851829	6856110	PlayStation and Switch, House Flipper Pets Edition.
6856110	6859791	Xbox Baby Shark Sing and Swim Party.
6859791	6861912	Okay.
6861912	6865673	On Switch, we have Pikmin 1 and 2.
6865673	6869854	For the 3, we have Days of Doom and also Rainbow Higher Runway Rush.
6872527	6874469	That's it.
6874469	6874969	All right.
6874969	6876871	The end is near.
6876871	6878352	That's it for this week.
6878352	6880854	Maybe it'll just be another big gaming news week as a result.
6880854	6882075	We'll see.
6882075	6883817	Let's go to a few more stories.
6883817	6885218	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
6886607	6888128	All right.
6888128	6895053	Well, we talked a little bit about the Embracer Group and how they were closing down Volition last week.
6895053	6897394	Well, that's not the end of it, unfortunately.
6897394	6908962	So Embracer Group is actually looking to, once again, still trying to recover from that $2 billion short deal that they're supposed to be having with Saudi Arabia, their financing.
6908962	6915366	And so now Gearbox Software may be up on the chopping block as far as being sold off.
6917083	6918563	I mean, cool.
6918563	6924004	I mean, I could think of a company that begins with micro and ends with soft that's buying people up.
6924004	6933586	So I, I can see them purchasing, you know, these companies, but, um, yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised.
6933586	6936247	So we'll have to see what ends up happening with that.
6936247	6942548	Hopefully it doesn't end up that they can't find a buyer and then everybody gets laid off, but we'll have to wait and see, I guess.
6942548	6944149	The hits keep coming for Embracer.
6944149	6945089	Let me tell you, boy, oh boy.
6945089	6945169	Yeah.
6948228	6950009	Alright, well then we'll move on.
6950009	6953230	Loki, what else?
6953230	6954951	This is just all sorts of wacky.
6954951	6965175	So, there is a game called RZ, The Jewel of Faramore, which apparently contains the voice actors and the artists from the Zelda CDI game.
6965175	6968877	So as soon as you see like a screenshot of this, it's like, oh, yep.
6969297	6972119	Here we go again.
6972119	6974000	And so... Why?
6974000	6975961	Because it looks cool.
6975961	6976581	I don't know.
6976581	6979543	It's got that art style that resembles a CD-i.
6979543	6981804	And apparently they did animate everything.
6981804	6988688	They hand-painted all of the animations and then translated them into the game.
6988688	6997313	And it looks like... I mean, the artwork looks very much like... If someone told me this was from one of the CD-i Zelda games, I would absolutely believe that.
6998114	7000456	Infamy is a very interesting way to put it, that's for sure.
7013440	7019223	Yeah, it's so they're like saying that, you know, every single background in RZ is hand painted.
7019223	7026986	So the design process was that I would do it all in the graph paper along with my design assistant and friend, John Lineman of Digital Foundry.
7026986	7029447	We sort of went back and forth on level designs.
7029447	7036210	Then I would gray box it and then would make a sketch based off of those refined gray boxes and hand it off to an artist to get painted.
7036693	7042640	So, of course, the backgrounds in the CD-i version of the Zelda game I think were also hand-painted as well.
7042640	7048427	And then from that, they said, we also have one of the painters from the original games that inspired RZ.
7048427	7054153	It sounds like they almost wanted to make another Zelda CD-i type game, but of course, can't license Zelda.
7055214	7057395	They also said, I reached out and pitched the project.
7057395	7062096	I made sure they knew it wasn't a joke and that I was being serious and I wasn't just a crazy person.
7062096	7063616	They were super on board.
7063616	7067577	Made it very clear that this was a passion project, a love letter to those games.
7067577	7068797	We're not making fun of them.
7068797	7071958	Once they realized what I was doing, they were excited and we had lots of fun.
7071958	7072518	So that's cool.
7072518	7079720	I mean, like, it basically sounds like it is like, you know, they like the Zelda games, even though they're just really kind of cheesy and stupid.
7081580	7086141	And so they're just trying to make like something that's like a spiritual successor to that type of stuff.
7086141	7087541	And you know what it makes me think of?
7087541	7091922	It makes me think of the people that have gone back and made like E.T.
7091922	7098023	a better game or whatever or going back and taking Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 and making it look better.
7098023	7106904	Like it's it's one of those things where it's like you're into the game so much you're willing to kind of go in and like show what it could have been with a little more love.
7106904	7107444	Right.
7107444	7109505	So that's that's what this feels like to me, honestly.
7109505	7110585	I think I think it'd be cool.
7111163	7114827	SG100 Matt says, I look forward to it being on a silly block for GDQ.
7114827	7118872	Speaking of GDQ, quick random tangent aside, but it's important.
7118872	7120674	Because DarkSakura, you may not know this.
7120674	7125739	We had some breaking news this evening earlier in the show on the show before us, actually.
7125739	7128182	Bobby Blackwolf is now coming to TwitchCon.
7128822	7138710	Um, because he will be one of seven hosts at GDQX, I think it's what it's called, but it's basically a mini GDQ that is happening at TwitchCon.
7138710	7141813	And so Bobby auditioned to be a host and he's one of the hosts.
7141813	7143774	So pretty cool.
7143774	7146617	And I was commenting- I'll be sure to come up in my pig cosplay.
7146617	7156405	I was commenting, I think it's the first time me and him, me, him, and you have all gone to an expo since PAX 08.
7157839	7158800	Jeez.
7158800	7161041	And I was like, Yeah, yeah, you're right.
7161041	7162322	Yeah, all of us.
7162322	7166125	Yeah, because he never made it out for Gamer X. He always talked about it, but he never made it out.
7166125	7169527	And then you sadly have never been to Dragon Con yet.
7169527	7171149	Loki, I was joking.
7171149	7174031	I was saying, Hey, if Loki could come to the gang would all be reunited.
7174031	7175412	So it'd be fun.
7175412	7176212	Yeah, it would be fun.
7176212	7176993	I would love to do it.
7176993	7180875	There's going to be the Hermitcraft people there, but I can't.
7180875	7182216	You know, can we kidnap you or something?
7182216	7183197	Can we make it look like a crime?
7183197	7185179	I don't know, maybe.
7185179	7186840	Sure.
7186840	7187140	All right.
7188434	7189995	Uh, one more story for you tonight.
7189995	7191175	Oh, and you know what that means?
7191175	7192076	Huh?
7192076	7194457	We can take Bobby to the pinball museum.
7194457	7196938	Oh, he apparently so here's the thing.
7196938	7198898	And maybe maybe Bobby should tell the story.
7198898	7199358	Not me.
7199358	7201239	But I guess I'm telling it.
7201239	7203320	I think he told most of it on his show.
7203320	7208342	He has always told Mrs. Blackwolf that they could go to Vegas someday.
7208342	7210083	And now he's kind of
7210985	7220851	doing this ahead of that promised trip, but since it's, and I'm using my quotey fingers, for work, he's allowed to go to Vegas without Mrs. Blackwolf.
7220851	7224914	Because with the timing and everything, you know, why doesn't Mrs. Blackwolf just go too?
7224914	7228216	I'm sure that would have been great if, you know, the time off, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
7228216	7234460	So he's avoiding the big restaurants, the shows, and all that stuff.
7234460	7238503	Bobby says in chat, she has expressly allowed me to go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.
7238503	7239603	I was getting there.
7241084	7247707	But yes, Mrs. Blackwolf gave express permission that the Pinball Hall of Fame is A-OK.
7247707	7252289	Well, I think since it's no longer by the Liberace Museum, too, so you can avoid that.
7252289	7254210	I mean, that's a big draw, the Liberace Museum.
7254210	7260473	The only problem with Pinball Hall of Fame now is that it is completely the south end of the Strip.
7260473	7264915	And the TwitchCon is with the Convention Center at the north end of the Strip.
7264915	7267676	Also on the north end of the Strip, the When We Were Young Festival.
7269015	7275465	So getting from north to south will probably be pretty easy, but going back is probably going to suck depending on the time of day.
7275465	7277549	But yes, definitely go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.
7277549	7278290	It's really cute.
7278290	7282637	I'm taking Lyft everywhere, except for the places that I go with Terra.
7282984	7284605	Yeah.
7284605	7287086	sg100mat says I thought they moved it closer to the airport.
7287086	7287707	They did.
7287707	7294871	That's that if you keep going just like a couple blocks further south on the strip, you're literally at the airport.
7294871	7297112	So yeah, the pinball Hall of Fame is like right there.
7297112	7297652	It's right.
7297652	7299333	It's like across the street from Luxor.
7299333	7306137	I think at this point or whatever is like maybe Bandolier Bay, one of those casinos that's really at the south end of the strip.
7306858	7307659	Oh, Luxor.
7307659	7308920	I have good memories of Luxor.
7308920	7314648	That's where I played the eight-person in-car Daytona.
7314648	7316250	Oh, wow.
7316250	7323140	Back when they had, like, a dead... This was... I was in early high school, I think?
7323805	7331950	But it was, um, we had, we had gone to Phoenix, um, to visit my mom when she was living there, married to the biker.
7331950	7336712	And she drove us, uh, from Phoenix to, um, Las Vegas.
7336712	7341415	And on one of the days that rained, like, desert raining, you know?
7341415	7341655	Oh, yeah.
7342656	7349624	And so we were stuck in the Excalibur, but they had the tram, the monorail thing, going to the Luxor.
7349624	7355150	And so we went to the Luxor, and there was a big Sega arcade, and my mom just let me loose.
7355150	7357493	I played everything that I could.
7357493	7358534	It was great.
7358534	7360717	And then we went back to the Excalibur, and I shot a crossbow.
7362620	7369482	now, um, while it's on my mind to delve into completely personal stuff, since I know you're staying with Tiara and I really want to see them while I'm in Vegas.
7369482	7371322	Cause I haven't seen them in a long time.
7371322	7379284	Um, I would love to, so either Thursday for dinner or Monday for, I don't know when you leave, but Monday for brunch, I'll still be there on Monday, Tuesday.
7379284	7379564	Okay.
7379564	7380084	Oh, good.
7380084	7382485	Cause our flight leaves late Monday, like late Monday.
7382485	7384325	So, um, I would love to do like brunch.
7384325	7387046	I'm flying out Tuesday and coming back Tuesday.
7387046	7388126	Oh, it's either Monday or Tuesday.
7388126	7391467	Oh, so you're like making a whole week out of it to have like reunion and stuff.
7391467	7392127	And then like TwitchCon.
7392127	7392267	Yeah.
7394490	7403261	I'm not going to be able to do Just to Carry On because I'm going to have all my cosplay stuff with me and I'm totally going to that weird market at that one casino.
7403261	7406485	I'm trying to remember what it's called, like the Omni Market or something.
7406485	7408087	Oh, is that where the after party's at?
7408872	7410354	That that looks so cool.
7410354	7411215	I know what you're talking about.
7411215	7414019	It's like it's it's all like a photo op Instagram type of place.
7414019	7416382	The actual official Twitch after party is there.
7416382	7420828	I was looking into it for a minute, but then I was like, I really want to go to that.
7420828	7424973	Oh, I mean, I just wanted to go to that market and buy weird shit.
7425233	7426194	Yeah.
7426194	7432359	Um, I was gonna say, okay, I didn't tell you what I ended up doing earlier that week.
7432359	7433781	Or is it Omega Mart or something?
7433781	7434261	It's Omega Mart.
7434261	7435282	That's it.
7435282	7441207	Um, so my friend was like, saying, you know what, for birthday, I want to go to Disneyland.
7441207	7442248	I want to do Oogie Boogie.
7442248	7444029	Let's do Oogie Boogie for my birthday.
7444029	7445551	So I said, Yes, we'll do it.
7445551	7446311	We'll go to Disneyland.
7446311	7449094	And then I realized it's the same week as TwitchCon.
7449094	7451056	So here's the hilarious part.
7451056	7452177	We're flying down
7452877	7461402	on Tuesday, going to Disney Tuesday night and Wednesday, we're going to the park, then we fly Thursday to Vegas and then do TwitchCon.
7461402	7465784	So when we do TwitchCon, we'll be coming off a day and a half of Disney.
7465784	7468706	We can we can always I'm always down for a Disney trip.
7468706	7469647	You know what, though?
7469647	7472989	But I can't but I've already got my ticket for Las Vegas.
7472989	7476150	Well, and tiara tiara time will be great too.
7476150	7478632	So we can do Disney another time.
7478632	7478812	I mean,
7480832	7484314	I'm gonna have to do like, after holidays or something.
7484314	7487196	Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you something about all that offline too.
7487196	7489157	So anyway, okay.
7489157	7490437	Um, let's see.
7490437	7495400	Let's move on though back less personal stuff.
7495400	7496941	More things that affect everybody.
7496941	7497121	So
7497641	7501324	You know what's all the rage these days is launchers, that's right.
7501324	7505368	You know what, to do Baldur's Gate 3, you gotta get the Larian software launcher.
7505368	7508511	You wanna play any Ubisoft game, you gotta get the Ubisoft launcher.
7508511	7514716	And I know we are sick and fucking tired of launchers, but you know what, let's pour one out for the one that started it all.
7514716	7520901	That's right, on September 12th, 2003, to play a little game that had just came out called Half-Life 2,
7522042	7524625	You needed the Steam Launcher.
7524625	7530371	And Steam has turned 20 years old this week, as Jason also named checked in our intro.
7530371	7531972	That's right.
7531972	7533854	Steam is well known for its sales.
7533854	7541081	It's also known for changing colors from the original olive green, you know, type of color system that had before.
7541081	7544345	But yes, now it is known as one of the behemoths of storefronts.
7544345	7545045	But what's funny,
7545886	7553731	People were so pissed off when they had to put that piece of software on their computer, just like we're pissed off at all the software that's trying to copy a success now.
7553731	7559074	To which really only Epic has been successful at even getting close, let's be real.
7559074	7561475	But that doesn't stop everybody from trying.
7561475	7565958	There is, as DarkSakura referenced, a sale going on as well for the 20th birthday.
7566398	7571983	And they're doing some interesting things like with like store pages or sorry, profile pages.
7571983	7579210	You can use those little steam points you accumulate to buy things like an enhanced badge profile or whatever.
7579210	7581071	And then of course, you can buy a bunch of backgrounds.
7581071	7583734	It's all the stuff that's from trading cards.
7583734	7586496	And I remember DarkSakura texted me one yesterday.
7586496	7588238	She's like, look, they have clue backgrounds.
7588238	7590099	And I was like, Oh, that is cool.
7590099	7591861	So technically, it's Cluedo.
7591861	7593142	They're going by the original name.
7593302	7595985	Yeah, well, I think the developer that made that game is overseas, too.
7595985	7597167	But yeah, I mean, same, same.
7597167	7598188	Clue, Cluedo.
7598188	7601972	So yeah, pretty cool.
7601972	7603634	I forget what my background is now.
7603634	7606597	I think it's, well, I don't know.
7606597	7607939	I think it's Pac-Man, actually.
7607939	7612084	I think it's like Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 or one of those games.
7612084	7612184	So
7612691	7615973	Mine is some retro new wave looking thing.
7615973	7623497	Quest Buster in chat sums it up pretty succinctly in chat saying, then I bought the retail version of Half-Life 2 thinking I could avoid Steam.
7623497	7626879	Now, my Steam backlog is so huge.
7626879	7629181	Right, Loki?
7629181	7631182	Yeah.
7631182	7633023	Only 800 games or so.
7633023	7633944	All right.
7633944	7640167	This is the part of the show- I did go back and buy like counter- even though I'm never gonna play it, I bought Counter-Strike for like 79 cents.
7641475	7644837	Oh, yeah, because the discounts are pretty wacky right now.
7644837	7647458	So but it's fun.
7647458	7649539	This is the part of the show where we open it up to you all.
7649539	7654181	It's the listener roundtable where we open it up for questions in our chat as well as our mailbag.
7654181	7658463	Participate at OrangeLingerieDo.com or our Discord server if you'd like to go to VOG.
7659189	7663791	excuse me, hiccup, vognetwork.com slash discord and join the green room.
7663791	7665092	We'll field a couple calls.
7665092	7667593	Or if you have a question, you can always shout it out in chat.
7667593	7671554	This is the part of the show where I would encourage DarkSakura to go to the mailbag and read emails.
7671554	7676917	But I think I think we're on almost a month straight now of no emails.
7676917	7679138	Spam needs to be cleaned out.
7679138	7679518	Yeah.
7679518	7682419	Yeah, I didn't have my hazmat suit available.
7683037	7685699	All right, hey, we do have a question in the chat.
7685699	7688501	Somebody is taking me up on my offer of a roundtable question and chat.
7688501	7690703	So Bobby Blackwolf asked this question.
7690703	7694546	My Nintendo Switch online sub is about to lapse.
7694546	7698249	How has the expansion pass been for you since you upgraded to it?
7698249	7707095	Good question, because you might remember I talked about it briefly on last week's show, but with my trip to Dragon Con, I finally decided, you know what?
7707095	7709717	I'm going to pony up the money for the expansion pass because
7710658	7720648	Originally, I thought that the Zelda Oracle of Ages and Seasons, I thought I would need the advanced player for that, because when I had them, it was on the advanced.
7720648	7724831	But no, those were Game Boy Color games, so they're actually in the Game Boy Player.
7724831	7730357	But it did get my brain thinking, and those came out, but it got my brain thinking like, oh,
7730937	7733079	What's in that advanced library now?
7733079	7735021	What's what's in all those libraries now?
7735021	7736282	Is it worth it?
7736282	7740005	And so yeah, I was like, okay, they've expanded the N64 library quite a bit.
7740005	7741226	There's a lot going on.
7741226	7742187	And I was like, you know what?
7743247	7750069	I don't really want to buy the Mario Cart expansion stuff, but it's all available as a part of the pass.
7750069	7751290	All right, you know what?
7751290	7751890	Fuck it.
7751890	7754991	I'm going to finally pony up the money for the expansion pass.
7754991	7756992	And has it been worth it?
7756992	7758672	Yeah, I mean, I've been having fun.
7758672	7760933	Like, I played a lot of the advanced stuff.
7761673	7766416	like Mario Advance, Mario Advance 2, WarioWare back when it was good.
7766416	7770038	I played all of those on the Game Boy Advance emulator and had a good time with it.
7770038	7771679	And then I was playing N64 stuff too.
7771679	7778683	I played Pokemon Puzzle League, which yes, I know we already had Tetris Attack, but Pokemon Puzzle League had Pokemon.
7778683	7782125	And it had like the round stages that are in the cylinder and all that other stuff.
7782125	7783666	So it's kind of fun.
7783666	7783706	So
7785905	7795027	I would say, especially at this point, now that the Mario Kart 8 expansion is fully realized, just about, I think we still, you know, we got the announcement of the last bit of it coming out.
7795027	7804608	Now that that's fully realized, if you didn't already pay for that separately, which Bobby says he did, whoops, that would make it worth it because you did pay for that.
7804608	7808649	What's left for you?
7808649	7813810	The Animal Crossing, but most most people are kind of past Animal Crossing at this point.
7813810	7815090	I was really surprised.
7816265	7823089	Going back to the Nintendo Direct stuff, I was really surprised they didn't actually announce more stuff for Animal Crossing.
7823089	7826351	I'm kind of surprised they did not do more DLC for that game.
7826351	7833335	With as big as that game was, that actually is a legit surprise, because Nintendo has been known to support even older games with DLC.
7833335	7834456	Hello, Mario Kart.
7834456	7836857	I was kind of surprised about that, to be honest.
7836857	7837738	So, hmm.
7839330	7844614	Bobby in chat says, honestly, at this point, Animal Crossing just now reminds me of quarantine.
7844614	7846775	Ooh, I never thought of that.
7846775	7850558	Does that game have a stigma around it now?
7850558	7851518	Interesting.
7851518	7853980	I never really thought about that.
7853980	7858263	Yeah, maybe by the time they release a new game.
7858263	7860585	I don't associate it the same way.
7860585	7863887	I mean, it's just that I think I hit the point where I did everything I was gonna do.
7864863	7875989	I I get that perspective though I do like I think my love of Animal Crossing predates that but I get it like yeah, I just think that's, that's interesting.
7875989	7879490	I bet you're not the only one that would have a thought like that.
7879490	7880911	Yeah.
7880911	7881591	Yeah, it's the whole thing.
7881591	7883852	It's like it's kind of one of those Oh, I never stopped to think about that.
7883852	7886514	But now that I am I'm like, huh?
7886514	7887494	That'd be interesting.
7887494	7888855	Hmm.
7888855	7889095	All right.
7890402	7894285	Well, I don't see any other chat questions or comments.
7894285	7897688	So I think that's going to do it for another episode of the show.
7897688	7898629	We had a lot of news tonight.
7898629	7899990	We had some good stuff tonight.
7899990	7905034	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it all up.
7905034	7910179	DarkSakura, I believe you're still streaming tonight, since everything's all wrapped up with holidays, right?
7911227	7919219	I'm tired, so I may play a little Dead by Daylight, but there's a chance I might switch to Dreamlight Valley just because I'm really exhausted.
7919219	7921722	I've had a very emotional day today.
7921722	7922504	Play what you want.
7922504	7923305	Dreamlight's fun, too.
7924251	7926433	Yeah, but I want to try for more adepts.
7926433	7929074	I got my xenomorph adept already.
7929074	7935659	I've kind of been on a big alien kick too, like looking for deleted scenes.
7935659	7941623	There's a channel I've been following called, I have to look it up again, it's like Alien Theory or something like that.
7943064	7951009	where they go into like the Apocrypha and we're recapping like original scripts and stuff like that.
7951009	7962716	And so I found out that Dark Horse actually did a comic of the original Space Beast script that turned into the first alien movie.
7962716	7964477	And it's pretty good.
7964477	7968020	I mean, and yes, there was a cat.
7968020	7968300	Love it.
7968893	7969453	Perfect, perfect.
7969453	7976937	I'm tempted to write a story called Jonesy's Tale, which is all just about the movie from Jonesy's point of view.
7976937	7979738	Humans are stupid.
7979738	7982360	They really should have listened to mom.
7982360	7988743	Well, with that, DarkSakura, any other final thoughts for us before you go off to set up for your stream?
7988743	7991744	I have new merch.
7991744	7993946	And where can people check that out?
7993946	7995146	DarkSakura.com.
7995146	7996047	Perfect.
7996047	7996247	All right.
7996247	7996647	Have a good stream.

8040478	8042939	No, we didn't really have anything.
8042939	8045679	Then do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
