0	14400	Cup Noodle announces the greatest innovation in noodles since the instant noodle itself.
14400	16440	Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.
16440	19180	On the grind, you need a quick fix while you quickly unwind?
19180	21280	Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.
21280	23280	Need a pick-you-up that won't thick you up?
23280	25440	Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.
25440	27760	Real talk, would slurp yearly.
27760	29280	This is the RGB package intro.
29280	32280	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
32280	35760	this and the rest of the two weeks in gaming news, starting right now on the show where
35760	37240	every gamer has a voice.
37240	46600	Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46600	54260	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again, as Jason said there in the intro.
54260	56940	After missing last week, we'll talk about that.
56940	64280	For tonight, September the 10th of 2023, episode number 973, and now live and on the air.
64280	69500	And with me tonight, joining me as always, say hello first off to Dark Sakura or Jamie
69500	70500	Summers.
70500	71500	Hello.
71500	72500	Hello.
72500	73500	Hello.
73500	74500	How are you?
74500	78380	How was your week off?
78380	79380	What week off?
79380	80380	I guess.
80380	81380	Well, technically-
81380	82380	I did a 13-hour stream.
82380	83380	Oh, that's true.
83380	84380	That's true.
84380	86020	So you were working, but different type of work.
86100	89640	Yeah, I was working it, but I didn't advertise enough, so only a few people were there.
89640	93760	But I appreciate the people who were, and I made a bunch of friends during my subathon,
93760	104100	and honestly, it's just the last few series of weeks have just been compostable.
104100	109400	It's probably was a tricky weekend to do a subathon to with all the stuff that goes on
109400	114140	for Labor Day, between Dragon Con where I was at, Penny Arcade Expo, I know here locally
114140	119220	SAC Anime, it's a big convention weekend, and the other types of holiday junk that
119220	120220	people do.
120220	124060	None of that had anything to do with what was going on with my week though.
124060	126620	I'm just saying the subathon attendance, yeah, yeah.
126620	131300	Yeah, I mean, but I honestly, I didn't advertise it enough, and that's really what it was.
131300	137060	And I mean, given that I have people from all over the world who don't necessarily celebrate
137060	142420	the same holiday or have to deal with our conventions, so it was just all my fault.
142420	147060	Well, you got to play video games all day though, so hopefully that was still fun.
147060	148900	All day solo queue.
148900	149900	Wow.
149900	150900	Except for a little bit.
150900	152900	I played with a few people.
152900	157060	All right, well, also joining us tonight, even though he's not on video yet, he is with
157060	158060	us.
158060	159340	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
159340	160620	Happy early birthday.
160620	162900	I've been here the whole time.
162900	163900	That's right.
163900	164900	You said what's going on?
164900	166620	You're not on video right now, but you will be later.
166620	168100	You're like rendering a video or something?
168100	172220	I am rendering a video that I've been working, editing for literally a month.
172220	174660	Oh, yeah, I've seen your posts about this.
174660	176340	You've been working very hard on this.
176340	184740	Yes, it's been a whole month that I've been editing this video, and now it is it is done
184740	189620	well is so done well as Dark Sakura beat me to it.
189620	190620	Happy early birthday.
190620	191620	Thank you.
191620	194220	Because I know your birthday is tomorrow.
194220	197500	It's a day that a lot of people remember your birthday.
197500	205020	And I have a disaster birthday, you know, mine was the Waco thing.
205020	209480	Whereas my birthday is the day that sodomy laws got overturned.
209480	211760	And there's also the gay marriage legalization day.
211760	214020	So I have a bit of a celebration day.
214020	217060	Although I will say I also share birthday with Tim Curry.
217060	218060	So there's that.
218060	219900	Oh, that is that is pretty good.
219900	222100	My big birthday share is Ariana Grande.
222100	229620	So who's your big birthday share, Loki?
229620	231340	Maybe we don't do Wikipedia.
231340	234020	Maybe we should maybe we should talk about the big event.
234020	238700	He shares his birthday with no, no, no, like, okay, well, I'm gonna try not to like, put
238700	240500	this in Debbie Downer mode here.
240500	245140	But no, like, so it was a bit of ironic trivia.
245140	252020	So I saw the other day, like on on Facebook, it was reminded to me that Steve Irwin passed
252020	255980	on September 4th, which happens to be the day that my mom passed as well as like, Oh,
255980	256980	that's interesting.
256980	258820	They passed on the same day.
258820	262260	But no, I know that's not positive at all.
262260	263260	Moby.
263260	264260	I mean, that's cool.
264260	266940	Oh, that's doubly cool.
266940	267940	There's your answer.
267940	268940	There you go.
268940	269940	I'll take that.
269940	271980	And apparently Ludacris and John Ritter.
271980	273620	Oh, wow.
273620	278700	That's one heck of an action movie right there.
278700	279700	And Harry Connick Jr.
280700	281700	I love it.
281700	282700	I say that.
282700	283700	Yeah.
283700	284700	Oh, hey.
284700	285700	There's some folks.
285700	289940	Well, Loki, I'm glad you're getting you're getting a YouTube finish for your birthday.
289940	290940	That's really exciting.
290940	293140	I am I'm going to be premiering it tomorrow.
293140	297260	It is my season two finale of Channel 64.
297260	303340	Yes, the season three is technically started like two or three weeks ago, but it took a
303340	304340	while.
304340	308380	It is essentially like a mini movie.
308380	315660	It is almost 35 minutes long with credits.
315660	323660	It is the culmination of all of the lore and S&Ps that I've been on since the beginning
323660	326620	of making Minecraft content.
326620	329580	And it is.
329580	335940	There's a lot of like deeply emotional things that are going along with it, I guess, like,
335940	341380	I don't know, like it sounds really like like depressing, but like it's it's basically
341380	343820	it's there's a lot of themes that go along with it.
343820	348740	And especially if you've watched my older content, then you would catch a lot of the
348740	350460	stuff that's in this one.
350460	353900	There's a lot of like kind of ties back to everything.
353900	358420	It's not only celebrating the lore that I've created in like my stuff, but the lore that's
358420	364060	been created in Channel 64 lore that's been created in other S&Ps that get brought up
364060	366420	in this.
366420	374180	It is been the most painful thing I've had to edit because like like put it this way.
374180	378980	So like a normal like Minecraft video that I put together and stuff like has, you know,
378980	383220	it's like it's like say, OK, well, a lot of these more recent ones.
383220	390380	OK, so it seems like, you know, maybe 20 video files, you know, audio wise, there's like
390380	394380	maybe 10 audio clips or something like that.
394380	396300	This one has three hundred forty four.
396300	398580	There's one hundred and eighty.
398580	402580	Last I count, there was one hundred and eighty, one hundred and ninety replay mod shots they
402580	405620	had to create and edit.
405620	410260	But that was probably two thirds of the way through the whole process.
410260	413580	So I don't even know what the new count is, but it's a lot.
413580	418500	So it was a lot of stuff and a lot of special effects things I had to do.
418500	424900	A lot of AI voices, a lot of voice lines by our voice actors as well.
424900	427180	Just a lot of everything.
427180	430920	But it's very it's action packed.
430920	432980	It's got emotional beats in there.
432980	434380	It's just got everything.
434380	436440	Well, that is my pitch.
436440	440060	You absolutely need to use your birthday to guilt people into watching it.
440060	441060	So that's what I said earlier.
441060	444260	I said I'm going to earn those guilt or use those guilt points that like get people to
444260	445260	watch the video.
445260	446260	Do it.
446260	447260	Do it.
447260	448260	It's a great time.
448260	450260	And it really I poured everything into this.
450260	452300	So I hope people enjoy it.
452300	453300	All right.
453300	456900	Well, we will look for that on the socials tomorrow, including the VOG Network Discord,
456900	460700	where I know you'll post that over at VOG Network dot com slash Discord.
460700	462780	Again, that's VOG Network dot com slash Discord.
462780	465220	A great place to chat with us throughout the week.
465220	469060	Speaking of birthdays, it is so tomorrow is your birthday.
469060	476260	But I noticed in chat a reminder that today is Pod Culture's birthday, which is funny
476260	480420	because I actually got to see him at Dragon Con where I was at last week.
480420	482580	So happy birthday, Brad from Pod Culture.
482580	485860	And it was great to see you in person last week.
485860	487740	So I hope you are having the best.
487740	490860	I know you brought back a nasty souvenir from Dragon Con, but I hope you are having the
490860	493620	best birthday possible in light of all that.
493620	497060	And yeah, I hope I hope everything's going great for you.
497060	498500	And Dragon Con quickly.
498500	503620	I will say, you know, I am not going to go too much into depth in Dragon Con because
503620	505340	I've talked a lot about it on this show.
505340	509900	And I want to nudge you over to our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.
509900	514740	Bobby and I not only did a Dragon Con preview show before, but we did a Dragon Con wrap
514740	516700	up show earlier this week.
516700	520820	So if you want to hear all about some of the details and some of our suggestions to make
520820	523300	2024 even better, I'm going to point you in that direction.
523300	527700	But I will just quickly say once again, a big thank you to the video game track as well
527700	531060	as the digital media track for having me back and taking part in some panels.
531060	535140	I got to moderate for the video game track a really cool panel on diversity in video
535140	536300	games.
536300	540420	And the only bummer was that some of our speakers kind of had to back out at the last minute
540420	546220	for whatever reason, you know, whether you know it's sickness or whatever conflict, whatever.
546220	552060	So we only had it was me and two panelists, one who's kind of worked in AAA games, she's
552060	556660	worked on some pretty prominent, you know, like, like Star Wars related things.
556660	560900	And then the other one, she was an indie developer who created, ironically, a game I saw at some
560900	562420	of the Friday gaming Expo.
562420	566580	So I was like, I remember you, I remember your hat and your game and all that stuff.
566580	570140	So but I bring that up because they were great.
570140	574180	And I was really I have to be honest, I was really worried about going into a panel with
574180	576980	just two other people to talk about diversity.
576980	579860	But but oh, they did fantastic.
579860	581500	I was so happy to be a part of that panel.
581500	582820	I thought we had a really good discussion.
582820	587520	So I'm sorry, but not every panel at Dragon Con is streamed, because they kind of want
587520	589520	you to go to Dragon Con.
589520	591800	So that one is not streamed.
591800	594660	So you'll just have to come next year to see a similar panel hopefully.
594660	599520	But the digital media track panels because the content is about digital media, it does
599520	602240	make sense that that is then archived on digital media.
602240	609200	So I will point you over to the YouTube channel for digital media, which is DC Digital Media
609200	610200	on YouTube.
610200	611740	That's DC Digital Media.
611740	614040	And somebody should probably drop the link here in a moment.
614040	620440	We just put up a YouTube of a panel that Bobby and I did with somebody you might know from
620440	624120	TikTok, who does very well there.
624120	628520	I think he just changed his name as of last week to the fit guy.
628520	634640	But we all know him as Kurt and or Vobe Kurt, as I joke, because it's actually VO or voice
634640	638560	over by Kurt, but some people say it Vobe Kurt, and I think it sounds cute.
638560	643980	But that panel is it was thriving on streaming media when you're over 40 years old, which
643980	648220	to be honest, a lot of people go, how is that different from thriving when you're 20 and
648220	649220	30?
649220	650220	Excellent question.
650220	651220	We answered in the panel.
651220	652740	So go check it out over on YouTube.
652740	654780	So a shout out for that panel.
654780	656340	So yes.
656340	660740	Okay, that's my plug for Dragon Con related content.
660740	662400	And thanks again for having me.
662400	666260	And I am already planning for 2024, as is Alan.
666260	669420	Alan, remember, this was Alan's first Dragon Con.
669420	673020	And he saw enough in the con, even though he was a little overwhelmed by, I think, just
673060	676740	all the people and all the things there was to do it can it can absolutely be sensory
676740	677740	overload.
677740	682420	I think sometimes he's like, I see the potential and things I want to do next year.
682420	683420	So he's gonna come back.
683420	685100	That'd be great.
685100	688480	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
688480	693380	We missed quite a few things this last week, especially because at the same time Dragon
693380	698180	Cons going on, and the arcade Expo is going on as well as some other conventions around
698180	699180	the country.
699180	703060	And we saw a few headlines that came out from over the long weekend last weekend.
703060	706020	Loki, I don't know if you want to jump into some of these or you want me to take?
706020	707020	Sure.
707020	708020	Okay, cool.
708020	710940	Yeah, I don't know too much about the Final Fantasy 16 stuff because I haven't been paying
710940	711940	attention to it.
711940	716140	But I do remember though, they did make the announcement that they are going to be doing
716140	722660	a PC version that is in development and that there is also going to be some two DLCs that
722660	724220	are going to be added as well.
724220	728260	And then they have an update that they've added to the game.
728380	732700	The PC version I'm excited about because then I actually get to play it because I am not
732700	734800	buying a console for a game.
734800	735800	So sorry.
735800	737140	And people are going to mod the hell out of it.
737140	738140	So that's going to be interesting.
738140	743900	I mean, yeah, like, yeah, that's how it goes.
743900	748980	How many days until a nude Sid and a nude Clive mod?
748980	750980	Less than zero.
750980	757380	The question is though, do we get nude mod before we get CJ mod from San Andreas?
757820	759340	Which one comes first?
759340	760340	That's the better question now.
760340	761340	Like nude mod.
761340	762340	Yeah.
762340	763340	Guaranteed.
763340	764340	CJ mod.
764340	765340	Yep.
765340	766340	Guaranteed.
766340	767340	Which one comes first?
767340	768340	That's a good question.
768340	769340	That's the new meta.
769340	770340	We got to start betting on that stuff.
770340	771340	That's right.
771340	777420	But yeah, so they're going to they added an update which gave you a weapon skin feature
777420	783020	and also the onion sword weapon and new outfits.
783020	785540	And then of course, the two paid DLC.
785540	788700	I don't know if they go into detail what those are going to be about necessarily.
788700	793900	They did not talk about specifics, at least as far as I caught about what they will be
793900	794900	about.
794900	802380	There's a lot of speculation that because Leviathan was missing from the, you know,
802380	807260	the lineup of, you know, icons, I keep wanting to say primals because they aren't 14.
807260	808940	They're just like summons.
808940	811220	It's all summons to me at this point.
811220	814660	And honestly, fair, a fair way to look at it.
814660	817940	But that's the speculation.
817940	821380	But then there's also been talk about that they might set it.
821380	826300	It might actually be set either in the time gap, because there is a fast forward between
826300	830100	the prologue and then what you see later in the game.
830100	832500	And or even before the prologue.
832500	836060	So there's talks about that maybe the DLC will actually be a little more standalone,
836060	837260	which could be interesting.
837260	842520	But yeah, I, I'm okay with there being DLC.
842520	848640	I would rather see a 16-2 eventually that could fix some of the issues that 16 had.
848640	853160	Not just technically, but you know, with lack of representation and things like that would
853160	855240	be a great thing to add into the world.
855240	859560	That's why the PC version, you know, we can fix some of that.
859560	861200	Maybe the DLC will address some of that.
861200	863840	Maybe we'll go to another continent and we'll see a little more diversity.
863840	864840	I don't know.
864840	867240	I think it's really early to say.
867240	868240	But we'll see.
868240	869240	We'll see where it takes us.
869240	873960	I'm glad that in light of the stories, we saw a couple of weeks ago where people were
873960	878560	like final fantasy 16 only sold 3 million copies or whatever it was.
878560	879960	I don't even remember how many copies it was.
879960	880960	Oh God.
880960	881960	Tomb Raider all over again.
881960	882960	Yeah.
882960	883960	And all that stuff.
883960	887960	Like, I'm glad to hear it is doing well enough where they are talking about DLC.
887960	889760	And I mean the PC version, come on.
889760	895160	We all knew it was, we all knew it was coming and it was just some, some dumb arrangement
895160	897640	that was keeping their lips sealed on that.
897640	898640	But we all knew that was coming.
899040	900040	We would never do that.
900040	902400	That's what the, that's what the competition does.
902400	903400	And that's bad.
903400	907560	We fight against that in the, we would never do that.
907560	908560	That's awful.
908560	909560	Yeah.
909560	913920	So, um, it's, it's nice to see that that is all confirmed and all that good stuff.
913920	914920	So.
914920	915920	Yeah.
915920	916920	Yeah.
916920	917920	Uh, yeah.
917920	920840	So I'm excited for, Oh, and the other thing, I know this probably is not on your list,
920840	923920	but I want to say it about final fantasy 16 at PAX.
923920	925720	I was a little jealous.
925720	929480	Usually I am not jealous about the decision to go to dragon con over packs.
929480	931360	I've let my feelings be known on this show.
931360	932360	It is what it is.
932360	938520	However, Ben star went to packs and I was a little jealous about that.
938520	942760	And not only he wasn't the only one, several of the 16 voice actors all went to packs because
942760	946040	they, they did a panel where all this was basically announced.
946040	947520	So it's a little jealous about that.
947520	953720	And I'm hoping maybe dragon con will get the 16 voice actors next year because I I'll tell
953720	962920	you to, I will, I would do just about anything and I mean it to moderate that panel with
962920	963920	Ben star.
963920	970520	I'm just saying just about, but don't get crazy, but just about anything.
970520	971520	All right.
971520	972920	That's all I have to say.
972920	975800	A little bit confused by, by Ben star.
975800	976800	You're a little bit confused.
976800	977800	I actually don't know who that is.
977800	979200	Oh, he's the, he's the voice of Clyde.
979200	987120	The Ben star that, cause the Ben star I know of was on a master chef and it was really
987120	988120	cool.
988120	991640	Uh, no, this is, this is sexy, uh, Clyde voice actor.
991640	992640	Yes.
992640	993640	Who this is.
993640	994640	Yes.
994640	997960	This is the one that Loki said on last, there are two weeks ago show or whatever.
997960	1002640	Like, Hey, like even I get it.
1002640	1006800	I mean, he's an attractive man who has a deep, deep sultry voice.
1006800	1008440	I mean like, what are you going to do?
1008480	1011600	What's his, what's his, uh, he has a, he has a Twitter account.
1011600	1016240	That's where he posts all these things with like, um, you know, pretending to do voices
1016240	1017800	of Mario and things like that.
1017800	1023440	He does all these, uh, things and he's just, he's, it's not just his looks.
1023440	1026160	I mean, but the voice too, it's those things together.
1026160	1028200	It's, it's very, yes.
1028200	1029200	That's all I'm going to say.
1029200	1030200	Anyway.
1030200	1031200	Next story.
1031200	1032200	All right.
1032200	1033200	So they did a Nintendo.
1033960	1035960	Sorry, sorry.
1035960	1037680	My, I'm having some lag.
1037680	1038680	I apologize.
1038680	1039680	No, you're fine.
1039680	1040680	No worries.
1040680	1041680	No worries.
1041680	1045880	Um, so Nintendo did a super Mario wonder direct and showed off a little bit more of the game
1045880	1048360	and some of the different gameplay elements to it.
1048360	1049360	Actually watch this.
1049360	1055000	I, it feels like ages ago at this point, but, um, they showed off that this is the flower
1055000	1056520	kingdom that you're in now.
1056520	1058960	So not necessarily the mushroom kingdom.
1058960	1063880	They have six distinct worlds that are in this game.
1063880	1067240	And then what's kind of cool about that is there's, um, some of the different levels
1067240	1071440	that are in there, you can actually tackle in any order that you want.
1071440	1076720	Um, a little more disappointing though, is the fact that all of the different characters
1076720	1078040	that they have available.
1078040	1087480	So like Luigi, peach, uh, Daisy, toad, um, and toadette all play the same, which I feel
1087480	1091280	is kind of like, you know, a missed opportunity.
1091280	1097600	However, they do have, um, as part of that kind of being more open to gamers that may
1097600	1099760	not necessarily be as good.
1099760	1106360	Um, they have Yoshi and nabbit that have different effects to them.
1106360	1111520	Uh, that allows the game to be played in a way that, you know, is much easier, you know,
1111520	1115320	with of course, like the floaty jumps that Yoshi has.
1115320	1123040	And I think also just not really being able to, uh, let's see, yeah, Yoshi, let's see.
1123040	1124520	You can also ride Yoshi.
1124520	1125920	Someone else is playing them as well.
1125920	1126920	That's kind of cool.
1126920	1132980	Uh, they showed a bunch of new powerups, uh, like the elephant fruit and you can, uh, blow
1132980	1134560	bubbles and whatnot with that.
1134560	1135560	That's kind of cool.
1135560	1138160	A very pretty looking game altogether.
1138160	1143680	And then they also have this weird kind of multiplayer mode where, uh, you actually see
1143680	1149500	other players running around in the game at the same time and you can even, uh, leave
1149500	1156560	messages for them or like leave icons or it's almost like little cardboard cutouts that
1156560	1157560	you leave in the game.
1157560	1163160	And then if you die, if that bubble hits that thing, then you come back to life or something
1163160	1164160	like that.
1164160	1165160	I don't know.
1165160	1166160	It's interesting.
1166160	1170360	Um, and then they talked about like kind of the flowers that you can get that kind of
1170360	1174720	twist everything around and those are in game as well and it looks pretty trippy.
1174720	1181520	So it's, it's touch fuzzy, get dizzy vibes all over again, but you know, different drugs
1181520	1184280	this time.
1184280	1187960	But this is coming out in October on the 20th so it looks pretty sweet.
1187960	1188960	I will say it.
1188960	1189960	I am definitely picking it up.
1189960	1190960	It looks neat.
1190960	1191960	Yeah.
1191960	1192960	It's one of those things like how can you not pick it up?
1192960	1193960	Like it looks really good.
1193960	1200000	Um, but, um, I, I do see where it's unfortunate that the characters don't have a little more
1200000	1203960	of their personality like they did even as far back as super Mario brothers too.
1203960	1208320	But I get maybe for game balancing and what I really think they're going for, you know,
1208320	1210240	it's, it's Nintendo's bread and butter.
1210240	1215520	It's multiplayer gaming on the couch with young kids, hence the nabbit and all that
1215520	1216520	stuff.
1216520	1219500	Like that's very much what they want to go for with this game.
1219500	1224880	They want something that you unwrap under the proverbial Christmas tree or whatever
1224880	1225880	it is you celebrate.
1225880	1228280	You unwrap it and you go right to playing it with the whole family.
1228280	1230240	That is very much the game they're going for.
1230240	1234040	Um, and I think honestly these decisions are going to suit them fine.
1234040	1235600	The games, the game is going to do very well.
1235600	1236600	Oh yeah.
1236600	1237600	Yeah.
1237600	1238600	Yeah.
1238600	1239600	I mean, it's a Mario game.
1239600	1240600	It is not going to do not well.
1240600	1244240	Um, and then they're also releasing a special edition switch.
1244240	1245240	Well, it's not even special edition.
1245240	1248400	I think it's the red switch that they had a while back with Odyssey.
1248400	1253200	Um, they're releasing it again now with wonder in there as well.
1253200	1255720	Um, so neat.
1255720	1262400	Uh, and then last but not least, uh, volition has been shut down because the embracer group,
1262400	1268160	you know, as part of their restructuring since they don't have that $2 billion of cash in,
1268160	1276200	you know, being pumped into their business, they have decided to, um, shut down volition,
1276200	1282360	which um, yeah, I guess that's sad that volition is shutting down, but I mean, is it the same
1282360	1285320	volition that made some of the earlier saints row games?
1285320	1286320	No.
1286320	1292920	Also, I kind of feel that, you know, being that volition was at a point where they set,
1292920	1296840	you know, fans were giving them feedback on the game and I get it.
1296840	1300360	Like fans could be terrible sometimes when it comes to games, but like if everybody's
1300360	1304520	saying the same thing, like this game looks like it's awful.
1304520	1308480	I don't like the idea of these main characters just being college kids that are trying to
1308480	1311360	pay off student loans and then they turn to a life of crime.
1311360	1316440	That sounds really stupid and not gangsta, um, you know, maybe take that feedback.
1316440	1321080	It would be like the equivalent of say, for example, the Sonic movie.
1321080	1324680	If they release ugly Sonic in the trailers, everyone's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.
1324680	1325680	This seems bad.
1325680	1326680	They're like, Oh, that's good.
1326680	1328160	We're, we're going to keep it like this.
1328160	1329600	It's better this way.
1329600	1334320	Like and then being surprised what no one went to the box office to see her awful movie.
1334320	1336420	I am shocked.
1336420	1338360	And that's kind of what we have here with saints row.
1338360	1343480	It was just, it was an awful game premise wise and then awfully executed.
1343480	1349800	It was like the perfect storm of awfulness and not even in a fun way, like a Bethesda
1349800	1350800	way.
1350800	1353760	Questbuster in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network.
1353760	1355120	I don't remember if I gave the plug.
1355120	1358160	We do tape live Sunday nights, of course, at nine Eastern six Pacific over at Twitch
1358160	1362920	TV slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show and a Questbuster says, Volition
1362920	1367520	news is sad, but after agents of mayhem in 2017, there were questions on what was going
1367520	1368920	to happen with the studio.
1368920	1372360	And that's like, Loki, that's kind of got the vibe I got from your opinion because at
1372360	1376640	first I was like, Oh, Loki's going to probably be really sad because this is the studio that
1376640	1378640	made those earlier saints road games.
1378640	1380600	But then you were kind of like the same studio anymore.
1380600	1381600	Yeah, exactly.
1381600	1382920	They've been going downhill for years.
1382920	1384920	So you were unfortunate.
1384920	1389960	It's unfortunate because like, you know, one of the big champions of like kind of the,
1389960	1392480	the core saints row games was idle Ninja.
1392480	1396200	And unfortunately when he passed, it was just any hope that we had left for the studio was
1396200	1399240	just it died with them, unfortunately.
1399240	1403280	And it's sad because you would hope that there are people that kind of want to bring that
1403280	1404280	back.
1404280	1405280	And I get it.
1405280	1406280	Like they were in a tough position.
1406280	1409160	Like they had gone way too wacky with Saints Row.
1409160	1412400	It was just like off the rails crazy at that point.
1412400	1413400	They could have dialed it back.
1413400	1417840	I mean, the whole fact that this is a reboot means you can dial it back to that earlier
1417840	1418840	game.
1418840	1422960	Just all you had to do was recreate the kind of sandbox environment that you have the original
1422960	1423960	game.
1423960	1429000	And it's sort of, you know, mentality is to add a solid story with the earlier games.
1429000	1431040	And it had that grit on it.
1431040	1432460	This has no grit on it.
1432460	1436200	This is basically stupid characters that nobody likes.
1436200	1439900	And even worse, like when you actually play through the game, and you actually listen
1439900	1445480	to your character, like you hate them even more like that is poor writing.
1445480	1448680	It's poor writing, poor execution, poor everything.
1448680	1453080	And even on top of all that, like after all of that was done, they publish the game, they
1453080	1457280	still have the gall to put out DLC.
1457280	1466180	That was about larping like, I'm sorry, larping in a gangster, you know, sandbox game.
1466180	1467240	What the hell is that?
1467240	1468840	Like it makes no sense whatsoever.
1468840	1471800	And they just kept doubling and tripling down on this stuff.
1471800	1473720	So yeah, they had it coming.
1473720	1474780	I'm sorry.
1474780	1479120	But like, if you keep making bad decisions over and over and over again, you're not going
1479120	1481760	to be operating anymore.
1481760	1488160	It sure was interesting how Saints Row showed up on PlayStation Plus, like, a day after
1488160	1489160	this announcement.
1489160	1490160	You know what I mean?
1490160	1494200	Plus, wasn't this announcement tied with something like they really tried to sneak this announcement
1494200	1496660	out there like people would notice.
1496660	1503040	Like I want to say it came out the same time as like, either it was on it released on steam
1503040	1507520	to like the game released on steam shortly before the seems wrong to the volition news
1507520	1512360	about the closure that they time that very strange.
1512360	1513360	I don't know.
1513360	1517640	And then I mean, I feel bad for the people that worked for volition.
1517640	1523240	But at the same time, like, like, I'm sorry, some accountability needs to be had like,
1523240	1527720	like, yeah, I it feels bad for any developer to close down and the people that are affected
1527720	1528720	by that.
1528720	1531000	Like, because there are a lot of people that like that they were just doing what they're
1531000	1533860	told and like making the best thing they could do it.
1533860	1537140	But someone in the chain screwed that up big time.
1537140	1539020	And I think is more than just like a few people.
1539020	1542260	It was a lot of people that really screwed the pooch on that one.
1542260	1545180	So I don't know.
1545180	1548620	Quest Buster pointing out in our chat volition had some great titles in their history, red
1548620	1552040	faction, the free space, space, Sims and descent.
1552040	1555820	But as Loki pointed out, most of the people that came with those likely left.
1555820	1556820	Yeah, exactly.
1556820	1561540	And red faction, free space and all that stuff, like, if they would put out more of those
1561540	1565160	games, like I would have loved to see, like, hey, I have an idea.
1565160	1568700	If you don't know what to do with Saints Row, then don't do anything with it.
1568700	1572400	Create a new red faction game and do that like you could have taken that.
1572400	1576360	Well, I mean, it still may have been bad, but you could have at least taken red faction
1576360	1581160	and like been able to stick with the space stuff and have an action game based off that.
1581160	1583640	And that would probably have been more successful than this was.
1583640	1586280	But they just.
1586280	1590160	I don't know what they were thinking with this, honestly, because like after we saw
1590160	1594400	the first really is like, oh, and then after we learned more about the characters, like,
1594440	1597200	oh, no, no, no, no.
1597200	1599280	They just kept going with that.
1599480	1602040	They know like, oh, hey, we're listening to you.
1602040	1604540	We're taking your feedback. It's like, no.
1604540	1606920	Goes straight up with what we're doing.
1606920	1611000	All right. Well, I guess it's one of those things where it's it's
1611840	1613540	it's a shock, but it's not a shock, right?
1613540	1616140	It's like, oh, my gosh, they really did close the studio.
1616140	1619000	And then you go, well, you look at what happened in seven years.
1619000	1620840	It's not that surprising.
1620840	1623380	Like the caveat with this, though, is volitions gone.
1623380	1625760	But that doesn't mean the Saints license is dead.
1625760	1629180	You can give it to another studio and they can start from scratch.
1629380	1632940	And I want to say that I thought Gearbox was going to be doing something
1633440	1637180	maybe with it, but like give it to somebody that like Gearbox,
1637640	1641400	like whether you like Borderlands or, you know, some of that stuff,
1641400	1645860	they have pretty good writers that understand context
1645860	1649280	and understand humor and understand all that stuff instead of just like
1649280	1652660	making fart jokes all the time like that. It's just awful.
1652660	1654100	It's bad writing.
1654100	1658740	And I just think that those folks would have a better time
1658740	1661500	with something like this because they can have fun with it.
1661700	1663460	They know how to make a solid engine.
1663460	1665960	They know how to make a solid game.
1665960	1668620	Like let somebody competent take it.
1668620	1672720	All right. Well, that about covers some of the big headlines
1672720	1676420	we missed from our week off, but we still have to get to this week's headlines.
1676680	1677840	So we'll get to that shortly.
1677840	1680300	But first, we're going to get into our gaming weeks
1680320	1682700	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week
1682700	1684700	or in the last two weeks, I suppose.
1684700	1687120	So let's kick it off. How was your gaming week?
1687120	1688920	We'll go to Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?
1690540	1692160	It was all right.
1694000	1694960	What did I play?
1694960	1699800	I played Cult of the Lamb today to show it off to a friend.
1702140	1707180	I played, of course, I finished through all of the individual scenarios
1707180	1708680	for Live Alive.
1709680	1713480	So I'm actually into like the main part of the end game.
1714700	1720200	And everything has just frozen on me all of a sudden.
1723540	1724280	Hello?
1724280	1727340	I'm here. Sorry, I did notice your avatar is frozen.
1728460	1730120	Yeah, I don't I don't know what happened.
1730120	1732160	Just a bunch of stuff decided to freeze on me.
1732160	1740500	So, but at any rate, I've also we got Godzilla pinball temporarily.
1741500	1743500	So we did a little momentary trade for that.
1745500	1751000	Also, we got Galactic Tank Force, which is amazing and cheeseball.
1751000	1754920	And like the whole readout part of it is like watching a Sega CD game.
1754920	1758220	It's pretty it's pretty, pretty rad.
1758220	1760380	That sounds cool. I don't even know what it is.
1761140	1763980	Yeah, well, you guys are welcome to come over and play.
1763980	1766280	I'll see about finding some pictures.
1766280	1770280	Of course, Dead by Daylight and Disney Dreamlight Valley.
1770280	1774580	The Godzilla table, though, that is more fun than I thought it was going to be.
1774580	1776880	And I'm not even kidding.
1776880	1779880	So, yeah, it's cool.
1779880	1784380	And of course, it ends in the Go Godzilla!
1784380	1786380	You know, when you're done with your game.
1786380	1789380	Still playing Weird Al.
1790380	1798380	And my stupid wordscape game that I'm I'm feeling angry in a certain way about because.
1798380	1802380	It just it takes money out of me and I don't want it to happen.
1802380	1804380	That table looks awesome. I like it.
1804380	1809380	I like I like the whole like vintage sci-fi stuff.
1809380	1811380	Yeah, it's awesome.
1811380	1814380	But no, it's it's it's super, it's super good.
1814380	1818380	Does the table that you guys have, do you have the tank treads on the side?
1819380	1820380	We do not.
1820380	1827380	And actually, the thing is, is that it comes with like a big cannon that attaches to the back of the table, you know, in the back glass area.
1827380	1830380	And when you fold it down, it looks like the tank.
1830380	1838380	I don't know if that's like my jam or not, but it's it's it's a pretty sweet, pretty sweet setup.
1838380	1841380	And for the record, I'm relaunching all of my camera stuff.
1841380	1851380	So but anyway, I I really, really have just been all over both of these tables.
1851380	1853380	There's so much fun.
1853380	1862380	And I I played a little bit of.
1862380	1870380	What was it? It was I don't remember what it was I played it was it was something that I was trying out, but I did buy Baldur's Gate 3.
1871380	1877380	Because the Mac version is going to officially be out right now.
1877380	1885380	The version that you can play is is the last build for it, like of the betas before they released it.
1885380	1893380	So I'm I'm feeling feeling pretty, pretty OK about it.
1893380	1898380	OK, I think I see what's happening with my camera.
1898380	1908380	It's. It's just I mean, there's so much stuff for me to play at my house now that I don't even know, like.
1908380	1920380	What else to play, I have to we've organized the game room now and and I'm really hoping that we can actually get the whole classic game set up back again.
1920380	1926380	So I'm looking forward to to making the best out of that.
1926380	1931380	But right now, it's just been my usual and a lot of pinball.
1931380	1936380	All right. Loki, how about you? I know you've been working on a video, but anything else you gave me?
1936380	1940380	No, I was editing the entire time, unfortunately.
1940380	1944380	So I did play Minecraft, but in the sense that I was using it to edit.
1944380	1948380	Gotcha. So, yeah, it was it was only that, unfortunately.
1948380	1956380	It's been busy now, I noticed through the social media is that like the the Minecraft championship not rising is happening soon, right?
1956380	1967380	Because I've seen some of the program this weekend because I've interacted with posts when you were doing it now, like reading replies and stuff that now it pushes all that stuff to my for you page, which I try not to read, but like always defaults to that.
1967380	1969380	I can't help but see some of it, you know.
1969380	1979380	So I just I thought the other thought of you, they have a Canon event this weekend on the 16th at noon Pacific.
1979380	1994380	And then there's a special thing that they're doing in collaboration with Twitch rivals at TwitchCon that they're doing an in-person Minecraft MCC thing, although it's supposed to be different, though.
1994380	2000380	That's non-canon. I think it's with fewer players, so I'm not sure what they're doing with that, but that'll be interesting, too.
2000380	2005380	I almost want to go to TwitchCon for that, but I can't because it's too soon.
2005380	2010380	I will get B-roll for you or Jamie will, because I it's in our both our plans.
2010380	2016380	So, yeah, maybe that might be something that's five weeks away.
2016380	2017380	TwitchCon, I can't.
2017380	2022380	Yeah, that would be something to look forward to maybe next year or something like that.
2022380	2024380	Yeah, would be cool.
2024380	2026380	All right, well, my gaming week.
2026380	2034380	So obviously I was busy with travel to Dragon Con and doing the convention, but, you know, they had a nice arcade there at the convention.
2034380	2036380	So it was it was cool.
2036380	2041380	They kind of had two vendors that were merged together into one long arcade.
2041380	2045380	They had the joystick game bar, which is like classic games.
2045380	2047380	I'm trying to remember what I played in the classic arcade.
2047380	2048380	Oh, Mortal Kombat 2.
2048380	2054380	I remember playing that because I still I still remember Katana's fatality block, block, block, block, block.
2054380	2057380	High kick is easy, easy fatality.
2057380	2061380	And I was I was doing that because I'm a one trick pony with those fatalities in that game.
2061380	2063380	So I was playing a little bit of that.
2063380	2068380	And the save point was the group that brought the import games.
2068380	2076380	They actually had a working Technica machine, which I hadn't seen in a while, so I could actually play Flee, which is my favorite song in Technica.
2076380	2080380	And they they they also had a space Harrier machine.
2080380	2081380	So I thought of Jamie again.
2081380	2084380	I didn't take a picture this time because somebody was playing it when I walked by it.
2084380	2088380	But yeah, I saw that.
2088380	2090380	Wait, YYR?
2090380	2094380	That was literally your machine I was playing?
2094380	2096380	That is funny or used to be.
2096380	2097380	I guess that's funny.
2097380	2098380	Oh, wow.
2098380	2099380	What a small world.
2099380	2101380	OK, well, thanks YYR.
2101380	2106380	So your your arcade machine got to Dragon Con before you did.
2106380	2108380	I want you to think about that for a minute.
2108380	2110380	I'm just I'm just messing.
2110380	2112380	But that's cool that I played that.
2112380	2114380	But yeah, they had a lot of other like dance games.
2114380	2118380	Obviously, the dance games were super popular and people were lining up for them.
2118380	2121380	And, you know, I've played plenty of dance games in my time.
2121380	2130380	I finally ponied up the money to get the Nintendo expansion pack for Nintendo Switch online because I finally just wanted to play some of the Game Boy Advance games.
2130380	2140380	And I played a lot of Mario Advance and Mario Advance 2, which is actually Super Mario 2 is the original Advance and the Super Mario World is Advance 2.
2140380	2142380	And I was playing a little bit of that.
2142380	2144380	So that was a lot of fun.
2144380	2145380	I played on that.
2145380	2150380	And then when I got back, boy oh boy, there's just been games coming out left and right.
2150380	2153380	So like Dark Sakura, I have picked up Baldur's Gate 3.
2153380	2157380	I haven't played it yet, though, but that's coming this next week.
2157380	2163380	You all know the individual in my life that can talk me into buying a game so that we can play it together.
2163380	2166380	He's very good at convincing people to do things.
2166380	2169380	So please look forward to that.
2169380	2177380	And also, in addition to that, I picked up Starfield since that is, you know, of course, on Game Pass.
2177380	2183380	I think many of you were doing what I was doing this week and checking out Starfield, my Game Pass subscription.
2183380	2185380	It was weird.
2185380	2189380	I wasn't sure how I felt about Starfield at first.
2189380	2197380	I was a little bit, you know, especially coming from something like No Man's Sky, which is like relatively simple exploration and very chill.
2197380	2203380	Like there's a lot more stuff and micromanagy types of things.
2203380	2205380	It's a Bethesda game, right?
2205380	2206380	It's a Bethesda game.
2206380	2209380	And you have to think about how much you're carrying.
2209380	2215380	When you're setting up the bases, do you have the material the right way to do this and farming stuff?
2215380	2218380	And what really bothered me was the space flight.
2218380	2224380	I did not care for the space flight and how much was going into that as opposed to No Man's Sky.
2224380	2231380	Now, granted, the game will let you kind of skip a lot of space flight after the tutorial because you can just fast travel to different places.
2231380	2234380	So that is nice.
2234380	2236380	They do put some quality of life things in there.
2236380	2243380	So like I said, I wasn't quite sure I was feeling the game at first, but I really sat down with it.
2243380	2250380	And there was some point where, and again, I'm trying to keep it light on spoilers, but you get a companion pretty early on in the game.
2250380	2253380	And she wants to go do this certain mission.
2253380	2257380	And you're in our solar system that we know today.
2257380	2259380	They call it in the game Sol, S-O-L.
2259380	2265380	But it's the solar system we know today, except something has happened to Earth.
2265380	2272380	It looks like a big desert now, which probably is just a commentary on climate change and all of that because that's probably more likely than you think.
2272380	2275380	But nobody lives on it anymore.
2275380	2283380	But you get to go to the moon and your companion actually says, if you want to go land on the moon and just play around a little bit,
2283380	2286380	which is funny because other people I talked to, I guess, didn't get this dialogue option.
2286380	2294380	But because I went diplomat, I think I get maybe some expanded options and maybe I'm not picking the same things in the dialogue tree that some of you are doing.
2294380	2297380	So she said, yeah, if you want to go down to the moon, we could do it.
2297380	2301380	It didn't pop it up, but it's just a suggestion she made. It didn't pop a new quest or anything.
2301380	2304380	So I went down to the moon. I landed in a very random spot.
2304380	2310380	And then I was just, oh, there's Bobby, there was no, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I have no moon landing spots.
2310380	2312380	Neither did I. I just picked one.
2312380	2315380	I just said, we're going to land here and did it.
2315380	2321380	And I went to a very random moon base that was probably procedurally generated.
2321380	2327380	I picked up a quest from some humans that wanted me to go blast some pirates nearby to heaven.
2327380	2336380	And I went and explored this base for like 90 minutes because I couldn't, I didn't, I thought this room had a window over it.
2336380	2340380	And it turns out it wasn't. You could actually jump through the window.
2340380	2343380	And so I ran around in circles for like 30 minutes trying to figure this out.
2343380	2348380	But once I figured it out, I was like, okay, that actually did feel very rewarding.
2348380	2350380	And that was kind of neat.
2350380	2360380	So I feel like the game is growing on me more, but I just, I get like the overwhelming analysis paralysis that comes with a lot of Bethesda games.
2360380	2364380	When it's like, there's a table over here and there's crafting you can do here.
2364380	2370380	And there's all these things you can pick up here, but don't pick up too much because you'll be weighted down and lose oxygen faster.
2370380	2379380	But I guess there's, there's plenty of places you can transfer inventory to like your companion or the ship, but it's, it's a lot.
2379380	2386380	But overall, like it's growing on me and my impressions of Starfield are favorable, but it just took me a minute to get there.
2386380	2389380	So that's kind of where I'm at with that game.
2389380	2397380	One other game I want to talk about, which again, just a random thing that came out in the last couple of weeks that I think for a lot of you is probably going to be blink and you miss it.
2397380	2402380	And I'm going to mention this game and you're going to say, oh yeah, that did come out.
2402380	2405380	Watch your, watch your, watch your reaction. Here we go.
2405380	2410380	So I also checked out this week, the digital eclipse.
2410380	2425380	I think they call it gold series look back of the making of Karateka, which the making of Karateka is all about the 1980s Apple II game Karateka, which was ported to the Commodore 64.
2425380	2427380	So they, you know, it's, it's very well known for that too.
2427380	2430380	And it was ported to the Atari, one of the early Ataris as well.
2430380	2432380	And they actually ported it to some other things too.
2432380	2433380	The game does get into this.
2433380	2444380	So it's set up similarly to Atari 50 and that they have all these old letters you can read and they have documentary style videos that are spliced in that you can watch.
2444380	2451380	And they do some really cool things because the whole thing with Karateka and why it was important.
2451380	2455380	Well, funny enough, fifth dream in chat says, does that tell how it's actually pronounced now?
2456380	2458380	LOL. Yes and no.
2458380	2461380	So there actually is a video that directly addresses this.
2461380	2468380	And the creator of the game, Jordan, comes up and says, I call it Karateka.
2468380	2469380	That's what I always called it.
2469380	2473380	He says, but apparently everybody else called it Karateka.
2473380	2477380	And he says, and actually, if you go to Japan, there is no emphasis on any syllable.
2477380	2486380	And most people in Japan called it Karateka, something like that is all like what they would say there.
2486380	2494380	So he says at the end of the day, well, he says, at the end of the day, I really don't care which one you use.
2494380	2496380	They're all correct to me. Thank you for playing the game.
2496380	2498380	That's basically what he says.
2498380	2504380	So he, which is what I wish the gift guy would have done quite honestly, but it is what it is.
2504380	2509380	So he has said he accepts all pronunciations of the game and that is the official answer.
2509380	2516380	So I just say Karateka because that's just, but it's funny because they interview professionals and other developers and things.
2516380	2520380	And there is somebody in the video who says, well, I just always thought it was karate and then kah.
2520380	2522380	So I always say Karateka and I was like that.
2522380	2523380	That's it. Same brain.
2523380	2525380	That's where my brain always went when I was younger.
2525380	2527380	So, yeah.
2527380	2531380	So that was that was it was neat that it answered questions like that.
2531380	2540380	But some other neat modes is that like the whole reason why it was infamous in gaming was that it was really a step forward for cinematic games.
2540380	2546380	And the way this is all laid out and the story that it tells in the game really lays that out.
2546380	2550380	And it's because Jordan used a and I'm not remember his last name in the minute.
2550380	2554380	Belkner? I might be getting that wrong. I'm very sorry.
2554380	2556380	He's also the same guy that made Prince of Persia.
2556380	2566380	Meckner. Thank you. Jordan Meckner made the game and he used a trick that old Disney animators used in Snow White called rotoscoping.
2566380	2571380	So he actually shot his dad filming different karate things.
2571380	2579380	He had a karate teacher do some stuff, but they didn't have that actual Super 8 film footage, but they had his dad climbing up onto the hood of the car.
2579380	2586380	And they showed how that actually became the protagonist climbing up the cliff in the first scene of the game.
2586380	2594380	And they used rotoscoping, which is basically putting traceable paper over the Super 8 footage one frame at a time to basically make the sprites and clean that up.
2594380	2596380	And that's why that game was so fluid.
2596380	2606380	But they also talk about other ways that that game became more cinematic and it talks about how Choplifter was very inspiring and making the more cinematic.
2606380	2618380	It really tells the story about how he did these earlier games. He was trying to sell a game called Death Bounce, which was essentially, long story short, an asteroid clone.
2618380	2623380	Copy copy, like just refined, refined, refined to its whole new thing that he just really wasn't able to sell to Broderbund.
2623380	2628380	And he just kind of had an awakening when he played Choplifter. He said, Why am I trying to make an arcade game?
2628380	2634380	Video games now because they are on computers and you own them, they can be cinematic experiences.
2634380	2639380	And so he decided he was going to make a cinematic game. And that's where Karateka came from.
2639380	2643380	And how he ended up making that game.
2643380	2650380	And then at the very end, it kind of teases that like, Prince of Persia was the next game, but that's another story.
2650380	2655380	Wink wink nudge, like the series might explore that as well in the future.
2655380	2659380	Yeah, Bobby points out he wanted a game that ended with the end and not game over.
2659380	2666380	But anyway, the making of Karateka does a very good job because you can play like they talk about all of these prototypes.
2666380	2672380	And if you want to play the very original prototype that Jordan Meckner sent to Broderbund, you can play that prototype.
2672380	2679380	If you want to play his asteroid clone that he made, you can play that. If you want to play Death Bounce, you can play that.
2679380	2687380	And then they actually did reimagined. So digital clips made reimagined versions of Death Bounce and Karateka.
2687380	2693380	And they're both very good for reimagined games. I know digital clips has been in the game for a while.
2693380	2699380	But whoever worked on those reimagines, especially the Death Bounce reimagining, because that game never was released technically.
2699380	2707380	Because they just didn't see a releasable, well, they saw a releasable game in it, but they wanted to make all these changes that Jordan didn't really want to do.
2707380	2713380	So you can go in and play that. And I thought the remastered Death Bounce was really cool.
2713380	2718380	And yeah, Bobby points out, you can actually watch somebody else play the game and jump in at any point.
2718380	2729380	There's apparently 14 different games in there. But it's when I say different games, it's like 10 of them are Karateka and two of them are Death Bounce and two of them are the asteroid clones.
2729380	2734380	So it's really just a handful. But you can play the Commodore 64 clone.
2734380	2746380	And they actually have the developer of the 64 version of Karateka named I think Veda Cook is her name, which she's trans.
2746380	2751380	And so she's not credited appropriately in the old version of the game.
2751380	2756380	So I was surprised that they did not go back and fix that in the Commodore 64 version of the game.
2756380	2762380	But perhaps they couldn't at this point. I don't know what happened to the source code. It could be lost to time or something of that.
2762380	2774380	But I thought it was very cool because she explains her relationship with Jordan, and how she was basically handpicked to do the Commodore 64 port and the Atari port, which I thought it was just a really good story.
2774380	2781380	So there's lots of really good stories. The way it was all laid out like a museum, I really enjoyed as well. It was really like an interactive museum.
2781380	2788380	So anyway, I know I'm talking a lot about this game. And you know, Bobby and I've talked about maybe doing a deeper dive video for the network later on.
2788380	2797380	So I should save some thoughts for that. But I will just say I was I was very impressed by this. And for 20 bucks. It's not a bad deal. I'm gonna be honest.
2797380	2805380	I don't I did play Karateka on the Commodore 64. I didn't like it as a kid. I thought it was too hard. I thought it was too difficult. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
2805380	2820380	And I thought it was too difficult. They never got very far. But going through this experience gave me an appreciation of like, Oh, okay, I see why like this is important. I see how this got to this and gaming.
2820380	2827380	And the fact that you know, the museum element, the documentary stuff kind of told its own story, I thought was really well done.
2827380	2837380	Now I do have some places I would give constructive feedback. But I'll save that for another time because I've talked about this long enough. But I think there's there's some parts that were glossed over a little bit for me.
2837380	2856380	And I'm just wondering if it was a rights issue or what, because, okay, I'll quickly say he made another game that they mentioned and they show a couple screenshots of but I really felt like that game seemed like a bridge on how he was able to design the cinematic stuff that he made.
2856380	2870380	And they don't really ever get into much detail about that. I thought that was a little weird. But maybe it's a rights issue. Maybe you know, because it belonged to another company. I don't know. But I just overall I mean, the issues I have with it are pretty nitpicky.
2870380	2884380	And for a first release in a goldmaster series. I'm really curious what other games they've got lined up, because they call it number one. It's even on the logo of the game goldmaster number one. So you know, they've got a queue of other games they're going to do.
2884380	2909380	Now, I can theorize a guess what some of the other games could be Prince of Persia is an obvious one. However, I thought it was interesting. They interview john Tobias from Mortal Kombat. I'm not sure why they're interviewing I mean, maybe because he also made a martial arts game. But what if you were interviewing him for something else? And you just decided to ask a few questions about karateka as well.
2909380	2937380	By the way, I if they do if they I don't know, again, right. So just if they were to do one for the original Mortal Kombat, because you know, all that motion cap stuff is out there. We were talking about this with Dragon Con last year, one of the panels that Bobby got to do. There was some behind the scenes footage of them doing the mocap that they actually showed that had like never been seen before. And you know, when I kind of put that together with what I was watching in the karateka thing, I was like, Oh, fuck, I hope that I hope Mortal Kombat one is like their next museum thing.
2937380	2958380	Because that would be incredible. Again, I don't know how rights issues would play into that. So it is a pie in the sky thought that would be amazing. I also noticed they had somebody from ID software, also seemingly randomly interviewed, who happened to be showing off a five and a quarter floppy with return or return to Castle Wolfenstein on it. And I was like, hmm.
2958380	2987380	That would be cool Castle Wolfenstein 3d could be a very interesting one. So anyway, all my all my thought is, is like, I hope there are more. So I do do check this out. If this sounds appealing to you, and show digital clips and the folks that are involved that we are wanting more of these because I thought it was well done. And I'm really excited for the potential of some of these other things. Again, I am completely making educated guesses based on what I'm doing.
2989040	3018260	These seem to be random people being grabbed for an interview, but maybe it's not that random. But we'll see. We'll see. Fifth Dream in chat says just do every game for real. No, but really, though, like, there's probably a lot of other deep cuts, I would have never thought of to do this, you know, I would have never thought I needed a look back at karateka. Just like I said, when I was a kid, I didn't know better. I didn't have the appreciation for games that I do now. I didn't care for it. And so I haven't thought about it
3018260	3047860	since. But thanks to this experience, I've kind of gone, oh, wow. Like I this is okay. I get why this game was important. I get the impact that it had on other people. And I get the story about this. And I mean, I think that says it all right there on why they wanted to do this in the first place. So alright, that's plenty for me. I've talked a lot about that game. So but I had a feeling a lot of you would be like, oh, yeah, that came out. Just reminding you because don't don't miss it. We want to see more in this
3047860	3077660	series. I think we really do. It is out on switch PC and PlayStation. I'm not sure about Xbox question marks, somebody would have to fact check that and verify. I picked it up on PS five personally. Because I was just like, I like my PS five. And I thought trophies might be fun. And I unlocked like two trophies. So sadly, no trophy for getting 100% on the museum. I thought for sure that would be a thing, but that's all right. Okay, let's move on and get into some of the
3077660	3085740	other gaming news from this week. Loki, we will go over to you. Oh, thank you. Why? Why are who says yes, it's on Xbox. Thank you. Okay, yeah, Loki.
3085740	3115740	Yeah, so let's talk about PlayStation Plus, since you know, Saints Row just recently was added to that as well. It's getting more expensive, because you know, that's what happens nowadays, everything just gets more expensive, for no discernible reason whatsoever. But they're going to be breaking down, or they're going to be raising the prices across the board for each of the different tiers, and some even more expensive than $20. So right now, we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about
3115740	3145740	PlayStation Plus, and we're going
3145740	3175740	to be talking
3175740	3205740	about PlayStation Plus.
3205740	3235740	So
3235740	3265740	if
3265740	3295740	you
3295740	3325740	have
3325740	3355740	a
3355740	3371820	game pass ultimate, like that's $17 a month US, that ends up being $204 a year. That's a lot. I mean,
3372620	3379020	when you break it down like that, that is quite a bit, that's more than what Sony's service is, but
3379020	3384220	like, I don't know, it just doesn't seem that bad to me, and maybe if you like break it down,
3384380	3389500	$70 game right now, I only have to do that three times through the year to technically get the
3389500	3396540	value out of it, right? That's true. Yeah, that's what it is. I think so. And I mean, from what I
3396540	3401260	understand with Sony service is they're not putting their first party games on there right
3401260	3406540	away. They're not day and date with launches, if I'm correct, because they want you to buy those
3406540	3410300	because they feel that their games are worth the money, and they want you to pay the money,
3410860	3414700	even though you pay for their service, but they want you to buy it upfront. And then later on,
3414700	3419020	if they're gracious enough, they'll give it to you for free. And to be fair, I would say Sony
3419020	3424620	is probably worth the money, but so are the things that Microsoft is putting out, you know? Exactly.
3424620	3431820	So yeah. Shane is in our chat. Chad Leland says, I actually canceled my renewal because their
3431820	3436940	justification of the increase is pathetic and vastly overstated the quality of their offerings.
3436940	3443100	No more online games or extra games. I'm tired of arrogant Sony this generation. That last sentence
3443820	3450700	says a lot. And I think I agree with it a lot is that is I'm also tired of arrogant Sony this
3450700	3457820	generation. And I don't like to root for people getting L's in the gaming industry because I know
3457820	3463420	a lot of people get affected by that. I don't like to say such sweeping things. It's like,
3463420	3468220	everybody there ought to be fired. That's not how we really feel. And I know that like you
3468220	3472860	were saying earlier during the Volition story, people that didn't make the decisions on where
3472860	3479660	to go with the story were impacted by the game. And that's too bad. But there comes a point where
3479660	3487980	I'm like, you know what? When the PSVR2 flops, I'm not going to be sad for Sony. Well, the way I see
3487980	3494380	it like this is desperation breeds innovation. Because if they're put in last place, like they
3494380	3500700	were with like PlayStation 3, they tried harder when PlayStation 4 came out. That's when we got
3500700	3506380	LittleBigPlanet and like some really rad games, right? So like, yeah, I think Sony should feel
3506380	3512220	the heat a little bit. And it's I'm not sure they learned from what happened with the PS3.
3512220	3519340	Because this is this carries a very similar weight to the phrase 599 US dollars.
3521660	3526060	It doesn't make it because like, they're consoles expensive. They're like, like,
3526060	3532700	just even the proposition of PlayStation VR right now, like, I've completely just given up any sort
3532700	3538940	of hope to actually play you know, that my wonderful spiritual successor to Until Dawn
3538940	3545100	Rush of Blood, because I'm not buying the system and the VR for like, was it gonna be
3545100	3552940	close to $1,000 at that point, like, oh, thanks, I'm good, you know. And I just will skip Sony this
3552940	3558140	generation. And honestly, like, considering how much I play my Xbox, which is not at all,
3558140	3564140	it's in a box. I'll just skip consoles this next generation too, because PCs the way they go,
3564140	3569580	like, I get the best of everything, I get all of the games, none of this BS about paying for
3569580	3573820	multiplayer online. And like, if they start pulling this, I'm like, okay, well, I'll just
3573820	3577340	play thousands of other games that are available all through all these marketplaces, because
3577340	3584300	competition and competition pushes those prices down, you have a walled garden, you got to pay
3584300	3588620	whatever they're telling them to pay. Bobby's needling you in chat say you only play Minecraft
3588620	3593980	anyway. That is true. And to be fair, you are absolutely correct. I am hyper focused on
3593980	3600940	Minecraft. But I but that is to say, you know, in because I have a horrible habit of doing this,
3600940	3608460	I still buy a lot of games, I just don't believe them. But I buy lots of games on PC. Yeah,
3608460	3613980	then I'll play eventually, you know, when I retire, I'll be dead before that happens. But
3613980	3619260	you know, like, it'll be just, you know, don't be there so that somebody can play them someday.
3619260	3624060	Or I will just collect them like you would like, I don't know, bobbleheads or something.
3624060	3628460	Shane and chat says, Remember when everyone was crapping on Nintendo for their service and price?
3628460	3633020	It honestly feels like the best value to me right now for the price the NSO plus expansion?
3633020	3636620	Yes, I do remember that because I was one of the people crapping on it. But I will say I thought
3636620	3641580	you'll notice two years later, I finally did sign up this week because I was like, you know what?
3641580	3647980	Yeah, they've added a lot to NSO. And you know, on N64 in advance, and even just you know, I was
3647980	3652220	like, Oh, I could get those Mario Kart tracks and stuff for free. You know what? Fuck it. I'm gonna
3652220	3657100	finally sign up for that. So it took me a little while to get there. But like, yeah, like, honestly,
3657660	3660700	and then the other thing I just want to say with PS VR two real quick is that you know, and I've
3660700	3665820	said this before, but I'll say it again. It's very sad that Sony is not learning this lesson because
3665820	3670620	I really feel like the PS VR two is destined for the similar fate. The PlayStation Vita,
3670620	3677100	the PlayStation TV, it's a terrific piece of hardware, horribly supported by Sony.
3678220	3684380	And I don't I don't understand why they need to like, honestly, like, I think the best course
3684380	3687900	of action for Sony and something like that. And it's like, I get it, you got to push those
3687900	3692780	graphics and everything. But you got to develop something like the meta quests, like, honestly,
3692780	3700060	because that is as much as I hate meta, like, that piece of hardware is like my kids play that
3700060	3706540	all the time, like all the time. And they love it's just so easy to use. And it's it's decent
3706540	3712780	enough to run games in, you know, pretty decent games. So all they need to do is just something
3712780	3718220	like that that's not attached to a $500 console. And I get it like, you know, it pushes the
3718220	3722540	graphics and stuff, but is it really worth it to like be that high end on that? Because like,
3722540	3726940	you're really narrowing the market. Like if you expand it, make it more broad, you can have that
3726940	3732380	thing take off like, you know, imagine Sony titles on like, you know, a quest type of product
3732380	3737180	where it's easy, you know, it's like a couple 100 bucks to get in and then you're playing the Sony
3737180	3742700	catalog stuff like that's what they need to do not wall it off with $1,000 worth of how well is
3742700	3749340	that going to work for for Apple with their thing like that's an amazing piece of hardware. But it's
3749340	3754620	just like no one's gonna buy it because it's so expensive. And that's the thing. It's we're
3754620	3758860	waiting for all these prices to come down. It's just, I don't know, I think they need to do
3758860	3762540	something that's its own thing. I want to get a couple other comments out here. And then I'll
3762540	3767340	move on to the next story for time. But crystal skies in our chat. Hello. Hello says they need
3767340	3772620	to make it backwards compatible, you know. And that was a problem is that they did make a
3772620	3777180	hardware design choice to it. They can't make it backwards compatible because the VR works in a
3777180	3782540	completely different way. And that's why you're seeing things like no man's sky, Tetris effect
3782540	3787020	and things getting like re released for PS VR, too, because they really are new releases,
3787020	3792380	because they have to adapt to the new way that PlayStation VR to handles VR versus the first
3792380	3797820	that was a choice they made. And you know, I, I get why they did it, because that's where the
3797820	3802780	tech is going. And it does allow them, you know, probably a better VR experience at the end of the
3802780	3807420	day. But yeah, it does suck. Like it's just like that. And that's the way a lot of people see it
3807660	3809820	is that comment right there. So yes,
3810460	3814860	yeah, it's the problem is what it's always been is some of these consoles that they put out,
3814860	3820380	you know, and I'm considering this like a console almost for Sony is they don't have the must have
3820380	3826780	system seller game on it. I'm sorry, the horizon game. That wasn't it. Like that was just not
3826780	3831340	experience, though. I did get to mess around that it's Yeah, and Bobby and Chad says the tech and
3831340	3836940	PS VR two is pretty good. It really is. Like if they just would put the first party games behind
3837020	3841820	it to really sell it, like give it a half life Alex or something, you know,
3841820	3846380	like a God of War game, like where your cradles and you're throwing the axe and stuff like that,
3846380	3851980	like that could be really sweet. Give it a Spider Man game like is swinging around on a web and
3851980	3858220	stuff like that. It sounds motion see your I get it. I get it. But like, some people might like
3858220	3865580	that. Like you could do something like that. It would be really cool and just but it's unfortunately
3865580	3869660	it's gonna go the way like a lot of these Sony products do is where they just kind of forget
3869660	3875500	about it and it goes off and then we're like, you know, several summer game fests down the road and
3875500	3879500	we're like, Hey, where's all those PlayStation VR two titles and then the next thing you know,
3879500	3885260	oh, yeah, we stopped supporting it. What Vita you know, one more comment in chat here. Shane says
3885260	3889820	PS VR two already feels dead. They never talk about it. I don't even know about things coming
3889820	3893740	out for it because they don't talk about it. I can't follow every developer making games for it.
3893740	3901180	So the games just go unnoticed since Sony ignores it. Ouch, but true. All right, let's move on. Our
3901180	3906140	next story is about kind of an update. Excuse me to something we talked about two weeks ago on the
3906140	3912700	show. And that is the fact that as we know, Charles Martinet will no longer be voicing Mario. There is
3912700	3916620	a new voice actor in Mario wonder they are still not saying who that is. I guess we just get to
3916620	3920540	find out when the credits roll in the game. What if it's the Final Fantasy 16 guy?
3920940	3926780	Oh, it's not it's not. And like I said, I, I understand why they kind of are keeping it under
3926780	3933020	wraps because that person is going to get bullied, unfortunately, and it sucks and they shouldn't I
3933020	3939020	want to make it very clear that type of behavior online is fucked up. But unfortunately, they don't
3939020	3944140	get but if they're not, they will you you hang out on Twitter, they're absolutely going to get
3944140	3949020	bullied because they're not Charles Martinet. They're gonna because the environment created on
3949020	3954860	Twitter by the person that runs Twitter only lends itself to hyper focusing that environment.
3955500	3960300	They have to be on Twitter. I hopefully they're not just not making an account there that that
3960300	3966300	would be the smart move. Yes. I agree with that. I mean, more and more and more people even,
3966300	3973420	you know, verified people are leaving the platform anyway. So I, I don't know. Um,
3974380	3981900	I honestly think that there'll be those of us who are like, I'd say the true fan. But those who will
3981900	3990220	be like, welcome to the family. Yeah, you know, I am I would rather focus on, you know, I think that
3990220	3994860	if the people who are like welcoming speak louder than the people who are haters, and that's going
3994860	3999660	to make all the difference. That's a very good point is that, you know, we can, you know, send
3999740	4004860	some love to counteract all of that negativity that we know is coming. The part I want to say
4004860	4008540	with that, though, is that I don't think it's a good decision on Nintendo's part to make people
4008540	4014060	wait until the credits because that information will get leaked as soon as those press coffees
4014060	4018220	are out there coffees copies are out there, it doesn't matter what embargo you put on it,
4018220	4023740	that name will leak out. So Nintendo, my question to you is, do you want to control the narrative?
4023740	4028140	Or do you want Twitter to control the narrative? Because right now, out of Doug Bowser's mouth,
4028140	4032220	I'm hearing I want Twitter to control the narrative. I think that's a poor decision.
4032220	4039420	So I do hope Nintendo will allow this new voice actor to be properly introduced before the game
4039420	4045260	comes out. But that's my thought. But anyway, a nice video that they did do was that they
4045260	4050780	actually did a video with Charles Martinet and Miyamoto. There wasn't really new information
4050780	4054620	in it. They were just kind of, you know, talking about Charles Martinet's new roles, the ambassador,
4054620	4058460	and you kind of got to hear it out of his mouth where Charles Martinet was like,
4058460	4063020	hey, I'm really happy to be doing this role. It's been an honor to be voicing Mario for years,
4063020	4066700	but I'm so excited to come to conventions and meet all of you. It was a very nice thing. It
4066700	4071500	was the kind of thing where I'm kind of surprised they didn't release that with the news two weeks
4071500	4077420	ago. But okay, it is what it is. And it's coming out now. Plus, I think I think it was very nice
4077420	4084060	of Charles Martinet to be a good sport. Because technically, he wasn't required to be but I get
4084060	4089740	that he wants to continue this good relationship with Nintendo. And he, you know, to be fair to
4089740	4095180	Nintendo, they were treating him better than unfortunately, a lot of voice actors get treated
4095180	4099500	in this industry. Like I was literally just looking at Jennifer Hale's Twitter the other day,
4099500	4103740	and she just casually said, Oh, yeah, I got replaced on this cartoon I was on because they
4103740	4108460	didn't want to pay union rates anymore. She's like, and that's, you know, that's how I found
4108460	4112620	out when the new season got announced with the with the new voice actors, you know, and so a lot
4112620	4117340	of voice actors are not treated very kindly in this industry. So I will give credit to Nintendo
4117340	4123100	that like they they made a decision. They're sticking to it. They're handling it with grace
4123100	4129580	best they can. So I will give them all of that. But like I said two weeks ago, if you really want
4129580	4133100	to show Charles Martinet how much you love him, pay him for a monograph when he comes to your
4133100	4137020	town. Pay him for an autograph and a selfie when it comes to your town. That is the best way to
4137020	4145420	express your love. So there you go. Ah, yeah, thank you. Totally spies. Thank you, Rama.
4145420	4151660	Appreciate that. Anyway, let's move on. We have some more news. Dark Sakura.
4156140	4166460	There we go. Now my unmute button is working. So I heard you. So this is a I mean, honestly,
4166460	4173260	I'm not surprised by it because it's Nintendo. But they have said that there are no plans
4173260	4182140	for any DLC for Tears of the Kingdom. I mean, they hardly had DLC for Breath of the Wild. So
4182140	4187980	I wasn't expecting anything. I always expect Nintendo to bring out, you know, if they're doing
4187980	4194860	a game. They're going to do a whole game. Breath of the Wild had DLC. Breath of the Wild had DLC.
4194860	4198380	I said it had it barely had deals. Oh, you're right. Yeah, barely.
4199580	4203260	I also just found a string piece of string cheese that's been on my desk since last night. Oops.
4204460	4208540	Here's some deals right there. It's an unopened string cheese. But anyway, back to this.
4210620	4215580	Basically, and this is the quote from Al Numa. There are no plans to release additional content
4215580	4220300	this time because I feel like I've done everything I can to create games in that world.
4220860	4226300	In the first place, the reason why we chose this time as a sequel to the previous game is because
4226300	4229980	we thought there would be value experience and new kind of play in that place in Hyrule.
4230620	4236540	Then, if such a reason is newly born, it may return to the same world again. This is translation
4236540	4241340	clearly. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play. So
4241340	4247180	I'd be happy if you could look forward to it. Translation is we don't want to provide you with
4247180	4251580	more items to build things out of because you've already made so many pornographic things already.
4257260	4265020	No, I just think that when Nintendo puts out a game, a first party game,
4267020	4274060	they tend to put out a fairly complete project that fulfills the goal they set out as far as
4274060	4281740	storytelling and experience. I don't know, I've never expected DLC with first party Nintendo
4281740	4288780	games. When the stuff came out for Breath of the Wild, I was pretty surprised, honestly.
4291260	4296700	It's not something like Splatoon that would be something that's a continuous, ongoing,
4296700	4303260	non-singular story. This is its own entity. Honestly,
4304700	4309660	I have no problem with this. Y'all ain't entitled to extra shit, y'all.
4310380	4315500	I actually would love to see DLC on older games, like the original Zelda,
4315500	4320700	let's give me a third and fourth quest, or new characters to play as.
4320700	4324380	You know the fan community is already taking care of that with the randomizers.
4324380	4329340	I get that. I get that. But it would still be cool. They do the save, save things,
4329340	4333420	which is fine. But it would be really cool to just, okay, let's do these things that we can
4333420	4338060	push. We couldn't have done on the Nintendo because we didn't have the memory space,
4338060	4341900	but now we can push it. DLC for Animal Crossing for GameCube.
4341900	4347260	Super Mario 35 is what I'm hearing. That technically is the old game with the new
4347260	4352060	twist, right? Which I don't know why it was limited time. And you know there's rumors,
4352060	4356300	rumors that F F zero is going to get a 99 game.
4360140	4364860	But I definitely agree with what Jamie said about like, Nintendo games are,
4365900	4369500	it's an accurate statement, Nintendo games are pretty fully featured. And we don't,
4369500	4374460	we think of Nintendo as a company that releases relatively bug free, like I shouldn't say 100%
4374460	4379340	bug free, relatively, yeah, relatively, compared to some of their peers. They do very good with
4379340	4382220	that and always doing like a fully featured type of product.
4383100	4387340	If something's going to have that Nintendo seal of approval on it, it's going to have earned it.
4387340	4393100	But that that is true. And I would say it's also true that when they do decide to do DLC,
4393100	4398380	it's also a pretty rich and excited like, you know, like, you know, the Breath of the Wild.
4398380	4401740	So I can see where maybe there's that disappointment of like, ah, Nintendo set the
4401740	4406540	bar so high with DLC, it's a bummer, they're not going to go through it with this. But it's not
4406540	4410220	like it's going to hurt the game in the long run, because the game itself is fully one of these
4410220	4413740	days, I'll get around to playing it is fully featured. And you know, you're not going to be
4413740	4418860	disappointed. And it's because they're working on a switch to anyway, like at this point, like,
4419900	4424060	you're not going to do it because the switch to would be out by the time this DLC would
4424060	4426540	hypothetical DLC would come out anyway. So they're just
4427260	4429580	releasing a Breath of the Wild.
4429580	4433980	No, that's true. Well, Breath of the Wild ended up being a dual release. So yeah,
4434620	4439740	they could they could, you know, date, they may say that, yeah, we're not releasing DLC.
4441100	4447980	There could be a special edition that comes out that has more content in it. That's technically
4447980	4454620	not DLC and technically is the best type of being right. 100 clip that we're going to be watching
4454620	4459260	this in six months when that's true. That is it. That's why there's no DLC.
4459260	4462220	Hmm. Maybe.
4462220	4466860	Maybe. All right. Well, since we brought up switch to why don't we go to our next big rumor?
4467500	4469020	Well, okay.
4469020	4470220	Well, I'm sorry. Was there more?
4471020	4475900	Well, I know I had another another thought about it, too, is just that
4475900	4478940	Sorry, it's harder for me to see the avatar raising a hand than a real person. So
4480940	4484780	it's okay. It's just that I forgot what I was gonna say. So nevermind.
4485820	4486320	Okay.
4486560	4490240	I got totally distracted off of my thought.
4490880	4498320	Okay. So there's rumors that last month during Gamescom that developers were shown a switch
4498320	4506640	to behind closed doors. Basically, allegedly, yes, your gamer had said that partners were shown tech
4506640	4513920	demos of how well the system is designed to run. And is there is one such demo was a souped up
4513920	4524480	version of Zelda Breath of the Wild. Ironic, ironic that they would be doing that. Lots of
4525520	4531600	rumors regarding specs and stuff that I've seen too. But I don't want to speculate in specs,
4531600	4536320	ray tracing and DLSS and all that stuff like that. We'll see what they come out with
4536320	4540720	when they announce it, which will happen eventually, after the holiday.
4540720	4544480	Yeah, I mean, they're not gonna cannibalize holiday sales. No way I have anything about
4544480	4551520	this. No, it's not holiday for sure. I mean, it next year, maybe. Next holiday, possibly.
4552160	4561120	But yeah, I mean, we'll see. We'll see. Dr. CSA, supposedly, it ran the UE five matrix demo. Well,
4561120	4564560	that the rumor, you know, I know, you don't want to get into specs. I understand why it's all
4564560	4570400	rumor anyway. But the rumors are saying it's PlayStation five level quality, but able to do
4570400	4575040	what the switch does, which would be pretty impressive, if true. That would be cool. Yeah,
4575040	4581280	I don't believe it. But that would be cool. Yeah, I take this as a very big grain of salt. I mean,
4581280	4586560	what I don't take with a grain of salt, a switch to is coming. Absolutely. The grain of salt part
4586560	4591920	is I think Nintendo is probably still trying to finalize those specs. And I think maybe I would
4591920	4597280	believe that they showed it to trusted partners at Gamescom to get feedback on some of that.
4597280	4603040	What would it take? What what kind of power do you need to bring us this game on the console?
4603040	4608720	What do you need to do this sort of thing? I think the specs are still being negotiated. And they
4608720	4613840	might have shown the higher end of things. But I don't think that necessarily means it's the final
4613840	4620800	product. So yeah, there's a lot a lot of that stuff still to be figured out. Okay, another
4620800	4626800	thing that kind of dates back to Gamescom a little bit, but this was this Pikmin Finder AR
4626800	4632560	game that came out. It's not Pikmin Bloom. And it's not Pokemon Go. But it's another Nintendo
4632560	4638000	and Niantic partnership. It's Pikmin Finder. It's an AR game that lets you scan the environment for
4638000	4644880	Pikmin and treasures. There's a little link, it's pikmin-finder.nintendo.net. And you go on it on
4644880	4649520	your mobile device, you do a little QR code. And that's that's how you get it all started.
4650640	4655120	Essentially, honestly, I haven't really played around with this because it's just a way to just
4655120	4659760	scan the environment that they're trying to like scan people into like doing more 3D scans of
4659760	4665280	locations and stuff like that. No, but Niantic also already has a game like this called Peridot
4665280	4671680	that they put out. And I played Peridot for about a week. And because there's there's no game there.
4671680	4676560	It's one of those things that's like, oh, that's interesting for about three days. And then you're
4676560	4684800	like, okay, I've seen it all done. And the the monetization in that game is horrific. Horrific.
4685840	4691360	So I I'm, you know, you all know, I used to bang the drum on Niantic games here. I just want to
4691360	4697840	point out I'm uninstalling some of their games left and right. I my, my subscription in Ingress
4697840	4702720	lapsed yesterday. For those of you that didn't think I meant it when I said that a few weeks ago,
4702720	4707040	I no longer have a subscription Ingress core or whatever, whatever the the thing is, it's gone.
4707680	4715840	So but I am for because I recognize that I like to gamify my fitness. I do still play Pokemon Go
4715840	4722640	and I play Pikmin Bloom. I haven't given any of those games a red cent since the incident
4722640	4727280	happened where I reported a cheater and nothing was done about it. And I'm over it. I'm not I'm
4727280	4734960	not supporting this system that is weekly and that does not have enforcement behind it. So anyway,
4736800	4742080	and as far as this demo goes, I mean, I'm sure it's cute, but it's probably cute for five minutes.
4742080	4746960	And I've already seen that Niantic has been pushing this technology for quite some time now
4746960	4751760	between Peridot and some of these other things. It's time to show how you can actually make a fun
4751760	4759120	game out of it. Because Peridot isn't it. So show us. I'm going to just be very blunt. Show us the
4759120	4766480	fucking point. You know, like, like, I don't know, the not a Nintendo game, I would still love them
4766480	4771760	to see see something like elements member elements. That was a fun game from Konami.
4772800	4775920	Like, they should do something like that. Like, that'd be cool. Maybe I guess that's
4775920	4779120	almost like Pikmin, you know, finding stuff hidden in your environment. But
4780000	4787120	yeah, I don't know. Niantic is kind of out of ideas, I guess they like the license and make
4787120	4792800	shells of like games. They have some gameplay to them. But you know, it's basically monetization
4792800	4798080	machines. I and I've said this before, and I'm going to be very careful not to repeat myself. But
4798080	4802800	the problem is, is that they are married to their mission statement more than they're married to
4802800	4807840	their player base. That's a problem. The reason why that's happening is because the individual
4807840	4812720	running the company is he is a smart guy. He's a brilliant mind. This is the guy behind Google
4812720	4817680	Maps. He's done a lot of very smart things. You know what he hasn't done run a game company.
4818480	4824240	And that's the other problem. So what are you? Are you a game company? Or are you a get out and
4824240	4830960	explore the world company? Because it's starting to show that being both of those things is very,
4830960	4837520	very difficult. So get the help you need, or admit that you're not a game company because you're not
4837520	4844160	running it like one. Anyway, let's move on to our next story. Dark Sakura.
4846160	4852480	So there's finally a specific home port of a game, but not quite how you think it's going to be.
4852480	4860400	So Daytona USA two is finally coming home, but it's because it's built in to like a dragon guy
4861040	4871120	the man who erased his name. So I mean, the other game had some old Sega titles in it. So this one
4871120	4879920	is Daytona USA two, but it's going to be under the non-licensed name Sega Racing Classic two.
4881600	4888480	And then also in the game is going to be Fighting Vipers two and some Master System ports of Flicky
4888480	4896720	and Galaxy Force. The game will be out on November 9th this year. But I mean,
4896720	4902560	I would just like them to go. I just want more Sega ages and bring something like that back out.
4902560	4911120	Like legit, the Yakuza Sega arcade stuff is really cool. Like I would love like a Sega arcade that
4911120	4915680	has like all of what they've done throughout that series, like in one package. And I think
4915680	4923440	they could sell that and it would work. Yeah. It's so weird that like a modern AAA game nowadays can
4923440	4930960	put, you know, older games that they publish into the game and not charge people extra for that
4930960	4936640	Nintendo. Sega does what Nintendo don't. Oh, come back. Yep.
4936640	4947200	I love it. So, so I think the real question and I bet Bobby would want to know the answer
4947200	4951760	to this Dark Sakura. Could this with this getting the home port, everything is, is this how you
4951760	4961760	might play Yakuza? Um, did I ever say I wasn't gonna play it? Oh, okay. Just I mean, I have,
4961760	4969840	I have a I'm on a Mac. There's no way for me to play it. Oh, yeah. Because I, I feel like
4969840	4974240	like a dragon was I could be wrong was on state but it's cloud gaming is probably the way to do
4974240	4982080	it. No, it came out after stadia shut down. And I mean, it might be on GeForce now. I mean,
4982080	4990720	I don't know. But um, I never said I was never gonna play it. It's Halo I won't play.
4992720	5000640	To screw Halo. All right, uh, next story Loki. So apparently the announcement is that
5000640	5008880	Neetara is back and being up at being played by Megan Fox. So she's not only going to be doing
5008880	5012800	the voice for the character, but also doing the mocap for it as well, which is pretty cool.
5013600	5018160	And you know, she of course, in the reveal trailer said, you know, she comes from this weird realm.
5018160	5022800	She's the type of vampire creature. She's evil, but she's also good. She's trying to save her
5022800	5029200	people. I really like her. She's a vampire, which obviously resonates for whatever reason. Is it
5029200	5036240	because you're a vampire Megan Fox? Are you a vampire? She also said that I'm not really
5036240	5044160	voicing it. She's kind of me. So that's kind of funny. Because she's a vampire. She is a vampire
5044160	5052640	confirmed Megan Fox vampire. Wow. Megan Fox is so goth you all she's so goth. No, I think it's
5052640	5057840	cool. It's whatever. I like to watch the trailer for we're actually playing it on b roll right
5057840	5062240	now. So yeah, I mean, no, I mean, I mean, but like, hear her voice. Yeah, no, I'm poking,
5062240	5067280	I'm poking fun at it. But like, I do think it's cool. Like it is a good job. Yeah. No,
5067280	5071760	and I like that, like, you know, Hollywood or like, you know, classic Hollywood or
5071760	5076000	ever want to call it is crossing over more and more into games like this. Because,
5076000	5081600	you know, we all remember a day when games were like you, you wouldn't see trip. Well,
5081600	5087280	I don't know if Megan Fox is triple A, but she's probably at least a, you know, a list movie stars
5087280	5092400	participating in things like this. And now it's it's kind of a grand theft auto or something. Yeah,
5092400	5097600	it's very commonplace. So I think it's cool. Did you also see the what the other thing coming out
5097600	5104880	from Mortal Kombat one is the other skin for Johnny Cage. Oh, it's Van Damme. Yeah, yeah.
5104880	5112160	Which is. And I think that is him doing the voicing, I think. Yeah. He was supposed to
5112160	5117440	originally have been the character that Johnny Cage became. Yeah. How full circle is that?
5118240	5121920	I completely forgot that Jean-Claude Van Damme was doing that. That's awesome.
5121920	5124480	Yeah. Yeah, that's really cool. There's there's honestly
5125200	5130800	some pretty good talent involved in that game. Yeah, we finally got our street fighter cross
5130800	5137600	Mortal Kombat now. This is not how we thought. But you know how fun. Oh, that means somebody
5137600	5144240	could do that in Mugen. They could take guile versus Johnny Cage, both Jean-Claude Van Damme
5144240	5148400	and we could finally see that back. You know, that's coming. Let's see a lot of comments and
5148400	5153520	chat lighting up about this crystal skies and chat says, I mean, JK Simmons and Jason Isaacs
5153520	5159120	in Baldur's Gate 3 is amazing. Yes. Keep in mind. JK Simmons in anything is awesome.
5159120	5165840	Jason Isaacs was also in Midnight Sons, Marvel's Midnight Sons as Mafisto and he was perfect.
5166560	5171280	Also something to keep in mind with the strike going on right now, video games are something
5171280	5175920	that they that celebrities can work with. The screen actors can work, at least for now. Yes,
5175920	5180480	I've heard about the whole voting in advance of, you know, to authorize a strike. I'm well aware
5180480	5184480	of that situation, but we haven't heard of a strike being authorized on the games industry
5184480	5189760	yet. So for now, you know, screen actors still work there. I wonder if we're not going to see
5189760	5194800	more of these types of collaborations, you know, in a year, a year and a half's time because
5195360	5199520	it allows some of the actors to work. Could be very interesting. See what that happens.
5201040	5205440	Also, Questbuster in chat warns, in addition to the Mortal Kombat 1 story,
5205440	5209840	the full story was already leaked and exists in clips out there. So watch out.
5209840	5214480	Yeah, well, that that game is also out this coming week, I think very soon. Yeah,
5214480	5218000	if you have the collector's editions on the 15th, otherwise you gotta wait until
5218640	5223920	next Tuesday. It's still not very long. It's, uh, they're very good at announcing those games
5223920	5230000	and then they're coming out like three months later. So yeah. All right. Well, let's talk about
5230000	5234320	a game that's gonna, that did not get a similar announcement pattern because we don't know when
5234320	5240640	this game is ever going to come out. Uh, but it is Elder Scrolls 6 and the news about exclusiveness
5240640	5249280	is back in the news. Um, because it has to do with, um, uh, I think this is evidence that went
5249280	5255840	in with Microsoft's battle with the FTC. There was some vagueness about if this game would be
5255840	5261520	Xbox only because of course they don't want the courts to think, you know, there's going to be
5261520	5267840	antitrust problems or whatever. So they say, um, with Elder Scrolls 6, it's so far out. It's hard
5267840	5273120	to understand what the platforms will even be. We're talking about a game that's five plus years
5273120	5278320	away. Remember that? Well, in an interview with Bloomberg this week, Phil Spencer was asked to
5278320	5283760	get about Elder Scrolls 6 saying, we looked at it on a case by case basis with the games we build.
5283760	5288400	We want to make sure our games are available in so many different places on our Xbox consoles,
5288400	5293520	on PC, also via cloud. These games can come to almost any web enabled device.
5293520	5297760	We're looking at millions and millions of players who will have access to star field and other Xbox
5297760	5302640	game studios games. It's really about giving players choice around how they want to play
5302640	5310560	and build their library games. I mean, like, look, he answered it in that quote right there.
5310560	5314640	And this is the thing I understand this doesn't generate clicks for your website and all that
5314640	5320960	stuff, but really look at what he's saying. And he can't, he can't say it so explicitly because
5320960	5325680	there are still court things going on with Microsoft. Granted, Microsoft says Microsoft
5325680	5330480	Bethesda was settled a long time ago, but they're still trying to project this image of, oh yeah,
5330480	5334560	we were going to put our games everywhere. Activision, Blizzard come be a part of that.
5334560	5337920	Yeah. You know, they want to project that image to all these regulatory bodies around the world.
5337920	5343040	So he can't be explicit yet. If you read between the lines in that comment, he literally says
5343680	5351040	between Xbox on the way between Xbox cloud, Xbox system and PC, we're going to get this
5351040	5356800	game everywhere. We don't need PlayStation five. That's right. He's saying without saying.
5357600	5362400	Yeah. And, and nor should the FTC be like suggesting that they need to put that game
5362400	5368480	on a PlayStation console because like, I'm sorry, Sony, they're not publishing Spiderman on Xbox.
5368480	5372720	Like why, why the double standards here? Like, I don't even understand why they would push that.
5372960	5378240	And I'm sure that somebody in the FTP or FTC is just not clear enough to realize that like
5378240	5383120	a Bethesda game is not an Activision game. And it's completely two different scenarios here, but
5384240	5389680	yeah, it's, it's even, it's a stupid thing to even inquire about. Like, I don't understand.
5390560	5398880	So elder scrolls six is exclusive to Microsoft. I guarantee it. That's like, I don't know why
5398880	5405040	we're continuing to debate this. It's it's look at what they're saying. It's going to be exclusive
5405040	5410240	a hundred percent, especially the way he compares it to starfield. Hello. Starfield just went
5410240	5416320	through this exact same, uh, speculation and questions and talk arounds and all this stuff.
5416320	5421840	And what happened? It's exclusive elder scroll six will be. And, and, and that's okay.
5421840	5426560	Microsoft is buying these big companies so they can have exclusives to take on
5426560	5432400	Sony's what Sony's got and refuses to put out on all of their devices. That's another
5432400	5437360	interesting thing. Well, nevermind. We'll, we'll go to that another day. All right. Moving on.
5437360	5444080	Let's, let's, let's go back to a, a more classic time in this next segment as we usually do.
5444080	5460400	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out
5460400	5466560	a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. All right. But
5466560	5473040	dark soccer, you have a classic non game tonight, if I remember right. So what did you pick for us
5473040	5481200	tonight? I picked connect for another game that has made enemies of entire families.
5482720	5489760	So, um, it has gone by other names, uh, not just connect for, with the number four or spelled out
5489760	5497680	four, but four up plot for fine for captain's mistress four in a row, drop four and gravitrix
5497680	5501040	in the Soviet union. I'm only going to call it captain's mistress from now on.
5502000	5509440	I'm kind of down for that. Um, but at any rate, um, you have two colors and your goal is to make
5509440	5518960	four in a row, either, um, uh, you know, uh, right up, uh, vertically horizontal or diagonally. Um,
5520000	5529520	and, uh, basically it's already what's referred to as a solved game, meaning that it's one that
5529520	5539360	you can predict as long as people play perfectly. Um, now, um, the, uh, the thing about this one
5539360	5547280	is that the official connect for trademark came out in February, 1974 by Milton Bradley. But
5547280	5554080	the theories behind the game have already existed well before that. So I don't know if anyone
5554080	5559840	remembers the pretty sneaky CIS commercial, cause they redid that commercial a couple of times in
5559840	5565760	the history of that game. Um, but as it said in that commercial connect four of your checkers
5565760	5570240	in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same, but look out, your opponent can sneak up
5570240	5581280	on you and win the game. Um, so it actually has a lot more to go with a little bit of a mathematical,
5582240	5590800	uh, uh, theory behind it. Um, it's what's referred to also as a zero-sum game.
5593520	5601440	Yeah, that, that's, that's the commercial. Um, meaning that, um, there are two sides,
5601440	5609040	but one is strictly advantaged and one is strictly disadvantaged. So, um, but the first time the game
5609040	5616960	was ever solved, like completely was, uh, by James Dow Allen on October 1st, 1988,
5616960	5626000	and then independently by Victor Alice on October 16th, 1988. And it basically was by developing
5626000	5634560	strategy to mathematically figure out where the, uh, the items should fall to get a perfect,
5634560	5644880	a perfect game. Um, and, uh, they actually, they've even, um, had AI applied to it to figure
5644880	5653520	out all the various, uh, different formulas that could be used to decide optimal gameplay. Um, but
5653520	5657120	the biggest thing with the connect four is that honestly, the first one who does it first
5657120	5663600	is the winner, you know, who makes, who makes it, uh, we used to play like, um,
5663600	5668240	not the first person to get the four, but how many could you get out of the board,
5669360	5672240	you know? So it was, it was pretty, pretty interesting.
5672240	5675760	Oh, like how many four connections could you get once all the pieces were played?
5676640	5677040	Exactly.
5677040	5679120	Oh, that's an interesting little house rule. I like that.
5679920	5685520	Yeah. So, um, there are other variations of the game that have different board sizes and
5685520	5693040	game pieces and rules and stuff like that. Um, the variations, um, are really good for,
5693040	5700880	you know, again, folks who use, you know, AI for, uh, for, uh, projections and, um, game theorists.
5701440	5709280	So the most common board is, uh, seven columns by six rows. Variations can be five by four,
5709280	5715360	six by five, eight by seven, nine by seven, 10 by seven, eight by eight and infinite connect four,
5716160	5720400	and then cylinder infinite connect four, which I haven't seen either of those.
5721200	5730160	Um, so basically though, you're pretty much going, you know, just, just drop it in,
5730160	5736960	see what happens. So, um, there are other, uh, variations, like I was saying, pop out,
5737520	5743120	darts traditionally the same way, but, um, you, you know, you alternate your pieces,
5743120	5748240	everyone takes their turn, but during each term, a player can either add another disc from the top,
5748240	5755600	or if one has any discs of their own color on the bottom row, they can pop out that disc instead.
5756320	5760960	And so it drops down everything from above it, you know, kind of like clearing out a Tetris line.
5761760	5769920	Um, they also pop 10, which, um, you set up your discs into the slot filling up from only
5769920	5776160	the bottom row and then moving on until the next row is filled. So you're, you're doing your four
5776160	5784880	like that. There's also five in a row, of course, played on a six by nine grid. Um, power up, which
5784880	5792320	is, um, like they have like a power checkers piece, um, where you can choose to play it once
5792320	5797440	per game. And it has an anvil icon. If you play like one with an anvil icon, you have to pop out
5797440	5803200	all the pieces below it. Um, you know, just different, different variations like that.
5803200	5809760	So as far as, um, other versions of the game, there's a giant connect four, and we actually
5809760	5819680	see someone who has constructed one. Um, there, yeah, this is the largest version. Um, it has made
5819680	5826000	from weather resistant wood and measures 120 centimeters in both width and height. Um, it was
5826000	5832880	released for the Microvision video game console in 1997, uh, developed by Robert Hofburg. And it was
5832880	5840720	also released on the TI 99 for computer. I have played that one. Um, in 1979, of course I, I was
5841280	5847680	a little bit older when I played it. Um, it also, I mean, one of the fun things about it is that
5847680	5852640	you can just play a very quick game. There's travel versions of it. There's also another
5852640	5860880	one they made in 2007 called connect for stackers, which instead of the grid, um, you have a board
5860880	5868160	that you're placing your discs on. Um, there's also a physical game called connect four by four,
5869040	5875040	where it has two layer vertical grid with colored discs for four players plus blocking discs.
5875840	5882080	Um, in 2013, Baytech games released, uh, a connect for ticket redemption, arcade game
5882080	5887840	under license by Hasbro, uh, 2015 winning moves published connect for twist and turn
5888800	5894800	where you have a game tower instead of a grid. And it has five rings that twist independently.
5894800	5901040	Sounds complicated. And then Baytech games in 2018 released a connect for arcade game called
5901040	5906080	connect for hoops where you throw basketballs and then they show up as checkers on the screen.
5906960	5914240	Um, so moving, uh, a little bit, a little bit past that, um, oh, actually I take that back.
5914560	5920800	Um, there was connect for shots released by Hasbro in 2018, where you have to bounce the
5920800	5927280	colored balls onto a grid until you achieve four in a row. So to go into some pop culture stuff,
5927280	5934000	um, uh, Stuart Mcconey, while working with NME, uh, started a rumor that connect for was invented
5934000	5943120	by David Bowie. Nope. On, uh, the hubs show Friday game night, there is a game, uh, called connect
5943120	5949120	for basketball. So you use basketballs to play Nintendo did a version of this called four in a
5949120	5956000	row, um, for their tabletop games compilation and clubhouse games, 51 worldwide classics for the
5956000	5964560	switch. And then a game, uh, a way out, uh, you can play connect for as a mini game. And there you go.
5965280	5972480	All right. Your classic non-video game of the month connect for great choice. Um,
5972480	5978400	have you ever played? Oh, what's that? I was just going to say, can you guess anything that's next?
5978400	5982720	Do you want to hazard a guess? I mean, I think I've shown you the list, but no, I don't think
5982720	5992080	I've seen the list. So you have not know. So, um, yeah. Whatever could be happening, whatever could
5992080	5997760	it be? We'll find out. We'll find out soon. Um, a couple of things, Jamie, I lost your avatar.
5997760	6000960	I don't know if it's because I was running B roll or something, but I'm getting the squares
6000960	6005440	on discord. I don't know what's going on. Sorry. Um, and, uh, what was the other thing I was going
6005440	6010640	to say? Oh, have you, the last time I played connect for was actually, have you ever played
6010640	6016320	the one they have at the bolt, which for those not, yeah. Yeah. For those not from this town is
6016320	6022560	kind of the local, uh, uh, daddy bar, I guess, but it's pretty welcoming to all walks of life.
6022560	6029120	Um, but it's, uh, they gotta, they have one of those giant connect fours. So, um, it always that
6029120	6033360	and the Jenga always makes a big thud when the game's over. Cause they have one of those life
6033360	6038640	sized Jenga's out there too. And, uh, they're always making gigantic noise when they fall apart.
6038640	6046480	So yeah. Hmm. All right. I do not know what's going on with this thing. Cause I have it set to
6046480	6054400	not put the stupid little camo thing on my window and it still does it. Um, during that segment,
6054400	6058800	somebody in chat reminded me of a big headline that we didn't have on our list tonight. So I
6058800	6062480	hope you won't mind me adding something here on the fly, but I think this is worth bringing up.
6062480	6069120	And that is, uh, the announcement that read pop and the ESA have broken up. Uh, they will not be,
6069120	6073840	yeah. Read pop and the ESA have broken up. They will not be working on E3 next year.
6074480	6079840	And, uh, it has already been announced. The ESA has informed the LA convention center
6079840	6085520	that there will not be an in-person show in 2024. That is because if you listen to what I said
6085600	6092560	earlier this year, there will never be another E3. Uh, look, we talked a lot about this,
6092560	6098560	but, um, E3 is, is long since dead and gone, but I am, I am actually legitimately surprised by this
6098560	6104560	news because I thought for sure this was just, Oh, read pops just going to produce E3 as a fan
6104560	6110000	convention like packs or have E3 at packs. But even that has apparently fallen apart
6110000	6117040	for whatever reason. I wonder if the ESA is really hard-headed and that they really think
6117040	6126400	they're going to get a show at the LA convention center again. Um, I am left to not be sure what
6126400	6131200	else could be the possibility. Uh, the ESA has said in a statement, we appreciate read pops
6131200	6135760	partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans
6135760	6140720	together through their various events. While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry.
6142800	6147120	Let's let the crickets chirp for that one. We are continuing to explore how we can evolve it
6147120	6152160	to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event from format
6152160	6159360	to location. We're good at getting into physical magazine publication. That's a winning strategy
6159360	6164720	from format to location. So E3 is going to be moving from the LA convention center to
6164720	6169840	the banquet room at Applebee's. Um, we are committed to our role as a, uh,
6169840	6175120	kind of vendor, Kevin, or for the industry convener airport Hilton, and, uh, look forward
6175120	6185040	to sharing news about E3 in the coming months. Hmm. Very interesting. Um, I was just curious
6185040	6189120	about something when bringing this whole thing up. So let me actually, I just wanted to check out,
6189120	6195120	uh, yeah, I'm doing this live. I have no idea what to expect here. Um, so I'm actually looking
6195120	6201280	at the ESAs website right now, because I'm just kind of curious, like, what are some things that
6201280	6209120	the ESA has done for the industry? Okay, here we go in the news back on August 23rd, essential facts,
6209120	6214960	key findings. Okay. So they did a study, I guess that's something neat. And then we go back over
6215040	6220480	a month before that for their last big headline, July 20th gaming for everyone creating an
6220480	6224720	inclusive environment for a global player community. Well, yes, I agree with that games
6224720	6230720	are for everyone, but how did the ESA do that? Let's see. They gathered with experts, innovators
6230720	6236160	and change makers in New York's games for change festival. So the ESA didn't put it on. They went
6236160	6243680	somewhere else. They showed up. Showing up is really like the most important step, right?
6245920	6252160	The ESA is dead. They just don't know it yet. Don't tell them. All right, moving on. Let's
6252160	6258160	talk about some other news, uh, that happened this week rapidly in our industry with rapid fire news.
6258160	6262880	We'll, we'll give you some more headlines faster than the ESA will. Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.
6263840	6270880	Yes. So I am very excited about this. Uh, it is another thing that you can get to build a console.
6271760	6277520	So this is not necessarily coming from Lego this time, but it's mega blocks or I think it,
6277520	6280560	I don't know if it's mega blocks or mega constructs because they used to have the
6280560	6285680	constructs license as well, but mega block, I guess maybe they went back to that. Um,
6285680	6295440	they have a three to four or three fourth scale replica of the Xbox 360 and it is $150. It's 1400
6295440	6303920	pieces and it includes the Xbox 360 console, the controller and a replica of halo three,
6303920	6308640	the case and everything. Um, the thing that bothers me the most about this is the internals.
6308640	6314320	They do show that there's like actual, um, circuit boards and stuff on the inside and it does not
6314320	6323360	look like an Xbox 360. I have taken part so many of those. It's just, they kind of close ish.
6324320	6329440	It's, it's, you know, it's, it's, you tried it too. You tried, like they, they, they put
6329440	6333760	some things in there and they're like, yeah, I think it's like a Borgos or like, you know,
6333760	6341920	heatsink goes here. Some, some resistors go here close enough. Um, but I mean, it still looks cool.
6341920	6346000	Um, I don't know what everyone hates on mega blocks. I mean, they've got some pretty good
6346000	6351680	Pokemon, um, builds. I've done their like giant Pikachu thing that they did and that was pretty
6351680	6359440	sweet. Um, but yeah, it'll be out in October on the eighth and they had pre-orders for it.
6359440	6366080	It's exclusively at target and it's sold out already, but I'm in target all the time. So I
6366080	6370960	will just have to keep an eye out. Also, I have no room for this whatsoever, but.
6371920	6375280	We can just add that to the queue of unbuilt crap in our house.
6375360	6382640	Um, what is not included though with it is the ginormous immense brick of a power supply
6382640	6386480	that is not included with the kit. And fortunately that would have bumped up the
6386480	6389840	purchase price of $250 and they just weren't willing to do that.
6389840	6392480	Or a red filter. So you can create your red ring of death.
6393040	6399440	I do. Oh yes, that too. Um, yeah, it does light up. Um, I do like how the box though is the same
6399440	6404960	box as the Xbox three 60, which is pretty, pretty cool. So I do like that about it. Um,
6405680	6408960	is the original model or one of the slims is the original model, the original model.
6408960	6414080	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I'm, I'm pretty, you know, I did check it out. Um,
6415040	6420720	I don't, yeah, I it's a little pricey, but you know, it's, it's not too bad for 1400 pieces.
6422240	6429120	All right. What else? And then, uh, we've got more stuff coming to Nintendo switch online.
6429120	6435360	So this week we got a few, um, Game Boy, Nintendo, and super Nintendo games. Um,
6435360	6443520	starting with a quest for Camelot for the super Nintendo, uh, we have, uh, Kirby star stacker
6444320	6453600	and on the, um, for the NES and then also, uh, downtown and Nakatsu March super awesome
6453600	6460080	field day and joy mech fight. It's a CUNYO game. Yep. It is a CUNYO game.
6461040	6466720	And those are as well for the, uh, Nintendo or yeah, for the NES.
6468800	6477360	All right. Uh, what do you have? So I have, um, for fans of cold to the lamb, like myself,
6477920	6485840	uh, there is our custom controllers released that are available now, um, through a, uh,
6485840	6493840	a website, uh, for captain Alex CPT and Alex all inward, who's selling, uh, dual sense Xbox
6493840	6500240	controllers, joy con and pro controllers. And if you get one, you will also get like with,
6500240	6507440	with the special package, it's like 165 bucks for one. Um, but you can get a licensed custom
6507440	6512640	controller, premium packaging, a two inch hard enamel spinner pin that I kind of just
6512640	6520480	want the pin and a stainless steel authenticity card that is signed by captain Alex. And you can
6520480	6526320	just go to captain Alex.com to see what they are. I just want the pin. That's all.
6526320	6532960	All right. Well, uh, you heard about it in the intro and this is just so silly. We have to talk
6532960	6537840	about it, but you know what? Uh, who, who doesn't love video games more than cup noodle and, uh,
6537840	6541840	all of their various collaborations they do. I love all their collaborations. They can,
6542640	6549200	there's no collaboration that has been amazing. Well, they know that gamers apparently love cup
6549200	6552240	noodle, by the way, we are not being paid for this product placement. And I feel like we ought
6552240	6557760	to be, but it was reported on CNN. It's in the news. We should bring it up. The gaming cup noodle
6557760	6562320	is coming out in Japan. So it's not coming out here. Uh, but, uh, maybe Akuma JP is still out
6562320	6567760	there. It can get us some, uh, it is coming out on September 18th in Japan gaming cup noodle.
6567760	6573200	This is. It's also a rainbow colored package that looks really cute. I got to say it's why,
6573200	6580480	what makes it gaming cup noodle it's caffeinated, caffeinated ramen, but it's going to be available
6580560	6586880	in garlic, garlic, and black pepper yakisoba varieties, which both sound pretty good. Honestly,
6586880	6593200	uh, both versions are soup free. So, um, you don't have to worry about the soup spilling out and
6593200	6602080	over. I was, I was worried that there'd be soup in my soup. That's right. So, um, it's, you know,
6602640	6608560	again, obviously when this showed up in fall of SC 15, it was a huge hilarity.
6608560	6611920	They're just like, okay, let's, let's just take, we're going to take the soup.
6611920	6614320	Let's remove the soup, put caffeine in there instead.
6615360	6619360	Now it's gamers soup, but it's not soup. It doesn't make any sense,
6619360	6624320	but I love it because it's totally cup. It makes any sense. It's the most random
6624320	6630160	fucking thing in the world that I'm here for it. So, all right, let's check. This is the
6630160	6640560	type of leadership that we need for the ESA cup noodle needs to run the E3 show. It would be
6640560	6645040	insane. Like I would just love it. We are at the point where cup noodle is a better run company
6645040	6652800	than the ESA. Yes. A hundred percent co-signed. Oh my God. All right. Uh, let's travel around
6652800	6657040	the world and check out some release dates and some things you can pick up with your, uh, cup
6657040	6663200	noodle, uh, gamer variety. Let's start in the U S uh, Loki. Uh, lots of stuff. We're in fourth,
6663200	6668080	we're not really in fourth quarter yet, but maybe it's basically fourth quarter at this point.

6807040	6812320	with the Castlevania DLC that is out in Japan this week in a regular and collector's edition.
6812320	6816080	Uh, I know we joke about a lot of collector edition stuff coming out of Japan, but the,
6816080	6822320	um, yeah, it looks like it comes with like, uh, uh, fake CD kind of thing. Uh, also just
6822320	6828480	a lot of artwork, a sticker book, like all this cute little thing. So, uh, like the, um, the, uh,

6927520	6932960	uh, PlayStation, we have VR skater and for PlayStation and switch, we have the many pieces
6932960	6941360	of Mr. Koo. All right. That's it. We have a few more stories for you all, and then we will get to
6941360	6946640	the listener round table. I don't know if we have emails tonight. I forgot to look, find out. Nope.
6946640	6950880	All right. But maybe we'll get a call or two and, uh, some questions from chat as well. And
6950880	6956080	just a little bit, we still have some stories starting with Loki. Yep. So we talked a little
6956080	6961680	bit about this, I think a few weeks ago about X-Box new reporting system that they're going to
6961680	6967840	have. Uh, now they have actually launched it. Um, initially in the U S UK, Canada, Ireland,
6967840	6974480	Australia, and New Zealand, it's going to be for reporting abusive voice chats and it allows you to
6975360	6980160	the system is going to capture 60 second clips and save it to your console. And you have 24
6980160	6986160	hours to complete your report. And then you can send off the offending clips to Microsoft's and
6987040	6991360	ban somebody, or at least give them seven warnings. I think they had originally,
6993280	6998080	seven strike plan. Yeah. That's some game of baseball there. Um, our feature is designed
6998080	7003760	so that only, only you, the player can initiate the capture of the last 60 seconds of gameplay.
7004560	7010720	Activity occurred for the content moderation purposes that says it works. Um, let's see,
7010720	7015520	they will not appear in your recent captures and the clips cannot be downloaded and modified
7016480	7026160	or shared. Um, okay, cool. I mean, well, I mean, if it's abusive content, then you shouldn't share
7026160	7031760	it. Right. Right. I would assume, you know, um, so I guess you got to really be on the ball though,
7031760	7036960	if it's, you know, only 60 seconds previously. So it makes, it doesn't make sense.
7037520	7041120	I do feel like there's been a lot more companies that have been taking this sort of abuse that
7041120	7044960	happens on platforms a little more seriously. Like I've been seeing just, you know, cause I've
7044960	7050160	been playing a little more Overwatch lately and I, uh, have seen people that are using the reporting
7050160	7054720	features in there and you actually get the actual reports that say something happened, which is nice.
7054720	7058800	I wish other games I've played in the past would do something like that. Um, that, that let them
7058800	7063360	know that their reports didn't go to waste. So, um, it's just interesting to see, you know,
7063360	7067360	especially considering, you know, that, that example is jumping out at me and I'm thinking
7067360	7071200	about who Microsoft is trying to buy right now, that they are trying to clean up, you know,
7071200	7078480	a lot of the stuff shenanigans that happen on Xbox live. So yeah. Um, let's just, let's just
7078480	7083920	hope it leads to cleaning up some of these things that we assume to be true about Xbox live, uh,
7083920	7090400	and a place where everyone feels welcome, which is very important. So, uh, dark soccer.
7091920	7098480	Um, for the game sea of stars, their developer sabotage is working on some DLC.
7099200	7106000	So of course this is a retro RPG. It's a pretty well liked from what I understand. Um,
7106000	7114880	but on Canada radio, their CEO theory Bollinger, I guess, uh, was, uh, basically, uh, saying that
7114880	7119760	there's going to be some, some new stuff. And there was also a blog post at the time that said
7119760	7126080	a fully fledged site adventure DLC would be called throws of the watchmaker and would expand even
7126080	7133120	more on the world of sea of stars. And there you go. I definitely like that's one of those games
7133120	7136080	that just came out in this last week where it's like, Oh my God, I got to get around to that too.
7136080	7141200	Yeah. I've heard a lot of good things about it. Just, you know, the, that it really feels like
7141200	7145840	some type of spiritual successor to chrono trigger. Um, and I don't know why there's
7145840	7150880	this rumor out there that I hate chrono trigger. I don't, um, I I'm very excited to check out this
7150880	7155840	game and, and, uh, uh, check it out. It looks really cool. I've, I've saw a little bit of
7155840	7161680	streaming of it, but not at times. I didn't want to spoil it for myself. So. All right.
7161680	7170320	Loki. Uh, yes. So that wonderful game stray about the cat wandering through a cyberpunk
7170320	7177520	dystopia is, um, apparently going to be getting a movie, an animated movie. Um,
7178720	7184720	and they said, you know, it's, um, they called the game the greatest hope punk movie that's
7184720	7190320	ever been made. Um, I'm excited about it. I'm gonna think of you a good property to make an
7190320	7197120	animated movie for. So we'll see what ends up happening with that when it's coming. Um,
7199440	7208400	neat. Yeah. Um, I, uh, obviously we are seeing a lot of games get adapted into movies and TV
7208400	7213760	and all that sort. So I can't say it's too surprising, but it's kind of cool. Cause that's
7213760	7219120	stray. I don't want to say it came out of nowhere, but like, I, you know, they announced it and
7219120	7223280	everybody was like, Ooh, the cat game. And everybody then kind of like jumped on board
7223280	7228640	with it. And it did, it did very well as a result. So, um, because it delivered on being the cat
7228640	7233040	game. Uh, and I think people really had fun with it. So it's kind of, and I didn't realize that,
7233040	7238880	uh, Anna Purna is actually, they have an animation studio and a Purna animation that they made a
7238880	7245520	Nomura or Nimona on Netflix. So they've already done an animated movie. So now they get to use
7245520	7251200	their own property for that. Yeah. Uh, Tiger con chat says the title might cause confusion
7251200	7256720	because there was a movie called strays, a dog movie that's rated R and we get movies that come
7256720	7260800	out with the same title. Sometimes like, you know, after a few years go by and I don't think this is
7260800	7264640	something that's going to be coming out this year. It's going to be a few years off. Put the cute cat
7264640	7274480	on the poster or the, the little, um, box art. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and crystal skies points out,
7274480	7282000	they finished Nimona. Uh, they didn't fully make it. Oh, got it. Okay. Okay. All right. Um,
7282000	7288160	I think we got one more here and, uh, this is a little bit surprising. Uh, this kind of came out
7288160	7294320	of nowhere, but I'm, I'm having a flappy bird kind of moment hearing about this and it's not exactly,
7294320	7299920	but yeah. Okay. Well, let's talk about it. So it is the viral game only up, which you may have seen
7299920	7304240	played on Twitch. Cause a lot of people have been playing it on Twitch. Uh, it's no longer available
7304240	7310080	on steam. It was delisted from steam. Uh, this game has had a lot of interesting chat around it
7310080	7315520	because there's been talk about infringing assets. Cause somebody there's that the fact that the game
7315520	7321200	promoted NFTs, which we all know of pretty much flopped in the industry at this point, uh, gamers
7321200	7326400	won on that one. We pushed back against that boy. Oh boy. I think finally enough companies heard us
7326400	7331600	that NFTs, you don't hear anybody talking about it in games anymore. Well, except in like very
7331600	7337280	obscure places where they belong. Um, but now the creator of the game says they need to put the
7337280	7342800	game behind them due to stress. What I need now is peace of mind and healing says the developer
7342800	7349920	S C K R games. There was an update on the steam page, uh, about the decision saying I'm a solo
7349920	7354960	developer and this game is my first experience in game dev, a game I did for creativity to test
7354960	7359680	myself and where I made a lot of mistakes. The game has kept me under a lot of stress all these
7359680	7364160	months. Now I want to put the game behind me and yes, the game won't be available in the steam
7364160	7369520	store soon. That's what I decided myself. And sure enough, it is no longer available.
7370240	7377200	Don't make an NFT game. Well, I don't necessarily think the NFT part was that big. It was,
7377200	7379840	they weren't like, it wasn't, that wasn't front and center. I want to say like,
7379840	7384720	it's not in the game. I want to say maybe the developer at one point like talked about it
7384720	7388400	possibly. Like it's one of those things that I think the headline got bigger than it actually
7388400	7394000	was like weren't in the game. Yeah. I don't know if it was a lot of the infringing assets.
7394000	7400960	I know that was some contention before legit. Yeah. Because yeah, I'm wondering if it's more
7400960	7408480	of like legal, um, you know, pressure, you know, to like, okay, let's put this, let's, let's,
7408480	7413040	let's take this away. So no one else can find more assets or infringe type of thing because
7413040	7418240	I'm just a solo dev. And if I get sued, I'm gonna be in trouble. Cause I don't have a lot
7418240	7423920	of money. Uh, so Bobby points out that there was NFT iconography in the game. So maybe there were,
7424960	7430800	the dev was probably a fan of this and, uh, probably inserted some of that into the game,
7430800	7439360	but did the game itself use NFTs? It does not appear so. So, um, but all that aside,
7439360	7444720	it was very popular on Twitch and it's not often you hear about popular games where the developer
7444720	7449760	just says, I'm out and just up and leaves. And that's, that's kind of why I pulled in the
7449760	7453520	reference to flappy bird, which I know is a bit of a different circumstance, but that's another
7453520	7458480	one where I think right at the height of that game's fame, the guy said, I, I don't want to
7458480	7467120	do this anymore. Bye. And that was, that was it. And by golly, he stuck to his word. Right. So I,
7467120	7472640	it's interesting to see this happen. Um, that's, you know, basically leaving that money on the
7472640	7477360	table, but at the same time, I get it. It's a lot of stress when you're this one person,
7477360	7482640	your game is under a microscope and people are talking about NFT references or, you know,
7482640	7486240	the, the status of where certain assets came from and so forth.
7486240	7490400	Or just updating your game. Like you just don't want to do it anymore. Like I don't want to
7490400	7496160	support this game anymore. So like, I can't sit here and say, I blame him, but it's like,
7496160	7499440	you know, you got to put your mental health above everything else, period. I'm always going to
7499440	7506000	support that, but it is just still so you don't often see people walk away from this level of a
7506000	7511360	game with the exposure that it had for that. And that's just kind of what makes this like
7511360	7517440	surprising. But I, I don't wish the developer any ill will for sure. I hope he finds the piece he's
7517440	7523200	looking for, um, with this decision. Cause that is, that is a lot of money to leave behind. Um,
7523200	7531120	so good luck to him. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's go to our round table where we will solicit any
7531120	7536320	other questions y'all might have for us in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network
7536320	7541440	against which TV vog network. Um, you could also, if you want to head on over to our discord,
7541440	7545520	you can hop in the green room and we'll take some calls. Um, I believe dark Sakura already
7545520	7550080	mentioned we have no emails tonight, but if you'd like to send us an email for a future week,
7550080	7556720	participate at orange laundry.com is a great place to do it. Um, I will admit I did not check
7556720	7561440	our Twitter this week to see if we got anything, but I will take a look at that real quick,
7561440	7568000	just because I've been on that website less and less, but, um, I will still take a look.
7568000	7573200	I see dark soccer's plug for the show. Oh, I guess I could, I did tag OLR in this,
7573200	7578480	but since it's somewhat related, um, uh, talking a little bit about star field real quick.
7578480	7582560	One of the things I did like in star field was that they have some really cute little Easter
7582560	7588160	eggs and some of the art it's very tangential to, um, fall out. And some of the interesting
7588160	7592800	things you see there, but like I was rating a random moon base and I saw this poster
7592800	7596880	rely on each other and it looked like all the people holding hands, like, you know,
7596880	7601280	at the end of up, um, spoiler alert, that's big vibes. I got, I also, this was my favorite,
7601280	7607440	a vending machine that says we are so sorry for any inconvenience. We are currently out of ice,
7607440	7612080	but the gag is it's so old the, and it's abandoned on the moon. It's been iced over,
7612080	7617440	but I just, I don't know. I, I love those cute little like Easter eggs that are in the
7617440	7620480	environment. Dark soccer. I feel like this is something you can appreciate too. When you used
7620480	7625120	to do things like the mass effecting blog where, you know, you would go around and find all these
7625120	7629920	things in the environment, like store names on the Citadel and things like that. Yeah. Yeah.
7629920	7634400	This one's intimate lingerie. Like that stuff like that is really funny to me.
7634400	7637040	I have a last minute story. If you'd want to. Oh, sure. Let's do it.
7637840	7646960	So this comes from, um, a, I don't know. It's, I guess it's from a website, the boy from Mexico.
7646960	7653360	It's this guy, uh, talking Edward Dennis, uh, who's talking about his book, but in the, about
7654160	7660800	this Edward Dennis guy, it says artist, author, animator, game designer. And one of the blurbs
7660800	7669040	in here says, um, uh, in addition to this, Edward is working with paramount pictures on a video
7669040	7676800	adaptation of their twin peaks property. Now, obviously not a video adaptation. I think the
7676800	7684720	referencing video game is just mistyped in here, but could there be a twin peaks game coming
7685680	7691840	from paramount? Could that have just been placeholder text or something? I don't know.
7691840	7698160	I'm a little, this, this is a reach to me. Um, I mean, I would love to see some type of official
7698160	7703600	twin peaks game. Here's the thing. I don't see it as something David Lynch would get into.
7704640	7709600	That's, that's where my, that's the real block from my mind. Like, I, I don't want to,
7709600	7714320	you know, just because this is just a random thing, I'm a person I've never heard of. I don't
7714320	7718880	want to necessarily dismiss it on that alone, but just the concept. I feel like David Lynch
7718880	7724960	would hate it. So I, unless somebody has talked him into it, which great. I don't see this as
7724960	7731600	something David Lynch would ever embrace. I just don't. And I mean, granted, I feel like he has
7731600	7736560	ultimate control over the IP because that's why it took so long for there to be a reboot. I suppose
7736560	7742160	if paramount own that or Showtime or whatever, now, maybe they could go around them. But I,
7742240	7750480	I just know if he's not involved, it's going to suck. And that's just the fact. So yeah.
7751120	7755120	Yeah. Bobby Blackwell says that might be, I had a phone call with them once and that's,
7755760	7759760	that's a little bit, that's kind of the vibes I get from that. You know, again, if,
7759760	7765520	if somebody has convinced David Lynch to make a video game, then fuck yeah, I'm here for it.
7765520	7770320	And honestly, it might be a great way to continue the story of twin peaks because the reality is
7770320	7776160	a lot of key actors and actresses in twin peaks are dying. They're passing away. The log lady is
7776160	7783760	no longer with us. Um, the, one of the prominent, um, FBI folks is no longer with us. David Bowie
7783760	7790720	passed away. They kind of found a way around that in the, the, the return, but like video games would
7790720	7797680	be a way for the universe of twin peaks to, to live on without having to rely on, you know,
7797680	7803680	if certain people are going to be physically able or present to do a twin peaks continuation.
7803680	7809840	So like if somebody has been able to convince David Lynch of that, then fucking awesome. But
7809840	7815520	I just, as a big fan of twin peaks, my big reaction is, Oh, David Lynch would never go
7815520	7820480	for that. Forget it. Like he'll have to die and it'll be his estate. And that's going to be many
7820480	7827280	years. So, um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Babylon five continued last month with an
7827280	7832080	animated movie and that's how they cast new voices for the actors who passed. Yeah. It's very,
7832080	7836880	very similar to that concept. So. Wouldn't be too unlike what happened with, uh,
7837680	7845520	the doctor who, uh, second doctor episodes. Yeah. Yeah. They had to remake them in animation,
7845520	7851920	but yeah. Uh, Shane in chat says I need more twin peaks media. Anyway, I can get it. I'll take a
7851920	7858560	game. That PSX demo looked very good. It did look good, but it didn't really look, I don't,
7858560	7863200	I don't know how fun of a game it is. I feel like the entire, and I don't want to disrespect the
7863200	7868560	folks that worked hard on that because again, as a fan, I think that's a really great fan project,
7868560	7873040	but I think that's all it's going to be is a, Oh, that's neat. Oh, look what they did there. Oh,
7873040	7879840	that's a cool reference. Oh, I love that. It's not going to really build on the universe. If
7879840	7886960	we're talking a legit twin peaks video game, I'm expecting that it is continuing the universe and
7886960	7892400	the, you know, essentially mythology at this point behind twin peaks and continuing those stories.
7894160	7899200	I would love to have the ending of the return explained. This is the wild thing about twin
7899200	7905760	peaks, the return. If you watch all, but the, the next to last episode, you're like, wow,
7906400	7911840	they really brought this full circle. This is incredible. They, I mean, they do it kind of fast,
7911840	7917280	but like the way they tie it back to the very beginning is like, Holy shit, this is incredible.
7917280	7922000	It's like, he really did know this was it the whole time. And like, it took us, you know,
7922000	7927040	25 years to get here, but here we are, it was mind blowing. And then you get one more episode,
7927040	7936320	the very last episode. And you're like, the fuck was that? What now? What happened? What?
7937200	7943440	And like the way it ends, you know, very much like the original Twin Peaks series itself. How's Annie?
7943440	7950400	Like the way this ends is just like, that is too much of a cliffhanger. And yeah,
7950400	7955200	Shane said, that's why I need more. Yeah, same. I would love nothing more than another
7955200	7960000	Twin Peaks season four. But the more and more time that passes, the less and less
7960000	7967520	likely it is that it's going to happen unless they, they really do change the year and have
7967520	7970720	a completely different cast in there or something. I don't know. I don't know how they do it.
7971760	7977520	So we'll see. Anyway. Any other last minute stories, Loki?
7979600	7980160	Nope.
7980160	7984240	All right. Well, with that, then I think we're towards the end of another episode and we will
7984240	7990000	start to wrap things up. We'll say goodbye first to Dark Sacras. I believe you're going
7990000	7994800	to do your thing. But do you have any final thoughts or party words for us tonight?
7997440	7998720	I have a request.
7998720	7999520	Yeah.
7999520	8005920	If anyone is in a thrift store and they see one of the Echo Kitchama jigs, they're like
8005920	8011040	these slotted spoon things. Buy it for me, please. I will pay for shipping. I've been looking for one.
8011040	8014160	Interesting. Is that a slotted spoon?
8014160	8019760	They're super convenient. It's like a kind of a slotted spoon spatula sort of thing. And it's
8019760	8023600	like this Holy grail of kitchen equipment. Cause you can fry with it and do all this stuff. And
8023600	8026160	I super want one. Cause we used to have one when I was a kid.
8027040	8027760	Interesting.
8027760	8031920	They're like a very neat spoon. If anyone wants to know what it is, just look it up.
8032560	8035840	All right. We'll have fun with your Dead by Daylighting tonight. We'll see you in a little
8035840	8036160	bit.
8036160	8040880	Okay. I know that was a random one, but that's the truth. All right. I'll see y'all later.
8041040	8047120	All right. Take care. Bye-bye. All right. And Loki lap last but not least your final thought.
8047120	8050400	Oh, wait, no, wait. Sorry. Before we get to your final thought, let me say,
8050400	8053360	thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and downloading our show,
8053360	8056480	whether you were here live or you were listening to us in the podcast feed.

8064640	8068640	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show like Spotify,
8068640	8072720	whatever. That goes an awful long way as well. We really appreciate all of that.
8072720	8077440	Also, we would really appreciate a follow for VOG Network over not just on Twitch,
8077440	8083440	but on YouTube as well, as well as our social medias, both Blue Sky and Twitter.
8085680	8087600	Loki, now I'll go to your final thought.
8088640	8096480	My final thought is tomorrow at noon, New Pacific and 3 p.m. Eastern will be when I debut my
8096480	8101920	finale for season two. So look for that. Be on the YouTube feed. It has a premiere
8102560	8109200	probably later tonight and it will be up on social media later tonight as well.
8110720	8115760	If I remember and I don't have a meeting that bleeds into noon, which sometimes happens,
8115760	8120880	I will I will lurk in the channel. That's fine. Or just watch it whenever.
8120880	8125840	Yeah, absolutely. I'll get you get to those views. All right. Awesome.
8126480	8130160	Let's see my final thought tonight. Thanks again to Dragon Con for a great time.
8130720	8136160	Looking forward to TwitchCon in a few weeks. And I guess I'm starting Baldur's Gate 3 tonight.
8136160	8140720	So I'm going to be doing some playing on my own channel tomorrow with Baldur's Gate 3 after work.
8140720	8147120	So check that out. That adventure is beginning very soon. Rob Roberts here on Twitch. So that's
8147120	8152640	going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you all so much for watching
8152640	8157280	the show tonight. Appreciate it. Have a good one, everybody. And we'll see you next time. Bye.
8182640	8186080	Radio, nor fog network, but you know, they were all.
