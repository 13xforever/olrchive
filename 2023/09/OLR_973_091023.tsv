20107	21207	It's caffeinated.
21207	23028	Need a pick you up that won't thick you up?
23028	24329	Gaming Cup Noodle.
24329	25329	It's caffeinated.
25329	27671	Real talk would slurp eerily.
27671	29351	This is the RGB packaged intro.
29351	34594	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this and the rest of the two weeks in gaming news.
34594	36775	Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
39042	56527	hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is orange lounge radio and we are live once again as jason said there in the intro um after uh missing last week we'll talk about that
56927	70651	for tonight September the 10th of 2023 episode number 973 and now live and on the air and with me tonight joining me as always say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70651	72031	Hello.
72031	72371	Hello.
72371	73692	Hello.
73692	74052	How are you?
74052	74612	How did you?
74612	75292	How was your week off?
77561	79843	Uh, what week off?
79843	80463	I guess.
80463	82264	Well, I did a 13 hour stream.
82264	82725	That's true.
82725	83225	That's true.
83225	86648	So you were, you were working, but different type of work.
86648	87989	But I didn't advertise enough.
87989	93573	So like only a few people were there, but I appreciate the people who were, and I made a bunch of friends during my subathon.
93573	103380	And honestly, it's just the, like the, the last few series of weeks have just been, um, uh, compostable.
104045	119610	It's probably was a tricky week weekend to do a subathon to with all the the just stuff that goes on for Labor Day, you know, between your Dragon Con where I was at Penny Arcade Expo, I know here locally SacAnime, like it's just it's a big convention weekend, and the other types of holiday junk that people do.
120565	124128	None of that had anything to do with what was going on with my week though.
124128	125969	I'm just saying the Summathon attendance.
125969	126609	Yeah.
126609	129852	So yeah, I mean, but but I honestly, I didn't advertise it enough.
129852	131113	And that's really what it was.
131113	139379	And I mean, given that I have people from all over the world, you know, who don't necessarily celebrate the same holiday or have to deal with our conventions.
139379	142501	So it was it was just all my fault.
142501	144442	Well, you got to play video games all day, though.
144442	145343	So hopefully that was still fun.
146984	149225	All day solo queue.
149225	149705	Wow.
149705	150905	Except for a little bit.
150905	153486	I played with a few people.
153486	153806	All right.
153806	157327	Well, also joining us tonight, even though he's not on video yet, he is with us.
157327	159167	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
159167	160767	Happy early birthday.
160767	162708	I've been here the whole time.
162708	163348	That's right.
163348	164528	You said what's going on?
164528	166529	You're not on video right now, but you will be later.
166529	168269	You're like rendering a video or something.
168269	172650	I am rendering a video that I've been working editing for literally a month.
172650	173310	Oh, yeah.
173310	174591	I've seen your posts about this.
174591	175611	You've been working very hard on this.
176802	181384	Yes, it's been a whole month that I've been editing this video.
181384	183405	And now it is.
183405	184805	It is done.
184805	187226	Well, it's so done.
187226	189467	Well, as DarkSakura beat me to it.
189467	191007	Happy early birthday.
191007	191427	Thank you.
191427	193708	Because I know your birthday is tomorrow.
193708	194169	It is.
194169	197370	It's a day that a lot of people remember your birthday.
197370	202252	And I... We both have a disaster birthday, you know.
202252	203372	Mine was the Waco thing.
204910	211714	Whereas my birthday is the day that sodomy laws got overturned and is also the gay marriage legalization day.
211714	214655	So I have a bit of a celebration day, I guess.
214655	217037	Although I will say I also share a birthday with Tim Curry.
217037	217637	So there's that.
217637	219558	Oh, that is that is pretty good.
219558	224021	My my big birthday share is Ariana Grande.
224021	225842	So who's your big birthday share, Loki?
231169	235293	Maybe we should talk about the big event he shares his birthday with.
235293	236074	No, no, no.
236074	240378	Like, OK, well, I'm going to try not to, like, put this in Debbie Downer mode here.
240378	245103	But no, like so it was a bit of ironic trivia.
245103	250008	So I saw the other day, like on on Facebook, it was reminded to me that
250928	255492	Steve Irwin passed on September 4th, which happens to be the day that my mom passed as well.
255492	256872	I was like, oh, that's interesting.
256872	258594	They passed on the same day.
258594	262116	But I know that's not positive at all.
262116	262917	Moby?
262917	263557	I mean, that's cool.
263557	264738	And Keanu Reeves.
264738	266479	Oh, that's doubly cool.
266479	268020	There's your answer.
268020	268520	There we go.
268520	269081	I'll take that.
269081	272523	And apparently Ludacris and John Ritter.
272523	273384	Oh, wow.
273384	277547	That's one heck of an action movie right there.
277547	278647	Yeah.
278647	279388	And Harry Connick Jr.
281148	281989	I love it.
281989	285815	Hey, there's some folks.
285815	289801	Well, Loki, I'm glad you're getting you're getting a YouTube finish for your birthday.
289801	290622	That's really exciting.
291069	291570	I am.
291570	293411	I'm going to be premiering it tomorrow.
293411	297815	It is my season two finale of Channel 64.
297815	304261	Yes, the season three technically started like two or three weeks ago, but it took a while.
304261	308344	It is essentially like a mini movie.
308344	312068	It is almost 35 minutes long with credits.
314871	326433	It's it is the culmination of all of the lore and SMPs that I've been on since the beginning of making Minecraft content.
326433	329394	And it is.
329394	339776	There's a lot of like deeply emotional things that are going on with it, I guess, like, I don't know, like it sounds really like like depressing, but like it's it's
340881	350328	Basically, there's a lot of themes that go along with it, and especially if you've watched my older content, then you would catch a lot of the stuff that's in this one.
350328	353831	There's a lot of, like, kind of ties back to everything.
353831	366421	It's not only celebrating the lore that I've created in, like, my stuff, but the lore that's been created in Channel 64, lore that's been created in other SMPs that get brought up in this.
366421	367641	It has been...
368766	384977	The most painful thing I've had to edit because like like put it this way so like a normal like Minecraft video that I put together and stuff like has you know it's like it's like say uh okay well a lot of these more recent ones okay so say like you know maybe
387127	388828	20 video files.
388828	394309	You know, audio wise, there's like maybe 10 audio clips or something like that.
394309	394709	This one has 344.
394709	398410	There's 180.
398410	405591	Last I count, there was 180, 190 replay mod shots that I had to create and edit.
405591	410272	But that was probably two thirds of the way through the whole process.
410272	412573	So I don't even know what the new count is, but it's a lot.
414702	417925	So it was a lot of stuff and a lot of special effects things.
417925	424631	I had to do a lot of AI voices, a lot of voice lines by our voice actors as well.
424631	427113	Just a lot of everything.
427113	434399	But it's action-packed, it's got emotional beats in there, it's just got everything.
435297	436398	That is my pitch.
436398	440202	You absolutely need to use your birthday to guilt people into watching it.
440202	441123	That's what I said earlier.
441123	445187	I said I'm going to use those guilt points to get people to watch the video.
445187	445588	Do it.
445588	447850	No, but it really is a good time.
447850	452014	I poured everything into this, so I hope people enjoy it.
452314	452934	All right.
452934	460918	Well, we will look for that on the socials tomorrow, including the VOG Network Discord, where I know you'll post that over at VOGNetwork.com slash Discord.
460918	462939	Again, that's VOGNetwork.com slash Discord.
462939	465180	A great place to chat with us throughout the week.
465180	478287	Speaking of birthdays, it is so tomorrow is your birthday, but I noticed in chat a reminder that today is PodCulture's birthday, which is funny because I actually got to see him at Dragon Con.
478667	480388	where I was at last week.
480388	482750	So happy birthday, Brad, from PodCulture.
482750	485832	And it was great to see you in person last week.
485832	493456	So I hope you are having the best I know you brought back a nasty souvenir from DragonCon, but I hope you are having the best birthday possible in light of all that.
493456	493596	And
494637	496999	Yeah, I hope everything's going great for you.
496999	505246	And DragonCon, quickly, I will say, you know, I'm not going to go too much into depth in DragonCon, because I've talked a lot about it on this show.
505246	509910	And I want to nudge you over to our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.
509910	516656	Bobby and I not only did a DragonCon preview show before, but we did a DragonCon wrap up show earlier this week.
516656	520899	So if you want to hear all about some of the details and some of our suggestions to make 2024 even better,
521940	531428	I'm going to point you in that direction but I will just quickly say once again a big thank you to the video game track as well as the digital media track for having me back and taking part in some panels.
531428	549222	I got to moderate for the video game track a really cool panel on diversity in video games and the only bummer was that some of our speakers kind of had to back out at the last minute for whatever reason you know whether you know it's sickness or whatever conflict whatever so we only had it was me and two panelists
549722	550363	I remember you!
565045	565666	Thank you for watching!
584530	589473	Not every panel at DragonCon is streamed, because they kind of want you to go to DragonCon.
589473	591774	So that one is not streamed.
591774	594475	So you'll just have to come next year to see a similar panel, hopefully.
594475	602199	But the digital media track panels, because the content is about digital media, it does make sense that that is then archived on digital media.
602199	606682	So I will point you over to the YouTube channel for digital media,
607782	609083	DcDigitalMedia
630255	649327	and or VoB Kurt as I joke because it's actually VO or voiceover by Kurt but some people say it VoB Kurt and I think it sounds cute but that panel is it was thriving on streaming media when you're over 40 years old which to be honest a lot of people go how's that different from thriving when you're 20 and 30 excellent question
649627	650689	We answer it in the panel.
650689	653794	So go check it out over on YouTube.
653794	654755	Shout out for that panel.
654755	657139	So yes.
657139	660724	Okay, that's that's my plug for DragonCon related content.
660724	663629	And thanks again for having me and I am already planning for 2024.
665320	666581	as is Alan.
666581	669364	Alan had remember this was Alan's first dragon con.
669364	677150	And he saw enough in the con even though he was a little overwhelmed by I think just all the people and all the things there was to do it can it can absolutely be sensory overload.
677150	682374	I think sometimes he's like, I see the potential and things I want to do next year.
682374	683615	So he's gonna come back.
683615	684016	That'd be great.
685126	688429	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
688429	698660	We missed quite a few things this last week, especially because at the same time Dragon Con is going on, and the Arcade Expo is going on as well as some other conventions around the country.
698660	703424	So we have a few headlines that came out from over the long weekend last weekend.
703424	706387	Loki, I don't know if you want to jump into some of these or you want me to take?
706387	706728	Okay, cool.
707828	726994	I don't know too much about the Final Fantasy 16 stuff because I haven't been paying attention to it, but I do remember though they did make the announcement that they are going to be doing a PC version that is in development and that there is also going to be some 2A DLCs that are going to be added as well and then they have an update that they've added to the game.
728315	735244	The PC version I'm excited about because then I actually get to play it because I am not buying a console for a game, so sorry.
735244	739030	And people are going to mod the hell out of it, so that's going to be interesting too.
739030	740672	I mean, yeah, like, yeah.
741803	743845	That's how it goes.
743845	748848	How many days until a nude Sid and a nude Clive mod?
748848	751089	Less than zero.
751089	757293	The question is though, do we get nude mod before we get CJ mod from San Andreas?
757293	759114	Like, which one comes first?
759114	760254	That's the better question now.
760254	760975	Like, nude mod
761660	762981	Yeah, guaranteed.
762981	764623	CJ mod, yep, guaranteed.
764623	765784	But which one comes first?
765784	767245	That's a good question.
767245	768026	That's the new meta.
768026	770107	We gotta start betting on that stuff.
770107	771849	That's right.
771849	781918	But yeah, so they added an update which gave you a weapon skin feature and also the onion sword weapon and new outfits.
782940	785581	and then of course the two paid DLC.
785581	788761	I don't know if they go into detail what those are going to be about necessarily.
788761	794443	They did not talk about specifics, at least as far as I caught, about what they will be about.
794443	806626	There's a lot of speculation that because Leviathan was missing from the lineup of icons, I keep wanting to say primals, because they are on 14,
807206	807346	and
825183	832425	Fast forward between the prologue and then what you see later in the game, or even before the prologue.
832425	838107	So there's talks about that maybe the DLC will actually be a little more standalone, which could be interesting.
838107	842808	But yeah, I'm okay with there being DLC.
842808	854311	I would rather see a 16.2 eventually that could fix some of the issues that 16 had, not just technically, but with lack of representation and things like that would be a great thing to add into the world.
854851	859352	Oh, that's why the PC version, you know, we can fix some of that.
859352	861013	Maybe the DLC will address some of that.
861013	863853	Maybe we'll go to another continent and we'll see a little more diversity.
863853	864274	I don't know.
864274	867614	I think it's really early to say, but we'll see.
867614	869035	We'll see where it takes us.
869035	878577	I'm glad that in light of the stories we saw a couple of weeks ago where people were like, Final Fantasy 16 only sold three million copies or whatever it was.
878577	879737	I don't even remember how many copies it was.
879737	881598	Oh, God, Tomb Raider all over again.
881958	882678	Yeah, and all that stuff.
882678	887859	Like, I'm glad to hear it is doing well enough where they are talking about DLC.
887859	891800	And I mean, the PC version, come on, we all knew it was, we all knew it was coming.
891800	897561	And it was just some, some dumb arrangement that was keeping their lips sealed on that.
897561	898582	But we all knew that was coming.
898582	900262	Never do that.
900262	902402	That's what the that's what the competition does.
902402	903383	And that's bad.
903383	905283	We fight against that in the courts.
905283	905643	Do that.
905783	907023	We would never do that.
907023	907443	Right.
907443	908204	That's awful.
908204	908704	Yeah.
908704	913905	So it's it's nice to see that that is all confirmed and all that good stuff.
913905	915226	So.
915226	915586	Yeah.
915586	916826	Yeah.
916826	917126	Yeah.
917126	917966	So I'm excited for.
917966	924048	Oh, and the other thing I know this probably is not on your list, but I want to say it about Final Fantasy 16 at PAX.
924048	925448	I was a little jealous.
925448	929529	Usually I am not jealous about the decision to go to Dragon Con over PAX.
929529	931350	I've let my feelings be known on this show.
931350	932050	It is what it is.
932050	933771	However.
933771	934871	Ben Starr went to PAX.
935777	938459	and I was a little jealous about that.
938459	945985	And he wasn't the only one, several of the 16 voice actors all went to PAX because they did a panel where all this was basically announced.
945985	963519	So I was a little jealous about that and I'm hoping maybe DragonCon will get the 16 voice actors next year because I'll tell you, I would do just about anything, and I mean it, to moderate that panel with Ben Starr.
963519	964120	I'm just saying.
966719	968159	Just about.
968159	971380	Don't get crazy, but just about anything.
971380	973021	All right, that's all I have to say.
973021	975742	A little bit confused by Ben Starr.
975742	976402	You're a little bit confused?
976402	977682	I actually don't know who that is.
977682	979203	Oh, he's the he's the voice of Clive.
979203	987485	The Ben Starr that... Because the Ben Starr I know of was on MasterChef and was really cool.
989571	991372	Sexy Clive Voice Actor
1008356	1008796	What's his?
1008796	1009957	What's his?
1009957	1011498	He has a he has a Twitter account.
1011498	1017803	That's where he posts all these things with like, you know, pretending to do voices of Mario and things like that.
1017803	1019744	He does all these things.
1019744	1023467	And he's just, he's, it's not just his looks.
1023467	1024908	I mean, but the voice too.
1024908	1025928	It's those things together.
1025928	1029051	It's, it's very, yes, that's all I'm gonna say.
1029051	1030912	Anyway, next story, Loki.
1030912	1031472	All right.
1031472	1033114	So they did a Nintendo Direct.
1035603	1037733	Sorry, sorry, I'm having some lag.
1037733	1038255	I apologize.
1038255	1038738	No, you're fine.
1038738	1039140	No worries.
1039140	1039341	No worries.
1040763	1048068	So Nintendo did a Super Mario Wonder Direct and showed off a little bit more of the game and some of the different gameplay elements to it.
1048068	1058835	I actually watched this, it feels like ages ago at this point, but they showed off that this is the Flower Kingdom that you're in now, so not necessarily the Mushroom Kingdom.
1058835	1063858	And they have six distinct worlds that are in this game.
1063858	1065420	And what's kind of cool about that is there's
1066540	1071666	Some of the different levels that are in there you can actually tackle in any order that you want.
1071666	1085723	A little more disappointing though is the fact that all of the different characters that they have available, so like Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Toad, and Toadette all play the same.
1086582	1091403	which I feel is kind of like, you know, a missed opportunity.
1091403	1109569	However, they do have, as part of that kind of being more open to gamers that may not necessarily be as good, they have Yoshi and Nabbit that have different effects to them that allows the game to be played in a way that, you know,
1110189	1115131	is much easier, you know, with, of course, like the floaty jumps that Yoshi has.
1115131	1119913	And I think also just not really being able to see.
1119913	1121394	Yeah, Yoshi.
1121394	1123015	Let's see.
1123015	1124355	You can also ride Yoshi.
1124355	1125796	Someone else is playing them as well.
1125796	1127236	That's kind of cool.
1127236	1130338	They showed a bunch of new power ups, like the elephant fruit.
1131803	1134445	and you can blow bubbles and whatnot with that.
1134445	1135726	That's kind of cool.
1135726	1138088	Very pretty looking game altogether.
1138088	1157420	And then they also have this weird kind of multiplayer mode where you actually see other players running around in the game at the same time and you can even leave messages for them or like leave icons or it's almost like little cardboard cutouts that you leave in the game.
1157420	1158621	And then if you die,
1159877	1164200	If that bubble hits that thing, then you come back to life or something like that.
1164200	1164760	I don't know.
1164760	1166822	It's interesting.
1166822	1181972	And then they talked about, like, kind of the flowers that you can get that kind of twist everything around, and those are in-game as well, and it looks pretty trippy, so... It's touch fuzzy, get dizzy vibes all over again, but, you know... Different drugs this time.
1184204	1188066	But this is coming out in October on the 20th, so it looks pretty sweet.
1188066	1189706	I will say I am definitely picking it up.
1189706	1190327	It looks neat.
1190327	1192548	Yeah, it's one of those things like how can you not pick it up?
1192548	1194048	Like it looks really good.
1194048	1203872	But I do see where it's unfortunate that the characters don't have a little more of their personality like they did even as far back as Super Mario Brothers 2.
1203872	1210115	But I get maybe for game balancing and what I really think they're going for, you know, it's it's Nintendo's bread and butter.
1210115	1212256	It's multiplayer gaming on the couch.
1213036	1215837	with young kids, hence the nabbit and all that stuff.
1215837	1219438	Like that's very much what they want to go for with this game.
1219438	1225740	They want something that you unwrap under the proverbial Christmas tree or whatever it is you celebrate.
1225740	1228160	You unwrap it and you go right to playing it with the whole family.
1228160	1230741	That is very much the game they're going for.
1230741	1231061	Yeah.
1231061	1233982	And I think, honestly, these decisions are going to suit them fine.
1233982	1235703	The game's going to do very well.
1235703	1236043	Oh, yeah.
1236043	1236843	Yeah.
1236843	1237143	Yeah.
1237143	1238343	I mean, it's a Mario game.
1238343	1240264	It is not going to do not well.
1241879	1248988	And then they're also releasing a Special Edition Switch, well it's not even a Special Edition, I think it's the Red Switch that they had a while back with Odyssey.
1248988	1254295	They're releasing it again now with Wonder in there as well.
1254295	1256157	So, neat.
1256157	1259942	And then, last but not least, Volition has been shut down.
1260763	1276215	because the Embracer group, as part of their restructuring since they don't have that $2 billion of cash being pumped into their business, they have decided to shut down Volition.
1276215	1285362	Which, yeah, I guess that's sad that Volition is shutting down, but, I mean, is it the same Volition that made some of the earlier Saints Row games?
1285362	1286443	No.
1286443	1289425	Also, I kind of feel that, you know, being that
1290339	1296120	Volition was at a point where fans were giving them feedback on the game.
1296120	1299621	And I get it, fans can be terrible sometimes when it comes to games.
1299621	1304642	But if everybody's saying the same thing, like, this game looks like it's awful.
1304642	1311263	I don't like the idea of these main characters just being college kids that are trying to pay off student loans and then they turn to a life of crime.
1311263	1313424	That sounds really stupid and not gangsta.
1315107	1316447	You know, maybe take that feedback.
1316447	1321048	It would be like the equivalent of, say, for example, the Sonic movie.
1321048	1325189	If they release ugly Sonic in the trailers, everyone's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, this seems bad.
1325189	1327009	And they're like, no, it's good.
1327009	1328089	We're going to keep it like this.
1328089	1329970	It's better this way.
1329970	1331570	And then being surprised, what?
1331570	1334730	No one went to the box office to see our awful movie?
1334730	1336211	I'm shocked.
1336211	1338391	And that's kind of what we have here with Saints Row.
1338391	1343492	It was just, it was an awful game, premise-wise, and then awfully executed.
1343492	1343932	It was like,
1344827	1347968	the perfect storm of awfulness.
1347968	1350468	And not even in a fun way, like a Bethesda way.
1350468	1353829	Quest Buster in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1353829	1355089	I don't remember if I gave the plug.
1355089	1361210	We do tape live Sunday nights, of course, at 9 Eastern, 6 Pacific over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
1361210	1368852	And Quest Buster says, Volition News is sad, but after Agents of Mayhem in 2017, there were questions on what was going to happen with the studio.
1368852	1374033	And that's like, Loki, that's kind of got the vibe I got from your opinion, because at first I was like, oh, Loki's going to
1374333	1374774	And of course...
1389945	1411876	The core Saints Row games was Idle Ninja and unfortunately when he passed it was just any hope that we had left for the studio was just it died with him unfortunately and it's sad because you would hope that there are people that kind of want to bring that back and I get it like they were in a tough position like they had gone way too wacky with Saints Row it was just like off the rails crazy at that point
1412376	1413456	They could have dialed it back.
1413456	1417918	I mean, the whole fact that this is a reboot means you can dial it back to that earlier game.
1417918	1423380	Just, all you had to do was recreate the kind of sandbox-y environment that you had in the original game.
1423380	1430923	That sort of, you know, mentality used to add a solid story with the earlier games, and it had that grit on it.
1430923	1432364	This has no grit on it.
1432364	1435325	This is basically stupid characters that nobody likes,
1436105	1443229	And even worse, when you actually play through the game and you actually listen to your character, you hate them even more.
1443229	1445411	That is poor writing.
1445411	1448633	It's poor writing, poor execution, poor everything.
1448633	1460420	And even on top of all that, after all of that was done, they published the game, they still had the gall to put out DLC that was about LARPing.
1460420	1463802	I'm sorry, LARPing in a gangster, you know,
1464923	1467165	Sandbox Game, what the hell is that?
1467165	1471770	Like, it makes no sense whatsoever, and they just kept doubling and tripling down on this stuff.
1471770	1473833	So yeah, they had it coming.
1473833	1481781	I'm sorry, but like, if you keep making bad decisions over and over and over again, you're not gonna be operating anymore.
1481781	1486626	It sure was interesting how Saints Row showed up on PlayStation Plus, like,
1487643	1489924	a day after this announcement, you know what I mean?
1489924	1496586	Plus, wasn't this announcement tied with something like they really tried to sneak this announcement out there, like people would notice.
1496586	1500328	Like, I want to say it came out the same time as like.
1500328	1501748	Either it was on.
1501748	1506390	It released on Steam, too, like the game released on Steam shortly before this announcement.
1506390	1512552	I'm talking about the Volition news about the closure that they timed that very strange.
1512552	1513013	I don't know.
1514786	1520487	I mean, I feel bad for the people that worked for Volition, but at the same time, like.
1520487	1533809	Like, I'm sorry, some accountability needs to be had, like, like, yeah, it feels bad for any developer to close down and the people that are affected by that, like, because there are a lot of people that like that, they were just doing what they're told and like making the best thing they could do it.
1533809	1537110	But someone in the chain screwed that up big time.
1537110	1539190	And I think it was more than just like a few people.
1539190	1542211	It was a lot of people that really screwed the pooch on that one.
1542211	1542371	So.
1546668	1555517	Volition had some great titles in their history, Red Faction, The Free Space, Space Sims, and Descent, but as Loki pointed out, most of the people that came with those likely left.
1556233	1556933	Yeah, exactly.
1556933	1559255	And Red Faction, FreeSpace and a lot of stuff.
1559255	1565158	Like if they would put out more of those games, like I would have loved to see like, hey, I have an idea.
1565158	1568540	If you don't know what to do with Saints Row, then don't do anything with it.
1568540	1571442	Create a new Red Faction game and do that.
1571442	1572382	Like you could have taken that.
1572382	1581128	Well, I mean, it still may have been bad, but you could have at least taken Red Faction and like been able to stick with the space stuff and have an action game based off that.
1581128	1585130	And that would probably have been more successful than this was, but they just
1586638	1589239	I don't know what they were thinking with this, honestly.
1589239	1592041	Because like, after we saw the first trailer, it's like, ugh.
1592041	1597243	And then after we learned more about the characters, like, oh, no, no, no, no.
1597243	1599564	They just kept going with that.
1599564	1602065	They didn't know, like, oh, hey, we're listening to you.
1602065	1602865	We're taking your feedback.
1602865	1604646	It's like, nope.
1604646	1606167	Going straight up with what we're doing.
1607090	1613693	All right, well, I guess it's one of those things where it's it's it's a shock, but it's not a shock, right?
1613693	1616154	It's like, oh, my gosh, they really did close the studio.
1616154	1619095	And then you go, well, you look at what's happened in the last seven years.
1619095	1621176	It's not that surprising.
1621176	1625898	The caveat with this, though, is Volition's gone, but that doesn't mean the Saints Row license is dead.
1625898	1629500	You can give it to another studio and they can start from scratch.
1629500	1634442	And I want to say that I thought Gearbox was going to be doing something maybe with it, but like
1634882	1650981	Give it to somebody that, like Gearbox, like, whether you like Borderlands or, you know, some of that stuff, they have pretty good writers that understand context and understand humor and understand all that stuff, instead of just, like, making fart jokes all the time.
1650981	1652763	Like, that, it's just awful.
1652763	1654506	It's bad writing.
1654506	1654626	And...
1655937	1666089	I just think that those folks would have a better time with something like this because they can have fun with it, they know how to make a solid engine, they know how to make a solid game.
1666089	1667852	Like, let somebody competent take it.
1669887	1676811	Well, that about covers some of the big headlines we missed from our week off, but we still have to get to this week's headlines.
1676811	1677912	So we'll get to that shortly.
1677912	1684817	But first, we're going to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week or the last two weeks, I suppose.
1684817	1686017	So let's kick it off.
1686017	1687178	How was your gaming week?
1687178	1688239	We'll go to DarkSakura.
1688239	1690740	How was your gaming week?
1690740	1692922	It was all right.
1692922	1693002	Um,
1694136	1695517	What did I play?
1695517	1702562	I played Cult of the Lamb today to show it off to a friend.
1702562	1710127	I played, of course, I finished through all of the individual scenarios for Live Alive.
1710127	1715471	So I'm actually into like the main part of the end game.
1715471	1720475	And everything has just frozen on me all of a sudden.
1723951	1724772	Hello.
1724772	1725233	I'm here.
1725233	1725673	Sorry.
1725673	1727636	I noticed your avatar is frozen.
1728982	1730523	Yeah, I don't know what happened.
1730523	1734284	Just a bunch of stuff decided to freeze on me.
1734284	1742408	But at any rate, I've... Also, we got Godzilla pinball temporarily.
1742408	1746730	So we did a little momentary trade for that.
1746730	1752032	Also, we got Galactic Tank Force, which is amazing and cheeseball.
1752032	1756094	And the whole readout part of it is like watching a Sega CD game.
1756094	1756674	It's pretty...
1758689	1760611	Dead by Daylight and Disney Dreamlight Valley.
1760611	1763513	The Godzilla table is more fun than I thought it would be.
1777946	1781508	So, um, yeah, it's cool.
1781508	1787671	Um, and of course it ends in, uh, the, go Godzilla, you know, when you're done with your game.
1787671	1802259	Um, still playing Weird Al, um, and my, my stupid wordscape game that I'm, I'm feeling angry in a certain way about, cause it just, it takes money out of me and I don't want it to happen.
1802259	1803960	Other people, it's awesome.
1803960	1804400	I like it.
1804400	1805681	I liked, I liked the whole like,
1806853	1809074	vintage sci-fi stuff.
1809074	1811516	That looks awesome.
1811516	1814517	But no, it's super good.
1814517	1815118	I'm a fan.
1815118	1819680	Now, does the table that you guys have, do you have the tank treads on the side, or is it just the table?
1819680	1820461	We do not.
1820461	1827785	And actually, the thing is, is that it comes with like a big cannon that attaches to the back of the table, you know, on the back glass area.
1827785	1829686	And when you fold it down, it looks like the tank.
1830928	1839391	I don't know if that's my jam or not, but it's a pretty sweet setup.
1839391	1842993	And for the record, I'm relaunching all of my camera stuff.
1842993	1851576	But anyway, I really, really have just been all over both of these tables.
1851576	1852676	They're so much fun.
1858308	1864290	I played a little bit of, um... Oh, what was it?
1864290	1867572	It was, uh... I don't remember what it was I played.
1867572	1869652	It was something that I was trying out.
1869652	1876895	But I did buy Baldur's Gate 3, because the Mac version is going to officially be out.
1876895	1886419	Right now, the version that you can play is the last build for it, like, of the betas, before they released it, so...
1891292	1894194	I'm feeling pretty okay about it.
1894194	1899078	Okay, I think I see what's happening with my camera.
1899078	1911549	It's just, I mean, there's so much stuff for me to play at my house now that I don't even know, like, what else to play.
1911549	1913211	We've organized the game room now.
1914345	1920790	And, and I'm really hoping that, uh, we can actually get the whole classic game set up back again.
1920790	1931638	So, um, I'm looking forward to, to making the best out of that, but right now it's just been my usual and a lot of pinball.
1931638	1932879	All right.
1932879	1933980	Loki, how about you?
1933980	1936942	I know you've been working on a video, but anything else that you gave me week?
1936942	1937423	Nope.
1937423	1940145	I was editing the entire time, unfortunately.
1940570	1944612	So, I did play Minecraft, but in the sense that I was using it to edit.
1944612	1945053	Gotcha.
1945053	1948395	So, yeah, it was only that, unfortunately.
1948395	1948895	It's been busy.
1949340	1956662	Now I noticed through the social medias that like the net the Minecraft championship not rising is happening soon, right?
1956662	1972226	Because I've seen some of the programs we can because I've interacted with posts when you were doing it now like reading replies and stuff that now it pushes all that stuff to my for you page, which I try not to read but like always defaults to that I can't help but see some of it, you know, so I just I thought the other thought of you the other
1972586	1992260	Cannon event this weekend on the 16th at noon Pacific and then there's a special thing that they're doing in collaboration with Twitch rivals at TwitchCon that they're doing an in-person Minecraft MCC thing.
1993262	2000867	Although it's supposed to be different though, that's non-canon and I think it's with fewer players, so I'm not sure what they're doing with that, but that'll be interesting too.
2000867	2006290	I almost want to go to TwitchCon for that, but I can't because it's too soon.
2006290	2011413	I will get B-roll for you, or Jamie will, because it's in both our plans, so...
2013215	2014737	Yeah, maybe that might be something.
2014737	2017639	Yeah, I'm five weeks away TwitchCon.
2017639	2017920	I can't.
2017920	2022744	Yeah, that would be something to look forward to maybe next year or something like that.
2022744	2023485	Yeah, would be cool.
2025223	2026804	All right, well, my gaming week.
2026804	2031829	Um, so obviously, I was was busy with travel to Dragon Con and doing the convention.
2031829	2035311	But, you know, they had a nice arcade there at the convention.
2035311	2036553	So it was it was cool.
2036553	2042177	They kind of had two vendors that were merged together into one long arcade.
2042177	2045720	They had the joystick game bar, which was like classic games.
2045720	2048242	I'm trying to remember what I played in the classic arcade.
2048242	2049243	Oh, Mortal Kombat 2.
2049243	2050104	I remember playing that.
2051944	2069289	I was playing a little bit of that and the save point was the group that brought the import games.
2069289	2078952	They actually had a working Technica machine, which I hadn't seen in a while, so I could actually play Flea, which is my favorite song in Technica, and they also
2079452	2081034	had a Space Harrier machine.
2081034	2082016	So I thought of Jamie again.
2082016	2085300	I didn't take a picture this time because somebody was playing it when I walked by it.
2085300	2089726	But yeah, I saw that.
2089726	2093592	Wait, YYR, that was literally your machine I was playing?
2094934	2097374	That is funny or used to be, I guess.
2097374	2098135	That's funny.
2098135	2099095	Oh, wow.
2099095	2100075	What a small world.
2100075	2101515	OK, well, thanks, YYR.
2101515	2106456	So your arcade machine got to DragonCon before you did.
2106456	2108737	I want you to think about that for a minute.
2108737	2110797	I'm just messing.
2110797	2113017	But that's cool that I played that.
2113017	2115018	But yeah, they had a lot of other like dance games.
2115018	2118538	Obviously, the dance games were super popular and people were lining up for them.
2118538	2120979	And, you know, I've played plenty of dance games in my time.
2122419	2130322	I finally ponied up the money to get the Nintendo Expansion Pack for Nintendo Switch Online because I finally just wanted to play some of the Game Boy Advance games.
2130322	2140405	I played a lot of Mario Advance and Mario Advance 2, which is actually Super Mario 2 is the original Advance and the Super Mario World is Advance 2.
2140405	2142825	And I was playing a little bit of that.
2142825	2144846	So that was a lot of fun.
2144846	2145906	I played on that.
2145906	2147647	And then when I got back, boy, oh boy,
2148819	2150980	There's just been games coming out left and right.
2150980	2154000	So like DarkSakura, I have picked up Baldur's Gate 3.
2154000	2158041	I haven't played it yet, though, but that's coming this next week.
2158041	2164243	You all know the individual in my life that can talk me into buying a game so that we can play it together.
2164243	2166483	He's very good at convincing people to do things.
2166483	2168624	So please look forward to that.
2170406	2177416	And also, in addition to that, I picked up Starfield since that is, you know, of course on Game Pass.
2177416	2183404	I think many of you were doing what I was doing this week and checking out Starfield with my Game Pass subscription.
2184567	2185348	It was weird.
2185348	2189170	I wasn't sure how I felt about Starfield at first.
2189170	2197836	I was a little bit, you know, especially coming from something like No Man's Sky, which is like relatively simple exploration and very chill.
2197836	2199538	Like, there's a lot more
2200923	2203646	stuff and micromanaging types of things.
2203646	2205148	It's a Bethesda game, right?
2205148	2206269	It's a Bethesda game.
2206269	2209092	And you have to think about how much you're carrying.
2209092	2215920	And when you're setting up the bases, do you have the material, the right way to do this and farming stuff and
2216280	2218542	What really bothered me was the space flight.
2218542	2224286	I did not care for the space flight and how much was going into that as opposed to No Man's Sky.
2224286	2232151	Now granted, the game will let you kind of skip a lot of space flight after the tutorial because you can just fast travel to different places.
2232151	2234312	So that is nice.
2234312	2237014	They do put some quality of life things in there.
2237014	2240737	So like I said, I wasn't quite sure I was feeling the game at first.
2241628	2257659	But I really sat down with it and there was some point where, and again I'm trying to keep it light on spoilers, but you get a companion pretty early on in the game and she wants to go do this certain mission and you're in our solar system that we know today.
2257659	2265285	They call it in the game Sol, S-O-L, but it's the solar system we know today except something has happened to Earth.
2266025	2272636	It looks like a big desert now, which probably is just a commentary on climate change and all of that because that's, you know, probably more likely than you think.
2274335	2275636	But nobody lives on it anymore.
2275636	2278457	But you get to go to the moon.
2278457	2286442	And your companion actually says, if you want to go land on the moon and just play around a little bit, which is funny, because other people I talked to, I guess, didn't get this dialogue option.
2286442	2290904	But because I went diplomat, I think I get maybe some expanded options.
2290904	2294786	And maybe I'm not picking the same things in the dialogue tree that some of you are doing.
2294786	2297868	So she said, Yeah, if you want to go down to the moon, we could do it.
2297868	2298648	It didn't pop it up.
2298648	2300029	But it's just a suggestion she made.
2300029	2301050	It didn't pop a new question or anything.
2301530	2304731	So I went down to the moon, I landed in a very random spot.
2304731	2310654	And then I was just, oh, there's Bobby, there was no Bobby BlackWolf in chat says I have no moon landing spots.
2310654	2312575	Neither did I, I just picked one.
2312575	2315536	I just said we're gonna land here and did it.
2315536	2321458	And I went to a very random moon base that was probably procedurally generated.
2321458	2327221	I picked up a quest from some humans that wanted me to go blast some pirates nearby to heaven.
2327221	2328221	And I went
2328621	2349400	and explored this base for like 90 minutes because I couldn't I didn't I thought this room had a window over it and it turns out it wasn't you could actually jump through the window and so I ran around in circles for like 30 minutes trying to figure this out but once I figured it out I was like okay that actually did feel very rewarding and that was kind of neat
2350200	2364949	Um, so I feel like the game is growing on me more, but I just I get like the overwhelming analysis paralysis that comes with a lot of Bethesda games, when it's like, there's a table over here, and there's crafting you can do here.
2364949	2371474	And there's all these things you can pick up here, but don't pick up too much because you'll be weighted down and lose oxygen faster.
2371474	2377818	But I guess there's, there's plenty of places you can transfer inventory to like your companion or the ship, but it's,
2378788	2379448	It's a lot.
2379448	2379949	It's a lot.
2379949	2387874	But overall, like it's growing on me and my impressions of Starfield are favorable, but it just took me a minute to get there.
2387874	2390655	So that's kind of where I'm at with that game.
2390655	2398260	One other game I want to talk about, which, again, just a random thing that came out the last couple weeks that I think for a lot of you is probably going to be Blink and You Miss It.
2398260	2403163	And I'm going to mention this game and you're going to say, oh, yeah, that did come out.
2403163	2404464	Watch.
2404464	2405204	Watch your reaction.
2405204	2405525	Here we go.
2406465	2425914	So I also checked out this week the Digital Eclipse, I think they call it Gold Series look back of The Making of Karateka, which The Making of Karateka is all about the 1980s Apple II game Karateka, which was ported to the Commodore 64.
2425914	2428255	So they, you know, it's very well known for that tune.
2428255	2430856	It was ported to the Atari, one of the early Ataris as well.
2430856	2434338	And they actually ported some other things to the game does get into this.
2434338	2434498	So
2435318	2445745	It's set up similarly to Atari 50 in that they have all these old letters you can read and they have documentary style videos that are spliced in that you can watch.
2445745	2452069	And they do some really cool things because the whole thing with Karateka and why it was important.
2452069	2456572	Well, funny enough, Fifth Dream in chat says, does that tell how it's actually pronounced now?
2456572	2456632	LOL.
2457773	2458754	Yes and no.
2458754	2462236	So there actually is a video that directly addresses this.
2462236	2468740	And the creator of the game, Jordan, comes up and says, I call it Karateka.
2468740	2473763	That's what I always called it, he says, but apparently everybody else called it Karateka.
2473763	2478325	And he says, and actually, if you go to Japan, there is no emphasis on any syllable.
2478325	2482268	And most people in Japan called it kind of
2482924	2483464	Karateka.
2483464	2483965	Karateka.
2503213	2504714	but it is what it is.
2504714	2509658	So he has said he accepts all pronunciations of the game and that is the official answer.
2509658	2523789	So I just say Karate-ka because that's just, but it's funny because they interview professionals and other developers and things and there is somebody in the video who says, well, I just always thought it was Karate and then Ka, so I always said Karate-ka and I was like, that's it, same brain.
2523789	2525971	That's where my brain always went when I was younger.
2525971	2526712	So yeah.
2527801	2532184	So that was, that was it was neat that it answered questions like that.
2532184	2541450	But some other neat modes is that like, the whole reason why it was infamous in gaming was that it was really a step forward for cinematic games.
2541450	2546614	And the way this is all laid out, and the story that it tells in the game really lays that out.
2546614	2551417	And it's because Jordan used a, and I'm not remembering his last name in the minute, but
2551957	2553199	Belkner.
2553199	2553860	I might be getting there.
2553860	2554460	I'm very sorry.
2554460	2556463	He's also the same guy that made Prince of Persia.
2556463	2556944	Mechner.
2556944	2558726	Thank you.
2558726	2561249	Jordan Mechner made the game.
2561249	2566496	And he used a trick that old Disney animators used in Snow White called rotoscoping.
2566496	2568539	So he actually shot his dad
2569577	2592151	Filming different karate things he had a karate teacher do some stuff, but they didn't have that actual super 8 film footage But they had his dad climbing up onto the hood of the car And they showed how that actually became the protagonist climbing up the cliff in the first scene of the game And they used rotoscoping which is basically putting traceable paper over the super 8 footage one frame at a time
2592446	2594527	to basically make the sprites and clean that up.
2594527	2596568	And that's why that game was so fluid.
2596568	2602471	But they also talk about other ways that that game became more cinematic.
2602471	2606573	And it talks about how Choplifter was very inspiring and making the game more cinematic.
2606573	2609434	It really tells the story about how he
2611108	2612389	did these earlier games.
2612389	2618596	He was trying to sell a game called Death Bounce, which was essentially, long story short, an asteroid clone.
2618596	2623861	Copy, copy, like just refined, refined, refined to its whole new thing that he just really wasn't able to sell to Broderbund.
2623861	2626303	And he just kind of had an awakening when he played Choplifter.
2626303	2628485	He said, why am I trying to make an arcade game?
2629206	2635150	Video games now, because they are on computers and you own them, they can be cinematic experiences.
2635150	2637552	And so he decided he was going to make a cinematic game.
2637552	2644157	And that's where Karateka came from, and how he ended up making that game.
2644157	2646499	And then at the very end, it kind of teases that like,
2647239	2650961	Prince of Persia was the next game, but that's another story.
2650961	2656163	Wink, wink, nudge, like the series might explore that as well in the future.
2656163	2660024	Yeah, Bobby points out he wanted a game that ended with the end and not game over.
2660024	2666907	But anyway, the making of Karateka does a very good job because you can play, like, they talk about all of these prototypes.
2666907	2673010	And if you want to play the very original prototype that Jordan Mechner sent to BrotoBun, you can play that prototype.
2673630	2678013	If you want to play his asteroid clone that he made, you can play that.
2678013	2680115	If you want to play Death Bounce, you can play that.
2680115	2682237	And then they actually did reimagined.
2682237	2688301	So Digital Eclipse made reimagined versions of Death Bounce and Karateka.
2688301	2691343	And they're both very good for reimagined games.
2691343	2702311	I know Digital Eclipse has been in the game for a while, but whoever worked on those reimagines, especially the Death Bounce reimagining, because that game never was released, technically, because they just didn't see a releasable.
2702311	2702792	Well, they saw
2703152	2708117	They saw a releasable game in it, but they wanted to make all these changes that Jordan didn't really want to do.
2708117	2710840	So you can go in and play that.
2710840	2713623	And I thought the remastered Death Bounce was really cool.
2713623	2718688	And yeah, Bobby points out, you can actually watch somebody else play the game and jump in at any point.
2719188	2723112	There's apparently 14 different games in there.
2723112	2729998	But it's when I say different games, it's like 10 of them are Karateka and two of them are Death Bounce and two of them are the Asteroid clones.
2729998	2734562	So it's really just a handful, but you can play the Commodore 64 clone.
2734562	2742149	And they actually have the developer of the 64 version of Karateka named I think Veda Cook is her name.
2744108	2762682	which um she's trans and so she's not credited appropriately in the old version of the game so i was surprised that they did not go back and fix that in the Commodore 64 version of the game but perhaps uh they couldn't at this point i don't know what happened to the source code it could be lost to time or something of that
2763002	2766705	But I thought it was very cool because she explains her relationship with Jordan.
2766705	2774612	And how they you know, she was basically handpicked to do the Commodore 64 port and the Atari port, which I thought it was just a really good story.
2774612	2776814	So there's lots of really good stories.
2776814	2778676	The way it was all laid out like a museum.
2779036	2780217	I really enjoyed as well.
2780217	2782178	It was really like an interactive museum.
2782178	2784539	So anyway, I know I'm talking a lot about this game.
2784539	2788641	And you know, Bobby and I've talked about maybe doing a deeper dive video for the network later on.
2788641	2790422	So I should save some thoughts for that.
2790422	2793384	But I will just say I was I was very impressed by this.
2793384	2796185	And for 20 bucks, it's not a bad deal.
2796185	2797746	I'm gonna be honest.
2797746	2801248	I don't I did play Karateka on the Commodore 64.
2801248	2802609	I didn't like it as a kid.
2802609	2803369	I thought it was too hard.
2803369	2804350	I thought it was too difficult.
2804350	2806131	I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
2806131	2807111	And I thought it was too difficult.
2807111	2807972	They never got very far.
2808652	2817922	But going through this experience gave me an appreciation of like, oh, okay, I see why like this is important.
2817922	2820845	I see how this got to this in gaming.
2820845	2827592	And the fact that, you know, the museum element, the documentary stuff kind of told its own story, I thought was really well done.
2828125	2833893	Now I do have some places I would give constructive feedback, but I'll save that for another time because I've talked about this long enough.
2833893	2838379	But I think there's, there's some parts that were glossed over a little bit for me.
2838379	2844688	And I'm just wondering if it was a rights issue or what, because, okay, I'll quickly say, he made another game.
2845767	2845947	that I
2866619	2870780	Overall, I mean, the issues I have with it are pretty nitpicky.
2870780	2882063	And for a first release in a gold master series, I'm really curious what other games they've got lined up, because they call it number one, it's even on the logo of the game, gold master number one.
2882063	2885344	So you know, they've got a queue of other games they're going to do.
2885344	2891925	Now, I could theorize a guess what some of the other games could be Prince of Persia is an obvious one.
2891925	2893966	However, I thought it was interesting.
2895056	2899662	They interview John Tobias from Mortal Kombat.
2899662	2901224	I'm not sure why they're interviewing.
2901224	2904569	I mean, maybe because he also made a martial arts game.
2904569	2910576	But what if you were interviewing him for something else and you just decided to ask a few questions about Karateka as well?
2910576	2910837	Hmm.
2912430	2931842	By the way, if they were to do one for the original World of Combat, because you know all that motion cap stuff is out there, we were talking about this with DragonCon last year, one of the panels that Bobby got to do, there was some behind the scenes footage of them doing the mocap that they actually showed that had never been seen before, and when I kind of put that
2932342	2941229	together with what I was watching in the Karateka thing, I was like, Oh, fuck, I hope the I hope Mortal Kombat one is like their next museum thing, because that would be incredible.
2941229	2943791	Again, I don't know how rights issues would play into that.
2943791	2946173	So it is a pie in the sky thought that would be amazing.
2946173	2958662	I also noticed they had somebody from ID software, also seemingly randomly interviewed, who happened to be showing off a five and a quarter floppy with return return to Castle Wolfenstein on it.
2958662	2959763	And I was like, Hmm,
2961865	2965567	Wolfenstein 3D could be a very interesting one.
2965567	2971029	So anyway, all my all my thought is is like, I hope there are more.
2971029	2981713	So I do do check this out if this sounds appealing to you and show digital clips and the folks that are involved that we are wanting more of these because I thought it was well done.
2981713	2984454	And I'm really excited for the potential of some of these other things.
2984454	2988276	Again, I am completely making educated guesses based on
2989171	2993797	These seem to be random people being grabbed for an interview, but maybe it's not that random.
2993797	2994317	But we'll see.
2994317	2994578	We'll see.
2996042	2999805	Fifth Dream in chat says just do every game for real.
2999805	3006549	No, but really though, like there's probably a lot of other deep cuts I would have never thought of to do this.
3006549	3009671	You know, I would have never thought I needed a look back at Karateka.
3009671	3013414	Just like I said, when I was a kid, I didn't know better.
3013414	3016036	I didn't have the appreciation for games that I do now.
3016036	3017096	I didn't care for it.
3017096	3019018	And so I haven't thought about it since.
3019018	3022040	But thanks to this experience, I've kind of gone, Oh, wow.
3022780	3031849	Like, I, this is, okay, I get why this game was important, I get the impact that it had on other people, and I get the story about this.
3031849	3036154	And, I mean, I think that says it all right there on why they wanted to do this in the first place, so.
3036930	3038472	All right, that's plenty for me.
3038472	3039593	I've talked a lot about that game.
3039593	3044818	So but I had a feeling a lot of you would be like, Oh, yeah, that came out.
3044818	3047000	Just reminding you because don't don't miss it.
3047000	3048342	We want to see more in this series.
3048342	3049963	I think we really do.
3049963	3053707	It is out on Switch, PC and PlayStation.
3053707	3055989	I'm not sure about Xbox.
3056590	3085662	question mark somebody would have to fact check that and verify I picked it up on PS5 personally because I was just like I like my PS5 and I thought trophies might be fun and I unlocked like two trophies so sadly no trophy for getting 100% on the museum I thought for sure that would be a thing but that's all right okay let's move on and get into some of the other gaming news from this week Loki we will go over to you oh thank you YYR who says yes it's on Xbox thank you okay yeah Loki
3086989	3088350	Playstation Plus is getting more expensive.
3103147	3114603	They're going to be raising the prices across the board for each of the different tiers, and some even more expensive than $20.
3114603	3118968	So, right now in the U.S., PlayStation Plus Essentials 12-month subscription
3120203	3122124	is going to be going up from $59.99 to $79.99.
3122124	3123945	PlayStation Plus Extras 12 month subscription is now up to $134.99 from $99.99.
3123945	3125285	So that's like 35 bucks right there.
3125285	3129287	And then PlayStation Plus Premium 12 month subscription going up from $119.99 to $159.99.
3129287	3129587	So $40.
3129587	3129687	Not
3149726	3156189	Sounded like a great deal to me, but I don't know, maybe.
3156189	3159150	Basically, across the board, yeah, it's getting more expensive.
3159150	3162191	And what's the reasoning for that?
3162191	3164612	I don't know.
3164612	3167153	Probably adding more stuff to the service, I guess.
3167153	3177258	Oh, this price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high quality games and value added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.
3177258	3177758	That's vague.
3179892	3181752	Hmm.
3181752	3185773	Well, keep that in mind when you're subscribing to PlayStation Plus, I guess.
3185773	3193455	You know, the only thing that stinks about that is that a lot of people feel like, excuse me, a large part of their gaming library is being held ransom.
3193455	3199416	Because if you don't keep your subscription to PlayStation Plus going, you lose access to all those games you got through PlayStation Plus.
3199416	3203397	Now, what is unclear, and maybe somebody in chat knows the answer to this.
3203397	3208598	If I were to drop PlayStation Plus and pick it back up later, do I get access to those games back?
3209318	3210859	or is my license okay?
3210859	3211979	Thank heavens.
3211979	3220003	Because that makes me feel better about maybe dropping it because I think I might.
3220003	3222024	My renewal comes up in like November.
3222024	3224405	I'm not sure I play enough online.
3224405	3228127	And like we need to send a message to Sony.
3228127	3230248	And I'm not enough to do that myself.
3231614	3234176	The three of us are not enough to do it ourselves.
3234176	3242542	Even heck, between all of us, the 50 of us, you know, live and all that stuff, I'm being very generous, are probably not enough to have that big of an impact.
3242542	3243342	But you know what?
3243342	3252608	If we all tell friends, and we know other people feel this too, if we all are so bold as to stop our subs, Sony's going to get the message that they need to make it worth it.
3252608	3259333	And I don't think they'll drop the price, but they're going to add to the pot and make a compelling reason on why we need to get the PlayStation subscription.
3259333	3260474	Because as it is right now,
3262307	3262447	What's
3283654	3306867	It's especially bad on the Xbox side of things when real and I don't want to make this a fanboy thing because it's it really isn't that different but it's more obvious on the Xbox side of the house because on your Xbox series you have to pay to do multiplayer but when you're using games for Windows you don't and it's it's a really weird thing now maybe I notice it less and I'm bitching less about Microsoft because well at least
3307507	3314112	you know, when I'm paying for the sub with Microsoft, I'm paying for Game Pass Ultimate at this point, which yes, I know, technically, I don't need Ultimate.
3314112	3324821	But you know, whatever, I'm getting to play things like Starfield, eventually, Sea of Stars is on my radar as well from that and other things with Game Pass where I'm like, okay, whatever, I'm paying for it all with one bundle fee.
3324821	3333108	It doesn't feel like quite the kick to the dick that this PlayStation price increase does where it's like, okay, you're literally not
3333788	3335588	making this worth it.
3335588	3337369	This is like a ransom thing.
3337369	3341090	Give me more money for no reason.
3341090	3342810	Yeah, I just don't know.
3342810	3347011	For me, it hasn't really been something that I've been interested in.
3347011	3352072	I mean, certainly not anymore because I don't really play games on the PlayStation 4 anymore.
3352072	3354593	It's just collecting dust, unfortunately.
3354593	3357654	But I don't know.
3357654	3361635	Even now, I look at PlayStation or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
3362762	3365805	That's $17 a month US, that ends up being $204 a year.
3369907	3371728	That's a lot.
3371728	3375689	I mean, when you break it down like that, that is quite a bit.
3375689	3378550	That's more than what Sony's service is.
3378550	3382891	But like, I don't know, it just doesn't seem that bad to me.
3382891	3390574	And maybe if you like, break it down- Well, when I'm playing a $70 game right now, I only have to do that three times through the year to technically get the value out of it, right?
3390574	3391614	That is true, yeah.
3391614	3393775	That's what it is, I think.
3394512	3401701	So and and I mean, from what I understand with Sony's service is they're not putting their first party games on there right away.
3402690	3413999	They're not day and date with launches, if I'm correct, because they want you to buy those because they feel that their games are worth the money and they want you to pay the money, even though you pay for their service, but they want you to buy it up front.
3413999	3417202	And then later on, if they're gracious enough, they'll give it to you for free.
3417202	3420044	And to be fair, I would say Sony is probably right.
3420044	3424768	They are worth the money, but so are the so are the things that Microsoft is putting out, you know, exactly.
3424768	3425689	So, yeah.
3427590	3428511	Shane is in our chat.
3428511	3437077	Shadley Lynn says, I actually cancelled my renewal because their justification of the increase is pathetic and vastly overstated the quality of their offerings.
3437077	3439159	No more online games or extra games.
3439159	3442181	I'm tired of arrogant Sony this generation.
3442181	3444983	That last sentence says a lot.
3444983	3448486	And I think I agree with it a lot.
3448486	3451328	That is, I'm also tired of arrogant Sony this generation.
3452508	3460372	And I don't like to root for people getting L's in the gaming industry because I know a lot of people get affected by that.
3460372	3463253	I don't like to say such sweeping things.
3463253	3465014	It's like everybody there ought to be fired.
3465014	3466775	That's not that's not how I really feel.
3466775	3475679	And I know that like like you were saying earlier during the Volition story, people that didn't make the decisions on where to go with the story were impacted by the game.
3475679	3477820	And that's that's too bad.
3477820	3480882	But there comes there comes a point where I'm like, you know what?
3481904	3486032	When the PSVR2 flops, I'm not gonna be sad for Sony.
3486663	3500110	Well, it's the way I see it like this is desperation breeds innovation, because if they are put in last place like they were with like PlayStation 3, they tried harder when PlayStation 4 came out.
3500110	3504392	That's when we got LittleBigPlanet and like some really rad games, right?
3504392	3507774	So like, yeah, I think Sony should feel the heat a little bit.
3507774	3513057	And it's I'm not sure they learned from what happened with the PS3 because this is
3514007	3517397	This carries a very similar weight to the phrase $599 USD.
3521870	3526194	It does, I mean, because their console's expensive.
3526194	3540105	Just even the proposition of PlayStation VR right now, I've completely just given up any sort of hope to actually play my wonderful spiritual successor to Until Dawn Rush of Blood.
3540105	3546371	Because I'm not buying the system and the VR for like, what, is it going to be close to $1,000 at that point?
3548232	3553661	So thanks, I'm good, you know, and I just will skip Sony this generation.
3553661	3558989	And honestly, like, considering how much I play my Xbox, which is not at all, it's in a box.
3559971	3564292	I'll just skip consoles this next generation too, because PC is the way to go.
3564292	3565692	Like I get the best of everything.
3565692	3567473	I get all of the games.
3567473	3571353	None of this BS about paying for multiplayer online.
3571353	3582216	And like if they start pulling this, I was like, OK, well, I'll just play thousands of other games that are available all through all these marketplaces because of competition and competition pushes those prices down.
3582216	3583816	You have a walled garden.
3583816	3586296	You got to pay whatever they're telling you to pay.
3586296	3588957	Bobby's needling you in chat saying you only play Minecraft anyway.
3589795	3590696	That is true.
3590696	3592858	And to be fair, you are absolutely correct.
3592858	3602746	I am hyper focused on Minecraft, but I but that is to say, you know, and because I have a horrible habit of doing this, I still buy a lot of games.
3602746	3604407	I just don't play them.
3604407	3607990	But I buy lots of games on PC.
3607990	3608130	Yeah.
3608635	3609816	Then I'll play eventually.
3609816	3613759	You know, when I retire, I'll be dead before that happens.
3613759	3619444	But, you know, like, it'll be just, you know, they'll be there so that somebody can play them someday.
3619444	3623828	Or I will just collect them like you would, like, I don't know, bobbleheads or something.
3624200	3628664	Shane in chat says, remember when everyone was crapping on Nintendo for their service and price?
3628664	3633207	It honestly feels like the best value to me right now for the price, the NSO plus expansion.
3633207	3635689	Yes, I do remember that because I was one of the people crapping on it.
3635689	3641674	But I will say I thought you'll notice two years later, I finally did sign up this week because I was like, you know what?
3641674	3644737	Yeah, they've added a lot to NSO.
3644737	3650742	And you know, on N64 and Advance and even just you know, I was like, Oh, I could get those Mario Kart tracks and stuff for free.
3650742	3651562	You know what?
3651562	3652083	Fuck it.
3652083	3653324	I'm gonna finally sign up for that.
3653684	3657827	So it took me a little while to get there, but like, yeah, like, honestly.
3657827	3663170	And then the other thing I just want to say about PSVR 2 real quick is that, you know, and I've said this before, but I'll say it again.
3663170	3672457	It's very sad that Sony is not learning this lesson because I really feel like the PSVR 2 is destined for the similar fate, the PlayStation Vita, the PlayStation TV.
3672457	3678020	It's a terrific piece of hardware, horribly supported by Sony.
3678020	3680142	And I don't, I don't understand why.
3680995	3692023	They need to, like, honestly, like, I think the best course of action for Sony and something like that, and it's like, I get it, you gotta push those graphics and everything, but you gotta develop something like the MetaQuest.
3692023	3700869	Like, honestly, because that is, as much as I hate meta, like, that piece of hardware is, like, my kids play that all the time.
3701392	3728234	like all the time and they love it's just so easy to use and it's it's decent enough to run games and you know pretty decent games so all they need to do is just something like that that's not attached to a $500 console and I get it like you know it pushes the graphics and stuff but is it really worth it to like be that high end on that because like you're really narrowing the market like if you expand it make it more broad you could have a thing take off like
3728805	3733709	You know, imagine Sony titles on like, you know, a Quest type of product where it's easy.
3733709	3742497	You know, it's like a couple hundred bucks to get in and then you're playing the Sony catalog stuff like that's what they need to do, not wall it off with a thousand dollars worth.
3742497	3746400	How well is that going to work for for Apple with their thing?
3746400	3753026	Like that's an amazing piece of hardware, but it's just like no one's going to buy it because it's so expensive.
3753026	3753746	And that's the thing.
3753746	3756689	It's we're waiting for all these prices to come down, but just
3757850	3758330	I don't know.
3758330	3760973	I think they need to do something that's its own thing.
3760973	3763995	I want to get a couple other comments out here and then I'll move on to the next story for time.
3763995	3769180	But Crystal Skies in our chat, hello, hello, says they need to make it backwards compatible.
3769180	3775185	You know, and that was a problem is that they did make a hardware design choice to it.
3775185	3778788	They can't make it backwards compatible because the VR works in a completely different way.
3778788	3781210	And that's why you're seeing things like No Man's Sky,
3781630	3792553	Tetris effect and things getting like re-released for PSVR 2, because they really are new releases, because they have to adapt to the new way that PlayStation VR 2 handles VR versus the first.
3792553	3793673	That was a choice they made.
3793673	3798714	And you know, I, I get why they did it, because that's where the tech is going.
3798714	3803455	And it does allow them, you know, probably a better VR experience at the end of the day.
3803455	3804336	But yeah, it does suck.
3804336	3805576	Like it's just like that.
3805576	3809037	And that's the way a lot of people see it, is that comment right there.
3809037	3809897	So yes.
3810608	3822512	Yeah, it's the problem is what it's always been is some of these consoles that they put out, you know, and I'm considering this like a console almost for Sony is they don't have the must have system seller game on it.
3822512	3824253	I'm sorry, the Horizon game.
3824253	3825353	That wasn't it.
3825353	3827854	Like, that was just not a neat experience, though.
3827854	3829154	I did get to mess around that.
3829154	3829874	It's yeah.
3829874	3832835	And Bobby and Chad says the tech and PSVR2 is pretty good.
3832835	3833976	It really is.
3833976	3837117	Like if they just would put the first party games behind it,
3837737	3846482	to really sell it, like give it a Half-Life Alyx or something, you know, like a God of War game, like Warrior Kratos and you're throwing the axe and stuff like that.
3846482	3848623	Like that could be really sweet.
3848623	3852586	Give it a Spider-Man game, like swinging around on a web and stuff like that.
3852586	3854307	It sounds motion sick, though.
3854307	3854627	I don't know.
3854627	3855087	I get it.
3855087	3855568	I get it.
3855568	3856528	Calm it down a little bit.
3856528	3857309	Calm it down a little bit.
3857309	3859330	Some people might like that.
3859330	3862912	Like you could do something like that where it'd be really cool and just
3864145	3880757	But it's it's unfortunately it's going to go the way like a lot of these Sony products do is where they just kind of like just forget about it and it goes off and then we're like you know several summer game fests down the road and we're like hey where's all those PlayStation VR 2 titles and then the next thing you know oh yeah we stopped supporting it.
3881487	3883247	What Vita, you know?
3883247	3884708	One more comment in chat here.
3884708	3887529	Shane says PSVR 2 already feels dead.
3887529	3888629	They never talk about it.
3888629	3891430	I don't even know about things coming out for it because they don't talk about it.
3891430	3893930	I can't follow every developer making games for it.
3893930	3897551	So the games just go unnoticed since Sony ignores it.
3897551	3899212	Ouch, but true.
3899212	3901152	All right, let's move on.
3901152	3903613	Our next story is about kind of an update.
3904153	3906875	Excuse me, just something we talked about two weeks ago on the show.
3906875	3912540	And that is the fact that, as we know, Charles Martinet will no longer be voicing Mario.
3912540	3914481	There is a new voice actor in Mario Wonder.
3914481	3915962	They are still not saying who that is.
3915962	3918825	I guess we just get to find out when the credits roll in the game.
3918825	3921066	What if it's the Final Fantasy 16 guy?
3921066	3922307	No, it's not.
3922307	3922988	It's not.
3922988	3927952	And like I said, I, I understand why they kind of are keeping it under wraps, because
3929388	3932431	That person is going to get bullied, unfortunately, and it sucks.
3932431	3933131	And they shouldn't.
3933131	3937294	I want to make it very clear that type of behavior online is fucked up.
3937294	3939836	But unfortunately... What if they don't get?
3939836	3941298	What if they're not?
3941298	3942238	They will.
3942238	3943299	You hang out on Twitter.
3943299	3946242	They're absolutely going to get bullied because they're not Charles Martinet.
3946242	3947403	They're going to.
3947403	3955509	Because the environment created on Twitter by the person that runs Twitter only lends itself to hyper-focusing that environment and making it worse.
3955509	3956570	Who said they have to be on Twitter?
3957532	3957872	I don't know.
3975052	3984241	I honestly think that there'll be those of us who are like, I'd say the true fan, but those who will be like, welcome to the family.
3984241	3984822	Yeah.
3984822	3987124	You know, I am.
3987124	3995813	I would rather focus on, you know, I think that if the people who are like welcoming speak louder than the people who are haters, then that's going to make all the difference.
3995953	4004215	That's a very good point is that, you know, we can, you know, send some love to counteract all of that negativity that we know is coming.
4004215	4015037	The part I want to say with that, though, is that I don't think it's a good decision on Nintendo's part to make people wait until the credits because that information will get leaked as soon as those press coffees are out there.
4015037	4015618	Coffees?
4015618	4016418	Copies are out there.
4016418	4018378	It doesn't matter what embargo you put on it.
4018378	4020019	That name will leak out.
4020019	4025520	So Nintendo, my question to you is, do you want to control the narrative or do you want Twitter to control the narrative?
4025920	4030682	because right now, out of Doug Bowser's mouth, I'm hearing, I want Twitter to control the narrative.
4030682	4032362	I think that's a poor decision.
4032362	4040264	So I do hope Nintendo will allow this new voice actor to be properly introduced before the game comes out.
4040264	4040945	But that's my thought.
4040945	4041365	But anyway,
4042085	4049475	A nice video that they did do was that they actually did a video with Charles Martinet and Miyamoto.
4049475	4051157	There wasn't really new information in it.
4051157	4058226	They were just kind of talking about Charles Martinet's new role as the ambassador, and you kind of got to hear it out of his mouth where Charles Martinet was like,
4058566	4061147	Hey, I'm really happy to be doing this role.
4061147	4065768	It's been an honor to be voicing Mario for years, but I'm so excited to come to conventions and meet all of you.
4065768	4066708	It was a very nice thing.
4066708	4072029	It was the kind of thing where I'm kind of surprised they didn't release that with the news two weeks ago.
4072029	4073730	But okay, it is what it is.
4073730	4075930	And it's coming out now.
4075930	4079891	Plus, I think it was very nice of Charles Martinet to be a good sport.
4079891	4081692	Because technically, he wasn't
4082252	4087233	required to be, but I get that he wants to continue this good relationship with Nintendo.
4087233	4096315	And he, you know, to be fair to Nintendo, they were treating him better than unfortunately, a lot of voice actors get treated in this industry.
4096315	4105237	Like I was literally just looking at Jennifer Hale's Twitter the other day, and she just casually said, Oh, yeah, I got replaced on this cartoon I was on because they didn't want to pay union rates anymore.
4106555	4115946	She's like, and that's, you know, that's how I found out when the new season got announced with the with the new voice actors, you know, and so a lot of voice actors are not treated very kindly in this industry.
4115946	4120651	So I will give credit to Nintendo that like they, they, they made a decision.
4120651	4122073	They're sticking to it.
4122073	4124375	They're handling it with grace best they can.
4124375	4125717	So I will give them all of that.
4127138	4133783	But like I said two weeks ago, if you really want to show Charles Martinet how much you love him, pay him for an autograph when he comes to your town.
4133783	4136386	Pay him for an autograph and a selfie when he comes to your town.
4136386	4138347	That is the best way to express your love.
4138347	4142791	So there you go.
4142791	4143671	Yeah, thank you.
4143671	4144712	Totally spies.
4144712	4145613	Thank you, Ranma.
4145613	4147715	Appreciate that.
4147715	4149736	Anyway, let's move on.
4149736	4151117	We have some more news.
4151117	4151618	DarkSakura,
4156381	4158783	There we go, now my unmute button is working.
4158783	4163146	So, I heard you.
4163146	4174715	So, this is a, I mean, honestly, I'm not surprised by it because it's Nintendo, but they have said that there are no plans for any DLC.
4175676	4179278	for Tears of the Kingdom.
4179278	4184521	I mean, they hardly had DLC for Breath of the Wild, so I wasn't expecting anything.
4184521	4191406	I always expect Nintendo to bring out, you know, if they're doing a game, they're going to do a whole game.
4191406	4192426	Breath of the Wild had DLC.
4192426	4193947	Hmm?
4193947	4194988	Breath of the Wild had DLC.
4194988	4197009	I said it had, it barely had DLC.
4197009	4197549	Oh, you're right.
4197549	4198170	Yeah, I don't know.
4198170	4198430	Barely.
4199773	4203116	I also just found a piece of string cheese that's been on my desk since last night.
4203116	4204658	Oops.
4204658	4206580	There's some DLC right there.
4206580	4210764	It's an unopened string cheese, but anyway, back to this.
4210764	4220394	Basically, and this is the quote from Alnuma, there are no plans to release additional content this time because I feel like I've done everything I can to create games in that world.
4221034	4230758	In the first place, the reason why we chose this time as a sequel to the previous game is because we thought there would be value and experience in a new kind of play in that place in Hyrule.
4230758	4235840	Then, if such a reason is newly born, it may return to the same world again.
4235840	4237701	This is translation, clearly.
4237701	4243363	Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play, so I'd be happy if you could look forward to it.
4244803	4256290	Translation is, we don't want to provide you with more items to build things out of because you've already made so many pornographic things already that we're afraid.
4256290	4257431	Yeah.
4257431	4266117	No, I just think that, you know, when Nintendo puts out a game, a first party game, you know,
4267132	4276737	they tend to put out a fairly complete project that fulfills the goal they set out as far as storytelling and experience.
4276737	4282500	So, I don't know, I've never expected DLC with first-party Nintendo games.
4282500	4289464	So, I mean, when the stuff came out for Breath of the Wild, I was pretty surprised, honestly.
4289464	4290145	You know, so...
4291025	4299973	I mean, it's not something like Splatoon that would be something that's a continuous, ongoing, non-singular story.
4299973	4306759	You know, this is its own entity, and honestly, I have no problem with this.
4306759	4309842	I mean, people, y'all ain't entitled to extra shit, y'all.
4310671	4315695	I actually would love to see DLC on older games, like older games, like the original Zelda.
4315695	4320878	Let's give me a third and fourth quest or, you know, like new characters.
4320878	4323500	You know, the fan community is already taking care of that.
4323500	4325301	I mean, yeah, I get that.
4325301	4325902	I get that.
4325902	4327723	But like, you know, it would still be cool.
4327723	4334308	Like they do the like save state things, which is fine, but like it would be really cool like to just, OK, let's do these things that we can push, you know,
4334908	4339953	We couldn't have done on the Nintendo because we didn't have the memory space but now we can push it to whatever we want.
4339953	4342074	ELC for Animal Crossing for GameCube.
4342074	4344597	Super Mario 35 is what I'm hearing.
4344597	4348160	That's that technically is the old game with a new twist, right?
4348160	4350422	So which I don't know why it was limited time.
4350422	4357227	And you know, there's rumors rumors that FF0 is going to get a 99 game.
4357227	4358749	Could be interesting.
4358749	4358909	So.
4360315	4366076	But I definitely agree with what Jamie said about Nintendo games.
4366076	4366856	It's an accurate statement.
4366856	4369017	Nintendo games are pretty fully featured.
4369017	4373598	We think of Nintendo as a company that releases relatively bug-free.
4373598	4375078	I shouldn't say 100% bug-free.
4375078	4376018	Relatively.
4376018	4378219	Yeah, relatively, compared to some of their peers.
4378219	4382340	They do very good with that and always doing a fully featured type of product.
4383240	4387244	If something's going to have that Nintendo seal of approval on it, it's going to have earned it.
4406400	4412982	It's not like it's going to hurt the game in the long run because the game itself is fully, one of these days I'll get around to playing it, is fully featured.
4412982	4415002	And you know, you're not going to be disappointed.
4415002	4418003	And it's because they're working on a Switch 2 anyway.
4418003	4426225	Like at this point, like, you're not going to do it because the Switch 2 would be out by the time this DLC would, hypothetical DLC would come out anyway.
4426225	4426865	So they're just moving on.
4426865	4429785	I didn't stop them from releasing Breath of the Wild.
4429785	4430226	No, that's true.
4430226	4433526	Well, Breath of the Wild ended up being a dual release.
4433526	4435927	So yeah, they could, you know,
4436988	4447274	They may say that, yeah, we're not releasing DLC, but there could be a special edition that comes out that has more content in it.
4447274	4451817	That's technically not DLC and technically is the best type of being right.
4451817	4457061	So in a hundred clip that we're going to be watching this in six months when that's true.
4457061	4458342	That is it.
4458342	4459222	That's why there's no DLC.
4461679	4461959	Maybe.
4492167	4501194	Um, so there's rumors that last month during Gamescom that developers were shown a Switch 2 behind closed doors.
4501194	4504176	Um, basically, allegedly, yes.
4504176	4510121	Uh, Eurogamer had said that partners were shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run.
4510121	4519128	And is, um, there is one such demo was a souped up version of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
4519128	4519468	Ironic.
4520310	4524172	Ironic that they would be doing that.
4524172	4531795	Lots of rumors regarding specs and stuff that I've seen too, but I don't want to speculate in specs.
4531795	4534916	Ray tracing and DLSS and all that stuff like that.
4534916	4539578	We'll see what they come out with when they announce it, which will happen eventually.
4540333	4541154	After the holiday.
4541154	4543478	They're not going to cannibalize holiday sales.
4543478	4545401	No way, if anything, about this business.
4545401	4547123	No, it's not holiday for sure.
4547123	4550388	I mean, next year, maybe.
4550388	4552291	Next holiday, possibly.
4552291	4555576	But yeah, I mean... We'll see.
4555576	4555917	We'll see.
4557313	4560215	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4575967	4576307	DarkSakura
4606395	4615109	I think the specs are still being negotiated and they might have shown the higher end of things but I don't think that necessarily means it's the final product.
4615109	4618455	So yeah, there's a lot of that stuff still to be figured out.
4619653	4627837	Okay, another thing that kind of dates back to Gamescom a little bit, but this was this Pikmin Finder AR game that came out.
4627837	4633920	It's not Pikmin Bloom, and it's not Pokemon Go, but it's another Nintendo and Niantic partnership.
4633920	4635361	It's Pikmin Finder.
4635361	4640263	It's an AR game that lets you scan the environment for Pikmin and treasures.
4640263	4643125	There's a little link, it's pikmin-finder.nintendo.net.
4644185	4647547	and you go on it on your mobile device, you do a little QR code.
4647547	4650830	And that's that's how you get it all started.
4650830	4656234	Essentially, honestly, I haven't really played around with this because it's just a way to just scan the environment.
4656234	4661077	They're trying to like scam people into like doing more 3D scans of locations and stuff like that.
4661217	4669705	No, but Niantic also already has a game like this called Peridot that they put out and I played Peridot for about a week.
4669705	4671927	And because there's there's no game there.
4671927	4676352	It's one of those things that's like, Oh, that's interesting for about three days.
4676352	4678614	And then you're like, Okay, I've seen it all done.
4678614	4682978	And the the monetization in that game is horrific.
4684130	4684911	Horrific.
4699708	4707811	It's for those of you that didn't think I meant it when I said that a few weeks ago, I no longer have a subscription to Ingress Core or whatever, whatever the thing is, it's gone.
4707811	4714414	So but I am for fit because I recognize that I like to gamify my fitness.
4714414	4718015	I do still play Pokemon Go and I play Pikmin Bloom.
4718015	4721237	I haven't given any of those games a red cent since
4722220	4725482	the incident happened where I reported a cheater and nothing was done about it.
4725482	4726563	And I'm over it.
4726563	4733587	I'm not, I'm not supporting this system that is weakly and that does not have enforcement behind it.
4733587	4735048	So anyway,
4736265	4742207	Um, and as far as this demo goes, I mean, I'm sure it's cute, but it's probably cute for five minutes.
4742207	4749410	And I've already seen that Niantic has been pushing this technology for quite some time now between Peridot and some of these other things.
4749410	4755472	It's time to show how you can actually make a fun game out of it, because Peridot isn't it.
4755472	4757513	So show us.
4757513	4758733	I'm going to just be very blunt.
4758733	4761414	Show us the fucking point.
4761414	4763175	You know, like, like, I don't know.
4764138	4765799	Not a Nintendo game.
4765799	4768962	I would still love them to see something like, uh, Elebits.
4768962	4770023	Remember Elebits?
4770023	4772966	That was a fun game from Konami.
4772966	4774407	Like, they should do something like that.
4774407	4775428	Like, that would be cool.
4775428	4777089	I mean, I guess that's almost like Pikmin.
4777089	4781574	You know, finding stuff hidden in your environment, but... Yeah, I don't know.
4781574	4785837	Niantic is kind of... out of ideas, I guess.
4785837	4788380	They like to license and make shells of, like, games.
4788967	4790567	They have some gameplay to them.
4790567	4793928	But you know, it's basically monetization machines.
4793928	4797729	I, and I've said this before, and I'm going to be very careful not to repeat myself.
4797729	4803971	But the problem is, is that they are married to their mission statement more than they're married to their player base.
4803971	4805652	That's a problem.
4805652	4810353	The reason why that's happening is because the individual running the company is he is a smart guy.
4810353	4811613	He's a brilliant mind.
4811613	4813414	This is the guy behind Google Maps.
4813414	4815654	He's done a lot of very smart things.
4815654	4817715	You know what he hasn't done run a game company.
4818711	4820112	And that's the other problem.
4820112	4820993	So what are you?
4820993	4823254	Are you a game company?
4823254	4826616	Or are you a get out and explore the world company?
4826616	4833041	Because it's starting to show that being both of those things is very, very difficult.
4833041	4841046	So get the help you need, or admit that you're not a game company because you're not running it like one.
4841046	4843507	Anyway, let's move on to our next story.
4843507	4844148	DarkSakura.
4846008	4852150	Uh, so, there's finally a specific home port of a game, but not quite how you think it's gonna be.
4852150	4862614	So, Daytona USA 2 is finally coming home, but it's because it's built into, uh, Like a Dragon Gaiden, uh, the man who erased his name.
4865756	4870721	The other game had some old Sega titles in it.
4870721	4879670	So this one is Daytona USA 2, but it's going to be under the non-licensed name Sega Racing Classic 2.
4881752	4890699	And then also in the game is going to be Fighting Vipers 2 and some Master System ports of Flicky and Galaxy Force.
4890699	4895423	The game will be out on November 9th this year.
4895423	4899326	But I mean, I would just like them to go.
4899326	4902249	I just want more Sega Ages and bring something like that back out.
4902667	4908471	Like, like, legit, the Yakuza Sega Arcade stuff is really cool.
4908471	4917558	Like, I would love, like, a Sega Arcade that has, like, all of what they've done throughout that series, like, in one package, and I think they could sell that, and it would work.
4918238	4931870	Yeah, it's so weird that like a modern AAA game nowadays can put, you know, older games that they published into the game and not charge people extra for that, Nintendo.
4931870	4935073	Sega does what Nintendo don't.
4935073	4936535	Oh, come back.
4936535	4941980	Yep.
4941980	4942380	I love it.
4943390	4956017	So I think the real question, and I bet Bobby would want to know the answer to this, DarkSakura, with this getting the home port and everything, is this how you might play Yakuza?
4956017	4958698	Did I ever say I wasn't gonna play it?
4958698	4960619	Oh, okay.
4960619	4965582	I mean, I'm on a Mac.
4965582	4966703	There's no way for me to play it.
4967968	4974372	Oh, yeah, because I, I feel like like a dragon was I could be wrong was on state, but it's cloud gaming is probably the way to do it.
4974372	4978194	No, it came out after Stadia shut down.
4978194	4981956	And I mean, it might be on GeForce now.
4981956	4983377	I mean, I don't know.
4983377	4989561	But um, I never said I was never gonna play it.
4989561	4993163	It's Halo I won't play.
4993163	4994884	Screw Halo.
4994884	4996164	All right.
4996164	4997165	Next story, Loki.
4998379	5007464	So apparently the announcement is that Nitara is back and being played by Megan Fox.
5007464	5012807	So she's not only going to be doing the voice for the character, but also doing the mocap for it as well, which is pretty cool.
5014031	5018293	And, you know, she, of course, in the reveal trailer said, you know, she comes from this weird realm.
5018293	5020314	She's the type of vampire creature.
5020314	5021774	She's evil, but she's also good.
5021774	5023675	She's trying to save her people.
5023675	5024615	I really like her.
5024615	5029177	She's a vampire, which obviously resonates for whatever reason.
5029177	5030498	Is it because you're a vampire?
5030498	5035180	Megan Fox, are you a vampire?
5035180	5036980	She also said that I'm not really voicing it.
5036980	5040642	She's kind of me.
5040642	5041442	So that's kind of funny.
5042048	5043248	Because she's a vampire.
5043248	5044269	She is a vampire.
5044269	5046850	Confirmed, Megan Fox, vampire.
5046850	5049971	Wow, Megan Fox is so goth, you all.
5049971	5051471	She's so goth.
5051471	5052992	No, I think it's cool.
5052992	5054132	It's whatever.
5054132	5056233	Did you watch the trailer for it?
5056233	5058234	We're actually playing it on B-roll right now.
5058234	5061435	So yeah, I mean, no, I mean, I mean, but like, hear her voice.
5061435	5062395	Yeah, no, I'm poking.
5062395	5063596	I'm poking fun at it.
5063596	5065196	But like, I do think it's cool.
5065196	5066497	Like, it is a good job.
5066497	5066697	Yeah.
5067222	5075425	No, and I like that like, you know, Hollywood or like, you know, classic Hollywood or whatever you want to call it is crossing over more and more into games like this.
5075425	5081567	Because, you know, we all remember a day when games were like, you wouldn't see trip.
5081567	5089910	Well, I don't know if Megan Fox is triple A, but she's probably at least a, you know, A list movie stars participating in things like this.
5089910	5092331	And now it's it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto or something.
5092331	5093692	Yeah, it's very commonplace.
5093692	5094332	So I think it's cool.
5095242	5099424	Did you also see, though, what the other thing coming out for Mortal Kombat 1 is?
5099424	5101745	The other skin for Johnny Cage?
5101745	5103746	Oh, oh, it's Van Damme.
5103746	5105027	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5105027	5107028	Which is.
5107028	5109849	And I think that is him doing the voicing, I think.
5109849	5111470	Yeah.
5111470	5115792	He was supposed to originally have been the character that Johnny Cage became.
5115792	5116432	Yeah.
5116432	5117653	How full circle is that?
5117653	5120994	Oh, I completely forgot that Jean-Claude Van Damme was doing that.
5120994	5122095	That's awesome.
5122095	5122295	Yeah.
5122647	5123709	Yeah, that's really cool.
5123709	5128076	There's honestly some pretty good talent involved in that game.
5128076	5128817	Yeah.
5128817	5132022	We finally got our Street Fighter X Mortal Kombat now.
5133643	5136745	This is not how we thought, but you know, how fun.
5136745	5138746	Well, that means somebody could do that in Mugen.
5138746	5144409	They could take Guile versus Johnny Cage, both Jean-Claude Van Damme.
5144409	5145410	And we could finally see that.
5145410	5145850	Exactly.
5145850	5147431	You know, that's coming.
5147431	5149973	Let's see a lot of comments in chat lighting up about this.
5149973	5152334	Crystal Skies in chat says, I mean, J.K.
5152334	5155456	Simmons and Jason Isaacs in Baldur's Gate 3 is amazing.
5155456	5156556	Yes.
5156556	5157137	Keep in mind.
5157137	5157277	J.K.
5157277	5159018	Simmons in anything is awesome.
5159298	5166764	Jason Isaacs was also in Marvel's Midnight Suns as Mephisto, and he was perfect.
5166764	5173929	Also something to keep in mind with the strike going on right now, video games are something that celebrities can work with.
5173929	5175891	The Screen Actors Guild can work with, at least for now.
5175891	5179954	Yes, I've heard about the whole voting in advance to authorize a strike.
5179954	5181355	I'm well aware of that situation.
5181735	5185680	But we haven't heard of a strike being authorized on the games industry yet.
5185680	5188423	So for now, you know, Screen Actors Guild still work there.
5188423	5199037	I wonder if we're not going to see more of these types of collaborations, you know, in a year, a year and a half's time, because it allows the some of the actors to work could be very interesting.
5199037	5199657	See what happens.
5201239	5210005	Also, Questbuster in chat warns, in addition to the Mortal Kombat 1 story, the full story was already leaked and exists in clips out there, so watch out.
5210005	5213827	Yeah, well, that game is also out this coming week, I think.
5213827	5214287	Very soon.
5214287	5217089	Yeah, if you have the collector's edition, it's on the 15th.
5217089	5219771	Otherwise, you gotta wait until next Tuesday.
5219771	5222073	That's still not very long.
5222073	5226035	They're very good at announcing those games, and then they're coming out like three months later.
5226035	5227116	So, yeah.
5228459	5228859	Elder Scrolls 6
5247393	5252276	I think this is evidence that went in with Microsoft's battle with the FTC.
5252276	5263024	There was some vagueness about if this game would be Xbox only, because of course, they don't want the courts to think, you know, there's going to be antitrust problems or whatever.
5263024	5270469	So they say, with Elder Scrolls 6, it's so far out, it's hard to understand what the platforms will even be.
5270469	5274011	We're talking about a game that's five plus years away.
5274011	5274512	Remember that?
5275132	5283958	Well, in an interview with Bloomberg this week, Phil Spencer was asked again about Elder Scrolls 6, saying, We look at it on a case by case basis with the games we build.
5283958	5290683	We want to make sure our games are available in so many different places on our Xbox consoles, on PC, also via cloud.
5290683	5293685	These games can come to almost any web enabled device.
5293685	5299389	We're looking at millions and millions of players who will have access to Starfield and other Xbox Game Studios games.
5299389	5304093	It's really about giving players choice around how they want to play and build their library games.
5306348	5310751	I mean, like, look, he answered it in that quote right there.
5310751	5311571	And this is the thing.
5311571	5315413	I understand this doesn't generate clicks for your website and all that stuff.
5315413	5317554	But really look at what he's saying.
5317554	5323698	And he can't he can't say it so explicitly because there are still court things going on with Microsoft.
5323698	5332503	Granted, Microsoft says Microsoft Bethesda was settled a long time ago, but they're still trying to project this image of Oh, yeah, we were gonna put our games everywhere.
5332943	5334665	Activision Blizzard come be a part of that.
5334665	5338128	Yeah, you know, they want to project that image to all these regulatory bodies around the world.
5338128	5340110	So he can't be explicit yet.
5340110	5352361	If you read between the lines in that comment, he literally says, between Xbox on the between Xbox Cloud, Xbox system, and PC, we're gonna get this game everywhere.
5352361	5355263	We don't need PlayStation 5.
5355263	5355744	That's right.
5355744	5356865	He's saying without saying.
5357760	5368623	Yeah, and nor should the FTC be, like, suggesting that they need to put that game on a PlayStation console, because, like, I'm sorry, Sony, they're not publishing Spider-Man on Xbox.
5368623	5370523	Like, why the double standards here?
5370523	5373104	Like, I don't even understand why they would push that.
5373104	5383167	And I'm sure that somebody in the FTC is just not clear enough to realize that, like, a Bethesda game is not an Activision game, and it's completely two different scenarios here, but...
5384347	5388989	Yeah, it's a stupid thing to even inquire about.
5388989	5391750	I don't understand.
5391750	5397673	Elder Scrolls VI is exclusive to Microsoft, I guarantee it.
5397673	5400174	I don't know why we're continuing to debate this.
5402750	5403870	look at what they're saying.
5403870	5408692	It's going to be exclusive 100% especially the way he compares it to Starfield.
5408692	5416475	Hello, Starfield just went through this exact same speculation and questions and talk arounds and all this stuff.
5416475	5417535	And what happened?
5417535	5419016	It's exclusive.
5419016	5421977	Elder Scrolls six will be and and and that's okay.
5421977	5430680	Microsoft is buying these big companies so they can have exclusives to take on Sony's what Sony's got and refuses to put out on all of their devices.
5431880	5433283	That's another interesting thing.
5433283	5434325	Well, nevermind.
5434325	5435807	We'll, we'll go to that another day.
5435807	5436509	All right.
5436509	5437511	Um, moving on.
5437511	5444203	Let's, let's, let's go back to a more classic time in this next segment, as we usually do.
5454972	5462737	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5462737	5466139	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5466139	5471142	All right, but DarkSakura, you have a classic non-game tonight, if I remember right.
5471142	5474885	So what did you pick for us tonight?
5474885	5481229	I picked Connect Four, another game that has made enemies of entire families.
5482828	5498921	So it is gone by other names, not just Connect4 with the number 4 or spelled out 4, but 4UP, Plot4, Find4, Captain's Mistress, 4inarow, Drop4, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union.
5498921	5501163	I'm only going to call it Captain's Mistress from now on.
5502245	5504888	I'm kind of down for that.
5504888	5518082	But at any rate, you have two colors and your goal is to make four in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
5523396	5535299	Basically, it's already what's referred to as a solved game, meaning that it's one that you can predict as long as people play perfectly.
5535299	5550403	Now, the thing about this one is that the official Kinect 4 trademark came out in February 1974 by Milton Bradley, but the theories behind the game have already existed well before that.
5552215	5562699	So I don't know if anyone remembers the pretty sneaky cis commercial, because they redid that commercial a couple of times in the history of that game.
5562699	5568501	But as it said in that commercial, connect four of your checkers in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
5568501	5573882	But look out, your opponent can sneak up on you and win the game.
5573882	5581345	So it actually has a lot more to go with a little bit of a mathematical
5585364	5590933	It's what's referred to as a zero-sum game.
5600070	5606134	There are two sides, but one is strictly advantaged and one is strictly disadvantaged.
5606134	5622764	So, um, but the first time the game was ever solved, like completely, was, uh, by James Dal Allen on October 1st, 1988, and then independently by Victor Alice on October 16th, 1988.
5622764	5629108	And it basically was by developing strategy to mathematically figure out where
5629902	5631766	Thanks for watching!
5640145	5653095	They actually, they've even had AI applied to it to figure out all the various different formulas that could be used to decide optimal gameplay.
5653095	5658339	But the biggest thing with the Kinect 4 is that, honestly, the first one who does it first is the winner.
5658339	5668307	You know, who makes it... We used to play, like, not the first person to get the 4, but how many could you get out of the board?
5669521	5672387	You know, so it was it was pretty, pretty interesting.
5672387	5676775	Oh, like how many four connections could you get once all the pieces were played?
5676775	5677256	Exactly.
5677256	5678759	Oh, that's an interesting little house rule.
5678759	5679219	I like that.
5681050	5689234	So there are other variations of the game that have different board sizes and game pieces and rules and stuff like that.
5689234	5700960	The variations are really good for, again, folks who use AI for projections and game theorists.
5701600	5707641	So, the most common board is 7 columns by 6 rows.
5707641	5716343	Variations can be 5 by 4, 6 by 5, 8 by 7, 9 by 7, 10 by 7, 8 by 8, and infinite connect 4.
5716343	5723405	And then cylinder infinite connect 4, which I haven't seen either of those.
5723405	5723705	So...
5725640	5731541	Basically, though, you're pretty much going, you know, just drop it in, see what happens.
5731541	5736502	So, there are other variations, like I was saying.
5736502	5753505	Pop out starts traditionally the same way, but you alternate your pieces, everyone takes their turn, but during each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top, or if one has any discs of their own color on the bottom row, they can pop out.
5754405	5756586	that disc instead.
5756586	5762548	And so it drops down everything from above it, you know, kind of like clearing out a Tetris line.
5762548	5774032	They also pop ten, which you set up your discs into the slot, filling up from only the bottom row and then moving on until the next row is filled.
5774032	5776853	So you're you're doing your four like that.
5776853	5781695	There's also five in a row, of course, played on a six by nine grid.
5783170	5785358	Power Up, which is
5787615	5794860	They have a power checkers piece where you can choose to play it once per game and it has an anvil icon.
5794860	5800323	If you play one with an anvil icon, you have to pop out all the pieces below it.
5800323	5803365	Just different variations like that.
5803365	5811690	So as far as other versions of the game, there's a giant Kinect 4 and we actually see someone who has constructed one.
5814552	5819094	Yeah, this is the largest version.
5819094	5825797	It has made from weather-resistant wood and measures 120 cm in both width and height.
5825797	5832460	It was released for the Microvision video game console in 1997, developed by Robert Hoffberg.
5832460	5836401	And it was also released on the TI-99-4 computer.
5836401	5837222	I have played that one.
5838623	5840605	in 1979, of course.
5840605	5844649	I was a little bit older when I played it.
5844649	5849774	It also, I mean, one of the fun things about it is that you can just play a very quick game.
5849774	5851836	There's travel versions of it.
5851836	5857381	There's also another one they made in 2007 called Connect Four Stackers, which instead of the grid,
5858822	5864505	You have a board that you're placing your discs on.
5864505	5875090	There's also a physical game called Kinect 4x4 where it has two layer vertical grid with colored discs for four players plus blocking discs.
5877012	5884967	In 2013, Baytek Games released a Kinect for Ticket Redemption arcade game under license by Hasbro.
5884967	5888013	In 2015, Winning Moves published Kinect for Twist and Turn.
5889280	5895266	where you have a game tower instead of a grid and it has five rings that twist independently.
5895266	5896747	Sounds complicated.
5896747	5906477	And then Baytech Games in 2018 released a Connect 4 arcade game called Connect 4 Hoops where you throw basketballs and then they show up as checkers on the screen.
5907615	5912617	Um, so moving, uh, a little bit, a little bit past that.
5912617	5914978	Um, oh, actually I take that back.
5914978	5925522	Um, there was Connect Four Shots released by Hasbro in 2018, where you have to bounce the colored balls onto a grid until you achieve four in a row.
5925522	5935065	So to go into some pop culture stuff, um, uh, Stuart McHoney, while working with NME, uh, started a rumor that Connect Four was invented by David Bowie.
5935850	5937191	Nope.
5937191	5944833	On The Hub's show, Friday Game Night, there is a game called Connect 4 Basketball.
5944833	5946694	So you use basketballs to play.
5946694	5957057	Nintendo did a version of this called 4 in a Row for their Tabletop Games compilation and Clubhouse Games 51 Worldwide Classics for the Switch.
5957057	5963980	And then a game, A Way Out, you can play Connect 4 as a minigame.
5963980	5964560	And there you go.
5965518	5970642	All right, your classic non-video game of the month, Kinect 4.
5970642	5972723	Great choice.
5972723	5974644	Have you ever played?
5974644	5976045	What's that?
5976045	5978547	I was just going to say, can you guess anything that's next?
5978547	5980328	Do you want to hazard a guess?
5980328	5983950	I mean, I think I've shown you the list, but no, I don't think I've seen the list.
5983950	5985311	So you have not.
5985311	5985772	No.
5985772	5986452	So, yeah.
5989994	5991455	Whatever could be happening?
5991455	5992696	Whatever could it be?
5992696	5993557	We'll find out.
5993557	5995018	We'll find out soon.
5995018	5997941	Um, a couple things, Jamie, I lost your avatar.
5997941	6001544	I don't know if it's because I was running b roll or something, but I'm getting the squares on discord.
6001544	6002645	I don't know what what's going on.
6002645	6004066	Sorry.
6004066	6005908	And what was the other thing I was gonna say?
6005908	6011773	Oh, have you the last time I played connect for was actually have you ever played the one they have the bolt?
6013103	6023151	which for those not from this town is kind of the local daddy bar, I guess, but it's pretty welcoming to all walks of life.
6023151	6028956	But they have one of those giant Kinect 4s.
6028956	6035401	That and the Jenga always makes a big thud when the game's over because they have one of those life-size Jengas out there too.
6035401	6038584	And they're always making gigantic noise when they fall apart.
6041845	6042947	Alright.
6042947	6050983	I do not know what's going on with this thing because I have it set to not put this stupid little camo thing on my window and it still does it.
6052602	6058664	Um, during that segment, somebody in chat reminded me of a big headline that we didn't have on our list tonight.
6058664	6061185	So I hope you won't mind me adding something here on the fly.
6061185	6062606	But I think this is worth bringing up.
6062606	6068348	And that is the announcement that ReadPop and the ESA have broken up.
6068348	6071269	They will not be, yeah, ReadPop and the ESA have broken up.
6071269	6073890	They will not be working on E3 next year.
6074530	6074550	E3.
6096502	6107687	I am actually legitimately surprised by this news because I thought for sure this was just, oh, ReadPop's just going to produce E3 as a fan convention like PAX or have E3 at PAX.
6107687	6112008	But even that has apparently fallen apart for whatever reason.
6112008	6122473	I wonder if the ESA is really hardheaded and that they really think they're going to get a show at the LA Convention Center again.
6122473	6122673	I am
6124328	6128189	Left to not be sure what else could be the possibility.
6128189	6137652	The ESA has said in a statement, we appreciate ReebPop's partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events.
6137652	6143053	While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry.
6143053	6145154	Let's let the crickets chirp for that one.
6145154	6152996	We are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event from format to location.
6153743	6157306	Hmm, we're going to get into physical magazine publication.
6157306	6161490	That's a winning strategy from format to location.
6161490	6163933	So E3 is going to be moving from the L.A.
6163933	6167416	Convention Center to the banquet room at Applebee's.
6167416	6178907	We are committed to our role as a convenor, convenor for the industry, convenor, and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.
6178907	6179087	Hmm.
6182039	6184561	Very interesting.
6184561	6186903	I was just curious about something when bringing this whole thing up.
6186903	6188824	So let me actually I just wanted to check out.
6188824	6190826	Yeah, I'm doing this live.
6190826	6193888	I have no idea what to expect here.
6193888	6203655	So I'm actually looking at the ESA's website right now because I'm just kind of curious, like, what are some things that the ESA has done for the industry?
6203655	6204836	OK, here we go.
6204836	6205376	In the news.
6206197	6210278	Back on August 23rd, Essential Facts Key Findings.
6210278	6211699	Okay, so they did a study.
6211699	6213499	I guess that's something neat.
6213499	6223422	And then we go back over a month before that for their last big headline, July 20th, Gaming for Everyone, Creating an Inclusive Environment for a Global Player Community.
6223422	6224563	Well, yes, I agree with that.
6224563	6225703	Games are for everyone.
6225703	6227543	But how did the ESA do that?
6227543	6228364	Let's see.
6228364	6232305	They gathered with experts, innovators, and changemakers in New York's
6232785	6234566	Games for Change Festival.
6234566	6235967	So the ESA didn't put it on.
6235967	6237007	They went somewhere else.
6237007	6240989	They showed up.
6240989	6243751	Showing up is really like the most important step, right?
6247034	6248855	The ESA is dead.
6248855	6249896	They just don't know it yet.
6249896	6250936	Don't tell them.
6250936	6252938	All right, moving on.
6252938	6259421	Let's talk about some other news that happened this week rapidly in our industry with rapid fire news.
6259421	6262943	We'll give you some more headlines faster than the ESA will.
6262943	6263724	Loki, we'll start with you.
6264862	6267804	Yes, so I am very excited about this.
6267804	6271906	It is another thing that you can get to build a console.
6271906	6282652	So this is not necessarily coming from LEGO this time, but it's Mega Bloks or... I think it... I don't know if it's Mega Bloks or Mega Construx, because they used to have the Construx license as well.
6282652	6285814	But Mega Blok, I guess, maybe they went back to that.
6285814	6290317	They have a 3 to 4... or 3 4th scale replica of the Xbox 360.
6291888	6294570	and it is a hundred and fifty dollars.
6294570	6305980	It's fourteen hundred pieces and it includes the Xbox 360 console, the controller and a replica of Halo 3, the case and everything.
6305980	6308762	The thing that bothers me the most about this is the internals.
6308762	6313866	They do show that there's like actual circuit boards and stuff on the inside.
6313866	6315808	And it does not look like an Xbox 360.
6315808	6319791	I have taken apart so many of those.
6319791	6321132	It's just they kind of
6322433	6324896	Close-ish.
6324896	6328179	It's, you know, it's imaginative.
6328179	6329200	You tried, you tried.
6329200	6338629	Like, they put some things in there, and they're like, yeah, I think a circuit board goes here, like, you know, heatsink goes here, some resistors go here, yeah, close enough.
6340491	6342853	But I mean, it still looks cool.
6342853	6345175	I don't know what everyone hates on Mega Bloks.
6345175	6348878	I mean, they've got some pretty good Pokemon builds.
6348878	6354062	I've done their, like, giant Pikachu thing that they did, and that was pretty sweet.
6354062	6359607	But yeah, it'll be out in October on the 8th, and they had pre-orders for it.
6359607	6364491	It's exclusively at Target, and it's sold out already.
6364491	6367253	But I'm in Target all the time, so I will just have to keep an eye out.
6367907	6372110	Also, I have no room for this whatsoever.
6372110	6376052	We can just add that to the queue of unbuilt crap in our house.
6376052	6384478	What is not included, though, with it is the ginormous, immense brick of a power supply that is not included with the kit.
6384478	6390001	Unfortunately, that would have bumped up the purchase price to $250, and they just weren't willing to do that.
6390001	6392483	Or a red filter so you can create your red ring of death.
6393175	6393755	I do.
6393755	6395356	Oh, yes, that too.
6395356	6396896	Yeah, it does light up.
6396896	6402957	I do like how the box, though, is the same box as the Xbox 360, which is pretty, pretty cool.
6402957	6405098	So I do like that.
6405098	6407379	And YYR says it's the original model or one of the slims.
6407379	6408119	It's the original model.
6408119	6409099	The original model.
6409099	6409399	Yeah.
6409399	6410479	Yeah.
6410479	6410799	Yeah.
6410799	6415221	So I'm pretty, you know, I did check it out.
6415221	6415661	I don't.
6415661	6416101	Yeah.
6416101	6420102	It's a little pricey, but, you know, it's not too bad for 1400 pieces.
6422420	6424621	Alright, what else?
6424621	6429262	And then, we've got more stuff coming to Nintendo Switch Online.
6429262	6435544	So this week, we got a few Game Boy, Nintendo, and Super Nintendo games.
6435544	6440866	Starting with Quest for Camelot for the Super Nintendo.
6440866	6443587	We have Kirby Star Stacker.
6444752	6456534	and on the for the NES and then also downtown Nekketsu March Super Awesome Field Day and Joy Mech Fight.
6456534	6458895	It's a Kunio game.
6458895	6461395	Yep, it is a Kunio game.
6461395	6469037	And those are as well for the Nintendo or yeah, for the NES.
6469037	6470897	All right, DarkSakura, what do you have?
6472334	6496305	So I have, um, for fans of Call to the Lamb, like myself, uh, there is our custom controllers release that are available now, um, through a, uh, a website, uh, for Captain Alex, C-P-T-N-A-L-E-X, all in word, who's selling, uh, DualSense, Xbox controllers, Joy-Con, and Pro controllers, and,
6496985	6504768	If you get one, you'll also get like with the special package, like 165 bucks for one.
6504768	6519133	But you can get a licensed custom controller, premium packaging, a two inch hard enamel spinner pin that I kind of just want the pin and a stainless steel authenticity card that is signed by Captain Alex.
6519133	6525075	And you can just go to CaptainAlex.com to see what they are.
6525075	6526076	I just want the pin.
6526076	6526436	That's all.
6528864	6532484	All right, well, you heard about it in the intro, and this is just so silly.
6532484	6533385	We have to talk about it.
6533385	6534965	But you know what?
6534965	6540306	Who doesn't love video games more than Cup Noodle and all their various collaborations they do?
6540306	6542747	I love all their collaborations.
6542747	6546468	There's no collaboration that hasn't been amazing.
6546468	6549568	Well, they know that gamers apparently love Cup Noodle.
6549568	6552669	By the way, we're not being paid for this product placement, and I feel like we ought to be.
6552669	6554530	But it was reported on CNN.
6554530	6555150	It's in the news.
6555150	6555750	We should bring it up.
6556350	6559152	The Gaming Cup Noodle is coming out in Japan.
6559152	6563736	It's not coming out here, but maybe Akuma JP is still out there can get us some.
6563736	6566558	It is coming out on September 18th in Japan.
6566558	6567859	Gaming Cup Noodle.
6567859	6571441	This is it's also a rainbow colored package that looks really cute.
6571441	6575224	I got to say it's why what makes it Gaming Cup Noodle.
6575224	6576145	It's caffeinated.
6578281	6579902	Garlic and Black Pepper Yakisoba Varieties
6601446	6608731	It's, you know, again, obviously, when this showed up in Final Fantasy 15, it was a huge hilarity.
6608731	6612113	They're just like, okay, let's let's just take we're gonna take the soup.
6612113	6615595	Let's remove the soup, put caffeine in there instead.
6615595	6618016	Now it's gamers soup, but it's not soup.
6618016	6619557	It doesn't make any sense.
6619557	6621639	But I love it because it's totally cup noodle.
6621639	6623480	It's like it makes any sense.
6623480	6626562	It's the most random fucking thing in the world that I'm here for it.
6626562	6626722	So
6627930	6629831	Alright, let's check in.
6629831	6640315	This is the type of leadership that we need for the ESA and Cup Noodle needs to run the E3 show.
6640315	6641475	It would be insane.
6641475	6642616	Like I would just love it.
6642616	6645997	We are at the point where Cup Noodle is a better run company than the ESA.
6645997	6648158	Yes.
6648158	6649399	100% cosigned.
6649399	6650019	Oh my god.
6651305	6658675	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things you can pick up with your Cup Noodle gamer variety.

6780189	6781629	Japan's got a lot going on too.
6781629	6786930	Traveling to Japan on the Nintendo Switch this week, Super Bomberman R2 comes out in Japan.
6786930	6792832	Batten Kaitos 1 and 2 HD remaster, that's pretty cool, comes out in Japan this week as well on the Switch.

6812799	6822022	I know we joke about a lot of collector edition stuff coming out in Japan, but yeah, it looks like it comes with a fake CD kind of thing.
6822022	6825504	Also just a lot of artwork, a sticker, a book, all this cute little thing.
6826295	6831538	Is that like the, the like portable systems of these that have like all the fake stuff with it too?
6831538	6833859	Or is this like some collector's edition thing?
6833859	6837261	It's just it's just all collector's edition, like stickers and things like that.
6837261	6839262	Typical.
6839262	6844265	One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is also out in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch.
6844265	6850428	Heading over to the PlayStation 5 this week that Super Bomberman R2 is also out in Japan.
6850428	6855371	And that I think Oh, no, we also get the Dead Cells gets a physical release in Japan as well.

6912311	6919595	You know, I was at Marshall's today and literally the Baby Shark music started playing over the loudspeaker and I'm like, the fuck?
6919595	6927219	Anyway, so on Switch we have Baten Kaitos 1 in 2 HD remaster.
6927219	6930241	For PlayStation we have VR Skater.
6930241	6937104	And for PlayStation and Switch we have The Many Pieces of Mr. Koo.
6937104	6937665	All right.
6937665	6938065	That's it.
6938765	6942709	We have a few more stories for you all and then we will get to the listener roundtable.
6942709	6944611	I don't know if we have emails tonight.
6944611	6945612	I forgot to look.
6945612	6945852	No.
6945852	6946213	Find out.
6946213	6946793	Nope.
6946793	6947194	All right.
6947194	6950937	But maybe we'll get a call or two and some questions from chat as well.
6950937	6953300	In just a little bit, we still have some stories starting with Loki.
6954408	6962655	Yep, so we talked a little bit about this, I think a few weeks ago, about Xbox new reporting system that they're going to have.
6962655	6969820	Now they have actually launched it initially in the US, UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.
6969820	6981429	It's going to be for reporting abusive voice chats, and it allows you to, the system is going to capture 60 second clips and save it to your console, and you have 24 hours to complete your report.
6982638	6991524	And then you can send off the offending clips to Microsoft so they can ban somebody or at least give them seven warnings, I think, is what they had originally.
6991524	6993405	Yeah, the seven strike plan or whatever it was.
6993405	6994486	Seven strike plan.
6994486	6996868	Yeah, that's some game of baseball there.
6996868	7008435	Our feature is designed so that only only you, the player, can initiate the capture of the last 60 seconds of gameplay activity that occurred for the content moderation purposes.
7008435	7009096	That says it works.
7010568	7019871	Let's see, they will not appear in your recent captures and the clips cannot be downloaded and modified or shared.
7019871	7021412	OK.
7021412	7022192	Cool.
7022192	7027474	I mean, well, I mean, if it's abusive content, then you shouldn't share it.
7027474	7027834	Right.
7027834	7027994	Right.
7027994	7028734	I would assume.
7028734	7030235	Yeah.
7030235	7034796	So I guess you got to really be on the ball, though, if it's, you know, only 60 seconds previously.
7034796	7036977	So I guess it makes sense.
7037689	7043593	I do feel like there's been a lot more companies that have been taking this sort of abuse that happens on platforms a little more seriously.
7043593	7054860	Like I've been seeing just, you know, because I've been playing a little more Overwatch lately, and I have seen people that are using the reporting features in there and you actually get the actual reports that say something happened, which is nice.
7054860	7057062	I wish other games I've played in the past would do something like that.
7057702	7058563	Thanks for watching!
7076018	7088372	Yeah, um, let's just let's just hope it leads to cleaning up some of these things that we assume to be true about Xbox Live and a place where everyone feels welcome, which is very important.
7088372	7090354	So DarkSakura.
7093637	7099399	For the game Sea of Stars, their developer Sabotage is working on some DLC.
7099399	7102080	So, of course, this is a retro RPG.
7102080	7106121	It's pretty well liked from what I understand.
7106121	7110282	But on Canada Radio, their CEO, Thierry Boulanger, I guess.
7112083	7117407	was basically saying that there's going to be some new stuff.
7117407	7130336	And there was also a blog post at the time that said, a fully fledged side adventure DLC would be called Throws of the Watchmaker and would expand even more on the world of Sea of Stars.
7130336	7130776	And there you go.
7131733	7136194	I definitely like that's one of those games that just came out in this last week was like, Oh my god, I got to get around to that too.
7136194	7137975	Yeah, I've heard a lot of good things about it.
7137975	7145137	Just you know, that it really feels like some type of spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger.
7145137	7147798	And I don't know why there's this rumor out there that I hate Chrono Trigger.
7147798	7149579	I don't.
7149579	7153560	I'm very excited to check out this game and check it out.
7153560	7154541	It looks really cool.
7154541	7158822	I've saw a little bit of streaming of it, but not at times I didn't want to spoil it for myself.
7158822	7158922	So
7161438	7164060	All right, Loki.
7164060	7164681	Yes.
7164681	7178971	So that wonderful game, Stray, about the cat wandering through a cyberpunk dystopia is apparently going to be getting a movie, an animated movie.
7178971	7185556	And they said, you know, it's called The Greatest Hope Punk Movie That's Ever Been Made.
7187826	7188627	I'm excited about it.
7188627	7191989	I think it'd be a good property to make an animated movie for.
7191989	7199634	So we'll see what ends up happening with that when it's coming.
7199634	7199814	Neat.
7202855	7209356	Yeah, um, I obviously we are seeing a lot of games get adapted into movies and TV and all that sort.
7209356	7221498	So I can't say it's too surprising, but it's kind of cool because that stray, I don't want to say it came out of nowhere, but like, I, you know, they announced it and everybody was like, Ooh, the cat game.
7221498	7223659	And everybody then kind of like jumped on board with it.
7223659	7225999	And it did, it did very well as a result.
7225999	7229600	So, um, because it delivered on being the cat game.
7229600	7231020	Uh, and I think people really had fun with it.
7231020	7231460	So it's kind of
7231680	7242595	And I didn't realize that Annapurna is actually, they have an animation studio, Annapurna Animation, that they made a Nimora or Nimona on Netflix.
7242595	7244157	So they've already done animated movies.
7244157	7247862	So now they get to use their own property for that.
7247862	7248022	Yeah.
7248960	7262234	Tigerclawchat says the title might cause confusion because there was a movie called Strays, a dog movie that's rated R. Eh, we get movies that come out with the same title sometimes, like, you know, after a few years go by, and I don't think this is something that's going to be coming out this year.
7262234	7263415	It's going to be a few years off.
7263415	7268481	They'll just put the cute cat on the poster, the little box art.
7268481	7269222	Yeah, they'll separate it.
7269222	7269442	Yeah.
7273562	7276343	and Crystal Skies points out they finished Nimona.
7276343	7277923	They didn't fully make it.
7277923	7278363	Oh, got it.
7278363	7278663	OK.
7278663	7279263	Let's do it.
7279263	7279363	OK.
7279363	7280944	Yeah.
7280944	7281904	All right.
7281904	7284785	And I think we got one more here.
7284785	7287545	And this is a little bit surprising.
7287545	7292246	This kind of came out of nowhere, but I'm having a Flappy Bird kind of moment hearing about this.
7292246	7294467	Yeah, it's not exactly.
7294467	7295027	But yeah.
7295027	7296027	OK, well, let's talk about it.
7296027	7298668	So it is the viral game Only Up.
7299288	7303312	which you may have seen played on Twitch because a lot of people have been playing it on Twitch.
7303312	7304773	It's no longer available on Steam.
7304773	7306815	It was delisted from Steam.
7306815	7314583	This game is had a lot of interesting chat around it because there's been talk about infringing assets because somebody Yeah, that's there's that
7314923	7315263	TheFNDC.com
7334516	7339040	But now the creator of the game says they need to put the game behind them due to stress.
7339040	7345026	What I need now is peace of mind and healing, says the developer SCKR Games.
7345026	7356777	There was an update on the Steam page about the decision, saying, I'm a solo developer and this game is my first experience in game dev, a game I did for creativity to test myself and where I made a lot of mistakes.
7357743	7360485	The game has kept me under a lot of stress all these months.
7360485	7361885	Now I want to put the game behind me.
7361885	7365207	And yes, the game will be available in the Steam store soon.
7365207	7367268	That's what I decided myself.
7367268	7370370	And sure enough, it is no longer available.
7370370	7372111	Don't make an NFT game.
7373080	7377342	Well, I don't necessarily think the NFT part was that big.
7377342	7379303	They weren't, like, it wasn't, that wasn't front and center.
7379303	7381064	I want to say, like, it's not in the game.
7381064	7385346	I want to say maybe the developer at one point, like, talked about it, possibly.
7385346	7388708	Like, it's one of those things that I think the headline got bigger than it actually was.
7389462	7391023	Like I would think weren't in the game.
7391023	7391283	Yeah.
7391283	7394144	I don't know if it was a lot of the infringing assets.
7394144	7395845	I know that was some contention before.
7395845	7397245	That was legit.
7397245	7397586	Yeah.
7397586	7399026	Because so I'm wondering.
7399026	7407550	Yeah, I'm wondering if it's more of like legal pressure, you know, to like, OK, let's put this.
7407550	7414213	Let's let's let's take this away so no one else can find more assets or infringe type of thing, because I'm just a solo dev.
7414213	7418655	And if I get sued, I'm going to be in trouble because I don't have a lot of money.
7419467	7423052	So Bobby points out that there was NFT iconography in the game.
7423052	7430941	So maybe there were, the dev was probably a fan of this, and probably inserted some of that into the game.
7430941	7433585	But did the game itself use NFTs?
7433585	7435067	It does not appear so.
7435067	7437750	So, um, but
7438825	7447949	All that aside, it was very popular on Twitch, and it's not often you hear about popular games where the developer just says, I'm out, and just up and leaves.
7447949	7452912	And that's kind of why I pulled in the reference to Flappy Bird, which I know is a bit of a different circumstance.
7452912	7459335	But that's another one where I think, right at the height of that game's fame, the guy said, I don't want to do this anymore.
7460422	7461182	Bye.
7461182	7462783	And that was that was it.
7462783	7465324	And by golly, he stuck to his word.
7465324	7466064	Right.
7466064	7470745	So I it's interesting to see this happen.
7470745	7473126	That's, you know, basically leaving that money on the table.
7473126	7475447	But at the same time, I get it.
7475447	7477527	It's a lot of stress when you're this one person.
7477527	7485830	Your game is under a microscope and people are talking about NFT references or, you know, the status of where certain assets came from and so forth.
7486390	7487831	or just updating your game.
7487831	7489451	Like you just don't want to do it anymore.
7489451	7492173	Like I don't want to support this game anymore.
7492173	7498996	So like I can't sit here and say I blame him, but it's like, you know, you got to put your mental health above everything else, period.
7498996	7500536	I'm always going to support that.
7500536	7510000	But it is just still so you don't often see people walk away from this level of a game with the exposure that it had for that.
7510000	7512441	And that's just kind of what makes this like surprising.
7512441	7512902	But I
7514141	7516262	I don't wish the developer any ill will for sure.
7516262	7523306	I hope he finds the piece he's looking for with this decision because that is that is a lot of money to leave behind.
7523306	7524167	So good luck to him.
7526493	7536497	Alright, anyhow, let's go to our roundtable where we will solicit any other questions y'all might have for us in our chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
7536497	7538798	Again, it's twitch.tv VOG Network.
7538798	7544640	You could also if you want to head on over to our Discord, you can hop in the green room and we'll take some calls.
7544640	7547361	I believe DarkSakura already mentioned we have no emails tonight.
7547761	7555084	but if you'd like to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLingerie.com is a great place to do it.
7555084	7564067	I will admit I did not check our Twitter this week to see if we got anything but I will take a look at that real quick just because I've been on that website less and less but
7565867	7568248	I will still take a look.
7568248	7570609	I see DarkSakura's plug for the show.
7570609	7571730	Oh, I guess I could.
7571730	7578732	I did tag OLR in this, but since it's somewhat related, talking a little bit about Starfield real quick.
7578732	7584715	One of the things I did like in Starfield was that they have some really cute little Easter eggs in some of the art.
7584715	7589457	It's very tangential to Fallout and some of the interesting things you see there.
7589457	7592558	But like I was raiding a random moon base and I saw this poster
7592958	7593999	Rely on each other.
7614380	7618184	I love those cute little like Easter eggs that are in the environment.
7618184	7629275	DarkSakura, I feel like this is something you can appreciate too when you used to do things like the Mass Affecting blog, where you know, you would go around and find all these things in the environment, like store names on the Citadel and things like that.
7629275	7630036	Yeah, yeah.
7630036	7631818	This one's Intimate Lingerie.
7631818	7634640	Yes, like that stuff like that is really funny to me.
7634640	7636482	I have a last minute story if you'd want.
7636482	7637163	Sure, let's do it.
7637963	7642447	So this comes from a I don't know.
7642447	7647192	It's I guess it's from a website, The Boy from Mexico.
7647192	7652116	It's this guy, Edward Dennis, who's talking about his book.
7652116	7659563	But in the about this Edward Dennis guy, this is artist, author, animator, game designer.
7659563	7661925	And one of the blurbs in here says
7664837	7672703	In addition to this, Edward is working with Paramount Pictures on a video adaptation of their Twin Peaks property.
7672703	7676486	Now, obviously, not a video adaptation.
7676486	7681169	I think the referencing video game is just mistyped in here.
7681169	7686953	But, could there be a Twin Peaks game coming from Paramount?
7688116	7691598	Hmm, could that have just been placeholder text or something?
7691598	7691958	I don't know.
7691958	7693698	I'm a little this.
7693698	7696560	There's a reach to me.
7696560	7700481	I mean, I would love to see some type of official Twin Peaks game.
7700481	7701402	Here's the thing.
7701402	7703683	I don't see it as something David Lynch would get into.
7704758	7708203	That's, that's where my that's the real block for my mind.
7708203	7716514	Like I don't want to, you know, just because this is just a random thing, I'm, you know, person I've never heard of, I don't want to necessarily dismiss it on that alone.
7716514	7719458	But just the concept, I feel like David Lynch would hate it.
7720545	7724246	So I unless somebody has talked him into it, which great.
7724246	7727107	I don't see this as something David Lynch would ever embrace.
7727107	7728507	I just don't.
7728507	7735949	And I mean, granted, I feel like he has ultimate control over the IP because that's why it took so long for there to be a reboot.
7735949	7741671	I suppose if Paramount own that or Showtime or whatever now, maybe they could go around him.
7741671	7746112	But I I just know if he's not involved, it's going to suck.
7748059	7749519	And that's just the fact.
7749519	7751300	So yeah.
7751300	7751520	Yeah.
7751520	7754841	Bobby Blackwell says that might be I had a phone call with them once.
7754841	7758501	And that's that's a little bit that's kind of the vibes I get from that.
7758501	7765703	You know, again, if if somebody has convinced David Lynch to make a video game, then fuck yeah, I'm here for it.
7765703	7774165	And honestly, it might be a great way to continue the story of Twin Peaks, because the reality is a lot of key actors and actresses in Twin Peaks are dying.
7774165	7775405	They're passing away.
7775405	7777146	The Log Lady is no longer with us.
7779007	7783209	One of the prominent FBI folks is no longer with us.
7783209	7784730	David Bowie passed away.
7784730	7787993	They kind of found a way around that in the return.
7787993	7793937	But video games would be a way for the universe of Twin Peaks to live on.
7794995	7803899	without having to rely on, you know, if certain people are going to be physically able or present to do a Twin Peaks continuation.
7803899	7809821	So like if somebody has been able to convince David Lynch of that, then fucking awesome.
7809821	7816023	But I just as a big fan of Twin Peaks, my big reaction is, oh, David Lynch would never go for that.
7816023	7817344	Forget it.
7817344	7819825	Like he'll have to die and it'll be his estate.
7819825	7821385	And that's going to be many years.
7821385	7821546	So.
7823646	7828628	Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Babylon 5 continued last month with an animated movie.
7828628	7831470	And that's how they cast new voices for the actors who passed.
7831470	7834571	Yeah, it's very, very similar to that concept.
7834571	7839714	So wouldn't be too unlike what happened with the Doctor Who.
7839714	7841034	Second Doctor episodes.
7841034	7842095	Yeah.
7842095	7843075	Yeah.
7843075	7845676	They had to remake them in animation.
7845676	7846737	But yeah.
7846737	7846857	Yeah.
7847911	7851533	Shane in chat says, I need more Twin Peaks media any way I can get it.
7851533	7852654	I'll take a game.
7852654	7855175	That PSX demo looked very good.
7855175	7860839	It did look good, but it didn't really look... I don't know how fun of a game it is.
7860839	7868323	I feel like the entire... and I don't want to disrespect the folks that worked hard on that, because again, as a fan, I think that's a really great fan project.
7868783	7871844	But I think that's all it's going to be is a, oh, that's neat.
7871844	7873005	Oh, look what they did there.
7873005	7874565	Oh, that's a cool reference.
7874565	7876306	Oh, I love that.
7876306	7879847	It's not going to really build on the universe.
7879847	7892472	If we're talking a legit Twin Peaks video game, I'm expecting that it is continuing the universe and the, you know, essentially mythology at this point behind Twin Peaks and continuing those stories.
7894333	7897636	I would love to have the fucking ending of The Return explained.
7897636	7908766	The wild thing about Twin Peaks The Return, if you watch all but the next to last episode, you're like, wow, they really brought this full circle.
7908766	7909747	This is incredible.
7910207	7917430	They, I mean, they do it kind of fast, but like, the way they tie it back to the very beginning is like, holy shit, this is incredible.
7917430	7920612	It's like, he really did know this was it the whole time.
7920612	7925294	And like, it took us, you know, 25 years to get here, but here we are, it was mind blowing.
7925294	7929216	And then you get one more episode, the very last episode, and you're like,
7931282	7932944	The fuck was that?
7932944	7934606	What now?
7934606	7936128	What happened?
7936128	7937450	What?
7937450	7942636	And like the way it ends, you know, very much like the original Twin Peaks series itself.
7942636	7943577	How's Annie?
7943577	7945680	Like the way this ends is just like,
7947195	7949877	that that is too much of a cliffhanger.
7949877	7952218	And yeah, Shane said that's why I need more.
7952218	7953179	Yeah, same.
7953179	7956962	I would love nothing more than another Twin Peaks season four.
7956962	7969550	But as the more and more time that passes, the less and less likely it is that it's going to happen unless they they really do change the year and have a completely different cast in there or something.
7969550	7969990	I don't know.
7969990	7971952	I don't know how they do it.
7971952	7972452	So we'll see.
7974249	7979472	Anyway, um, any other last minute stories, Loki?
7979472	7980232	Uh, no.
7980232	7981133	All right.
7981133	7987236	Well, with that, then I think we're towards the end of another episode and we will start to wrap things up.
7987236	7989417	We'll say goodbye first to DarkSakuras.
7989417	7991898	I believe you're going to do your thing.
7991898	7997621	But do you have any final thoughts or party words for us tonight?
7997621	7998522	I have a request.
7999759	8007626	If anyone is in a thrift store and they see one of the Echo Kichama Jigs, they're like these slotted spoon things.
8007626	8008707	Buy it for me, please.
8008707	8009668	I will pay for shipping.
8009668	8011189	I've been looking for one.
8011189	8012150	Interesting.
8012150	8014372	Is that a slotted spoon thing?
8014372	8016253	They're super convenient.
8016253	8019696	It's like a kind of a slotted spoon spatula sort of thing.
8019696	8023660	And it's like this holy grail of kitchen equipment because you can fry with it and do all this stuff.
8023660	8026182	And I super want one because we used to have one when I was a kid.
8027230	8027870	Interesting.
8027870	8030070	They're like a very neat spoon.
8030070	8032731	If anyone wants to know what it is, just look it up.
8032731	8033591	All right.
8033591	8035331	Well, have fun with your Dead by Daylighting tonight.
8035331	8036252	We'll see you in a little bit.
8036252	8036992	Okay.
8036992	8039412	I know that was a random one, but that's the truth.
8039412	8039892	That's the truth.
8039892	8040232	All right.
8040232	8041192	I'll see y'all later.
8041192	8041492	All right.
8041492	8041873	Take care.
8041873	8042333	Bye.
8042333	8043733	Bye-bye.
8043733	8044493	All right.
8044493	8047373	And Loki, last but not least, your final thought.
8047373	8047894	Oh, wait, no, wait.
8047894	8048214	Sorry.
8048214	8056175	Before we get to your final thought, let me say, thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio and downloading our show, whether you were here live or you were listening to us in the podcast feed.
8056598	8058458	Thank you for being here.
8058458	8059699	Tell a friend or two about the show.
8059699	8064840	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
8064840	8069421	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show, like Spotify, whatever.
8069421	8071201	That goes an awful long way as well.
8071201	8072941	We really appreciate all of that.
8072941	8083484	Also, we would really appreciate a follow for VOG Network over not just on Twitch, but on YouTube as well, as well as our social medias, both Blue Sky and Twatter.
8085812	8088795	Loki, now I'll go to your final thought.
8088795	8094420	My final thought is tomorrow at noon, Pacific and 3 p.m.
8094420	8098444	Eastern will be when I debut my finale for season two.
8098444	8099265	So look for that.
8099265	8104329	I'll be on the YouTube feed as a premiere, probably later tonight.
8104329	8109314	And it will be up on social media later tonight, probably as well.
8110896	8118022	If I remember and I don't have a meeting that bleeds into noon, which sometimes happens, I will lurk in the channel.
8119306	8119706	That's fine.
8119706	8121048	Or just watch it whenever.
8121048	8122669	Yeah, absolutely.
8122669	8123970	I'll get you get you those views.
8123970	8124791	All right.
8124791	8126713	Awesome.
8126713	8128334	Let's see my final thought tonight.
8128334	8130936	Thanks again to DragonCon for a great time.
8130936	8132918	Looking forward to TwitchCon in a few weeks.
8132918	8136401	And I guess I'm starting Baldur's Gate 3 tonight.
8136401	8140445	So I'm going to be doing some playing on my own channel tomorrow with Baldur's Gate 3 after work.
