1
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:19,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Steam turns 20, and reminded me of the era of when It and Half-Life Involves Other Works were dressed in an olive green only slightly less insulting than the Windows XP theme of the same color.

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:27,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing that color in characters again on the Steam Store homepage was pleasant, an instant voyage across 20 years of gaming history catalyzed by one color of vegetable I may have never eaten.

3
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:29,929
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the intro trip down memory lane.

4
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to reminisce and bring you the rest of the week's gaming news.

5
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:46,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:56,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again with episode number 974 of our show for tonight, September the 17th of 2023.

8
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,543
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined each and every week by my co-hosts.

9
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:02,845
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:05,867
[SPEAKER_03]: J.K., she's not here yet.

11
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:10,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rosh Hashanah, so she's not available until about 7.50 when it's dark.

12
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:13,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's going to pop in if our show goes that long.

13
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:14,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

14
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:17,436
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of news, but we also only have two of us tonight.

15
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:18,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

16
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:19,458
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play it by ear.

17
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:26,183
[SPEAKER_03]: So joining me for a lot of news, a busier news week than I would have expected here in early September.

18
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:28,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

20
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:29,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Loki, how are you?

21
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:30,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty good.

22
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:31,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good.

23
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:35,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So I noticed, you know, you've got a game playing behind you tonight.

24
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:45,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

25
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can find us at VOGnetwork.com and pretty much any social media out there VOG Network.

26
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:55,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to say, playing behind you, the video live, is Starfield.

27
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me go- Which is what I would have played last week.

28
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, did you finally get around to playing Starfield?

29
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:00,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

30
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:01,707
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

31
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,910
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I said that was the video I was going to play last week.

32
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you remember, last week I didn't have a video behind me because-

33
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:08,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I was rendering a video.

34
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:31,749
[SPEAKER_03]: The short version of what you posted earlier this week that is like your Magnus opus of videos.

35
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:32,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, yeah.

36
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:40,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically, it's a culmination of lore and it's kind of like celebrating my content creation journey, sort of.

37
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:44,400
[SPEAKER_01]: because it goes through a lot of the older SMPs that I was a part of.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,023
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cameos from every SMP.

39
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:50,566
[SPEAKER_01]: VOG Minecraft has a cameo in there for a brief part.

40
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:56,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the VOG Minecraft server in there and I was actually going to try to show it here if I could remember.

41
00:02:56,072 --> 00:03:00,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of early on in the video, but yeah, I remember seeing that and I was like, oh, it's the VOG Minecraft server.

42
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that server, the file I have is corrupted.

43
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,768
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's parts that are missing.

44
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:11,329
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a little bit further on in that.

45
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's a Collusion MC Season 2.

46
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,571
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, you can still see some of these amazing builds that you've done.

47
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we're looking at video.

48
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:26,373
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're listening on the podcast feed, and you want to see this video for yourself, well, isn't that quite the teaser and commercial for you to go check out LokiOLR's channel over

49
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:35,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a literal month to edit the whole thing together because it's basically a movie at this point.

50
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:40,320
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a live premiere of it and everybody was emotional watching it.

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I caught the last two minutes of that because I was working when it premiered, but I saw the last two minutes.

52
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:50,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Loki's chat's hella popping off.

53
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:51,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for him.

54
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:52,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was good.

55
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:53,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

56
00:03:56,467 --> 00:04:02,949
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, like everybody really thoroughly enjoyed it and they like understood why it took so long to put together.

57
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:05,610
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

58
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You have shot after shot of just like floating and flying and all of these different servers.

59
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:13,732
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like I imagine there's hundreds of shots.

60
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:14,992
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my family realm right there.

61
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:15,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

62
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:16,733
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one should be.

63
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:17,153
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

64
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,113
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the VOG server.

65
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:18,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

66
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:19,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo.

67
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:22,174
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw the Black Wolf Stadium down here in OLR.

68
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Wolf Stadium.

69
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:23,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

70
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:24,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got the, was it?

71
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,032
[SPEAKER_01]: like BobbyRules or BlackwolfRules and someone SkyDrews or something like that.

72
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:31,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute.

73
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:31,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

74
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:32,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

75
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this on the old?

76
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:33,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

77
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:42,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very sorry to the podcast folks to refer to video and all that, but I can't help but notice because I remember this on the old VOG Network server.

78
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:43,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this what you're flying by?

79
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:46,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember it got carved out and highlighted at some point.

80
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it like the crappy little dumpy home that I first built on the server?

81
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:53,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

82
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:32,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it corrupted, and so it had to regenerate itself, but... Yeah, it was enough to where I could at least film some of it in there, so... The whole premise is that I'm going... Like, I have a device that I made on Channel 64, it's like a portal that allows me to travel back in time through different servers to go to do different things.

83
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:33,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

84
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:52,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Take his head back from myself to get to the current season of Hermitcraft.

85
00:05:52,265 --> 00:06:04,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like this big old chase scene and then the antagonists, the administration start pursuing and it just keeps, it just keeps escalating going and more and more like craziness that's in there.

86
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fun.

87
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:18,294
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture in chat says, you know, something that I see a lot when you when you talk about your, you know, Minecraft and how, you know, how far down the rabbit hole you've fallen in the content creation, all that.

88
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:22,356
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture says, I would not know how to even start playing Minecraft.

89
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:24,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds crazy.

90
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:29,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Where where could where should somebody even begin if they want to get into Minecraft now here in 2023?

91
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:40,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of, like, the game does some, like, not a great job of, like, introducing you to different things.

92
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:46,617
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different, like, kind of survival series and, like, kind of talking about gameplay and stuff.

93
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:51,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, like, Waddles used to do one a while back.

94
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,101
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Pixel Riffs did kind of, like, a, you know, basics to Minecraft.

95
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:59,622
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it you kind of have to search up for.

96
00:06:59,622 --> 00:06:59,922
[SPEAKER_01]: They...

97
00:07:00,982 --> 00:07:19,576
[SPEAKER_01]: do some weird stuff with the new areas in the game like they have like part where you can learn some of the redstone stuff by going down to an ancient city which has like this unkillable monster there which I don't know why you'd put early game tutorials down in a you know like a

98
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,484
[SPEAKER_01]: a city like that, but you know, that's what they've got.

99
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:30,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, MereMuse has a gold star comment here though in our chat, twitch.tv, VOG Network, by saying, you start by punching a tree with your bare hands, correct?

100
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:31,948
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how you start.

101
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:44,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, they do, yeah, there's prompts, like somewhat, there's some prompts in the game, they'll tell you like, okay, punch a tree, create a crafting table, you know, create a pickaxe type of thing, so they will walk you through like,

102
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:48,055
[SPEAKER_01]: The first three steps or four steps and then that's it.

103
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:51,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest you kind of have to figure out as you go along.

104
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:55,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get different recipes that you can learn how to do stuff with that.

105
00:07:55,321 --> 00:08:02,927
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the intricate details of the game and stuff, there's not really a good way that they present it, unfortunately.

106
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:09,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, there's lots of other games out there besides Minecraft we'll talk about a lot tonight.

107
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: But I definitely want to make sure you got a plug for your video tonight because it also was your birthday this week.

108
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we kind of acknowledged that already on last week's show because you know, it was the next day but some folks in chat were curious.

109
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:20,952
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your birthday?

110
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I was good, I didn't really do anything.

111
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:31,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the day off to, because I was originally going to play more on our Season 3 server, so that's why I had taken the time off.

112
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:38,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to livestream that day, but it ended up that I had to like re-render my video like three times because there was different pieces.

113
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:49,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Premiere did some weird thing where it swapped out some of the audio in there because I was copying something from another project file that had some files that were named the same.

114
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:54,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because I copied certain things, it's like, I'm just gonna override your audio for this.

115
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:56,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to go through and catch that.

116
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:01,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a second time I had to chop a piece off the end that I had

117
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:06,053
[SPEAKER_01]: moved out over there when I was fixing the audio previously.

118
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:09,335
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took a few times to do all that, and I was able to, like, polish it and stuff.

119
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:16,219
[SPEAKER_01]: But finally was able to release it, like, on that Monday, you know, so we premiered it.

120
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:25,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just a lot of fun to get everybody's impression of it, because I'd shown off, like, especially the people I play with, I'd shown off, like, parts of it, but I didn't show, like, the end or anything.

121
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of parts like, what?

122
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,726
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was pretty cool.

123
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:30,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.

124
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:30,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

125
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:35,049
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's get into the gaming news from this week.

126
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:43,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as I was saying a little bit ago, you know, for being a random week in September, there is sure been a lot of news this week and some of it good, some of it not so good.

127
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:46,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to start with the biggest drama of all.

128
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what else to call this.

129
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:56,781
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just like this is a literal implosion of sorts of a big chunk of like indie and midsize developers with this.

130
00:09:56,781 --> 00:10:00,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think any of you that follow gaming news casually know what I'm talking about.

131
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:04,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what the hell happened this week?

132
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:11,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So this week, Unity decided to make the announcement that they were changing their pricing structure, basically.

133
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:14,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry, I'm going to make this super simple for those that don't know.

134
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:26,931
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know, Unity is a game building engine that powers many of the games that you've probably played at some point, including like Cult of the Lamb, even some mobile phone games like Pokemon Go, I believe, run on Unity.

135
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:29,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a Skyline, you know, like some of that.

136
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:33,774
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game engine that many of your favorite games have probably used.

137
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:34,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

138
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like Unreal Engine or something like that.

139
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:38,537
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just it's an engine that people use.

140
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:44,139
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use it because it is free or it's it's free for smaller developers.

141
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,080
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically get the free version.

142
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:54,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you make over one hundred thousand dollars in the year, then you pay them a licensing fee, which is like I think like I don't remember how much it was a month.

143
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,826
[SPEAKER_01]: But originally they were going to be, you know, doing that.

144
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:05,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, though, they've gone full corporate greed and decided, hey, you know what?

145
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:10,435
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to charge you 20 cents every time someone installs your game.

146
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,396
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 cents every time.

147
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:16,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is not good.

148
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:23,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, granted, they said that there's different monetary amounts that you have to hit in order to make that happen.

149
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:34,765
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know like for example they said 200 you have to make $200,000 in a year and within the last 12 months had 200,000 lifetime game installs.

150
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:39,007
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is though is they're also going back and retroactively

151
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:43,105
[SPEAKER_01]: They are getting rid of the Unity Plus Tier

152
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:02,951
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically charging, it's up to 20 cents per install.

153
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:08,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're personal or plus, it's 20 cents per install.

154
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:16,294
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are Unity Pro, it's like 15 cents and then it scales down depending on the number of installs that you have.

155
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:17,295
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of money.

156
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:24,577
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially if you put your game out for, say, I make a game and I put it out for you to play and it just pops off, it just goes nuts.

157
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,237
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be

158
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:30,049
[SPEAKER_01]: having to pay more money than you've made on the actual game itself.

159
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:38,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were I think there was an example of Vampire Survivor, I think, where they were charging like 99 cents for their game.

160
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:43,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they had, you know, made quite a bit of money on it, but had like millions of installs.

161
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,827
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be owing them lots and lots of money from this.

162
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:50,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, all the developers hate it.

163
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,490
[SPEAKER_01]: All the developers are just like,

164
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:53,116
[SPEAKER_01]: This is ridiculous.

165
00:12:53,116 --> 00:13:04,493
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, first off, you can't just change the agreement that we, you know, because these developers signed agreements to, you know, work with Unity, especially when they're that big.

166
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can't just change the agreement.

167
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,554
[SPEAKER_01]: without any sort of agreement from both parties.

168
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:13,996
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unilaterally what they're trying to do here.

169
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:18,719
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eroded any trust that developers have had with Unity to begin with.

170
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,941
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been lots of different protests, and we're going to kind of talk a little bit about some of that.

171
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:32,947
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what it comes down to is they're also trying to use this as a bargaining chip to try to get rid of some of their competition in the analytics space.

172
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:35,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a

173
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:42,517
[SPEAKER_01]: company, I want to say it's, I'm trying to remember the dev company was.

174
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:53,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's a competing company that does like kind of user acquisition and analytics, and they're targeting them saying, hey, you know what, if you use our service that does the same thing, maybe we can, you know, waive that fee for you.

175
00:13:53,462 --> 00:14:03,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying to unfairly attack this other company and try to basically like strong arm or blackmail people into using their services for this stuff.

176
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:10,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, yeah, there's different developers that talk about it, like, for example, make a game, game is freemium.

177
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:15,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Game makes $200,000 from in-app purchases after being installed 3 million times.

178
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I own Unity 20 cents per 2.8 million installs.

179
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:19,464
[SPEAKER_01]: $560,000.

180
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:20,064
[SPEAKER_01]: That's $360,000 more than we made.

181
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:21,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always nice.

182
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:22,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that they said that, you know,

183
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the stuff that really pissed off the developers.

184
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:41,164
[SPEAKER_01]: They are saying that they have a way to track the installs, but they can't say how they're doing it, because that's proprietary.

185
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:53,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that, you know, that even though people could uninstall and reinstall a game, you know, with a script to, like, say, target or attack a developer, you know, we'll work with you on solving that.

186
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:59,110
[SPEAKER_01]: If, you know, someone accidentally does that or does that intentionally, well, we'll try to work with you on that.

187
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:10,134
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have a game that goes on Game Pass or on PlayStation Now or something like that, you have to pay for all those installs.

188
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:12,556
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they going to do that through those third parties?

189
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:22,583
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they're going to be charging the console owners for that, like the actual Microsoft and Sony, which I got to be thinking if I'm Microsoft or Sony,

190
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:24,148
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

191
00:15:47,177 --> 00:16:03,903
[SPEAKER_03]: that what's happening right now, like if you look at Unity's Twitter account and you go over there, and this just happened like two hours ago before we went live tonight, they've actually put in a, we have heard you, we apologize for the confusion and angst, the runtime fee policy we announced on Tuesday caused.

192
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:10,426
[SPEAKER_03]: We are listening, talking to our team members, community, customers, and partners, and we will be making changes to the policy.

193
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We will share an update in a couple of days.

194
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your honest and critical feedback.

195
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:14,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too late.

196
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:15,448
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too late.

197
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:15,988
[SPEAKER_00]: it's

198
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Unity states that only 10% of their customers will be affected, making it sound less bad than it is.

199
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:44,909
[SPEAKER_03]: As of the Gaming Report 2022, Unity had 230,000 developers.

200
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:48,391
[SPEAKER_03]: That's around 23,000 developers affected by the change.

201
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:51,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of studios have posted statements about moving engines.

202
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's in addition to a post on September 12th.

203
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:56,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, we've heard your questions and feedback.

204
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Another post on September 12th.

205
00:16:58,454 --> 00:16:59,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we announced a change.

206
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,735
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to provide a few clarifying answers.

207
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:10,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and some of the things you were just talking about is that, you know, uh, I don't know some of the stuff about like, uh, good charity games and stuff they were backtracking on.

208
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:15,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, it just showed how piss poorly researched the whole thing was.

209
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,274
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also no way to tell what's a charity game and what's not a charity game.

210
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:25,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't you just say, oh, it's all for charity?

211
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:29,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how many hours is Unity spending investigating if something is charity?

212
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not thought out well.

213
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:34,043
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what this sounds like?

214
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:35,724
[SPEAKER_03]: This honest to God sounds like?

215
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:37,105
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds like one of those shh

216
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:43,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonehead CEO decisions where the CEO does something fucking stupid.

217
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll get to that.

218
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:47,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, I got that queued up, Loki.

219
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:48,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my receipts.

220
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It's queued up.

221
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,391
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get there.

222
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:55,452
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going on a journey tonight and we will be pulling over at that station.

223
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,213
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that all being said.

224
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Dammit, where was I before you got me going on that?

225
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:03,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

226
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:04,448
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're fine.

227
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:04,908
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fine.

228
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,609
[SPEAKER_03]: But um, yeah, bad decisions by CEOs.

229
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:08,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this this strikes me.

230
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:12,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So those things were like the CEO was like, we're gonna do this.

231
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it happen.

232
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fucking make it happen.

233
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:22,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Because your jobs on like, it sounds like something that the idiot CEO of Twitter, and we're gonna call it Twitter.

234
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:27,755
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't call it that Twitter belongs to the people and the people are calling it Twitter.

235
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:37,981
[SPEAKER_03]: However, somebody decided they could pay $44 billion for Twitter to make dumb shit decisions like, look, I can pick up and move the server myself.

236
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:41,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, how hard are these servers to actually move?

237
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:42,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it happen.

238
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:48,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And such hits as tell me your best employee on the team so I can fire you and promote your employee.

239
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: and who needs to pay the rent?

240
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:51,550
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to do?

241
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick us out?

242
00:18:52,730 --> 00:19:00,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to install an amazing seizure light on the top of my building across from the Senior Citizen Center, etc, etc.

243
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:08,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Just add this Unity debacle to the list of decisions by people who don't deserve to be rich.

244
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:23,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are certain things I am not allowed to say on Twitch.television, but every time I see a cartoon gif of a guillotine on Blue Sky, I'm like, you know, well, actually, there are no gifs on Blue Sky.

245
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:35,969
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I see a cartoon gif on some forum, sometimes I'm like, you know, I understand it more and more with each passing day.

246
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:36,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yeah.

247
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:48,699
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Shane in chat said, there's a dev who made a game with proceeds going to Planned Parenthood and a children's hospital and reached out for clarification on the charity aspect.

248
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:55,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Unity told them those counted as political organizations and would not count.

249
00:19:55,902 --> 00:20:01,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Open mouth insert foot.

250
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:01,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

251
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:05,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt you, Loki, but I'm getting warmed up.

252
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:06,999
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the first course.

253
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:07,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let's go out.

254
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We got we still got more coming.

255
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let's go to the kitchen and see what's cooking next.

256
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:15,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't so much a story because like it's kind of skewed.

257
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:24,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So the story was that CEO John Riccatello sold 2000 shares a week before Unity revealed its runtime.

258
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:26,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to be fair, they

259
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:34,064
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not the only one that sold shares and he's been selling shares on a regular basis up to this time.

260
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:37,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are regularly scheduled things.

261
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:45,657
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that said, an announcement like this is something that obviously you would plan in advance.

262
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:47,487
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively.

263
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you know you're going to be taking the company all year long, then why not?

264
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:58,521
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, well, it wasn't a large it was Yeah, it wasn't a large number of shares that he owned.

265
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:02,747
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, they sold off as like a point something percent of the shares.

266
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:03,648
[SPEAKER_01]: How many shares?

267
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:04,369
[SPEAKER_03]: How many shares did you say?

268
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:11,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was like a certain percentage to like point something percent of shares, but it, this was 2000 last week.

269
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:12,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

270
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And totally.

271
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:14,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I want y'all to remember that number.

272
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:15,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we're going to come.

273
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:16,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I want y'all to remember that 2000 number.

274
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:17,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we're coming back to it.

275
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:18,166
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming back to it.

276
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:18,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Write that down.

277
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:19,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

278
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:20,207
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming back to it.

279
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:20,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

280
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:24,310
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sold a total of 50,000 shares this week or year.

281
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so far and other people in the company have sold shares as well.

282
00:21:28,993 --> 00:21:31,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So the unity present president of growth.

283
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:40,143
[SPEAKER_01]: sold 37,500 shares on September 1st for $1.4 million.

284
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:48,547
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the board director who sold almost 70,000 shares August 30th for around $2.5 million.

285
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:52,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are selling shares on a regular basis, but they knew this was coming.

286
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:55,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, if they sold right before

287
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,272
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can make the argument, oh, well, it's insider trading.

288
00:21:59,272 --> 00:22:07,696
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're selling on a regular basis up to that, they could still plan their share sales around the announcements that they have coming as well.

289
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:11,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's still kind of on the fence of whether that could be insider trade or not.

290
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:17,921
[SPEAKER_01]: But to remind folks at home that may not remember John Riccatello, John Riccatello is the wonderful CEO at EA.

291
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Another fantastic company who suggested that, hey, you know what?

292
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be really cool if players had to pay to reload their guns in Battlefield.

293
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,553
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the douchebag that came up with that kind of stuff.

294
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:35,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how he may be wanting to charge per install for

295
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:37,465
[SPEAKER_01]: and

296
00:22:55,268 --> 00:23:02,570
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh or in the last week but you know it's still uh you know he's been selling shares slowly over the past year.

297
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to make the case for why John Riccatello deserves to go to trial over this and I don't I and I I actually don't think this is a wild theory like I feel like this I guess feel like there is so much negative buzz out there there are in fact people calling for blood and if this had been 15 years ago I would have said

298
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:36,244
[SPEAKER_03]: The government doesn't understand enough about this whole industry to understand that there's blood to be drawn here or the magnitude of what's going on.

299
00:23:36,244 --> 00:23:50,915
[SPEAKER_03]: However, now that the government has interfered in such things as Microsoft and Activision Blizzard and that whole thing, we've seen Mortal Kombat referenced in a Supreme Court document, I think we're at this case where politics realizes that video gaming is a serious industry.

300
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we take a quick trip back down memory lane, please?

301
00:23:54,718 --> 00:24:00,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like you all to remember the case of Martha Stewart.

302
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:01,684
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the U.S.

303
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:08,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Security and Exchange Commission, I'm just reading straight off the Wikipedia, but you know, whatever, Stewart avoided a loss of $45,000 by selling 3,928 shares.

304
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,611
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about less than twice that 2000 number, right?

305
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:18,913
[SPEAKER_03]: and

306
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:42,676
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if you look at Unity stock this week, it is currently tracking down 6%.

307
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:45,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this big dip that happened on Tuesday.

308
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,057
[SPEAKER_03]: What could this be?

309
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:47,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Or actually it was Wednesday.

310
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:48,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's some good ones too.

311
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I just saw as well.

312
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what else?

313
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what other game, um, happens to be made with Unity?

314
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:57,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Pokemon Go.

315
00:24:57,383 --> 00:24:57,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.

316
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would they would owe $126 million to you.

317
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:07,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're charging twice as much for a remote raid pass now they can afford it.

318
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:08,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them.

319
00:25:08,122 --> 00:25:09,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I did.

320
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:14,023
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Niantic is the company I feel least sorry for this whole situation.

321
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:16,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, honestly.

322
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:17,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

323
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm saying is that it is time for John Riccatello to answer to a judge.

324
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it that different from what Martha Stewart went to jail for?

325
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:32,802
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

326
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:35,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

327
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:45,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I know that this whole thing is only set to come after January 2024 and all that stuff, but I'm making the case that this straight up, he sold those shares because he gave that order and knew it was coming.

328
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:54,569
[SPEAKER_03]: and whether, you know, it was a time thing and not plant tough, tough titty said the kitty because these optics are terrible.

329
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:58,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to go in front of a fucking judge and explain yourself.

330
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Because and then this doesn't make sense.

331
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:01,994
[SPEAKER_01]: It don't add up.

332
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:06,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just pretend like for a second there that they had no idea this was coming.

333
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:10,120
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you not know that this that people wouldn't like this?

334
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just shocked.

335
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:13,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Shocked that they didn't like it.

336
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:37,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been a lot of different developers have been reaching out to their legal Teams and of course, you know finding that this none of this seems to be legal at all So it's gonna be interesting to see them even try to implement this Also, they may be liable to their shareholders since that's what they seem to be concerned about because of this bad decision and

337
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:43,743
[SPEAKER_01]: what it did to the stock, even though it wasn't a huge drop, still something.

338
00:26:43,743 --> 00:26:52,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they may be responsible for that as well.

339
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:57,105
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Unity had to cancel a town hall.

340
00:26:57,105 --> 00:27:00,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you saw that because there were legitimate death threats that were made.

341
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:00,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

342
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:05,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit fuzzy, like if that actually came from within Unity or not.

343
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,027
[SPEAKER_01]: It was within Unity.

344
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:06,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

345
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:08,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

346
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, please note the things I said earlier.

347
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:16,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you all understand hyperbole, because this stuff obviously crosses a very serious line in the real world.

348
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:18,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you don't make these types of threats.

349
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, legal threats?

350
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for that.

351
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:22,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Legal threats?

352
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:23,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.

353
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: This is obviously a line far crossed, but, I mean, it still shows, like, the far-reaching implications of a decision like this.

354
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:36,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for somebody at Unity, and not that I'm excusing it,

355
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,343
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously they felt like it was over and they were going to do something drastic as a result.

356
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:51,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm excusing it, but I'm just trying to evaluate how did we get this far to this point at this time?

357
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:51,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Wild.

358
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:53,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

359
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:58,974
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, though, I think that ship has sailed and they're going to try to walk it back.

360
00:27:58,974 --> 00:27:59,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I think

361
00:28:01,787 --> 00:28:15,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that is because being that they're willing to make these types of changes without consulting the people actually using the service and working with developers, I just think it's too much for a lot of people.

362
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:27,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, yeah, a lot of developers don't want to lose that skill set that they've learned going forward, but certainly it's good to give them pause to any more

363
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:37,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Games or whatever being developed with the platform like I think it's just they're really gonna look at porting stuff over I mean hell You know the folks with cold lamb.

364
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:41,107
[SPEAKER_01]: There's him like yeah, we're gonna delete the game on January 1st.

365
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:41,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah

366
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:49,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And no matter how much they dial back this decision at this point, like you said, the trust is gone.

367
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: The trust is evaporated.

368
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:53,357
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't know.

369
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,098
[SPEAKER_03]: People now know.

370
00:28:55,098 --> 00:29:03,163
[SPEAKER_03]: The ass and hole at Unity have been shown, with the pants pulled down, what is motivating the decisions at Unity.

371
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:03,944
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.

372
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:07,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It has now all exposed.

373
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all hanging out.

374
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So now any developer working with you- They also tried like removing like some stuff on their end user license agreement too.

375
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:23,047
[SPEAKER_01]: They like secretly back in April removed certain verbiage on there as well to try to allow them to do this, which is shady as well.

376
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:23,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

377
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,270
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good.

378
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:35,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I feel bad for the current students who have spent the last few years getting skills in Unity hoping to get a job in the game industry, only to find now that many devs are going to be going to a different engine.

379
00:29:35,998 --> 00:29:37,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the good quote unquote news.

380
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:43,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not good news, but the good there's a lot of people in the industry that are facing that question right now.

381
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:50,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be a lot of like, you know, I'm sure there were a lot of meetings this last week about should we pivot what engine we're going.

382
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:52,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if those decisions stop.

383
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:59,132
[SPEAKER_03]: even when Unity reverses course, you know, especially when you've got an open source engine out there that looks mighty attractive right now.

384
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing.

385
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:09,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar to Twitter, slowly and slowly and slowly dying and more people picking up alternatives, whether it be Blue Sky, Mastodon, or just fucking leaving social media.

386
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's similar in some ways to that.

387
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:17,977
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to the point that Bobby was making about the students, you have all of these coders at companies

388
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:24,565
[SPEAKER_03]: who also are probably working in Unity and their skills are also going to have to be adapted.

389
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:30,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think companies are going to necessarily be closed off just because you specialized in Unity.

390
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:34,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They will have ways to help train individuals and

391
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:38,499
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a certain brain and skill set that comes with programming.

392
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:42,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I already know it's a skill set that I don't possess, and that's okay.

393
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:45,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still that.

394
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:46,982
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, there's what little hope there.

395
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:59,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But my point is, is that those students are facing the same problems that employees already in the industry, and you know, people that run their own small gaming studios are also facing.

396
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:02,529
[SPEAKER_03]: But now is the time to pivot.

397
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why Unity is fucked.

398
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

399
00:31:09,556 --> 00:31:11,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike def says video games were a mistake.

400
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:13,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, video games were a mistake.

401
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I know why you're going with that comment.

402
00:31:14,397 --> 00:31:27,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, when I play something like journey, and I'm well either either the 80s arcade version or the more modern whenever I play something like journey, whenever I play something like, I don't know, everybody's gone to the rapture.

403
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:36,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I play a Dear Esther, whenever I play like a really artistic a game that makes a fucking point a game that has something to say, video games weren't a mistake.

404
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:44,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Video game CEOs were a mistake.

405
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Kotick was a mistake.

406
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:49,833
[SPEAKER_03]: John Riccatello was a mistake.

407
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:55,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Because where are all of these games that I'm talking about and hyping up, where are they coming from?

408
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Smaller indie studios.

409
00:31:57,938 --> 00:32:04,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And for what it's worth, when these things all fall apart, it's the indies that end up rising up.

410
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:07,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see.

411
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:11,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Sturlock says I would put Lost Odyssey in that list as well.

412
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:11,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredible story.

413
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:14,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm sure I'm sure many of you have other games you would put in that list.

414
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:18,441
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's there's beautiful art out there in video games.

415
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:21,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand what possessed death to say that comment.

416
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do want to clarify.

417
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel video games were a mistake.

418
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Video game CEOs were a mistake.

419
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

420
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:33,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love the lead that Unity was hoping for was completely buried.

421
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:39,872
[SPEAKER_03]: That they were making a lot of their AI tools part of the main personal license because it was getting paid for by these new fees.

422
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:42,934
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, we're providing these tools for free.

423
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:46,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's like ChatGPT inside the app.

424
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:46,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, who cares?

425
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:52,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we don't need ChatGPT inside the app.

426
00:32:52,157 --> 00:32:54,038
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not anything, like, instrumental.

427
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:56,898
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not.

428
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:57,919
[SPEAKER_01]: It really isn't.

429
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We added AI is another boardroom buzzword that needs to die.

430
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:02,622
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny though.

431
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:04,924
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the AI inside of Unity.

432
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:09,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked it like, Hey, Unity is, you know, proposing this type of change.

433
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:13,109
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what do you think of pros or cons of that?

434
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:16,792
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally said, this is a terrible idea.

435
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,933
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't do this.

436
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I thought was funny.

437
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:22,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Good AI.

438
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:22,936
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

439
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:24,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on this topic?

440
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:29,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, not, I mean, not really.

441
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:30,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll see how it falls out.

442
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, it's going to be busy next week.

443
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:38,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what they do to try to walk it back.

444
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,150
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I don't know if it's going to be enough.

445
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, honestly, I think it has eroded.

446
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:46,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is like the last straw because this isn't like the only thing that they've done that's been negative.

447
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:52,116
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of changes that they've made that haven't been popular with developers.

448
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:55,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this they're like, oh, hey, you know, you're going to pay us all of this money.

449
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:59,640
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, no, I don't think I will.

450
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:15,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Stirlock in chat also points out over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, like I pointed out on Bobby's show, I'm also pretty sure them not disclosing how they can tell legit from non-legit installs is a huge violation of GDPR laws in the EU.

451
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic, fabulous.

452
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,422
[SPEAKER_03]: John Riccatello has pissed off not just the American courts, but the British ones as well.

453
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:22,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's fucking go.

454
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:23,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is there.

455
00:34:23,984 --> 00:34:27,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a from Sheridan's interactive game.

456
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:32,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I misspoke because EU is sorry, because there's actually a very famous.

457
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:33,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

458
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:34,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was.

459
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:35,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm heated.

460
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cooking my brain.

461
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:47,051
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from their legal counsel, I think had proposed like some of the three, they said three things immediately come to mind as far as like legal risk.

462
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:52,513
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is an abuse of dominant position, therefore very likely to engage in unfair competition.

463
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:53,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'm into that.

464
00:34:55,085 --> 00:35:10,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Both sides of the Atlantic said it's highly likely competition in markets authority, UK, European Commission and Department of Justice US would be materially concerned about the situation and undertaking with a dominant position in the market like Unity.

465
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:14,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Making unilateral decisions, pricings, conditions, where there are provisions.

466
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:20,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Middleware, especially in mobile, is a vital component to many game businesses.

467
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:30,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they said that it might also invoke the UK and EU's platform business regulation, which governs the balance of power between platforms and businesses.

468
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:42,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so and of course, yeah, back to how is Unity going to figure out whether something is installed or not?

469
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether that's legit or not?

470
00:35:44,572 --> 00:35:48,334
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they had an algorithm that to figure that out.

471
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:59,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that they because originally it was like, okay, well, literally, literally saying AI AI's got us, they're gonna AI is gonna guess is gonna make an estimate.

472
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:00,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's

473
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it not doing an accurate count?

474
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:05,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just guessing?

475
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:07,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it phoning home?

476
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:22,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, if it's phoning home, then it's going to, you know, violate something with, I'm assured, the EU, with, you know, the GDPR or whatever, because you're sending data to some place, you know, they regulate all that.

477
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:29,271
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then once again, you know, they were like, well, there's not, we have ways of detecting pirated software.

478
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,939
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't tell you what those are.

479
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:36,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll we'll just work with you, you know, counts one, two, and three that you read there.

480
00:36:36,442 --> 00:36:38,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold his ass accountable.

481
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:40,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see Jon Rickettell in a courtroom.

482
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:42,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It is about fucking time.

483
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:47,130
[SPEAKER_03]: A CEO fucking gets gets the book thrown at him.

484
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it happens.

485
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

486
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:50,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hopefully.

487
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on to more pleasant news and talk about video games that we've been playing this week, whether they were in Unity or not.

488
00:36:57,895 --> 00:36:58,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, let's go to you.

489
00:36:58,816 --> 00:36:59,818
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

490
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:00,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And was it?

491
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:04,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you put that Minecraft video out on Monday, so surely you played something else this week.

492
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:06,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, Minecraft.

493
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:07,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I played more Minecraft this week.

494
00:37:07,984 --> 00:37:09,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not play anything else this week.

495
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:13,787
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've been trying to catch up because I still am behind even though I did have the video out.

496
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:15,268
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of season two.

497
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:16,209
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on season three.

498
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:18,230
[SPEAKER_01]: We started it almost a month ago.

499
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm trying to get my first episode done.

500
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:25,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly right now I've been designing my starter base, which

501
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:33,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you know, I've been saying, oh, hey, I'm going to, you know, let's not go so complicated and big.

502
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm totally ignoring all that.

503
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just, it's a large build.

504
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,288
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a starter base.

505
00:37:40,288 --> 00:37:43,852
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have been doing stuff on the server, so I just need to, at some point, probably at the end of this week,

506
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,281
[SPEAKER_01]: cut together a video and put it together.

507
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've got enough for about like two episodes already.

508
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:52,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just need to, you know, sit down and edit.

509
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give myself a break since it's been a month of editing.

510
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:59,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ben and then today we did the live stream day.

511
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:02,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had our first stream day of the season and that was fun.

512
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:06,317
[SPEAKER_01]: We were killing dragons all day long and doing other weird things.

513
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot of fun.

514
00:38:07,237 --> 00:38:07,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

515
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:10,605
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, my game of the week.

516
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:12,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a couple things this week.

517
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:18,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked out Baldur's Gate 3 actually finally after all this time and people talking about the game.

518
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:23,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane was like, hey, we should do like a multiplayer thing and you could stream it and we can like, you know, keep doing it every week.

519
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:25,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that actually sounds like a lot of fun.

520
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bits and pieces I've seen in Baldur's Gate 3 kind of lends itself to that.

521
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's do it.

522
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:34,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So on Monday, we streamed several hours of Baldur's Gate 3 and we started a new campaign.

523
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:35,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are

524
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:42,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see why people are really into this game because it, you know, has a very complex character creator to it.

525
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:44,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing like a Dragon Scale person.

526
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:48,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see where people who are into D&D really like this.

527
00:38:48,919 --> 00:39:01,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the roots of Baldur's Gate are in D&D, and so I'm being a little bit, you know, repetitive, but like the way it kind of plays out with how the narrator describes things down to the dice roll, like it feels like you're playing

528
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:09,471
[SPEAKER_03]: a D&D game but the computer is facilitating that and that that's really cool and I see why people are into that.

529
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:23,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little shocked and annoyed at some of the difficulty that goes in with that because so there's this part anyone who was watching my stream knows exactly what happened there was this part where we got to a church and I don't know what had happened in the story but I was like oh

530
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:28,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we need to go into this church because something had been said like we need to go in here.

531
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:32,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, there's like a little stone slab that looks kind of loose there.

532
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shane was like, Oh, you want to get rid of that stone slab?

533
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:38,515
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been very big on you're gonna make all the decisions.

534
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:38,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

535
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:40,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and he was like, here.

536
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:41,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you want to get rid of that stone slab here?

537
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go take care of that for you.

538
00:39:42,898 --> 00:39:44,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And he takes care of the stone slab.

539
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, All right, well, then I guess we're going down there.

540
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:53,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And we go down there and we are like instantly murdered by a group of high level characters.

541
00:39:53,286 --> 00:39:58,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was frustrated a lot because we hadn't saved our game in like, I don't know, 30 minutes.

542
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to go back and replay it.

543
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Shane, you fucking got us killed.

544
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:04,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, but I said, you're the one in charge.

545
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:05,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're the one that made a decision.

546
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:10,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you opened the hole and said, doesn't that look like a pretty hole?

547
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we go in it?

548
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Like,

549
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:15,124
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't use those words, that's what it felt like.

550
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:21,491
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, Shane, if you're still out there, you could have said, hey, actually, when was the last time you saved the game?

551
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:24,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you didn't have to say, you better save before we go in there.

552
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:27,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just, hey, when was the last time you saved the game?

553
00:40:27,418 --> 00:40:28,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I should do that.

554
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when we get killed, it would have been a lot less frustrating.

555
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:37,144
[SPEAKER_03]: But lesson learned the hard way, you have to save now and save often type of thing.

556
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So I won't be making that mistake again.

557
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:47,047
[SPEAKER_03]: So once we spent 30 minutes getting caught up on everything that we lost, we were able to move forward again.

558
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was it was interesting.

559
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like it's very slow going.

560
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,910
[SPEAKER_03]: But so are most D&D campaigns.

561
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, obviously, there's a lot of freedom to choose different answers.

562
00:40:56,592 --> 00:41:05,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was fucking rad that like, you can take an animal ability, like an ability to talk to animals and like the animals actually talk.

563
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, and Shane killed my cat.

564
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,942
[SPEAKER_03]: That also pissed me off.

565
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:11,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he did it because

566
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:15,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit him with something, but he deserved it.

567
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:18,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what he did, but I know he deserved it.

568
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:20,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So then he decided to kill my cat.

569
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were already weak going into this battle with the higher level characters.

570
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:25,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

571
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:55,477
[SPEAKER_03]: tune in for more adventures of us screaming at each other on Mondays until until we get to that point where I get so fucking annoyed I'm like we're not doing this again switch games because Shane has already said we're also Shane's already decided this we're also going to go back and play Pokemon Scarlet Violet because I never finished it but we're going to play a multiplayer so I can get to the DLC as well so that is also coming in the future after we finish Baldur's Gate 3 in like nine months if we're doing it once a week so

572
00:41:56,694 --> 00:42:01,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Baldur's Gate 3 fun, but annoying when it comes to the difficulty.

573
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:02,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not prepared for that.

574
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:08,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm warning all of you save after every battle save after every conversation save

575
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:13,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um, let's see other stuff that I played this week.

576
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of the same stuff.

577
00:42:15,288 --> 00:42:18,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 4, I'm still playing the season of Diablo 4.

578
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:24,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like half the internet's moved on, but I am up to like battle pass tier 87.

579
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:28,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So once I get to 90, I have finished Diablo 4 season one, essentially.

580
00:42:28,936 --> 00:42:32,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I didn't get my character to level 100, but there's nothing left to unlock.

581
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:39,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's where I'm going to kind of end Diablo 4 season one and go play something else.

582
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, also, I've been playing, you know, some mobile games.

583
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:47,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Pikmin, had a community day and I've been playing Pokemon Go.

584
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:51,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit level 46 in Pokemon Go.

585
00:42:51,325 --> 00:43:05,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And I checked out this week, which just released Monster Hunter now, which is Niantic's newest game that's in partnership with Capcom, the license holders to Monster Hunter, their logos right there on the front page.

586
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:07,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was checking the game out and I gotta say,

587
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty polished.

588
00:43:10,141 --> 00:43:13,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it was in beta for a while.

589
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:18,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not expecting a Niantic game to be that smooth on release because they never are.

590
00:43:18,243 --> 00:43:28,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if Capcom held them to a certain standard that Niantic was like, fine, I guess we got to make sure the game doesn't have bugs or, you know, every game has bugs, but you know.

591
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:31,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It plays really smooth.

592
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:36,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't randomly crash or really get a lot of frame rate skipping.

593
00:43:36,936 --> 00:43:40,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm pretty impressed at Monster Hunter now.

594
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:47,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think it's interesting that it uses the Pokestop Network, the stuff from Niantic Wayfarer, as stuff in it.

595
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,010
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's stuff that's like

596
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:56,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extra material, but like, if you don't have any near you, your progress in the game isn't really hindered.

597
00:43:56,701 --> 00:44:02,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the spawns of the monsters and random stuff in the overworld is actually very random.

598
00:44:02,886 --> 00:44:07,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they're trying to figure out a way on how to make the game fun in rural areas.

599
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:11,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though I don't live in a rural area, I think it might be working.

600
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:16,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't feel like I'm going by the parks with all the pokestops as frequently when I'm playing Monster Hunter now.

601
00:44:16,976 --> 00:44:18,978
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing about Monster Hunter now is that

602
00:44:19,912 --> 00:44:28,635
[SPEAKER_03]: like moving around and all of that, it, it doesn't seem as helpful as in other games.

603
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:33,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder how long Niantic is going to be able to put up with that because it's a direct conflict with their mission statement.

604
00:44:33,976 --> 00:44:40,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Because honestly, if you load the game every hour where you are, the environment will change and there'll be some new monsters there.

605
00:44:40,618 --> 00:44:43,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of don't have to move.

606
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's better stuff if you do move.

607
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,860
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't have to.

608
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of interesting.

609
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Shane says it still sucks in rural.

610
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:54,222
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad, but I see random stuff all over the place.

611
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:57,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's based off the XM or whatever.

612
00:44:57,602 --> 00:45:02,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane also says that Monster Hunter now is so far really decent to kind of fun.

613
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:05,884
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels more active than any of the other games from Niantic I've played.

614
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:09,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I would also say that like, honestly, um,

615
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:21,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I got into like battles like tapping it's it's very fluid and you dodge and it feels like it feels smooth like Pokemon gyms ought to be but Pokemon go is like six years old at this point.

616
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's almost like you see how far we've come at this point with the technology and everything.

617
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part is I played with friends.

618
00:45:28,253 --> 00:45:30,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually hunt together.

619
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:39,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was with some of my friends from, uh, when I was playing Ingress and all that, we were, you know, hanging out over the weekend, we went to brunch and we were like, Ooh, let's all fight a monster together.

620
00:45:39,621 --> 00:45:42,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And you scan a QR code on the phone.

621
00:45:42,183 --> 00:45:45,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And so three of us all took on a monster together.

622
00:45:45,205 --> 00:45:46,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was actually super fun.

623
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:51,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it doesn't last very long, but it was like, wow, that actually is like really fluid and kind of neat.

624
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:54,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wonder what will happen with the four and five star bosses.

625
00:45:54,992 --> 00:45:55,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

626
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:56,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

627
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:57,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's neat.

628
00:45:57,873 --> 00:46:02,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm... I will see how long it sustains itself.

629
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:11,320
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still these story quests I'm going through, and I'm probably motivated to open it at least once, maybe twice a day, so we'll see how long that holds out, but like, I don't know.

630
00:46:12,162 --> 00:46:15,183
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only there's only so many GPS games I can play at once.

631
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:22,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm kind of back into Pokemon Go even though yes, on one hand, I'm sitting here going Niantic annoys the fuck out of me.

632
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:30,150
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, I can also recognize, but I walked 10,000 steps to get today to finish four routes and get a badge in a video game.

633
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just I'm just I'm just keeping it free to play.

634
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:35,313
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's how I'm just keeping it free to play.

635
00:46:35,313 --> 00:46:37,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to spend money on anything.

636
00:46:37,314 --> 00:46:40,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I just I just don't need to spend the money.

637
00:46:42,692 --> 00:46:46,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Shane says, I wonder if the QR codes work over distance.

638
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:47,900
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't.

639
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried.

640
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:51,025
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend and I tried over telegram.

641
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:53,428
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent me a QR code and I put it on my screen.

642
00:46:53,428 --> 00:46:54,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work.

643
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do have to be somewhat close by.

644
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:00,817
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's really it for my gaming week.

645
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:04,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get into some more news.

646
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:10,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to give a plug real quick, though, to our YouTube channel over at youtube.com slash VOG Network.

647
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,581
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to talk a little bit about the Nintendo Direct that happened this week.

648
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:18,822
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a YouTube earlier this week, a little more immediate to try to get the jump on it.

649
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:29,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane and I sat down and talked a little bit about the Nintendo Direct and some impressions, but obviously I'm more than happy to repeat some of my thoughts, and things have marinated a little bit over the past couple days, so some things have shifted.

650
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:33,608
[SPEAKER_03]: But Loki, why don't you walk us through what happened with the Nintendo Direct this week?

651
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:41,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lots of different games they showed off, some we knew were coming, some we didn't know, a lot of Mario stuff.

652
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:45,597
[SPEAKER_01]: because Mario is certainly popular, especially with the movie and everything.

653
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't notice the Mario overload.

654
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:47,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that weird?

655
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:50,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just kind of expect like, of course, there's a lot of Mario games.

656
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,803
[SPEAKER_03]: There always has been.

657
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:53,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell have you all been?

658
00:47:53,384 --> 00:48:03,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, it does seem like there's been a bit of a lack in a year where we had the movie, but OK, I guess maybe, you know, COVID production slowed everything down.

659
00:48:03,493 --> 00:48:04,274
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of remakes.

660
00:48:04,274 --> 00:48:05,115
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still seeing that.

661
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:05,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

662
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:08,541
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of remakes, remasters coming out.

663
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:09,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.

664
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:11,343
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one thing.

665
00:48:11,343 --> 00:48:22,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the stuff we saw on the show off some more footage for Splatoon 3 Inkopolis and the side order expansion pass, which is going to be like a roguelike single player mode in Splatoon 3.

666
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:24,893
[SPEAKER_03]: A little better than the first tease, that's for sure.

667
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:26,149
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.

668
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:30,092
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one's like, what is this?

669
00:48:30,092 --> 00:48:34,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario versus Donkey Kong is now coming out on the Switch.

670
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:36,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was originally on the 3DS.

671
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:38,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Boy Advance, actually.

672
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:38,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Boy Advance?

673
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

674
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:41,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I actually owned it.

675
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:42,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cute game.

676
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:42,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

677
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:43,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

678
00:48:43,684 --> 00:48:44,545
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming out February 16th.

679
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:46,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they had a version of it on 3DS as well.

680
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:48,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

681
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:52,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I was thinking of Mario vs. Donkey Kong March of the Minis, I think might have been one.

682
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:57,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was like a sequel or something that was on 3DS.

683
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

684
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown.

685
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:05,456
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already seen this before, but that's been confirmed for January 18th on the Switch as well.

686
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:06,977
[SPEAKER_03]: That also looks pretty good.

687
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks very Metroidvania, Prince of Persia.

688
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:08,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm into it.

689
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:13,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Horizon Chase 2 Super Crazy Rhythm Castle November 14

690
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:32,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Konami one that like has obviously it leans on some of the very strong Konami music library, you know, things from Castlevania.

691
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:37,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could see like Bloody Tears in the screenshot, but also some Bomani songs.

692
00:49:37,597 --> 00:49:40,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it was like when I when I saw the trailer, I was like,

693
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:55,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they were always talking about how do we make pop and music appealing to a US audience, even though there are tons of people here that are into pop and music, but fine, they want to figure out a way like beat and groovy ain't fucking it.

694
00:49:55,669 --> 00:50:03,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I'm gonna I'm gonna harp on a Xbox 360 arcade game for many, many years ago, because it was that fucking bad that I still remember it.

695
00:50:03,254 --> 00:50:09,077
[SPEAKER_03]: This on the other hand, as far as like falling notes in the three or five different lanes kind of look like expanded.

696
00:50:09,077 --> 00:50:09,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, that looks kind

697
00:50:09,938 --> 00:50:16,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we had a game called the Spy X Family Anime Series, or it's based off of that, Spy X Anya Operation Memories, which is like a photo diary game.

698
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:17,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what that's about.

699
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

700
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:46,974
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some more footage of Super Mario RPG, the remake that's coming out on November.

701
00:50:46,974 --> 00:51:00,143
[SPEAKER_01]: They talked about how that there's going to be like a boss rush mode in there that kind of reminded me of the hidden battle, the hidden Final Fantasy thing, which they did show off a teaser of that, like with the door and everything.

702
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:04,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like they're going to be doing some interesting stuff with that, which is kind of cool.

703
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:08,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some new like powers, I guess.

704
00:51:09,595 --> 00:51:12,997
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can combine the three characters together and do a group attack.

705
00:51:12,997 --> 00:51:20,840
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also if you've timed your attacks well enough, then you'll hit all of the enemies, kind of an area effect attack, which is kind of neat.

706
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are like, is that going to be like really overpowering?

707
00:51:23,382 --> 00:51:24,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it rebalanced?

708
00:51:24,902 --> 00:51:26,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we kind of don't know.

709
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:34,006
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be something that you can toggle to, like that may be their way of like making it like easier, I guess, for like people coming into it.

710
00:51:34,006 --> 00:51:34,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

711
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:48,651
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, there was a trailer for another code, Recollection, which is an enhanced edition of a DS game, Trace Memory, and another code, R. That's coming out January 19th.

712
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:53,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Princess Peach Showtime, that is the Princess Peach game that they had hinted at.

713
00:51:53,873 --> 00:52:00,875
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's taking place on a stage, and she's got the Final Fantasy X-2.

714
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dressphere.

715
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:03,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Dressphere stuff, so that's kind of neat.

716
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks cool, though.

717
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:29,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like what I liked about the Princess Peach game is that it looks like it really is kind of its own universe where it's like there's these there's these new characters you haven't seen before it's a new kind of a blended art style of sorts of the 2D Mario games and maybe the Yoshi games which started as a Super Mario World 2 but anyway like I it kind of has its own unique sort of art style and I like that I like that Princess Peach is kind of getting her own universe because Luigi has Luigi's

718
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:30,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Banshee

719
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look cool.

720
00:52:56,393 --> 00:52:58,755
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming out in March on the 22nd.

721
00:52:58,755 --> 00:53:02,619
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Saga Emerald Beyond, which is releasing in 2024.

722
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:06,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, a Saga game.

723
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:10,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how excited I am.

724
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:15,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomb Raider 1, 2, and 3 are being remastered like the original Tomb Raiders, which

725
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:21,387
[SPEAKER_01]: They're slightly better looking slightly just ever so slightly.

726
00:53:21,387 --> 00:53:22,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming out.

727
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure who asked for this, but OK.

728
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:31,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's funny that you can play as the original Lara Croft sprite that is all speaking of things that have not aged well.

729
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:39,714
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's funny is that because they kind of have to follow the original sprites sort of shape, probably to do that HD remaster.

730
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:43,475
[SPEAKER_03]: The new model doesn't look great either, but it's an improvement.

731
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:52,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a new trailer for Detective Pikachu Returns that's coming out in October 6.

732
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:57,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Trombone Champ is getting its Nintendo Switch debut.

733
00:53:57,922 --> 00:54:04,505
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming to consoles and with four player local co-op and a bunch of different motion controls for it as well.

734
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:06,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And not a single Nintendo song.

735
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:06,526
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

736
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Missed Opportunity.

737
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:12,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I agree.

738
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:16,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the motion controls look silly, but the four player mode is people are going to enjoy.

739
00:54:16,725 --> 00:54:20,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of like Trombone Champ kind of feels like that joke from six months ago.

740
00:54:20,988 --> 00:54:28,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if there's still a clamoring for it, but I think the multiplayer mode, I think that'll sell some copies.

741
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:29,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

742
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:30,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Battle Crush.

743
00:54:30,193 --> 00:54:35,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a free to play online battle royale game that's coming out spring of 2024.

744
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:42,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Medieval Open World Tactical Role Playing Game War Tales Contra Operation Galuga Reimagining of Contra Arcade

745
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,221
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly looks better than that 3DS release.

746
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:16,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

747
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:33,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because Konami is not the one making them.

748
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Has something changed to Konami?

749
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:42,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, between this and some of the other things that people like, you know, we know we got Suikoden remasters that people have been asking for forever on the way.

750
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:45,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Those Castlevania collections were pretty good.

751
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:48,269
[SPEAKER_01]: The remaster of Snake Eater and stuff like that.

752
00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:54,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what it is is that they're taking their licenses and giving them the competent studios instead of trying to build them in-house.

753
00:55:54,393 --> 00:56:00,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like they listened to the advice that people were saying, like, God, I wish Konami would just give their IPs to people that can do things with them.

754
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:02,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are.

755
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:08,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that like that's happening, it's like, oh, like, actually, this all looks pretty cool.

756
00:56:08,556 --> 00:56:11,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say the Contra game looks great.

757
00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:17,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And the the Super Beat Adventure, whatever that one was called, looks really cool, too.

758
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:18,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, OK,

759
00:56:19,938 --> 00:56:23,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know I'd be praising Konami ever again on this show, but here we are.

760
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's a direction I'm kind of into.

761
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:29,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.

762
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:33,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that does come to other platforms, because I don't want to play it on Switch, but I will.

763
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:38,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play it on PC for sure.

764
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:45,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Unicorn Overlord, which is a... Oh, I'm... Let's see here.

765
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:46,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out March 8th, 2024.

766
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:54,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Unicorn Overload look nothing like the name you would expect.

767
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:57,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like a tactical look.

768
00:56:57,499 --> 00:57:01,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, like a Nobunaga ambition tactical type of thing.

769
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:06,163
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was Yeah, I don't spot any unicorns at all in this.

770
00:57:06,163 --> 00:57:08,184
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that must be the troop name or something.

771
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:10,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

772
00:57:10,224 --> 00:57:14,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Orange Ray does say that Contra is bound for PS5, Xbox and Steam.

773
00:57:14,886 --> 00:57:15,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

774
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:16,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

775
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:16,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

776
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:27,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And then back on the remake train again, but Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is getting put on the Switch as well.

777
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:28,978
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a remake of that game.

778
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:35,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Also includes the four-player co-op as well, and that's coming out summer of next year.

779
00:57:35,439 --> 00:57:45,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think this was the rumor we talked about last year, but F-Zero 99 was something that they teased or showed off, I guess, and that came out that same day.

780
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:47,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is F-Zero.

781
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:50,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

782
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:30,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, I don't know, they're saying it looks a little chaotic for me, but at the same time, I'm kind of like, oh, but they like they went in and they made the Super Nintendo version of the game like HD and widescreen, you know, and they actually had to go in and alter the tracks to make it work for like 99 people kind of all funnel into the main raceway.

783
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:33,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not too chaotic at first.

784
00:58:33,538 --> 00:58:33,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

785
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:36,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's interesting.

786
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:39,621
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sure, I'm a little sad it's not the F-Zero GX port.

787
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:41,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been begging for it for years.

788
00:58:41,062 --> 00:58:43,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe we'll get that eventually.

789
00:58:43,223 --> 00:58:48,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel an obligation to go get this to show support for F-Zero.

790
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:56,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, it's their game for the online service anyway, which I imagine most of you listening to this, if you're a Nintendo fan, you probably already have it.

791
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:57,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?

792
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Go download the game and play it a couple times.

793
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Show Nintendo.

794
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:03,695
[SPEAKER_03]: They can have more racing games than just Mario Kart.

795
00:59:03,695 --> 00:59:04,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OK.

796
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:08,118
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have two successful racing franchises.

797
00:59:08,118 --> 00:59:10,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask Xbox, Forza, Forza Horizon.

798
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It is OK to have two successful racing franchises.

799
00:59:14,864 --> 00:59:16,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

800
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:23,151
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a game called it looks like a spinoff of League of Legends, Bandle Tale, a League of Legends experience.

801
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:29,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is going to be coming out next year as well.

802
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:35,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Song of Nunu, the League of Legends story, yet another League of Legends game that is also coming out.

803
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,757
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a little bit earlier, on November 1st.

804
00:59:38,757 --> 00:59:41,299
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a new trailer for WarioWare Move It.

805
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:43,300
[SPEAKER_01]: which looks interesting.

806
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:49,383
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we knew it was kind of like another motion game before, but this one they have you doing different poses.

807
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:52,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And with those poses, you have that's how you play the games, basically.

808
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:56,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tell you like it's almost like a yoga pose that you get into, but not.

809
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you play the game like that.

810
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:01,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I love WarioWare.

811
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:03,330
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks this is terrible.

812
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't really care for smooth moves, honestly.

813
01:00:05,724 --> 01:00:09,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not into it at all.

814
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:09,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

815
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:11,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It just it looks ridiculous.

816
01:00:11,527 --> 01:00:15,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably I mean, it probably scratches the party game niche for a lot of people.

817
01:00:15,229 --> 01:00:16,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

818
01:00:16,009 --> 01:00:17,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not be buying.

819
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

820
01:00:19,471 --> 01:00:24,473
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Aya then Chronicles 100 Heroes that's out next year, April 23rd.

821
01:00:24,473 --> 01:00:26,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be buying.

822
01:00:26,594 --> 01:00:29,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I kickstarted it, so I get a copy from way back when.

823
01:00:30,613 --> 01:00:34,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastward Octopia Wargroove 2 coming out October 5th

824
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:51,272
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty exciting.

825
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:55,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave the Diver is getting a console release on October 26th.

826
01:00:55,053 --> 01:00:59,334
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great game if you haven't played it yet.

827
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:05,496
[SPEAKER_01]: They announced the final booster course pack for Mario Kart 8.

828
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:08,096
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have new characters coming as well.

829
01:01:08,096 --> 01:01:11,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Funky Kong, Pauline, Peachette.

830
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:13,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming out this holiday.

831
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:19,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Among Us is getting a new map with the Fungal, and it looks kind of fun.

832
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:28,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, last but not least, the big announcement was the remake remaster of Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door.

833
01:01:28,744 --> 01:01:29,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is coming out next year.

834
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:34,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit unexpected but cool because I that is a fun game.

835
01:01:34,761 --> 01:01:35,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

836
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:47,424
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's neat that it's I just would have thought with because those games always felt a little bit like what Super Mario RPG kind of so I kind of figured because we were getting Super Mario RPG, we weren't going to see those games for a minute.

837
01:01:47,424 --> 01:01:49,025
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we are.

838
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:54,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I hear I am bitching about two racing series, we can have two RPG series as well.

839
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:57,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just it's, it's neat.

840
01:01:57,227 --> 01:01:58,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pleasant surprise.

841
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:08,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping it would be like a collection of games like Paper Mario, Thousand Year Door and like maybe Super Paper Mario or something like that would have been kind of cool.

842
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:14,565
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, why sell you three when they can sell you three individually for three payments?

843
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:18,226
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like that's going to be the option they're going to choose, of course.

844
01:02:18,226 --> 01:02:19,887
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of the direct overall, Loki?

845
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:21,786
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all right.

846
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:22,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.

847
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:24,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there wasn't anything like I was super excited about.

848
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:31,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was all positive, though, like I didn't see anything like absolutely hated it, but it wasn't anything like, oh, my God, I got to buy that now, you know.

849
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:41,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very surprised there wasn't a Metroid Prime 2 released, because I just figured they were going to piecemeal that trilogy out, and now's a good time for Metroid Prime 2.

850
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:42,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they still might, that's true.

851
01:02:42,602 --> 01:02:48,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's still probably another direct before the end of the year, so they'll probably do another thing and they can announce that.

852
01:02:48,467 --> 01:02:55,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that came out originally around February, so maybe if they release it a year later, you know, then they could still announce that and release it.

853
01:02:57,246 --> 01:02:59,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the direct was actually pretty good.

854
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:03,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Bond Civilization VI has a stream in which Rob gives Konami some praise but has a bone to pick with Nintendo.

855
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:05,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I always have bones to pick with Nintendo.

856
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them, but, you know, we're critical of the art that we love.

857
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:14,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say overall, I thought Nintendo did do a pretty good job when you consider

858
01:03:15,552 --> 01:03:26,908
[SPEAKER_03]: If rumors are to be believed, which they probably are considering how much of this Direct leaked, because that, you know, Thousand Year Door remake leaked, F-099 leaked, which, you know, it is what it is in this industry.

859
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:34,222
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is, if you believe in those sorts of rumors, then the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming next year.

860
01:03:34,222 --> 01:03:51,516
[SPEAKER_03]: So knowing that that's coming, and if you want to believe that it's coming like a March or April, sort of like before the end of the fiscal year, enough time for them to move a bunch of them before the end of the fiscal year, then obviously they're only going to show things up to the point where that comes out, and then it's about the releases that are coming out on that system, right?

861
01:03:51,516 --> 01:03:55,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's only like so much with that looming on the horizon.

862
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were, by the way, folks,

863
01:03:57,841 --> 01:04:00,843
[SPEAKER_03]: They were never going to show the Switch 2 at this Direct.

864
01:04:00,843 --> 01:04:01,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding?

865
01:04:01,543 --> 01:04:02,024
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

866
01:04:02,024 --> 01:04:07,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they cannibalize holiday sales of the Switch?

867
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:08,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they do that?

868
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:21,175
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't... You know, rumors are rumors, but they don't want you to believe that a Switch 2 is coming, because they still want you to buy the Nintendo Switch if you've got the money and a whole... Yeah, that won't be until like a January, February, and then launch in March.

869
01:04:21,175 --> 01:04:24,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll follow the pattern of the original Switch because it worked.

870
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:28,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, um, you know, look forward to that.

871
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:35,999
[SPEAKER_03]: But considering that is all on the horizon, I think that's, you know, I think the direct was as good as it could be.

872
01:04:35,999 --> 01:04:39,402
[SPEAKER_03]: S2100mat says, maybe we'll get a little glimpse of the Game Awards.

873
01:04:39,402 --> 01:04:42,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, not till after the 25th.

874
01:04:42,204 --> 01:04:45,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be I'd be shocked, but not till after the 25th.

875
01:04:45,827 --> 01:04:51,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Awards is gonna be wild this year anyway, with all the games that have come out, you know, that race for Game of the Year is gonna be off the hook.

876
01:04:52,445 --> 01:04:57,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, so yeah, but overall, I thought the direct was was fine.

877
01:04:57,512 --> 01:05:01,398
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, especially when you consider that that's on the horizon.

878
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,600
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was good enough.

879
01:05:04,436 --> 01:05:13,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I think also I will say this, I thought one of the best things they did in that direct was at the very end before that thousand year door trailer.

880
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:20,625
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a sizzle reel of like everything they showed in that direct, but they did it by release day.

881
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they were like, here's what's coming in September.

882
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what else is coming in September.

883
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's coming October.

884
01:05:25,508 --> 01:05:26,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what else is coming.

885
01:05:26,529 --> 01:05:27,549
[SPEAKER_03]: November, November, December.

886
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:33,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they were showing about two games a month on through what March of next year or so.

887
01:05:33,173 --> 01:05:33,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So

888
01:05:34,093 --> 01:05:48,657
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely are kind of learning from what tanked them on the Wii U, is that these regular releases and the whole, you know, calendar or whatever, is a very good thing to do.

889
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:54,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And to show, you know, again, to try to move Switches during the holiday, show that it's still being regularly supported.

890
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:57,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was a very smart thing they did there at the end.

891
01:05:57,699 --> 01:06:02,400
[SPEAKER_03]: ZenMonkey11 in chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, is Switch 2 a fact?

892
01:06:03,488 --> 01:06:07,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yes, PlayStation 6 is a fact.

893
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:12,192
[SPEAKER_03]: A successor to the Xbox Series X is a fact.

894
01:06:12,192 --> 01:06:15,173
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a successor console, the Nintendo Switch.

895
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:16,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

896
01:06:16,353 --> 01:06:18,654
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a rumor is when.

897
01:06:18,654 --> 01:06:20,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rumor is that it's next year.

898
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:24,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, everything kind of tracks for that.

899
01:06:24,137 --> 01:06:29,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So this rumor is kind of a little bit more on fire than most that you hear.

900
01:06:29,059 --> 01:06:31,620
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's when you say a fact,

901
01:06:32,818 --> 01:06:36,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's release is not a fact yet, but it'll happen eventually.

902
01:06:36,805 --> 01:06:37,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Has to.

903
01:06:37,946 --> 01:06:38,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.

904
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:38,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

905
01:06:40,088 --> 01:06:41,209
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

906
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:42,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And what dumb name will they give it?

907
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:42,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

908
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get started.

909
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:46,052
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

910
01:06:46,052 --> 01:06:51,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of things that are facts, poor investment calls from Square Enix, by golly.

911
01:06:51,776 --> 01:06:52,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go again.

912
01:06:52,456 --> 01:07:03,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, according to a report from Bloomberg, so it is coming from another source, that they're apparently Final Fantasy 16 did not achieve the expected sales.

913
01:07:03,704 --> 01:07:04,965
[SPEAKER_03]: This is according to Bloomberg.

914
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:17,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Two billion of its value has now been lost due to Final Fantasy 16, which received good reviews, but did not sell at the expectation levels because we know Square Enix always puts these really high expectations of sales.

915
01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:23,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like if putting a game on one console is a bad idea.

916
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:26,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly that part, number one.

917
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:33,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate this narrative that the fucking press is running with that Final Fantasy 16 is a flop.

918
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:33,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Like,

919
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:47,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah, they either need to like, if they really thought that they were going to sell that amount, they need to forecast better because they're doing a poor job of forecasting.

920
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:54,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that was the goal is they wanted to sell that many, then maybe don't sign into exclusive deals with Sony.

921
01:07:54,300 --> 01:08:02,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's not lucrative enough for you that, you know, whatever money they're paying you to keep it one platform you could have made elsewhere.

922
01:08:05,031 --> 01:08:05,432
[SPEAKER_03]: and Will.

923
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:16,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently Forspoken, you know, that's where I'm like, this is where the two billion was lost.

924
01:08:16,573 --> 01:08:18,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't Final Fantasy 16, it was Forspoken.

925
01:08:18,634 --> 01:08:19,635
[SPEAKER_03]: That game bombed.

926
01:08:19,635 --> 01:08:20,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

927
01:08:20,275 --> 01:08:21,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it has its fans.

928
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:22,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I never played it.

929
01:08:22,757 --> 01:08:30,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't exactly motivated to spend that kind of money on a game that was, you know, getting a lukewarm reception.

930
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess maybe I'm part of the problem.

931
01:08:31,902 --> 01:08:32,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

932
01:08:32,303 --> 01:08:40,388
[SPEAKER_03]: But also of note, Square Enix has mobile games that shut down when they didn't meet the expectations, such as Bravely Default, Brilliant Lights, Echoes of Mana,

933
01:08:41,088 --> 01:08:42,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Gone.

934
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:52,316
[SPEAKER_03]: In a comment, Tokyo-based developer and gamer Michael Prefontaine said, Flooding the market with unfinished, bad, or untested games is a bad move.

935
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:58,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Listing off Marvel's Avengers or Spoken and the Diofield Chronicle as examples of these games.

936
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,383
[SPEAKER_03]: The company has overstretched itself on too many titles without proper oversight.

937
01:09:02,383 --> 01:09:04,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That I would agree with.

938
01:09:04,585 --> 01:09:05,725
[SPEAKER_03]: That I would agree with.

939
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all bombs.

940
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:10,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Marvel's Avengers

941
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:15,910
[SPEAKER_03]: In what universe should that game ever have bombed the way it did?

942
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:16,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

943
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:24,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it should have been a single player game that, you know, was the narrative single player game, like, say, the Guardians of the Galaxy game.

944
01:09:24,655 --> 01:09:31,218
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they're like, you know, what we could do is we could just say it's a live service and sell a bunch of game passes and stuff.

945
01:09:31,218 --> 01:09:33,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to make tons of money off of that.

946
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone's like, but

947
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,961
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't want to play that game.

948
01:09:36,961 --> 01:09:38,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to play this one.

949
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:52,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even then, like, you know, hey, we're going to release Chocobo Racing, except we're going to make it, you know, we're going to make it like free to play or, you know, sell you a bunch of monetizations to it that you don't want.

950
01:09:52,411 --> 01:09:52,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

951
01:09:52,571 --> 01:09:55,913
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, can I just get the full game and play that?

952
01:09:55,913 --> 01:09:55,993
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

953
01:09:56,808 --> 01:10:03,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Circan Toto, a Tokyo based industry consultant said Square Enix has problems with their games output.

954
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:05,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many of the games are kind of conventional.

955
01:10:05,612 --> 01:10:10,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Those titles get a 70% rating on Metacritic are kind of okay, and are just very forgettable.

956
01:10:10,734 --> 01:10:15,136
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, that's what's what's wild that none of that is true about Final Fantasy 16.

957
01:10:15,136 --> 01:10:15,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So why rub?

958
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:19,400
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I thought they were investing in NFTs.

959
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't that turn the company around?

960
01:10:21,122 --> 01:10:22,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was supposed to be the big thing.

961
01:10:22,663 --> 01:10:27,309
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice that conversation fucking evaporated like quick.

962
01:10:27,309 --> 01:10:34,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's a done like we're not Square Enix is smart enough to not say that word ever again.

963
01:10:34,376 --> 01:10:35,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is that.

964
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:40,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, like, you know, I feel like we have all this.

965
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:47,319
[SPEAKER_03]: But then on the other hand, Square Enix is like Theatrhythm has sold a bunch of copies, the pixel remasters have done very well.

966
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:49,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is, I don't know.

967
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,723
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also understand that Square Enix wants to be more than Final Fantasy.

968
01:10:52,723 --> 01:11:02,952
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really think they need to be looking at the mid level titles, things like Octopath Traveler, Bravely Default, give us a fucking Chrono Trigger remake already.

969
01:11:02,952 --> 01:11:03,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what?

970
01:11:04,942 --> 01:11:07,144
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a game that you know will make money?

971
01:11:07,144 --> 01:11:09,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

972
01:11:09,326 --> 01:11:11,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.

973
01:11:11,087 --> 01:11:11,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good point.

974
01:11:11,828 --> 01:11:16,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike Deftonchat calls out ChocoboGP, another turd.

975
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to sell it like a regular game and then fill it with free to play on top of that.

976
01:11:23,057 --> 01:11:27,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, that's all gone now, but ChocoboGP deserved a better release.

977
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

978
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:29,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

979
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, technically, there's a new boss at Square Enix, but we're not seeing the change yet.

980
01:11:36,987 --> 01:11:38,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

981
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:39,290
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

982
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:47,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, golly golly, as if Nintendo doing a direct wasn't enough, Sony was like, you gotta do what Nintendo does.

983
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:47,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about me.

984
01:11:49,227 --> 01:11:54,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony does what Nintendo.

985
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:57,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they do.

986
01:11:57,373 --> 01:12:04,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sony decided to go ahead and do their state of play in which they showed off a few things, some a little bit smaller.

987
01:12:04,657 --> 01:12:10,221
[SPEAKER_01]: This interests me because I am a fan of Bennett Foddy's Getting Over It game.

988
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:18,507
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, there's another frustratingly fun game to play called Baby Steps, where you control a guy's... It's almost like co-op, but not.

989
01:12:18,987 --> 01:12:34,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the control that his feet and try to traverse the minute I saw that trailer literally go to the video at VOG Network and watch what we said about this because I said this game looks fucking ridiculous I said but Loki is super gonna be into it

990
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:37,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

991
01:12:37,297 --> 01:12:38,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it looks funny.

992
01:12:38,257 --> 01:12:43,498
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is going to be coming out at some point next summer.

993
01:12:43,498 --> 01:12:50,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the announcement that Roblox is coming to PlayStation as well, which is coming to the console.

994
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:56,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also came to the MetaQuest, which my son actually wanted me to get for him on the MetaQuest.

995
01:12:56,762 --> 01:13:00,203
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it's VR, they don't let you use VR unless you're over 13.

996
01:13:00,203 --> 01:13:01,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So he could not play it.

997
01:13:02,954 --> 01:13:13,639
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I know a lot of people are like big fucking deal about Roblox on PlayStation, but Roblox is like actually extremely popular with a certain group.

998
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it is.

999
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of irritating, but it is like it is a platform where you can make a lot of different things.

1000
01:13:21,143 --> 01:13:25,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, a lot of the content is kind of trash, but it's trash that my kids play like.

1001
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:27,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally all day every day.

1002
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,545
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of content on YouTube is trash, but we all keep watching it.

1003
01:13:30,545 --> 01:13:32,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to tell you.

1004
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:34,988
[SPEAKER_01]: They find entertainment in it.

1005
01:13:34,988 --> 01:13:40,392
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally, they play a game where they DJ in like a club type thing and they like...

1006
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:44,110
[SPEAKER_01]: do that and people like tip them or something.

1007
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:44,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1008
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:44,850
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.

1009
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:50,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody told me about Total Drama Island, which is like Survivor, but it's on Roblox.

1010
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:51,735
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds awesome.

1011
01:13:51,735 --> 01:13:52,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Total Drama Island.

1012
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:53,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.

1013
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:54,617
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be just a show.

1014
01:13:56,558 --> 01:14:20,781
[SPEAKER_03]: no well you know anything's possible you know milf island from 30 rock like legit became a show like it's not called that but it's it's it's the premise of milf island which if you've never seen that parody on 30 rock funniest fucking survivor parody because it was 30 rock that show is brilliant so it's just like you know what was it janine we do not want to hit that get off of milf island it's so good

1015
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,255
[SPEAKER_01]: a show in Roblox?

1016
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, I thought it was the thing that was associated with Roblox.

1017
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,081
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds awesome, though.

1018
01:14:36,081 --> 01:14:37,941
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, whatever.

1019
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:44,282
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed off footage of Ghostbusters Rise of the Ghost Lord, which was for PlayStation VR 2.

1020
01:14:44,282 --> 01:14:47,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, they remembered that VR exists.

1021
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:51,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Also showed off the VR mode for Resident Evil 4.

1022
01:14:51,703 --> 01:14:56,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is going to be coming, I guess, September 21st.

1023
01:14:56,064 --> 01:14:59,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So just in a week here or later this week, actually.

1024
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:06,804
[SPEAKER_03]: then is yelling at me that Total Drama Island is actually a TV show that's on HBO Max.

1025
01:15:06,804 --> 01:15:15,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm crossing my wires then I swear to God there's some Roblox clone that is a survivor thing that is like drama or whatever.

1026
01:15:15,913 --> 01:15:19,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the same thing as this show.

1027
01:15:19,397 --> 01:15:22,440
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that I know about this show, I do think it's kind of funny.

1028
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'll have to add it to my list.

1029
01:15:25,376 --> 01:15:26,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a cartoon?

1030
01:15:26,877 --> 01:15:28,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a cartoon.

1031
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:29,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hold it.

1032
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Total Drama Island.

1033
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:35,626
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a show called Total Drama at one time.

1034
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:39,109
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so it's it is a show called Total Drama.

1035
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:40,390
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

1036
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:41,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Neat.

1037
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:43,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch it.

1038
01:15:43,513 --> 01:15:44,894
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an animated survivor.

1039
01:15:44,894 --> 01:15:44,994
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

1040
01:15:47,645 --> 01:15:48,545
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

1041
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:54,506
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had, uh, they showed off, uh, Avatar, the new game, Last Letter, Airbender.

1042
01:15:54,506 --> 01:15:57,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at Avatar Frontiers, the Pandora.

1043
01:15:57,507 --> 01:16:00,888
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming out in December.

1044
01:16:00,888 --> 01:16:02,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And what else?

1045
01:16:02,768 --> 01:16:08,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, even though I'm sure the game is going to be basic as fuck, like, it's a movie game.

1046
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:09,670
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ubisoft.

1047
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:10,190
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be basic.

1048
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost Riders 2 will begin in a demo at the end of October on the 26th.

1049
01:16:31,283 --> 01:16:31,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

1050
01:16:31,663 --> 01:16:32,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1051
01:16:32,324 --> 01:16:34,405
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out October 26th.

1052
01:16:34,405 --> 01:16:37,187
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting a demo before that.

1053
01:16:37,187 --> 01:16:44,391
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Deep Earth Collection, which is more colors coming to the PlayStation 5.

1054
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to have red, white, and blue.

1055
01:16:47,093 --> 01:16:50,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that's the Deep Earth Collection.

1056
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:54,818
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very patriotic of them.

1057
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not like the colors of those.

1058
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:58,260
[SPEAKER_01]: White's fine.

1059
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:59,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they already had a white console.

1060
01:17:00,865 --> 01:17:05,327
[SPEAKER_01]: But the blue and red are not, they don't look very good.

1061
01:17:05,327 --> 01:17:05,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1062
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:09,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Volcanic red, cobalt blue, and sterling silver.

1063
01:17:09,949 --> 01:17:12,731
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks white.

1064
01:17:12,731 --> 01:17:14,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not chromy enough to be silver.

1065
01:17:14,392 --> 01:17:14,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1066
01:17:14,892 --> 01:17:17,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a weird finish, but it looked pretty.

1067
01:17:17,853 --> 01:17:19,394
[SPEAKER_03]: They all look pretty, I gotta say.

1068
01:17:19,394 --> 01:17:23,956
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if I would spend money to customize this box that sits on my shelf.

1069
01:17:23,956 --> 01:17:25,437
[SPEAKER_03]: But the controllers look pretty.

1070
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:26,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1071
01:17:26,898 --> 01:17:27,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I was into it.

1072
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:31,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Helldivers 2 is going to be coming out February 8th now.

1073
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:35,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been delayed from this year.

1074
01:17:35,132 --> 01:17:42,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvel's Spider-Man 2, they showed off some trailer of that, showing off some of the open world stuff with that.

1075
01:17:42,175 --> 01:17:44,976
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks very cool.

1076
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:47,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that game is going to sell oodles and oodles.

1077
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:49,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1078
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:54,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Tales of Arise is going to be getting an expansion called Beyond the Dawn.

1079
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is coming out November 9th.

1080
01:17:58,976 --> 01:18:00,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Honkai Soul Rail

1081
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,915
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be coming out October 11th.

1082
01:18:03,915 --> 01:18:06,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that wasn't already on PlayStation, to be honest.

1083
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:06,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was.

1084
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:10,857
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of these games are just on PC and mobile and stuff.

1085
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:15,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Foam Stars, which is by Square Enix, they're getting an open beta later this month.

1086
01:18:15,459 --> 01:18:16,579
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks kind of interesting.

1087
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:17,260
[SPEAKER_03]: September 29th.

1088
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised this is a Square Enix thing, though.

1089
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:22,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a rip off of Splatoon, but sure.

1090
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:27,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, but they kind of do something like if you look at it, it's like the heroes have different abilities, kind of like Overwatch.

1091
01:18:27,543 --> 01:18:31,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an interesting little mishmash of the formula.

1092
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:31,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1093
01:18:32,557 --> 01:18:37,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally a trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is coming out February 29th.

1094
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks fantastic.

1095
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,482
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like a $350 collector's edition.

1096
01:18:42,482 --> 01:18:43,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeet.

1097
01:18:43,422 --> 01:18:45,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is ridiculous.

1098
01:18:45,664 --> 01:18:50,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly it's on two discs because you're going to need one disc to hold all those mini games.

1099
01:18:51,785 --> 01:18:55,008
[SPEAKER_03]: But Andrea Rodea is apparently at the Gold Saucer now.

1100
01:18:55,008 --> 01:19:00,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that they're finding ways to keep some of the great characters from the first part in the second part.

1101
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:02,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it looked really good.

1102
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:07,638
[SPEAKER_03]: They confirmed in a blog post that it ends with the sequence of events.

1103
01:19:08,548 --> 01:19:13,631
[SPEAKER_03]: and I forget the name of the area, but it's in the original Final Fantasy VII where Aerith dies.

1104
01:19:13,631 --> 01:19:21,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've confirmed, which I said a long time ago on this program, that is where the second game will end, with the quote-unquote Aerith death sequence.

1105
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:25,257
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't say, thank you, the Forbidden or Forgotten City.

1106
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:25,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1107
01:19:25,938 --> 01:19:28,759
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't say it ends with Aerith dying.

1108
01:19:28,759 --> 01:19:37,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe they didn't want to spoil it, but you'll notice the words they chose left it open that Aerith maybe doesn't die.

1109
01:19:41,515 --> 01:19:45,617
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's definitely there's definitely going to be a cliffhanger there.

1110
01:19:45,617 --> 01:19:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they already tried to kill.

1111
01:19:48,138 --> 01:19:53,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, if you haven't played the first game yet, you probably should, because that was the first like, what the fuck moment?

1112
01:19:53,841 --> 01:19:59,944
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was like, honestly, I was so into the plot of the first game and how they use that whole thing as a device.

1113
01:19:59,944 --> 01:20:00,805
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.

1114
01:20:00,805 --> 01:20:02,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.

1115
01:20:02,586 --> 01:20:05,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like how they said that your saves don't transfer over.

1116
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:06,748
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of weird.

1117
01:20:06,748 --> 01:20:07,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It is weird.

1118
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:10,590
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

1119
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:10,910
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1120
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:14,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you're gonna have to start from square one.

1121
01:20:14,656 --> 01:20:15,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

1122
01:20:15,257 --> 01:20:16,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1123
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Typical square fashion, I guess.

1124
01:20:18,062 --> 01:20:20,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So what'd you think of the Sony State of Play?

1125
01:20:20,245 --> 01:20:21,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not watch it.

1126
01:20:21,367 --> 01:20:21,848
[SPEAKER_01]: But oh,

1127
01:20:23,516 --> 01:20:27,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I am looking forward to watching at least the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth trailer.

1128
01:20:27,959 --> 01:20:30,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to play through VII.

1129
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I played through like the beginning of it.

1130
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never went back to it, but I need to play through it.

1131
01:20:34,322 --> 01:20:38,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can do what I did with Mass Effect and you just play them all back to back once they're all out.

1132
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:40,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess there you go.

1133
01:20:40,205 --> 01:20:43,627
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to wait for the third one to do that, but don't wait that long.

1134
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:44,708
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't want to.

1135
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:45,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

1136
01:20:46,065 --> 01:20:49,386
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see, moving right along.

1137
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:59,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about, oh, a studio that I was speaking fondly of last week was Digital Eclipse because they made that Gold Master game, The Making of Karateka, which I was speaking highly of.

1138
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:04,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a more in-depth look over on our YouTube channel, VOG Network.

1139
01:21:04,053 --> 01:21:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we got word about what Digital Eclipse's next game will be.

1140
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:11,076
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is not Gold Master series.

1141
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:13,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of surprised because this game would have been great for that.

1142
01:21:13,597 --> 01:21:13,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But

1143
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:42,096
[SPEAKER_03]: um they are they must have just not had the library of material but they are gonna make wizardry uh specifically wizardry proving grounds of the mad overlord and it is now in early access uh right now apparently uh this was uh of course one of the very first computer rpgs that they had with a feature party based play it goes back to 1981 and i thought they stopped making wizardry games after wizardry 8

1144
01:21:43,177 --> 01:21:51,831
[SPEAKER_03]: but boy when I said that in the discord server I got corrected real quick because apparently there have been wizardry games, spin-off games, and I guess wizardry is still kind of

1145
01:21:53,087 --> 01:21:57,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Big question mark in Japan, because there's been so it's interesting.

1146
01:21:57,009 --> 01:22:00,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So and apparently there's a lot of interesting issues going on with the rights and all that stuff.

1147
01:22:00,952 --> 01:22:04,794
[SPEAKER_03]: But this remake has been in development for two years.

1148
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:08,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It is built on top of the original Apple twos game code.

1149
01:22:08,636 --> 01:22:15,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a full overhaul with a modernized visual presentation, a redesign interface, and all of that, which doesn't

1150
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:22,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it doesn't really surprise me because, you know, the original Wizardry being on an Apple 2, it looks very old school.

1151
01:22:22,545 --> 01:22:30,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those of you watching on YouTube, you can see it's that whole like green monitor, old ass Apple in the computer lab type of look.

1152
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:36,474
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that they have reimagined this game, it obviously looks very rendered.

1153
01:22:36,474 --> 01:22:39,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, really it looks really cool.

1154
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:41,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool.

1155
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:43,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I think I kind of want to check it out.

1156
01:22:43,999 --> 01:22:44,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1157
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they could remake something like Dragon Quest in this but they would never get the rights.

1158
01:22:51,363 --> 01:22:53,464
[SPEAKER_03]: You think the rights to this were difficult to get?

1159
01:22:53,464 --> 01:22:54,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy oh boy.

1160
01:22:54,284 --> 01:22:59,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that mode that they're showing in the trailer where it's the original Apple game on top of the new graphics.

1161
01:22:59,787 --> 01:23:01,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's so smart.

1162
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:04,550
[SPEAKER_03]: A way to kind of respect both games.

1163
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of neat.

1164
01:23:06,511 --> 01:23:09,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonds006 says could Oregon Trail ever come to modern consoles?

1165
01:23:09,712 --> 01:23:10,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it has.

1166
01:23:11,532 --> 01:23:12,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

1167
01:23:28,797 --> 01:23:31,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, that looks, uh, it looks cool.

1168
01:23:31,398 --> 01:23:32,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to check that out.

1169
01:23:32,498 --> 01:23:33,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's in early access.

1170
01:23:33,638 --> 01:23:43,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I could check it out now if I wanted to, but there's just so many games to play, including continuing my adventures in Starfield, which I think you want to talk about, Loki.

1171
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:51,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, uh, Starfield has, of course, hit Nexus mods and, you know, you can get all sorts of mods for, you know, a typical Bethesda game.

1172
01:23:51,542 --> 01:23:54,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Which any Bethesda game you should expect, yes.

1173
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:55,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Any Bethesda game, yes.

1174
01:23:55,883 --> 01:23:57,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some thumbnails today.

1175
01:23:57,184 --> 01:23:57,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like,

1176
01:23:58,531 --> 01:24:03,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Not surprised, not surprised that that is one of the mods that's out there.

1177
01:24:03,595 --> 01:24:18,925
[SPEAKER_01]: However, because the world is filled with a lot of whiny man babies that don't like things like pronouns, someone had gone out of their way to create a mod that removes the pronouns from Starfield.

1178
01:24:18,925 --> 01:24:23,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, the folks at Nexus Mods are like, come on, what are you doing?

1179
01:24:23,769 --> 01:24:24,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, seriously.

1180
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:28,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they removed the mod and they're like, well, if you don't like it,

1181
01:24:28,886 --> 01:24:29,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye bye.

1182
01:24:29,967 --> 01:24:30,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for them.

1183
01:24:30,707 --> 01:24:34,570
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, we're not going to miss the trash that leaves this site because we did this.

1184
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, good for them.

1185
01:24:36,031 --> 01:24:38,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, props to Nexus Mod.

1186
01:24:38,132 --> 01:24:42,055
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically said it's certainly within our rights not to host content on our platform.

1187
01:24:42,055 --> 01:24:43,095
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1188
01:24:43,095 --> 01:24:47,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, First Amendment does not apply to our website.

1189
01:24:47,598 --> 01:24:48,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1190
01:24:48,499 --> 01:24:57,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that believes in diversity and inclusion and the removal of diversity while appealing to many does not promote a positive modding community.

1191
01:24:58,982 --> 01:24:59,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

1192
01:24:59,582 --> 01:25:02,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand behind that for sure.

1193
01:25:02,523 --> 01:25:03,543
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also stupid.

1194
01:25:03,543 --> 01:25:06,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's funny because- Did you hear the punchline about this mod?

1195
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:08,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a punchline about this whole thing.

1196
01:25:08,945 --> 01:25:10,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody brought it up in Discord.

1197
01:25:10,425 --> 01:25:13,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's I think it was- Oh, here's the punchline.

1198
01:25:13,086 --> 01:25:23,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently with that mod, because it's deleting that, you know, section in there, and it basically makes that flag is not set when you make your character.

1199
01:25:23,188 --> 01:25:25,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is non binary when you use that mod.

1200
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:34,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but your character is immediately non-binary and we'll use they them pronouns because you did not change your pronouns to something else.

1201
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:39,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So by using that mod, you are electing to be non-binary in that game.

1202
01:25:39,733 --> 01:25:43,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the chef's kiss part of that.

1203
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:44,934
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just fantastic.

1204
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:45,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1205
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:50,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure to go comment that on all of the YouTube videos of people that are running that mod.

1206
01:25:50,556 --> 01:25:51,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure to, you know,

1207
01:25:52,509 --> 01:25:57,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I saw the like, I mean, the video that's been going around about not do not go to their YouTubes, do not give them clicks.

1208
01:25:57,834 --> 01:25:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not deserve it.

1209
01:25:59,035 --> 01:26:01,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Striker, I said, I'm just speaking.

1210
01:26:01,237 --> 01:26:11,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say like the whole I saw the whole rant regarding that and the guy that was complaining about it.

1211
01:26:11,127 --> 01:26:15,351
[SPEAKER_01]: But then eventually, like after he got done with his brain, he's like, we're going to play the game now.

1212
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:15,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like.

1213
01:26:17,442 --> 01:26:25,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are some people, and it's always men, why are men so fragile about pronouns?

1214
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:26,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I know why.

1215
01:26:26,371 --> 01:26:27,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I know why.

1216
01:26:27,272 --> 01:26:29,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, here it is.

1217
01:26:29,214 --> 01:26:39,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have a very frank conversation, you and I. The reason why these babies hate pronouns is because it is their masculinity being questioned.

1218
01:26:41,217 --> 01:26:45,998
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's rooted in misogyny, 100%.

1219
01:26:45,998 --> 01:26:49,639
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a man who says, why do you need my pronouns?

1220
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:51,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You are practicing misogyny.

1221
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,501
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story, end of sentence, period, fact.

1222
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:55,501
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1223
01:26:55,501 --> 01:27:02,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the whole excuse for that whole thing, when, well, why do you have to ask my pronouns?

1224
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:05,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't you just know them?

1225
01:27:05,043 --> 01:27:06,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it obvious?

1226
01:27:06,484 --> 01:27:07,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you tell by looking?

1227
01:27:10,103 --> 01:27:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always the answer.

1228
01:27:12,266 --> 01:27:19,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is the subtext there is how dare you question my masculinity that I'm presenting?

1229
01:27:19,954 --> 01:27:22,037
[SPEAKER_03]: How dare you question that?

1230
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:24,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is why people dislike pronouns.

1231
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And to those people, I say,

1232
01:27:32,027 --> 01:27:34,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, DarkSakura is in chat actually.

1233
01:27:34,128 --> 01:27:37,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think she'll be joining us shortly saying the proper response.

1234
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:38,850
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't tell.

1235
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,210
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I asked.

1236
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,851
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to you want to shut a baby down.

1237
01:27:42,851 --> 01:27:44,532
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a great response to that.

1238
01:27:44,532 --> 01:27:45,532
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't tell.

1239
01:27:45,532 --> 01:27:46,573
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I asked.

1240
01:27:46,573 --> 01:27:47,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to assume.

1241
01:27:47,713 --> 01:27:49,814
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I asked.

1242
01:27:49,814 --> 01:27:52,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to be clear.

1243
01:27:52,895 --> 01:27:59,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's let's travel back to a simpler time in our next segment, shall we?

1244
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:18,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1245
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:29,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1246
01:28:29,811 --> 01:28:30,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm muted.

1247
01:28:30,832 --> 01:28:36,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just reading what DarkSakura was saying in chat saying, I flat out said, I can't tell you have ample bosoms, sir.

1248
01:28:37,952 --> 01:28:38,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1249
01:28:38,432 --> 01:28:39,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

1250
01:28:39,553 --> 01:28:40,454
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1251
01:28:40,454 --> 01:28:52,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, if you cannot tell by the b-roll that's already rolling over on our website, which those of you listening on the podcast cannot see, the classic game of the week is an old school classic.

1252
01:28:52,803 --> 01:28:54,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going old school tonight.

1253
01:28:54,184 --> 01:28:55,966
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a game called Miner 2049er.

1254
01:28:57,947 --> 01:29:03,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Miner 2049er is a platform game that was originally developed for Atari computers.

1255
01:29:03,711 --> 01:29:06,192
[SPEAKER_03]: The creator was Big Five Software.

1256
01:29:06,192 --> 01:29:12,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill Hogg was the guy that made this game originally, again, for Atari 8-bit and those platforms.

1257
01:29:12,656 --> 01:29:17,279
[SPEAKER_03]: In the game, you are playing as Bounty Bob, and you are going through multiple levels of a mine.

1258
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,822
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to traverse all of the platforms, but not hit the enemies.

1259
01:29:22,622 --> 01:29:25,363
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, here's the thing, here's the thing, and think about it.

1260
01:29:25,363 --> 01:29:30,625
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pac-Man and Donkey Kong mixed together.

1261
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:34,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the, it's two of the biggest arcade classics of the era.

1262
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:40,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man, collect all the dots, mixed with Donkey Kong, run over all the platform.

1263
01:29:40,448 --> 01:29:43,710
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's literally what Miner 2049er is.

1264
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:47,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And it comes from this long line of, it's not a clone.

1265
01:29:48,211 --> 01:29:51,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's its own kind of thing, but it gets really close.

1266
01:29:51,613 --> 01:29:55,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this game ended up getting ported everywhere.

1267
01:29:55,856 --> 01:29:58,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made for it.

1268
01:29:58,117 --> 01:30:02,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess actually first, Billhawg also had made games to the TRS-80 prior.

1269
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was the first game they needed for Atari 8-bit computers.

1270
01:30:05,842 --> 01:30:08,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on a 16 kilobyte ROM cartridge.

1271
01:30:08,964 --> 01:30:12,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more than the 8 kilobytes most Atari games of the era were using.

1272
01:30:13,267 --> 01:30:28,527
[SPEAKER_03]: The game was then ported to the TI-99 4A, IBM PC, Apple II, VIC-20, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Coleco, Super Cassette Vision, and of course, the Commodore 64, which is where I had played this game.

1273
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:32,915
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerKhanChat points out, I guess it's the best of both worlds.

1274
01:30:32,915 --> 01:30:37,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Those being two of the most influential video games, you're going to see a lot of copycat games.

1275
01:30:37,178 --> 01:30:43,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it isn't bad, and it did do like its own thing, like you'll notice this level kind of has like an elevator thing going on with it.

1276
01:30:43,202 --> 01:30:47,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it does, it's also elements of Jumpman, if you really want to be honest.

1277
01:30:47,745 --> 01:30:49,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it looks very much like Jumpman.

1278
01:30:49,665 --> 01:30:50,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It does look a lot like Jumpman.

1279
01:30:50,786 --> 01:30:53,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this might be before Jumpman.

1280
01:30:53,546 --> 01:30:56,587
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you know, all those games in this era kind of inspire each other.

1281
01:30:56,587 --> 01:31:03,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there was a sequel, an Apple II sequel, Miner 2049 or 2 from 1984.

1282
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:10,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there was Bounty Bob Strikes Back, which was on the Atari by the same creator that was released in 1985.

1283
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:16,412
[SPEAKER_03]: But by this point, Super Mario Brothers was out and everybody forgot about this game.

1284
01:31:16,412 --> 01:31:17,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't forget.

1285
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the interesting thing about this, you know, since I compare it to Donkey Kong, you know, Donkey Kong only had, I think, two boards on the home version and three boards in the arcade.

1286
01:31:29,475 --> 01:31:35,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there was the infamous Pie Factory that was only in the arcade, but like wasn't on a lot of the home versions.

1287
01:31:35,276 --> 01:31:36,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Miner2049er had 10 boards.

1288
01:31:40,056 --> 01:31:47,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the Atari 2600 port being that it was on the Atari 2600, it only had three ports, but then they did a volume two with three more ports.

1289
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:52,085
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 11 boards in the ColecoVision and so on and so on.

1290
01:31:52,085 --> 01:31:58,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, there were were variances in this game, as there were lots of games of the time.

1291
01:31:58,552 --> 01:32:03,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, anyway, the game came out in December of 1982.

1292
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:08,423
[SPEAKER_03]: The game sold well, apparently about as well as Ultima II of the same era.

1293
01:32:09,494 --> 01:32:13,076
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1983, it came out and ported for different systems.

1294
01:32:13,076 --> 01:32:20,439
[SPEAKER_03]: An old review from a magazine called InfoWorld said Minor2049er was selling like crazy.

1295
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the ColecoVision version by Microfun was the number one selling video game of its year.

1296
01:32:26,402 --> 01:32:30,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So there, I mean, there was a lot of people that were playing this, you know.

1297
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:33,345
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if you're curious to play this game today,

1298
01:32:34,285 --> 01:32:36,308
[SPEAKER_03]: The Atari 800 and Atari 2600 versions of Minor2049er are in Atari 50.

1299
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:45,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that leave me to thinking about this game?

1300
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1301
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:57,534
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's where you can play this game today if you want is in the Atari 50 collection, which of course is available on Switch, PS4, Steam, and Xbox One.

1302
01:32:57,534 --> 01:33:04,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Allgame, not to be confused with the network we used to be on, but the website Allgame, gave this four and a half stars for the Atari 5200 version.

1303
01:33:06,621 --> 01:33:09,344
[SPEAKER_03]: IGN gave it an 8 out of 10 for the mobile re-release.

1304
01:33:09,344 --> 01:33:16,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It was given an 82% by Computer & Video Games, so again, pretty well received at the time.

1305
01:33:16,412 --> 01:33:18,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Legacy of the game.

1306
01:33:18,294 --> 01:33:25,302
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of games were influenced by this, such as Manic Miner, Scraper Caper, which was kind of a re-release to that,

1307
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:32,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we talked about Bounty Bob Strikes Back and Miner 2049er too.

1308
01:33:32,195 --> 01:33:44,445
[SPEAKER_03]: In the book, A Brief History of Video Games, written in 2015 by Richard Stanton, he stated that Miner 2049er kind of contributed to the platform game popularity on systems like the ZX.

1309
01:33:44,445 --> 01:33:47,247
[SPEAKER_03]: A Game Boy version of this game came out in the early 1990s.

1310
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:51,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even realize that one, but apparently it was a poor sales performer.

1311
01:33:51,871 --> 01:33:52,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again,

1312
01:33:53,192 --> 01:33:57,776
[SPEAKER_03]: By that point, you had Mario and like Mario Land and stuff.

1313
01:33:57,776 --> 01:34:08,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And Stanton, in the book, A Brief History of Video Games, said that Miner 2049er was forgotten and that Nintendo's game made it look like a fossil.

1314
01:34:08,044 --> 01:34:12,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we here at OLR, or at least me, we didn't forget you.

1315
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:17,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So pour one out for the classic game of the week, Miner 2049er.

1316
01:34:17,291 --> 01:34:18,231
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1317
01:34:18,231 --> 01:34:20,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you ever play that game, Loki?

1318
01:34:20,693 --> 01:34:21,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever played that game.

1319
01:34:21,914 --> 01:34:22,875
[SPEAKER_03]: You've never played that game?

1320
01:34:23,068 --> 01:34:23,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1321
01:34:23,649 --> 01:34:25,110
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't remember it if I did.

1322
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:25,891
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1323
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:27,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an erased cassette of it.

1324
01:34:27,532 --> 01:34:30,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, hello, DarkSakura joining us here live on the show.

1325
01:34:30,715 --> 01:34:31,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1326
01:34:31,036 --> 01:34:31,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1327
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:33,538
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

1328
01:34:33,538 --> 01:34:34,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I am tired.

1329
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:36,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.

1330
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:47,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's a fairly serious and kind of relaxing holiday, but I've had some emotional times.

1331
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:48,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll leave it at that.

1332
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:48,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1333
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:55,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope you were I hope you were pleased with my pick in your absence for Minor2049.

1334
01:34:55,551 --> 01:34:58,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever play that game out of curiosity?

1335
01:34:58,233 --> 01:34:59,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an erased cassette of it.

1336
01:34:59,954 --> 01:35:00,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right, right.

1337
01:35:00,814 --> 01:35:01,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was erased.

1338
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:07,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks to living in Alabama and power surges.

1339
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:08,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1340
01:35:08,284 --> 01:35:11,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And how quickly things got demagnetized.

1341
01:35:11,766 --> 01:35:12,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

1342
01:35:12,947 --> 01:35:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

1343
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:16,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the old technology, but not really.

1344
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:20,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, before we before we get into some rapid fire news, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

1345
01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:30,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was the usual, you know, I played some Dead by Daylight and I played some, like, some very silly games on top of it.

1346
01:35:30,873 --> 01:35:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I played, of course, some Dreamlight Valley.

1347
01:35:35,837 --> 01:35:38,619
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is just sort of, like, my chill, cozy vibe game.

1348
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:50,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play my retro stuff just because of the High Holy Days being on, you know.

1349
01:35:50,048 --> 01:35:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to be more observant with all that.

1350
01:35:53,891 --> 01:35:59,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play some Pinball, played some Weird Al, played some Twilight Zone.

1351
01:35:59,656 --> 01:36:02,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just, you know, not much.

1352
01:36:02,198 --> 01:36:07,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been kind of an easy week, but I did do my DVD stuff.

1353
01:36:08,092 --> 01:36:09,213
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1354
01:36:09,213 --> 01:36:16,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope on the foot of coming off of the holiday, I hope your new year is excellent.

1355
01:36:16,297 --> 01:36:16,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1356
01:36:16,778 --> 01:36:18,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Shana Tova to all my Jews.

1357
01:36:18,959 --> 01:36:19,259
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1358
01:36:19,259 --> 01:36:22,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually SSJ100 Matt, I think said that earlier in chat.

1359
01:36:22,261 --> 01:36:23,162
[SPEAKER_03]: He's three hours ahead.

1360
01:36:23,162 --> 01:36:25,824
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, it's already nighttime when the show started.

1361
01:36:25,824 --> 01:36:27,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe said that earlier in chat.

1362
01:36:27,425 --> 01:36:27,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1363
01:36:28,554 --> 01:36:38,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I don't know how I never heard of this tradition, but there's a tradition to eat a brand new kind of fruit that you've never had before.

1364
01:36:38,316 --> 01:36:41,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and so I've had my first custard apple.

1365
01:36:41,037 --> 01:36:42,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's okay.

1366
01:36:42,397 --> 01:36:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it gets all the hype that people call it the king of all fruits.

1367
01:36:47,318 --> 01:36:52,459
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, I would prefer mangosteen if I was going to eat something rare.

1368
01:36:52,459 --> 01:36:52,839
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1369
01:36:52,839 --> 01:36:53,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a custard apple?

1370
01:36:53,759 --> 01:36:55,520
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I said that you said king of all fruit.

1371
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, that's me.

1372
01:36:58,965 --> 01:37:01,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I only knew about- I know people who will fight you for that, Rob.

1373
01:37:01,667 --> 01:37:02,148
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1374
01:37:02,148 --> 01:37:07,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I only knew about apple honey combos this holiday, so that's neat.

1375
01:37:07,432 --> 01:37:13,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I had- I made, like, these no-bake apple balls.

1376
01:37:13,197 --> 01:37:15,158
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to be bars, but they stuck to the pan.

1377
01:37:16,099 --> 01:37:20,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I made them with dried apples, raw honey.

1378
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:24,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not really supposed to have nuts, but I did put candied pecans in it.

1379
01:37:24,241 --> 01:37:29,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had dried cranberries and a few dates.

1380
01:37:29,983 --> 01:37:31,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were really good.

1381
01:37:31,903 --> 01:37:35,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I added too much salt because it needed the salt to offset a little bit of sweetness.

1382
01:37:35,644 --> 01:37:38,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But it had this weird duality to it that worked really well.

1383
01:37:38,865 --> 01:37:42,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had honey cake and I had apple cider doughnuts from Trader Joe's.

1384
01:37:44,272 --> 01:37:55,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we were all about the sweets, which is now... And of course Trader Joe's is awesome because they have the ranchala that's traditional for Rosh Hashanah.

1385
01:37:55,018 --> 01:38:00,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really good and very light and delicious.

1386
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:09,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's sort of like I'm doing my big reset because I need to pay a little bit more attention to myself before TwitchCon if I want to cosplay.

1387
01:38:10,537 --> 01:38:11,098
[SPEAKER_02]: and Matt.

1388
01:38:27,931 --> 01:38:37,202
[SPEAKER_03]: What people forget is that that doesn't mean I don't also like apple like I also like the apple donuts and the apple fritters and like Starbucks around this time of year.

1389
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:41,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they have pumpkin spice lattes, but they also have like an apple drink that's really good.

1390
01:38:41,046 --> 01:38:44,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So have them add apple syrup to chai.

1391
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:45,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that does sound good.

1392
01:38:45,311 --> 01:38:45,932
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty amazing.

1393
01:38:45,952 --> 01:38:47,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Apple Hill to get some apple wine

1394
01:39:07,099 --> 01:39:13,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those who don't know Apple Hill, it's a tourist trap here in Northern California, but it's great.

1395
01:39:13,245 --> 01:39:14,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like up the hill.

1396
01:39:14,086 --> 01:39:19,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the tiny apple cider donuts at this one place and you can get really good apple wine at this farmer's market.

1397
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:28,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did get a different kind of wine at Sprouts.

1398
01:39:28,483 --> 01:39:35,152
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a pomegranate wine, a wine made all of pomegranate, and pomegranate's another, you know, traditional flavor.

1399
01:39:35,152 --> 01:39:38,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got pomegranate wine, and this stuff is amazing.

1400
01:39:38,997 --> 01:39:40,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.

1401
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,520
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture in chat says, Wendy's has pumpkin spice frosties that are awesome.

1402
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,860
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the first person.

1403
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:49,061
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the first person I've heard compliment that.

1404
01:39:49,061 --> 01:39:51,101
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little too much sugar for me.

1405
01:39:51,101 --> 01:39:59,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the same answer I give to the question, have you had the ice spice drink at Dunkin Donuts, which is like literally blended donuts or whatever that whole mess is.

1406
01:39:59,483 --> 01:40:02,284
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little much sugar for me.

1407
01:40:02,284 --> 01:40:05,925
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, okay.

1408
01:40:05,925 --> 01:40:10,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have just a sip if I could, but I don't want to go to Wendy's to get just a sip of frosty.

1409
01:40:11,966 --> 01:40:15,327
[SPEAKER_02]: If I got a Frosty, it's gonna be chocolate and it's gonna be a child size.

1410
01:40:15,327 --> 01:40:17,828
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I can handle ice cream wise.

1411
01:40:17,828 --> 01:40:20,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you dip your chicken nuggets in that or is that like only a Shane thing?

1412
01:40:20,628 --> 01:40:21,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's gross.

1413
01:40:21,488 --> 01:40:24,509
[SPEAKER_03]: See that Shane was the one that was like, no, you have- No, a lot of people do.

1414
01:40:24,509 --> 01:40:25,649
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was fries.

1415
01:40:25,649 --> 01:40:27,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fries, not chicken nuggets.

1416
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:29,490
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people do it, but I don't like it.

1417
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:30,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I know.

1418
01:40:30,971 --> 01:40:34,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't like their fries or their chicken nuggets.

1419
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:37,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too much of the hot and cold sensation at once.

1420
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:41,439
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I did find when I was at the grocery store?

1421
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:43,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendy's chili.

1422
01:40:43,786 --> 01:40:44,247
[SPEAKER_02]: In the can.

1423
01:40:46,329 --> 01:40:49,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And now Cheesecake Factory is having their brown bread.

1424
01:40:49,931 --> 01:40:51,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, what are we gonna get next?

1425
01:40:51,752 --> 01:40:55,074
[SPEAKER_02]: McDonald's frozen chickie nuggies?

1426
01:40:55,074 --> 01:40:57,916
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe zucchini bites from Carl's Jr.?

1427
01:40:57,916 --> 01:40:58,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1428
01:40:58,536 --> 01:40:59,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, crisp cut fries.

1429
01:40:59,577 --> 01:41:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, alright, before I get too hungry... It's all about the zucchini.

1430
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:08,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back to some video games and travel around the world and check out some rapid fire news.

1431
01:41:08,082 --> 01:41:10,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki... I'm doing this one, Rob.

1432
01:41:10,543 --> 01:41:11,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you are gonna do this one.

1433
01:41:11,323 --> 01:41:12,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, let's go to Loki first.

1434
01:41:12,904 --> 01:41:13,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll go to you.

1435
01:41:13,585 --> 01:41:13,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1436
01:41:14,616 --> 01:41:21,178
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we have some of the games that are going to be coming as part of PlayStation Plus in September.

[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're a PlayStation Premium member, you also get more StarOcean games, including StarOcean First Departure R, StarOcean Until the End of Times, and StarOcean The Last Hope 4K and Full HD Remaster, and then Dragon's Crown Pro.

1442
01:42:12,321 --> 01:42:12,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

1443
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:16,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Still doesn't justify the 30% increase but go off.

1444
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:17,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

1445
01:42:17,703 --> 01:42:30,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course for Xbox Game Pass, you may remember that they had got rid of the games with gold now and as they're going to have a core collection as part of the Game Pass core that you're going to get access to.

1446
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:33,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Well now we know which games are going to be included with that.

1447
01:42:33,169 --> 01:42:35,190

1451
01:43:30,773 --> 01:43:31,634
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have for us tonight?

1452
01:44:00,586 --> 01:44:03,007
[SPEAKER_02]: A game I own.

1453
01:44:03,007 --> 01:44:07,710
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, this makes me really, really, really happy.

1454
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: A game I love, I was excited to get, I played the Shadow of on Dreamcast when I got it, Rainbow Cotton.

1455
01:44:14,674 --> 01:44:23,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and computers in spring 2024.

1456
01:44:23,939 --> 01:44:29,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And this game is actually the style sequel

1457
01:44:30,082 --> 01:44:32,324
[SPEAKER_02]: to a game I've done as a classic game.

1458
01:44:32,324 --> 01:44:34,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I've actually done this one before, though.

1459
01:44:34,825 --> 01:44:58,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But Panorama Cotton, which is actually a very rare Sega Mega Drive game, you know, Mega Drive, Genesis, where it is a over-the-shoulder kind of rail shooter game where you're having to shoot all the things in front of you as you go and you go through different towns and different places.

1460
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:02,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And this game is intensely cute.

1461
01:45:02,625 --> 01:45:12,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It also isn't super easy, but it's the game that forever hid the words WEEELO in my head.

1462
01:45:13,727 --> 01:45:18,951
[SPEAKER_02]: because she's addicted to this candy called Willow and she eats it until she throws up.

1463
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:25,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has her little fairy friends sort of like as options, you know, when she's going.

1464
01:45:25,256 --> 01:45:28,278
[SPEAKER_02]: She has to rescue different fairies.

1465
01:45:28,278 --> 01:45:30,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just such a cute game.

1466
01:45:30,339 --> 01:45:39,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game has been remastered, but trying to keep the same style and general appearance that

1467
01:45:42,298 --> 01:45:45,900
[SPEAKER_02]: that the original had.

1468
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:48,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really cute game.

1469
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:50,704
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dreamcast one was really excellent.

1470
01:45:50,704 --> 01:45:53,426
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've done a few extra things.

1471
01:45:53,426 --> 01:45:56,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a dedicated retro mode.

1472
01:45:56,949 --> 01:45:59,491
[SPEAKER_02]: There are enhanced controls.

1473
01:45:59,491 --> 01:46:04,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a snapback and lock-on features that have been touched up.

1474
01:46:04,955 --> 01:46:07,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Full localization, including the cutscenes.

1475
01:46:08,898 --> 01:46:21,370
[SPEAKER_02]: and different graphic enhancements like particle effects, ambient occlusion, things that you really only understand the terms for if you work in 3D rendering or are a big nerd like me.

1476
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:27,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and I was just looking it over, and it's everything that I remember Rainbow Cotton to be.

1477
01:46:27,836 --> 01:46:28,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1478
01:46:28,596 --> 01:46:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty thrilled.

1479
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:31,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1480
01:46:32,915 --> 01:46:40,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but just I will have to play it in Japanese because there better be the way she says it is so funny.

1481
01:46:40,543 --> 01:46:41,464
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1482
01:46:41,464 --> 01:46:43,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say you had something else?

1483
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:44,327
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1484
01:46:44,327 --> 01:46:44,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1485
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:45,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1486
01:46:45,028 --> 01:46:46,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I just made that up then.

1487
01:46:46,249 --> 01:46:46,650
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1488
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:53,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we will go to traveling around the world and checking out some release dates and see what is coming out in a country near you.

1489
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with the US Loki.

1490
01:46:56,149 --> 01:46:58,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we have a few things coming out.

1491
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:07,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with looks like Pokemon Sleep, which came out today, apparently, in Oceania.

1492
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:09,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, that's not helpful at all.

1493
01:47:09,074 --> 01:47:10,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1494
01:47:10,335 --> 01:47:11,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Ember Knights.

1495
01:47:11,035 --> 01:47:15,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet that's the device, the Pokemon Plus Plus or whatever that goes with Sleep.

1496
01:47:15,577 --> 01:47:15,797

[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what release that is.

1507
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:48,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I would feel like maybe the physical, but that's weird.

1508
01:47:48,592 --> 01:47:48,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

1509
01:47:48,952 --> 01:47:49,693

01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you go.

1520
01:49:08,615 --> 01:49:10,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's see you clear them.

1521
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:19,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a game that's based off of all of those mobile ads, you know, like the weird mobile games that they show you and then you go and actually try to download those games and they're not the same.

1522
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:23,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now that someone's actually made those into like a mini game type thing.

1523
01:49:23,562 --> 01:49:28,764
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's on PC and Nintendo Switch, although I've played on PC, so I don't know.

1524
01:49:28,764 --> 01:49:30,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat is asking if you're in the wrong week.

1525
01:49:32,448 --> 01:49:34,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I am in the wrong week.

1526
01:49:34,832 --> 01:49:35,994
[SPEAKER_01]: I scrolled my mouse.

1527
01:49:35,994 --> 01:49:37,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all I was gonna say.

1528
01:49:37,676 --> 01:49:39,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I played that months ago.

1529
01:49:39,018 --> 01:49:40,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, let's start over here.

1530
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:41,322
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that's coming out.

1531
01:49:41,322 --> 01:49:42,564
[SPEAKER_01]: That came out two months ago.

1532
01:49:42,564 --> 01:49:43,025

[SPEAKER_01]: I've been seeing those screenshots going around.

1539
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:25,321
[SPEAKER_01]: That is some scary models there.

1540
01:50:25,321 --> 01:50:28,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, the early access started a few days ago, but...

1541
01:50:28,723 --> 01:50:31,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already seen the whole game.

1542
01:50:31,284 --> 01:50:32,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1551
01:50:57,315 --> 01:51:01,078
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something very important about that Man Yu game, because I'm looking at it on my list too.

1552
01:51:01,078 --> 01:51:07,263
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual full name of the game is, Man Yu, defeat monsters and gain strong weapons and armor.

01:51:07,263 --> 01:51:09,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You may be defeated, but don't give up, become stronger.

1554
01:51:09,624 --> 01:51:12,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there will be a day when the heroes defeat the Devil King.

1555
01:51:12,567 --> 01:51:16,930
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the full... I don't know if they let Fiona Apple name this game, or what.

1556
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:21,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it was named by an 18th century author.

1557
01:51:21,153 --> 01:51:23,435
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is literally, like, here's the box art right here.

[SPEAKER_03]: Man Yu,

1559

[SPEAKER_03]: It's all there.

1561
01:51:28,139 --> 01:51:31,665
[SPEAKER_01]: They let someone that was an Amazon seller name the game.

1562
01:51:31,665 --> 01:51:32,786
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

1563
01:51:32,786 --> 01:51:37,193
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, that's how they named books in like the 18th and 19th centuries.

01:51:37,193 --> 01:51:38,055

1568
01:52:28,134 --> 01:52:34,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Raznor, let's try to pronounce this, Razirinia, I don't know.

1569
01:52:34,838 --> 01:52:36,779

[SPEAKER_01]: Forgotten Alchemy, The Polar Knight Liberator on iOS and Android.

01:52:42,043 --> 01:52:43,383
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's travel to Japan.

1573
01:52:43,383 --> 01:52:45,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Not nearly as many releases in Japan.

1574
01:52:45,825 --> 01:52:47,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing like a localized Mortal Kombat 1.

1575
01:52:47,906 --> 01:52:52,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that game probably can even come out there, but... The other ones have.

1576
01:52:52,909 --> 01:52:53,470
[SPEAKER_02]: The other ones have.

1577
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:56,171
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, it's not on their list, which surprised me.

1578
01:52:57,915 --> 01:53:05,522
[SPEAKER_03]: The general greater Asia region has a release in multi language, but not specifically Japan that I'm seeing, which is interesting.

1579
01:53:05,522 --> 01:53:15,390
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I do see it Oh, maybe it's because I'm only looking at the switch to maybe it's something that but for the switch, we do have Pikmin one and two gets released in Japan this week as well.

1580
01:53:15,390 --> 01:53:17,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course that is coming out.

1581
01:53:17,292 --> 01:53:24,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we go to the PlayStation five lies of P in a regular and collectors edition is released.

1582
01:53:24,398 --> 01:53:24,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1583
01:53:25,334 --> 01:53:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really, that's really it, I guess.

1584
01:53:27,155 --> 01:53:28,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, this would be before our next show.

1585
01:53:28,756 --> 01:53:33,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Payday 3 is also out in Japan in a regular and collector's edition overseas.

1586
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:34,179
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really it.

1587
01:53:35,727 --> 01:53:37,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've got a handful, too.

1588
01:53:37,608 --> 01:53:39,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's look at Europe.

1589
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:43,973
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 19th, for PlayStation and Switch, we have Gloomhaven.

[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the 21st, for PlayStation and Switch, we have Paper Man.

1594
01:54:03,106 --> 01:54:07,527
[SPEAKER_02]: For the 22nd, that's all of these last ones for the 22nd.

1595
01:54:07,527 --> 01:54:11,829
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation and Xbox Switch, we have Avatar The Last Airbender Quest for Balance.

01:54:19,791 --> 01:54:21,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1599

[SPEAKER_02]: On Switch, we have Pikmin 1 and 2.

1600
01:54:25,673 --> 01:54:29,854
[SPEAKER_02]: For the 3, we have Days of Doom and also Rainbow Higher Runway Rush.

1601
01:54:32,527 --> 01:54:34,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1602
01:54:34,469 --> 01:54:34,969
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1603
01:54:34,969 --> 01:54:36,871
[SPEAKER_02]: The end is near.

1604
01:54:36,871 --> 01:54:38,352
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for this week.

1605
01:54:38,352 --> 01:54:40,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll just be another big gaming news week as a result.

1606
01:54:40,854 --> 01:54:42,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1607
01:54:42,075 --> 01:54:43,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to a few more stories.

1608
01:54:43,817 --> 01:54:45,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, why don't you start us off?

1609
01:54:46,607 --> 01:54:48,128
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1610
01:54:48,128 --> 01:54:55,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we talked a little bit about the Embracer Group and how they were closing down Volition last week.

1611
01:54:55,053 --> 01:54:57,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not the end of it, unfortunately.

1612
01:54:57,394 --> 01:55:08,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So Embracer Group is actually looking to, once again, still trying to recover from that $2 billion short deal that they're supposed to be having with Saudi Arabia, their financing.

1613
01:55:08,962 --> 01:55:15,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now Gearbox Software may be up on the chopping block as far as being sold off.

1614
01:55:17,083 --> 01:55:18,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cool.

1615
01:55:18,563 --> 01:55:24,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could think of a company that begins with micro and ends with soft that's buying people up.

1616
01:55:24,004 --> 01:55:33,586
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I can see them purchasing, you know, these companies, but, um, yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised.

1617
01:55:33,586 --> 01:55:36,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have to see what ends up happening with that.

1618
01:55:36,247 --> 01:55:42,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it doesn't end up that they can't find a buyer and then everybody gets laid off, but we'll have to wait and see, I guess.

1619
01:55:42,548 --> 01:55:44,149
[SPEAKER_03]: The hits keep coming for Embracer.

1620
01:55:44,149 --> 01:55:45,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, boy, oh boy.

1621
01:55:45,089 --> 01:55:45,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1622
01:55:48,228 --> 01:55:50,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well then we'll move on.

1623
01:55:50,009 --> 01:55:53,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what else?

1624
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:54,951
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just all sorts of wacky.

1625
01:55:54,951 --> 01:56:05,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there is a game called RZ, The Jewel of Faramore, which apparently contains the voice actors and the artists from the Zelda CDI game.

1626
01:56:05,175 --> 01:56:08,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you see like a screenshot of this, it's like, oh, yep.

1627
01:56:09,297 --> 01:56:12,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go again.

1628
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:14,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And so... Why?

1629
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it looks cool.

1630
01:56:15,961 --> 01:56:16,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1631
01:56:16,581 --> 01:56:19,543
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that art style that resembles a CD-i.

1632
01:56:19,543 --> 01:56:21,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently they did animate everything.

1633
01:56:21,804 --> 01:56:28,688
[SPEAKER_01]: They hand-painted all of the animations and then translated them into the game.

1634
01:56:28,688 --> 01:56:37,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like... I mean, the artwork looks very much like... If someone told me this was from one of the CD-i Zelda games, I would absolutely believe that.

1635
01:56:38,114 --> 01:56:40,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Infamy is a very interesting way to put it, that's for sure.

1636
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:59,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so they're like saying that, you know, every single background in RZ is hand painted.

1637
01:56:59,223 --> 01:57:06,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So the design process was that I would do it all in the graph paper along with my design assistant and friend, John Lineman of Digital Foundry.

1638
01:57:06,986 --> 01:57:09,447
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of went back and forth on level designs.

1639
01:57:09,447 --> 01:57:16,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would gray box it and then would make a sketch based off of those refined gray boxes and hand it off to an artist to get painted.

1640
01:57:16,693 --> 01:57:22,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, the backgrounds in the CD-i version of the Zelda game I think were also hand-painted as well.

1641
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:28,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that, they said, we also have one of the painters from the original games that inspired RZ.

1642
01:57:28,427 --> 01:57:34,153
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like they almost wanted to make another Zelda CD-i type game, but of course, can't license Zelda.

1643
01:57:35,214 --> 01:57:37,395
[SPEAKER_01]: They also said, I reached out and pitched the project.

1644
01:57:37,395 --> 01:57:42,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I made sure they knew it wasn't a joke and that I was being serious and I wasn't just a crazy person.

1645
01:57:42,096 --> 01:57:43,616
[SPEAKER_01]: They were super on board.

1646
01:57:43,616 --> 01:57:47,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Made it very clear that this was a passion project, a love letter to those games.

1647
01:57:47,577 --> 01:57:48,797
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not making fun of them.

1648
01:57:48,797 --> 01:57:51,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they realized what I was doing, they were excited and we had lots of fun.

1649
01:57:51,958 --> 01:57:52,518
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.

1650
01:57:52,518 --> 01:57:59,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, it basically sounds like it is like, you know, they like the Zelda games, even though they're just really kind of cheesy and stupid.

1651
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:06,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're just trying to make like something that's like a spiritual successor to that type of stuff.

1652
01:58:06,141 --> 01:58:07,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what it makes me think of?

1653
01:58:07,541 --> 01:58:11,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of the people that have gone back and made like E.T.

1654
01:58:11,922 --> 01:58:18,023
[SPEAKER_03]: a better game or whatever or going back and taking Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 and making it look better.

1655
01:58:18,023 --> 01:58:26,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's it's one of those things where it's like you're into the game so much you're willing to kind of go in and like show what it could have been with a little more love.

1656
01:58:26,904 --> 01:58:27,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1657
01:58:27,444 --> 01:58:29,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's what this feels like to me, honestly.

1658
01:58:29,505 --> 01:58:30,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I think it'd be cool.

1659
01:58:31,163 --> 01:58:34,827
[SPEAKER_03]: SG100 Matt says, I look forward to it being on a silly block for GDQ.

1660
01:58:34,827 --> 01:58:38,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of GDQ, quick random tangent aside, but it's important.

1661
01:58:38,872 --> 01:58:40,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Because DarkSakura, you may not know this.

1662
01:58:40,674 --> 01:58:45,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some breaking news this evening earlier in the show on the show before us, actually.

1663
01:58:45,739 --> 01:58:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf is now coming to TwitchCon.

1664
01:58:48,822 --> 01:58:58,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because he will be one of seven hosts at GDQX, I think it's what it's called, but it's basically a mini GDQ that is happening at TwitchCon.

1665
01:58:58,710 --> 01:59:01,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Bobby auditioned to be a host and he's one of the hosts.

1666
01:59:01,813 --> 01:59:03,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty cool.

1667
01:59:03,774 --> 01:59:06,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was commenting- I'll be sure to come up in my pig cosplay.

1668
01:59:06,617 --> 01:59:16,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I was commenting, I think it's the first time me and him, me, him, and you have all gone to an expo since PAX 08.

1669
01:59:17,839 --> 01:59:18,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.

1670
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Yeah, yeah, you're right.

1671
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:22,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all of us.

1672
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:26,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because he never made it out for Gamer X. He always talked about it, but he never made it out.

1673
01:59:26,125 --> 01:59:29,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you sadly have never been to Dragon Con yet.

1674
01:59:29,527 --> 01:59:31,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I was joking.

1675
01:59:31,149 --> 01:59:34,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saying, Hey, if Loki could come to the gang would all be reunited.

1676
01:59:34,031 --> 01:59:35,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'd be fun.

1677
01:59:35,412 --> 01:59:36,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would be fun.

1678
01:59:36,212 --> 01:59:36,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do it.

1679
01:59:36,993 --> 01:59:40,875
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be the Hermitcraft people there, but I can't.

1680
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:42,216
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, can we kidnap you or something?

1681
01:59:42,216 --> 01:59:43,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we make it look like a crime?

1682
01:59:43,197 --> 01:59:45,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, maybe.

1683
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:46,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1684
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:47,140
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1685
01:59:48,434 --> 01:59:49,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one more story for you tonight.

1686
01:59:49,995 --> 01:59:51,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and you know what that means?

1687
01:59:51,175 --> 01:59:52,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1688
01:59:52,076 --> 01:59:54,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take Bobby to the pinball museum.

1689
01:59:54,457 --> 01:59:56,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he apparently so here's the thing.

1690
01:59:56,938 --> 01:59:58,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe maybe Bobby should tell the story.

1691
01:59:58,898 --> 01:59:59,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

1692
01:59:59,358 --> 02:00:01,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess I'm telling it.

1693
02:00:01,239 --> 02:00:03,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he told most of it on his show.

1694
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:08,342
[SPEAKER_03]: He has always told Mrs. Blackwolf that they could go to Vegas someday.

1695
02:00:08,342 --> 02:00:10,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's kind of

1696
02:00:10,985 --> 02:00:20,851
[SPEAKER_03]: doing this ahead of that promised trip, but since it's, and I'm using my quotey fingers, for work, he's allowed to go to Vegas without Mrs. Blackwolf.

1697
02:00:20,851 --> 02:00:24,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with the timing and everything, you know, why doesn't Mrs. Blackwolf just go too?

1698
02:00:24,914 --> 02:00:28,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that would have been great if, you know, the time off, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1699
02:00:28,216 --> 02:00:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's avoiding the big restaurants, the shows, and all that stuff.

1700
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:38,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby says in chat, she has expressly allowed me to go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.

1701
02:00:38,503 --> 02:00:39,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting there.

1702
02:00:41,084 --> 02:00:47,707
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, Mrs. Blackwolf gave express permission that the Pinball Hall of Fame is A-OK.

1703
02:00:47,707 --> 02:00:52,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think since it's no longer by the Liberace Museum, too, so you can avoid that.

1704
02:00:52,289 --> 02:00:54,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a big draw, the Liberace Museum.

1705
02:00:54,210 --> 02:01:00,473
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem with Pinball Hall of Fame now is that it is completely the south end of the Strip.

1706
02:01:00,473 --> 02:01:04,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And the TwitchCon is with the Convention Center at the north end of the Strip.

1707
02:01:04,915 --> 02:01:07,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the north end of the Strip, the When We Were Young Festival.

1708
02:01:09,015 --> 02:01:15,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting from north to south will probably be pretty easy, but going back is probably going to suck depending on the time of day.

1709
02:01:15,465 --> 02:01:17,549
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, definitely go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.

1710
02:01:17,549 --> 02:01:18,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cute.

1711
02:01:18,290 --> 02:01:22,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking Lyft everywhere, except for the places that I go with Terra.

1712
02:01:22,984 --> 02:01:24,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1713
02:01:24,605 --> 02:01:27,086
[SPEAKER_03]: sg100mat says I thought they moved it closer to the airport.

1714
02:01:27,086 --> 02:01:27,707
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

1715
02:01:27,707 --> 02:01:34,871
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that if you keep going just like a couple blocks further south on the strip, you're literally at the airport.

1716
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:37,112
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the pinball Hall of Fame is like right there.

1717
02:01:37,112 --> 02:01:37,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right.

1718
02:01:37,652 --> 02:01:39,333
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like across the street from Luxor.

1719
02:01:39,333 --> 02:01:46,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at this point or whatever is like maybe Bandolier Bay, one of those casinos that's really at the south end of the strip.

1720
02:01:46,858 --> 02:01:47,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Luxor.

1721
02:01:47,659 --> 02:01:48,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I have good memories of Luxor.

1722
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:54,648
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I played the eight-person in-car Daytona.

1723
02:01:54,648 --> 02:01:56,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

1724
02:01:56,250 --> 02:02:03,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when they had, like, a dead... This was... I was in early high school, I think?

1725
02:02:03,805 --> 02:02:11,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, um, we had, we had gone to Phoenix, um, to visit my mom when she was living there, married to the biker.

1726
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:16,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And she drove us, uh, from Phoenix to, um, Las Vegas.

1727
02:02:16,712 --> 02:02:21,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And on one of the days that rained, like, desert raining, you know?

1728
02:02:21,415 --> 02:02:21,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1729
02:02:22,656 --> 02:02:29,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were stuck in the Excalibur, but they had the tram, the monorail thing, going to the Luxor.

1730
02:02:29,624 --> 02:02:35,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went to the Luxor, and there was a big Sega arcade, and my mom just let me loose.

1731
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:37,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I played everything that I could.

1732
02:02:37,493 --> 02:02:38,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

1733
02:02:38,534 --> 02:02:40,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we went back to the Excalibur, and I shot a crossbow.

1734
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:49,482
[SPEAKER_03]: now, um, while it's on my mind to delve into completely personal stuff, since I know you're staying with Tiara and I really want to see them while I'm in Vegas.

1735
02:02:49,482 --> 02:02:51,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I haven't seen them in a long time.

1736
02:02:51,322 --> 02:02:59,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would love to, so either Thursday for dinner or Monday for, I don't know when you leave, but Monday for brunch, I'll still be there on Monday, Tuesday.

1737
02:02:59,284 --> 02:02:59,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1738
02:02:59,564 --> 02:03:00,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

1739
02:03:00,084 --> 02:03:02,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause our flight leaves late Monday, like late Monday.

1740
02:03:02,485 --> 02:03:04,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I would love to do like brunch.

1741
02:03:04,325 --> 02:03:07,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm flying out Tuesday and coming back Tuesday.

1742
02:03:07,046 --> 02:03:08,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's either Monday or Tuesday.

1743
02:03:08,126 --> 02:03:11,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so you're like making a whole week out of it to have like reunion and stuff.

1744
02:03:11,467 --> 02:03:12,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like TwitchCon.

1745
02:03:12,127 --> 02:03:12,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1746
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:23,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be able to do Just to Carry On because I'm going to have all my cosplay stuff with me and I'm totally going to that weird market at that one casino.

1747
02:03:23,261 --> 02:03:26,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to remember what it's called, like the Omni Market or something.

1748
02:03:26,485 --> 02:03:28,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is that where the after party's at?

1749
02:03:28,872 --> 02:03:30,354
[SPEAKER_03]: That that looks so cool.

1750
02:03:30,354 --> 02:03:31,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're talking about.

1751
02:03:31,215 --> 02:03:34,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's it's all like a photo op Instagram type of place.

1752
02:03:34,019 --> 02:03:36,382
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual official Twitch after party is there.

1753
02:03:36,382 --> 02:03:40,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking into it for a minute, but then I was like, I really want to go to that.

1754
02:03:40,828 --> 02:03:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, I just wanted to go to that market and buy weird shit.

1755
02:03:45,233 --> 02:03:46,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1756
02:03:46,194 --> 02:03:52,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was gonna say, okay, I didn't tell you what I ended up doing earlier that week.

1757
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:53,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it Omega Mart or something?

1758
02:03:53,781 --> 02:03:54,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Omega Mart.

1759
02:03:54,261 --> 02:03:55,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1760
02:03:55,282 --> 02:04:01,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so my friend was like, saying, you know what, for birthday, I want to go to Disneyland.

1761
02:04:01,207 --> 02:04:02,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do Oogie Boogie.

1762
02:04:02,248 --> 02:04:04,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do Oogie Boogie for my birthday.

1763
02:04:04,029 --> 02:04:05,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, Yes, we'll do it.

1764
02:04:05,551 --> 02:04:06,311
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to Disneyland.

1765
02:04:06,311 --> 02:04:09,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I realized it's the same week as TwitchCon.

1766
02:04:09,094 --> 02:04:11,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the hilarious part.

1767
02:04:11,056 --> 02:04:12,177
[SPEAKER_03]: We're flying down

1768
02:04:12,877 --> 02:04:21,402
[SPEAKER_03]: on Tuesday, going to Disney Tuesday night and Wednesday, we're going to the park, then we fly Thursday to Vegas and then do TwitchCon.

1769
02:04:21,402 --> 02:04:25,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we do TwitchCon, we'll be coming off a day and a half of Disney.

1770
02:04:25,784 --> 02:04:28,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We can we can always I'm always down for a Disney trip.

1771
02:04:28,706 --> 02:04:29,647
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

1772
02:04:29,647 --> 02:04:32,989
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't but I've already got my ticket for Las Vegas.

1773
02:04:32,989 --> 02:04:36,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and tiara tiara time will be great too.

1774
02:04:36,150 --> 02:04:38,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can do Disney another time.

1775
02:04:38,632 --> 02:04:38,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

1776
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:44,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have to do like, after holidays or something.

1777
02:04:44,314 --> 02:04:47,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you something about all that offline too.

1778
02:04:47,196 --> 02:04:49,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, okay.

1779
02:04:49,157 --> 02:04:50,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see.

1780
02:04:50,437 --> 02:04:55,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on though back less personal stuff.

1781
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:56,941
[SPEAKER_03]: More things that affect everybody.

1782
02:04:56,941 --> 02:04:57,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1783
02:04:57,641 --> 02:05:01,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's all the rage these days is launchers, that's right.

1784
02:05:01,324 --> 02:05:05,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, to do Baldur's Gate 3, you gotta get the Larian software launcher.

1785
02:05:05,368 --> 02:05:08,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You wanna play any Ubisoft game, you gotta get the Ubisoft launcher.

1786
02:05:08,511 --> 02:05:14,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we are sick and fucking tired of launchers, but you know what, let's pour one out for the one that started it all.

1787
02:05:14,716 --> 02:05:20,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, on September 12th, 2003, to play a little game that had just came out called Half-Life 2,

1788
02:05:22,042 --> 02:05:24,625
[SPEAKER_03]: You needed the Steam Launcher.

1789
02:05:24,625 --> 02:05:30,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steam has turned 20 years old this week, as Jason also named checked in our intro.

1790
02:05:30,371 --> 02:05:31,972
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1791
02:05:31,972 --> 02:05:33,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Steam is well known for its sales.

1792
02:05:33,854 --> 02:05:41,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also known for changing colors from the original olive green, you know, type of color system that had before.

1793
02:05:41,081 --> 02:05:44,345
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, now it is known as one of the behemoths of storefronts.

1794
02:05:44,345 --> 02:05:45,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's funny,

1795
02:05:45,886 --> 02:05:53,731
[SPEAKER_03]: People were so pissed off when they had to put that piece of software on their computer, just like we're pissed off at all the software that's trying to copy a success now.

1796
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:59,074
[SPEAKER_03]: To which really only Epic has been successful at even getting close, let's be real.

1797
02:05:59,074 --> 02:06:01,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't stop everybody from trying.

1798
02:06:01,475 --> 02:06:05,958
[SPEAKER_03]: There is, as DarkSakura referenced, a sale going on as well for the 20th birthday.

1799
02:06:06,398 --> 02:06:11,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing some interesting things like with like store pages or sorry, profile pages.

1800
02:06:11,983 --> 02:06:19,210
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use those little steam points you accumulate to buy things like an enhanced badge profile or whatever.

1801
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:21,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, you can buy a bunch of backgrounds.

1802
02:06:21,071 --> 02:06:23,734
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the stuff that's from trading cards.

1803
02:06:23,734 --> 02:06:26,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember DarkSakura texted me one yesterday.

1804
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,238
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, look, they have clue backgrounds.

1805
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:30,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, that is cool.

1806
02:06:30,099 --> 02:06:31,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically, it's Cluedo.

1807
02:06:31,861 --> 02:06:33,142
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going by the original name.

1808
02:06:33,302 --> 02:06:35,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I think the developer that made that game is overseas, too.

1809
02:06:35,985 --> 02:06:37,167
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, same, same.

1810
02:06:37,167 --> 02:06:38,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Clue, Cluedo.

1811
02:06:38,188 --> 02:06:41,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, pretty cool.

1812
02:06:41,972 --> 02:06:43,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what my background is now.

1813
02:06:43,634 --> 02:06:46,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, well, I don't know.

1814
02:06:46,597 --> 02:06:47,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Pac-Man, actually.

1815
02:06:47,939 --> 02:06:52,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 or one of those games.

1816
02:06:52,084 --> 02:06:52,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1817
02:06:52,691 --> 02:06:55,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is some retro new wave looking thing.

1818
02:06:55,973 --> 02:07:03,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest Buster in chat sums it up pretty succinctly in chat saying, then I bought the retail version of Half-Life 2 thinking I could avoid Steam.

1819
02:07:03,497 --> 02:07:06,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, my Steam backlog is so huge.

1820
02:07:06,879 --> 02:07:09,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Loki?

1821
02:07:09,181 --> 02:07:11,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1822
02:07:11,182 --> 02:07:13,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 800 games or so.

1823
02:07:13,023 --> 02:07:13,944
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1824
02:07:13,944 --> 02:07:20,167
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the show- I did go back and buy like counter- even though I'm never gonna play it, I bought Counter-Strike for like 79 cents.

1825
02:07:21,475 --> 02:07:24,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, because the discounts are pretty wacky right now.

1826
02:07:24,837 --> 02:07:27,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So but it's fun.

1827
02:07:27,458 --> 02:07:29,539
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the part of the show where we open it up to you all.

1828
02:07:29,539 --> 02:07:34,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the listener roundtable where we open it up for questions in our chat as well as our mailbag.

1829
02:07:34,181 --> 02:07:38,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at OrangeLingerieDo.com or our Discord server if you'd like to go to VOG.

1830
02:07:39,189 --> 02:07:43,791
[SPEAKER_03]: excuse me, hiccup, vognetwork.com slash discord and join the green room.

1831
02:07:43,791 --> 02:07:45,092
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll field a couple calls.

1832
02:07:45,092 --> 02:07:47,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you have a question, you can always shout it out in chat.

1833
02:07:47,593 --> 02:07:51,554
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the part of the show where I would encourage DarkSakura to go to the mailbag and read emails.

1834
02:07:51,554 --> 02:07:56,917
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I think we're on almost a month straight now of no emails.

1835
02:07:56,917 --> 02:07:59,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Spam needs to be cleaned out.

1836
02:07:59,138 --> 02:07:59,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1837
02:07:59,518 --> 02:08:02,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't have my hazmat suit available.

1838
02:08:03,037 --> 02:08:05,699
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, hey, we do have a question in the chat.

1839
02:08:05,699 --> 02:08:08,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody is taking me up on my offer of a roundtable question and chat.

1840
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:10,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bobby Blackwolf asked this question.

1841
02:08:10,703 --> 02:08:14,546
[SPEAKER_03]: My Nintendo Switch online sub is about to lapse.

1842
02:08:14,546 --> 02:08:18,249
[SPEAKER_03]: How has the expansion pass been for you since you upgraded to it?

1843
02:08:18,249 --> 02:08:27,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question, because you might remember I talked about it briefly on last week's show, but with my trip to Dragon Con, I finally decided, you know what?

1844
02:08:27,095 --> 02:08:29,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pony up the money for the expansion pass because

1845
02:08:30,658 --> 02:08:40,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, I thought that the Zelda Oracle of Ages and Seasons, I thought I would need the advanced player for that, because when I had them, it was on the advanced.

1846
02:08:40,648 --> 02:08:44,831
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, those were Game Boy Color games, so they're actually in the Game Boy Player.

1847
02:08:44,831 --> 02:08:50,357
[SPEAKER_03]: But it did get my brain thinking, and those came out, but it got my brain thinking like, oh,

1848
02:08:50,937 --> 02:08:53,079
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in that advanced library now?

1849
02:08:53,079 --> 02:08:55,021
[SPEAKER_03]: What's what's in all those libraries now?

1850
02:08:55,021 --> 02:08:56,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it worth it?

1851
02:08:56,282 --> 02:09:00,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, I was like, okay, they've expanded the N64 library quite a bit.

1852
02:09:00,005 --> 02:09:01,226
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot going on.

1853
02:09:01,226 --> 02:09:02,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you know what?

1854
02:09:03,247 --> 02:09:10,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really want to buy the Mario Cart expansion stuff, but it's all available as a part of the pass.

1855
02:09:10,069 --> 02:09:11,290
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you know what?

1856
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:11,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.

1857
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:14,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to finally pony up the money for the expansion pass.

1858
02:09:14,991 --> 02:09:16,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And has it been worth it?

1859
02:09:16,992 --> 02:09:18,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I've been having fun.

1860
02:09:18,672 --> 02:09:20,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I played a lot of the advanced stuff.

1861
02:09:21,673 --> 02:09:26,416
[SPEAKER_03]: like Mario Advance, Mario Advance 2, WarioWare back when it was good.

1862
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I played all of those on the Game Boy Advance emulator and had a good time with it.

1863
02:09:30,038 --> 02:09:31,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was playing N64 stuff too.

1864
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:38,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Pokemon Puzzle League, which yes, I know we already had Tetris Attack, but Pokemon Puzzle League had Pokemon.

1865
02:09:38,683 --> 02:09:42,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had like the round stages that are in the cylinder and all that other stuff.

1866
02:09:42,125 --> 02:09:43,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of fun.

1867
02:09:43,666 --> 02:09:43,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1868
02:09:45,905 --> 02:09:55,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, especially at this point, now that the Mario Kart 8 expansion is fully realized, just about, I think we still, you know, we got the announcement of the last bit of it coming out.

1869
02:09:55,027 --> 02:10:04,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that that's fully realized, if you didn't already pay for that separately, which Bobby says he did, whoops, that would make it worth it because you did pay for that.

1870
02:10:04,608 --> 02:10:08,649
[SPEAKER_03]: What's left for you?

1871
02:10:08,649 --> 02:10:13,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The Animal Crossing, but most most people are kind of past Animal Crossing at this point.

1872
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:15,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really surprised.

1873
02:10:16,265 --> 02:10:23,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to the Nintendo Direct stuff, I was really surprised they didn't actually announce more stuff for Animal Crossing.

1874
02:10:23,089 --> 02:10:26,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised they did not do more DLC for that game.

1875
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:33,335
[SPEAKER_03]: With as big as that game was, that actually is a legit surprise, because Nintendo has been known to support even older games with DLC.

1876
02:10:33,335 --> 02:10:34,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Mario Kart.

1877
02:10:34,456 --> 02:10:36,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of surprised about that, to be honest.

1878
02:10:36,857 --> 02:10:37,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hmm.

1879
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:44,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby in chat says, honestly, at this point, Animal Crossing just now reminds me of quarantine.

1880
02:10:44,614 --> 02:10:46,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I never thought of that.

1881
02:10:46,775 --> 02:10:50,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that game have a stigma around it now?

1882
02:10:50,558 --> 02:10:51,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1883
02:10:51,518 --> 02:10:53,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really thought about that.

1884
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:58,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe by the time they release a new game.

1885
02:10:58,263 --> 02:11:00,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't associate it the same way.

1886
02:11:00,585 --> 02:11:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just that I think I hit the point where I did everything I was gonna do.

1887
02:11:04,863 --> 02:11:15,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I I get that perspective though I do like I think my love of Animal Crossing predates that but I get it like yeah, I just think that's, that's interesting.

1888
02:11:15,989 --> 02:11:19,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you're not the only one that would have a thought like that.

1889
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:20,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1890
02:11:20,911 --> 02:11:21,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the whole thing.

1891
02:11:21,591 --> 02:11:23,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's kind of one of those Oh, I never stopped to think about that.

1892
02:11:23,852 --> 02:11:26,514
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that I am I'm like, huh?

1893
02:11:26,514 --> 02:11:27,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be interesting.

1894
02:11:27,494 --> 02:11:28,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1895
02:11:28,855 --> 02:11:29,095
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1896
02:11:30,402 --> 02:11:34,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't see any other chat questions or comments.

1897
02:11:34,285 --> 02:11:37,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's going to do it for another episode of the show.

1898
02:11:37,688 --> 02:11:38,629
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of news tonight.

1899
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:39,990
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some good stuff tonight.

1900
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:45,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it all up.

1901
02:11:45,034 --> 02:11:50,179
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I believe you're still streaming tonight, since everything's all wrapped up with holidays, right?

1902
02:11:51,227 --> 02:11:59,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired, so I may play a little Dead by Daylight, but there's a chance I might switch to Dreamlight Valley just because I'm really exhausted.

1903
02:11:59,219 --> 02:12:01,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a very emotional day today.

1904
02:12:01,722 --> 02:12:02,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Play what you want.

1905
02:12:02,504 --> 02:12:03,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Dreamlight's fun, too.

1906
02:12:04,251 --> 02:12:06,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I want to try for more adepts.

1907
02:12:06,433 --> 02:12:09,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my xenomorph adept already.

1908
02:12:09,074 --> 02:12:15,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of been on a big alien kick too, like looking for deleted scenes.

1909
02:12:15,659 --> 02:12:21,623
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a channel I've been following called, I have to look it up again, it's like Alien Theory or something like that.

1910
02:12:23,064 --> 02:12:31,009
[SPEAKER_02]: where they go into like the Apocrypha and we're recapping like original scripts and stuff like that.

1911
02:12:31,009 --> 02:12:42,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found out that Dark Horse actually did a comic of the original Space Beast script that turned into the first alien movie.

1912
02:12:42,716 --> 02:12:44,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty good.

1913
02:12:44,477 --> 02:12:48,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and yes, there was a cat.

1914
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:48,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

1915
02:12:48,893 --> 02:12:49,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect, perfect.

1916
02:12:49,453 --> 02:12:56,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tempted to write a story called Jonesy's Tale, which is all just about the movie from Jonesy's point of view.

1917
02:12:56,937 --> 02:12:59,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans are stupid.

1918
02:12:59,738 --> 02:13:02,360
[SPEAKER_02]: They really should have listened to mom.

1919
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:08,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with that, DarkSakura, any other final thoughts for us before you go off to set up for your stream?

1920
02:13:08,743 --> 02:13:11,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I have new merch.

1921
02:13:11,744 --> 02:13:13,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And where can people check that out?

1922
02:13:13,946 --> 02:13:15,146
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com.

1923
02:13:15,146 --> 02:13:16,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

1924
02:13:16,047 --> 02:13:16,247
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1925
02:13:16,247 --> 02:13:16,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good stream.

1926
02:13:20,363 --> 02:13:24,305
[SPEAKER_03]: As I always say at the end of every show, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two.

1927
02:13:24,305 --> 02:13:30,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on the air.

1928
02:13:30,388 --> 02:13:33,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell a friend, tell two friends, tell 20 friends.

1929
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:37,792
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way as well, and we really appreciate that.

1930
02:13:37,792 --> 02:13:42,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Spotify, wherever it is you found this show, please consider a kind word there.

1931
02:13:42,014 --> 02:13:43,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We would appreciate it.

1932
02:13:44,815 --> 02:13:53,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget to visit us on our discord server, vognetwork.com slash discord and don't forget to follow VOG Network all over the interwebs on your favorite social media sites.

1933
02:13:53,637 --> 02:13:56,377
[SPEAKER_03]: With all that, Loki, we're over to you.

1934
02:13:56,377 --> 02:14:00,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have I didn't ask you if you had any last minute stories, but I'm assuming we got it all out tonight.

1935
02:14:00,478 --> 02:14:02,939
