00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
Cup Noodle announces the greatest innovation in noodles since the instant noodle itself.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.440
Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.180
On the grind, you need a quick fix while you quickly unwind?

00:19.180 --> 00:21.280
Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.280
Need a pick-you-up that won't thick you up?

00:23.280 --> 00:25.440
Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.760
Real talk, would slurp yearly.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.280
This is the RGB package intro.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.280
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:32.280 --> 00:35.760
this and the rest of the two weeks in gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:35.760 --> 00:37.240
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.240 --> 00:46.600
Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.600 --> 00:54.260
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again, as Jason said there in the intro.

00:54.260 --> 00:56.940
After missing last week, we'll talk about that.

00:56.940 --> 01:04.280
For tonight, September the 10th of 2023, episode number 973, and now live and on the air.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.500
And with me tonight, joining me as always, say hello first off to Dark Sakura or Jamie

01:09.500 --> 01:10.500
Summers.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.500
Hello.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.500
Hello.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.500
Hello.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.500
How are you?

01:14.500 --> 01:18.380
How was your week off?

01:18.380 --> 01:19.380
What week off?

01:19.380 --> 01:20.380
I guess.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.380
Well, technically-

01:21.380 --> 01:22.380
I did a 13-hour stream.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.380
Oh, that's true.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.380
That's true.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.020
So you were working, but different type of work.

01:26.100 --> 01:29.640
Yeah, I was working it, but I didn't advertise enough, so only a few people were there.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.760
But I appreciate the people who were, and I made a bunch of friends during my subathon,

01:33.760 --> 01:44.100
and honestly, it's just the last few series of weeks have just been compostable.

01:44.100 --> 01:49.400
It's probably was a tricky weekend to do a subathon to with all the stuff that goes on

01:49.400 --> 01:54.140
for Labor Day, between Dragon Con where I was at, Penny Arcade Expo, I know here locally

01:54.140 --> 01:59.220
SAC Anime, it's a big convention weekend, and the other types of holiday junk that

01:59.220 --> 02:00.220
people do.

02:00.220 --> 02:04.060
None of that had anything to do with what was going on with my week though.

02:04.060 --> 02:06.620
I'm just saying the subathon attendance, yeah, yeah.

02:06.620 --> 02:11.300
Yeah, I mean, but I honestly, I didn't advertise it enough, and that's really what it was.

02:11.300 --> 02:17.060
And I mean, given that I have people from all over the world who don't necessarily celebrate

02:17.060 --> 02:22.420
the same holiday or have to deal with our conventions, so it was just all my fault.

02:22.420 --> 02:27.060
Well, you got to play video games all day though, so hopefully that was still fun.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.900
All day solo queue.

02:28.900 --> 02:29.900
Wow.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.900
Except for a little bit.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.900
I played with a few people.

02:32.900 --> 02:37.060
All right, well, also joining us tonight, even though he's not on video yet, he is with

02:37.060 --> 02:38.060
us.

02:38.060 --> 02:39.340
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:39.340 --> 02:40.620
Happy early birthday.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.900
I've been here the whole time.

02:42.900 --> 02:43.900
That's right.

02:43.900 --> 02:44.900
You said what's going on?

02:44.900 --> 02:46.620
You're not on video right now, but you will be later.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.100
You're like rendering a video or something?

02:48.100 --> 02:52.220
I am rendering a video that I've been working, editing for literally a month.

02:52.220 --> 02:54.660
Oh, yeah, I've seen your posts about this.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.340
You've been working very hard on this.

02:56.340 --> 03:04.740
Yes, it's been a whole month that I've been editing this video, and now it is it is done

03:04.740 --> 03:09.620
well is so done well as Dark Sakura beat me to it.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.620
Happy early birthday.

03:10.620 --> 03:11.620
Thank you.

03:11.620 --> 03:14.220
Because I know your birthday is tomorrow.

03:14.220 --> 03:17.500
It's a day that a lot of people remember your birthday.

03:17.500 --> 03:25.020
And I have a disaster birthday, you know, mine was the Waco thing.

03:25.020 --> 03:29.480
Whereas my birthday is the day that sodomy laws got overturned.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.760
And there's also the gay marriage legalization day.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.020
So I have a bit of a celebration day.

03:34.020 --> 03:37.060
Although I will say I also share birthday with Tim Curry.

03:37.060 --> 03:38.060
So there's that.

03:38.060 --> 03:39.900
Oh, that is that is pretty good.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.100
My big birthday share is Ariana Grande.

03:42.100 --> 03:49.620
So who's your big birthday share, Loki?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.340
Maybe we don't do Wikipedia.

03:51.340 --> 03:54.020
Maybe we should maybe we should talk about the big event.

03:54.020 --> 03:58.700
He shares his birthday with no, no, no, like, okay, well, I'm gonna try not to like, put

03:58.700 --> 04:00.500
this in Debbie Downer mode here.

04:00.500 --> 04:05.140
But no, like, so it was a bit of ironic trivia.

04:05.140 --> 04:12.020
So I saw the other day, like on on Facebook, it was reminded to me that Steve Irwin passed

04:12.020 --> 04:15.980
on September 4th, which happens to be the day that my mom passed as well as like, Oh,

04:15.980 --> 04:16.980
that's interesting.

04:16.980 --> 04:18.820
They passed on the same day.

04:18.820 --> 04:22.260
But no, I know that's not positive at all.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.260
Moby.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.260
I mean, that's cool.

04:24.260 --> 04:26.940
Oh, that's doubly cool.

04:26.940 --> 04:27.940
There's your answer.

04:27.940 --> 04:28.940
There you go.

04:28.940 --> 04:29.940
I'll take that.

04:29.940 --> 04:31.980
And apparently Ludacris and John Ritter.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.620
Oh, wow.

04:33.620 --> 04:38.700
That's one heck of an action movie right there.

04:38.700 --> 04:39.700
And Harry Connick Jr.

04:40.700 --> 04:41.700
I love it.

04:41.700 --> 04:42.700
I say that.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.700
Yeah.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.700
Oh, hey.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.700
There's some folks.

04:45.700 --> 04:49.940
Well, Loki, I'm glad you're getting you're getting a YouTube finish for your birthday.

04:49.940 --> 04:50.940
That's really exciting.

04:50.940 --> 04:53.140
I am I'm going to be premiering it tomorrow.

04:53.140 --> 04:57.260
It is my season two finale of Channel 64.

04:57.260 --> 05:03.340
Yes, the season three is technically started like two or three weeks ago, but it took a

05:03.340 --> 05:04.340
while.

05:04.340 --> 05:08.380
It is essentially like a mini movie.

05:08.380 --> 05:15.660
It is almost 35 minutes long with credits.

05:15.660 --> 05:23.660
It is the culmination of all of the lore and S&Ps that I've been on since the beginning

05:23.660 --> 05:26.620
of making Minecraft content.

05:26.620 --> 05:29.580
And it is.

05:29.580 --> 05:35.940
There's a lot of like deeply emotional things that are going along with it, I guess, like,

05:35.940 --> 05:41.380
I don't know, like it sounds really like like depressing, but like it's it's basically

05:41.380 --> 05:43.820
it's there's a lot of themes that go along with it.

05:43.820 --> 05:48.740
And especially if you've watched my older content, then you would catch a lot of the

05:48.740 --> 05:50.460
stuff that's in this one.

05:50.460 --> 05:53.900
There's a lot of like kind of ties back to everything.

05:53.900 --> 05:58.420
It's not only celebrating the lore that I've created in like my stuff, but the lore that's

05:58.420 --> 06:04.060
been created in Channel 64 lore that's been created in other S&Ps that get brought up

06:04.060 --> 06:06.420
in this.

06:06.420 --> 06:14.180
It is been the most painful thing I've had to edit because like like put it this way.

06:14.180 --> 06:18.980
So like a normal like Minecraft video that I put together and stuff like has, you know,

06:18.980 --> 06:23.220
it's like it's like say, OK, well, a lot of these more recent ones.

06:23.220 --> 06:30.380
OK, so it seems like, you know, maybe 20 video files, you know, audio wise, there's like

06:30.380 --> 06:34.380
maybe 10 audio clips or something like that.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.300
This one has three hundred forty four.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.580
There's one hundred and eighty.

06:38.580 --> 06:42.580
Last I count, there was one hundred and eighty, one hundred and ninety replay mod shots they

06:42.580 --> 06:45.620
had to create and edit.

06:45.620 --> 06:50.260
But that was probably two thirds of the way through the whole process.

06:50.260 --> 06:53.580
So I don't even know what the new count is, but it's a lot.

06:53.580 --> 06:58.500
So it was a lot of stuff and a lot of special effects things I had to do.

06:58.500 --> 07:04.900
A lot of AI voices, a lot of voice lines by our voice actors as well.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.180
Just a lot of everything.

07:07.180 --> 07:10.920
But it's very it's action packed.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.980
It's got emotional beats in there.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.380
It's just got everything.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.440
Well, that is my pitch.

07:16.440 --> 07:20.060
You absolutely need to use your birthday to guilt people into watching it.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.060
So that's what I said earlier.

07:21.060 --> 07:24.260
I said I'm going to earn those guilt or use those guilt points that like get people to

07:24.260 --> 07:25.260
watch the video.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.260
Do it.

07:26.260 --> 07:27.260
Do it.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.260
It's a great time.

07:28.260 --> 07:30.260
And it really I poured everything into this.

07:30.260 --> 07:32.300
So I hope people enjoy it.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.300
All right.

07:33.300 --> 07:36.900
Well, we will look for that on the socials tomorrow, including the VOG Network Discord,

07:36.900 --> 07:40.700
where I know you'll post that over at VOG Network dot com slash Discord.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.780
Again, that's VOG Network dot com slash Discord.

07:42.780 --> 07:45.220
A great place to chat with us throughout the week.

07:45.220 --> 07:49.060
Speaking of birthdays, it is so tomorrow is your birthday.

07:49.060 --> 07:56.260
But I noticed in chat a reminder that today is Pod Culture's birthday, which is funny

07:56.260 --> 08:00.420
because I actually got to see him at Dragon Con where I was at last week.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.580
So happy birthday, Brad from Pod Culture.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.860
And it was great to see you in person last week.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.740
So I hope you are having the best.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.860
I know you brought back a nasty souvenir from Dragon Con, but I hope you are having the

08:10.860 --> 08:13.620
best birthday possible in light of all that.

08:13.620 --> 08:17.060
And yeah, I hope I hope everything's going great for you.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.500
And Dragon Con quickly.

08:18.500 --> 08:23.620
I will say, you know, I am not going to go too much into depth in Dragon Con because

08:23.620 --> 08:25.340
I've talked a lot about it on this show.

08:25.340 --> 08:29.900
And I want to nudge you over to our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.

08:29.900 --> 08:34.740
Bobby and I not only did a Dragon Con preview show before, but we did a Dragon Con wrap

08:34.740 --> 08:36.700
up show earlier this week.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.820
So if you want to hear all about some of the details and some of our suggestions to make

08:40.820 --> 08:43.300
2024 even better, I'm going to point you in that direction.

08:43.300 --> 08:47.700
But I will just quickly say once again, a big thank you to the video game track as well

08:47.700 --> 08:51.060
as the digital media track for having me back and taking part in some panels.

08:51.060 --> 08:55.140
I got to moderate for the video game track a really cool panel on diversity in video

08:55.140 --> 08:56.300
games.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.420
And the only bummer was that some of our speakers kind of had to back out at the last minute

09:00.420 --> 09:06.220
for whatever reason, you know, whether you know it's sickness or whatever conflict, whatever.

09:06.220 --> 09:12.060
So we only had it was me and two panelists, one who's kind of worked in AAA games, she's

09:12.060 --> 09:16.660
worked on some pretty prominent, you know, like, like Star Wars related things.

09:16.660 --> 09:20.900
And then the other one, she was an indie developer who created, ironically, a game I saw at some

09:20.900 --> 09:22.420
of the Friday gaming Expo.

09:22.420 --> 09:26.580
So I was like, I remember you, I remember your hat and your game and all that stuff.

09:26.580 --> 09:30.140
So but I bring that up because they were great.

09:30.140 --> 09:34.180
And I was really I have to be honest, I was really worried about going into a panel with

09:34.180 --> 09:36.980
just two other people to talk about diversity.

09:36.980 --> 09:39.860
But but oh, they did fantastic.

09:39.860 --> 09:41.500
I was so happy to be a part of that panel.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.820
I thought we had a really good discussion.

09:42.820 --> 09:47.520
So I'm sorry, but not every panel at Dragon Con is streamed, because they kind of want

09:47.520 --> 09:49.520
you to go to Dragon Con.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.800
So that one is not streamed.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.660
So you'll just have to come next year to see a similar panel hopefully.

09:54.660 --> 09:59.520
But the digital media track panels because the content is about digital media, it does

09:59.520 --> 10:02.240
make sense that that is then archived on digital media.

10:02.240 --> 10:09.200
So I will point you over to the YouTube channel for digital media, which is DC Digital Media

10:09.200 --> 10:10.200
on YouTube.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.740
That's DC Digital Media.

10:11.740 --> 10:14.040
And somebody should probably drop the link here in a moment.

10:14.040 --> 10:20.440
We just put up a YouTube of a panel that Bobby and I did with somebody you might know from

10:20.440 --> 10:24.120
TikTok, who does very well there.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.520
I think he just changed his name as of last week to the fit guy.

10:28.520 --> 10:34.640
But we all know him as Kurt and or Vobe Kurt, as I joke, because it's actually VO or voice

10:34.640 --> 10:38.560
over by Kurt, but some people say it Vobe Kurt, and I think it sounds cute.

10:38.560 --> 10:43.980
But that panel is it was thriving on streaming media when you're over 40 years old, which

10:43.980 --> 10:48.220
to be honest, a lot of people go, how is that different from thriving when you're 20 and

10:48.220 --> 10:49.220
30?

10:49.220 --> 10:50.220
Excellent question.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.220
We answered in the panel.

10:51.220 --> 10:52.740
So go check it out over on YouTube.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.780
So a shout out for that panel.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.340
So yes.

10:56.340 --> 11:00.740
Okay, that's my plug for Dragon Con related content.

11:00.740 --> 11:02.400
And thanks again for having me.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.260
And I am already planning for 2024, as is Alan.

11:06.260 --> 11:09.420
Alan, remember, this was Alan's first Dragon Con.

11:09.420 --> 11:13.020
And he saw enough in the con, even though he was a little overwhelmed by, I think, just

11:13.060 --> 11:16.740
all the people and all the things there was to do it can it can absolutely be sensory

11:16.740 --> 11:17.740
overload.

11:17.740 --> 11:22.420
I think sometimes he's like, I see the potential and things I want to do next year.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.420
So he's gonna come back.

11:23.420 --> 11:25.100
That'd be great.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.480
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

11:28.480 --> 11:33.380
We missed quite a few things this last week, especially because at the same time Dragon

11:33.380 --> 11:38.180
Cons going on, and the arcade Expo is going on as well as some other conventions around

11:38.180 --> 11:39.180
the country.

11:39.180 --> 11:43.060
And we saw a few headlines that came out from over the long weekend last weekend.

11:43.060 --> 11:46.020
Loki, I don't know if you want to jump into some of these or you want me to take?

11:46.020 --> 11:47.020
Sure.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.020
Okay, cool.

11:48.020 --> 11:50.940
Yeah, I don't know too much about the Final Fantasy 16 stuff because I haven't been paying

11:50.940 --> 11:51.940
attention to it.

11:51.940 --> 11:56.140
But I do remember though, they did make the announcement that they are going to be doing

11:56.140 --> 12:02.660
a PC version that is in development and that there is also going to be some two DLCs that

12:02.660 --> 12:04.220
are going to be added as well.

12:04.220 --> 12:08.260
And then they have an update that they've added to the game.

12:08.380 --> 12:12.700
The PC version I'm excited about because then I actually get to play it because I am not

12:12.700 --> 12:14.800
buying a console for a game.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
So sorry.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.140
And people are going to mod the hell out of it.

12:17.140 --> 12:18.140
So that's going to be interesting.

12:18.140 --> 12:23.900
I mean, yeah, like, yeah, that's how it goes.

12:23.900 --> 12:28.980
How many days until a nude Sid and a nude Clive mod?

12:28.980 --> 12:30.980
Less than zero.

12:30.980 --> 12:37.380
The question is though, do we get nude mod before we get CJ mod from San Andreas?

12:37.820 --> 12:39.340
Which one comes first?

12:39.340 --> 12:40.340
That's the better question now.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.340
Like nude mod.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.340
Yeah.

12:42.340 --> 12:43.340
Guaranteed.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.340
CJ mod.

12:44.340 --> 12:45.340
Yep.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.340
Guaranteed.

12:46.340 --> 12:47.340
Which one comes first?

12:47.340 --> 12:48.340
That's a good question.

12:48.340 --> 12:49.340
That's the new meta.

12:49.340 --> 12:50.340
We got to start betting on that stuff.

12:50.340 --> 12:51.340
That's right.

12:51.340 --> 12:57.420
But yeah, so they're going to they added an update which gave you a weapon skin feature

12:57.420 --> 13:03.020
and also the onion sword weapon and new outfits.

13:03.020 --> 13:05.540
And then of course, the two paid DLC.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.700
I don't know if they go into detail what those are going to be about necessarily.

13:08.700 --> 13:13.900
They did not talk about specifics, at least as far as I caught about what they will be

13:13.900 --> 13:14.900
about.

13:14.900 --> 13:22.380
There's a lot of speculation that because Leviathan was missing from the, you know,

13:22.380 --> 13:27.260
the lineup of, you know, icons, I keep wanting to say primals because they aren't 14.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.940
They're just like summons.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.220
It's all summons to me at this point.

13:31.220 --> 13:34.660
And honestly, fair, a fair way to look at it.

13:34.660 --> 13:37.940
But that's the speculation.

13:37.940 --> 13:41.380
But then there's also been talk about that they might set it.

13:41.380 --> 13:46.300
It might actually be set either in the time gap, because there is a fast forward between

13:46.300 --> 13:50.100
the prologue and then what you see later in the game.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.500
And or even before the prologue.

13:52.500 --> 13:56.060
So there's talks about that maybe the DLC will actually be a little more standalone,

13:56.060 --> 13:57.260
which could be interesting.

13:57.260 --> 14:02.520
But yeah, I, I'm okay with there being DLC.

14:02.520 --> 14:08.640
I would rather see a 16-2 eventually that could fix some of the issues that 16 had.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.160
Not just technically, but you know, with lack of representation and things like that would

14:13.160 --> 14:15.240
be a great thing to add into the world.

14:15.240 --> 14:19.560
That's why the PC version, you know, we can fix some of that.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.200
Maybe the DLC will address some of that.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.840
Maybe we'll go to another continent and we'll see a little more diversity.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.840
I don't know.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.240
I think it's really early to say.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.240
But we'll see.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.240
We'll see where it takes us.

14:29.240 --> 14:33.960
I'm glad that in light of the stories, we saw a couple of weeks ago where people were

14:33.960 --> 14:38.560
like final fantasy 16 only sold 3 million copies or whatever it was.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.960
I don't even remember how many copies it was.

14:39.960 --> 14:40.960
Oh God.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.960
Tomb Raider all over again.

14:41.960 --> 14:42.960
Yeah.

14:42.960 --> 14:43.960
And all that stuff.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.960
Like, I'm glad to hear it is doing well enough where they are talking about DLC.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.760
And I mean the PC version, come on.

14:49.760 --> 14:55.160
We all knew it was, we all knew it was coming and it was just some, some dumb arrangement

14:55.160 --> 14:57.640
that was keeping their lips sealed on that.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.640
But we all knew that was coming.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.040
We would never do that.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.400
That's what the, that's what the competition does.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
And that's bad.

15:03.400 --> 15:07.560
We fight against that in the, we would never do that.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.560
That's awful.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.560
Yeah.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.920
So, um, it's, it's nice to see that that is all confirmed and all that good stuff.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
So.

15:14.920 --> 15:15.920
Yeah.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.920
Yeah.

15:16.920 --> 15:17.920
Uh, yeah.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.840
So I'm excited for, Oh, and the other thing, I know this probably is not on your list,

15:20.840 --> 15:23.920
but I want to say it about final fantasy 16 at PAX.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.720
I was a little jealous.

15:25.720 --> 15:29.480
Usually I am not jealous about the decision to go to dragon con over packs.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.360
I've let my feelings be known on this show.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.360
It is what it is.

15:32.360 --> 15:38.520
However, Ben star went to packs and I was a little jealous about that.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.760
And not only he wasn't the only one, several of the 16 voice actors all went to packs because

15:42.760 --> 15:46.040
they, they did a panel where all this was basically announced.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.520
So it's a little jealous about that.

15:47.520 --> 15:53.720
And I'm hoping maybe dragon con will get the 16 voice actors next year because I I'll tell

15:53.720 --> 16:02.920
you to, I will, I would do just about anything and I mean it to moderate that panel with

16:02.920 --> 16:03.920
Ben star.

16:03.920 --> 16:10.520
I'm just saying just about, but don't get crazy, but just about anything.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.520
All right.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.920
That's all I have to say.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.800
A little bit confused by, by Ben star.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.800
You're a little bit confused.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.800
I actually don't know who that is.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.200
Oh, he's the, he's the voice of Clyde.

16:19.200 --> 16:27.120
The Ben star that, cause the Ben star I know of was on a master chef and it was really

16:27.120 --> 16:28.120
cool.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.640
Uh, no, this is, this is sexy, uh, Clyde voice actor.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.640
Yes.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.640
Who this is.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.640
Yes.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.960
This is the one that Loki said on last, there are two weeks ago show or whatever.

16:37.960 --> 16:42.640
Like, Hey, like even I get it.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.800
I mean, he's an attractive man who has a deep, deep sultry voice.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.440
I mean like, what are you going to do?

16:48.480 --> 16:51.600
What's his, what's his, uh, he has a, he has a Twitter account.

16:51.600 --> 16:56.240
That's where he posts all these things with like, um, you know, pretending to do voices

16:56.240 --> 16:57.800
of Mario and things like that.

16:57.800 --> 17:03.440
He does all these, uh, things and he's just, he's, it's not just his looks.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.160
I mean, but the voice too, it's those things together.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.200
It's, it's very, yes.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.200
That's all I'm going to say.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.200
Anyway.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.200
Next story.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.200
All right.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
So they did a Nintendo.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.960
Sorry, sorry.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.680
My, I'm having some lag.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680
I apologize.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
No, you're fine.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
No worries.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
No worries.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.880
Um, so Nintendo did a super Mario wonder direct and showed off a little bit more of the game

17:25.880 --> 17:28.360
and some of the different gameplay elements to it.

17:28.360 --> 17:29.360
Actually watch this.

17:29.360 --> 17:35.000
I, it feels like ages ago at this point, but, um, they showed off that this is the flower

17:35.000 --> 17:36.520
kingdom that you're in now.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.960
So not necessarily the mushroom kingdom.

17:38.960 --> 17:43.880
They have six distinct worlds that are in this game.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.240
And then what's kind of cool about that is there's, um, some of the different levels

17:47.240 --> 17:51.440
that are in there, you can actually tackle in any order that you want.

17:51.440 --> 17:56.720
Um, a little more disappointing though, is the fact that all of the different characters

17:56.720 --> 17:58.040
that they have available.

17:58.040 --> 18:07.480
So like Luigi, peach, uh, Daisy, toad, um, and toadette all play the same, which I feel

18:07.480 --> 18:11.280
is kind of like, you know, a missed opportunity.

18:11.280 --> 18:17.600
However, they do have, um, as part of that kind of being more open to gamers that may

18:17.600 --> 18:19.760
not necessarily be as good.

18:19.760 --> 18:26.360
Um, they have Yoshi and nabbit that have different effects to them.

18:26.360 --> 18:31.520
Uh, that allows the game to be played in a way that, you know, is much easier, you know,

18:31.520 --> 18:35.320
with of course, like the floaty jumps that Yoshi has.

18:35.320 --> 18:43.040
And I think also just not really being able to, uh, let's see, yeah, Yoshi, let's see.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.520
You can also ride Yoshi.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.920
Someone else is playing them as well.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.920
That's kind of cool.

18:46.920 --> 18:52.980
Uh, they showed a bunch of new powerups, uh, like the elephant fruit and you can, uh, blow

18:52.980 --> 18:54.560
bubbles and whatnot with that.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.560
That's kind of cool.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.160
A very pretty looking game altogether.

18:58.160 --> 19:03.680
And then they also have this weird kind of multiplayer mode where, uh, you actually see

19:03.680 --> 19:09.500
other players running around in the game at the same time and you can even, uh, leave

19:09.500 --> 19:16.560
messages for them or like leave icons or it's almost like little cardboard cutouts that

19:16.560 --> 19:17.560
you leave in the game.

19:17.560 --> 19:23.160
And then if you die, if that bubble hits that thing, then you come back to life or something

19:23.160 --> 19:24.160
like that.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.160
I don't know.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.160
It's interesting.

19:26.160 --> 19:30.360
Um, and then they talked about like kind of the flowers that you can get that kind of

19:30.360 --> 19:34.720
twist everything around and those are in game as well and it looks pretty trippy.

19:34.720 --> 19:41.520
So it's, it's touch fuzzy, get dizzy vibes all over again, but you know, different drugs

19:41.520 --> 19:44.280
this time.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.960
But this is coming out in October on the 20th so it looks pretty sweet.

19:47.960 --> 19:48.960
I will say it.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.960
I am definitely picking it up.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.960
It looks neat.

19:50.960 --> 19:51.960
Yeah.

19:51.960 --> 19:52.960
It's one of those things like how can you not pick it up?

19:52.960 --> 19:53.960
Like it looks really good.

19:53.960 --> 20:00.000
Um, but, um, I, I do see where it's unfortunate that the characters don't have a little more

20:00.000 --> 20:03.960
of their personality like they did even as far back as super Mario brothers too.

20:03.960 --> 20:08.320
But I get maybe for game balancing and what I really think they're going for, you know,

20:08.320 --> 20:10.240
it's, it's Nintendo's bread and butter.

20:10.240 --> 20:15.520
It's multiplayer gaming on the couch with young kids, hence the nabbit and all that

20:15.520 --> 20:16.520
stuff.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.500
Like that's very much what they want to go for with this game.

20:19.500 --> 20:24.880
They want something that you unwrap under the proverbial Christmas tree or whatever

20:24.880 --> 20:25.880
it is you celebrate.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.280
You unwrap it and you go right to playing it with the whole family.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.240
That is very much the game they're going for.

20:30.240 --> 20:34.040
Um, and I think honestly these decisions are going to suit them fine.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.600
The games, the game is going to do very well.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
Oh yeah.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
Yeah.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
Yeah.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
I mean, it's a Mario game.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
It is not going to do not well.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.240
Um, and then they're also releasing a special edition switch.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.240
Well, it's not even special edition.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.400
I think it's the red switch that they had a while back with Odyssey.

20:48.400 --> 20:53.200
Um, they're releasing it again now with wonder in there as well.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.720
Um, so neat.

20:55.720 --> 21:02.400
Uh, and then last but not least, uh, volition has been shut down because the embracer group,

21:02.400 --> 21:08.160
you know, as part of their restructuring since they don't have that $2 billion of cash in,

21:08.160 --> 21:16.200
you know, being pumped into their business, they have decided to, um, shut down volition,

21:16.200 --> 21:22.360
which um, yeah, I guess that's sad that volition is shutting down, but I mean, is it the same

21:22.360 --> 21:25.320
volition that made some of the earlier saints row games?

21:25.320 --> 21:26.320
No.

21:26.320 --> 21:32.920
Also, I kind of feel that, you know, being that volition was at a point where they set,

21:32.920 --> 21:36.840
you know, fans were giving them feedback on the game and I get it.

21:36.840 --> 21:40.360
Like fans could be terrible sometimes when it comes to games, but like if everybody's

21:40.360 --> 21:44.520
saying the same thing, like this game looks like it's awful.

21:44.520 --> 21:48.480
I don't like the idea of these main characters just being college kids that are trying to

21:48.480 --> 21:51.360
pay off student loans and then they turn to a life of crime.

21:51.360 --> 21:56.440
That sounds really stupid and not gangsta, um, you know, maybe take that feedback.

21:56.440 --> 22:01.080
It would be like the equivalent of say, for example, the Sonic movie.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.680
If they release ugly Sonic in the trailers, everyone's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.680
This seems bad.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.680
They're like, Oh, that's good.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.160
We're, we're going to keep it like this.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.600
It's better this way.

22:09.600 --> 22:14.320
Like and then being surprised what no one went to the box office to see her awful movie.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.420
I am shocked.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.360
And that's kind of what we have here with saints row.

22:18.360 --> 22:23.480
It was just, it was an awful game premise wise and then awfully executed.

22:23.480 --> 22:29.800
It was like the perfect storm of awfulness and not even in a fun way, like a Bethesda

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
way.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.760
Questbuster in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.120
I don't remember if I gave the plug.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.160
We do tape live Sunday nights, of course, at nine Eastern six Pacific over at Twitch

22:38.160 --> 22:42.920
TV slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show and a Questbuster says, Volition

22:42.920 --> 22:47.520
news is sad, but after agents of mayhem in 2017, there were questions on what was going

22:47.520 --> 22:48.920
to happen with the studio.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.360
And that's like, Loki, that's kind of got the vibe I got from your opinion because at

22:52.360 --> 22:56.640
first I was like, Oh, Loki's going to probably be really sad because this is the studio that

22:56.640 --> 22:58.640
made those earlier saints road games.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.600
But then you were kind of like the same studio anymore.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.600
Yeah, exactly.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.920
They've been going downhill for years.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.920
So you were unfortunate.

23:04.920 --> 23:09.960
It's unfortunate because like, you know, one of the big champions of like kind of the,

23:09.960 --> 23:12.480
the core saints row games was idle Ninja.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.200
And unfortunately when he passed, it was just any hope that we had left for the studio was

23:16.200 --> 23:19.240
just it died with them, unfortunately.

23:19.240 --> 23:23.280
And it's sad because you would hope that there are people that kind of want to bring that

23:23.280 --> 23:24.280
back.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.280
And I get it.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.280
Like they were in a tough position.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.160
Like they had gone way too wacky with Saints Row.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.400
It was just like off the rails crazy at that point.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.400
They could have dialed it back.

23:33.400 --> 23:37.840
I mean, the whole fact that this is a reboot means you can dial it back to that earlier

23:37.840 --> 23:38.840
game.

23:38.840 --> 23:42.960
Just all you had to do was recreate the kind of sandbox environment that you have the original

23:42.960 --> 23:43.960
game.

23:43.960 --> 23:49.000
And it's sort of, you know, mentality is to add a solid story with the earlier games.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.040
And it had that grit on it.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.460
This has no grit on it.

23:52.460 --> 23:56.200
This is basically stupid characters that nobody likes.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.900
And even worse, like when you actually play through the game, and you actually listen

23:59.900 --> 24:05.480
to your character, like you hate them even more like that is poor writing.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.680
It's poor writing, poor execution, poor everything.

24:08.680 --> 24:13.080
And even on top of all that, like after all of that was done, they publish the game, they

24:13.080 --> 24:17.280
still have the gall to put out DLC.

24:17.280 --> 24:26.180
That was about larping like, I'm sorry, larping in a gangster, you know, sandbox game.

24:26.180 --> 24:27.240
What the hell is that?

24:27.240 --> 24:28.840
Like it makes no sense whatsoever.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.800
And they just kept doubling and tripling down on this stuff.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.720
So yeah, they had it coming.

24:33.720 --> 24:34.780
I'm sorry.

24:34.780 --> 24:39.120
But like, if you keep making bad decisions over and over and over again, you're not going

24:39.120 --> 24:41.760
to be operating anymore.

24:41.760 --> 24:48.160
It sure was interesting how Saints Row showed up on PlayStation Plus, like, a day after

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
this announcement.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.160
You know what I mean?

24:50.160 --> 24:54.200
Plus, wasn't this announcement tied with something like they really tried to sneak this announcement

24:54.200 --> 24:56.660
out there like people would notice.

24:56.660 --> 25:03.040
Like I want to say it came out the same time as like, either it was on it released on steam

25:03.040 --> 25:07.520
to like the game released on steam shortly before the seems wrong to the volition news

25:07.520 --> 25:12.360
about the closure that they time that very strange.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.360
I don't know.

25:13.360 --> 25:17.640
And then I mean, I feel bad for the people that worked for volition.

25:17.640 --> 25:23.240
But at the same time, like, like, I'm sorry, some accountability needs to be had like,

25:23.240 --> 25:27.720
like, yeah, I it feels bad for any developer to close down and the people that are affected

25:27.720 --> 25:28.720
by that.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.000
Like, because there are a lot of people that like that they were just doing what they're

25:31.000 --> 25:33.860
told and like making the best thing they could do it.

25:33.860 --> 25:37.140
But someone in the chain screwed that up big time.

25:37.140 --> 25:39.020
And I think is more than just like a few people.

25:39.020 --> 25:42.260
It was a lot of people that really screwed the pooch on that one.

25:42.260 --> 25:45.180
So I don't know.

25:45.180 --> 25:48.620
Quest Buster pointing out in our chat volition had some great titles in their history, red

25:48.620 --> 25:52.040
faction, the free space, space, Sims and descent.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.820
But as Loki pointed out, most of the people that came with those likely left.

25:55.820 --> 25:56.820
Yeah, exactly.

25:56.820 --> 26:01.540
And red faction, free space and all that stuff, like, if they would put out more of those

26:01.540 --> 26:05.160
games, like I would have loved to see, like, hey, I have an idea.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.700
If you don't know what to do with Saints Row, then don't do anything with it.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.400
Create a new red faction game and do that like you could have taken that.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.360
Well, I mean, it still may have been bad, but you could have at least taken red faction

26:16.360 --> 26:21.160
and like been able to stick with the space stuff and have an action game based off that.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.640
And that would probably have been more successful than this was.

26:23.640 --> 26:26.280
But they just.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.160
I don't know what they were thinking with this, honestly, because like after we saw

26:30.160 --> 26:34.400
the first really is like, oh, and then after we learned more about the characters, like,

26:34.440 --> 26:37.200
oh, no, no, no, no.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.280
They just kept going with that.

26:39.480 --> 26:42.040
They know like, oh, hey, we're listening to you.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.540
We're taking your feedback. It's like, no.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.920
Goes straight up with what we're doing.

26:46.920 --> 26:51.000
All right. Well, I guess it's one of those things where it's it's

26:51.840 --> 26:53.540
it's a shock, but it's not a shock, right?

26:53.540 --> 26:56.140
It's like, oh, my gosh, they really did close the studio.

26:56.140 --> 26:59.000
And then you go, well, you look at what happened in seven years.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.840
It's not that surprising.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.380
Like the caveat with this, though, is volitions gone.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.760
But that doesn't mean the Saints license is dead.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.180
You can give it to another studio and they can start from scratch.

27:09.380 --> 27:12.940
And I want to say that I thought Gearbox was going to be doing something

27:13.440 --> 27:17.180
maybe with it, but like give it to somebody that like Gearbox,

27:17.640 --> 27:21.400
like whether you like Borderlands or, you know, some of that stuff,

27:21.400 --> 27:25.860
they have pretty good writers that understand context

27:25.860 --> 27:29.280
and understand humor and understand all that stuff instead of just like

27:29.280 --> 27:32.660
making fart jokes all the time like that. It's just awful.

27:32.660 --> 27:34.100
It's bad writing.

27:34.100 --> 27:38.740
And I just think that those folks would have a better time

27:38.740 --> 27:41.500
with something like this because they can have fun with it.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.460
They know how to make a solid engine.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.960
They know how to make a solid game.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.620
Like let somebody competent take it.

27:48.620 --> 27:52.720
All right. Well, that about covers some of the big headlines

27:52.720 --> 27:56.420
we missed from our week off, but we still have to get to this week's headlines.

27:56.680 --> 27:57.840
So we'll get to that shortly.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.300
But first, we're going to get into our gaming weeks

28:00.320 --> 28:02.700
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week

28:02.700 --> 28:04.700
or in the last two weeks, I suppose.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.120
So let's kick it off. How was your gaming week?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.920
We'll go to Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

28:10.540 --> 28:12.160
It was all right.

28:14.000 --> 28:14.960
What did I play?

28:14.960 --> 28:19.800
I played Cult of the Lamb today to show it off to a friend.

28:22.140 --> 28:27.180
I played, of course, I finished through all of the individual scenarios

28:27.180 --> 28:28.680
for Live Alive.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.480
So I'm actually into like the main part of the end game.

28:34.700 --> 28:40.200
And everything has just frozen on me all of a sudden.

28:43.540 --> 28:44.280
Hello?

28:44.280 --> 28:47.340
I'm here. Sorry, I did notice your avatar is frozen.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.120
Yeah, I don't I don't know what happened.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.160
Just a bunch of stuff decided to freeze on me.

28:52.160 --> 29:00.500
So, but at any rate, I've also we got Godzilla pinball temporarily.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.500
So we did a little momentary trade for that.

29:05.500 --> 29:11.000
Also, we got Galactic Tank Force, which is amazing and cheeseball.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.920
And like the whole readout part of it is like watching a Sega CD game.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.220
It's pretty it's pretty, pretty rad.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.380
That sounds cool. I don't even know what it is.

29:21.140 --> 29:23.980
Yeah, well, you guys are welcome to come over and play.

29:23.980 --> 29:26.280
I'll see about finding some pictures.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.280
Of course, Dead by Daylight and Disney Dreamlight Valley.

29:30.280 --> 29:34.580
The Godzilla table, though, that is more fun than I thought it was going to be.

29:34.580 --> 29:36.880
And I'm not even kidding.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.880
So, yeah, it's cool.

29:39.880 --> 29:44.380
And of course, it ends in the Go Godzilla!

29:44.380 --> 29:46.380
You know, when you're done with your game.

29:46.380 --> 29:49.380
Still playing Weird Al.

29:50.380 --> 29:58.380
And my stupid wordscape game that I'm I'm feeling angry in a certain way about because.

29:58.380 --> 30:02.380
It just it takes money out of me and I don't want it to happen.

30:02.380 --> 30:04.380
That table looks awesome. I like it.

30:04.380 --> 30:09.380
I like I like the whole like vintage sci-fi stuff.

30:09.380 --> 30:11.380
Yeah, it's awesome.

30:11.380 --> 30:14.380
But no, it's it's it's super, it's super good.

30:14.380 --> 30:18.380
Does the table that you guys have, do you have the tank treads on the side?

30:19.380 --> 30:20.380
We do not.

30:20.380 --> 30:27.380
And actually, the thing is, is that it comes with like a big cannon that attaches to the back of the table, you know, in the back glass area.

30:27.380 --> 30:30.380
And when you fold it down, it looks like the tank.

30:30.380 --> 30:38.380
I don't know if that's like my jam or not, but it's it's it's a pretty sweet, pretty sweet setup.

30:38.380 --> 30:41.380
And for the record, I'm relaunching all of my camera stuff.

30:41.380 --> 30:51.380
So but anyway, I I really, really have just been all over both of these tables.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.380
There's so much fun.

30:53.380 --> 31:02.380
And I I played a little bit of.

31:02.380 --> 31:10.380
What was it? It was I don't remember what it was I played it was it was something that I was trying out, but I did buy Baldur's Gate 3.

31:11.380 --> 31:17.380
Because the Mac version is going to officially be out right now.

31:17.380 --> 31:25.380
The version that you can play is is the last build for it, like of the betas before they released it.

31:25.380 --> 31:33.380
So I'm I'm feeling feeling pretty, pretty OK about it.

31:33.380 --> 31:38.380
OK, I think I see what's happening with my camera.

31:38.380 --> 31:48.380
It's. It's just I mean, there's so much stuff for me to play at my house now that I don't even know, like.

31:48.380 --> 32:00.380
What else to play, I have to we've organized the game room now and and I'm really hoping that we can actually get the whole classic game set up back again.

32:00.380 --> 32:06.380
So I'm looking forward to to making the best out of that.

32:06.380 --> 32:11.380
But right now, it's just been my usual and a lot of pinball.

32:11.380 --> 32:16.380
All right. Loki, how about you? I know you've been working on a video, but anything else you gave me?

32:16.380 --> 32:20.380
No, I was editing the entire time, unfortunately.

32:20.380 --> 32:24.380
So I did play Minecraft, but in the sense that I was using it to edit.

32:24.380 --> 32:28.380
Gotcha. So, yeah, it was it was only that, unfortunately.

32:28.380 --> 32:36.380
It's been busy now, I noticed through the social media is that like the the Minecraft championship not rising is happening soon, right?

32:36.380 --> 32:47.380
Because I've seen some of the program this weekend because I've interacted with posts when you were doing it now, like reading replies and stuff that now it pushes all that stuff to my for you page, which I try not to read, but like always defaults to that.

32:47.380 --> 32:49.380
I can't help but see some of it, you know.

32:49.380 --> 32:59.380
So I just I thought the other thought of you, they have a Canon event this weekend on the 16th at noon Pacific.

32:59.380 --> 33:14.380
And then there's a special thing that they're doing in collaboration with Twitch rivals at TwitchCon that they're doing an in-person Minecraft MCC thing, although it's supposed to be different, though.

33:14.380 --> 33:20.380
That's non-canon. I think it's with fewer players, so I'm not sure what they're doing with that, but that'll be interesting, too.

33:20.380 --> 33:25.380
I almost want to go to TwitchCon for that, but I can't because it's too soon.

33:25.380 --> 33:30.380
I will get B-roll for you or Jamie will, because I it's in our both our plans.

33:30.380 --> 33:36.380
So, yeah, maybe that might be something that's five weeks away.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.380
TwitchCon, I can't.

33:37.380 --> 33:42.380
Yeah, that would be something to look forward to maybe next year or something like that.

33:42.380 --> 33:44.380
Yeah, would be cool.

33:44.380 --> 33:46.380
All right, well, my gaming week.

33:46.380 --> 33:54.380
So obviously I was busy with travel to Dragon Con and doing the convention, but, you know, they had a nice arcade there at the convention.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.380
So it was it was cool.

33:56.380 --> 34:01.380
They kind of had two vendors that were merged together into one long arcade.

34:01.380 --> 34:05.380
They had the joystick game bar, which is like classic games.

34:05.380 --> 34:07.380
I'm trying to remember what I played in the classic arcade.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.380
Oh, Mortal Kombat 2.

34:08.380 --> 34:14.380
I remember playing that because I still I still remember Katana's fatality block, block, block, block, block.

34:14.380 --> 34:17.380
High kick is easy, easy fatality.

34:17.380 --> 34:21.380
And I was I was doing that because I'm a one trick pony with those fatalities in that game.

34:21.380 --> 34:23.380
So I was playing a little bit of that.

34:23.380 --> 34:28.380
And the save point was the group that brought the import games.

34:28.380 --> 34:36.380
They actually had a working Technica machine, which I hadn't seen in a while, so I could actually play Flee, which is my favorite song in Technica.

34:36.380 --> 34:40.380
And they they they also had a space Harrier machine.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.380
So I thought of Jamie again.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.380
I didn't take a picture this time because somebody was playing it when I walked by it.

34:44.380 --> 34:48.380
But yeah, I saw that.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.380
Wait, YYR?

34:50.380 --> 34:54.380
That was literally your machine I was playing?

34:54.380 --> 34:56.380
That is funny or used to be.

34:56.380 --> 34:57.380
I guess that's funny.

34:57.380 --> 34:58.380
Oh, wow.

34:58.380 --> 34:59.380
What a small world.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.380
OK, well, thanks YYR.

35:01.380 --> 35:06.380
So your your arcade machine got to Dragon Con before you did.

35:06.380 --> 35:08.380
I want you to think about that for a minute.

35:08.380 --> 35:10.380
I'm just I'm just messing.

35:10.380 --> 35:12.380
But that's cool that I played that.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.380
But yeah, they had a lot of other like dance games.

35:14.380 --> 35:18.380
Obviously, the dance games were super popular and people were lining up for them.

35:18.380 --> 35:21.380
And, you know, I've played plenty of dance games in my time.

35:21.380 --> 35:30.380
I finally ponied up the money to get the Nintendo expansion pack for Nintendo Switch online because I finally just wanted to play some of the Game Boy Advance games.

35:30.380 --> 35:40.380
And I played a lot of Mario Advance and Mario Advance 2, which is actually Super Mario 2 is the original Advance and the Super Mario World is Advance 2.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.380
And I was playing a little bit of that.

35:42.380 --> 35:44.380
So that was a lot of fun.

35:44.380 --> 35:45.380
I played on that.

35:45.380 --> 35:50.380
And then when I got back, boy oh boy, there's just been games coming out left and right.

35:50.380 --> 35:53.380
So like Dark Sakura, I have picked up Baldur's Gate 3.

35:53.380 --> 35:57.380
I haven't played it yet, though, but that's coming this next week.

35:57.380 --> 36:03.380
You all know the individual in my life that can talk me into buying a game so that we can play it together.

36:03.380 --> 36:06.380
He's very good at convincing people to do things.

36:06.380 --> 36:09.380
So please look forward to that.

36:09.380 --> 36:17.380
And also, in addition to that, I picked up Starfield since that is, you know, of course, on Game Pass.

36:17.380 --> 36:23.380
I think many of you were doing what I was doing this week and checking out Starfield, my Game Pass subscription.

36:23.380 --> 36:25.380
It was weird.

36:25.380 --> 36:29.380
I wasn't sure how I felt about Starfield at first.

36:29.380 --> 36:37.380
I was a little bit, you know, especially coming from something like No Man's Sky, which is like relatively simple exploration and very chill.

36:37.380 --> 36:43.380
Like there's a lot more stuff and micromanagy types of things.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.380
It's a Bethesda game, right?

36:45.380 --> 36:46.380
It's a Bethesda game.

36:46.380 --> 36:49.380
And you have to think about how much you're carrying.

36:49.380 --> 36:55.380
When you're setting up the bases, do you have the material the right way to do this and farming stuff?

36:55.380 --> 36:58.380
And what really bothered me was the space flight.

36:58.380 --> 37:04.380
I did not care for the space flight and how much was going into that as opposed to No Man's Sky.

37:04.380 --> 37:11.380
Now, granted, the game will let you kind of skip a lot of space flight after the tutorial because you can just fast travel to different places.

37:11.380 --> 37:14.380
So that is nice.

37:14.380 --> 37:16.380
They do put some quality of life things in there.

37:16.380 --> 37:23.380
So like I said, I wasn't quite sure I was feeling the game at first, but I really sat down with it.

37:23.380 --> 37:30.380
And there was some point where, and again, I'm trying to keep it light on spoilers, but you get a companion pretty early on in the game.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.380
And she wants to go do this certain mission.

37:33.380 --> 37:37.380
And you're in our solar system that we know today.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.380
They call it in the game Sol, S-O-L.

37:39.380 --> 37:45.380
But it's the solar system we know today, except something has happened to Earth.

37:45.380 --> 37:52.380
It looks like a big desert now, which probably is just a commentary on climate change and all of that because that's probably more likely than you think.

37:52.380 --> 37:55.380
But nobody lives on it anymore.

37:55.380 --> 38:03.380
But you get to go to the moon and your companion actually says, if you want to go land on the moon and just play around a little bit,

38:03.380 --> 38:06.380
which is funny because other people I talked to, I guess, didn't get this dialogue option.

38:06.380 --> 38:14.380
But because I went diplomat, I think I get maybe some expanded options and maybe I'm not picking the same things in the dialogue tree that some of you are doing.

38:14.380 --> 38:17.380
So she said, yeah, if you want to go down to the moon, we could do it.

38:17.380 --> 38:21.380
It didn't pop it up, but it's just a suggestion she made. It didn't pop a new quest or anything.

38:21.380 --> 38:24.380
So I went down to the moon. I landed in a very random spot.

38:24.380 --> 38:30.380
And then I was just, oh, there's Bobby, there was no, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I have no moon landing spots.

38:30.380 --> 38:32.380
Neither did I. I just picked one.

38:32.380 --> 38:35.380
I just said, we're going to land here and did it.

38:35.380 --> 38:41.380
And I went to a very random moon base that was probably procedurally generated.

38:41.380 --> 38:47.380
I picked up a quest from some humans that wanted me to go blast some pirates nearby to heaven.

38:47.380 --> 38:56.380
And I went and explored this base for like 90 minutes because I couldn't, I didn't, I thought this room had a window over it.

38:56.380 --> 39:00.380
And it turns out it wasn't. You could actually jump through the window.

39:00.380 --> 39:03.380
And so I ran around in circles for like 30 minutes trying to figure this out.

39:03.380 --> 39:08.380
But once I figured it out, I was like, okay, that actually did feel very rewarding.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.380
And that was kind of neat.

39:10.380 --> 39:20.380
So I feel like the game is growing on me more, but I just, I get like the overwhelming analysis paralysis that comes with a lot of Bethesda games.

39:20.380 --> 39:24.380
When it's like, there's a table over here and there's crafting you can do here.

39:24.380 --> 39:30.380
And there's all these things you can pick up here, but don't pick up too much because you'll be weighted down and lose oxygen faster.

39:30.380 --> 39:39.380
But I guess there's, there's plenty of places you can transfer inventory to like your companion or the ship, but it's, it's a lot.

39:39.380 --> 39:46.380
But overall, like it's growing on me and my impressions of Starfield are favorable, but it just took me a minute to get there.

39:46.380 --> 39:49.380
So that's kind of where I'm at with that game.

39:49.380 --> 39:57.380
One other game I want to talk about, which again, just a random thing that came out in the last couple of weeks that I think for a lot of you is probably going to be blink and you miss it.

39:57.380 --> 40:02.380
And I'm going to mention this game and you're going to say, oh yeah, that did come out.

40:02.380 --> 40:05.380
Watch your, watch your, watch your reaction. Here we go.

40:05.380 --> 40:10.380
So I also checked out this week, the digital eclipse.

40:10.380 --> 40:25.380
I think they call it gold series look back of the making of Karateka, which the making of Karateka is all about the 1980s Apple II game Karateka, which was ported to the Commodore 64.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.380
So they, you know, it's, it's very well known for that too.

40:27.380 --> 40:30.380
And it was ported to the Atari, one of the early Ataris as well.

40:30.380 --> 40:32.380
And they actually ported it to some other things too.

40:32.380 --> 40:33.380
The game does get into this.

40:33.380 --> 40:44.380
So it's set up similarly to Atari 50 and that they have all these old letters you can read and they have documentary style videos that are spliced in that you can watch.

40:44.380 --> 40:51.380
And they do some really cool things because the whole thing with Karateka and why it was important.

40:51.380 --> 40:55.380
Well, funny enough, fifth dream in chat says, does that tell how it's actually pronounced now?

40:56.380 --> 40:58.380
LOL. Yes and no.

40:58.380 --> 41:01.380
So there actually is a video that directly addresses this.

41:01.380 --> 41:08.380
And the creator of the game, Jordan, comes up and says, I call it Karateka.

41:08.380 --> 41:09.380
That's what I always called it.

41:09.380 --> 41:13.380
He says, but apparently everybody else called it Karateka.

41:13.380 --> 41:17.380
And he says, and actually, if you go to Japan, there is no emphasis on any syllable.

41:17.380 --> 41:26.380
And most people in Japan called it Karateka, something like that is all like what they would say there.

41:26.380 --> 41:34.380
So he says at the end of the day, well, he says, at the end of the day, I really don't care which one you use.

41:34.380 --> 41:36.380
They're all correct to me. Thank you for playing the game.

41:36.380 --> 41:38.380
That's basically what he says.

41:38.380 --> 41:44.380
So he, which is what I wish the gift guy would have done quite honestly, but it is what it is.

41:44.380 --> 41:49.380
So he has said he accepts all pronunciations of the game and that is the official answer.

41:49.380 --> 41:56.380
So I just say Karateka because that's just, but it's funny because they interview professionals and other developers and things.

41:56.380 --> 42:00.380
And there is somebody in the video who says, well, I just always thought it was karate and then kah.

42:00.380 --> 42:02.380
So I always say Karateka and I was like that.

42:02.380 --> 42:03.380
That's it. Same brain.

42:03.380 --> 42:05.380
That's where my brain always went when I was younger.

42:05.380 --> 42:07.380
So, yeah.

42:07.380 --> 42:11.380
So that was that was it was neat that it answered questions like that.

42:11.380 --> 42:20.380
But some other neat modes is that like the whole reason why it was infamous in gaming was that it was really a step forward for cinematic games.

42:20.380 --> 42:26.380
And the way this is all laid out and the story that it tells in the game really lays that out.

42:26.380 --> 42:30.380
And it's because Jordan used a and I'm not remember his last name in the minute.

42:30.380 --> 42:34.380
Belkner? I might be getting that wrong. I'm very sorry.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.380
He's also the same guy that made Prince of Persia.

42:36.380 --> 42:46.380
Meckner. Thank you. Jordan Meckner made the game and he used a trick that old Disney animators used in Snow White called rotoscoping.

42:46.380 --> 42:51.380
So he actually shot his dad filming different karate things.

42:51.380 --> 42:59.380
He had a karate teacher do some stuff, but they didn't have that actual Super 8 film footage, but they had his dad climbing up onto the hood of the car.

42:59.380 --> 43:06.380
And they showed how that actually became the protagonist climbing up the cliff in the first scene of the game.

43:06.380 --> 43:14.380
And they used rotoscoping, which is basically putting traceable paper over the Super 8 footage one frame at a time to basically make the sprites and clean that up.

43:14.380 --> 43:16.380
And that's why that game was so fluid.

43:16.380 --> 43:26.380
But they also talk about other ways that that game became more cinematic and it talks about how Choplifter was very inspiring and making the more cinematic.

43:26.380 --> 43:38.380
It really tells the story about how he did these earlier games. He was trying to sell a game called Death Bounce, which was essentially, long story short, an asteroid clone.

43:38.380 --> 43:43.380
Copy copy, like just refined, refined, refined to its whole new thing that he just really wasn't able to sell to Broderbund.

43:43.380 --> 43:48.380
And he just kind of had an awakening when he played Choplifter. He said, Why am I trying to make an arcade game?

43:48.380 --> 43:54.380
Video games now because they are on computers and you own them, they can be cinematic experiences.

43:54.380 --> 43:59.380
And so he decided he was going to make a cinematic game. And that's where Karateka came from.

43:59.380 --> 44:03.380
And how he ended up making that game.

44:03.380 --> 44:10.380
And then at the very end, it kind of teases that like, Prince of Persia was the next game, but that's another story.

44:10.380 --> 44:15.380
Wink wink nudge, like the series might explore that as well in the future.

44:15.380 --> 44:19.380
Yeah, Bobby points out he wanted a game that ended with the end and not game over.

44:19.380 --> 44:26.380
But anyway, the making of Karateka does a very good job because you can play like they talk about all of these prototypes.

44:26.380 --> 44:32.380
And if you want to play the very original prototype that Jordan Meckner sent to Broderbund, you can play that prototype.

44:32.380 --> 44:39.380
If you want to play his asteroid clone that he made, you can play that. If you want to play Death Bounce, you can play that.

44:39.380 --> 44:47.380
And then they actually did reimagined. So digital clips made reimagined versions of Death Bounce and Karateka.

44:47.380 --> 44:53.380
And they're both very good for reimagined games. I know digital clips has been in the game for a while.

44:53.380 --> 44:59.380
But whoever worked on those reimagines, especially the Death Bounce reimagining, because that game never was released technically.

44:59.380 --> 45:07.380
Because they just didn't see a releasable, well, they saw a releasable game in it, but they wanted to make all these changes that Jordan didn't really want to do.

45:07.380 --> 45:13.380
So you can go in and play that. And I thought the remastered Death Bounce was really cool.

45:13.380 --> 45:18.380
And yeah, Bobby points out, you can actually watch somebody else play the game and jump in at any point.

45:18.380 --> 45:29.380
There's apparently 14 different games in there. But it's when I say different games, it's like 10 of them are Karateka and two of them are Death Bounce and two of them are the asteroid clones.

45:29.380 --> 45:34.380
So it's really just a handful. But you can play the Commodore 64 clone.

45:34.380 --> 45:46.380
And they actually have the developer of the 64 version of Karateka named I think Veda Cook is her name, which she's trans.

45:46.380 --> 45:51.380
And so she's not credited appropriately in the old version of the game.

45:51.380 --> 45:56.380
So I was surprised that they did not go back and fix that in the Commodore 64 version of the game.

45:56.380 --> 46:02.380
But perhaps they couldn't at this point. I don't know what happened to the source code. It could be lost to time or something of that.

46:02.380 --> 46:14.380
But I thought it was very cool because she explains her relationship with Jordan, and how she was basically handpicked to do the Commodore 64 port and the Atari port, which I thought it was just a really good story.

46:14.380 --> 46:21.380
So there's lots of really good stories. The way it was all laid out like a museum, I really enjoyed as well. It was really like an interactive museum.

46:21.380 --> 46:28.380
So anyway, I know I'm talking a lot about this game. And you know, Bobby and I've talked about maybe doing a deeper dive video for the network later on.

46:28.380 --> 46:37.380
So I should save some thoughts for that. But I will just say I was I was very impressed by this. And for 20 bucks. It's not a bad deal. I'm gonna be honest.

46:37.380 --> 46:45.380
I don't I did play Karateka on the Commodore 64. I didn't like it as a kid. I thought it was too hard. I thought it was too difficult. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

46:45.380 --> 47:00.380
And I thought it was too difficult. They never got very far. But going through this experience gave me an appreciation of like, Oh, okay, I see why like this is important. I see how this got to this and gaming.

47:00.380 --> 47:07.380
And the fact that you know, the museum element, the documentary stuff kind of told its own story, I thought was really well done.

47:07.380 --> 47:17.380
Now I do have some places I would give constructive feedback. But I'll save that for another time because I've talked about this long enough. But I think there's there's some parts that were glossed over a little bit for me.

47:17.380 --> 47:36.380
And I'm just wondering if it was a rights issue or what, because, okay, I'll quickly say he made another game that they mentioned and they show a couple screenshots of but I really felt like that game seemed like a bridge on how he was able to design the cinematic stuff that he made.

47:36.380 --> 47:50.380
And they don't really ever get into much detail about that. I thought that was a little weird. But maybe it's a rights issue. Maybe you know, because it belonged to another company. I don't know. But I just overall I mean, the issues I have with it are pretty nitpicky.

47:50.380 --> 48:04.380
And for a first release in a goldmaster series. I'm really curious what other games they've got lined up, because they call it number one. It's even on the logo of the game goldmaster number one. So you know, they've got a queue of other games they're going to do.

48:04.380 --> 48:29.380
Now, I can theorize a guess what some of the other games could be Prince of Persia is an obvious one. However, I thought it was interesting. They interview john Tobias from Mortal Kombat. I'm not sure why they're interviewing I mean, maybe because he also made a martial arts game. But what if you were interviewing him for something else? And you just decided to ask a few questions about karateka as well.

48:29.380 --> 48:57.380
By the way, I if they do if they I don't know, again, right. So just if they were to do one for the original Mortal Kombat, because you know, all that motion cap stuff is out there. We were talking about this with Dragon Con last year, one of the panels that Bobby got to do. There was some behind the scenes footage of them doing the mocap that they actually showed that had like never been seen before. And you know, when I kind of put that together with what I was watching in the karateka thing, I was like, Oh, fuck, I hope that I hope Mortal Kombat one is like their next museum thing.

48:57.380 --> 49:18.380
Because that would be incredible. Again, I don't know how rights issues would play into that. So it is a pie in the sky thought that would be amazing. I also noticed they had somebody from ID software, also seemingly randomly interviewed, who happened to be showing off a five and a quarter floppy with return or return to Castle Wolfenstein on it. And I was like, hmm.

49:18.380 --> 49:47.380
That would be cool Castle Wolfenstein 3d could be a very interesting one. So anyway, all my all my thought is, is like, I hope there are more. So I do do check this out. If this sounds appealing to you, and show digital clips and the folks that are involved that we are wanting more of these because I thought it was well done. And I'm really excited for the potential of some of these other things. Again, I am completely making educated guesses based on what I'm doing.

49:49.040 --> 50:18.260
These seem to be random people being grabbed for an interview, but maybe it's not that random. But we'll see. We'll see. Fifth Dream in chat says just do every game for real. No, but really, though, like, there's probably a lot of other deep cuts, I would have never thought of to do this, you know, I would have never thought I needed a look back at karateka. Just like I said, when I was a kid, I didn't know better. I didn't have the appreciation for games that I do now. I didn't care for it. And so I haven't thought about it

50:18.260 --> 50:47.860
since. But thanks to this experience, I've kind of gone, oh, wow. Like I this is okay. I get why this game was important. I get the impact that it had on other people. And I get the story about this. And I mean, I think that says it all right there on why they wanted to do this in the first place. So alright, that's plenty for me. I've talked a lot about that game. So but I had a feeling a lot of you would be like, oh, yeah, that came out. Just reminding you because don't don't miss it. We want to see more in this

50:47.860 --> 51:17.660
series. I think we really do. It is out on switch PC and PlayStation. I'm not sure about Xbox question marks, somebody would have to fact check that and verify. I picked it up on PS five personally. Because I was just like, I like my PS five. And I thought trophies might be fun. And I unlocked like two trophies. So sadly, no trophy for getting 100% on the museum. I thought for sure that would be a thing, but that's all right. Okay, let's move on and get into some of the

51:17.660 --> 51:25.740
other gaming news from this week. Loki, we will go over to you. Oh, thank you. Why? Why are who says yes, it's on Xbox. Thank you. Okay, yeah, Loki.

51:25.740 --> 51:55.740
Yeah, so let's talk about PlayStation Plus, since you know, Saints Row just recently was added to that as well. It's getting more expensive, because you know, that's what happens nowadays, everything just gets more expensive, for no discernible reason whatsoever. But they're going to be breaking down, or they're going to be raising the prices across the board for each of the different tiers, and some even more expensive than $20. So right now, we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about

51:55.740 --> 52:25.740
PlayStation Plus, and we're going

52:25.740 --> 52:55.740
to be talking

52:55.740 --> 53:25.740
about PlayStation Plus.

53:25.740 --> 53:55.740
So

53:55.740 --> 54:25.740
if

54:25.740 --> 54:55.740
you

54:55.740 --> 55:25.740
have

55:25.740 --> 55:55.740
a

55:55.740 --> 56:11.820
game pass ultimate, like that's $17 a month US, that ends up being $204 a year. That's a lot. I mean,

56:12.620 --> 56:19.020
when you break it down like that, that is quite a bit, that's more than what Sony's service is, but

56:19.020 --> 56:24.220
like, I don't know, it just doesn't seem that bad to me, and maybe if you like break it down,

56:24.380 --> 56:29.500
$70 game right now, I only have to do that three times through the year to technically get the

56:29.500 --> 56:36.540
value out of it, right? That's true. Yeah, that's what it is. I think so. And I mean, from what I

56:36.540 --> 56:41.260
understand with Sony service is they're not putting their first party games on there right

56:41.260 --> 56:46.540
away. They're not day and date with launches, if I'm correct, because they want you to buy those

56:46.540 --> 56:50.300
because they feel that their games are worth the money, and they want you to pay the money,

56:50.860 --> 56:54.700
even though you pay for their service, but they want you to buy it upfront. And then later on,

56:54.700 --> 56:59.020
if they're gracious enough, they'll give it to you for free. And to be fair, I would say Sony

56:59.020 --> 57:04.620
is probably worth the money, but so are the things that Microsoft is putting out, you know? Exactly.

57:04.620 --> 57:11.820
So yeah. Shane is in our chat. Chad Leland says, I actually canceled my renewal because their

57:11.820 --> 57:16.940
justification of the increase is pathetic and vastly overstated the quality of their offerings.

57:16.940 --> 57:23.100
No more online games or extra games. I'm tired of arrogant Sony this generation. That last sentence

57:23.820 --> 57:30.700
says a lot. And I think I agree with it a lot is that is I'm also tired of arrogant Sony this

57:30.700 --> 57:37.820
generation. And I don't like to root for people getting L's in the gaming industry because I know

57:37.820 --> 57:43.420
a lot of people get affected by that. I don't like to say such sweeping things. It's like,

57:43.420 --> 57:48.220
everybody there ought to be fired. That's not how we really feel. And I know that like you

57:48.220 --> 57:52.860
were saying earlier during the Volition story, people that didn't make the decisions on where

57:52.860 --> 57:59.660
to go with the story were impacted by the game. And that's too bad. But there comes a point where

57:59.660 --> 58:07.980
I'm like, you know what? When the PSVR2 flops, I'm not going to be sad for Sony. Well, the way I see

58:07.980 --> 58:14.380
it like this is desperation breeds innovation. Because if they're put in last place, like they

58:14.380 --> 58:20.700
were with like PlayStation 3, they tried harder when PlayStation 4 came out. That's when we got

58:20.700 --> 58:26.380
LittleBigPlanet and like some really rad games, right? So like, yeah, I think Sony should feel

58:26.380 --> 58:32.220
the heat a little bit. And it's I'm not sure they learned from what happened with the PS3.

58:32.220 --> 58:39.340
Because this is this carries a very similar weight to the phrase 599 US dollars.

58:41.660 --> 58:46.060
It doesn't make it because like, they're consoles expensive. They're like, like,

58:46.060 --> 58:52.700
just even the proposition of PlayStation VR right now, like, I've completely just given up any sort

58:52.700 --> 58:58.940
of hope to actually play you know, that my wonderful spiritual successor to Until Dawn

58:58.940 --> 59:05.100
Rush of Blood, because I'm not buying the system and the VR for like, was it gonna be

59:05.100 --> 59:12.940
close to $1,000 at that point, like, oh, thanks, I'm good, you know. And I just will skip Sony this

59:12.940 --> 59:18.140
generation. And honestly, like, considering how much I play my Xbox, which is not at all,

59:18.140 --> 59:24.140
it's in a box. I'll just skip consoles this next generation too, because PCs the way they go,

59:24.140 --> 59:29.580
like, I get the best of everything, I get all of the games, none of this BS about paying for

59:29.580 --> 59:33.820
multiplayer online. And like, if they start pulling this, I'm like, okay, well, I'll just

59:33.820 --> 59:37.340
play thousands of other games that are available all through all these marketplaces, because

59:37.340 --> 59:44.300
competition and competition pushes those prices down, you have a walled garden, you got to pay

59:44.300 --> 59:48.620
whatever they're telling them to pay. Bobby's needling you in chat say you only play Minecraft

59:48.620 --> 59:53.980
anyway. That is true. And to be fair, you are absolutely correct. I am hyper focused on

59:53.980 --> 01:00:00.940
Minecraft. But I but that is to say, you know, in because I have a horrible habit of doing this,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:08.460
I still buy a lot of games, I just don't believe them. But I buy lots of games on PC. Yeah,

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:13.980
then I'll play eventually, you know, when I retire, I'll be dead before that happens. But

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:19.260
you know, like, it'll be just, you know, don't be there so that somebody can play them someday.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:24.060
Or I will just collect them like you would like, I don't know, bobbleheads or something.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.460
Shane and chat says, Remember when everyone was crapping on Nintendo for their service and price?

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:33.020
It honestly feels like the best value to me right now for the price the NSO plus expansion?

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.620
Yes, I do remember that because I was one of the people crapping on it. But I will say I thought

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:41.580
you'll notice two years later, I finally did sign up this week because I was like, you know what?

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:47.980
Yeah, they've added a lot to NSO. And you know, on N64 in advance, and even just you know, I was

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:52.220
like, Oh, I could get those Mario Kart tracks and stuff for free. You know what? Fuck it. I'm gonna

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.100
finally sign up for that. So it took me a little while to get there. But like, yeah, like, honestly,

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.700
and then the other thing I just want to say with PS VR two real quick is that you know, and I've

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.820
said this before, but I'll say it again. It's very sad that Sony is not learning this lesson because

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:10.620
I really feel like the PS VR two is destined for the similar fate. The PlayStation Vita,

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:17.100
the PlayStation TV, it's a terrific piece of hardware, horribly supported by Sony.

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:24.380
And I don't I don't understand why they need to like, honestly, like, I think the best course

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.900
of action for Sony and something like that. And it's like, I get it, you got to push those

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:32.780
graphics and everything. But you got to develop something like the meta quests, like, honestly,

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:40.060
because that is as much as I hate meta, like, that piece of hardware is like my kids play that

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:46.540
all the time, like all the time. And they love it's just so easy to use. And it's it's decent

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:52.780
enough to run games in, you know, pretty decent games. So all they need to do is just something

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:58.220
like that that's not attached to a $500 console. And I get it like, you know, it pushes the

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.540
graphics and stuff, but is it really worth it to like be that high end on that? Because like,

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.940
you're really narrowing the market. Like if you expand it, make it more broad, you can have that

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:12.380
thing take off like, you know, imagine Sony titles on like, you know, a quest type of product

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:17.180
where it's easy, you know, it's like a couple 100 bucks to get in and then you're playing the Sony

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:22.700
catalog stuff like that's what they need to do not wall it off with $1,000 worth of how well is

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:29.340
that going to work for for Apple with their thing like that's an amazing piece of hardware. But it's

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:34.620
just like no one's gonna buy it because it's so expensive. And that's the thing. It's we're

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.860
waiting for all these prices to come down. It's just, I don't know, I think they need to do

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.540
something that's its own thing. I want to get a couple other comments out here. And then I'll

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:47.340
move on to the next story for time. But crystal skies in our chat. Hello. Hello says they need

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:52.620
to make it backwards compatible, you know. And that was a problem is that they did make a

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:57.180
hardware design choice to it. They can't make it backwards compatible because the VR works in a

01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:02.540
completely different way. And that's why you're seeing things like no man's sky, Tetris effect

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:07.020
and things getting like re released for PS VR, too, because they really are new releases,

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:12.380
because they have to adapt to the new way that PlayStation VR to handles VR versus the first

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:17.820
that was a choice they made. And you know, I, I get why they did it, because that's where the

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:22.780
tech is going. And it does allow them, you know, probably a better VR experience at the end of the

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.420
day. But yeah, it does suck. Like it's just like that. And that's the way a lot of people see it

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.820
is that comment right there. So yes,

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.860
yeah, it's the problem is what it's always been is some of these consoles that they put out,

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:40.380
you know, and I'm considering this like a console almost for Sony is they don't have the must have

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:46.780
system seller game on it. I'm sorry, the horizon game. That wasn't it. Like that was just not

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:51.340
experience, though. I did get to mess around that it's Yeah, and Bobby and Chad says the tech and

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:56.940
PS VR two is pretty good. It really is. Like if they just would put the first party games behind

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.820
it to really sell it, like give it a half life Alex or something, you know,

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:06.380
like a God of War game, like where your cradles and you're throwing the axe and stuff like that,

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:11.980
like that could be really sweet. Give it a Spider Man game like is swinging around on a web and

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:18.220
stuff like that. It sounds motion see your I get it. I get it. But like, some people might like

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:25.580
that. Like you could do something like that. It would be really cool and just but it's unfortunately

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:29.660
it's gonna go the way like a lot of these Sony products do is where they just kind of forget

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:35.500
about it and it goes off and then we're like, you know, several summer game fests down the road and

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.500
we're like, Hey, where's all those PlayStation VR two titles and then the next thing you know,

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:45.260
oh, yeah, we stopped supporting it. What Vita you know, one more comment in chat here. Shane says

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:49.820
PS VR two already feels dead. They never talk about it. I don't even know about things coming

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:53.740
out for it because they don't talk about it. I can't follow every developer making games for it.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:05:01.180
So the games just go unnoticed since Sony ignores it. Ouch, but true. All right, let's move on. Our

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:06.140
next story is about kind of an update. Excuse me to something we talked about two weeks ago on the

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:12.700
show. And that is the fact that as we know, Charles Martinet will no longer be voicing Mario. There is

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:16.620
a new voice actor in Mario wonder they are still not saying who that is. I guess we just get to

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.540
find out when the credits roll in the game. What if it's the Final Fantasy 16 guy?

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:26.780
Oh, it's not it's not. And like I said, I, I understand why they kind of are keeping it under

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:33.020
wraps because that person is going to get bullied, unfortunately, and it sucks and they shouldn't I

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:39.020
want to make it very clear that type of behavior online is fucked up. But unfortunately, they don't

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:44.140
get but if they're not, they will you you hang out on Twitter, they're absolutely going to get

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:49.020
bullied because they're not Charles Martinet. They're gonna because the environment created on

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:54.860
Twitter by the person that runs Twitter only lends itself to hyper focusing that environment.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.300
They have to be on Twitter. I hopefully they're not just not making an account there that that

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:06.300
would be the smart move. Yes. I agree with that. I mean, more and more and more people even,

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:13.420
you know, verified people are leaving the platform anyway. So I, I don't know. Um,

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:21.900
I honestly think that there'll be those of us who are like, I'd say the true fan. But those who will

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:30.220
be like, welcome to the family. Yeah, you know, I am I would rather focus on, you know, I think that

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:34.860
if the people who are like welcoming speak louder than the people who are haters, and that's going

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.660
to make all the difference. That's a very good point is that, you know, we can, you know, send

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:44.860
some love to counteract all of that negativity that we know is coming. The part I want to say

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:48.540
with that, though, is that I don't think it's a good decision on Nintendo's part to make people

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:54.060
wait until the credits because that information will get leaked as soon as those press coffees

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:58.220
are out there coffees copies are out there, it doesn't matter what embargo you put on it,

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:03.740
that name will leak out. So Nintendo, my question to you is, do you want to control the narrative?

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:08.140
Or do you want Twitter to control the narrative? Because right now, out of Doug Bowser's mouth,

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:12.220
I'm hearing I want Twitter to control the narrative. I think that's a poor decision.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:19.420
So I do hope Nintendo will allow this new voice actor to be properly introduced before the game

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:25.260
comes out. But that's my thought. But anyway, a nice video that they did do was that they

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:30.780
actually did a video with Charles Martinet and Miyamoto. There wasn't really new information

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.620
in it. They were just kind of, you know, talking about Charles Martinet's new roles, the ambassador,

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.460
and you kind of got to hear it out of his mouth where Charles Martinet was like,

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:43.020
hey, I'm really happy to be doing this role. It's been an honor to be voicing Mario for years,

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.700
but I'm so excited to come to conventions and meet all of you. It was a very nice thing. It

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:51.500
was the kind of thing where I'm kind of surprised they didn't release that with the news two weeks

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:57.420
ago. But okay, it is what it is. And it's coming out now. Plus, I think I think it was very nice

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:04.060
of Charles Martinet to be a good sport. Because technically, he wasn't required to be but I get

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:09.740
that he wants to continue this good relationship with Nintendo. And he, you know, to be fair to

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:15.180
Nintendo, they were treating him better than unfortunately, a lot of voice actors get treated

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:19.500
in this industry. Like I was literally just looking at Jennifer Hale's Twitter the other day,

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.740
and she just casually said, Oh, yeah, I got replaced on this cartoon I was on because they

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:28.460
didn't want to pay union rates anymore. She's like, and that's, you know, that's how I found

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:32.620
out when the new season got announced with the with the new voice actors, you know, and so a lot

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:37.340
of voice actors are not treated very kindly in this industry. So I will give credit to Nintendo

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:43.100
that like they they made a decision. They're sticking to it. They're handling it with grace

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:49.580
best they can. So I will give them all of that. But like I said two weeks ago, if you really want

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.100
to show Charles Martinet how much you love him, pay him for a monograph when he comes to your

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.020
town. Pay him for an autograph and a selfie when it comes to your town. That is the best way to

01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:05.420
express your love. So there you go. Ah, yeah, thank you. Totally spies. Thank you, Rama.

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:11.660
Appreciate that. Anyway, let's move on. We have some more news. Dark Sakura.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:26.460
There we go. Now my unmute button is working. So I heard you. So this is a I mean, honestly,

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:33.260
I'm not surprised by it because it's Nintendo. But they have said that there are no plans

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:42.140
for any DLC for Tears of the Kingdom. I mean, they hardly had DLC for Breath of the Wild. So

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:47.980
I wasn't expecting anything. I always expect Nintendo to bring out, you know, if they're doing

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:54.860
a game. They're going to do a whole game. Breath of the Wild had DLC. Breath of the Wild had DLC.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.380
I said it had it barely had deals. Oh, you're right. Yeah, barely.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.260
I also just found a string piece of string cheese that's been on my desk since last night. Oops.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.540
Here's some deals right there. It's an unopened string cheese. But anyway, back to this.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:15.580
Basically, and this is the quote from Al Numa. There are no plans to release additional content

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:20.300
this time because I feel like I've done everything I can to create games in that world.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:26.300
In the first place, the reason why we chose this time as a sequel to the previous game is because

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:29.980
we thought there would be value experience and new kind of play in that place in Hyrule.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:36.540
Then, if such a reason is newly born, it may return to the same world again. This is translation

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:41.340
clearly. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play. So

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:47.180
I'd be happy if you could look forward to it. Translation is we don't want to provide you with

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.580
more items to build things out of because you've already made so many pornographic things already.

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:05.020
No, I just think that when Nintendo puts out a game, a first party game,

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:14.060
they tend to put out a fairly complete project that fulfills the goal they set out as far as

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:21.740
storytelling and experience. I don't know, I've never expected DLC with first party Nintendo

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:28.780
games. When the stuff came out for Breath of the Wild, I was pretty surprised, honestly.

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.700
It's not something like Splatoon that would be something that's a continuous, ongoing,

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:43.260
non-singular story. This is its own entity. Honestly,

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:49.660
I have no problem with this. Y'all ain't entitled to extra shit, y'all.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:55.500
I actually would love to see DLC on older games, like the original Zelda,

01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:00.700
let's give me a third and fourth quest, or new characters to play as.

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:04.380
You know the fan community is already taking care of that with the randomizers.

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:09.340
I get that. I get that. But it would still be cool. They do the save, save things,

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.420
which is fine. But it would be really cool to just, okay, let's do these things that we can

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:18.060
push. We couldn't have done on the Nintendo because we didn't have the memory space,

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.900
but now we can push it. DLC for Animal Crossing for GameCube.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:27.260
Super Mario 35 is what I'm hearing. That technically is the old game with the new

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:32.060
twist, right? Which I don't know why it was limited time. And you know there's rumors,

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:36.300
rumors that F F zero is going to get a 99 game.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:44.860
But I definitely agree with what Jamie said about like, Nintendo games are,

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.500
it's an accurate statement, Nintendo games are pretty fully featured. And we don't,

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:54.460
we think of Nintendo as a company that releases relatively bug free, like I shouldn't say 100%

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:59.340
bug free, relatively, yeah, relatively, compared to some of their peers. They do very good with

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:02.220
that and always doing like a fully featured type of product.

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.340
If something's going to have that Nintendo seal of approval on it, it's going to have earned it.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:13.100
But that that is true. And I would say it's also true that when they do decide to do DLC,

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:18.380
it's also a pretty rich and excited like, you know, like, you know, the Breath of the Wild.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:21.740
So I can see where maybe there's that disappointment of like, ah, Nintendo set the

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:26.540
bar so high with DLC, it's a bummer, they're not going to go through it with this. But it's not

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.220
like it's going to hurt the game in the long run, because the game itself is fully one of these

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:33.740
days, I'll get around to playing it is fully featured. And you know, you're not going to be

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:38.860
disappointed. And it's because they're working on a switch to anyway, like at this point, like,

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:44.060
you're not going to do it because the switch to would be out by the time this DLC would

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.540
hypothetical DLC would come out anyway. So they're just

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.580
releasing a Breath of the Wild.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.980
No, that's true. Well, Breath of the Wild ended up being a dual release. So yeah,

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:59.740
they could they could, you know, date, they may say that, yeah, we're not releasing DLC.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:07.980
There could be a special edition that comes out that has more content in it. That's technically

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:14.620
not DLC and technically is the best type of being right. 100 clip that we're going to be watching

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:19.260
this in six months when that's true. That is it. That's why there's no DLC.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.220
Hmm. Maybe.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:26.860
Maybe. All right. Well, since we brought up switch to why don't we go to our next big rumor?

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.020
Well, okay.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.220
Well, I'm sorry. Was there more?

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:35.900
Well, I know I had another another thought about it, too, is just that

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.940
Sorry, it's harder for me to see the avatar raising a hand than a real person. So

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.780
it's okay. It's just that I forgot what I was gonna say. So nevermind.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.320
Okay.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:50.240
I got totally distracted off of my thought.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:58.320
Okay. So there's rumors that last month during Gamescom that developers were shown a switch

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:06.640
to behind closed doors. Basically, allegedly, yes, your gamer had said that partners were shown tech

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:13.920
demos of how well the system is designed to run. And is there is one such demo was a souped up

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:24.480
version of Zelda Breath of the Wild. Ironic, ironic that they would be doing that. Lots of

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:31.600
rumors regarding specs and stuff that I've seen too. But I don't want to speculate in specs,

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.320
ray tracing and DLSS and all that stuff like that. We'll see what they come out with

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.720
when they announce it, which will happen eventually, after the holiday.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.480
Yeah, I mean, they're not gonna cannibalize holiday sales. No way I have anything about

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:51.520
this. No, it's not holiday for sure. I mean, it next year, maybe. Next holiday, possibly.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:16:01.120
But yeah, I mean, we'll see. We'll see. Dr. CSA, supposedly, it ran the UE five matrix demo. Well,

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.560
that the rumor, you know, I know, you don't want to get into specs. I understand why it's all

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.400
rumor anyway. But the rumors are saying it's PlayStation five level quality, but able to do

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.040
what the switch does, which would be pretty impressive, if true. That would be cool. Yeah,

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:21.280
I don't believe it. But that would be cool. Yeah, I take this as a very big grain of salt. I mean,

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.560
what I don't take with a grain of salt, a switch to is coming. Absolutely. The grain of salt part

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.920
is I think Nintendo is probably still trying to finalize those specs. And I think maybe I would

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:37.280
believe that they showed it to trusted partners at Gamescom to get feedback on some of that.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.040
What would it take? What what kind of power do you need to bring us this game on the console?

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.720
What do you need to do this sort of thing? I think the specs are still being negotiated. And they

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.840
might have shown the higher end of things. But I don't think that necessarily means it's the final

01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:00.800
product. So yeah, there's a lot a lot of that stuff still to be figured out. Okay, another

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.800
thing that kind of dates back to Gamescom a little bit, but this was this Pikmin Finder AR

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.560
game that came out. It's not Pikmin Bloom. And it's not Pokemon Go. But it's another Nintendo

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:18.000
and Niantic partnership. It's Pikmin Finder. It's an AR game that lets you scan the environment for

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.880
Pikmin and treasures. There's a little link, it's pikmin-finder.nintendo.net. And you go on it on

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.520
your mobile device, you do a little QR code. And that's that's how you get it all started.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.120
Essentially, honestly, I haven't really played around with this because it's just a way to just

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:39.760
scan the environment that they're trying to like scan people into like doing more 3D scans of

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:45.280
locations and stuff like that. No, but Niantic also already has a game like this called Peridot

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:51.680
that they put out. And I played Peridot for about a week. And because there's there's no game there.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.560
It's one of those things that's like, oh, that's interesting for about three days. And then you're

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:04.800
like, okay, I've seen it all done. And the the monetization in that game is horrific. Horrific.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.360
So I I'm, you know, you all know, I used to bang the drum on Niantic games here. I just want to

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:17.840
point out I'm uninstalling some of their games left and right. I my, my subscription in Ingress

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.720
lapsed yesterday. For those of you that didn't think I meant it when I said that a few weeks ago,

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:27.040
I no longer have a subscription Ingress core or whatever, whatever the the thing is, it's gone.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:35.840
So but I am for because I recognize that I like to gamify my fitness. I do still play Pokemon Go

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:42.640
and I play Pikmin Bloom. I haven't given any of those games a red cent since the incident

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.280
happened where I reported a cheater and nothing was done about it. And I'm over it. I'm not I'm

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:54.960
not supporting this system that is weekly and that does not have enforcement behind it. So anyway,

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.080
and as far as this demo goes, I mean, I'm sure it's cute, but it's probably cute for five minutes.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.960
And I've already seen that Niantic has been pushing this technology for quite some time now

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.760
between Peridot and some of these other things. It's time to show how you can actually make a fun

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:19.120
game out of it. Because Peridot isn't it. So show us. I'm going to just be very blunt. Show us the

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:26.480
fucking point. You know, like, like, I don't know, the not a Nintendo game, I would still love them

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.760
to see see something like elements member elements. That was a fun game from Konami.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.920
Like, they should do something like that. Like, that'd be cool. Maybe I guess that's

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.120
almost like Pikmin, you know, finding stuff hidden in your environment. But

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:47.120
yeah, I don't know. Niantic is kind of out of ideas, I guess they like the license and make

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:52.800
shells of like games. They have some gameplay to them. But you know, it's basically monetization

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:58.080
machines. I and I've said this before, and I'm going to be very careful not to repeat myself. But

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.800
the problem is, is that they are married to their mission statement more than they're married to

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:07.840
their player base. That's a problem. The reason why that's happening is because the individual

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:12.720
running the company is he is a smart guy. He's a brilliant mind. This is the guy behind Google

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.680
Maps. He's done a lot of very smart things. You know what he hasn't done run a game company.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:24.240
And that's the other problem. So what are you? Are you a game company? Or are you a get out and

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:30.960
explore the world company? Because it's starting to show that being both of those things is very,

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:37.520
very difficult. So get the help you need, or admit that you're not a game company because you're not

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:44.160
running it like one. Anyway, let's move on to our next story. Dark Sakura.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:52.480
So there's finally a specific home port of a game, but not quite how you think it's going to be.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:21:00.400
So Daytona USA two is finally coming home, but it's because it's built in to like a dragon guy

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:11.120
the man who erased his name. So I mean, the other game had some old Sega titles in it. So this one

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:19.920
is Daytona USA two, but it's going to be under the non-licensed name Sega Racing Classic two.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:28.480
And then also in the game is going to be Fighting Vipers two and some Master System ports of Flicky

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:36.720
and Galaxy Force. The game will be out on November 9th this year. But I mean,

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.560
I would just like them to go. I just want more Sega ages and bring something like that back out.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:51.120
Like legit, the Yakuza Sega arcade stuff is really cool. Like I would love like a Sega arcade that

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:55.680
has like all of what they've done throughout that series, like in one package. And I think

01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:03.440
they could sell that and it would work. Yeah. It's so weird that like a modern AAA game nowadays can

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:10.960
put, you know, older games that they publish into the game and not charge people extra for that

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:16.640
Nintendo. Sega does what Nintendo don't. Oh, come back. Yep.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:27.200
I love it. So, so I think the real question and I bet Bobby would want to know the answer

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.760
to this Dark Sakura. Could this with this getting the home port, everything is, is this how you

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:41.760
might play Yakuza? Um, did I ever say I wasn't gonna play it? Oh, okay. Just I mean, I have,

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:49.840
I have a I'm on a Mac. There's no way for me to play it. Oh, yeah. Because I, I feel like

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:54.240
like a dragon was I could be wrong was on state but it's cloud gaming is probably the way to do

01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:02.080
it. No, it came out after stadia shut down. And I mean, it might be on GeForce now. I mean,

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:10.720
I don't know. But um, I never said I was never gonna play it. It's Halo I won't play.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:20.640
To screw Halo. All right, uh, next story Loki. So apparently the announcement is that

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:28.880
Neetara is back and being up at being played by Megan Fox. So she's not only going to be doing

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.800
the voice for the character, but also doing the mocap for it as well, which is pretty cool.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:38.160
And you know, she of course, in the reveal trailer said, you know, she comes from this weird realm.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.800
She's the type of vampire creature. She's evil, but she's also good. She's trying to save her

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:49.200
people. I really like her. She's a vampire, which obviously resonates for whatever reason. Is it

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:56.240
because you're a vampire Megan Fox? Are you a vampire? She also said that I'm not really

01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:04.160
voicing it. She's kind of me. So that's kind of funny. Because she's a vampire. She is a vampire

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:12.640
confirmed Megan Fox vampire. Wow. Megan Fox is so goth you all she's so goth. No, I think it's

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.840
cool. It's whatever. I like to watch the trailer for we're actually playing it on b roll right

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.240
now. So yeah, I mean, no, I mean, I mean, but like, hear her voice. Yeah, no, I'm poking,

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.280
I'm poking fun at it. But like, I do think it's cool. Like it is a good job. Yeah. No,

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.760
and I like that, like, you know, Hollywood or like, you know, classic Hollywood or

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.000
ever want to call it is crossing over more and more into games like this. Because,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.600
you know, we all remember a day when games were like you, you wouldn't see trip. Well,

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.280
I don't know if Megan Fox is triple A, but she's probably at least a, you know, a list movie stars

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.400
participating in things like this. And now it's it's kind of a grand theft auto or something. Yeah,

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.600
it's very commonplace. So I think it's cool. Did you also see the what the other thing coming out

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:04.880
from Mortal Kombat one is the other skin for Johnny Cage. Oh, it's Van Damme. Yeah, yeah.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:12.160
Which is. And I think that is him doing the voicing, I think. Yeah. He was supposed to

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.440
originally have been the character that Johnny Cage became. Yeah. How full circle is that?

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.920
I completely forgot that Jean-Claude Van Damme was doing that. That's awesome.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.480
Yeah. Yeah, that's really cool. There's there's honestly

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.800
some pretty good talent involved in that game. Yeah, we finally got our street fighter cross

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.600
Mortal Kombat now. This is not how we thought. But you know how fun. Oh, that means somebody

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:44.240
could do that in Mugen. They could take guile versus Johnny Cage, both Jean-Claude Van Damme

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.400
and we could finally see that back. You know, that's coming. Let's see a lot of comments and

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.520
chat lighting up about this crystal skies and chat says, I mean, JK Simmons and Jason Isaacs

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.120
in Baldur's Gate 3 is amazing. Yes. Keep in mind. JK Simmons in anything is awesome.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:05.840
Jason Isaacs was also in Midnight Sons, Marvel's Midnight Sons as Mafisto and he was perfect.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.280
Also something to keep in mind with the strike going on right now, video games are something

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.920
that they that celebrities can work with. The screen actors can work, at least for now. Yes,

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.480
I've heard about the whole voting in advance of, you know, to authorize a strike. I'm well aware

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.480
of that situation, but we haven't heard of a strike being authorized on the games industry

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.760
yet. So for now, you know, screen actors still work there. I wonder if we're not going to see

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.800
more of these types of collaborations, you know, in a year, a year and a half's time because

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.520
it allows some of the actors to work. Could be very interesting. See what that happens.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.440
Also, Questbuster in chat warns, in addition to the Mortal Kombat 1 story,

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.840
the full story was already leaked and exists in clips out there. So watch out.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.480
Yeah, well, that that game is also out this coming week, I think very soon. Yeah,

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.000
if you have the collector's editions on the 15th, otherwise you gotta wait until

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.920
next Tuesday. It's still not very long. It's, uh, they're very good at announcing those games

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:10.000
and then they're coming out like three months later. So yeah. All right. Well, let's talk about

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.320
a game that's gonna, that did not get a similar announcement pattern because we don't know when

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:20.640
this game is ever going to come out. Uh, but it is Elder Scrolls 6 and the news about exclusiveness

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:29.280
is back in the news. Um, because it has to do with, um, uh, I think this is evidence that went

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.840
in with Microsoft's battle with the FTC. There was some vagueness about if this game would be

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.520
Xbox only because of course they don't want the courts to think, you know, there's going to be

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:47.840
antitrust problems or whatever. So they say, um, with Elder Scrolls 6, it's so far out. It's hard

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.120
to understand what the platforms will even be. We're talking about a game that's five plus years

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.320
away. Remember that? Well, in an interview with Bloomberg this week, Phil Spencer was asked to

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.760
get about Elder Scrolls 6 saying, we looked at it on a case by case basis with the games we build.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.400
We want to make sure our games are available in so many different places on our Xbox consoles,

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.520
on PC, also via cloud. These games can come to almost any web enabled device.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.760
We're looking at millions and millions of players who will have access to star field and other Xbox

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.640
game studios games. It's really about giving players choice around how they want to play

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:30.560
and build their library games. I mean, like, look, he answered it in that quote right there.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.640
And this is the thing I understand this doesn't generate clicks for your website and all that

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.960
stuff, but really look at what he's saying. And he can't, he can't say it so explicitly because

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:45.680
there are still court things going on with Microsoft. Granted, Microsoft says Microsoft

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.480
Bethesda was settled a long time ago, but they're still trying to project this image of, oh yeah,

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:54.560
we were going to put our games everywhere. Activision, Blizzard come be a part of that.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.920
Yeah. You know, they want to project that image to all these regulatory bodies around the world.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.040
So he can't be explicit yet. If you read between the lines in that comment, he literally says

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:11.040
between Xbox on the way between Xbox cloud, Xbox system and PC, we're going to get this

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.800
game everywhere. We don't need PlayStation five. That's right. He's saying without saying.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.400
Yeah. And, and nor should the FTC be like suggesting that they need to put that game

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:28.480
on a PlayStation console because like, I'm sorry, Sony, they're not publishing Spiderman on Xbox.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.720
Like why, why the double standards here? Like, I don't even understand why they would push that.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:38.240
And I'm sure that somebody in the FTP or FTC is just not clear enough to realize that like

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:43.120
a Bethesda game is not an Activision game. And it's completely two different scenarios here, but

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:49.680
yeah, it's, it's even, it's a stupid thing to even inquire about. Like, I don't understand.

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:58.880
So elder scrolls six is exclusive to Microsoft. I guarantee it. That's like, I don't know why

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:05.040
we're continuing to debate this. It's it's look at what they're saying. It's going to be exclusive

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.240
a hundred percent, especially the way he compares it to starfield. Hello. Starfield just went

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:16.320
through this exact same, uh, speculation and questions and talk arounds and all this stuff.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:21.840
And what happened? It's exclusive elder scroll six will be. And, and, and that's okay.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:26.560
Microsoft is buying these big companies so they can have exclusives to take on

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:32.400
Sony's what Sony's got and refuses to put out on all of their devices. That's another

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:37.360
interesting thing. Well, nevermind. We'll, we'll go to that another day. All right. Moving on.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:44.080
Let's, let's, let's go back to a, a more classic time in this next segment as we usually do.

01:30:44.080 --> 01:31:00.400
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:06.560
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. All right. But

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:13.040
dark soccer, you have a classic non game tonight, if I remember right. So what did you pick for us

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:21.200
tonight? I picked connect for another game that has made enemies of entire families.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:29.760
So, um, it has gone by other names, uh, not just connect for, with the number four or spelled out

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:37.680
four, but four up plot for fine for captain's mistress four in a row, drop four and gravitrix

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:41.040
in the Soviet union. I'm only going to call it captain's mistress from now on.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.440
I'm kind of down for that. Um, but at any rate, um, you have two colors and your goal is to make

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:58.960
four in a row, either, um, uh, you know, uh, right up, uh, vertically horizontal or diagonally. Um,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:09.520
and, uh, basically it's already what's referred to as a solved game, meaning that it's one that

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:19.360
you can predict as long as people play perfectly. Um, now, um, the, uh, the thing about this one

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:27.280
is that the official connect for trademark came out in February, 1974 by Milton Bradley. But

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:34.080
the theories behind the game have already existed well before that. So I don't know if anyone

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:39.840
remembers the pretty sneaky CIS commercial, cause they redid that commercial a couple of times in

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:45.760
the history of that game. Um, but as it said in that commercial connect four of your checkers

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:50.240
in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same, but look out, your opponent can sneak up

01:32:50.240 --> 01:33:01.280
on you and win the game. Um, so it actually has a lot more to go with a little bit of a mathematical,

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:10.800
uh, uh, theory behind it. Um, it's what's referred to also as a zero-sum game.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:21.440
Yeah, that, that's, that's the commercial. Um, meaning that, um, there are two sides,

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:29.040
but one is strictly advantaged and one is strictly disadvantaged. So, um, but the first time the game

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:36.960
was ever solved, like completely was, uh, by James Dow Allen on October 1st, 1988,

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:46.000
and then independently by Victor Alice on October 16th, 1988. And it basically was by developing

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:54.560
strategy to mathematically figure out where the, uh, the items should fall to get a perfect,

01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:04.880
a perfect game. Um, and, uh, they actually, they've even, um, had AI applied to it to figure

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:13.520
out all the various, uh, different formulas that could be used to decide optimal gameplay. Um, but

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.120
the biggest thing with the connect four is that honestly, the first one who does it first

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:23.600
is the winner, you know, who makes, who makes it, uh, we used to play like, um,

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:28.240
not the first person to get the four, but how many could you get out of the board,

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:32.240
you know? So it was, it was pretty, pretty interesting.

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.760
Oh, like how many four connections could you get once all the pieces were played?

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.040
Exactly.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.120
Oh, that's an interesting little house rule. I like that.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:45.520
Yeah. So, um, there are other variations of the game that have different board sizes and

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:53.040
game pieces and rules and stuff like that. Um, the variations, um, are really good for,

01:34:53.040 --> 01:35:00.880
you know, again, folks who use, you know, AI for, uh, for, uh, projections and, um, game theorists.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:09.280
So the most common board is, uh, seven columns by six rows. Variations can be five by four,

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:15.360
six by five, eight by seven, nine by seven, 10 by seven, eight by eight and infinite connect four,

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.400
and then cylinder infinite connect four, which I haven't seen either of those.

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:30.160
Um, so basically though, you're pretty much going, you know, just, just drop it in,

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:36.960
see what happens. So, um, there are other, uh, variations, like I was saying, pop out,

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:43.120
darts traditionally the same way, but, um, you, you know, you alternate your pieces,

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.240
everyone takes their turn, but during each term, a player can either add another disc from the top,

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:55.600
or if one has any discs of their own color on the bottom row, they can pop out that disc instead.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:00.960
And so it drops down everything from above it, you know, kind of like clearing out a Tetris line.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:09.920
Um, they also pop 10, which, um, you set up your discs into the slot filling up from only

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:16.160
the bottom row and then moving on until the next row is filled. So you're, you're doing your four

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:24.880
like that. There's also five in a row, of course, played on a six by nine grid. Um, power up, which

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:32.320
is, um, like they have like a power checkers piece, um, where you can choose to play it once

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:37.440
per game. And it has an anvil icon. If you play like one with an anvil icon, you have to pop out

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:43.200
all the pieces below it. Um, you know, just different, different variations like that.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:49.760
So as far as, um, other versions of the game, there's a giant connect four, and we actually

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:59.680
see someone who has constructed one. Um, there, yeah, this is the largest version. Um, it has made

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:06.000
from weather resistant wood and measures 120 centimeters in both width and height. Um, it was

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.880
released for the Microvision video game console in 1997, uh, developed by Robert Hofburg. And it was

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:20.720
also released on the TI 99 for computer. I have played that one. Um, in 1979, of course I, I was

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:27.680
a little bit older when I played it. Um, it also, I mean, one of the fun things about it is that

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.640
you can just play a very quick game. There's travel versions of it. There's also another

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:40.880
one they made in 2007 called connect for stackers, which instead of the grid, um, you have a board

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:48.160
that you're placing your discs on. Um, there's also a physical game called connect four by four,

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:55.040
where it has two layer vertical grid with colored discs for four players plus blocking discs.

01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:02.080
Um, in 2013, Baytech games released, uh, a connect for ticket redemption, arcade game

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.840
under license by Hasbro, uh, 2015 winning moves published connect for twist and turn

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.800
where you have a game tower instead of a grid. And it has five rings that twist independently.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:21.040
Sounds complicated. And then Baytech games in 2018 released a connect for arcade game called

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.080
connect for hoops where you throw basketballs and then they show up as checkers on the screen.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:34.240
Um, so moving, uh, a little bit, a little bit past that, um, oh, actually I take that back.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.800
Um, there was connect for shots released by Hasbro in 2018, where you have to bounce the

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:47.280
colored balls onto a grid until you achieve four in a row. So to go into some pop culture stuff,

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:54.000
um, uh, Stuart Mcconey, while working with NME, uh, started a rumor that connect for was invented

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:03.120
by David Bowie. Nope. On, uh, the hubs show Friday game night, there is a game, uh, called connect

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:09.120
for basketball. So you use basketballs to play Nintendo did a version of this called four in a

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:16.000
row, um, for their tabletop games compilation and clubhouse games, 51 worldwide classics for the

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:24.560
switch. And then a game, uh, a way out, uh, you can play connect for as a mini game. And there you go.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:32.480
All right. Your classic non-video game of the month connect for great choice. Um,

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:38.400
have you ever played? Oh, what's that? I was just going to say, can you guess anything that's next?

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.720
Do you want to hazard a guess? I mean, I think I've shown you the list, but no, I don't think

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:52.080
I've seen the list. So you have not know. So, um, yeah. Whatever could be happening, whatever could

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:57.760
it be? We'll find out. We'll find out soon. Um, a couple of things, Jamie, I lost your avatar.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:00.960
I don't know if it's because I was running B roll or something, but I'm getting the squares

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.440
on discord. I don't know what's going on. Sorry. Um, and, uh, what was the other thing I was going

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:10.640
to say? Oh, have you, the last time I played connect for was actually, have you ever played

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:16.320
the one they have at the bolt, which for those not, yeah. Yeah. For those not from this town is

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:22.560
kind of the local, uh, uh, daddy bar, I guess, but it's pretty welcoming to all walks of life.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:29.120
Um, but it's, uh, they gotta, they have one of those giant connect fours. So, um, it always that

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:33.360
and the Jenga always makes a big thud when the game's over. Cause they have one of those life

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.640
sized Jenga's out there too. And, uh, they're always making gigantic noise when they fall apart.

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:46.480
So yeah. Hmm. All right. I do not know what's going on with this thing. Cause I have it set to

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:54.400
not put the stupid little camo thing on my window and it still does it. Um, during that segment,

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.800
somebody in chat reminded me of a big headline that we didn't have on our list tonight. So I

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.480
hope you won't mind me adding something here on the fly, but I think this is worth bringing up.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:09.120
And that is, uh, the announcement that read pop and the ESA have broken up. Uh, they will not be,

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:13.840
yeah. Read pop and the ESA have broken up. They will not be working on E3 next year.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.840
And, uh, it has already been announced. The ESA has informed the LA convention center

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:25.520
that there will not be an in-person show in 2024. That is because if you listen to what I said

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:32.560
earlier this year, there will never be another E3. Uh, look, we talked a lot about this,

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.560
but, um, E3 is, is long since dead and gone, but I am, I am actually legitimately surprised by this

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:44.560
news because I thought for sure this was just, Oh, read pops just going to produce E3 as a fan

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:50.000
convention like packs or have E3 at packs. But even that has apparently fallen apart

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:57.040
for whatever reason. I wonder if the ESA is really hard-headed and that they really think

01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:06.400
they're going to get a show at the LA convention center again. Um, I am left to not be sure what

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.200
else could be the possibility. Uh, the ESA has said in a statement, we appreciate read pops

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.760
partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.720
together through their various events. While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.120
Let's let the crickets chirp for that one. We are continuing to explore how we can evolve it

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:32.160
to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event from format

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:39.360
to location. We're good at getting into physical magazine publication. That's a winning strategy

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.720
from format to location. So E3 is going to be moving from the LA convention center to

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:49.840
the banquet room at Applebee's. Um, we are committed to our role as a, uh,

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:55.120
kind of vendor, Kevin, or for the industry convener airport Hilton, and, uh, look forward

01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:05.040
to sharing news about E3 in the coming months. Hmm. Very interesting. Um, I was just curious

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.120
about something when bringing this whole thing up. So let me actually, I just wanted to check out,

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:15.120
uh, yeah, I'm doing this live. I have no idea what to expect here. Um, so I'm actually looking

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:21.280
at the ESAs website right now, because I'm just kind of curious, like, what are some things that

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:29.120
the ESA has done for the industry? Okay, here we go in the news back on August 23rd, essential facts,

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:34.960
key findings. Okay. So they did a study, I guess that's something neat. And then we go back over

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:40.480
a month before that for their last big headline, July 20th gaming for everyone creating an

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.720
inclusive environment for a global player community. Well, yes, I agree with that games

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:50.720
are for everyone, but how did the ESA do that? Let's see. They gathered with experts, innovators

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:56.160
and change makers in New York's games for change festival. So the ESA didn't put it on. They went

01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:03.680
somewhere else. They showed up. Showing up is really like the most important step, right?

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:12.160
The ESA is dead. They just don't know it yet. Don't tell them. All right, moving on. Let's

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.160
talk about some other news, uh, that happened this week rapidly in our industry with rapid fire news.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.880
We'll, we'll give you some more headlines faster than the ESA will. Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:30.880
Yes. So I am very excited about this. Uh, it is another thing that you can get to build a console.

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:37.520
So this is not necessarily coming from Lego this time, but it's mega blocks or I think it,

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.560
I don't know if it's mega blocks or mega constructs because they used to have the

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.680
constructs license as well, but mega block, I guess maybe they went back to that. Um,

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:55.440
they have a three to four or three fourth scale replica of the Xbox 360 and it is $150. It's 1400

01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:03.920
pieces and it includes the Xbox 360 console, the controller and a replica of halo three,

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.640
the case and everything. Um, the thing that bothers me the most about this is the internals.

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.320
They do show that there's like actual, um, circuit boards and stuff on the inside and it does not

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:23.360
look like an Xbox 360. I have taken part so many of those. It's just, they kind of close ish.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.440
It's, it's, you know, it's, it's, you tried it too. You tried, like they, they, they put

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.760
some things in there and they're like, yeah, I think it's like a Borgos or like, you know,

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:41.920
heatsink goes here. Some, some resistors go here close enough. Um, but I mean, it still looks cool.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:46.000
Um, I don't know what everyone hates on mega blocks. I mean, they've got some pretty good

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.680
Pokemon, um, builds. I've done their like giant Pikachu thing that they did and that was pretty

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:59.440
sweet. Um, but yeah, it'll be out in October on the eighth and they had pre-orders for it.

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:06.080
It's exclusively at target and it's sold out already, but I'm in target all the time. So I

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.960
will just have to keep an eye out. Also, I have no room for this whatsoever, but.

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.280
We can just add that to the queue of unbuilt crap in our house.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:22.640
Um, what is not included though with it is the ginormous immense brick of a power supply

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.480
that is not included with the kit. And fortunately that would have bumped up the

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.840
purchase price of $250 and they just weren't willing to do that.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.480
Or a red filter. So you can create your red ring of death.

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:39.440
I do. Oh yes, that too. Um, yeah, it does light up. Um, I do like how the box though is the same

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.960
box as the Xbox three 60, which is pretty, pretty cool. So I do like that about it. Um,

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.960
is the original model or one of the slims is the original model, the original model.

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:54.080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I'm, I'm pretty, you know, I did check it out. Um,

01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:00.720
I don't, yeah, I it's a little pricey, but you know, it's, it's not too bad for 1400 pieces.

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:09.120
All right. What else? And then, uh, we've got more stuff coming to Nintendo switch online.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.360
So this week we got a few, um, Game Boy, Nintendo, and super Nintendo games. Um,

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:23.520
starting with a quest for Camelot for the super Nintendo, uh, we have, uh, Kirby star stacker

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:33.600
and on the, um, for the NES and then also, uh, downtown and Nakatsu March super awesome

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:40.080
field day and joy mech fight. It's a CUNYO game. Yep. It is a CUNYO game.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:46.720
And those are as well for the, uh, Nintendo or yeah, for the NES.

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:57.360
All right. Uh, what do you have? So I have, um, for fans of cold to the lamb, like myself,

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:05.840
uh, there is our custom controllers released that are available now, um, through a, uh,

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:13.840
a website, uh, for captain Alex CPT and Alex all inward, who's selling, uh, dual sense Xbox

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:20.240
controllers, joy con and pro controllers. And if you get one, you will also get like with,

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:27.440
with the special package, it's like 165 bucks for one. Um, but you can get a licensed custom

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.640
controller, premium packaging, a two inch hard enamel spinner pin that I kind of just

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:40.480
want the pin and a stainless steel authenticity card that is signed by captain Alex. And you can

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:46.320
just go to captain Alex.com to see what they are. I just want the pin. That's all.

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:52.960
All right. Well, uh, you heard about it in the intro and this is just so silly. We have to talk

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.840
about it, but you know what? Uh, who, who doesn't love video games more than cup noodle and, uh,

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.840
all of their various collaborations they do. I love all their collaborations. They can,

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:09.200
there's no collaboration that has been amazing. Well, they know that gamers apparently love cup

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:12.240
noodle, by the way, we are not being paid for this product placement. And I feel like we ought

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:17.760
to be, but it was reported on CNN. It's in the news. We should bring it up. The gaming cup noodle

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.320
is coming out in Japan. So it's not coming out here. Uh, but, uh, maybe Akuma JP is still out

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.760
there. It can get us some, uh, it is coming out on September 18th in Japan gaming cup noodle.

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:33.200
This is. It's also a rainbow colored package that looks really cute. I got to say it's why,

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:40.480
what makes it gaming cup noodle it's caffeinated, caffeinated ramen, but it's going to be available

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:46.880
in garlic, garlic, and black pepper yakisoba varieties, which both sound pretty good. Honestly,

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:53.200
uh, both versions are soup free. So, um, you don't have to worry about the soup spilling out and

01:49:53.200 --> 01:50:02.080
over. I was, I was worried that there'd be soup in my soup. That's right. So, um, it's, you know,

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:08.560
again, obviously when this showed up in fall of SC 15, it was a huge hilarity.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:11.920
They're just like, okay, let's, let's just take, we're going to take the soup.

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:14.320
Let's remove the soup, put caffeine in there instead.

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:19.360
Now it's gamers soup, but it's not soup. It doesn't make any sense,

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.320
but I love it because it's totally cup. It makes any sense. It's the most random

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:30.160
fucking thing in the world that I'm here for it. So, all right, let's check. This is the

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:40.560
type of leadership that we need for the ESA cup noodle needs to run the E3 show. It would be

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.040
insane. Like I would just love it. We are at the point where cup noodle is a better run company

01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:52.800
than the ESA. Yes. A hundred percent co-signed. Oh my God. All right. Uh, let's travel around

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:57.040
the world and check out some release dates and some things you can pick up with your, uh, cup

01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:03.200
noodle, uh, gamer variety. Let's start in the U S uh, Loki. Uh, lots of stuff. We're in fourth,

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.080
we're not really in fourth quarter yet, but maybe it's basically fourth quarter at this point.

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:15.360
Uh, so we have Axiom Verge two on the Xbox one rain, uh, rain world on PlayStation five,

Awesome game. If you haven't played on PC yet, uh, highly recommend you pick it up on consoles.

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:18.640
Uh, um, maniac mechanics on Nintendo switch, Naraka blade point on PlayStation five. Uh,

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:26.320

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:06.720

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:36.080
Uh, I know we joke about a lot of collector edition stuff coming out of Japan, but the,

um, yeah, it looks like it comes with like, uh, uh, fake CD kind of thing. Uh, also just

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:48.480

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:46.640
the listener round table. I don't know if we have emails tonight. I forgot to look, find out. Nope.

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:50.880
All right. But maybe we'll get a call or two and, uh, some questions from chat as well. And

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:56.080
just a little bit, we still have some stories starting with Loki. Yep. So we talked a little

01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:01.680
bit about this, I think a few weeks ago about X-Box new reporting system that they're going to

01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:07.840
have. Uh, now they have actually launched it. Um, initially in the U S UK, Canada, Ireland,

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:14.480
Australia, and New Zealand, it's going to be for reporting abusive voice chats and it allows you to

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.160
the system is going to capture 60 second clips and save it to your console. And you have 24

01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:26.160
hours to complete your report. And then you can send off the offending clips to Microsoft's and

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.360
ban somebody, or at least give them seven warnings. I think they had originally,

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.080
seven strike plan. Yeah. That's some game of baseball there. Um, our feature is designed

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.760
so that only, only you, the player can initiate the capture of the last 60 seconds of gameplay.

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:50.720
Activity occurred for the content moderation purposes that says it works. Um, let's see,

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:55.520
they will not appear in your recent captures and the clips cannot be downloaded and modified

01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:06.160
or shared. Um, okay, cool. I mean, well, I mean, if it's abusive content, then you shouldn't share

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:11.760
it. Right. Right. I would assume, you know, um, so I guess you got to really be on the ball though,

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.960
if it's, you know, only 60 seconds previously. So it makes, it doesn't make sense.

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.120
I do feel like there's been a lot more companies that have been taking this sort of abuse that

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.960
happens on platforms a little more seriously. Like I've been seeing just, you know, cause I've

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:30.160
been playing a little more Overwatch lately and I, uh, have seen people that are using the reporting

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.720
features in there and you actually get the actual reports that say something happened, which is nice.

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.800
I wish other games I've played in the past would do something like that. Um, that, that let them

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:43.360
know that their reports didn't go to waste. So, um, it's just interesting to see, you know,

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:47.360
especially considering, you know, that, that example is jumping out at me and I'm thinking

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:51.200
about who Microsoft is trying to buy right now, that they are trying to clean up, you know,

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:58.480
a lot of the stuff shenanigans that happen on Xbox live. So yeah. Um, let's just, let's just

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:03.920
hope it leads to cleaning up some of these things that we assume to be true about Xbox live, uh,

01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:10.400
and a place where everyone feels welcome, which is very important. So, uh, dark soccer.

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:18.480
Um, for the game sea of stars, their developer sabotage is working on some DLC.

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:26.000
So of course this is a retro RPG. It's a pretty well liked from what I understand. Um,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:34.880
but on Canada radio, their CEO theory Bollinger, I guess, uh, was, uh, basically, uh, saying that

01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:39.760
there's going to be some, some new stuff. And there was also a blog post at the time that said

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:46.080
a fully fledged site adventure DLC would be called throws of the watchmaker and would expand even

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:53.120
more on the world of sea of stars. And there you go. I definitely like that's one of those games

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.080
that just came out in this last week where it's like, Oh my God, I got to get around to that too.

01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:01.200
Yeah. I've heard a lot of good things about it. Just, you know, the, that it really feels like

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:05.840
some type of spiritual successor to chrono trigger. Um, and I don't know why there's

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.880
this rumor out there that I hate chrono trigger. I don't, um, I I'm very excited to check out this

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.840
game and, and, uh, uh, check it out. It looks really cool. I've, I've saw a little bit of

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:21.680
streaming of it, but not at times. I didn't want to spoil it for myself. So. All right.

01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:30.320
Loki. Uh, yes. So that wonderful game stray about the cat wandering through a cyberpunk

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:37.520
dystopia is, um, apparently going to be getting a movie, an animated movie. Um,

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:44.720
and they said, you know, it's, um, they called the game the greatest hope punk movie that's

01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:50.320
ever been made. Um, I'm excited about it. I'm gonna think of you a good property to make an

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:57.120
animated movie for. So we'll see what ends up happening with that when it's coming. Um,

01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:08.400
neat. Yeah. Um, I, uh, obviously we are seeing a lot of games get adapted into movies and TV

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:13.760
and all that sort. So I can't say it's too surprising, but it's kind of cool. Cause that's

02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:19.120
stray. I don't want to say it came out of nowhere, but like, I, you know, they announced it and

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:23.280
everybody was like, Ooh, the cat game. And everybody then kind of like jumped on board

02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:28.640
with it. And it did, it did very well as a result. So, um, because it delivered on being the cat

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:33.040
game. Uh, and I think people really had fun with it. So it's kind of, and I didn't realize that,

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:38.880
uh, Anna Purna is actually, they have an animation studio and a Purna animation that they made a

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:45.520
Nomura or Nimona on Netflix. So they've already done an animated movie. So now they get to use

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:51.200
their own property for that. Yeah. Uh, Tiger con chat says the title might cause confusion

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:56.720
because there was a movie called strays, a dog movie that's rated R and we get movies that come

02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.800
out with the same title. Sometimes like, you know, after a few years go by and I don't think this is

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.640
something that's going to be coming out this year. It's going to be a few years off. Put the cute cat

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:14.480
on the poster or the, the little, um, box art. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and crystal skies points out,

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:22.000
they finished Nimona. Uh, they didn't fully make it. Oh, got it. Okay. Okay. All right. Um,

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:28.160
I think we got one more here and, uh, this is a little bit surprising. Uh, this kind of came out

02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.320
of nowhere, but I'm, I'm having a flappy bird kind of moment hearing about this and it's not exactly,

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:39.920
but yeah. Okay. Well, let's talk about it. So it is the viral game only up, which you may have seen

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:44.240
played on Twitch. Cause a lot of people have been playing it on Twitch. Uh, it's no longer available

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.080
on steam. It was delisted from steam. Uh, this game has had a lot of interesting chat around it

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:55.520
because there's been talk about infringing assets. Cause somebody there's that the fact that the game

02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:01.200
promoted NFTs, which we all know of pretty much flopped in the industry at this point, uh, gamers

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.400
won on that one. We pushed back against that boy. Oh boy. I think finally enough companies heard us

02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:11.600
that NFTs, you don't hear anybody talking about it in games anymore. Well, except in like very

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:17.280
obscure places where they belong. Um, but now the creator of the game says they need to put the

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.800
game behind them due to stress. What I need now is peace of mind and healing says the developer

02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:29.920
S C K R games. There was an update on the steam page, uh, about the decision saying I'm a solo

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.960
developer and this game is my first experience in game dev, a game I did for creativity to test

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:39.680
myself and where I made a lot of mistakes. The game has kept me under a lot of stress all these

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:44.160
months. Now I want to put the game behind me and yes, the game won't be available in the steam

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:49.520
store soon. That's what I decided myself. And sure enough, it is no longer available.

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:57.200
Don't make an NFT game. Well, I don't necessarily think the NFT part was that big. It was,

02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:59.840
they weren't like, it wasn't, that wasn't front and center. I want to say like,

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:04.720
it's not in the game. I want to say maybe the developer at one point like talked about it

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:08.400
possibly. Like it's one of those things that I think the headline got bigger than it actually

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:14.000
was like weren't in the game. Yeah. I don't know if it was a lot of the infringing assets.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.960
I know that was some contention before legit. Yeah. Because yeah, I'm wondering if it's more

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:28.480
of like legal, um, you know, pressure, you know, to like, okay, let's put this, let's, let's,

02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:33.040
let's take this away. So no one else can find more assets or infringe type of thing because

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:38.240
I'm just a solo dev. And if I get sued, I'm gonna be in trouble. Cause I don't have a lot

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:43.920
of money. Uh, so Bobby points out that there was NFT iconography in the game. So maybe there were,

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:50.800
the dev was probably a fan of this and, uh, probably inserted some of that into the game,

02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:59.360
but did the game itself use NFTs? It does not appear so. So, um, but all that aside,

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.720
it was very popular on Twitch and it's not often you hear about popular games where the developer

02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:09.760
just says, I'm out and just up and leaves. And that's, that's kind of why I pulled in the

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:13.520
reference to flappy bird, which I know is a bit of a different circumstance, but that's another

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.480
one where I think right at the height of that game's fame, the guy said, I, I don't want to

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:27.120
do this anymore. Bye. And that was, that was it. And by golly, he stuck to his word. Right. So I,

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:32.640
it's interesting to see this happen. Um, that's, you know, basically leaving that money on the

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:37.360
table, but at the same time, I get it. It's a lot of stress when you're this one person,

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:42.640
your game is under a microscope and people are talking about NFT references or, you know,

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:46.240
the, the status of where certain assets came from and so forth.

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:50.400
Or just updating your game. Like you just don't want to do it anymore. Like I don't want to

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:56.160
support this game anymore. So like, I can't sit here and say, I blame him, but it's like,

02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:59.440
you know, you got to put your mental health above everything else, period. I'm always going to

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:06.000
support that, but it is just still so you don't often see people walk away from this level of a

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.360
game with the exposure that it had for that. And that's just kind of what makes this like

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:17.440
surprising. But I, I don't wish the developer any ill will for sure. I hope he finds the piece he's

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:23.200
looking for, um, with this decision. Cause that is, that is a lot of money to leave behind. Um,

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:31.120
so good luck to him. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's go to our round table where we will solicit any

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:36.320
other questions y'all might have for us in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.440
against which TV vog network. Um, you could also, if you want to head on over to our discord,

02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:45.520
you can hop in the green room and we'll take some calls. Um, I believe dark Sakura already

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:50.080
mentioned we have no emails tonight, but if you'd like to send us an email for a future week,

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:56.720
participate at orange laundry.com is a great place to do it. Um, I will admit I did not check

02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:01.440
our Twitter this week to see if we got anything, but I will take a look at that real quick,

02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:08.000
just because I've been on that website less and less, but, um, I will still take a look.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.200
I see dark soccer's plug for the show. Oh, I guess I could, I did tag OLR in this,

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:18.480
but since it's somewhat related, um, uh, talking a little bit about star field real quick.

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:22.560
One of the things I did like in star field was that they have some really cute little Easter

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:28.160
eggs and some of the art it's very tangential to, um, fall out. And some of the interesting

02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:32.800
things you see there, but like I was rating a random moon base and I saw this poster

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.880
rely on each other and it looked like all the people holding hands, like, you know,

02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:41.280
at the end of up, um, spoiler alert, that's big vibes. I got, I also, this was my favorite,

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:47.440
a vending machine that says we are so sorry for any inconvenience. We are currently out of ice,

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:52.080
but the gag is it's so old the, and it's abandoned on the moon. It's been iced over,

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:57.440
but I just, I don't know. I, I love those cute little like Easter eggs that are in the

02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:00.480
environment. Dark soccer. I feel like this is something you can appreciate too. When you used

02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:05.120
to do things like the mass effecting blog where, you know, you would go around and find all these

02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:09.920
things in the environment, like store names on the Citadel and things like that. Yeah. Yeah.

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:14.400
This one's intimate lingerie. Like that stuff like that is really funny to me.

02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:17.040
I have a last minute story. If you'd want to. Oh, sure. Let's do it.

02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:26.960
So this comes from, um, a, I don't know. It's, I guess it's from a website, the boy from Mexico.

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:33.360
It's this guy, uh, talking Edward Dennis, uh, who's talking about his book, but in the, about

02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:40.800
this Edward Dennis guy, it says artist, author, animator, game designer. And one of the blurbs

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:49.040
in here says, um, uh, in addition to this, Edward is working with paramount pictures on a video

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:56.800
adaptation of their twin peaks property. Now, obviously not a video adaptation. I think the

02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:04.720
referencing video game is just mistyped in here, but could there be a twin peaks game coming

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:11.840
from paramount? Could that have just been placeholder text or something? I don't know.

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:18.160
I'm a little, this, this is a reach to me. Um, I mean, I would love to see some type of official

02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:23.600
twin peaks game. Here's the thing. I don't see it as something David Lynch would get into.

02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:29.600
That's, that's where my, that's the real block from my mind. Like, I, I don't want to,

02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:34.320
you know, just because this is just a random thing, I'm a person I've never heard of. I don't

02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:38.880
want to necessarily dismiss it on that alone, but just the concept. I feel like David Lynch

02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.960
would hate it. So I, unless somebody has talked him into it, which great. I don't see this as

02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:51.600
something David Lynch would ever embrace. I just don't. And I mean, granted, I feel like he has

02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.560
ultimate control over the IP because that's why it took so long for there to be a reboot. I suppose

02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:02.160
if paramount own that or Showtime or whatever, now, maybe they could go around them. But I,

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:10.480
I just know if he's not involved, it's going to suck. And that's just the fact. So yeah.

02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.120
Yeah. Bobby Blackwell says that might be, I had a phone call with them once and that's,

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.760
that's a little bit, that's kind of the vibes I get from that. You know, again, if,

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.520
if somebody has convinced David Lynch to make a video game, then fuck yeah, I'm here for it.

02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.320
And honestly, it might be a great way to continue the story of twin peaks because the reality is

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:36.160
a lot of key actors and actresses in twin peaks are dying. They're passing away. The log lady is

02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:43.760
no longer with us. Um, the, one of the prominent, um, FBI folks is no longer with us. David Bowie

02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:50.720
passed away. They kind of found a way around that in the, the, the return, but like video games would

02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:57.680
be a way for the universe of twin peaks to, to live on without having to rely on, you know,

02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:03.680
if certain people are going to be physically able or present to do a twin peaks continuation.

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:09.840
So like if somebody has been able to convince David Lynch of that, then fucking awesome. But

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:15.520
I just, as a big fan of twin peaks, my big reaction is, Oh, David Lynch would never go

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.480
for that. Forget it. Like he'll have to die and it'll be his estate. And that's going to be many

02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:27.280
years. So, um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Babylon five continued last month with an

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:32.080
animated movie and that's how they cast new voices for the actors who passed. Yeah. It's very,

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:36.880
very similar to that concept. So. Wouldn't be too unlike what happened with, uh,

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:45.520
the doctor who, uh, second doctor episodes. Yeah. Yeah. They had to remake them in animation,

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:51.920
but yeah. Uh, Shane in chat says I need more twin peaks media. Anyway, I can get it. I'll take a

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:58.560
game. That PSX demo looked very good. It did look good, but it didn't really look, I don't,

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:03.200
I don't know how fun of a game it is. I feel like the entire, and I don't want to disrespect the

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:08.560
folks that worked hard on that because again, as a fan, I think that's a really great fan project,

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:13.040
but I think that's all it's going to be is a, Oh, that's neat. Oh, look what they did there. Oh,

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:19.840
that's a cool reference. Oh, I love that. It's not going to really build on the universe. If

02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:26.960
we're talking a legit twin peaks video game, I'm expecting that it is continuing the universe and

02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:32.400
the, you know, essentially mythology at this point behind twin peaks and continuing those stories.

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:39.200
I would love to have the ending of the return explained. This is the wild thing about twin

02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:45.760
peaks, the return. If you watch all, but the, the next to last episode, you're like, wow,

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.840
they really brought this full circle. This is incredible. They, I mean, they do it kind of fast,

02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:57.280
but like the way they tie it back to the very beginning is like, Holy shit, this is incredible.

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.000
It's like, he really did know this was it the whole time. And like, it took us, you know,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.040
25 years to get here, but here we are, it was mind blowing. And then you get one more episode,

02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:16.320
the very last episode. And you're like, the fuck was that? What now? What happened? What?

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:23.440
And like the way it ends, you know, very much like the original Twin Peaks series itself. How's Annie?

02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:30.400
Like the way this ends is just like, that is too much of a cliffhanger. And yeah,

02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:35.200
Shane said, that's why I need more. Yeah, same. I would love nothing more than another

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:40.000
Twin Peaks season four. But the more and more time that passes, the less and less

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:47.520
likely it is that it's going to happen unless they, they really do change the year and have

02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:50.720
a completely different cast in there or something. I don't know. I don't know how they do it.

02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:57.520
So we'll see. Anyway. Any other last minute stories, Loki?

02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:00.160
Nope.

02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:04.240
All right. Well, with that, then I think we're towards the end of another episode and we will

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:10.000
start to wrap things up. We'll say goodbye first to Dark Sacras. I believe you're going

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.800
to do your thing. But do you have any final thoughts or party words for us tonight?

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.720
I have a request.

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:19.520
Yeah.

02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:25.920
If anyone is in a thrift store and they see one of the Echo Kitchama jigs, they're like

02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:31.040
these slotted spoon things. Buy it for me, please. I will pay for shipping. I've been looking for one.

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:34.160
Interesting. Is that a slotted spoon?

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:39.760
They're super convenient. It's like a kind of a slotted spoon spatula sort of thing. And it's

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.600
like this Holy grail of kitchen equipment. Cause you can fry with it and do all this stuff. And

02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.160
I super want one. Cause we used to have one when I was a kid.

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:47.760
Interesting.

02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.920
They're like a very neat spoon. If anyone wants to know what it is, just look it up.

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:55.840
All right. We'll have fun with your Dead by Daylighting tonight. We'll see you in a little

02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:56.160
bit.

02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:00.880
Okay. I know that was a random one, but that's the truth. All right. I'll see y'all later.

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:07.120
All right. Take care. Bye-bye. All right. And Loki lap last but not least your final thought.

02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:10.400
Oh, wait, no, wait. Sorry. Before we get to your final thought, let me say,

02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:13.360
thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and downloading our show,

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:16.480
whether you were here live or you were listening to us in the podcast feed.

02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.880
Thank you for being here. Tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:24.640
we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:28.640
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show like Spotify,

02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.720
whatever. That goes an awful long way as well. We really appreciate all of that.

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:37.440
Also, we would really appreciate a follow for VOG Network over not just on Twitch,

02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:43.440
but on YouTube as well, as well as our social medias, both Blue Sky and Twitter.

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:47.600
Loki, now I'll go to your final thought.

02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:56.480
My final thought is tomorrow at noon, New Pacific and 3 p.m. Eastern will be when I debut my

02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:01.920
finale for season two. So look for that. Be on the YouTube feed. It has a premiere

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:09.200
probably later tonight and it will be up on social media later tonight as well.

02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:15.760
If I remember and I don't have a meeting that bleeds into noon, which sometimes happens,

02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.880
I will I will lurk in the channel. That's fine. Or just watch it whenever.

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:25.840
Yeah, absolutely. I'll get you get to those views. All right. Awesome.

02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:30.160
Let's see my final thought tonight. Thanks again to Dragon Con for a great time.

02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:36.160
Looking forward to TwitchCon in a few weeks. And I guess I'm starting Baldur's Gate 3 tonight.

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.720
So I'm going to be doing some playing on my own channel tomorrow with Baldur's Gate 3 after work.

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:47.120
So check that out. That adventure is beginning very soon. Rob Roberts here on Twitch. So that's

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:52.640
going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you all so much for watching

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.280
the show tonight. Appreciate it. Have a good one, everybody. And we'll see you next time. Bye.

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:26.080
Radio, nor fog network, but you know, they were all.
