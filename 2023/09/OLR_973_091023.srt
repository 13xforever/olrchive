00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Cup Noodle announces the greatest innovation in noodles since the instant noodle itself.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,440
Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,180
On the grind, you need a quick fix while you quickly unwind?

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,280
Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Need a pick-you-up that won't thick you up?

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,440
Gaming Cup Noodle, it's caffeinated.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,760
Real talk, would slurp yearly.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,280
This is the RGB package intro.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,760
this and the rest of the two weeks in gaming news, starting right now on the show where

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,240
every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:46,600
Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:54,260
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again, as Jason said there in the intro.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,940
After missing last week, we'll talk about that.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,280
For tonight, September the 10th of 2023, episode number 973, and now live and on the air.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,500
And with me tonight, joining me as always, say hello first off to Dark Sakura or Jamie

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Summers.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Hello.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Hello.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Hello.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
How are you?

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,380
How was your week off?

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
What week off?

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,380
I guess.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,380
Well, technically-

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,380
I did a 13-hour stream.

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
Oh, that's true.

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,380
That's true.

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,020
So you were working, but different type of work.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,640
Yeah, I was working it, but I didn't advertise enough, so only a few people were there.

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,760
But I appreciate the people who were, and I made a bunch of friends during my subathon,

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:44,100
and honestly, it's just the last few series of weeks have just been compostable.

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,400
It's probably was a tricky weekend to do a subathon to with all the stuff that goes on

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,140
for Labor Day, between Dragon Con where I was at, Penny Arcade Expo, I know here locally

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,220
SAC Anime, it's a big convention weekend, and the other types of holiday junk that

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
people do.

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,060
None of that had anything to do with what was going on with my week though.

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,620
I'm just saying the subathon attendance, yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,300
Yeah, I mean, but I honestly, I didn't advertise it enough, and that's really what it was.

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,060
And I mean, given that I have people from all over the world who don't necessarily celebrate

41
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,420
the same holiday or have to deal with our conventions, so it was just all my fault.

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,060
Well, you got to play video games all day though, so hopefully that was still fun.

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,900
All day solo queue.

44
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Wow.

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,900
Except for a little bit.

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,900
I played with a few people.

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,060
All right, well, also joining us tonight, even though he's not on video yet, he is with

48
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
us.

49
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,340
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

50
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,620
Happy early birthday.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,900
I've been here the whole time.

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
That's right.

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
You said what's going on?

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,620
You're not on video right now, but you will be later.

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,100
You're like rendering a video or something?

56
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,220
I am rendering a video that I've been working, editing for literally a month.

57
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,660
Oh, yeah, I've seen your posts about this.

58
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,340
You've been working very hard on this.

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,740
Yes, it's been a whole month that I've been editing this video, and now it is it is done

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,620
well is so done well as Dark Sakura beat me to it.

61
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Happy early birthday.

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
Thank you.

63
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,220
Because I know your birthday is tomorrow.

64
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,500
It's a day that a lot of people remember your birthday.

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,020
And I have a disaster birthday, you know, mine was the Waco thing.

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,480
Whereas my birthday is the day that sodomy laws got overturned.

67
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,760
And there's also the gay marriage legalization day.

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,020
So I have a bit of a celebration day.

69
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,060
Although I will say I also share birthday with Tim Curry.

70
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,060
So there's that.

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,900
Oh, that is that is pretty good.

72
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,100
My big birthday share is Ariana Grande.

73
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:49,620
So who's your big birthday share, Loki?

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,340
Maybe we don't do Wikipedia.

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,020
Maybe we should maybe we should talk about the big event.

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,700
He shares his birthday with no, no, no, like, okay, well, I'm gonna try not to like, put

77
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,500
this in Debbie Downer mode here.

78
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,140
But no, like, so it was a bit of ironic trivia.

79
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:12,020
So I saw the other day, like on on Facebook, it was reminded to me that Steve Irwin passed

80
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,980
on September 4th, which happens to be the day that my mom passed as well as like, Oh,

81
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,980
that's interesting.

82
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,820
They passed on the same day.

83
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,260
But no, I know that's not positive at all.

84
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
Moby.

85
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,260
I mean, that's cool.

86
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,940
Oh, that's doubly cool.

87
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
There's your answer.

88
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,940
There you go.

89
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,940
I'll take that.

90
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,980
And apparently Ludacris and John Ritter.

91
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,620
Oh, wow.

92
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,700
That's one heck of an action movie right there.

93
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
And Harry Connick Jr.

94
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
I love it.

95
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
I say that.

96
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Yeah.

97
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
Oh, hey.

98
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
There's some folks.

99
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,940
Well, Loki, I'm glad you're getting you're getting a YouTube finish for your birthday.

100
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
That's really exciting.

101
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,140
I am I'm going to be premiering it tomorrow.

102
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,260
It is my season two finale of Channel 64.

103
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,340
Yes, the season three is technically started like two or three weeks ago, but it took a

104
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
while.

105
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,380
It is essentially like a mini movie.

106
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:15,660
It is almost 35 minutes long with credits.

107
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:23,660
It is the culmination of all of the lore and S&Ps that I've been on since the beginning

108
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,620
of making Minecraft content.

109
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,580
And it is.

110
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,940
There's a lot of like deeply emotional things that are going along with it, I guess, like,

111
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,380
I don't know, like it sounds really like like depressing, but like it's it's basically

112
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,820
it's there's a lot of themes that go along with it.

113
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,740
And especially if you've watched my older content, then you would catch a lot of the

114
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,460
stuff that's in this one.

115
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,900
There's a lot of like kind of ties back to everything.

116
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,420
It's not only celebrating the lore that I've created in like my stuff, but the lore that's

117
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,060
been created in Channel 64 lore that's been created in other S&Ps that get brought up

118
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,420
in this.

119
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:14,180
It is been the most painful thing I've had to edit because like like put it this way.

120
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,980
So like a normal like Minecraft video that I put together and stuff like has, you know,

121
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,220
it's like it's like say, OK, well, a lot of these more recent ones.

122
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,380
OK, so it seems like, you know, maybe 20 video files, you know, audio wise, there's like

123
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,380
maybe 10 audio clips or something like that.

124
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,300
This one has three hundred forty four.

125
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,580
There's one hundred and eighty.

126
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,580
Last I count, there was one hundred and eighty, one hundred and ninety replay mod shots they

127
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,620
had to create and edit.

128
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,260
But that was probably two thirds of the way through the whole process.

129
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,580
So I don't even know what the new count is, but it's a lot.

130
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,500
So it was a lot of stuff and a lot of special effects things I had to do.

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,900
A lot of AI voices, a lot of voice lines by our voice actors as well.

132
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,180
Just a lot of everything.

133
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,920
But it's very it's action packed.

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,980
It's got emotional beats in there.

135
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,380
It's just got everything.

136
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,440
Well, that is my pitch.

137
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,060
You absolutely need to use your birthday to guilt people into watching it.

138
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,060
So that's what I said earlier.

139
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,260
I said I'm going to earn those guilt or use those guilt points that like get people to

140
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
watch the video.

141
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
Do it.

142
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,260
Do it.

143
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
It's a great time.

144
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
And it really I poured everything into this.

145
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,300
So I hope people enjoy it.

146
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
All right.

147
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Well, we will look for that on the socials tomorrow, including the VOG Network Discord,

148
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,700
where I know you'll post that over at VOG Network dot com slash Discord.

149
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,780
Again, that's VOG Network dot com slash Discord.

150
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,220
A great place to chat with us throughout the week.

151
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,060
Speaking of birthdays, it is so tomorrow is your birthday.

152
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:56,260
But I noticed in chat a reminder that today is Pod Culture's birthday, which is funny

153
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,420
because I actually got to see him at Dragon Con where I was at last week.

154
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,580
So happy birthday, Brad from Pod Culture.

155
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,860
And it was great to see you in person last week.

156
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,740
So I hope you are having the best.

157
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,860
I know you brought back a nasty souvenir from Dragon Con, but I hope you are having the

158
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,620
best birthday possible in light of all that.

159
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,060
And yeah, I hope I hope everything's going great for you.

160
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,500
And Dragon Con quickly.

161
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,620
I will say, you know, I am not going to go too much into depth in Dragon Con because

162
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,340
I've talked a lot about it on this show.

163
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,900
And I want to nudge you over to our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.

164
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,740
Bobby and I not only did a Dragon Con preview show before, but we did a Dragon Con wrap

165
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,700
up show earlier this week.

166
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,820
So if you want to hear all about some of the details and some of our suggestions to make

167
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,300
2024 even better, I'm going to point you in that direction.

168
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,700
But I will just quickly say once again, a big thank you to the video game track as well

169
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,060
as the digital media track for having me back and taking part in some panels.

170
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,140
I got to moderate for the video game track a really cool panel on diversity in video

171
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,300
games.

172
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,420
And the only bummer was that some of our speakers kind of had to back out at the last minute

173
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,220
for whatever reason, you know, whether you know it's sickness or whatever conflict, whatever.

174
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,060
So we only had it was me and two panelists, one who's kind of worked in AAA games, she's

175
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,660
worked on some pretty prominent, you know, like, like Star Wars related things.

176
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,900
And then the other one, she was an indie developer who created, ironically, a game I saw at some

177
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,420
of the Friday gaming Expo.

178
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,580
So I was like, I remember you, I remember your hat and your game and all that stuff.

179
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,140
So but I bring that up because they were great.

180
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,180
And I was really I have to be honest, I was really worried about going into a panel with

181
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,980
just two other people to talk about diversity.

182
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,860
But but oh, they did fantastic.

183
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,500
I was so happy to be a part of that panel.

184
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,820
I thought we had a really good discussion.

185
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,520
So I'm sorry, but not every panel at Dragon Con is streamed, because they kind of want

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
you to go to Dragon Con.

187
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,800
So that one is not streamed.

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,660
So you'll just have to come next year to see a similar panel hopefully.

189
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,520
But the digital media track panels because the content is about digital media, it does

190
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,240
make sense that that is then archived on digital media.

191
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,200
So I will point you over to the YouTube channel for digital media, which is DC Digital Media

192
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
on YouTube.

193
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,740
That's DC Digital Media.

194
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,040
And somebody should probably drop the link here in a moment.

195
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,440
We just put up a YouTube of a panel that Bobby and I did with somebody you might know from

196
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,120
TikTok, who does very well there.

197
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,520
I think he just changed his name as of last week to the fit guy.

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,640
But we all know him as Kurt and or Vobe Kurt, as I joke, because it's actually VO or voice

199
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,560
over by Kurt, but some people say it Vobe Kurt, and I think it sounds cute.

200
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,980
But that panel is it was thriving on streaming media when you're over 40 years old, which

201
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,220
to be honest, a lot of people go, how is that different from thriving when you're 20 and

202
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
30?

203
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
Excellent question.

204
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
We answered in the panel.

205
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,740
So go check it out over on YouTube.

206
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,780
So a shout out for that panel.

207
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,340
So yes.

208
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,740
Okay, that's my plug for Dragon Con related content.

209
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,400
And thanks again for having me.

210
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,260
And I am already planning for 2024, as is Alan.

211
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,420
Alan, remember, this was Alan's first Dragon Con.

212
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,020
And he saw enough in the con, even though he was a little overwhelmed by, I think, just

213
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,740
all the people and all the things there was to do it can it can absolutely be sensory

214
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
overload.

215
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,420
I think sometimes he's like, I see the potential and things I want to do next year.

216
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
So he's gonna come back.

217
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,100
That'd be great.

218
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,480
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

219
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,380
We missed quite a few things this last week, especially because at the same time Dragon

220
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,180
Cons going on, and the arcade Expo is going on as well as some other conventions around

221
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
the country.

222
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,060
And we saw a few headlines that came out from over the long weekend last weekend.

223
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,020
Loki, I don't know if you want to jump into some of these or you want me to take?

224
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
Sure.

225
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
Okay, cool.

226
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,940
Yeah, I don't know too much about the Final Fantasy 16 stuff because I haven't been paying

227
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
attention to it.

228
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,140
But I do remember though, they did make the announcement that they are going to be doing

229
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:02,660
a PC version that is in development and that there is also going to be some two DLCs that

230
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,220
are going to be added as well.

231
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,260
And then they have an update that they've added to the game.

232
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,700
The PC version I'm excited about because then I actually get to play it because I am not

233
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,800
buying a console for a game.

234
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
So sorry.

235
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,140
And people are going to mod the hell out of it.

236
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
So that's going to be interesting.

237
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,900
I mean, yeah, like, yeah, that's how it goes.

238
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,980
How many days until a nude Sid and a nude Clive mod?

239
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,980
Less than zero.

240
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,380
The question is though, do we get nude mod before we get CJ mod from San Andreas?

241
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,340
Which one comes first?

242
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
That's the better question now.

243
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Like nude mod.

244
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Yeah.

245
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Guaranteed.

246
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
CJ mod.

247
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Yep.

248
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Guaranteed.

249
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Which one comes first?

250
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
That's a good question.

251
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,340
That's the new meta.

252
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
We got to start betting on that stuff.

253
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
That's right.

254
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:57,420
But yeah, so they're going to they added an update which gave you a weapon skin feature

255
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,020
and also the onion sword weapon and new outfits.

256
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,540
And then of course, the two paid DLC.

257
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,700
I don't know if they go into detail what those are going to be about necessarily.

258
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,900
They did not talk about specifics, at least as far as I caught about what they will be

259
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
about.

260
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:22,380
There's a lot of speculation that because Leviathan was missing from the, you know,

261
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,260
the lineup of, you know, icons, I keep wanting to say primals because they aren't 14.

262
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,940
They're just like summons.

263
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,220
It's all summons to me at this point.

264
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,660
And honestly, fair, a fair way to look at it.

265
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,940
But that's the speculation.

266
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,380
But then there's also been talk about that they might set it.

267
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,300
It might actually be set either in the time gap, because there is a fast forward between

268
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,100
the prologue and then what you see later in the game.

269
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,500
And or even before the prologue.

270
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,060
So there's talks about that maybe the DLC will actually be a little more standalone,

271
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,260
which could be interesting.

272
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,520
But yeah, I, I'm okay with there being DLC.

273
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,640
I would rather see a 16-2 eventually that could fix some of the issues that 16 had.

274
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,160
Not just technically, but you know, with lack of representation and things like that would

275
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,240
be a great thing to add into the world.

276
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,560
That's why the PC version, you know, we can fix some of that.

277
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,200
Maybe the DLC will address some of that.

278
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,840
Maybe we'll go to another continent and we'll see a little more diversity.

279
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
I don't know.

280
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,240
I think it's really early to say.

281
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
But we'll see.

282
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
We'll see where it takes us.

283
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm glad that in light of the stories, we saw a couple of weeks ago where people were

284
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,560
like final fantasy 16 only sold 3 million copies or whatever it was.

285
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,960
I don't even remember how many copies it was.

286
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Oh God.

287
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Tomb Raider all over again.

288
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Yeah.

289
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
And all that stuff.

290
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Like, I'm glad to hear it is doing well enough where they are talking about DLC.

291
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,760
And I mean the PC version, come on.

292
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,160
We all knew it was, we all knew it was coming and it was just some, some dumb arrangement

293
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,640
that was keeping their lips sealed on that.

294
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
But we all knew that was coming.

295
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
We would never do that.

296
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,400
That's what the, that's what the competition does.

297
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
And that's bad.

298
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,560
We fight against that in the, we would never do that.

299
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
That's awful.

300
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Yeah.

301
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,920
So, um, it's, it's nice to see that that is all confirmed and all that good stuff.

302
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
So.

303
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Yeah.

304
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Yeah.

305
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Uh, yeah.

306
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,840
So I'm excited for, Oh, and the other thing, I know this probably is not on your list,

307
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,920
but I want to say it about final fantasy 16 at PAX.

308
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,720
I was a little jealous.

309
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,480
Usually I am not jealous about the decision to go to dragon con over packs.

310
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,360
I've let my feelings be known on this show.

311
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
It is what it is.

312
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,520
However, Ben star went to packs and I was a little jealous about that.

313
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,760
And not only he wasn't the only one, several of the 16 voice actors all went to packs because

314
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,040
they, they did a panel where all this was basically announced.

315
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,520
So it's a little jealous about that.

316
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,720
And I'm hoping maybe dragon con will get the 16 voice actors next year because I I'll tell

317
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:02,920
you to, I will, I would do just about anything and I mean it to moderate that panel with

318
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Ben star.

319
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,520
I'm just saying just about, but don't get crazy, but just about anything.

320
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
All right.

321
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,920
That's all I have to say.

322
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,800
A little bit confused by, by Ben star.

323
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
You're a little bit confused.

324
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
I actually don't know who that is.

325
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,200
Oh, he's the, he's the voice of Clyde.

326
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:27,120
The Ben star that, cause the Ben star I know of was on a master chef and it was really

327
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
cool.

328
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,640
Uh, no, this is, this is sexy, uh, Clyde voice actor.

329
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Yes.

330
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Who this is.

331
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Yes.

332
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,960
This is the one that Loki said on last, there are two weeks ago show or whatever.

333
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,640
Like, Hey, like even I get it.

334
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,800
I mean, he's an attractive man who has a deep, deep sultry voice.

335
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,440
I mean like, what are you going to do?

336
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,600
What's his, what's his, uh, he has a, he has a Twitter account.

337
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,240
That's where he posts all these things with like, um, you know, pretending to do voices

338
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,800
of Mario and things like that.

339
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,440
He does all these, uh, things and he's just, he's, it's not just his looks.

340
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,160
I mean, but the voice too, it's those things together.

341
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,200
It's, it's very, yes.

342
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
That's all I'm going to say.

343
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Anyway.

344
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Next story.

345
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
All right.

346
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
So they did a Nintendo.

347
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Sorry, sorry.

348
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,680
My, I'm having some lag.

349
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
I apologize.

350
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
No, you're fine.

351
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
No worries.

352
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
No worries.

353
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,880
Um, so Nintendo did a super Mario wonder direct and showed off a little bit more of the game

354
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,360
and some of the different gameplay elements to it.

355
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Actually watch this.

356
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,000
I, it feels like ages ago at this point, but, um, they showed off that this is the flower

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,520
kingdom that you're in now.

358
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,960
So not necessarily the mushroom kingdom.

359
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,880
They have six distinct worlds that are in this game.

360
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,240
And then what's kind of cool about that is there's, um, some of the different levels

361
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,440
that are in there, you can actually tackle in any order that you want.

362
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,720
Um, a little more disappointing though, is the fact that all of the different characters

363
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,040
that they have available.

364
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:07,480
So like Luigi, peach, uh, Daisy, toad, um, and toadette all play the same, which I feel

365
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,280
is kind of like, you know, a missed opportunity.

366
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,600
However, they do have, um, as part of that kind of being more open to gamers that may

367
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
not necessarily be as good.

368
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,360
Um, they have Yoshi and nabbit that have different effects to them.

369
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,520
Uh, that allows the game to be played in a way that, you know, is much easier, you know,

370
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,320
with of course, like the floaty jumps that Yoshi has.

371
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:43,040
And I think also just not really being able to, uh, let's see, yeah, Yoshi, let's see.

372
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,520
You can also ride Yoshi.

373
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,920
Someone else is playing them as well.

374
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
That's kind of cool.

375
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,980
Uh, they showed a bunch of new powerups, uh, like the elephant fruit and you can, uh, blow

376
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,560
bubbles and whatnot with that.

377
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
That's kind of cool.

378
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,160
A very pretty looking game altogether.

379
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,680
And then they also have this weird kind of multiplayer mode where, uh, you actually see

380
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,500
other players running around in the game at the same time and you can even, uh, leave

381
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:16,560
messages for them or like leave icons or it's almost like little cardboard cutouts that

382
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
you leave in the game.

383
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,160
And then if you die, if that bubble hits that thing, then you come back to life or something

384
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
like that.

385
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
I don't know.

386
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
It's interesting.

387
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,360
Um, and then they talked about like kind of the flowers that you can get that kind of

388
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,720
twist everything around and those are in game as well and it looks pretty trippy.

389
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,520
So it's, it's touch fuzzy, get dizzy vibes all over again, but you know, different drugs

390
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,280
this time.

391
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,960
But this is coming out in October on the 20th so it looks pretty sweet.

392
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
I will say it.

393
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
I am definitely picking it up.

394
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
It looks neat.

395
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Yeah.

396
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
It's one of those things like how can you not pick it up?

397
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Like it looks really good.

398
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,000
Um, but, um, I, I do see where it's unfortunate that the characters don't have a little more

399
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,960
of their personality like they did even as far back as super Mario brothers too.

400
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,320
But I get maybe for game balancing and what I really think they're going for, you know,

401
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,240
it's, it's Nintendo's bread and butter.

402
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,520
It's multiplayer gaming on the couch with young kids, hence the nabbit and all that

403
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
stuff.

404
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,500
Like that's very much what they want to go for with this game.

405
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,880
They want something that you unwrap under the proverbial Christmas tree or whatever

406
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
it is you celebrate.

407
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,280
You unwrap it and you go right to playing it with the whole family.

408
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,240
That is very much the game they're going for.

409
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,040
Um, and I think honestly these decisions are going to suit them fine.

410
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,600
The games, the game is going to do very well.

411
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Oh yeah.

412
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Yeah.

413
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Yeah.

414
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I mean, it's a Mario game.

415
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
It is not going to do not well.

416
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,240
Um, and then they're also releasing a special edition switch.

417
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Well, it's not even special edition.

418
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,400
I think it's the red switch that they had a while back with Odyssey.

419
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Um, they're releasing it again now with wonder in there as well.

420
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,720
Um, so neat.

421
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,400
Uh, and then last but not least, uh, volition has been shut down because the embracer group,

422
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,160
you know, as part of their restructuring since they don't have that $2 billion of cash in,

423
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:16,200
you know, being pumped into their business, they have decided to, um, shut down volition,

424
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,360
which um, yeah, I guess that's sad that volition is shutting down, but I mean, is it the same

425
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,320
volition that made some of the earlier saints row games?

426
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
No.

427
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,920
Also, I kind of feel that, you know, being that volition was at a point where they set,

428
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,840
you know, fans were giving them feedback on the game and I get it.

429
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,360
Like fans could be terrible sometimes when it comes to games, but like if everybody's

430
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,520
saying the same thing, like this game looks like it's awful.

431
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,480
I don't like the idea of these main characters just being college kids that are trying to

432
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,360
pay off student loans and then they turn to a life of crime.

433
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,440
That sounds really stupid and not gangsta, um, you know, maybe take that feedback.

434
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,080
It would be like the equivalent of say, for example, the Sonic movie.

435
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,680
If they release ugly Sonic in the trailers, everyone's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

436
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
This seems bad.

437
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
They're like, Oh, that's good.

438
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,160
We're, we're going to keep it like this.

439
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,600
It's better this way.

440
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,320
Like and then being surprised what no one went to the box office to see her awful movie.

441
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,420
I am shocked.

442
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,360
And that's kind of what we have here with saints row.

443
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,480
It was just, it was an awful game premise wise and then awfully executed.

444
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,800
It was like the perfect storm of awfulness and not even in a fun way, like a Bethesda

445
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
way.

446
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,760
Questbuster in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network.

447
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,120
I don't remember if I gave the plug.

448
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,160
We do tape live Sunday nights, of course, at nine Eastern six Pacific over at Twitch

449
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,920
TV slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show and a Questbuster says, Volition

450
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,520
news is sad, but after agents of mayhem in 2017, there were questions on what was going

451
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,920
to happen with the studio.

452
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,360
And that's like, Loki, that's kind of got the vibe I got from your opinion because at

453
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,640
first I was like, Oh, Loki's going to probably be really sad because this is the studio that

454
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
made those earlier saints road games.

455
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,600
But then you were kind of like the same studio anymore.

456
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Yeah, exactly.

457
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,920
They've been going downhill for years.

458
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
So you were unfortunate.

459
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,960
It's unfortunate because like, you know, one of the big champions of like kind of the,

460
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,480
the core saints row games was idle Ninja.

461
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,200
And unfortunately when he passed, it was just any hope that we had left for the studio was

462
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,240
just it died with them, unfortunately.

463
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,280
And it's sad because you would hope that there are people that kind of want to bring that

464
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
back.

465
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
And I get it.

466
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Like they were in a tough position.

467
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,160
Like they had gone way too wacky with Saints Row.

468
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,400
It was just like off the rails crazy at that point.

469
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
They could have dialed it back.

470
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,840
I mean, the whole fact that this is a reboot means you can dial it back to that earlier

471
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
game.

472
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,960
Just all you had to do was recreate the kind of sandbox environment that you have the original

473
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
game.

474
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,000
And it's sort of, you know, mentality is to add a solid story with the earlier games.

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,040
And it had that grit on it.

476
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,460
This has no grit on it.

477
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,200
This is basically stupid characters that nobody likes.

478
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,900
And even worse, like when you actually play through the game, and you actually listen

479
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,480
to your character, like you hate them even more like that is poor writing.

480
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,680
It's poor writing, poor execution, poor everything.

481
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,080
And even on top of all that, like after all of that was done, they publish the game, they

482
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,280
still have the gall to put out DLC.

483
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:26,180
That was about larping like, I'm sorry, larping in a gangster, you know, sandbox game.

484
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,240
What the hell is that?

485
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,840
Like it makes no sense whatsoever.

486
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,800
And they just kept doubling and tripling down on this stuff.

487
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,720
So yeah, they had it coming.

488
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,780
I'm sorry.

489
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,120
But like, if you keep making bad decisions over and over and over again, you're not going

490
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
to be operating anymore.

491
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,160
It sure was interesting how Saints Row showed up on PlayStation Plus, like, a day after

492
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
this announcement.

493
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
You know what I mean?

494
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,200
Plus, wasn't this announcement tied with something like they really tried to sneak this announcement

495
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,660
out there like people would notice.

496
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:03,040
Like I want to say it came out the same time as like, either it was on it released on steam

497
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,520
to like the game released on steam shortly before the seems wrong to the volition news

498
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,360
about the closure that they time that very strange.

499
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
I don't know.

500
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,640
And then I mean, I feel bad for the people that worked for volition.

501
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,240
But at the same time, like, like, I'm sorry, some accountability needs to be had like,

502
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,720
like, yeah, I it feels bad for any developer to close down and the people that are affected

503
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
by that.

504
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,000
Like, because there are a lot of people that like that they were just doing what they're

505
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,860
told and like making the best thing they could do it.

506
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,140
But someone in the chain screwed that up big time.

507
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,020
And I think is more than just like a few people.

508
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,260
It was a lot of people that really screwed the pooch on that one.

509
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,180
So I don't know.

510
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,620
Quest Buster pointing out in our chat volition had some great titles in their history, red

511
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,040
faction, the free space, space, Sims and descent.

512
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,820
But as Loki pointed out, most of the people that came with those likely left.

513
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,820
Yeah, exactly.

514
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,540
And red faction, free space and all that stuff, like, if they would put out more of those

515
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,160
games, like I would have loved to see, like, hey, I have an idea.

516
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,700
If you don't know what to do with Saints Row, then don't do anything with it.

517
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,400
Create a new red faction game and do that like you could have taken that.

518
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,360
Well, I mean, it still may have been bad, but you could have at least taken red faction

519
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,160
and like been able to stick with the space stuff and have an action game based off that.

520
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,640
And that would probably have been more successful than this was.

521
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,280
But they just.

522
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,160
I don't know what they were thinking with this, honestly, because like after we saw

523
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,400
the first really is like, oh, and then after we learned more about the characters, like,

524
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,200
oh, no, no, no, no.

525
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,280
They just kept going with that.

526
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,040
They know like, oh, hey, we're listening to you.

527
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,540
We're taking your feedback. It's like, no.

528
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,920
Goes straight up with what we're doing.

529
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,000
All right. Well, I guess it's one of those things where it's it's

530
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,540
it's a shock, but it's not a shock, right?

531
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,140
It's like, oh, my gosh, they really did close the studio.

532
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,000
And then you go, well, you look at what happened in seven years.

533
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,840
It's not that surprising.

534
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,380
Like the caveat with this, though, is volitions gone.

535
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,760
But that doesn't mean the Saints license is dead.

536
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,180
You can give it to another studio and they can start from scratch.

537
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,940
And I want to say that I thought Gearbox was going to be doing something

538
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,180
maybe with it, but like give it to somebody that like Gearbox,

539
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,400
like whether you like Borderlands or, you know, some of that stuff,

540
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,860
they have pretty good writers that understand context

541
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,280
and understand humor and understand all that stuff instead of just like

542
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,660
making fart jokes all the time like that. It's just awful.

543
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,100
It's bad writing.

544
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,740
And I just think that those folks would have a better time

545
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,500
with something like this because they can have fun with it.

546
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,460
They know how to make a solid engine.

547
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,960
They know how to make a solid game.

548
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,620
Like let somebody competent take it.

549
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,720
All right. Well, that about covers some of the big headlines

550
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,420
we missed from our week off, but we still have to get to this week's headlines.

551
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,840
So we'll get to that shortly.

552
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,300
But first, we're going to get into our gaming weeks

553
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,700
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week

554
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
or in the last two weeks, I suppose.

555
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,120
So let's kick it off. How was your gaming week?

556
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,920
We'll go to Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

557
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,160
It was all right.

558
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,960
What did I play?

559
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,800
I played Cult of the Lamb today to show it off to a friend.

560
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,180
I played, of course, I finished through all of the individual scenarios

561
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,680
for Live Alive.

562
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,480
So I'm actually into like the main part of the end game.

563
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,200
And everything has just frozen on me all of a sudden.

564
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,280
Hello?

565
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,340
I'm here. Sorry, I did notice your avatar is frozen.

566
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,120
Yeah, I don't I don't know what happened.

567
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,160
Just a bunch of stuff decided to freeze on me.

568
00:28:52,160 --> 00:29:00,500
So, but at any rate, I've also we got Godzilla pinball temporarily.

569
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
So we did a little momentary trade for that.

570
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,000
Also, we got Galactic Tank Force, which is amazing and cheeseball.

571
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,920
And like the whole readout part of it is like watching a Sega CD game.

572
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,220
It's pretty it's pretty, pretty rad.

573
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,380
That sounds cool. I don't even know what it is.

574
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,980
Yeah, well, you guys are welcome to come over and play.

575
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,280
I'll see about finding some pictures.

576
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Of course, Dead by Daylight and Disney Dreamlight Valley.

577
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,580
The Godzilla table, though, that is more fun than I thought it was going to be.

578
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,880
And I'm not even kidding.

579
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,880
So, yeah, it's cool.

580
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,380
And of course, it ends in the Go Godzilla!

581
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
You know, when you're done with your game.

582
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,380
Still playing Weird Al.

583
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:58,380
And my stupid wordscape game that I'm I'm feeling angry in a certain way about because.

584
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,380
It just it takes money out of me and I don't want it to happen.

585
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
That table looks awesome. I like it.

586
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,380
I like I like the whole like vintage sci-fi stuff.

587
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
Yeah, it's awesome.

588
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,380
But no, it's it's it's super, it's super good.

589
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,380
Does the table that you guys have, do you have the tank treads on the side?

590
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
We do not.

591
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:27,380
And actually, the thing is, is that it comes with like a big cannon that attaches to the back of the table, you know, in the back glass area.

592
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,380
And when you fold it down, it looks like the tank.

593
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:38,380
I don't know if that's like my jam or not, but it's it's it's a pretty sweet, pretty sweet setup.

594
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,380
And for the record, I'm relaunching all of my camera stuff.

595
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:51,380
So but anyway, I I really, really have just been all over both of these tables.

596
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
There's so much fun.

597
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:02,380
And I I played a little bit of.

598
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:10,380
What was it? It was I don't remember what it was I played it was it was something that I was trying out, but I did buy Baldur's Gate 3.

599
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,380
Because the Mac version is going to officially be out right now.

600
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:25,380
The version that you can play is is the last build for it, like of the betas before they released it.

601
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:33,380
So I'm I'm feeling feeling pretty, pretty OK about it.

602
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,380
OK, I think I see what's happening with my camera.

603
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:48,380
It's. It's just I mean, there's so much stuff for me to play at my house now that I don't even know, like.

604
00:31:48,380 --> 00:32:00,380
What else to play, I have to we've organized the game room now and and I'm really hoping that we can actually get the whole classic game set up back again.

605
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:06,380
So I'm looking forward to to making the best out of that.

606
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,380
But right now, it's just been my usual and a lot of pinball.

607
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,380
All right. Loki, how about you? I know you've been working on a video, but anything else you gave me?

608
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,380
No, I was editing the entire time, unfortunately.

609
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,380
So I did play Minecraft, but in the sense that I was using it to edit.

610
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Gotcha. So, yeah, it was it was only that, unfortunately.

611
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:36,380
It's been busy now, I noticed through the social media is that like the the Minecraft championship not rising is happening soon, right?

612
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:47,380
Because I've seen some of the program this weekend because I've interacted with posts when you were doing it now, like reading replies and stuff that now it pushes all that stuff to my for you page, which I try not to read, but like always defaults to that.

613
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
I can't help but see some of it, you know.

614
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:59,380
So I just I thought the other thought of you, they have a Canon event this weekend on the 16th at noon Pacific.

615
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:14,380
And then there's a special thing that they're doing in collaboration with Twitch rivals at TwitchCon that they're doing an in-person Minecraft MCC thing, although it's supposed to be different, though.

616
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:20,380
That's non-canon. I think it's with fewer players, so I'm not sure what they're doing with that, but that'll be interesting, too.

617
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,380
I almost want to go to TwitchCon for that, but I can't because it's too soon.

618
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,380
I will get B-roll for you or Jamie will, because I it's in our both our plans.

619
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:36,380
So, yeah, maybe that might be something that's five weeks away.

620
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,380
TwitchCon, I can't.

621
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Yeah, that would be something to look forward to maybe next year or something like that.

622
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Yeah, would be cool.

623
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
All right, well, my gaming week.

624
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:54,380
So obviously I was busy with travel to Dragon Con and doing the convention, but, you know, they had a nice arcade there at the convention.

625
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
So it was it was cool.

626
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,380
They kind of had two vendors that were merged together into one long arcade.

627
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,380
They had the joystick game bar, which is like classic games.

628
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,380
I'm trying to remember what I played in the classic arcade.

629
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Oh, Mortal Kombat 2.

630
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,380
I remember playing that because I still I still remember Katana's fatality block, block, block, block, block.

631
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,380
High kick is easy, easy fatality.

632
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,380
And I was I was doing that because I'm a one trick pony with those fatalities in that game.

633
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,380
So I was playing a little bit of that.

634
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,380
And the save point was the group that brought the import games.

635
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:36,380
They actually had a working Technica machine, which I hadn't seen in a while, so I could actually play Flee, which is my favorite song in Technica.

636
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,380
And they they they also had a space Harrier machine.

637
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
So I thought of Jamie again.

638
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,380
I didn't take a picture this time because somebody was playing it when I walked by it.

639
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,380
But yeah, I saw that.

640
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
Wait, YYR?

641
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,380
That was literally your machine I was playing?

642
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
That is funny or used to be.

643
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
I guess that's funny.

644
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
Oh, wow.

645
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,380
What a small world.

646
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,380
OK, well, thanks YYR.

647
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,380
So your your arcade machine got to Dragon Con before you did.

648
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
I want you to think about that for a minute.

649
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
I'm just I'm just messing.

650
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
But that's cool that I played that.

651
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380
But yeah, they had a lot of other like dance games.

652
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,380
Obviously, the dance games were super popular and people were lining up for them.

653
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,380
And, you know, I've played plenty of dance games in my time.

654
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:30,380
I finally ponied up the money to get the Nintendo expansion pack for Nintendo Switch online because I finally just wanted to play some of the Game Boy Advance games.

655
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:40,380
And I played a lot of Mario Advance and Mario Advance 2, which is actually Super Mario 2 is the original Advance and the Super Mario World is Advance 2.

656
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,380
And I was playing a little bit of that.

657
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
So that was a lot of fun.

658
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
I played on that.

659
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,380
And then when I got back, boy oh boy, there's just been games coming out left and right.

660
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,380
So like Dark Sakura, I have picked up Baldur's Gate 3.

661
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,380
I haven't played it yet, though, but that's coming this next week.

662
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,380
You all know the individual in my life that can talk me into buying a game so that we can play it together.

663
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,380
He's very good at convincing people to do things.

664
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,380
So please look forward to that.

665
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:17,380
And also, in addition to that, I picked up Starfield since that is, you know, of course, on Game Pass.

666
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,380
I think many of you were doing what I was doing this week and checking out Starfield, my Game Pass subscription.

667
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
It was weird.

668
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,380
I wasn't sure how I felt about Starfield at first.

669
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:37,380
I was a little bit, you know, especially coming from something like No Man's Sky, which is like relatively simple exploration and very chill.

670
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,380
Like there's a lot more stuff and micromanagy types of things.

671
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,380
It's a Bethesda game, right?

672
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
It's a Bethesda game.

673
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,380
And you have to think about how much you're carrying.

674
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:55,380
When you're setting up the bases, do you have the material the right way to do this and farming stuff?

675
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,380
And what really bothered me was the space flight.

676
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,380
I did not care for the space flight and how much was going into that as opposed to No Man's Sky.

677
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:11,380
Now, granted, the game will let you kind of skip a lot of space flight after the tutorial because you can just fast travel to different places.

678
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,380
So that is nice.

679
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,380
They do put some quality of life things in there.

680
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:23,380
So like I said, I wasn't quite sure I was feeling the game at first, but I really sat down with it.

681
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:30,380
And there was some point where, and again, I'm trying to keep it light on spoilers, but you get a companion pretty early on in the game.

682
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,380
And she wants to go do this certain mission.

683
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,380
And you're in our solar system that we know today.

684
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,380
They call it in the game Sol, S-O-L.

685
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,380
But it's the solar system we know today, except something has happened to Earth.

686
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:52,380
It looks like a big desert now, which probably is just a commentary on climate change and all of that because that's probably more likely than you think.

687
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,380
But nobody lives on it anymore.

688
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:03,380
But you get to go to the moon and your companion actually says, if you want to go land on the moon and just play around a little bit,

689
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,380
which is funny because other people I talked to, I guess, didn't get this dialogue option.

690
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:14,380
But because I went diplomat, I think I get maybe some expanded options and maybe I'm not picking the same things in the dialogue tree that some of you are doing.

691
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,380
So she said, yeah, if you want to go down to the moon, we could do it.

692
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,380
It didn't pop it up, but it's just a suggestion she made. It didn't pop a new quest or anything.

693
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,380
So I went down to the moon. I landed in a very random spot.

694
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:30,380
And then I was just, oh, there's Bobby, there was no, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I have no moon landing spots.

695
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,380
Neither did I. I just picked one.

696
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,380
I just said, we're going to land here and did it.

697
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:41,380
And I went to a very random moon base that was probably procedurally generated.

698
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:47,380
I picked up a quest from some humans that wanted me to go blast some pirates nearby to heaven.

699
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:56,380
And I went and explored this base for like 90 minutes because I couldn't, I didn't, I thought this room had a window over it.

700
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,380
And it turns out it wasn't. You could actually jump through the window.

701
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,380
And so I ran around in circles for like 30 minutes trying to figure this out.

702
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,380
But once I figured it out, I was like, okay, that actually did feel very rewarding.

703
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,380
And that was kind of neat.

704
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:20,380
So I feel like the game is growing on me more, but I just, I get like the overwhelming analysis paralysis that comes with a lot of Bethesda games.

705
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,380
When it's like, there's a table over here and there's crafting you can do here.

706
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:30,380
And there's all these things you can pick up here, but don't pick up too much because you'll be weighted down and lose oxygen faster.

707
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:39,380
But I guess there's, there's plenty of places you can transfer inventory to like your companion or the ship, but it's, it's a lot.

708
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:46,380
But overall, like it's growing on me and my impressions of Starfield are favorable, but it just took me a minute to get there.

709
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,380
So that's kind of where I'm at with that game.

710
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:57,380
One other game I want to talk about, which again, just a random thing that came out in the last couple of weeks that I think for a lot of you is probably going to be blink and you miss it.

711
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,380
And I'm going to mention this game and you're going to say, oh yeah, that did come out.

712
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,380
Watch your, watch your, watch your reaction. Here we go.

713
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:10,380
So I also checked out this week, the digital eclipse.

714
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:25,380
I think they call it gold series look back of the making of Karateka, which the making of Karateka is all about the 1980s Apple II game Karateka, which was ported to the Commodore 64.

715
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
So they, you know, it's, it's very well known for that too.

716
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,380
And it was ported to the Atari, one of the early Ataris as well.

717
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,380
And they actually ported it to some other things too.

718
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,380
The game does get into this.

719
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:44,380
So it's set up similarly to Atari 50 and that they have all these old letters you can read and they have documentary style videos that are spliced in that you can watch.

720
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,380
And they do some really cool things because the whole thing with Karateka and why it was important.

721
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,380
Well, funny enough, fifth dream in chat says, does that tell how it's actually pronounced now?

722
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,380
LOL. Yes and no.

723
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,380
So there actually is a video that directly addresses this.

724
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:08,380
And the creator of the game, Jordan, comes up and says, I call it Karateka.

725
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,380
That's what I always called it.

726
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,380
He says, but apparently everybody else called it Karateka.

727
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,380
And he says, and actually, if you go to Japan, there is no emphasis on any syllable.

728
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:26,380
And most people in Japan called it Karateka, something like that is all like what they would say there.

729
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:34,380
So he says at the end of the day, well, he says, at the end of the day, I really don't care which one you use.

730
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,380
They're all correct to me. Thank you for playing the game.

731
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,380
That's basically what he says.

732
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:44,380
So he, which is what I wish the gift guy would have done quite honestly, but it is what it is.

733
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,380
So he has said he accepts all pronunciations of the game and that is the official answer.

734
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:56,380
So I just say Karateka because that's just, but it's funny because they interview professionals and other developers and things.

735
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,380
And there is somebody in the video who says, well, I just always thought it was karate and then kah.

736
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,380
So I always say Karateka and I was like that.

737
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
That's it. Same brain.

738
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,380
That's where my brain always went when I was younger.

739
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,380
So, yeah.

740
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,380
So that was that was it was neat that it answered questions like that.

741
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:20,380
But some other neat modes is that like the whole reason why it was infamous in gaming was that it was really a step forward for cinematic games.

742
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:26,380
And the way this is all laid out and the story that it tells in the game really lays that out.

743
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,380
And it's because Jordan used a and I'm not remember his last name in the minute.

744
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,380
Belkner? I might be getting that wrong. I'm very sorry.

745
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,380
He's also the same guy that made Prince of Persia.

746
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:46,380
Meckner. Thank you. Jordan Meckner made the game and he used a trick that old Disney animators used in Snow White called rotoscoping.

747
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,380
So he actually shot his dad filming different karate things.

748
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:59,380
He had a karate teacher do some stuff, but they didn't have that actual Super 8 film footage, but they had his dad climbing up onto the hood of the car.

749
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:06,380
And they showed how that actually became the protagonist climbing up the cliff in the first scene of the game.

750
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:14,380
And they used rotoscoping, which is basically putting traceable paper over the Super 8 footage one frame at a time to basically make the sprites and clean that up.

751
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
And that's why that game was so fluid.

752
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:26,380
But they also talk about other ways that that game became more cinematic and it talks about how Choplifter was very inspiring and making the more cinematic.

753
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:38,380
It really tells the story about how he did these earlier games. He was trying to sell a game called Death Bounce, which was essentially, long story short, an asteroid clone.

754
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,380
Copy copy, like just refined, refined, refined to its whole new thing that he just really wasn't able to sell to Broderbund.

755
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,380
And he just kind of had an awakening when he played Choplifter. He said, Why am I trying to make an arcade game?

756
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:54,380
Video games now because they are on computers and you own them, they can be cinematic experiences.

757
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,380
And so he decided he was going to make a cinematic game. And that's where Karateka came from.

758
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,380
And how he ended up making that game.

759
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:10,380
And then at the very end, it kind of teases that like, Prince of Persia was the next game, but that's another story.

760
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,380
Wink wink nudge, like the series might explore that as well in the future.

761
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,380
Yeah, Bobby points out he wanted a game that ended with the end and not game over.

762
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:26,380
But anyway, the making of Karateka does a very good job because you can play like they talk about all of these prototypes.

763
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,380
And if you want to play the very original prototype that Jordan Meckner sent to Broderbund, you can play that prototype.

764
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:39,380
If you want to play his asteroid clone that he made, you can play that. If you want to play Death Bounce, you can play that.

765
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:47,380
And then they actually did reimagined. So digital clips made reimagined versions of Death Bounce and Karateka.

766
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:53,380
And they're both very good for reimagined games. I know digital clips has been in the game for a while.

767
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:59,380
But whoever worked on those reimagines, especially the Death Bounce reimagining, because that game never was released technically.

768
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:07,380
Because they just didn't see a releasable, well, they saw a releasable game in it, but they wanted to make all these changes that Jordan didn't really want to do.

769
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,380
So you can go in and play that. And I thought the remastered Death Bounce was really cool.

770
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,380
And yeah, Bobby points out, you can actually watch somebody else play the game and jump in at any point.

771
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:29,380
There's apparently 14 different games in there. But it's when I say different games, it's like 10 of them are Karateka and two of them are Death Bounce and two of them are the asteroid clones.

772
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:34,380
So it's really just a handful. But you can play the Commodore 64 clone.

773
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:46,380
And they actually have the developer of the 64 version of Karateka named I think Veda Cook is her name, which she's trans.

774
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,380
And so she's not credited appropriately in the old version of the game.

775
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:56,380
So I was surprised that they did not go back and fix that in the Commodore 64 version of the game.

776
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:02,380
But perhaps they couldn't at this point. I don't know what happened to the source code. It could be lost to time or something of that.

777
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:14,380
But I thought it was very cool because she explains her relationship with Jordan, and how she was basically handpicked to do the Commodore 64 port and the Atari port, which I thought it was just a really good story.

778
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:21,380
So there's lots of really good stories. The way it was all laid out like a museum, I really enjoyed as well. It was really like an interactive museum.

779
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:28,380
So anyway, I know I'm talking a lot about this game. And you know, Bobby and I've talked about maybe doing a deeper dive video for the network later on.

780
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:37,380
So I should save some thoughts for that. But I will just say I was I was very impressed by this. And for 20 bucks. It's not a bad deal. I'm gonna be honest.

781
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:45,380
I don't I did play Karateka on the Commodore 64. I didn't like it as a kid. I thought it was too hard. I thought it was too difficult. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

782
00:46:45,380 --> 00:47:00,380
And I thought it was too difficult. They never got very far. But going through this experience gave me an appreciation of like, Oh, okay, I see why like this is important. I see how this got to this and gaming.

783
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:07,380
And the fact that you know, the museum element, the documentary stuff kind of told its own story, I thought was really well done.

784
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:17,380
Now I do have some places I would give constructive feedback. But I'll save that for another time because I've talked about this long enough. But I think there's there's some parts that were glossed over a little bit for me.

785
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:36,380
And I'm just wondering if it was a rights issue or what, because, okay, I'll quickly say he made another game that they mentioned and they show a couple screenshots of but I really felt like that game seemed like a bridge on how he was able to design the cinematic stuff that he made.

786
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:50,380
And they don't really ever get into much detail about that. I thought that was a little weird. But maybe it's a rights issue. Maybe you know, because it belonged to another company. I don't know. But I just overall I mean, the issues I have with it are pretty nitpicky.

787
00:47:50,380 --> 00:48:04,380
And for a first release in a goldmaster series. I'm really curious what other games they've got lined up, because they call it number one. It's even on the logo of the game goldmaster number one. So you know, they've got a queue of other games they're going to do.

788
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:29,380
Now, I can theorize a guess what some of the other games could be Prince of Persia is an obvious one. However, I thought it was interesting. They interview john Tobias from Mortal Kombat. I'm not sure why they're interviewing I mean, maybe because he also made a martial arts game. But what if you were interviewing him for something else? And you just decided to ask a few questions about karateka as well.

789
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:57,380
By the way, I if they do if they I don't know, again, right. So just if they were to do one for the original Mortal Kombat, because you know, all that motion cap stuff is out there. We were talking about this with Dragon Con last year, one of the panels that Bobby got to do. There was some behind the scenes footage of them doing the mocap that they actually showed that had like never been seen before. And you know, when I kind of put that together with what I was watching in the karateka thing, I was like, Oh, fuck, I hope that I hope Mortal Kombat one is like their next museum thing.

790
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:18,380
Because that would be incredible. Again, I don't know how rights issues would play into that. So it is a pie in the sky thought that would be amazing. I also noticed they had somebody from ID software, also seemingly randomly interviewed, who happened to be showing off a five and a quarter floppy with return or return to Castle Wolfenstein on it. And I was like, hmm.

791
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:47,380
That would be cool Castle Wolfenstein 3d could be a very interesting one. So anyway, all my all my thought is, is like, I hope there are more. So I do do check this out. If this sounds appealing to you, and show digital clips and the folks that are involved that we are wanting more of these because I thought it was well done. And I'm really excited for the potential of some of these other things. Again, I am completely making educated guesses based on what I'm doing.

792
00:49:49,040 --> 00:50:18,260
These seem to be random people being grabbed for an interview, but maybe it's not that random. But we'll see. We'll see. Fifth Dream in chat says just do every game for real. No, but really, though, like, there's probably a lot of other deep cuts, I would have never thought of to do this, you know, I would have never thought I needed a look back at karateka. Just like I said, when I was a kid, I didn't know better. I didn't have the appreciation for games that I do now. I didn't care for it. And so I haven't thought about it

793
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:47,860
since. But thanks to this experience, I've kind of gone, oh, wow. Like I this is okay. I get why this game was important. I get the impact that it had on other people. And I get the story about this. And I mean, I think that says it all right there on why they wanted to do this in the first place. So alright, that's plenty for me. I've talked a lot about that game. So but I had a feeling a lot of you would be like, oh, yeah, that came out. Just reminding you because don't don't miss it. We want to see more in this

794
00:50:47,860 --> 00:51:17,660
series. I think we really do. It is out on switch PC and PlayStation. I'm not sure about Xbox question marks, somebody would have to fact check that and verify. I picked it up on PS five personally. Because I was just like, I like my PS five. And I thought trophies might be fun. And I unlocked like two trophies. So sadly, no trophy for getting 100% on the museum. I thought for sure that would be a thing, but that's all right. Okay, let's move on and get into some of the

795
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:25,740
other gaming news from this week. Loki, we will go over to you. Oh, thank you. Why? Why are who says yes, it's on Xbox. Thank you. Okay, yeah, Loki.

796
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:55,740
Yeah, so let's talk about PlayStation Plus, since you know, Saints Row just recently was added to that as well. It's getting more expensive, because you know, that's what happens nowadays, everything just gets more expensive, for no discernible reason whatsoever. But they're going to be breaking down, or they're going to be raising the prices across the board for each of the different tiers, and some even more expensive than $20. So right now, we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about PlayStation Plus, and we're going to be talking about

797
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:25,740
PlayStation Plus, and we're going

798
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:55,740
to be talking

799
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:25,740
about PlayStation Plus.

800
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:55,740
So

801
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:25,740
if

802
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:55,740
you

803
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:25,740
have

804
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:55,740
a

805
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:11,820
game pass ultimate, like that's $17 a month US, that ends up being $204 a year. That's a lot. I mean,

806
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:19,020
when you break it down like that, that is quite a bit, that's more than what Sony's service is, but

807
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:24,220
like, I don't know, it just doesn't seem that bad to me, and maybe if you like break it down,

808
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:29,500
$70 game right now, I only have to do that three times through the year to technically get the

809
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:36,540
value out of it, right? That's true. Yeah, that's what it is. I think so. And I mean, from what I

810
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:41,260
understand with Sony service is they're not putting their first party games on there right

811
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:46,540
away. They're not day and date with launches, if I'm correct, because they want you to buy those

812
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,300
because they feel that their games are worth the money, and they want you to pay the money,

813
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,700
even though you pay for their service, but they want you to buy it upfront. And then later on,

814
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:59,020
if they're gracious enough, they'll give it to you for free. And to be fair, I would say Sony

815
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:04,620
is probably worth the money, but so are the things that Microsoft is putting out, you know? Exactly.

816
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:11,820
So yeah. Shane is in our chat. Chad Leland says, I actually canceled my renewal because their

817
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:16,940
justification of the increase is pathetic and vastly overstated the quality of their offerings.

818
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:23,100
No more online games or extra games. I'm tired of arrogant Sony this generation. That last sentence

819
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:30,700
says a lot. And I think I agree with it a lot is that is I'm also tired of arrogant Sony this

820
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:37,820
generation. And I don't like to root for people getting L's in the gaming industry because I know

821
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:43,420
a lot of people get affected by that. I don't like to say such sweeping things. It's like,

822
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,220
everybody there ought to be fired. That's not how we really feel. And I know that like you

823
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,860
were saying earlier during the Volition story, people that didn't make the decisions on where

824
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:59,660
to go with the story were impacted by the game. And that's too bad. But there comes a point where

825
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:07,980
I'm like, you know what? When the PSVR2 flops, I'm not going to be sad for Sony. Well, the way I see

826
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:14,380
it like this is desperation breeds innovation. Because if they're put in last place, like they

827
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:20,700
were with like PlayStation 3, they tried harder when PlayStation 4 came out. That's when we got

828
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:26,380
LittleBigPlanet and like some really rad games, right? So like, yeah, I think Sony should feel

829
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:32,220
the heat a little bit. And it's I'm not sure they learned from what happened with the PS3.

830
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:39,340
Because this is this carries a very similar weight to the phrase 599 US dollars.

831
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:46,060
It doesn't make it because like, they're consoles expensive. They're like, like,

832
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,700
just even the proposition of PlayStation VR right now, like, I've completely just given up any sort

833
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:58,940
of hope to actually play you know, that my wonderful spiritual successor to Until Dawn

834
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:05,100
Rush of Blood, because I'm not buying the system and the VR for like, was it gonna be

835
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:12,940
close to $1,000 at that point, like, oh, thanks, I'm good, you know. And I just will skip Sony this

836
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:18,140
generation. And honestly, like, considering how much I play my Xbox, which is not at all,

837
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:24,140
it's in a box. I'll just skip consoles this next generation too, because PCs the way they go,

838
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,580
like, I get the best of everything, I get all of the games, none of this BS about paying for

839
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:33,820
multiplayer online. And like, if they start pulling this, I'm like, okay, well, I'll just

840
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,340
play thousands of other games that are available all through all these marketplaces, because

841
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:44,300
competition and competition pushes those prices down, you have a walled garden, you got to pay

842
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,620
whatever they're telling them to pay. Bobby's needling you in chat say you only play Minecraft

843
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:53,980
anyway. That is true. And to be fair, you are absolutely correct. I am hyper focused on

844
00:59:53,980 --> 01:00:00,940
Minecraft. But I but that is to say, you know, in because I have a horrible habit of doing this,

845
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:08,460
I still buy a lot of games, I just don't believe them. But I buy lots of games on PC. Yeah,

846
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:13,980
then I'll play eventually, you know, when I retire, I'll be dead before that happens. But

847
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:19,260
you know, like, it'll be just, you know, don't be there so that somebody can play them someday.

848
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,060
Or I will just collect them like you would like, I don't know, bobbleheads or something.

849
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,460
Shane and chat says, Remember when everyone was crapping on Nintendo for their service and price?

850
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:33,020
It honestly feels like the best value to me right now for the price the NSO plus expansion?

851
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,620
Yes, I do remember that because I was one of the people crapping on it. But I will say I thought

852
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:41,580
you'll notice two years later, I finally did sign up this week because I was like, you know what?

853
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:47,980
Yeah, they've added a lot to NSO. And you know, on N64 in advance, and even just you know, I was

854
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:52,220
like, Oh, I could get those Mario Kart tracks and stuff for free. You know what? Fuck it. I'm gonna

855
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:57,100
finally sign up for that. So it took me a little while to get there. But like, yeah, like, honestly,

856
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,700
and then the other thing I just want to say with PS VR two real quick is that you know, and I've

857
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:05,820
said this before, but I'll say it again. It's very sad that Sony is not learning this lesson because

858
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:10,620
I really feel like the PS VR two is destined for the similar fate. The PlayStation Vita,

859
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:17,100
the PlayStation TV, it's a terrific piece of hardware, horribly supported by Sony.

860
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:24,380
And I don't I don't understand why they need to like, honestly, like, I think the best course

861
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,900
of action for Sony and something like that. And it's like, I get it, you got to push those

862
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:32,780
graphics and everything. But you got to develop something like the meta quests, like, honestly,

863
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:40,060
because that is as much as I hate meta, like, that piece of hardware is like my kids play that

864
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:46,540
all the time, like all the time. And they love it's just so easy to use. And it's it's decent

865
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:52,780
enough to run games in, you know, pretty decent games. So all they need to do is just something

866
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:58,220
like that that's not attached to a $500 console. And I get it like, you know, it pushes the

867
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,540
graphics and stuff, but is it really worth it to like be that high end on that? Because like,

868
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:06,940
you're really narrowing the market. Like if you expand it, make it more broad, you can have that

869
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:12,380
thing take off like, you know, imagine Sony titles on like, you know, a quest type of product

870
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:17,180
where it's easy, you know, it's like a couple 100 bucks to get in and then you're playing the Sony

871
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:22,700
catalog stuff like that's what they need to do not wall it off with $1,000 worth of how well is

872
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:29,340
that going to work for for Apple with their thing like that's an amazing piece of hardware. But it's

873
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:34,620
just like no one's gonna buy it because it's so expensive. And that's the thing. It's we're

874
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:38,860
waiting for all these prices to come down. It's just, I don't know, I think they need to do

875
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:42,540
something that's its own thing. I want to get a couple other comments out here. And then I'll

876
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,340
move on to the next story for time. But crystal skies in our chat. Hello. Hello says they need

877
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:52,620
to make it backwards compatible, you know. And that was a problem is that they did make a

878
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:57,180
hardware design choice to it. They can't make it backwards compatible because the VR works in a

879
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,540
completely different way. And that's why you're seeing things like no man's sky, Tetris effect

880
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:07,020
and things getting like re released for PS VR, too, because they really are new releases,

881
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:12,380
because they have to adapt to the new way that PlayStation VR to handles VR versus the first

882
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:17,820
that was a choice they made. And you know, I, I get why they did it, because that's where the

883
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:22,780
tech is going. And it does allow them, you know, probably a better VR experience at the end of the

884
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,420
day. But yeah, it does suck. Like it's just like that. And that's the way a lot of people see it

885
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,820
is that comment right there. So yes,

886
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:34,860
yeah, it's the problem is what it's always been is some of these consoles that they put out,

887
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:40,380
you know, and I'm considering this like a console almost for Sony is they don't have the must have

888
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:46,780
system seller game on it. I'm sorry, the horizon game. That wasn't it. Like that was just not

889
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:51,340
experience, though. I did get to mess around that it's Yeah, and Bobby and Chad says the tech and

890
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:56,940
PS VR two is pretty good. It really is. Like if they just would put the first party games behind

891
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:01,820
it to really sell it, like give it a half life Alex or something, you know,

892
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:06,380
like a God of War game, like where your cradles and you're throwing the axe and stuff like that,

893
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:11,980
like that could be really sweet. Give it a Spider Man game like is swinging around on a web and

894
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:18,220
stuff like that. It sounds motion see your I get it. I get it. But like, some people might like

895
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:25,580
that. Like you could do something like that. It would be really cool and just but it's unfortunately

896
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:29,660
it's gonna go the way like a lot of these Sony products do is where they just kind of forget

897
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:35,500
about it and it goes off and then we're like, you know, several summer game fests down the road and

898
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:39,500
we're like, Hey, where's all those PlayStation VR two titles and then the next thing you know,

899
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:45,260
oh, yeah, we stopped supporting it. What Vita you know, one more comment in chat here. Shane says

900
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:49,820
PS VR two already feels dead. They never talk about it. I don't even know about things coming

901
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,740
out for it because they don't talk about it. I can't follow every developer making games for it.

902
01:04:53,740 --> 01:05:01,180
So the games just go unnoticed since Sony ignores it. Ouch, but true. All right, let's move on. Our

903
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:06,140
next story is about kind of an update. Excuse me to something we talked about two weeks ago on the

904
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:12,700
show. And that is the fact that as we know, Charles Martinet will no longer be voicing Mario. There is

905
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,620
a new voice actor in Mario wonder they are still not saying who that is. I guess we just get to

906
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:20,540
find out when the credits roll in the game. What if it's the Final Fantasy 16 guy?

907
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:26,780
Oh, it's not it's not. And like I said, I, I understand why they kind of are keeping it under

908
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:33,020
wraps because that person is going to get bullied, unfortunately, and it sucks and they shouldn't I

909
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:39,020
want to make it very clear that type of behavior online is fucked up. But unfortunately, they don't

910
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:44,140
get but if they're not, they will you you hang out on Twitter, they're absolutely going to get

911
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:49,020
bullied because they're not Charles Martinet. They're gonna because the environment created on

912
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:54,860
Twitter by the person that runs Twitter only lends itself to hyper focusing that environment.

913
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,300
They have to be on Twitter. I hopefully they're not just not making an account there that that

914
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:06,300
would be the smart move. Yes. I agree with that. I mean, more and more and more people even,

915
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:13,420
you know, verified people are leaving the platform anyway. So I, I don't know. Um,

916
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:21,900
I honestly think that there'll be those of us who are like, I'd say the true fan. But those who will

917
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:30,220
be like, welcome to the family. Yeah, you know, I am I would rather focus on, you know, I think that

918
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:34,860
if the people who are like welcoming speak louder than the people who are haters, and that's going

919
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:39,660
to make all the difference. That's a very good point is that, you know, we can, you know, send

920
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:44,860
some love to counteract all of that negativity that we know is coming. The part I want to say

921
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:48,540
with that, though, is that I don't think it's a good decision on Nintendo's part to make people

922
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:54,060
wait until the credits because that information will get leaked as soon as those press coffees

923
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:58,220
are out there coffees copies are out there, it doesn't matter what embargo you put on it,

924
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:03,740
that name will leak out. So Nintendo, my question to you is, do you want to control the narrative?

925
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:08,140
Or do you want Twitter to control the narrative? Because right now, out of Doug Bowser's mouth,

926
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,220
I'm hearing I want Twitter to control the narrative. I think that's a poor decision.

927
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:19,420
So I do hope Nintendo will allow this new voice actor to be properly introduced before the game

928
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:25,260
comes out. But that's my thought. But anyway, a nice video that they did do was that they

929
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:30,780
actually did a video with Charles Martinet and Miyamoto. There wasn't really new information

930
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,620
in it. They were just kind of, you know, talking about Charles Martinet's new roles, the ambassador,

931
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:38,460
and you kind of got to hear it out of his mouth where Charles Martinet was like,

932
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,020
hey, I'm really happy to be doing this role. It's been an honor to be voicing Mario for years,

933
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,700
but I'm so excited to come to conventions and meet all of you. It was a very nice thing. It

934
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:51,500
was the kind of thing where I'm kind of surprised they didn't release that with the news two weeks

935
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:57,420
ago. But okay, it is what it is. And it's coming out now. Plus, I think I think it was very nice

936
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:04,060
of Charles Martinet to be a good sport. Because technically, he wasn't required to be but I get

937
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,740
that he wants to continue this good relationship with Nintendo. And he, you know, to be fair to

938
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:15,180
Nintendo, they were treating him better than unfortunately, a lot of voice actors get treated

939
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,500
in this industry. Like I was literally just looking at Jennifer Hale's Twitter the other day,

940
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,740
and she just casually said, Oh, yeah, I got replaced on this cartoon I was on because they

941
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:28,460
didn't want to pay union rates anymore. She's like, and that's, you know, that's how I found

942
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:32,620
out when the new season got announced with the with the new voice actors, you know, and so a lot

943
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:37,340
of voice actors are not treated very kindly in this industry. So I will give credit to Nintendo

944
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:43,100
that like they they made a decision. They're sticking to it. They're handling it with grace

945
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:49,580
best they can. So I will give them all of that. But like I said two weeks ago, if you really want

946
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:53,100
to show Charles Martinet how much you love him, pay him for a monograph when he comes to your

947
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:57,020
town. Pay him for an autograph and a selfie when it comes to your town. That is the best way to

948
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:05,420
express your love. So there you go. Ah, yeah, thank you. Totally spies. Thank you, Rama.

949
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:11,660
Appreciate that. Anyway, let's move on. We have some more news. Dark Sakura.

950
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:26,460
There we go. Now my unmute button is working. So I heard you. So this is a I mean, honestly,

951
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:33,260
I'm not surprised by it because it's Nintendo. But they have said that there are no plans

952
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:42,140
for any DLC for Tears of the Kingdom. I mean, they hardly had DLC for Breath of the Wild. So

953
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:47,980
I wasn't expecting anything. I always expect Nintendo to bring out, you know, if they're doing

954
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:54,860
a game. They're going to do a whole game. Breath of the Wild had DLC. Breath of the Wild had DLC.

955
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:58,380
I said it had it barely had deals. Oh, you're right. Yeah, barely.

956
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:03,260
I also just found a string piece of string cheese that's been on my desk since last night. Oops.

957
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:08,540
Here's some deals right there. It's an unopened string cheese. But anyway, back to this.

958
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:15,580
Basically, and this is the quote from Al Numa. There are no plans to release additional content

959
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:20,300
this time because I feel like I've done everything I can to create games in that world.

960
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:26,300
In the first place, the reason why we chose this time as a sequel to the previous game is because

961
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,980
we thought there would be value experience and new kind of play in that place in Hyrule.

962
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:36,540
Then, if such a reason is newly born, it may return to the same world again. This is translation

963
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,340
clearly. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play. So

964
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:47,180
I'd be happy if you could look forward to it. Translation is we don't want to provide you with

965
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:51,580
more items to build things out of because you've already made so many pornographic things already.

966
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:05,020
No, I just think that when Nintendo puts out a game, a first party game,

967
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:14,060
they tend to put out a fairly complete project that fulfills the goal they set out as far as

968
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:21,740
storytelling and experience. I don't know, I've never expected DLC with first party Nintendo

969
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:28,780
games. When the stuff came out for Breath of the Wild, I was pretty surprised, honestly.

970
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,700
It's not something like Splatoon that would be something that's a continuous, ongoing,

971
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:43,260
non-singular story. This is its own entity. Honestly,

972
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:49,660
I have no problem with this. Y'all ain't entitled to extra shit, y'all.

973
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:55,500
I actually would love to see DLC on older games, like the original Zelda,

974
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:00,700
let's give me a third and fourth quest, or new characters to play as.

975
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:04,380
You know the fan community is already taking care of that with the randomizers.

976
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:09,340
I get that. I get that. But it would still be cool. They do the save, save things,

977
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:13,420
which is fine. But it would be really cool to just, okay, let's do these things that we can

978
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:18,060
push. We couldn't have done on the Nintendo because we didn't have the memory space,

979
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,900
but now we can push it. DLC for Animal Crossing for GameCube.

980
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:27,260
Super Mario 35 is what I'm hearing. That technically is the old game with the new

981
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:32,060
twist, right? Which I don't know why it was limited time. And you know there's rumors,

982
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:36,300
rumors that F F zero is going to get a 99 game.

983
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:44,860
But I definitely agree with what Jamie said about like, Nintendo games are,

984
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,500
it's an accurate statement, Nintendo games are pretty fully featured. And we don't,

985
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,460
we think of Nintendo as a company that releases relatively bug free, like I shouldn't say 100%

986
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:59,340
bug free, relatively, yeah, relatively, compared to some of their peers. They do very good with

987
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:02,220
that and always doing like a fully featured type of product.

988
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,340
If something's going to have that Nintendo seal of approval on it, it's going to have earned it.

989
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:13,100
But that that is true. And I would say it's also true that when they do decide to do DLC,

990
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:18,380
it's also a pretty rich and excited like, you know, like, you know, the Breath of the Wild.

991
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,740
So I can see where maybe there's that disappointment of like, ah, Nintendo set the

992
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:26,540
bar so high with DLC, it's a bummer, they're not going to go through it with this. But it's not

993
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:30,220
like it's going to hurt the game in the long run, because the game itself is fully one of these

994
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:33,740
days, I'll get around to playing it is fully featured. And you know, you're not going to be

995
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:38,860
disappointed. And it's because they're working on a switch to anyway, like at this point, like,

996
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:44,060
you're not going to do it because the switch to would be out by the time this DLC would

997
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,540
hypothetical DLC would come out anyway. So they're just

998
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,580
releasing a Breath of the Wild.

999
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:53,980
No, that's true. Well, Breath of the Wild ended up being a dual release. So yeah,

1000
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:59,740
they could they could, you know, date, they may say that, yeah, we're not releasing DLC.

1001
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:07,980
There could be a special edition that comes out that has more content in it. That's technically

1002
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:14,620
not DLC and technically is the best type of being right. 100 clip that we're going to be watching

1003
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:19,260
this in six months when that's true. That is it. That's why there's no DLC.

1004
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,220
Hmm. Maybe.

1005
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:26,860
Maybe. All right. Well, since we brought up switch to why don't we go to our next big rumor?

1006
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,020
Well, okay.

1007
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,220
Well, I'm sorry. Was there more?

1008
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:35,900
Well, I know I had another another thought about it, too, is just that

1009
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,940
Sorry, it's harder for me to see the avatar raising a hand than a real person. So

1010
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,780
it's okay. It's just that I forgot what I was gonna say. So nevermind.

1011
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,320
Okay.

1012
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,240
I got totally distracted off of my thought.

1013
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:58,320
Okay. So there's rumors that last month during Gamescom that developers were shown a switch

1014
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:06,640
to behind closed doors. Basically, allegedly, yes, your gamer had said that partners were shown tech

1015
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:13,920
demos of how well the system is designed to run. And is there is one such demo was a souped up

1016
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:24,480
version of Zelda Breath of the Wild. Ironic, ironic that they would be doing that. Lots of

1017
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:31,600
rumors regarding specs and stuff that I've seen too. But I don't want to speculate in specs,

1018
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,320
ray tracing and DLSS and all that stuff like that. We'll see what they come out with

1019
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,720
when they announce it, which will happen eventually, after the holiday.

1020
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:44,480
Yeah, I mean, they're not gonna cannibalize holiday sales. No way I have anything about

1021
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:51,520
this. No, it's not holiday for sure. I mean, it next year, maybe. Next holiday, possibly.

1022
01:15:52,160 --> 01:16:01,120
But yeah, I mean, we'll see. We'll see. Dr. CSA, supposedly, it ran the UE five matrix demo. Well,

1023
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,560
that the rumor, you know, I know, you don't want to get into specs. I understand why it's all

1024
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:10,400
rumor anyway. But the rumors are saying it's PlayStation five level quality, but able to do

1025
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:15,040
what the switch does, which would be pretty impressive, if true. That would be cool. Yeah,

1026
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:21,280
I don't believe it. But that would be cool. Yeah, I take this as a very big grain of salt. I mean,

1027
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:26,560
what I don't take with a grain of salt, a switch to is coming. Absolutely. The grain of salt part

1028
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,920
is I think Nintendo is probably still trying to finalize those specs. And I think maybe I would

1029
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,280
believe that they showed it to trusted partners at Gamescom to get feedback on some of that.

1030
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:43,040
What would it take? What what kind of power do you need to bring us this game on the console?

1031
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:48,720
What do you need to do this sort of thing? I think the specs are still being negotiated. And they

1032
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:53,840
might have shown the higher end of things. But I don't think that necessarily means it's the final

1033
01:16:53,840 --> 01:17:00,800
product. So yeah, there's a lot a lot of that stuff still to be figured out. Okay, another

1034
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,800
thing that kind of dates back to Gamescom a little bit, but this was this Pikmin Finder AR

1035
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:12,560
game that came out. It's not Pikmin Bloom. And it's not Pokemon Go. But it's another Nintendo

1036
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:18,000
and Niantic partnership. It's Pikmin Finder. It's an AR game that lets you scan the environment for

1037
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,880
Pikmin and treasures. There's a little link, it's pikmin-finder.nintendo.net. And you go on it on

1038
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,520
your mobile device, you do a little QR code. And that's that's how you get it all started.

1039
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,120
Essentially, honestly, I haven't really played around with this because it's just a way to just

1040
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,760
scan the environment that they're trying to like scan people into like doing more 3D scans of

1041
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:45,280
locations and stuff like that. No, but Niantic also already has a game like this called Peridot

1042
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:51,680
that they put out. And I played Peridot for about a week. And because there's there's no game there.

1043
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:56,560
It's one of those things that's like, oh, that's interesting for about three days. And then you're

1044
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:04,800
like, okay, I've seen it all done. And the the monetization in that game is horrific. Horrific.

1045
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,360
So I I'm, you know, you all know, I used to bang the drum on Niantic games here. I just want to

1046
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:17,840
point out I'm uninstalling some of their games left and right. I my, my subscription in Ingress

1047
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,720
lapsed yesterday. For those of you that didn't think I meant it when I said that a few weeks ago,

1048
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,040
I no longer have a subscription Ingress core or whatever, whatever the the thing is, it's gone.

1049
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:35,840
So but I am for because I recognize that I like to gamify my fitness. I do still play Pokemon Go

1050
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:42,640
and I play Pikmin Bloom. I haven't given any of those games a red cent since the incident

1051
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,280
happened where I reported a cheater and nothing was done about it. And I'm over it. I'm not I'm

1052
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:54,960
not supporting this system that is weekly and that does not have enforcement behind it. So anyway,

1053
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,080
and as far as this demo goes, I mean, I'm sure it's cute, but it's probably cute for five minutes.

1054
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:06,960
And I've already seen that Niantic has been pushing this technology for quite some time now

1055
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,760
between Peridot and some of these other things. It's time to show how you can actually make a fun

1056
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:19,120
game out of it. Because Peridot isn't it. So show us. I'm going to just be very blunt. Show us the

1057
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:26,480
fucking point. You know, like, like, I don't know, the not a Nintendo game, I would still love them

1058
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,760
to see see something like elements member elements. That was a fun game from Konami.

1059
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,920
Like, they should do something like that. Like, that'd be cool. Maybe I guess that's

1060
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,120
almost like Pikmin, you know, finding stuff hidden in your environment. But

1061
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:47,120
yeah, I don't know. Niantic is kind of out of ideas, I guess they like the license and make

1062
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,800
shells of like games. They have some gameplay to them. But you know, it's basically monetization

1063
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,080
machines. I and I've said this before, and I'm going to be very careful not to repeat myself. But

1064
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,800
the problem is, is that they are married to their mission statement more than they're married to

1065
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,840
their player base. That's a problem. The reason why that's happening is because the individual

1066
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,720
running the company is he is a smart guy. He's a brilliant mind. This is the guy behind Google

1067
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:17,680
Maps. He's done a lot of very smart things. You know what he hasn't done run a game company.

1068
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:24,240
And that's the other problem. So what are you? Are you a game company? Or are you a get out and

1069
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:30,960
explore the world company? Because it's starting to show that being both of those things is very,

1070
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:37,520
very difficult. So get the help you need, or admit that you're not a game company because you're not

1071
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:44,160
running it like one. Anyway, let's move on to our next story. Dark Sakura.

1072
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:52,480
So there's finally a specific home port of a game, but not quite how you think it's going to be.

1073
01:20:52,480 --> 01:21:00,400
So Daytona USA two is finally coming home, but it's because it's built in to like a dragon guy

1074
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:11,120
the man who erased his name. So I mean, the other game had some old Sega titles in it. So this one

1075
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:19,920
is Daytona USA two, but it's going to be under the non-licensed name Sega Racing Classic two.

1076
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:28,480
And then also in the game is going to be Fighting Vipers two and some Master System ports of Flicky

1077
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:36,720
and Galaxy Force. The game will be out on November 9th this year. But I mean,

1078
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:42,560
I would just like them to go. I just want more Sega ages and bring something like that back out.

1079
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:51,120
Like legit, the Yakuza Sega arcade stuff is really cool. Like I would love like a Sega arcade that

1080
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:55,680
has like all of what they've done throughout that series, like in one package. And I think

1081
01:21:55,680 --> 01:22:03,440
they could sell that and it would work. Yeah. It's so weird that like a modern AAA game nowadays can

1082
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:10,960
put, you know, older games that they publish into the game and not charge people extra for that

1083
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,640
Nintendo. Sega does what Nintendo don't. Oh, come back. Yep.

1084
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:27,200
I love it. So, so I think the real question and I bet Bobby would want to know the answer

1085
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,760
to this Dark Sakura. Could this with this getting the home port, everything is, is this how you

1086
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:41,760
might play Yakuza? Um, did I ever say I wasn't gonna play it? Oh, okay. Just I mean, I have,

1087
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:49,840
I have a I'm on a Mac. There's no way for me to play it. Oh, yeah. Because I, I feel like

1088
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,240
like a dragon was I could be wrong was on state but it's cloud gaming is probably the way to do

1089
01:22:54,240 --> 01:23:02,080
it. No, it came out after stadia shut down. And I mean, it might be on GeForce now. I mean,

1090
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:10,720
I don't know. But um, I never said I was never gonna play it. It's Halo I won't play.

1091
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:20,640
To screw Halo. All right, uh, next story Loki. So apparently the announcement is that

1092
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:28,880
Neetara is back and being up at being played by Megan Fox. So she's not only going to be doing

1093
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,800
the voice for the character, but also doing the mocap for it as well, which is pretty cool.

1094
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,160
And you know, she of course, in the reveal trailer said, you know, she comes from this weird realm.

1095
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:42,800
She's the type of vampire creature. She's evil, but she's also good. She's trying to save her

1096
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:49,200
people. I really like her. She's a vampire, which obviously resonates for whatever reason. Is it

1097
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:56,240
because you're a vampire Megan Fox? Are you a vampire? She also said that I'm not really

1098
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:04,160
voicing it. She's kind of me. So that's kind of funny. Because she's a vampire. She is a vampire

1099
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:12,640
confirmed Megan Fox vampire. Wow. Megan Fox is so goth you all she's so goth. No, I think it's

1100
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,840
cool. It's whatever. I like to watch the trailer for we're actually playing it on b roll right

1101
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,240
now. So yeah, I mean, no, I mean, I mean, but like, hear her voice. Yeah, no, I'm poking,

1102
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:27,280
I'm poking fun at it. But like, I do think it's cool. Like it is a good job. Yeah. No,

1103
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,760
and I like that, like, you know, Hollywood or like, you know, classic Hollywood or

1104
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,000
ever want to call it is crossing over more and more into games like this. Because,

1105
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,600
you know, we all remember a day when games were like you, you wouldn't see trip. Well,

1106
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,280
I don't know if Megan Fox is triple A, but she's probably at least a, you know, a list movie stars

1107
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,400
participating in things like this. And now it's it's kind of a grand theft auto or something. Yeah,

1108
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,600
it's very commonplace. So I think it's cool. Did you also see the what the other thing coming out

1109
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:04,880
from Mortal Kombat one is the other skin for Johnny Cage. Oh, it's Van Damme. Yeah, yeah.

1110
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:12,160
Which is. And I think that is him doing the voicing, I think. Yeah. He was supposed to

1111
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:17,440
originally have been the character that Johnny Cage became. Yeah. How full circle is that?

1112
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:21,920
I completely forgot that Jean-Claude Van Damme was doing that. That's awesome.

1113
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,480
Yeah. Yeah, that's really cool. There's there's honestly

1114
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:30,800
some pretty good talent involved in that game. Yeah, we finally got our street fighter cross

1115
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:37,600
Mortal Kombat now. This is not how we thought. But you know how fun. Oh, that means somebody

1116
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:44,240
could do that in Mugen. They could take guile versus Johnny Cage, both Jean-Claude Van Damme

1117
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,400
and we could finally see that back. You know, that's coming. Let's see a lot of comments and

1118
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,520
chat lighting up about this crystal skies and chat says, I mean, JK Simmons and Jason Isaacs

1119
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:59,120
in Baldur's Gate 3 is amazing. Yes. Keep in mind. JK Simmons in anything is awesome.

1120
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:05,840
Jason Isaacs was also in Midnight Sons, Marvel's Midnight Sons as Mafisto and he was perfect.

1121
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,280
Also something to keep in mind with the strike going on right now, video games are something

1122
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,920
that they that celebrities can work with. The screen actors can work, at least for now. Yes,

1123
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,480
I've heard about the whole voting in advance of, you know, to authorize a strike. I'm well aware

1124
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,480
of that situation, but we haven't heard of a strike being authorized on the games industry

1125
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:29,760
yet. So for now, you know, screen actors still work there. I wonder if we're not going to see

1126
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,800
more of these types of collaborations, you know, in a year, a year and a half's time because

1127
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,520
it allows some of the actors to work. Could be very interesting. See what that happens.

1128
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,440
Also, Questbuster in chat warns, in addition to the Mortal Kombat 1 story,

1129
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,840
the full story was already leaked and exists in clips out there. So watch out.

1130
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,480
Yeah, well, that that game is also out this coming week, I think very soon. Yeah,

1131
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:58,000
if you have the collector's editions on the 15th, otherwise you gotta wait until

1132
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,920
next Tuesday. It's still not very long. It's, uh, they're very good at announcing those games

1133
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:10,000
and then they're coming out like three months later. So yeah. All right. Well, let's talk about

1134
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,320
a game that's gonna, that did not get a similar announcement pattern because we don't know when

1135
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:20,640
this game is ever going to come out. Uh, but it is Elder Scrolls 6 and the news about exclusiveness

1136
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:29,280
is back in the news. Um, because it has to do with, um, uh, I think this is evidence that went

1137
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:35,840
in with Microsoft's battle with the FTC. There was some vagueness about if this game would be

1138
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:41,520
Xbox only because of course they don't want the courts to think, you know, there's going to be

1139
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:47,840
antitrust problems or whatever. So they say, um, with Elder Scrolls 6, it's so far out. It's hard

1140
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:53,120
to understand what the platforms will even be. We're talking about a game that's five plus years

1141
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,320
away. Remember that? Well, in an interview with Bloomberg this week, Phil Spencer was asked to

1142
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:03,760
get about Elder Scrolls 6 saying, we looked at it on a case by case basis with the games we build.

1143
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,400
We want to make sure our games are available in so many different places on our Xbox consoles,

1144
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,520
on PC, also via cloud. These games can come to almost any web enabled device.

1145
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,760
We're looking at millions and millions of players who will have access to star field and other Xbox

1146
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,640
game studios games. It's really about giving players choice around how they want to play

1147
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:30,560
and build their library games. I mean, like, look, he answered it in that quote right there.

1148
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,640
And this is the thing I understand this doesn't generate clicks for your website and all that

1149
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:40,960
stuff, but really look at what he's saying. And he can't, he can't say it so explicitly because

1150
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,680
there are still court things going on with Microsoft. Granted, Microsoft says Microsoft

1151
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:50,480
Bethesda was settled a long time ago, but they're still trying to project this image of, oh yeah,

1152
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,560
we were going to put our games everywhere. Activision, Blizzard come be a part of that.

1153
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,920
Yeah. You know, they want to project that image to all these regulatory bodies around the world.

1154
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:03,040
So he can't be explicit yet. If you read between the lines in that comment, he literally says

1155
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:11,040
between Xbox on the way between Xbox cloud, Xbox system and PC, we're going to get this

1156
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:16,800
game everywhere. We don't need PlayStation five. That's right. He's saying without saying.

1157
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:22,400
Yeah. And, and nor should the FTC be like suggesting that they need to put that game

1158
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:28,480
on a PlayStation console because like, I'm sorry, Sony, they're not publishing Spiderman on Xbox.

1159
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,720
Like why, why the double standards here? Like, I don't even understand why they would push that.

1160
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:38,240
And I'm sure that somebody in the FTP or FTC is just not clear enough to realize that like

1161
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:43,120
a Bethesda game is not an Activision game. And it's completely two different scenarios here, but

1162
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:49,680
yeah, it's, it's even, it's a stupid thing to even inquire about. Like, I don't understand.

1163
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:58,880
So elder scrolls six is exclusive to Microsoft. I guarantee it. That's like, I don't know why

1164
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:05,040
we're continuing to debate this. It's it's look at what they're saying. It's going to be exclusive

1165
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:10,240
a hundred percent, especially the way he compares it to starfield. Hello. Starfield just went

1166
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:16,320
through this exact same, uh, speculation and questions and talk arounds and all this stuff.

1167
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:21,840
And what happened? It's exclusive elder scroll six will be. And, and, and that's okay.

1168
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,560
Microsoft is buying these big companies so they can have exclusives to take on

1169
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:32,400
Sony's what Sony's got and refuses to put out on all of their devices. That's another

1170
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,360
interesting thing. Well, nevermind. We'll, we'll go to that another day. All right. Moving on.

1171
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:44,080
Let's, let's, let's go back to a, a more classic time in this next segment as we usually do.

1172
01:30:44,080 --> 01:31:00,400
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out

1173
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:06,560
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. All right. But

1174
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:13,040
dark soccer, you have a classic non game tonight, if I remember right. So what did you pick for us

1175
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:21,200
tonight? I picked connect for another game that has made enemies of entire families.

1176
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:29,760
So, um, it has gone by other names, uh, not just connect for, with the number four or spelled out

1177
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:37,680
four, but four up plot for fine for captain's mistress four in a row, drop four and gravitrix

1178
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,040
in the Soviet union. I'm only going to call it captain's mistress from now on.

1179
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:49,440
I'm kind of down for that. Um, but at any rate, um, you have two colors and your goal is to make

1180
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:58,960
four in a row, either, um, uh, you know, uh, right up, uh, vertically horizontal or diagonally. Um,

1181
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:09,520
and, uh, basically it's already what's referred to as a solved game, meaning that it's one that

1182
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:19,360
you can predict as long as people play perfectly. Um, now, um, the, uh, the thing about this one

1183
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:27,280
is that the official connect for trademark came out in February, 1974 by Milton Bradley. But

1184
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:34,080
the theories behind the game have already existed well before that. So I don't know if anyone

1185
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:39,840
remembers the pretty sneaky CIS commercial, cause they redid that commercial a couple of times in

1186
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:45,760
the history of that game. Um, but as it said in that commercial connect four of your checkers

1187
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,240
in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same, but look out, your opponent can sneak up

1188
01:32:50,240 --> 01:33:01,280
on you and win the game. Um, so it actually has a lot more to go with a little bit of a mathematical,

1189
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:10,800
uh, uh, theory behind it. Um, it's what's referred to also as a zero-sum game.

1190
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:21,440
Yeah, that, that's, that's the commercial. Um, meaning that, um, there are two sides,

1191
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:29,040
but one is strictly advantaged and one is strictly disadvantaged. So, um, but the first time the game

1192
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:36,960
was ever solved, like completely was, uh, by James Dow Allen on October 1st, 1988,

1193
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:46,000
and then independently by Victor Alice on October 16th, 1988. And it basically was by developing

1194
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:54,560
strategy to mathematically figure out where the, uh, the items should fall to get a perfect,

1195
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:04,880
a perfect game. Um, and, uh, they actually, they've even, um, had AI applied to it to figure

1196
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:13,520
out all the various, uh, different formulas that could be used to decide optimal gameplay. Um, but

1197
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,120
the biggest thing with the connect four is that honestly, the first one who does it first

1198
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:23,600
is the winner, you know, who makes, who makes it, uh, we used to play like, um,

1199
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:28,240
not the first person to get the four, but how many could you get out of the board,

1200
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,240
you know? So it was, it was pretty, pretty interesting.

1201
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:35,760
Oh, like how many four connections could you get once all the pieces were played?

1202
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,040
Exactly.

1203
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,120
Oh, that's an interesting little house rule. I like that.

1204
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:45,520
Yeah. So, um, there are other variations of the game that have different board sizes and

1205
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:53,040
game pieces and rules and stuff like that. Um, the variations, um, are really good for,

1206
01:34:53,040 --> 01:35:00,880
you know, again, folks who use, you know, AI for, uh, for, uh, projections and, um, game theorists.

1207
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:09,280
So the most common board is, uh, seven columns by six rows. Variations can be five by four,

1208
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:15,360
six by five, eight by seven, nine by seven, 10 by seven, eight by eight and infinite connect four,

1209
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,400
and then cylinder infinite connect four, which I haven't seen either of those.

1210
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:30,160
Um, so basically though, you're pretty much going, you know, just, just drop it in,

1211
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:36,960
see what happens. So, um, there are other, uh, variations, like I was saying, pop out,

1212
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:43,120
darts traditionally the same way, but, um, you, you know, you alternate your pieces,

1213
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,240
everyone takes their turn, but during each term, a player can either add another disc from the top,

1214
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:55,600
or if one has any discs of their own color on the bottom row, they can pop out that disc instead.

1215
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:00,960
And so it drops down everything from above it, you know, kind of like clearing out a Tetris line.

1216
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:09,920
Um, they also pop 10, which, um, you set up your discs into the slot filling up from only

1217
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:16,160
the bottom row and then moving on until the next row is filled. So you're, you're doing your four

1218
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:24,880
like that. There's also five in a row, of course, played on a six by nine grid. Um, power up, which

1219
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:32,320
is, um, like they have like a power checkers piece, um, where you can choose to play it once

1220
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:37,440
per game. And it has an anvil icon. If you play like one with an anvil icon, you have to pop out

1221
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:43,200
all the pieces below it. Um, you know, just different, different variations like that.

1222
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:49,760
So as far as, um, other versions of the game, there's a giant connect four, and we actually

1223
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:59,680
see someone who has constructed one. Um, there, yeah, this is the largest version. Um, it has made

1224
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:06,000
from weather resistant wood and measures 120 centimeters in both width and height. Um, it was

1225
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,880
released for the Microvision video game console in 1997, uh, developed by Robert Hofburg. And it was

1226
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:20,720
also released on the TI 99 for computer. I have played that one. Um, in 1979, of course I, I was

1227
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:27,680
a little bit older when I played it. Um, it also, I mean, one of the fun things about it is that

1228
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:32,640
you can just play a very quick game. There's travel versions of it. There's also another

1229
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:40,880
one they made in 2007 called connect for stackers, which instead of the grid, um, you have a board

1230
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:48,160
that you're placing your discs on. Um, there's also a physical game called connect four by four,

1231
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:55,040
where it has two layer vertical grid with colored discs for four players plus blocking discs.

1232
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:02,080
Um, in 2013, Baytech games released, uh, a connect for ticket redemption, arcade game

1233
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:07,840
under license by Hasbro, uh, 2015 winning moves published connect for twist and turn

1234
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,800
where you have a game tower instead of a grid. And it has five rings that twist independently.

1235
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:21,040
Sounds complicated. And then Baytech games in 2018 released a connect for arcade game called

1236
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:26,080
connect for hoops where you throw basketballs and then they show up as checkers on the screen.

1237
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:34,240
Um, so moving, uh, a little bit, a little bit past that, um, oh, actually I take that back.

1238
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:40,800
Um, there was connect for shots released by Hasbro in 2018, where you have to bounce the

1239
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:47,280
colored balls onto a grid until you achieve four in a row. So to go into some pop culture stuff,

1240
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:54,000
um, uh, Stuart Mcconey, while working with NME, uh, started a rumor that connect for was invented

1241
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:03,120
by David Bowie. Nope. On, uh, the hubs show Friday game night, there is a game, uh, called connect

1242
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:09,120
for basketball. So you use basketballs to play Nintendo did a version of this called four in a

1243
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:16,000
row, um, for their tabletop games compilation and clubhouse games, 51 worldwide classics for the

1244
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:24,560
switch. And then a game, uh, a way out, uh, you can play connect for as a mini game. And there you go.

1245
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:32,480
All right. Your classic non-video game of the month connect for great choice. Um,

1246
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:38,400
have you ever played? Oh, what's that? I was just going to say, can you guess anything that's next?

1247
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,720
Do you want to hazard a guess? I mean, I think I've shown you the list, but no, I don't think

1248
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:52,080
I've seen the list. So you have not know. So, um, yeah. Whatever could be happening, whatever could

1249
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:57,760
it be? We'll find out. We'll find out soon. Um, a couple of things, Jamie, I lost your avatar.

1250
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,960
I don't know if it's because I was running B roll or something, but I'm getting the squares

1251
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,440
on discord. I don't know what's going on. Sorry. Um, and, uh, what was the other thing I was going

1252
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:10,640
to say? Oh, have you, the last time I played connect for was actually, have you ever played

1253
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:16,320
the one they have at the bolt, which for those not, yeah. Yeah. For those not from this town is

1254
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:22,560
kind of the local, uh, uh, daddy bar, I guess, but it's pretty welcoming to all walks of life.

1255
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:29,120
Um, but it's, uh, they gotta, they have one of those giant connect fours. So, um, it always that

1256
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:33,360
and the Jenga always makes a big thud when the game's over. Cause they have one of those life

1257
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:38,640
sized Jenga's out there too. And, uh, they're always making gigantic noise when they fall apart.

1258
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:46,480
So yeah. Hmm. All right. I do not know what's going on with this thing. Cause I have it set to

1259
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:54,400
not put the stupid little camo thing on my window and it still does it. Um, during that segment,

1260
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,800
somebody in chat reminded me of a big headline that we didn't have on our list tonight. So I

1261
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,480
hope you won't mind me adding something here on the fly, but I think this is worth bringing up.

1262
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:09,120
And that is, uh, the announcement that read pop and the ESA have broken up. Uh, they will not be,

1263
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:13,840
yeah. Read pop and the ESA have broken up. They will not be working on E3 next year.

1264
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:19,840
And, uh, it has already been announced. The ESA has informed the LA convention center

1265
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:25,520
that there will not be an in-person show in 2024. That is because if you listen to what I said

1266
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:32,560
earlier this year, there will never be another E3. Uh, look, we talked a lot about this,

1267
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:38,560
but, um, E3 is, is long since dead and gone, but I am, I am actually legitimately surprised by this

1268
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:44,560
news because I thought for sure this was just, Oh, read pops just going to produce E3 as a fan

1269
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:50,000
convention like packs or have E3 at packs. But even that has apparently fallen apart

1270
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:57,040
for whatever reason. I wonder if the ESA is really hard-headed and that they really think

1271
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:06,400
they're going to get a show at the LA convention center again. Um, I am left to not be sure what

1272
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,200
else could be the possibility. Uh, the ESA has said in a statement, we appreciate read pops

1273
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,760
partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans

1274
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,720
together through their various events. While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry.

1275
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,120
Let's let the crickets chirp for that one. We are continuing to explore how we can evolve it

1276
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:32,160
to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event from format

1277
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:39,360
to location. We're good at getting into physical magazine publication. That's a winning strategy

1278
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:44,720
from format to location. So E3 is going to be moving from the LA convention center to

1279
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:49,840
the banquet room at Applebee's. Um, we are committed to our role as a, uh,

1280
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:55,120
kind of vendor, Kevin, or for the industry convener airport Hilton, and, uh, look forward

1281
01:42:55,120 --> 01:43:05,040
to sharing news about E3 in the coming months. Hmm. Very interesting. Um, I was just curious

1282
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:09,120
about something when bringing this whole thing up. So let me actually, I just wanted to check out,

1283
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:15,120
uh, yeah, I'm doing this live. I have no idea what to expect here. Um, so I'm actually looking

1284
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:21,280
at the ESAs website right now, because I'm just kind of curious, like, what are some things that

1285
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:29,120
the ESA has done for the industry? Okay, here we go in the news back on August 23rd, essential facts,

1286
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:34,960
key findings. Okay. So they did a study, I guess that's something neat. And then we go back over

1287
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:40,480
a month before that for their last big headline, July 20th gaming for everyone creating an

1288
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:44,720
inclusive environment for a global player community. Well, yes, I agree with that games

1289
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:50,720
are for everyone, but how did the ESA do that? Let's see. They gathered with experts, innovators

1290
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:56,160
and change makers in New York's games for change festival. So the ESA didn't put it on. They went

1291
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:03,680
somewhere else. They showed up. Showing up is really like the most important step, right?

1292
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:12,160
The ESA is dead. They just don't know it yet. Don't tell them. All right, moving on. Let's

1293
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:18,160
talk about some other news, uh, that happened this week rapidly in our industry with rapid fire news.

1294
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:22,880
We'll, we'll give you some more headlines faster than the ESA will. Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.

1295
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:30,880
Yes. So I am very excited about this. Uh, it is another thing that you can get to build a console.

1296
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:37,520
So this is not necessarily coming from Lego this time, but it's mega blocks or I think it,

1297
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,560
I don't know if it's mega blocks or mega constructs because they used to have the

1298
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,680
constructs license as well, but mega block, I guess maybe they went back to that. Um,

1299
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:55,440
they have a three to four or three fourth scale replica of the Xbox 360 and it is $150. It's 1400

1300
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:03,920
pieces and it includes the Xbox 360 console, the controller and a replica of halo three,

1301
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,640
the case and everything. Um, the thing that bothers me the most about this is the internals.

1302
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:14,320
They do show that there's like actual, um, circuit boards and stuff on the inside and it does not

1303
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:23,360
look like an Xbox 360. I have taken part so many of those. It's just, they kind of close ish.

1304
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:29,440
It's, it's, you know, it's, it's, you tried it too. You tried, like they, they, they put

1305
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:33,760
some things in there and they're like, yeah, I think it's like a Borgos or like, you know,

1306
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:41,920
heatsink goes here. Some, some resistors go here close enough. Um, but I mean, it still looks cool.

1307
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,000
Um, I don't know what everyone hates on mega blocks. I mean, they've got some pretty good

1308
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,680
Pokemon, um, builds. I've done their like giant Pikachu thing that they did and that was pretty

1309
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:59,440
sweet. Um, but yeah, it'll be out in October on the eighth and they had pre-orders for it.

1310
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:06,080
It's exclusively at target and it's sold out already, but I'm in target all the time. So I

1311
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:10,960
will just have to keep an eye out. Also, I have no room for this whatsoever, but.

1312
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,280
We can just add that to the queue of unbuilt crap in our house.

1313
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:22,640
Um, what is not included though with it is the ginormous immense brick of a power supply

1314
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,480
that is not included with the kit. And fortunately that would have bumped up the

1315
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:29,840
purchase price of $250 and they just weren't willing to do that.

1316
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,480
Or a red filter. So you can create your red ring of death.

1317
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:39,440
I do. Oh yes, that too. Um, yeah, it does light up. Um, I do like how the box though is the same

1318
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:44,960
box as the Xbox three 60, which is pretty, pretty cool. So I do like that about it. Um,

1319
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:48,960
is the original model or one of the slims is the original model, the original model.

1320
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:54,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I'm, I'm pretty, you know, I did check it out. Um,

1321
01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:00,720
I don't, yeah, I it's a little pricey, but you know, it's, it's not too bad for 1400 pieces.

1322
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:09,120
All right. What else? And then, uh, we've got more stuff coming to Nintendo switch online.

1323
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:15,360
So this week we got a few, um, Game Boy, Nintendo, and super Nintendo games. Um,

1324
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:23,520
starting with a quest for Camelot for the super Nintendo, uh, we have, uh, Kirby star stacker

1325
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:33,600
and on the, um, for the NES and then also, uh, downtown and Nakatsu March super awesome

1326
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:40,080
field day and joy mech fight. It's a CUNYO game. Yep. It is a CUNYO game.

1327
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:46,720
And those are as well for the, uh, Nintendo or yeah, for the NES.

1328
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:57,360
All right. Uh, what do you have? So I have, um, for fans of cold to the lamb, like myself,

1329
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:05,840
uh, there is our custom controllers released that are available now, um, through a, uh,

1330
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:13,840
a website, uh, for captain Alex CPT and Alex all inward, who's selling, uh, dual sense Xbox

1331
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:20,240
controllers, joy con and pro controllers. And if you get one, you will also get like with,

1332
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:27,440
with the special package, it's like 165 bucks for one. Um, but you can get a licensed custom

1333
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:32,640
controller, premium packaging, a two inch hard enamel spinner pin that I kind of just

1334
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:40,480
want the pin and a stainless steel authenticity card that is signed by captain Alex. And you can

1335
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:46,320
just go to captain Alex.com to see what they are. I just want the pin. That's all.

1336
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:52,960
All right. Well, uh, you heard about it in the intro and this is just so silly. We have to talk

1337
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,840
about it, but you know what? Uh, who, who doesn't love video games more than cup noodle and, uh,

1338
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,840
all of their various collaborations they do. I love all their collaborations. They can,

1339
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:09,200
there's no collaboration that has been amazing. Well, they know that gamers apparently love cup

1340
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,240
noodle, by the way, we are not being paid for this product placement. And I feel like we ought

1341
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:17,760
to be, but it was reported on CNN. It's in the news. We should bring it up. The gaming cup noodle

1342
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,320
is coming out in Japan. So it's not coming out here. Uh, but, uh, maybe Akuma JP is still out

1343
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:27,760
there. It can get us some, uh, it is coming out on September 18th in Japan gaming cup noodle.

1344
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:33,200
This is. It's also a rainbow colored package that looks really cute. I got to say it's why,

1345
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:40,480
what makes it gaming cup noodle it's caffeinated, caffeinated ramen, but it's going to be available

1346
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:46,880
in garlic, garlic, and black pepper yakisoba varieties, which both sound pretty good. Honestly,

1347
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:53,200
uh, both versions are soup free. So, um, you don't have to worry about the soup spilling out and

1348
01:49:53,200 --> 01:50:02,080
over. I was, I was worried that there'd be soup in my soup. That's right. So, um, it's, you know,

1349
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:08,560
again, obviously when this showed up in fall of SC 15, it was a huge hilarity.

1350
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,920
They're just like, okay, let's, let's just take, we're going to take the soup.

1351
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,320
Let's remove the soup, put caffeine in there instead.

1352
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:19,360
Now it's gamers soup, but it's not soup. It doesn't make any sense,

1353
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:24,320
but I love it because it's totally cup. It makes any sense. It's the most random

1354
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:30,160
fucking thing in the world that I'm here for it. So, all right, let's check. This is the

1355
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:40,560
type of leadership that we need for the ESA cup noodle needs to run the E3 show. It would be

1356
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:45,040
insane. Like I would just love it. We are at the point where cup noodle is a better run company

1357
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:52,800
than the ESA. Yes. A hundred percent co-signed. Oh my God. All right. Uh, let's travel around

1358
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:57,040
the world and check out some release dates and some things you can pick up with your, uh, cup

1359

1360
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:08,080
we're not really in fourth quarter yet, but maybe it's basically fourth quarter at this point.

1361
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:15,360
Uh, so we have Axiom Verge two on the Xbox one rain, uh, rain world on PlayStation five,

with the Castlevania DLC that is out in Japan this week in a regular and collector's edition.

1383
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:36,080
Uh, I know we joke about a lot of collector edition stuff coming out of Japan, but the,

1400
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:19,440
and literally the baby shark music started playing over the loudspeaker and I'm like the fuck

1401
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:27,520
anyway. So, uh, on, uh, switch, we have, uh, button KITOS one into HD remaster, uh, for,

01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:41,360

1404
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:46,640
the listener round table. I don't know if we have emails tonight. I forgot to look, find out. Nope.

1405
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:50,880
All right. But maybe we'll get a call or two and, uh, some questions from chat as well. And

1406
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:56,080
just a little bit, we still have some stories starting with Loki. Yep. So we talked a little

1407
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:01,680
bit about this, I think a few weeks ago about X-Box new reporting system that they're going to

1408
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:07,840
have. Uh, now they have actually launched it. Um, initially in the U S UK, Canada, Ireland,

1409
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:14,480
Australia, and New Zealand, it's going to be for reporting abusive voice chats and it allows you to

1410
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:20,160
the system is going to capture 60 second clips and save it to your console. And you have 24

1411
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:26,160
hours to complete your report. And then you can send off the offending clips to Microsoft's and

1412
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:31,360
ban somebody, or at least give them seven warnings. I think they had originally,

1413
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:38,080
seven strike plan. Yeah. That's some game of baseball there. Um, our feature is designed

1414
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:43,760
so that only, only you, the player can initiate the capture of the last 60 seconds of gameplay.

1415
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:50,720
Activity occurred for the content moderation purposes that says it works. Um, let's see,

1416
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:55,520
they will not appear in your recent captures and the clips cannot be downloaded and modified

1417
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:06,160
or shared. Um, okay, cool. I mean, well, I mean, if it's abusive content, then you shouldn't share

1418
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:11,760
it. Right. Right. I would assume, you know, um, so I guess you got to really be on the ball though,

1419
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:16,960
if it's, you know, only 60 seconds previously. So it makes, it doesn't make sense.

1420
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:21,120
I do feel like there's been a lot more companies that have been taking this sort of abuse that

1421
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:24,960
happens on platforms a little more seriously. Like I've been seeing just, you know, cause I've

1422
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:30,160
been playing a little more Overwatch lately and I, uh, have seen people that are using the reporting

1423
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:34,720
features in there and you actually get the actual reports that say something happened, which is nice.

1424
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:38,800
I wish other games I've played in the past would do something like that. Um, that, that let them

1425
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,360
know that their reports didn't go to waste. So, um, it's just interesting to see, you know,

1426
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:47,360
especially considering, you know, that, that example is jumping out at me and I'm thinking

1427
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:51,200
about who Microsoft is trying to buy right now, that they are trying to clean up, you know,

1428
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:58,480
a lot of the stuff shenanigans that happen on Xbox live. So yeah. Um, let's just, let's just

1429
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:03,920
hope it leads to cleaning up some of these things that we assume to be true about Xbox live, uh,

1430
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:10,400
and a place where everyone feels welcome, which is very important. So, uh, dark soccer.

1431
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:18,480
Um, for the game sea of stars, their developer sabotage is working on some DLC.

1432
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:26,000
So of course this is a retro RPG. It's a pretty well liked from what I understand. Um,

1433
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:34,880
but on Canada radio, their CEO theory Bollinger, I guess, uh, was, uh, basically, uh, saying that

1434
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,760
there's going to be some, some new stuff. And there was also a blog post at the time that said

1435
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:46,080
a fully fledged site adventure DLC would be called throws of the watchmaker and would expand even

1436
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:53,120
more on the world of sea of stars. And there you go. I definitely like that's one of those games

1437
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:56,080
that just came out in this last week where it's like, Oh my God, I got to get around to that too.

1438
01:58:56,080 --> 01:59:01,200
Yeah. I've heard a lot of good things about it. Just, you know, the, that it really feels like

1439
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:05,840
some type of spiritual successor to chrono trigger. Um, and I don't know why there's

1440
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:10,880
this rumor out there that I hate chrono trigger. I don't, um, I I'm very excited to check out this

1441
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,840
game and, and, uh, uh, check it out. It looks really cool. I've, I've saw a little bit of

1442
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:21,680
streaming of it, but not at times. I didn't want to spoil it for myself. So. All right.

1443
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:30,320
Loki. Uh, yes. So that wonderful game stray about the cat wandering through a cyberpunk

1444
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:37,520
dystopia is, um, apparently going to be getting a movie, an animated movie. Um,

1445
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:44,720
and they said, you know, it's, um, they called the game the greatest hope punk movie that's

1446
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:50,320
ever been made. Um, I'm excited about it. I'm gonna think of you a good property to make an

1447
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:57,120
animated movie for. So we'll see what ends up happening with that when it's coming. Um,

1448
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:08,400
neat. Yeah. Um, I, uh, obviously we are seeing a lot of games get adapted into movies and TV

1449
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:13,760
and all that sort. So I can't say it's too surprising, but it's kind of cool. Cause that's

1450
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:19,120
stray. I don't want to say it came out of nowhere, but like, I, you know, they announced it and

1451
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:23,280
everybody was like, Ooh, the cat game. And everybody then kind of like jumped on board

1452
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:28,640
with it. And it did, it did very well as a result. So, um, because it delivered on being the cat

1453
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:33,040
game. Uh, and I think people really had fun with it. So it's kind of, and I didn't realize that,

1454
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:38,880
uh, Anna Purna is actually, they have an animation studio and a Purna animation that they made a

1455
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:45,520
Nomura or Nimona on Netflix. So they've already done an animated movie. So now they get to use

1456
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:51,200
their own property for that. Yeah. Uh, Tiger con chat says the title might cause confusion

1457
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:56,720
because there was a movie called strays, a dog movie that's rated R and we get movies that come

1458
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:00,800
out with the same title. Sometimes like, you know, after a few years go by and I don't think this is

1459
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:04,640
something that's going to be coming out this year. It's going to be a few years off. Put the cute cat

1460
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:14,480
on the poster or the, the little, um, box art. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and crystal skies points out,

1461
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:22,000
they finished Nimona. Uh, they didn't fully make it. Oh, got it. Okay. Okay. All right. Um,

1462
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:28,160
I think we got one more here and, uh, this is a little bit surprising. Uh, this kind of came out

1463
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:34,320
of nowhere, but I'm, I'm having a flappy bird kind of moment hearing about this and it's not exactly,

1464
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:39,920
but yeah. Okay. Well, let's talk about it. So it is the viral game only up, which you may have seen

1465
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:44,240
played on Twitch. Cause a lot of people have been playing it on Twitch. Uh, it's no longer available

1466
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:50,080
on steam. It was delisted from steam. Uh, this game has had a lot of interesting chat around it

1467
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:55,520
because there's been talk about infringing assets. Cause somebody there's that the fact that the game

1468
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:01,200
promoted NFTs, which we all know of pretty much flopped in the industry at this point, uh, gamers

1469
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:06,400
won on that one. We pushed back against that boy. Oh boy. I think finally enough companies heard us

1470
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:11,600
that NFTs, you don't hear anybody talking about it in games anymore. Well, except in like very

1471
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:17,280
obscure places where they belong. Um, but now the creator of the game says they need to put the

1472
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:22,800
game behind them due to stress. What I need now is peace of mind and healing says the developer

1473
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:29,920
S C K R games. There was an update on the steam page, uh, about the decision saying I'm a solo

1474
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:34,960
developer and this game is my first experience in game dev, a game I did for creativity to test

1475
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:39,680
myself and where I made a lot of mistakes. The game has kept me under a lot of stress all these

1476
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:44,160
months. Now I want to put the game behind me and yes, the game won't be available in the steam

1477
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:49,520
store soon. That's what I decided myself. And sure enough, it is no longer available.

1478
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:57,200
Don't make an NFT game. Well, I don't necessarily think the NFT part was that big. It was,

1479
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:59,840
they weren't like, it wasn't, that wasn't front and center. I want to say like,

1480
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:04,720
it's not in the game. I want to say maybe the developer at one point like talked about it

1481
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,400
possibly. Like it's one of those things that I think the headline got bigger than it actually

1482
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:14,000
was like weren't in the game. Yeah. I don't know if it was a lot of the infringing assets.

1483
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:20,960
I know that was some contention before legit. Yeah. Because yeah, I'm wondering if it's more

1484
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:28,480
of like legal, um, you know, pressure, you know, to like, okay, let's put this, let's, let's,

1485
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:33,040
let's take this away. So no one else can find more assets or infringe type of thing because

1486
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:38,240
I'm just a solo dev. And if I get sued, I'm gonna be in trouble. Cause I don't have a lot

1487
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:43,920
of money. Uh, so Bobby points out that there was NFT iconography in the game. So maybe there were,

1488
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:50,800
the dev was probably a fan of this and, uh, probably inserted some of that into the game,

1489
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:59,360
but did the game itself use NFTs? It does not appear so. So, um, but all that aside,

1490
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:04,720
it was very popular on Twitch and it's not often you hear about popular games where the developer

1491
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:09,760
just says, I'm out and just up and leaves. And that's, that's kind of why I pulled in the

1492
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:13,520
reference to flappy bird, which I know is a bit of a different circumstance, but that's another

1493
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,480
one where I think right at the height of that game's fame, the guy said, I, I don't want to

1494
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:27,120
do this anymore. Bye. And that was, that was it. And by golly, he stuck to his word. Right. So I,

1495
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:32,640
it's interesting to see this happen. Um, that's, you know, basically leaving that money on the

1496
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:37,360
table, but at the same time, I get it. It's a lot of stress when you're this one person,

1497
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:42,640
your game is under a microscope and people are talking about NFT references or, you know,

1498
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:46,240
the, the status of where certain assets came from and so forth.

1499
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:50,400
Or just updating your game. Like you just don't want to do it anymore. Like I don't want to

1500
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:56,160
support this game anymore. So like, I can't sit here and say, I blame him, but it's like,

1501
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:59,440
you know, you got to put your mental health above everything else, period. I'm always going to

1502
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:06,000
support that, but it is just still so you don't often see people walk away from this level of a

1503
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,360
game with the exposure that it had for that. And that's just kind of what makes this like

1504
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:17,440
surprising. But I, I don't wish the developer any ill will for sure. I hope he finds the piece he's

1505
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:23,200
looking for, um, with this decision. Cause that is, that is a lot of money to leave behind. Um,

1506
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:31,120
so good luck to him. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's go to our round table where we will solicit any

1507
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:36,320
other questions y'all might have for us in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network

1508
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:41,440
against which TV vog network. Um, you could also, if you want to head on over to our discord,

1509
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:45,520
you can hop in the green room and we'll take some calls. Um, I believe dark Sakura already

1510
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:50,080
mentioned we have no emails tonight, but if you'd like to send us an email for a future week,

1511
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:56,720
participate at orange laundry.com is a great place to do it. Um, I will admit I did not check

1512
02:05:56,720 --> 02:06:01,440
our Twitter this week to see if we got anything, but I will take a look at that real quick,

1513
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:08,000
just because I've been on that website less and less, but, um, I will still take a look.

1514
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,200
I see dark soccer's plug for the show. Oh, I guess I could, I did tag OLR in this,

1515
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:18,480
but since it's somewhat related, um, uh, talking a little bit about star field real quick.

1516
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:22,560
One of the things I did like in star field was that they have some really cute little Easter

1517
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:28,160
eggs and some of the art it's very tangential to, um, fall out. And some of the interesting

1518
02:06:28,160 --> 02:06:32,800
things you see there, but like I was rating a random moon base and I saw this poster

1519
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,880
rely on each other and it looked like all the people holding hands, like, you know,

1520
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:41,280
at the end of up, um, spoiler alert, that's big vibes. I got, I also, this was my favorite,

1521
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:47,440
a vending machine that says we are so sorry for any inconvenience. We are currently out of ice,

1522
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:52,080
but the gag is it's so old the, and it's abandoned on the moon. It's been iced over,

1523
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:57,440
but I just, I don't know. I, I love those cute little like Easter eggs that are in the

1524
02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:00,480
environment. Dark soccer. I feel like this is something you can appreciate too. When you used

1525
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:05,120
to do things like the mass effecting blog where, you know, you would go around and find all these

1526
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:09,920
things in the environment, like store names on the Citadel and things like that. Yeah. Yeah.

1527
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:14,400
This one's intimate lingerie. Like that stuff like that is really funny to me.

1528
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:17,040
I have a last minute story. If you'd want to. Oh, sure. Let's do it.

1529
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:26,960
So this comes from, um, a, I don't know. It's, I guess it's from a website, the boy from Mexico.

1530
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:33,360
It's this guy, uh, talking Edward Dennis, uh, who's talking about his book, but in the, about

1531
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:40,800
this Edward Dennis guy, it says artist, author, animator, game designer. And one of the blurbs

1532
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:49,040
in here says, um, uh, in addition to this, Edward is working with paramount pictures on a video

1533
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:56,800
adaptation of their twin peaks property. Now, obviously not a video adaptation. I think the

1534
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:04,720
referencing video game is just mistyped in here, but could there be a twin peaks game coming

1535
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:11,840
from paramount? Could that have just been placeholder text or something? I don't know.

1536
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:18,160
I'm a little, this, this is a reach to me. Um, I mean, I would love to see some type of official

1537
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:23,600
twin peaks game. Here's the thing. I don't see it as something David Lynch would get into.

1538
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:29,600
That's, that's where my, that's the real block from my mind. Like, I, I don't want to,

1539
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:34,320
you know, just because this is just a random thing, I'm a person I've never heard of. I don't

1540
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:38,880
want to necessarily dismiss it on that alone, but just the concept. I feel like David Lynch

1541
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:44,960
would hate it. So I, unless somebody has talked him into it, which great. I don't see this as

1542
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:51,600
something David Lynch would ever embrace. I just don't. And I mean, granted, I feel like he has

1543
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:56,560
ultimate control over the IP because that's why it took so long for there to be a reboot. I suppose

1544
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:02,160
if paramount own that or Showtime or whatever, now, maybe they could go around them. But I,

1545
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:10,480
I just know if he's not involved, it's going to suck. And that's just the fact. So yeah.

1546
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:15,120
Yeah. Bobby Blackwell says that might be, I had a phone call with them once and that's,

1547
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:19,760
that's a little bit, that's kind of the vibes I get from that. You know, again, if,

1548
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:25,520
if somebody has convinced David Lynch to make a video game, then fuck yeah, I'm here for it.

1549
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:30,320
And honestly, it might be a great way to continue the story of twin peaks because the reality is

1550
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:36,160
a lot of key actors and actresses in twin peaks are dying. They're passing away. The log lady is

1551
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:43,760
no longer with us. Um, the, one of the prominent, um, FBI folks is no longer with us. David Bowie

1552
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:50,720
passed away. They kind of found a way around that in the, the, the return, but like video games would

1553
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:57,680
be a way for the universe of twin peaks to, to live on without having to rely on, you know,

1554
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:03,680
if certain people are going to be physically able or present to do a twin peaks continuation.

1555
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:09,840
So like if somebody has been able to convince David Lynch of that, then fucking awesome. But

1556
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:15,520
I just, as a big fan of twin peaks, my big reaction is, Oh, David Lynch would never go

1557
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:20,480
for that. Forget it. Like he'll have to die and it'll be his estate. And that's going to be many

1558
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:27,280
years. So, um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Babylon five continued last month with an

1559
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:32,080
animated movie and that's how they cast new voices for the actors who passed. Yeah. It's very,

1560
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:36,880
very similar to that concept. So. Wouldn't be too unlike what happened with, uh,

1561
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:45,520
the doctor who, uh, second doctor episodes. Yeah. Yeah. They had to remake them in animation,

1562
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:51,920
but yeah. Uh, Shane in chat says I need more twin peaks media. Anyway, I can get it. I'll take a

1563
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:58,560
game. That PSX demo looked very good. It did look good, but it didn't really look, I don't,

1564
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:03,200
I don't know how fun of a game it is. I feel like the entire, and I don't want to disrespect the

1565
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:08,560
folks that worked hard on that because again, as a fan, I think that's a really great fan project,

1566
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:13,040
but I think that's all it's going to be is a, Oh, that's neat. Oh, look what they did there. Oh,

1567
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:19,840
that's a cool reference. Oh, I love that. It's not going to really build on the universe. If

1568
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:26,960
we're talking a legit twin peaks video game, I'm expecting that it is continuing the universe and

1569
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:32,400
the, you know, essentially mythology at this point behind twin peaks and continuing those stories.

1570
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:39,200
I would love to have the ending of the return explained. This is the wild thing about twin

1571
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:45,760
peaks, the return. If you watch all, but the, the next to last episode, you're like, wow,

1572
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:51,840
they really brought this full circle. This is incredible. They, I mean, they do it kind of fast,

1573
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:57,280
but like the way they tie it back to the very beginning is like, Holy shit, this is incredible.

1574
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:02,000
It's like, he really did know this was it the whole time. And like, it took us, you know,

1575
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,040
25 years to get here, but here we are, it was mind blowing. And then you get one more episode,

1576
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:16,320
the very last episode. And you're like, the fuck was that? What now? What happened? What?

1577
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:23,440
And like the way it ends, you know, very much like the original Twin Peaks series itself. How's Annie?

1578
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:30,400
Like the way this ends is just like, that is too much of a cliffhanger. And yeah,

1579
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:35,200
Shane said, that's why I need more. Yeah, same. I would love nothing more than another

1580
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:40,000
Twin Peaks season four. But the more and more time that passes, the less and less

1581
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:47,520
likely it is that it's going to happen unless they, they really do change the year and have

1582
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,720
a completely different cast in there or something. I don't know. I don't know how they do it.

1583
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:57,520
So we'll see. Anyway. Any other last minute stories, Loki?

1584
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:00,160
Nope.

1585
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:04,240
All right. Well, with that, then I think we're towards the end of another episode and we will

1586
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:10,000
start to wrap things up. We'll say goodbye first to Dark Sacras. I believe you're going

1587
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,800
to do your thing. But do you have any final thoughts or party words for us tonight?

1588
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,720
I have a request.

1589
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,520
Yeah.

1590
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:25,920
If anyone is in a thrift store and they see one of the Echo Kitchama jigs, they're like

1591
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:31,040
these slotted spoon things. Buy it for me, please. I will pay for shipping. I've been looking for one.

1592
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:34,160
Interesting. Is that a slotted spoon?

1593
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:39,760
They're super convenient. It's like a kind of a slotted spoon spatula sort of thing. And it's

1594
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:43,600
like this Holy grail of kitchen equipment. Cause you can fry with it and do all this stuff. And

1595
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:46,160
I super want one. Cause we used to have one when I was a kid.

1596
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:47,760
Interesting.

1597
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,920
They're like a very neat spoon. If anyone wants to know what it is, just look it up.

1598
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,840
All right. We'll have fun with your Dead by Daylighting tonight. We'll see you in a little

1599
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,160
bit.

1600
02:13:56,160 --> 02:14:00,880
Okay. I know that was a random one, but that's the truth. All right. I'll see y'all later.

1601
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:07,120
All right. Take care. Bye-bye. All right. And Loki lap last but not least your final thought.

1602
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:10,400
Oh, wait, no, wait. Sorry. Before we get to your final thought, let me say,

1603
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,360
thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and downloading our show,

1604
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:16,480
whether you were here live or you were listening to us in the podcast feed.

1605
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:20,880
Thank you for being here. Tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because

1606
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:24,640
we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1607
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:28,640
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show like Spotify,

1608
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:32,720
whatever. That goes an awful long way as well. We really appreciate all of that.

1609
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:37,440
Also, we would really appreciate a follow for VOG Network over not just on Twitch,

1610
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:43,440
but on YouTube as well, as well as our social medias, both Blue Sky and Twitter.

1611
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:47,600
Loki, now I'll go to your final thought.

1612
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:56,480
My final thought is tomorrow at noon, New Pacific and 3 p.m. Eastern will be when I debut my

1613
02:14:56,480 --> 02:15:01,920
finale for season two. So look for that. Be on the YouTube feed. It has a premiere

1614
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:09,200
probably later tonight and it will be up on social media later tonight as well.

1615
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:15,760
If I remember and I don't have a meeting that bleeds into noon, which sometimes happens,

1616
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:20,880
I will I will lurk in the channel. That's fine. Or just watch it whenever.

1617
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,840
Yeah, absolutely. I'll get you get to those views. All right. Awesome.

1618
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:30,160
Let's see my final thought tonight. Thanks again to Dragon Con for a great time.

1619
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:36,160
Looking forward to TwitchCon in a few weeks. And I guess I'm starting Baldur's Gate 3 tonight.

1620
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:40,720
So I'm going to be doing some playing on my own channel tomorrow with Baldur's Gate 3 after work.

1621
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:47,120
So check that out. That adventure is beginning very soon. Rob Roberts here on Twitch. So that's

1622
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:52,640
going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you all so much for watching

1623
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:57,280
the show tonight. Appreciate it. Have a good one, everybody. And we'll see you next time. Bye.

1624
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:26,080
Radio, nor fog network, but you know, they were all.
