1
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:14,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup Noodle announces the greatest innovation in noodles since the instant noodle itself.

2
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:15,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaming Cup Noodle.

3
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:16,425
[SPEAKER_01]: It's caffeinated.

4
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:18,926
[SPEAKER_01]: On the grind, you need a quick fix while you quickly unwind?

5
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:20,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaming Cup Noodle.

6
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,207
[SPEAKER_01]: It's caffeinated.

7
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:23,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Need a pick you up that won't thick you up?

8
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:24,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaming Cup Noodle.

9
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,329
[SPEAKER_01]: It's caffeinated.

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Real talk would slurp eerily.

11
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:29,351
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the RGB packaged intro.

12
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:34,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this and the rest of the two weeks in gaming news.

00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:12,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

17
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:12,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

18
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

19
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:14,052
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

20
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:14,612
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you?

21
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,292
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your week off?

22
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what week off?

23
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.

24
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did a 13 hour stream.

25
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:22,725
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

26
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:23,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

27
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:26,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were, you were working, but different type of work.

28
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:27,989
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't advertise enough.

29
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So like only a few people were there, but I appreciate the people who were, and I made a bunch of friends during my subathon.

30
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:43,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's just the, like the, the last few series of weeks have just been, um, uh, compostable.

31
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:59,610
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably was a tricky week weekend to do a subathon to with all the the just stuff that goes on for Labor Day, you know, between your Dragon Con where I was at Penny Arcade Expo, I know here locally SacAnime, like it's just it's a big convention weekend, and the other types of holiday junk that people do.

32
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:04,128
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that had anything to do with what was going on with my week though.

33
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:05,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying the Summathon attendance.

34
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:06,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

35
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, but but I honestly, I didn't advertise it enough.

36
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:11,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what it was.

37
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:19,379
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, given that I have people from all over the world, you know, who don't necessarily celebrate the same holiday or have to deal with our conventions.

38
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,501
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was it was just all my fault.

39
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you got to play video games all day, though.

40
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:25,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that was still fun.

41
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:29,225
[SPEAKER_00]: All day solo queue.

42
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:29,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

43
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:30,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for a little bit.

44
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:33,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I played with a few people.

45
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:33,806
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

46
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:37,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also joining us tonight, even though he's not on video yet, he is with us.

47
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:39,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

48
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy early birthday.

49
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been here the whole time.

50
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,348
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

51
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:44,528
[SPEAKER_03]: You said what's going on?

52
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,529
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not on video right now, but you will be later.

53
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,269
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like rendering a video or something.

54
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I am rendering a video that I've been working editing for literally a month.

55
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen your posts about this.

57
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been working very hard on this.

58
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:01,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's been a whole month that I've been editing this video.

59
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it is.

60
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:04,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It is done.

61
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:07,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's so done.

62
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as DarkSakura beat me to it.

63
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:11,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy early birthday.

64
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:11,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

65
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know your birthday is tomorrow.

66
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

67
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a day that a lot of people remember your birthday.

68
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And I... We both have a disaster birthday, you know.

69
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:23,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine was the Waco thing.

70
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas my birthday is the day that sodomy laws got overturned and is also the gay marriage legalization day.

71
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:34,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a bit of a celebration day, I guess.

72
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:37,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I will say I also share a birthday with Tim Curry.

73
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:37,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.

74
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:39,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that is that is pretty good.

75
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:44,021
[SPEAKER_03]: My my big birthday share is Ariana Grande.

76
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,842
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's your big birthday share, Loki?

77
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should talk about the big event he shares his birthday with.

78
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,074
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

79
00:03:56,074 --> 00:04:00,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, OK, well, I'm going to try not to, like, put this in Debbie Downer mode here.

80
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:05,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, like so it was a bit of ironic trivia.

81
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:10,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw the other day, like on on Facebook, it was reminded to me that

82
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:15,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Irwin passed on September 4th, which happens to be the day that my mom passed as well.

83
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:16,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, that's interesting.

84
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:18,594
[SPEAKER_02]: They passed on the same day.

85
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:22,116
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that's not positive at all.

86
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:22,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Moby?

87
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:23,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's cool.

88
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:24,738
[SPEAKER_00]: And Keanu Reeves.

89
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's doubly cool.

90
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,020
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your answer.

91
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,520
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that.

93
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:32,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently Ludacris and John Ritter.

94
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

95
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:37,547
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one heck of an action movie right there.

96
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:38,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

97
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:39,388
[SPEAKER_00]: And Harry Connick Jr.

98
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:41,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

99
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:45,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's some folks.

100
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:49,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Loki, I'm glad you're getting you're getting a YouTube finish for your birthday.

101
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:50,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really exciting.

102
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:51,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

103
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be premiering it tomorrow.

104
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:57,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my season two finale of Channel 64.

105
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:04,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the season three technically started like two or three weeks ago, but it took a while.

106
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:08,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It is essentially like a mini movie.

107
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:12,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It is almost 35 minutes long with credits.

108
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:26,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it is the culmination of all of the lore and SMPs that I've been on since the beginning of making Minecraft content.

109
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:29,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is.

110
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:39,776
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of like deeply emotional things that are going on with it, I guess, like, I don't know, like it sounds really like like depressing, but like it's it's

111
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:50,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, there's a lot of themes that go along with it, and especially if you've watched my older content, then you would catch a lot of the stuff that's in this one.

112
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:53,831
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of, like, kind of ties back to everything.

113
00:05:53,831 --> 00:06:06,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not only celebrating the lore that I've created in, like, my stuff, but the lore that's been created in Channel 64, lore that's been created in other SMPs that get brought up in this.

114
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,641
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been...

115
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:24,977
[SPEAKER_02]: The most painful thing I've had to edit because like like put it this way so like a normal like Minecraft video that I put together and stuff like has you know it's like it's like say uh okay well a lot of these more recent ones okay so say like you know maybe

116
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:28,828
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 video files.

117
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:34,309
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, audio wise, there's like maybe 10 audio clips or something like that.

118
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,709
[SPEAKER_02]: This one has 344.

119
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,410
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 180.

120
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:45,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Last I count, there was 180, 190 replay mod shots that I had to create and edit.

121
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:50,272
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was probably two thirds of the way through the whole process.

122
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:52,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't even know what the new count is, but it's a lot.

123
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a lot of stuff and a lot of special effects things.

124
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:04,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to do a lot of AI voices, a lot of voice lines by our voice actors as well.

125
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:07,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot of everything.

126
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:14,399
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's action-packed, it's got emotional beats in there, it's just got everything.

127
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,398
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my pitch.

128
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:20,202
[SPEAKER_03]: You absolutely need to use your birthday to guilt people into watching it.

129
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,123
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I said earlier.

130
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:25,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I'm going to use those guilt points to get people to watch the video.

131
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:25,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

132
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,850
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it really is a good time.

133
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I poured everything into this, so I hope people enjoy it.

134
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:32,934
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

135
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:40,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we will look for that on the socials tomorrow, including the VOG Network Discord, where I know you'll post that over at VOGNetwork.com slash Discord.

136
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's VOGNetwork.com slash Discord.

137
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,180
[SPEAKER_03]: A great place to chat with us throughout the week.

138
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:58,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of birthdays, it is so tomorrow is your birthday, but I noticed in chat a reminder that today is PodCulture's birthday, which is funny because I actually got to see him at Dragon Con.

139
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,388
[SPEAKER_03]: where I was at last week.

140
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:02,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So happy birthday, Brad, from PodCulture.

141
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was great to see you in person last week.

142
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:13,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you are having the best I know you brought back a nasty souvenir from DragonCon, but I hope you are having the best birthday possible in light of all that.

143
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:13,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And

144
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:16,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hope everything's going great for you.

145
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:25,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And DragonCon, quickly, I will say, you know, I'm not going to go too much into depth in DragonCon, because I've talked a lot about it on this show.

146
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:29,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to nudge you over to our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.

147
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:36,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby and I not only did a DragonCon preview show before, but we did a DragonCon wrap up show earlier this week.

148
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:40,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to hear all about some of the details and some of our suggestions to make 2024 even better,

149
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:51,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to point you in that direction but I will just quickly say once again a big thank you to the video game track as well as the digital media track for having me back and taking part in some panels.

150
00:08:51,428 --> 00:09:09,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to moderate for the video game track a really cool panel on diversity in video games and the only bummer was that some of our speakers kind of had to back out at the last minute for whatever reason you know whether you know it's sickness or whatever conflict whatever so we only had it was me and two panelists

151
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:10,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you!

152
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:25,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

153
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every panel at DragonCon is streamed, because they kind of want you to go to DragonCon.

154
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one is not streamed.

155
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:54,475
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll just have to come next year to see a similar panel, hopefully.

156
00:09:54,475 --> 00:10:02,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But the digital media track panels, because the content is about digital media, it does make sense that that is then archived on digital media.

157
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:06,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will point you over to the YouTube channel for digital media,

158
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:09,083
[SPEAKER_03]: DcDigitalMedia

159
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:49,327
[SPEAKER_03]: and or VoB Kurt as I joke because it's actually VO or voiceover by Kurt but some people say it VoB Kurt and I think it sounds cute but that panel is it was thriving on streaming media when you're over 40 years old which to be honest a lot of people go how's that different from thriving when you're 20 and 30 excellent question

160
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:50,689
[SPEAKER_03]: We answer it in the panel.

161
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:53,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check it out over on YouTube.

162
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out for that panel.

163
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,139
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes.

164
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's that's my plug for DragonCon related content.

165
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:03,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks again for having me and I am already planning for 2024.

166
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,581
[SPEAKER_03]: as is Alan.

167
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan had remember this was Alan's first dragon con.

168
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:17,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And he saw enough in the con even though he was a little overwhelmed by I think just all the people and all the things there was to do it can it can absolutely be sensory overload.

169
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:22,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sometimes he's like, I see the potential and things I want to do next year.

170
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:23,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's gonna come back.

171
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:24,016
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.

172
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:28,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

173
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:38,660
[SPEAKER_03]: We missed quite a few things this last week, especially because at the same time Dragon Con is going on, and the Arcade Expo is going on as well as some other conventions around the country.

174
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,424
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a few headlines that came out from over the long weekend last weekend.

175
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:46,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I don't know if you want to jump into some of these or you want me to take?

176
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:46,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

177
00:11:47,828 --> 00:12:06,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know too much about the Final Fantasy 16 stuff because I haven't been paying attention to it, but I do remember though they did make the announcement that they are going to be doing a PC version that is in development and that there is also going to be some 2A DLCs that are going to be added as well and then they have an update that they've added to the game.

178
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:15,244
[SPEAKER_02]: The PC version I'm excited about because then I actually get to play it because I am not buying a console for a game, so sorry.

179
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:19,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are going to mod the hell out of it, so that's going to be interesting too.

180
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, like, yeah.

181
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:23,845
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.

182
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:28,848
[SPEAKER_03]: How many days until a nude Sid and a nude Clive mod?

183
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Less than zero.

184
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,293
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is though, do we get nude mod before we get CJ mod from San Andreas?

185
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, which one comes first?

186
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:40,254
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the better question now.

187
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:40,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, nude mod

188
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, guaranteed.

189
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: CJ mod, yep, guaranteed.

190
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:45,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But which one comes first?

191
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:47,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

192
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:48,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the new meta.

193
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:50,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta start betting on that stuff.

194
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:51,849
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

195
00:12:51,849 --> 00:13:01,918
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so they added an update which gave you a weapon skin feature and also the onion sword weapon and new outfits.

196
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,581
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course the two paid DLC.

197
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:08,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they go into detail what those are going to be about necessarily.

198
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:14,443
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not talk about specifics, at least as far as I caught, about what they will be about.

199
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:26,626
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of speculation that because Leviathan was missing from the lineup of icons, I keep wanting to say primals, because they are on 14,

200
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:27,346
[SPEAKER_03]: and

201
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:52,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Fast forward between the prologue and then what you see later in the game, or even before the prologue.

202
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:58,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's talks about that maybe the DLC will actually be a little more standalone, which could be interesting.

203
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:02,808
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'm okay with there being DLC.

204
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:14,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather see a 16.2 eventually that could fix some of the issues that 16 had, not just technically, but with lack of representation and things like that would be a great thing to add into the world.

205
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:19,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's why the PC version, you know, we can fix some of that.

206
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:21,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the DLC will address some of that.

207
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll go to another continent and we'll see a little more diversity.

208
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:24,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

209
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:27,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really early to say, but we'll see.

210
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,035
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see where it takes us.

211
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that in light of the stories we saw a couple of weeks ago where people were like, Final Fantasy 16 only sold three million copies or whatever it was.

212
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember how many copies it was.

213
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:41,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, Tomb Raider all over again.

214
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and all that stuff.

215
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:47,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm glad to hear it is doing well enough where they are talking about DLC.

216
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:51,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the PC version, come on, we all knew it was, we all knew it was coming.

217
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just some, some dumb arrangement that was keeping their lips sealed on that.

218
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:58,582
[SPEAKER_03]: But we all knew that was coming.

219
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:00,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Never do that.

220
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:02,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the that's what the competition does.

221
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's bad.

222
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,283
[SPEAKER_02]: We fight against that in the courts.

223
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:05,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.

224
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:07,023
[SPEAKER_02]: We would never do that.

225
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:07,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

226
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:08,204
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awful.

227
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:08,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

228
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:13,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's nice to see that that is all confirmed and all that good stuff.

229
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:15,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

230
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:15,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

231
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:16,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

232
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:17,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

233
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:17,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited for.

234
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:24,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and the other thing I know this probably is not on your list, but I want to say it about Final Fantasy 16 at PAX.

235
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little jealous.

236
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:29,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I am not jealous about the decision to go to Dragon Con over PAX.

237
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I've let my feelings be known on this show.

238
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.

239
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,771
[SPEAKER_03]: However.

240
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:34,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben Starr went to PAX.

241
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,459
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was a little jealous about that.

242
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:45,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wasn't the only one, several of the 16 voice actors all went to PAX because they did a panel where all this was basically announced.

243
00:15:45,985 --> 00:16:03,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was a little jealous about that and I'm hoping maybe DragonCon will get the 16 voice actors next year because I'll tell you, I would do just about anything, and I mean it, to moderate that panel with Ben Starr.

244
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

245
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about.

246
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get crazy, but just about anything.

247
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,021
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's all I have to say.

248
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,742
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit confused by Ben Starr.

249
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:16,402
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a little bit confused?

250
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:17,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't know who that is.

251
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:19,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's the he's the voice of Clive.

252
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:27,485
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ben Starr that... Because the Ben Starr I know of was on MasterChef and was really cool.

253
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Sexy Clive Voice Actor

254
00:16:48,356 --> 00:16:48,796
[SPEAKER_03]: What's his?

255
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:49,957
[SPEAKER_03]: What's his?

256
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:51,498
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a he has a Twitter account.

257
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:57,803
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where he posts all these things with like, you know, pretending to do voices of Mario and things like that.

258
00:16:57,803 --> 00:16:59,744
[SPEAKER_03]: He does all these things.

259
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:03,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just, he's, it's not just his looks.

260
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but the voice too.

261
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:05,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's those things together.

262
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:09,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's very, yes, that's all I'm gonna say.

263
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:10,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, next story, Loki.

264
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:11,472
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

265
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did a Nintendo Direct.

266
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, sorry, I'm having some lag.

267
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,255
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

268
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:18,738
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're fine.

269
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:19,140
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.

270
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,341
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.

271
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:28,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nintendo did a Super Mario Wonder Direct and showed off a little bit more of the game and some of the different gameplay elements to it.

272
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:38,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually watched this, it feels like ages ago at this point, but they showed off that this is the Flower Kingdom that you're in now, so not necessarily the Mushroom Kingdom.

273
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:43,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have six distinct worlds that are in this game.

274
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:45,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's kind of cool about that is there's

275
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the different levels that are in there you can actually tackle in any order that you want.

276
00:17:51,666 --> 00:18:05,723
[SPEAKER_02]: A little more disappointing though is the fact that all of the different characters that they have available, so like Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Toad, and Toadette all play the same.

277
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: which I feel is kind of like, you know, a missed opportunity.

278
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:29,569
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they do have, as part of that kind of being more open to gamers that may not necessarily be as good, they have Yoshi and Nabbit that have different effects to them that allows the game to be played in a way that, you know,

279
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:35,131
[SPEAKER_02]: is much easier, you know, with, of course, like the floaty jumps that Yoshi has.

280
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:39,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think also just not really being able to see.

281
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Yoshi.

282
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:43,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

283
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,355
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also ride Yoshi.

284
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else is playing them as well.

285
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:47,236
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

286
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:50,338
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed a bunch of new power ups, like the elephant fruit.

287
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:54,445
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can blow bubbles and whatnot with that.

288
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:55,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

289
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:58,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Very pretty looking game altogether.

290
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:17,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they also have this weird kind of multiplayer mode where you actually see other players running around in the game at the same time and you can even leave messages for them or like leave icons or it's almost like little cardboard cutouts that you leave in the game.

291
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you die,

292
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:24,200
[SPEAKER_02]: If that bubble hits that thing, then you come back to life or something like that.

293
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

294
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

295
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:41,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they talked about, like, kind of the flowers that you can get that kind of twist everything around, and those are in-game as well, and it looks pretty trippy, so... It's touch fuzzy, get dizzy vibes all over again, but, you know... Different drugs this time.

296
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:48,066
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is coming out in October on the 20th, so it looks pretty sweet.

297
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say I am definitely picking it up.

298
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:50,327
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks neat.

299
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:52,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's one of those things like how can you not pick it up?

300
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:54,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it looks really good.

301
00:19:54,048 --> 00:20:03,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do see where it's unfortunate that the characters don't have a little more of their personality like they did even as far back as Super Mario Brothers 2.

302
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:10,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But I get maybe for game balancing and what I really think they're going for, you know, it's it's Nintendo's bread and butter.

303
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:12,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It's multiplayer gaming on the couch.

304
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:15,837
[SPEAKER_03]: with young kids, hence the nabbit and all that stuff.

305
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:19,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's very much what they want to go for with this game.

306
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:25,740
[SPEAKER_03]: They want something that you unwrap under the proverbial Christmas tree or whatever it is you celebrate.

307
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You unwrap it and you go right to playing it with the whole family.

308
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,741
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very much the game they're going for.

309
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:31,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

310
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, honestly, these decisions are going to suit them fine.

311
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,703
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's going to do very well.

312
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:36,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

313
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:36,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

314
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:37,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

315
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a Mario game.

316
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not going to do not well.

317
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:48,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're also releasing a Special Edition Switch, well it's not even a Special Edition, I think it's the Red Switch that they had a while back with Odyssey.

318
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:54,295
[SPEAKER_02]: They're releasing it again now with Wonder in there as well.

319
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So, neat.

320
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:59,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, last but not least, Volition has been shut down.

321
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:16,215
[SPEAKER_02]: because the Embracer group, as part of their restructuring since they don't have that $2 billion of cash being pumped into their business, they have decided to shut down Volition.

322
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:25,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, yeah, I guess that's sad that Volition is shutting down, but, I mean, is it the same Volition that made some of the earlier Saints Row games?

323
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:26,443
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

324
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I kind of feel that, you know, being that

325
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:36,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Volition was at a point where fans were giving them feedback on the game.

326
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get it, fans can be terrible sometimes when it comes to games.

327
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:44,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But if everybody's saying the same thing, like, this game looks like it's awful.

328
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:51,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the idea of these main characters just being college kids that are trying to pay off student loans and then they turn to a life of crime.

329
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:53,424
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds really stupid and not gangsta.

330
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:56,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe take that feedback.

331
00:21:56,447 --> 00:22:01,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like the equivalent of, say, for example, the Sonic movie.

332
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:05,189
[SPEAKER_02]: If they release ugly Sonic in the trailers, everyone's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, this seems bad.

333
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, no, it's good.

334
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,089
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to keep it like this.

335
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:09,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better this way.

336
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And then being surprised, what?

337
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,730
[SPEAKER_02]: No one went to the box office to see our awful movie?

338
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm shocked.

339
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what we have here with Saints Row.

340
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:23,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, it was an awful game, premise-wise, and then awfully executed.

341
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:23,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like,

342
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:27,968
[SPEAKER_02]: the perfect storm of awfulness.

343
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And not even in a fun way, like a Bethesda way.

344
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:33,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest Buster in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

345
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:35,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember if I gave the plug.

346
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:41,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tape live Sunday nights, of course, at 9 Eastern, 6 Pacific over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

347
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:48,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And Quest Buster says, Volition News is sad, but after Agents of Mayhem in 2017, there were questions on what was going to happen with the studio.

348
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:54,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like, Loki, that's kind of got the vibe I got from your opinion, because at first I was like, oh, Loki's going to

349
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:54,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course...

350
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:31,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The core Saints Row games was Idle Ninja and unfortunately when he passed it was just any hope that we had left for the studio was just it died with him unfortunately and it's sad because you would hope that there are people that kind of want to bring that back and I get it like they were in a tough position like they had gone way too wacky with Saints Row it was just like off the rails crazy at that point

351
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:33,456
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have dialed it back.

352
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:37,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole fact that this is a reboot means you can dial it back to that earlier game.

353
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:43,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, all you had to do was recreate the kind of sandbox-y environment that you had in the original game.

354
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,923
[SPEAKER_02]: That sort of, you know, mentality used to add a solid story with the earlier games, and it had that grit on it.

355
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:52,364
[SPEAKER_02]: This has no grit on it.

356
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,325
[SPEAKER_02]: This is basically stupid characters that nobody likes,

357
00:23:56,105 --> 00:24:03,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And even worse, when you actually play through the game and you actually listen to your character, you hate them even more.

358
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That is poor writing.

359
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's poor writing, poor execution, poor everything.

360
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:20,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And even on top of all that, after all of that was done, they published the game, they still had the gall to put out DLC that was about LARPing.

361
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, LARPing in a gangster, you know,

362
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandbox Game, what the hell is that?

363
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it makes no sense whatsoever, and they just kept doubling and tripling down on this stuff.

364
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they had it coming.

365
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:41,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but like, if you keep making bad decisions over and over and over again, you're not gonna be operating anymore.

366
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:46,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure was interesting how Saints Row showed up on PlayStation Plus, like,

367
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:49,924
[SPEAKER_03]: a day after this announcement, you know what I mean?

368
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:56,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, wasn't this announcement tied with something like they really tried to sneak this announcement out there, like people would notice.

369
00:24:56,586 --> 00:25:00,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I want to say it came out the same time as like.

370
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:01,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Either it was on.

371
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:06,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It released on Steam, too, like the game released on Steam shortly before this announcement.

372
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:12,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the Volition news about the closure that they timed that very strange.

373
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

374
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:20,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I feel bad for the people that worked for Volition, but at the same time, like.

375
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:33,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm sorry, some accountability needs to be had, like, like, yeah, it feels bad for any developer to close down and the people that are affected by that, like, because there are a lot of people that like that, they were just doing what they're told and like making the best thing they could do it.

376
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,110
[SPEAKER_02]: But someone in the chain screwed that up big time.

377
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was more than just like a few people.

378
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of people that really screwed the pooch on that one.

379
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:42,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

380
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:55,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Volition had some great titles in their history, Red Faction, The Free Space, Space Sims, and Descent, but as Loki pointed out, most of the people that came with those likely left.

381
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:56,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

382
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And Red Faction, FreeSpace and a lot of stuff.

383
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they would put out more of those games, like I would have loved to see like, hey, I have an idea.

384
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:08,540
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know what to do with Saints Row, then don't do anything with it.

385
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a new Red Faction game and do that.

386
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:12,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could have taken that.

387
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:21,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it still may have been bad, but you could have at least taken Red Faction and like been able to stick with the space stuff and have an action game based off that.

388
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:25,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would probably have been more successful than this was, but they just

389
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:29,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they were thinking with this, honestly.

390
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:32,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like, after we saw the first trailer, it's like, ugh.

391
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:37,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after we learned more about the characters, like, oh, no, no, no, no.

392
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:39,564
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kept going with that.

393
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,065
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't know, like, oh, hey, we're listening to you.

394
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:42,865
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking your feedback.

395
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, nope.

396
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Going straight up with what we're doing.

397
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:53,693
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, I guess it's one of those things where it's it's it's a shock, but it's not a shock, right?

398
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:56,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, my gosh, they really did close the studio.

399
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go, well, you look at what's happened in the last seven years.

400
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:01,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that surprising.

401
00:27:01,176 --> 00:27:05,898
[SPEAKER_02]: The caveat with this, though, is Volition's gone, but that doesn't mean the Saints Row license is dead.

402
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:09,500
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give it to another studio and they can start from scratch.

403
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to say that I thought Gearbox was going to be doing something maybe with it, but like

404
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:30,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to somebody that, like Gearbox, like, whether you like Borderlands or, you know, some of that stuff, they have pretty good writers that understand context and understand humor and understand all that stuff, instead of just, like, making fart jokes all the time.

405
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that, it's just awful.

406
00:27:32,763 --> 00:27:34,506
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bad writing.

407
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:34,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

408
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:46,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that those folks would have a better time with something like this because they can have fun with it, they know how to make a solid engine, they know how to make a solid game.

409
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:47,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let somebody competent take it.

410
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:56,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that about covers some of the big headlines we missed from our week off, but we still have to get to this week's headlines.

411
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:57,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get to that shortly.

412
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:04,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, we're going to get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week or the last two weeks, I suppose.

413
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's kick it off.

414
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,178
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

415
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:08,239
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to DarkSakura.

416
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:10,740
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

417
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,922
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all right.

418
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:13,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

419
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:15,517
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I play?

420
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:22,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Cult of the Lamb today to show it off to a friend.

421
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:30,127
[SPEAKER_00]: I played, of course, I finished through all of the individual scenarios for Live Alive.

422
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:35,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually into like the main part of the end game.

423
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:40,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything has just frozen on me all of a sudden.

424
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:44,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

425
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:45,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

426
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:45,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

427
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:47,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed your avatar is frozen.

428
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:50,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know what happened.

429
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:54,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a bunch of stuff decided to freeze on me.

430
00:28:54,284 --> 00:29:02,408
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, I've... Also, we got Godzilla pinball temporarily.

431
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:06,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a little momentary trade for that.

432
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:12,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we got Galactic Tank Force, which is amazing and cheeseball.

433
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:16,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole readout part of it is like watching a Sega CD game.

434
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:16,674
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty...

435
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:20,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead by Daylight and Disney Dreamlight Valley.

436
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:23,513
[SPEAKER_00]: The Godzilla table is more fun than I thought it would be.

437
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:41,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, it's cool.

438
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:47,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and of course it ends in, uh, the, go Godzilla, you know, when you're done with your game.

439
00:29:47,671 --> 00:30:02,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, still playing Weird Al, um, and my, my stupid wordscape game that I'm, I'm feeling angry in a certain way about, cause it just, it takes money out of me and I don't want it to happen.

440
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people, it's awesome.

441
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

442
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked, I liked the whole like,

443
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:09,074
[SPEAKER_02]: vintage sci-fi stuff.

444
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,516
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks awesome.

445
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:14,517
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it's super good.

446
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:15,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fan.

447
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:19,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, does the table that you guys have, do you have the tank treads on the side, or is it just the table?

448
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,461
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not.

449
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:27,785
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the thing is, is that it comes with like a big cannon that attaches to the back of the table, you know, on the back glass area.

450
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,686
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you fold it down, it looks like the tank.

451
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:39,391
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's my jam or not, but it's a pretty sweet setup.

452
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:42,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the record, I'm relaunching all of my camera stuff.

453
00:30:42,993 --> 00:30:51,576
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I really, really have just been all over both of these tables.

454
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:52,676
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so much fun.

455
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:04,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a little bit of, um... Oh, what was it?

456
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,572
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh... I don't remember what it was I played.

457
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,652
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that I was trying out.

458
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:16,895
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did buy Baldur's Gate 3, because the Mac version is going to officially be out.

459
00:31:16,895 --> 00:31:26,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the version that you can play is the last build for it, like, of the betas, before they released it, so...

460
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:34,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling pretty okay about it.

461
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:39,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think I see what's happening with my camera.

462
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:51,549
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I mean, there's so much stuff for me to play at my house now that I don't even know, like, what else to play.

463
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,211
[SPEAKER_00]: We've organized the game room now.

464
00:31:54,345 --> 00:32:00,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'm really hoping that, uh, we can actually get the whole classic game set up back again.

465
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:11,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm looking forward to, to making the best out of that, but right now it's just been my usual and a lot of pinball.

466
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,879
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

467
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:13,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how about you?

468
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been working on a video, but anything else that you gave me week?

469
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:17,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

470
00:32:17,423 --> 00:32:20,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I was editing the entire time, unfortunately.

471
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I did play Minecraft, but in the sense that I was using it to edit.

472
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

473
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:28,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it was only that, unfortunately.

474
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:28,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been busy.

475
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:36,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I noticed through the social medias that like the net the Minecraft championship not rising is happening soon, right?

476
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:52,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've seen some of the programs we can because I've interacted with posts when you were doing it now like reading replies and stuff that now it pushes all that stuff to my for you page, which I try not to read but like always defaults to that I can't help but see some of it, you know, so I just I thought the other thought of you the other

477
00:32:52,586 --> 00:33:12,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannon event this weekend on the 16th at noon Pacific and then there's a special thing that they're doing in collaboration with Twitch rivals at TwitchCon that they're doing an in-person Minecraft MCC thing.

478
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:20,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's supposed to be different though, that's non-canon and I think it's with fewer players, so I'm not sure what they're doing with that, but that'll be interesting too.

479
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:26,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost want to go to TwitchCon for that, but I can't because it's too soon.

480
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:31,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I will get B-roll for you, or Jamie will, because it's in both our plans, so...

481
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:34,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe that might be something.

482
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm five weeks away TwitchCon.

483
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:37,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

484
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be something to look forward to maybe next year or something like that.

485
00:33:42,744 --> 00:33:43,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, would be cool.

486
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,804
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, my gaming week.

487
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:51,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so obviously, I was was busy with travel to Dragon Con and doing the convention.

488
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, they had a nice arcade there at the convention.

489
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:56,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was it was cool.

490
00:33:56,553 --> 00:34:02,177
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of had two vendors that were merged together into one long arcade.

491
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:05,720
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the joystick game bar, which was like classic games.

492
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to remember what I played in the classic arcade.

493
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:09,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mortal Kombat 2.

494
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:10,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember playing that.

495
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:29,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing a little bit of that and the save point was the group that brought the import games.

496
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:38,952
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually had a working Technica machine, which I hadn't seen in a while, so I could actually play Flea, which is my favorite song in Technica, and they also

497
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,034
[SPEAKER_03]: had a Space Harrier machine.

498
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought of Jamie again.

499
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:45,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't take a picture this time because somebody was playing it when I walked by it.

500
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,726
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I saw that.

501
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, YYR, that was literally your machine I was playing?

502
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,374
[SPEAKER_03]: That is funny or used to be, I guess.

503
00:34:57,374 --> 00:34:58,135
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

504
00:34:58,135 --> 00:34:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

505
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:00,075
[SPEAKER_03]: What a small world.

506
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:01,515
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well, thanks, YYR.

507
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:06,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So your arcade machine got to DragonCon before you did.

508
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:08,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to think about that for a minute.

509
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:10,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just messing.

510
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:13,017
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's cool that I played that.

511
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:15,018
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they had a lot of other like dance games.

512
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:18,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the dance games were super popular and people were lining up for them.

513
00:35:18,538 --> 00:35:20,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I've played plenty of dance games in my time.

514
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:30,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally ponied up the money to get the Nintendo Expansion Pack for Nintendo Switch Online because I finally just wanted to play some of the Game Boy Advance games.

515
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:40,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of Mario Advance and Mario Advance 2, which is actually Super Mario 2 is the original Advance and the Super Mario World is Advance 2.

516
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was playing a little bit of that.

517
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:44,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a lot of fun.

518
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:45,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I played on that.

519
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:47,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I got back, boy, oh boy,

520
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,980
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just been games coming out left and right.

521
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So like DarkSakura, I have picked up Baldur's Gate 3.

522
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it yet, though, but that's coming this next week.

523
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:04,243
[SPEAKER_03]: You all know the individual in my life that can talk me into buying a game so that we can play it together.

524
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:06,483
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very good at convincing people to do things.

525
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:08,624
[SPEAKER_03]: So please look forward to that.

526
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:17,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, in addition to that, I picked up Starfield since that is, you know, of course on Game Pass.

527
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:23,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I think many of you were doing what I was doing this week and checking out Starfield with my Game Pass subscription.

528
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:25,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.

529
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:29,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure how I felt about Starfield at first.

530
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:37,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little bit, you know, especially coming from something like No Man's Sky, which is like relatively simple exploration and very chill.

531
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:39,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's a lot more

532
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:43,646
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and micromanaging types of things.

533
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:45,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Bethesda game, right?

534
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:46,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Bethesda game.

535
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:49,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to think about how much you're carrying.

536
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:55,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're setting up the bases, do you have the material, the right way to do this and farming stuff and

537
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,542
[SPEAKER_03]: What really bothered me was the space flight.

538
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:04,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not care for the space flight and how much was going into that as opposed to No Man's Sky.

539
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:12,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Now granted, the game will let you kind of skip a lot of space flight after the tutorial because you can just fast travel to different places.

540
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:14,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is nice.

541
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:17,014
[SPEAKER_03]: They do put some quality of life things in there.

542
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:20,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, I wasn't quite sure I was feeling the game at first.

543
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:37,659
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really sat down with it and there was some point where, and again I'm trying to keep it light on spoilers, but you get a companion pretty early on in the game and she wants to go do this certain mission and you're in our solar system that we know today.

544
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:45,285
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it in the game Sol, S-O-L, but it's the solar system we know today except something has happened to Earth.

545
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:52,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a big desert now, which probably is just a commentary on climate change and all of that because that's, you know, probably more likely than you think.

546
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:55,636
[SPEAKER_03]: But nobody lives on it anymore.

547
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:58,457
[SPEAKER_03]: But you get to go to the moon.

548
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:06,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And your companion actually says, if you want to go land on the moon and just play around a little bit, which is funny, because other people I talked to, I guess, didn't get this dialogue option.

549
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:10,904
[SPEAKER_03]: But because I went diplomat, I think I get maybe some expanded options.

550
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:14,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe I'm not picking the same things in the dialogue tree that some of you are doing.

551
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:17,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So she said, Yeah, if you want to go down to the moon, we could do it.

552
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:18,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't pop it up.

553
00:38:18,648 --> 00:38:20,029
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just a suggestion she made.

554
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:21,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't pop a new question or anything.

555
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went down to the moon, I landed in a very random spot.

556
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:30,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was just, oh, there's Bobby, there was no Bobby BlackWolf in chat says I have no moon landing spots.

557
00:38:30,654 --> 00:38:32,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither did I, I just picked one.

558
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:35,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said we're gonna land here and did it.

559
00:38:35,536 --> 00:38:41,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to a very random moon base that was probably procedurally generated.

560
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:47,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up a quest from some humans that wanted me to go blast some pirates nearby to heaven.

561
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:48,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went

562
00:38:48,621 --> 00:39:09,400
[SPEAKER_03]: and explored this base for like 90 minutes because I couldn't I didn't I thought this room had a window over it and it turns out it wasn't you could actually jump through the window and so I ran around in circles for like 30 minutes trying to figure this out but once I figured it out I was like okay that actually did feel very rewarding and that was kind of neat

563
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:24,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I feel like the game is growing on me more, but I just I get like the overwhelming analysis paralysis that comes with a lot of Bethesda games, when it's like, there's a table over here, and there's crafting you can do here.

564
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:31,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's all these things you can pick up here, but don't pick up too much because you'll be weighted down and lose oxygen faster.

565
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:37,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess there's, there's plenty of places you can transfer inventory to like your companion or the ship, but it's,

566
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:39,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot.

567
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:39,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot.

568
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:47,874
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, like it's growing on me and my impressions of Starfield are favorable, but it just took me a minute to get there.

569
00:39:47,874 --> 00:39:50,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of where I'm at with that game.

570
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:58,260
[SPEAKER_03]: One other game I want to talk about, which, again, just a random thing that came out the last couple weeks that I think for a lot of you is probably going to be Blink and You Miss It.

571
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to mention this game and you're going to say, oh, yeah, that did come out.

572
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:04,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch.

573
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:05,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch your reaction.

574
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:05,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

575
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:25,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also checked out this week the Digital Eclipse, I think they call it Gold Series look back of The Making of Karateka, which The Making of Karateka is all about the 1980s Apple II game Karateka, which was ported to the Commodore 64.

576
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:28,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, you know, it's very well known for that tune.

577
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:30,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ported to the Atari, one of the early Ataris as well.

578
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:34,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually ported some other things to the game does get into this.

579
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So

580
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:45,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's set up similarly to Atari 50 in that they have all these old letters you can read and they have documentary style videos that are spliced in that you can watch.

581
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:52,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do some really cool things because the whole thing with Karateka and why it was important.

582
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:56,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, funny enough, Fifth Dream in chat says, does that tell how it's actually pronounced now?

583
00:40:56,572 --> 00:40:56,632
[SPEAKER_03]: LOL.

584
00:40:57,773 --> 00:40:58,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.

585
00:40:58,754 --> 00:41:02,236
[SPEAKER_03]: So there actually is a video that directly addresses this.

586
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And the creator of the game, Jordan, comes up and says, I call it Karateka.

587
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,763
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I always called it, he says, but apparently everybody else called it Karateka.

588
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:18,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, and actually, if you go to Japan, there is no emphasis on any syllable.

589
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:22,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people in Japan called it kind of

590
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:23,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Karateka.

591
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:23,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Karateka.

592
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:44,714
[SPEAKER_03]: but it is what it is.

593
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:49,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So he has said he accepts all pronunciations of the game and that is the official answer.

594
00:41:49,658 --> 00:42:03,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just say Karate-ka because that's just, but it's funny because they interview professionals and other developers and things and there is somebody in the video who says, well, I just always thought it was Karate and then Ka, so I always said Karate-ka and I was like, that's it, same brain.

595
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:05,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where my brain always went when I was younger.

596
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:06,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

597
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:12,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was, that was it was neat that it answered questions like that.

598
00:42:12,184 --> 00:42:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: But some other neat modes is that like, the whole reason why it was infamous in gaming was that it was really a step forward for cinematic games.

599
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:26,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way this is all laid out, and the story that it tells in the game really lays that out.

600
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:31,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because Jordan used a, and I'm not remembering his last name in the minute, but

601
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:33,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Belkner.

602
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:33,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be getting there.

603
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very sorry.

604
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,463
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also the same guy that made Prince of Persia.

605
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:36,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Mechner.

606
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:38,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

607
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:41,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan Mechner made the game.

608
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:46,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And he used a trick that old Disney animators used in Snow White called rotoscoping.

609
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So he actually shot his dad

610
00:42:49,577 --> 00:43:12,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Filming different karate things he had a karate teacher do some stuff, but they didn't have that actual super 8 film footage But they had his dad climbing up onto the hood of the car And they showed how that actually became the protagonist climbing up the cliff in the first scene of the game And they used rotoscoping which is basically putting traceable paper over the super 8 footage one frame at a time

611
00:43:12,446 --> 00:43:14,527
[SPEAKER_03]: to basically make the sprites and clean that up.

612
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:16,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why that game was so fluid.

613
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:22,471
[SPEAKER_03]: But they also talk about other ways that that game became more cinematic.

614
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:26,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And it talks about how Choplifter was very inspiring and making the game more cinematic.

615
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:29,434
[SPEAKER_03]: It really tells the story about how he

616
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: did these earlier games.

617
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:38,596
[SPEAKER_03]: He was trying to sell a game called Death Bounce, which was essentially, long story short, an asteroid clone.

618
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:43,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Copy, copy, like just refined, refined, refined to its whole new thing that he just really wasn't able to sell to Broderbund.

619
00:43:43,861 --> 00:43:46,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just kind of had an awakening when he played Choplifter.

620
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,485
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, why am I trying to make an arcade game?

621
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:55,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games now, because they are on computers and you own them, they can be cinematic experiences.

622
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he decided he was going to make a cinematic game.

623
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:04,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where Karateka came from, and how he ended up making that game.

624
00:44:04,157 --> 00:44:06,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the very end, it kind of teases that like,

625
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Persia was the next game, but that's another story.

626
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:16,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Wink, wink, nudge, like the series might explore that as well in the future.

627
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:20,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby points out he wanted a game that ended with the end and not game over.

628
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:26,907
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, the making of Karateka does a very good job because you can play, like, they talk about all of these prototypes.

629
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:33,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to play the very original prototype that Jordan Mechner sent to BrotoBun, you can play that prototype.

630
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,013
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to play his asteroid clone that he made, you can play that.

631
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:40,115
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to play Death Bounce, you can play that.

632
00:44:40,115 --> 00:44:42,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they actually did reimagined.

633
00:44:42,237 --> 00:44:48,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So Digital Eclipse made reimagined versions of Death Bounce and Karateka.

634
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:51,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're both very good for reimagined games.

635
00:44:51,343 --> 00:45:02,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Digital Eclipse has been in the game for a while, but whoever worked on those reimagines, especially the Death Bounce reimagining, because that game never was released, technically, because they just didn't see a releasable.

636
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:02,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they saw

637
00:45:03,152 --> 00:45:08,117
[SPEAKER_03]: They saw a releasable game in it, but they wanted to make all these changes that Jordan didn't really want to do.

638
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:10,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go in and play that.

639
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought the remastered Death Bounce was really cool.

640
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:18,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, Bobby points out, you can actually watch somebody else play the game and jump in at any point.

641
00:45:19,188 --> 00:45:23,112
[SPEAKER_03]: There's apparently 14 different games in there.

642
00:45:23,112 --> 00:45:29,998
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's when I say different games, it's like 10 of them are Karateka and two of them are Death Bounce and two of them are the Asteroid clones.

643
00:45:29,998 --> 00:45:34,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really just a handful, but you can play the Commodore 64 clone.

644
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:42,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually have the developer of the 64 version of Karateka named I think Veda Cook is her name.

645
00:45:44,108 --> 00:46:02,682
[SPEAKER_03]: which um she's trans and so she's not credited appropriately in the old version of the game so i was surprised that they did not go back and fix that in the Commodore 64 version of the game but perhaps uh they couldn't at this point i don't know what happened to the source code it could be lost to time or something of that

646
00:46:03,002 --> 00:46:06,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thought it was very cool because she explains her relationship with Jordan.

647
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:14,612
[SPEAKER_03]: And how they you know, she was basically handpicked to do the Commodore 64 port and the Atari port, which I thought it was just a really good story.

648
00:46:14,612 --> 00:46:16,814
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's lots of really good stories.

649
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:18,676
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it was all laid out like a museum.

650
00:46:19,036 --> 00:46:20,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed as well.

651
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really like an interactive museum.

652
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:24,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I know I'm talking a lot about this game.

653
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, Bobby and I've talked about maybe doing a deeper dive video for the network later on.

654
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:30,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So I should save some thoughts for that.

655
00:46:30,422 --> 00:46:33,384
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will just say I was I was very impressed by this.

656
00:46:33,384 --> 00:46:36,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And for 20 bucks, it's not a bad deal.

657
00:46:36,185 --> 00:46:37,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna be honest.

658
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:41,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I did play Karateka on the Commodore 64.

659
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:42,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like it as a kid.

660
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:43,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was too hard.

661
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:44,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was too difficult.

662
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

663
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:47,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was too difficult.

664
00:46:47,111 --> 00:46:47,972
[SPEAKER_03]: They never got very far.

665
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:57,922
[SPEAKER_03]: But going through this experience gave me an appreciation of like, oh, okay, I see why like this is important.

666
00:46:57,922 --> 00:47:00,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I see how this got to this in gaming.

667
00:47:00,845 --> 00:47:07,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that, you know, the museum element, the documentary stuff kind of told its own story, I thought was really well done.

668
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:13,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I do have some places I would give constructive feedback, but I'll save that for another time because I've talked about this long enough.

669
00:47:13,893 --> 00:47:18,379
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's, there's some parts that were glossed over a little bit for me.

670
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just wondering if it was a rights issue or what, because, okay, I'll quickly say, he made another game.

671
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:25,947
[SPEAKER_03]: that I

672
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:50,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, I mean, the issues I have with it are pretty nitpicky.

673
00:47:50,780 --> 00:48:02,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a first release in a gold master series, I'm really curious what other games they've got lined up, because they call it number one, it's even on the logo of the game, gold master number one.

674
00:48:02,063 --> 00:48:05,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, they've got a queue of other games they're going to do.

675
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:11,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I could theorize a guess what some of the other games could be Prince of Persia is an obvious one.

676
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I thought it was interesting.

677
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: They interview John Tobias from Mortal Kombat.

678
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:21,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure why they're interviewing.

679
00:48:21,224 --> 00:48:24,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe because he also made a martial arts game.

680
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:30,576
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if you were interviewing him for something else and you just decided to ask a few questions about Karateka as well?

681
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:30,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

682
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:51,842
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if they were to do one for the original World of Combat, because you know all that motion cap stuff is out there, we were talking about this with DragonCon last year, one of the panels that Bobby got to do, there was some behind the scenes footage of them doing the mocap that they actually showed that had never been seen before, and when I kind of put that

683
00:48:52,342 --> 00:49:01,229
[SPEAKER_03]: together with what I was watching in the Karateka thing, I was like, Oh, fuck, I hope the I hope Mortal Kombat one is like their next museum thing, because that would be incredible.

684
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't know how rights issues would play into that.

685
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a pie in the sky thought that would be amazing.

686
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:18,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I also noticed they had somebody from ID software, also seemingly randomly interviewed, who happened to be showing off a five and a quarter floppy with return return to Castle Wolfenstein on it.

687
00:49:18,662 --> 00:49:19,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Hmm,

688
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:25,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Wolfenstein 3D could be a very interesting one.

689
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:31,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, all my all my thought is is like, I hope there are more.

690
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:41,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do do check this out if this sounds appealing to you and show digital clips and the folks that are involved that we are wanting more of these because I thought it was well done.

691
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:44,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really excited for the potential of some of these other things.

692
00:49:44,454 --> 00:49:48,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I am completely making educated guesses based on

693
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:53,797
[SPEAKER_03]: These seem to be random people being grabbed for an interview, but maybe it's not that random.

694
00:49:53,797 --> 00:49:54,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

695
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:54,578
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

696
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:59,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifth Dream in chat says just do every game for real.

697
00:49:59,805 --> 00:50:06,549
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but really though, like there's probably a lot of other deep cuts I would have never thought of to do this.

698
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:09,671
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would have never thought I needed a look back at Karateka.

699
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:13,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like I said, when I was a kid, I didn't know better.

700
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:16,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have the appreciation for games that I do now.

701
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:17,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't care for it.

702
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:19,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I haven't thought about it since.

703
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:22,040
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks to this experience, I've kind of gone, Oh, wow.

704
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:31,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I, this is, okay, I get why this game was important, I get the impact that it had on other people, and I get the story about this.

705
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:36,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I mean, I think that says it all right there on why they wanted to do this in the first place, so.

706
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,472
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's plenty for me.

707
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:39,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked a lot about that game.

708
00:50:39,593 --> 00:50:44,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So but I had a feeling a lot of you would be like, Oh, yeah, that came out.

709
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:47,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Just reminding you because don't don't miss it.

710
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to see more in this series.

711
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:49,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we really do.

712
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It is out on Switch, PC and PlayStation.

713
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:55,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure about Xbox.

714
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:25,662
[SPEAKER_03]: question mark somebody would have to fact check that and verify I picked it up on PS5 personally because I was just like I like my PS5 and I thought trophies might be fun and I unlocked like two trophies so sadly no trophy for getting 100% on the museum I thought for sure that would be a thing but that's all right okay let's move on and get into some of the other gaming news from this week Loki we will go over to you oh thank you YYR who says yes it's on Xbox thank you okay yeah Loki

715
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:28,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Playstation Plus is getting more expensive.

716
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:54,603
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be raising the prices across the board for each of the different tiers, and some even more expensive than $20.

717
00:51:54,603 --> 00:51:58,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right now in the U.S., PlayStation Plus Essentials 12-month subscription

718
00:52:00,203 --> 00:52:02,124
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be going up from $59.99 to $79.99.

719
00:52:02,124 --> 00:52:03,945
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Plus Extras 12 month subscription is now up to $134.99 from $99.99.

720
00:52:03,945 --> 00:52:05,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like 35 bucks right there.

721
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:09,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And then PlayStation Plus Premium 12 month subscription going up from $119.99 to $159.99.

722
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:09,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So $40.

723
00:52:09,587 --> 00:52:09,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Not

724
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:36,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounded like a great deal to me, but I don't know, maybe.

725
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:39,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, across the board, yeah, it's getting more expensive.

726
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the reasoning for that?

727
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:44,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

728
00:52:44,612 --> 00:52:47,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably adding more stuff to the service, I guess.

729
00:52:47,153 --> 00:52:57,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high quality games and value added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.

730
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:57,758
[SPEAKER_02]: That's vague.

731
00:52:59,892 --> 00:53:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

732
00:53:01,752 --> 00:53:05,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep that in mind when you're subscribing to PlayStation Plus, I guess.

733
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:13,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the only thing that stinks about that is that a lot of people feel like, excuse me, a large part of their gaming library is being held ransom.

734
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:19,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you don't keep your subscription to PlayStation Plus going, you lose access to all those games you got through PlayStation Plus.

735
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:23,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what is unclear, and maybe somebody in chat knows the answer to this.

736
00:53:23,397 --> 00:53:28,598
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were to drop PlayStation Plus and pick it back up later, do I get access to those games back?

737
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:30,859
[SPEAKER_03]: or is my license okay?

738
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:31,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank heavens.

739
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:40,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that makes me feel better about maybe dropping it because I think I might.

740
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:42,024
[SPEAKER_03]: My renewal comes up in like November.

741
00:53:42,024 --> 00:53:44,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I play enough online.

742
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:48,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we need to send a message to Sony.

743
00:53:48,127 --> 00:53:50,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not enough to do that myself.

744
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:54,176
[SPEAKER_03]: The three of us are not enough to do it ourselves.

745
00:53:54,176 --> 00:54:02,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Even heck, between all of us, the 50 of us, you know, live and all that stuff, I'm being very generous, are probably not enough to have that big of an impact.

746
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:03,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

747
00:54:03,342 --> 00:54:12,608
[SPEAKER_03]: If we all tell friends, and we know other people feel this too, if we all are so bold as to stop our subs, Sony's going to get the message that they need to make it worth it.

748
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:19,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think they'll drop the price, but they're going to add to the pot and make a compelling reason on why we need to get the PlayStation subscription.

749
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as it is right now,

750
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:22,447
[SPEAKER_03]: What's

751
00:54:43,654 --> 00:55:06,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It's especially bad on the Xbox side of things when real and I don't want to make this a fanboy thing because it's it really isn't that different but it's more obvious on the Xbox side of the house because on your Xbox series you have to pay to do multiplayer but when you're using games for Windows you don't and it's it's a really weird thing now maybe I notice it less and I'm bitching less about Microsoft because well at least

752
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when I'm paying for the sub with Microsoft, I'm paying for Game Pass Ultimate at this point, which yes, I know, technically, I don't need Ultimate.

753
00:55:14,112 --> 00:55:24,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, whatever, I'm getting to play things like Starfield, eventually, Sea of Stars is on my radar as well from that and other things with Game Pass where I'm like, okay, whatever, I'm paying for it all with one bundle fee.

754
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:33,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't feel like quite the kick to the dick that this PlayStation price increase does where it's like, okay, you're literally not

755
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,588
[SPEAKER_03]: making this worth it.

756
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:37,369
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a ransom thing.

757
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:41,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me more money for no reason.

758
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just don't know.

759
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:47,011
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it hasn't really been something that I've been interested in.

760
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:52,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly not anymore because I don't really play games on the PlayStation 4 anymore.

761
00:55:52,072 --> 00:55:54,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just collecting dust, unfortunately.

762
00:55:54,593 --> 00:55:57,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

763
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:01,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Even now, I look at PlayStation or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

764
00:56:02,762 --> 00:56:05,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $17 a month US, that ends up being $204 a year.

765
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:11,728
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.

766
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you break it down like that, that is quite a bit.

767
00:56:15,689 --> 00:56:18,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than what Sony's service is.

768
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,891
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I don't know, it just doesn't seem that bad to me.

769
00:56:22,891 --> 00:56:30,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if you like, break it down- Well, when I'm playing a $70 game right now, I only have to do that three times through the year to technically get the value out of it, right?

770
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:31,614
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true, yeah.

771
00:56:31,614 --> 00:56:33,775
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is, I think.

772
00:56:34,512 --> 00:56:41,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So and and I mean, from what I understand with Sony's service is they're not putting their first party games on there right away.

773
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not day and date with launches, if I'm correct, because they want you to buy those because they feel that their games are worth the money and they want you to pay the money, even though you pay for their service, but they want you to buy it up front.

774
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:57,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, if they're gracious enough, they'll give it to you for free.

775
00:56:57,202 --> 00:57:00,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, I would say Sony is probably right.

776
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:04,768
[SPEAKER_03]: They are worth the money, but so are the so are the things that Microsoft is putting out, you know, exactly.

777
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:05,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

778
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane is in our chat.

779
00:57:08,511 --> 00:57:17,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadley Lynn says, I actually cancelled my renewal because their justification of the increase is pathetic and vastly overstated the quality of their offerings.

780
00:57:17,077 --> 00:57:19,159
[SPEAKER_03]: No more online games or extra games.

781
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired of arrogant Sony this generation.

782
00:57:22,181 --> 00:57:24,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That last sentence says a lot.

783
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I agree with it a lot.

784
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,328
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, I'm also tired of arrogant Sony this generation.

785
00:57:32,508 --> 00:57:40,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't like to root for people getting L's in the gaming industry because I know a lot of people get affected by that.

786
00:57:40,372 --> 00:57:43,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to say such sweeping things.

787
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:45,014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like everybody there ought to be fired.

788
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,775
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not that's not how I really feel.

789
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:55,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that like like you were saying earlier during the Volition story, people that didn't make the decisions on where to go with the story were impacted by the game.

790
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:57,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's too bad.

791
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: But there comes there comes a point where I'm like, you know what?

792
00:58:01,904 --> 00:58:06,032
[SPEAKER_03]: When the PSVR2 flops, I'm not gonna be sad for Sony.

793
00:58:06,663 --> 00:58:20,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the way I see it like this is desperation breeds innovation, because if they are put in last place like they were with like PlayStation 3, they tried harder when PlayStation 4 came out.

794
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:24,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when we got LittleBigPlanet and like some really rad games, right?

795
00:58:24,392 --> 00:58:27,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, yeah, I think Sony should feel the heat a little bit.

796
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:33,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's I'm not sure they learned from what happened with the PS3 because this is

797
00:58:34,007 --> 00:58:37,397
[SPEAKER_03]: This carries a very similar weight to the phrase $599 USD.

798
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:46,194
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, I mean, because their console's expensive.

799
00:58:46,194 --> 00:59:00,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Just even the proposition of PlayStation VR right now, I've completely just given up any sort of hope to actually play my wonderful spiritual successor to Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

800
00:59:00,105 --> 00:59:06,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm not buying the system and the VR for like, what, is it going to be close to $1,000 at that point?

801
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:13,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks, I'm good, you know, and I just will skip Sony this generation.

802
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:18,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, like, considering how much I play my Xbox, which is not at all, it's in a box.

803
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:24,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just skip consoles this next generation too, because PC is the way to go.

804
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:25,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get the best of everything.

805
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I get all of the games.

806
00:59:27,473 --> 00:59:31,353
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this BS about paying for multiplayer online.

807
00:59:31,353 --> 00:59:42,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And like if they start pulling this, I was like, OK, well, I'll just play thousands of other games that are available all through all these marketplaces because of competition and competition pushes those prices down.

808
00:59:42,216 --> 00:59:43,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a walled garden.

809
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:46,296
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pay whatever they're telling you to pay.

810
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:48,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's needling you in chat saying you only play Minecraft anyway.

811
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:50,696
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

812
00:59:50,696 --> 00:59:52,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, you are absolutely correct.

813
00:59:52,858 --> 01:00:02,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I am hyper focused on Minecraft, but I but that is to say, you know, and because I have a horrible habit of doing this, I still buy a lot of games.

814
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't play them.

815
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:07,990
[SPEAKER_02]: But I buy lots of games on PC.

816
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

817
01:00:08,635 --> 01:00:09,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll play eventually.

818
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:13,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I retire, I'll be dead before that happens.

819
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:19,444
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like, it'll be just, you know, they'll be there so that somebody can play them someday.

820
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:23,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I will just collect them like you would, like, I don't know, bobbleheads or something.

821
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane in chat says, remember when everyone was crapping on Nintendo for their service and price?

822
01:00:28,664 --> 01:00:33,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It honestly feels like the best value to me right now for the price, the NSO plus expansion.

823
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:35,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do remember that because I was one of the people crapping on it.

824
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:41,674
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say I thought you'll notice two years later, I finally did sign up this week because I was like, you know what?

825
01:00:41,674 --> 01:00:44,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they've added a lot to NSO.

826
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, on N64 and Advance and even just you know, I was like, Oh, I could get those Mario Kart tracks and stuff for free.

827
01:00:50,742 --> 01:00:51,562
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

828
01:00:51,562 --> 01:00:52,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.

829
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna finally sign up for that.

830
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:57,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So it took me a little while to get there, but like, yeah, like, honestly.

831
01:00:57,827 --> 01:01:03,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing I just want to say about PSVR 2 real quick is that, you know, and I've said this before, but I'll say it again.

832
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:12,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very sad that Sony is not learning this lesson because I really feel like the PSVR 2 is destined for the similar fate, the PlayStation Vita, the PlayStation TV.

833
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:18,020
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a terrific piece of hardware, horribly supported by Sony.

834
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, I don't understand why.

835
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:32,023
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to, like, honestly, like, I think the best course of action for Sony and something like that, and it's like, I get it, you gotta push those graphics and everything, but you gotta develop something like the MetaQuest.

836
01:01:32,023 --> 01:01:40,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, honestly, because that is, as much as I hate meta, like, that piece of hardware is, like, my kids play that all the time.

837
01:01:41,392 --> 01:02:08,234
[SPEAKER_02]: like all the time and they love it's just so easy to use and it's it's decent enough to run games and you know pretty decent games so all they need to do is just something like that that's not attached to a $500 console and I get it like you know it pushes the graphics and stuff but is it really worth it to like be that high end on that because like you're really narrowing the market like if you expand it make it more broad you could have a thing take off like

838
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:13,709
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, imagine Sony titles on like, you know, a Quest type of product where it's easy.

839
01:02:13,709 --> 01:02:22,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like a couple hundred bucks to get in and then you're playing the Sony catalog stuff like that's what they need to do, not wall it off with a thousand dollars worth.

840
01:02:22,497 --> 01:02:26,400
[SPEAKER_02]: How well is that going to work for for Apple with their thing?

841
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:33,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's an amazing piece of hardware, but it's just like no one's going to buy it because it's so expensive.

842
01:02:33,026 --> 01:02:33,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing.

843
01:02:33,746 --> 01:02:36,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's we're waiting for all these prices to come down, but just

844
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:38,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

845
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they need to do something that's its own thing.

846
01:02:40,973 --> 01:02:43,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get a couple other comments out here and then I'll move on to the next story for time.

847
01:02:43,995 --> 01:02:49,180
[SPEAKER_03]: But Crystal Skies in our chat, hello, hello, says they need to make it backwards compatible.

848
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:55,185
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that was a problem is that they did make a hardware design choice to it.

849
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:58,788
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't make it backwards compatible because the VR works in a completely different way.

850
01:02:58,788 --> 01:03:01,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why you're seeing things like No Man's Sky,

851
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:12,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Tetris effect and things getting like re-released for PSVR 2, because they really are new releases, because they have to adapt to the new way that PlayStation VR 2 handles VR versus the first.

852
01:03:12,553 --> 01:03:13,673
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a choice they made.

853
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:18,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I, I get why they did it, because that's where the tech is going.

854
01:03:18,714 --> 01:03:23,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does allow them, you know, probably a better VR experience at the end of the day.

855
01:03:23,455 --> 01:03:24,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it does suck.

856
01:03:24,336 --> 01:03:25,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's just like that.

857
01:03:25,576 --> 01:03:29,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way a lot of people see it, is that comment right there.

858
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:29,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes.

859
01:03:30,608 --> 01:03:42,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the problem is what it's always been is some of these consoles that they put out, you know, and I'm considering this like a console almost for Sony is they don't have the must have system seller game on it.

860
01:03:42,512 --> 01:03:44,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the Horizon game.

861
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,353
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't it.

862
01:03:45,353 --> 01:03:47,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that was just not a neat experience, though.

863
01:03:47,854 --> 01:03:49,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get to mess around that.

864
01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:49,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yeah.

865
01:03:49,874 --> 01:03:52,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby and Chad says the tech and PSVR2 is pretty good.

866
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:53,976
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

867
01:03:53,976 --> 01:03:57,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if they just would put the first party games behind it,

868
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:06,482
[SPEAKER_02]: to really sell it, like give it a Half-Life Alyx or something, you know, like a God of War game, like Warrior Kratos and you're throwing the axe and stuff like that.

869
01:04:06,482 --> 01:04:08,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that could be really sweet.

870
01:04:08,623 --> 01:04:12,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a Spider-Man game, like swinging around on a web and stuff like that.

871
01:04:12,586 --> 01:04:14,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds motion sick, though.

872
01:04:14,307 --> 01:04:14,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

873
01:04:14,627 --> 01:04:15,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

874
01:04:15,087 --> 01:04:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

875
01:04:15,568 --> 01:04:16,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm it down a little bit.

876
01:04:16,528 --> 01:04:17,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm it down a little bit.

877
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:19,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might like that.

878
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:22,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could do something like that where it'd be really cool and just

879
01:04:24,145 --> 01:04:40,757
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's unfortunately it's going to go the way like a lot of these Sony products do is where they just kind of like just forget about it and it goes off and then we're like you know several summer game fests down the road and we're like hey where's all those PlayStation VR 2 titles and then the next thing you know oh yeah we stopped supporting it.

880
01:04:41,487 --> 01:04:43,247
[SPEAKER_02]: What Vita, you know?

881
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:44,708
[SPEAKER_03]: One more comment in chat here.

882
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane says PSVR 2 already feels dead.

883
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:48,629
[SPEAKER_03]: They never talk about it.

884
01:04:48,629 --> 01:04:51,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know about things coming out for it because they don't talk about it.

885
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't follow every developer making games for it.

886
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:57,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So the games just go unnoticed since Sony ignores it.

887
01:04:57,551 --> 01:04:59,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch, but true.

888
01:04:59,212 --> 01:05:01,152
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

889
01:05:01,152 --> 01:05:03,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next story is about kind of an update.

890
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:06,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, just something we talked about two weeks ago on the show.

891
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:12,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the fact that, as we know, Charles Martinet will no longer be voicing Mario.

892
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,481
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a new voice actor in Mario Wonder.

893
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:15,962
[SPEAKER_03]: They are still not saying who that is.

894
01:05:15,962 --> 01:05:18,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we just get to find out when the credits roll in the game.

895
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:21,066
[SPEAKER_02]: What if it's the Final Fantasy 16 guy?

896
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:22,307
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

897
01:05:22,307 --> 01:05:22,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.

898
01:05:22,988 --> 01:05:27,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I, I understand why they kind of are keeping it under wraps, because

899
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:32,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That person is going to get bullied, unfortunately, and it sucks.

900
01:05:32,431 --> 01:05:33,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And they shouldn't.

901
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make it very clear that type of behavior online is fucked up.

902
01:05:37,294 --> 01:05:39,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately... What if they don't get?

903
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:41,298
[SPEAKER_03]: What if they're not?

904
01:05:41,298 --> 01:05:42,238
[SPEAKER_03]: They will.

905
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,299
[SPEAKER_03]: You hang out on Twitter.

906
01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:46,242
[SPEAKER_03]: They're absolutely going to get bullied because they're not Charles Martinet.

907
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to.

908
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:55,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the environment created on Twitter by the person that runs Twitter only lends itself to hyper-focusing that environment and making it worse.

909
01:05:55,509 --> 01:05:56,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Who said they have to be on Twitter?

910
01:05:57,532 --> 01:05:57,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

911
01:06:15,052 --> 01:06:24,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think that there'll be those of us who are like, I'd say the true fan, but those who will be like, welcome to the family.

912
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:24,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

913
01:06:24,822 --> 01:06:27,124
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I am.

914
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:35,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather focus on, you know, I think that if the people who are like welcoming speak louder than the people who are haters, then that's going to make all the difference.

915
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:44,215
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very good point is that, you know, we can, you know, send some love to counteract all of that negativity that we know is coming.

916
01:06:44,215 --> 01:06:55,037
[SPEAKER_03]: The part I want to say with that, though, is that I don't think it's a good decision on Nintendo's part to make people wait until the credits because that information will get leaked as soon as those press coffees are out there.

917
01:06:55,037 --> 01:06:55,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Coffees?

918
01:06:55,618 --> 01:06:56,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Copies are out there.

919
01:06:56,418 --> 01:06:58,378
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what embargo you put on it.

920
01:06:58,378 --> 01:07:00,019
[SPEAKER_03]: That name will leak out.

921
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:05,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nintendo, my question to you is, do you want to control the narrative or do you want Twitter to control the narrative?

922
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,682
[SPEAKER_03]: because right now, out of Doug Bowser's mouth, I'm hearing, I want Twitter to control the narrative.

923
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:12,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a poor decision.

924
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:20,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do hope Nintendo will allow this new voice actor to be properly introduced before the game comes out.

925
01:07:20,264 --> 01:07:20,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's my thought.

926
01:07:20,945 --> 01:07:21,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway,

927
01:07:22,085 --> 01:07:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice video that they did do was that they actually did a video with Charles Martinet and Miyamoto.

928
01:07:29,475 --> 01:07:31,157
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't really new information in it.

929
01:07:31,157 --> 01:07:38,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just kind of talking about Charles Martinet's new role as the ambassador, and you kind of got to hear it out of his mouth where Charles Martinet was like,

930
01:07:38,566 --> 01:07:41,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm really happy to be doing this role.

931
01:07:41,147 --> 01:07:45,768
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an honor to be voicing Mario for years, but I'm so excited to come to conventions and meet all of you.

932
01:07:45,768 --> 01:07:46,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very nice thing.

933
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:52,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the kind of thing where I'm kind of surprised they didn't release that with the news two weeks ago.

934
01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:53,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But okay, it is what it is.

935
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:55,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming out now.

936
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I think it was very nice of Charles Martinet to be a good sport.

937
01:07:59,891 --> 01:08:01,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Because technically, he wasn't

938
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:07,233
[SPEAKER_03]: required to be, but I get that he wants to continue this good relationship with Nintendo.

939
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:16,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, you know, to be fair to Nintendo, they were treating him better than unfortunately, a lot of voice actors get treated in this industry.

940
01:08:16,315 --> 01:08:25,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was literally just looking at Jennifer Hale's Twitter the other day, and she just casually said, Oh, yeah, I got replaced on this cartoon I was on because they didn't want to pay union rates anymore.

941
01:08:26,555 --> 01:08:35,946
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, and that's, you know, that's how I found out when the new season got announced with the with the new voice actors, you know, and so a lot of voice actors are not treated very kindly in this industry.

942
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:40,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will give credit to Nintendo that like they, they, they made a decision.

943
01:08:40,651 --> 01:08:42,073
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sticking to it.

944
01:08:42,073 --> 01:08:44,375
[SPEAKER_03]: They're handling it with grace best they can.

945
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will give them all of that.

946
01:08:47,138 --> 01:08:53,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said two weeks ago, if you really want to show Charles Martinet how much you love him, pay him for an autograph when he comes to your town.

947
01:08:53,783 --> 01:08:56,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay him for an autograph and a selfie when he comes to your town.

948
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:58,347
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the best way to express your love.

949
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:02,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

950
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:03,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

951
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:04,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally spies.

952
01:09:04,712 --> 01:09:05,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ranma.

953
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:07,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate that.

954
01:09:07,715 --> 01:09:09,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on.

955
01:09:09,736 --> 01:09:11,117
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some more news.

956
01:09:11,117 --> 01:09:11,618
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura,

957
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:18,783
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go, now my unmute button is working.

958
01:09:18,783 --> 01:09:23,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I heard you.

959
01:09:23,146 --> 01:09:34,715
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is a, I mean, honestly, I'm not surprised by it because it's Nintendo, but they have said that there are no plans for any DLC.

960
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:39,278
[SPEAKER_00]: for Tears of the Kingdom.

961
01:09:39,278 --> 01:09:44,521
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they hardly had DLC for Breath of the Wild, so I wasn't expecting anything.

962
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:51,406
[SPEAKER_00]: I always expect Nintendo to bring out, you know, if they're doing a game, they're going to do a whole game.

963
01:09:51,406 --> 01:09:52,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Breath of the Wild had DLC.

964
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:53,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm?

965
01:09:53,947 --> 01:09:54,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Breath of the Wild had DLC.

966
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:57,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it had, it barely had DLC.

967
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:57,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're right.

968
01:09:57,549 --> 01:09:58,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

969
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:58,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely.

970
01:09:59,773 --> 01:10:03,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just found a piece of string cheese that's been on my desk since last night.

971
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.

972
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,580
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some DLC right there.

973
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,764
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unopened string cheese, but anyway, back to this.

974
01:10:10,764 --> 01:10:20,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, and this is the quote from Alnuma, there are no plans to release additional content this time because I feel like I've done everything I can to create games in that world.

975
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:30,758
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first place, the reason why we chose this time as a sequel to the previous game is because we thought there would be value and experience in a new kind of play in that place in Hyrule.

976
01:10:30,758 --> 01:10:35,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, if such a reason is newly born, it may return to the same world again.

977
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,701
[SPEAKER_00]: This is translation, clearly.

978
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:43,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play, so I'd be happy if you could look forward to it.

979
01:10:44,803 --> 01:10:56,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Translation is, we don't want to provide you with more items to build things out of because you've already made so many pornographic things already that we're afraid.

980
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

981
01:10:57,431 --> 01:11:06,117
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just think that, you know, when Nintendo puts out a game, a first party game, you know,

982
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:16,737
[SPEAKER_00]: they tend to put out a fairly complete project that fulfills the goal they set out as far as storytelling and experience.

983
01:11:16,737 --> 01:11:22,500
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know, I've never expected DLC with first-party Nintendo games.

984
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:29,464
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, when the stuff came out for Breath of the Wild, I was pretty surprised, honestly.

985
01:11:29,464 --> 01:11:30,145
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so...

986
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:39,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not something like Splatoon that would be something that's a continuous, ongoing, non-singular story.

987
01:11:39,973 --> 01:11:46,759
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is its own entity, and honestly, I have no problem with this.

988
01:11:46,759 --> 01:11:49,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people, y'all ain't entitled to extra shit, y'all.

989
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:55,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually would love to see DLC on older games, like older games, like the original Zelda.

990
01:11:55,695 --> 01:12:00,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give me a third and fourth quest or, you know, like new characters.

991
01:12:00,878 --> 01:12:03,500
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the fan community is already taking care of that.

992
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I get that.

993
01:12:05,301 --> 01:12:05,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.

994
01:12:05,902 --> 01:12:07,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, it would still be cool.

995
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they do the like save state things, which is fine, but like it would be really cool like to just, OK, let's do these things that we can push, you know,

996
01:12:14,908 --> 01:12:19,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't have done on the Nintendo because we didn't have the memory space but now we can push it to whatever we want.

997
01:12:19,953 --> 01:12:22,074
[SPEAKER_03]: ELC for Animal Crossing for GameCube.

998
01:12:22,074 --> 01:12:24,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario 35 is what I'm hearing.

999
01:12:24,597 --> 01:12:28,160
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that technically is the old game with a new twist, right?

1000
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So which I don't know why it was limited time.

1001
01:12:30,422 --> 01:12:37,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, there's rumors rumors that FF0 is going to get a 99 game.

1002
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be interesting.

1003
01:12:38,749 --> 01:12:38,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1004
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:46,076
[SPEAKER_03]: But I definitely agree with what Jamie said about Nintendo games.

1005
01:12:46,076 --> 01:12:46,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an accurate statement.

1006
01:12:46,856 --> 01:12:49,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo games are pretty fully featured.

1007
01:12:49,017 --> 01:12:53,598
[SPEAKER_03]: We think of Nintendo as a company that releases relatively bug-free.

1008
01:12:53,598 --> 01:12:55,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't say 100% bug-free.

1009
01:12:55,078 --> 01:12:56,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Relatively.

1010
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:58,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, relatively, compared to some of their peers.

1011
01:12:58,219 --> 01:13:02,340
[SPEAKER_03]: They do very good with that and always doing a fully featured type of product.

1012
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:07,244
[SPEAKER_00]: If something's going to have that Nintendo seal of approval on it, it's going to have earned it.

1013
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:32,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like it's going to hurt the game in the long run because the game itself is fully, one of these days I'll get around to playing it, is fully featured.

1014
01:13:32,982 --> 01:13:35,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you're not going to be disappointed.

1015
01:13:35,002 --> 01:13:38,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because they're working on a Switch 2 anyway.

1016
01:13:38,003 --> 01:13:46,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at this point, like, you're not going to do it because the Switch 2 would be out by the time this DLC would, hypothetical DLC would come out anyway.

1017
01:13:46,225 --> 01:13:46,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're just moving on.

1018
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:49,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't stop them from releasing Breath of the Wild.

1019
01:13:49,785 --> 01:13:50,226
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's true.

1020
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:53,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Breath of the Wild ended up being a dual release.

1021
01:13:53,526 --> 01:13:55,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they could, you know,

1022
01:13:56,988 --> 01:14:07,274
[SPEAKER_02]: They may say that, yeah, we're not releasing DLC, but there could be a special edition that comes out that has more content in it.

1023
01:14:07,274 --> 01:14:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: That's technically not DLC and technically is the best type of being right.

1024
01:14:11,817 --> 01:14:17,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a hundred clip that we're going to be watching this in six months when that's true.

1025
01:14:17,061 --> 01:14:18,342
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

1026
01:14:18,342 --> 01:14:19,222
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why there's no DLC.

1027
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:21,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1028
01:14:52,167 --> 01:15:01,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there's rumors that last month during Gamescom that developers were shown a Switch 2 behind closed doors.

1029
01:15:01,194 --> 01:15:04,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, basically, allegedly, yes.

1030
01:15:04,176 --> 01:15:10,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Eurogamer had said that partners were shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run.

1031
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And is, um, there is one such demo was a souped up version of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

1032
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:19,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironic.

1033
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:24,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironic that they would be doing that.

1034
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:31,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of rumors regarding specs and stuff that I've seen too, but I don't want to speculate in specs.

1035
01:15:31,795 --> 01:15:34,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray tracing and DLSS and all that stuff like that.

1036
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:39,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what they come out with when they announce it, which will happen eventually.

1037
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,154
[SPEAKER_02]: After the holiday.

1038
01:15:41,154 --> 01:15:43,478
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to cannibalize holiday sales.

1039
01:15:43,478 --> 01:15:45,401
[SPEAKER_03]: No way, if anything, about this business.

1040
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:47,123
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not holiday for sure.

1041
01:15:47,123 --> 01:15:50,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, next year, maybe.

1042
01:15:50,388 --> 01:15:52,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Next holiday, possibly.

1043
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:55,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean... We'll see.

1044
01:15:55,576 --> 01:15:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1045
01:15:57,313 --> 01:16:00,215
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1046
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:16,307
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

1047
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:55,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the specs are still being negotiated and they might have shown the higher end of things but I don't think that necessarily means it's the final product.

1048
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:58,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there's a lot of that stuff still to be figured out.

1049
01:16:59,653 --> 01:17:07,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, another thing that kind of dates back to Gamescom a little bit, but this was this Pikmin Finder AR game that came out.

1050
01:17:07,837 --> 01:17:13,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Pikmin Bloom, and it's not Pokemon Go, but it's another Nintendo and Niantic partnership.

1051
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pikmin Finder.

1052
01:17:15,361 --> 01:17:20,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an AR game that lets you scan the environment for Pikmin and treasures.

1053
01:17:20,263 --> 01:17:23,125
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little link, it's pikmin-finder.nintendo.net.

1054
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:27,547
[SPEAKER_03]: and you go on it on your mobile device, you do a little QR code.

1055
01:17:27,547 --> 01:17:30,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's how you get it all started.

1056
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:36,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, honestly, I haven't really played around with this because it's just a way to just scan the environment.

1057
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:41,077
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to like scam people into like doing more 3D scans of locations and stuff like that.

1058
01:17:41,217 --> 01:17:49,705
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but Niantic also already has a game like this called Peridot that they put out and I played Peridot for about a week.

1059
01:17:49,705 --> 01:17:51,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And because there's there's no game there.

1060
01:17:51,927 --> 01:17:56,352
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things that's like, Oh, that's interesting for about three days.

1061
01:17:56,352 --> 01:17:58,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're like, Okay, I've seen it all done.

1062
01:17:58,614 --> 01:18:02,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And the the monetization in that game is horrific.

1063
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:04,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrific.

1064
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:27,811
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for those of you that didn't think I meant it when I said that a few weeks ago, I no longer have a subscription to Ingress Core or whatever, whatever the thing is, it's gone.

1065
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:34,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So but I am for fit because I recognize that I like to gamify my fitness.

1066
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:38,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I do still play Pokemon Go and I play Pikmin Bloom.

1067
01:18:38,015 --> 01:18:41,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't given any of those games a red cent since

1068
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:45,482
[SPEAKER_03]: the incident happened where I reported a cheater and nothing was done about it.

1069
01:18:45,482 --> 01:18:46,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm over it.

1070
01:18:46,563 --> 01:18:53,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I'm not supporting this system that is weakly and that does not have enforcement behind it.

1071
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:55,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway,

1072
01:18:56,265 --> 01:19:02,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and as far as this demo goes, I mean, I'm sure it's cute, but it's probably cute for five minutes.

1073
01:19:02,207 --> 01:19:09,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've already seen that Niantic has been pushing this technology for quite some time now between Peridot and some of these other things.

1074
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:15,472
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to show how you can actually make a fun game out of it, because Peridot isn't it.

1075
01:19:15,472 --> 01:19:17,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So show us.

1076
01:19:17,513 --> 01:19:18,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to just be very blunt.

1077
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:21,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Show us the fucking point.

1078
01:19:21,414 --> 01:19:23,175
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, like, I don't know.

1079
01:19:24,138 --> 01:19:25,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a Nintendo game.

1080
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:28,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still love them to see something like, uh, Elebits.

1081
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:30,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Elebits?

1082
01:19:30,023 --> 01:19:32,966
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a fun game from Konami.

1083
01:19:32,966 --> 01:19:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they should do something like that.

1084
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:35,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that would be cool.

1085
01:19:35,428 --> 01:19:37,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess that's almost like Pikmin.

1086
01:19:37,089 --> 01:19:41,574
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, finding stuff hidden in your environment, but... Yeah, I don't know.

1087
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Niantic is kind of... out of ideas, I guess.

1088
01:19:45,837 --> 01:19:48,380
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to license and make shells of, like, games.

1089
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:50,567
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some gameplay to them.

1090
01:19:50,567 --> 01:19:53,928
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it's basically monetization machines.

1091
01:19:53,928 --> 01:19:57,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I, and I've said this before, and I'm going to be very careful not to repeat myself.

1092
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:03,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, is that they are married to their mission statement more than they're married to their player base.

1093
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,652
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a problem.

1094
01:20:05,652 --> 01:20:10,353
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why that's happening is because the individual running the company is he is a smart guy.

1095
01:20:10,353 --> 01:20:11,613
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a brilliant mind.

1096
01:20:11,613 --> 01:20:13,414
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the guy behind Google Maps.

1097
01:20:13,414 --> 01:20:15,654
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done a lot of very smart things.

1098
01:20:15,654 --> 01:20:17,715
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what he hasn't done run a game company.

1099
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:20,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other problem.

1100
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:20,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you?

1101
01:20:20,993 --> 01:20:23,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a game company?

1102
01:20:23,254 --> 01:20:26,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you a get out and explore the world company?

1103
01:20:26,616 --> 01:20:33,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's starting to show that being both of those things is very, very difficult.

1104
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:41,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So get the help you need, or admit that you're not a game company because you're not running it like one.

1105
01:20:41,046 --> 01:20:43,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on to our next story.

1106
01:20:43,507 --> 01:20:44,148
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

1107
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:52,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, there's finally a specific home port of a game, but not quite how you think it's gonna be.

1108
01:20:52,150 --> 01:21:02,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Daytona USA 2 is finally coming home, but it's because it's built into, uh, Like a Dragon Gaiden, uh, the man who erased his name.

1109
01:21:05,756 --> 01:21:10,721
[SPEAKER_00]: The other game had some old Sega titles in it.

1110
01:21:10,721 --> 01:21:19,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is Daytona USA 2, but it's going to be under the non-licensed name Sega Racing Classic 2.

1111
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:30,699
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also in the game is going to be Fighting Vipers 2 and some Master System ports of Flicky and Galaxy Force.

1112
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:35,423
[SPEAKER_00]: The game will be out on November 9th this year.

1113
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:39,326
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I would just like them to go.

1114
01:21:39,326 --> 01:21:42,249
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want more Sega Ages and bring something like that back out.

1115
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:48,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like, legit, the Yakuza Sega Arcade stuff is really cool.

1116
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:57,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I would love, like, a Sega Arcade that has, like, all of what they've done throughout that series, like, in one package, and I think they could sell that, and it would work.

1117
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:11,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so weird that like a modern AAA game nowadays can put, you know, older games that they published into the game and not charge people extra for that, Nintendo.

1118
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:15,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega does what Nintendo don't.

1119
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:16,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come back.

1120
01:22:16,535 --> 01:22:21,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1121
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

1122
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:36,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the real question, and I bet Bobby would want to know the answer to this, DarkSakura, with this getting the home port and everything, is this how you might play Yakuza?

1123
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I ever say I wasn't gonna play it?

1124
01:22:38,698 --> 01:22:40,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

1125
01:22:40,619 --> 01:22:45,582
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm on a Mac.

1126
01:22:45,582 --> 01:22:46,703
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way for me to play it.

1127
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:54,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, because I, I feel like like a dragon was I could be wrong was on state, but it's cloud gaming is probably the way to do it.

1128
01:22:54,372 --> 01:22:58,194
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it came out after Stadia shut down.

1129
01:22:58,194 --> 01:23:01,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it might be on GeForce now.

1130
01:23:01,956 --> 01:23:03,377
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.

1131
01:23:03,377 --> 01:23:09,561
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, I never said I was never gonna play it.

1132
01:23:09,561 --> 01:23:13,163
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Halo I won't play.

1133
01:23:13,163 --> 01:23:14,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw Halo.

1134
01:23:14,884 --> 01:23:16,164
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1135
01:23:16,164 --> 01:23:17,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Next story, Loki.

1136
01:23:18,379 --> 01:23:27,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently the announcement is that Nitara is back and being played by Megan Fox.

1137
01:23:27,464 --> 01:23:32,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's not only going to be doing the voice for the character, but also doing the mocap for it as well, which is pretty cool.

1138
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:38,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, she, of course, in the reveal trailer said, you know, she comes from this weird realm.

1139
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:40,314
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the type of vampire creature.

1140
01:23:40,314 --> 01:23:41,774
[SPEAKER_02]: She's evil, but she's also good.

1141
01:23:41,774 --> 01:23:43,675
[SPEAKER_02]: She's trying to save her people.

1142
01:23:43,675 --> 01:23:44,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like her.

1143
01:23:44,615 --> 01:23:49,177
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a vampire, which obviously resonates for whatever reason.

1144
01:23:49,177 --> 01:23:50,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because you're a vampire?

1145
01:23:50,498 --> 01:23:55,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Megan Fox, are you a vampire?

1146
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,980
[SPEAKER_02]: She also said that I'm not really voicing it.

1147
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,642
[SPEAKER_02]: She's kind of me.

1148
01:24:00,642 --> 01:24:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of funny.

1149
01:24:02,048 --> 01:24:03,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she's a vampire.

1150
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:04,269
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a vampire.

1151
01:24:04,269 --> 01:24:06,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Confirmed, Megan Fox, vampire.

1152
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Megan Fox is so goth, you all.

1153
01:24:09,971 --> 01:24:11,471
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so goth.

1154
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:12,992
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it's cool.

1155
01:24:12,992 --> 01:24:14,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's whatever.

1156
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you watch the trailer for it?

1157
01:24:16,233 --> 01:24:18,234
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually playing it on B-roll right now.

1158
01:24:18,234 --> 01:24:21,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, no, I mean, I mean, but like, hear her voice.

1159
01:24:21,435 --> 01:24:22,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I'm poking.

1160
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:23,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm poking fun at it.

1161
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,196
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I do think it's cool.

1162
01:24:25,196 --> 01:24:26,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it is a good job.

1163
01:24:26,497 --> 01:24:26,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1164
01:24:27,222 --> 01:24:35,425
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and I like that like, you know, Hollywood or like, you know, classic Hollywood or whatever you want to call it is crossing over more and more into games like this.

1165
01:24:35,425 --> 01:24:41,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, we all remember a day when games were like, you wouldn't see trip.

1166
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:49,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if Megan Fox is triple A, but she's probably at least a, you know, A list movie stars participating in things like this.

1167
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:52,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto or something.

1168
01:24:52,331 --> 01:24:53,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very commonplace.

1169
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:54,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's cool.

1170
01:24:55,242 --> 01:24:59,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you also see, though, what the other thing coming out for Mortal Kombat 1 is?

1171
01:24:59,424 --> 01:25:01,745
[SPEAKER_00]: The other skin for Johnny Cage?

1172
01:25:01,745 --> 01:25:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, it's Van Damme.

1173
01:25:03,746 --> 01:25:05,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1174
01:25:05,027 --> 01:25:07,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is.

1175
01:25:07,028 --> 01:25:09,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is him doing the voicing, I think.

1176
01:25:09,849 --> 01:25:11,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1177
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:15,792
[SPEAKER_00]: He was supposed to originally have been the character that Johnny Cage became.

1178
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:16,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1179
01:25:16,432 --> 01:25:17,653
[SPEAKER_03]: How full circle is that?

1180
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:20,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I completely forgot that Jean-Claude Van Damme was doing that.

1181
01:25:20,994 --> 01:25:22,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1182
01:25:22,095 --> 01:25:22,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1183
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:23,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really cool.

1184
01:25:23,709 --> 01:25:28,076
[SPEAKER_00]: There's honestly some pretty good talent involved in that game.

1185
01:25:28,076 --> 01:25:28,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1186
01:25:28,817 --> 01:25:32,022
[SPEAKER_02]: We finally got our Street Fighter X Mortal Kombat now.

1187
01:25:33,643 --> 01:25:36,745
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not how we thought, but you know, how fun.

1188
01:25:36,745 --> 01:25:38,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that means somebody could do that in Mugen.

1189
01:25:38,746 --> 01:25:44,409
[SPEAKER_03]: They could take Guile versus Johnny Cage, both Jean-Claude Van Damme.

1190
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:45,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could finally see that.

1191
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:45,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1192
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,431
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's coming.

1193
01:25:47,431 --> 01:25:49,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see a lot of comments in chat lighting up about this.

1194
01:25:49,973 --> 01:25:52,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Crystal Skies in chat says, I mean, J.K.

1195
01:25:52,334 --> 01:25:55,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Simmons and Jason Isaacs in Baldur's Gate 3 is amazing.

1196
01:25:55,456 --> 01:25:56,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1197
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:57,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind.

1198
01:25:57,137 --> 01:25:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: J.K.

1199
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:59,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Simmons in anything is awesome.

1200
01:25:59,298 --> 01:26:06,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Isaacs was also in Marvel's Midnight Suns as Mephisto, and he was perfect.

1201
01:26:06,764 --> 01:26:13,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Also something to keep in mind with the strike going on right now, video games are something that celebrities can work with.

1202
01:26:13,929 --> 01:26:15,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The Screen Actors Guild can work with, at least for now.

1203
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:19,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I've heard about the whole voting in advance to authorize a strike.

1204
01:26:19,954 --> 01:26:21,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm well aware of that situation.

1205
01:26:21,735 --> 01:26:25,680
[SPEAKER_03]: But we haven't heard of a strike being authorized on the games industry yet.

1206
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So for now, you know, Screen Actors Guild still work there.

1207
01:26:28,423 --> 01:26:39,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if we're not going to see more of these types of collaborations, you know, in a year, a year and a half's time, because it allows the some of the actors to work could be very interesting.

1208
01:26:39,037 --> 01:26:39,657
[SPEAKER_03]: See what happens.

1209
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:50,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Questbuster in chat warns, in addition to the Mortal Kombat 1 story, the full story was already leaked and exists in clips out there, so watch out.

1210
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:53,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, that game is also out this coming week, I think.

1211
01:26:53,827 --> 01:26:54,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Very soon.

1212
01:26:54,287 --> 01:26:57,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you have the collector's edition, it's on the 15th.

1213
01:26:57,089 --> 01:26:59,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you gotta wait until next Tuesday.

1214
01:26:59,771 --> 01:27:02,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still not very long.

1215
01:27:02,073 --> 01:27:06,035
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very good at announcing those games, and then they're coming out like three months later.

1216
01:27:06,035 --> 01:27:07,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1217
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:08,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Elder Scrolls 6

1218
01:27:27,393 --> 01:27:32,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is evidence that went in with Microsoft's battle with the FTC.

1219
01:27:32,276 --> 01:27:43,024
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some vagueness about if this game would be Xbox only, because of course, they don't want the courts to think, you know, there's going to be antitrust problems or whatever.

1220
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:50,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So they say, with Elder Scrolls 6, it's so far out, it's hard to understand what the platforms will even be.

1221
01:27:50,469 --> 01:27:54,011
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about a game that's five plus years away.

1222
01:27:54,011 --> 01:27:54,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

1223
01:27:55,132 --> 01:28:03,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in an interview with Bloomberg this week, Phil Spencer was asked again about Elder Scrolls 6, saying, We look at it on a case by case basis with the games we build.

1224
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:10,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure our games are available in so many different places on our Xbox consoles, on PC, also via cloud.

1225
01:28:10,683 --> 01:28:13,685
[SPEAKER_03]: These games can come to almost any web enabled device.

1226
01:28:13,685 --> 01:28:19,389
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at millions and millions of players who will have access to Starfield and other Xbox Game Studios games.

1227
01:28:19,389 --> 01:28:24,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about giving players choice around how they want to play and build their library games.

1228
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:30,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, look, he answered it in that quote right there.

1229
01:28:30,751 --> 01:28:31,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the thing.

1230
01:28:31,571 --> 01:28:35,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand this doesn't generate clicks for your website and all that stuff.

1231
01:28:35,413 --> 01:28:37,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But really look at what he's saying.

1232
01:28:37,554 --> 01:28:43,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And he can't he can't say it so explicitly because there are still court things going on with Microsoft.

1233
01:28:43,698 --> 01:28:52,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, Microsoft says Microsoft Bethesda was settled a long time ago, but they're still trying to project this image of Oh, yeah, we were gonna put our games everywhere.

1234
01:28:52,943 --> 01:28:54,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision Blizzard come be a part of that.

1235
01:28:54,665 --> 01:28:58,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, they want to project that image to all these regulatory bodies around the world.

1236
01:28:58,128 --> 01:29:00,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So he can't be explicit yet.

1237
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:12,361
[SPEAKER_03]: If you read between the lines in that comment, he literally says, between Xbox on the between Xbox Cloud, Xbox system, and PC, we're gonna get this game everywhere.

1238
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:15,263
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need PlayStation 5.

1239
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:15,744
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1240
01:29:15,744 --> 01:29:16,865
[SPEAKER_03]: He's saying without saying.

1241
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:28,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and nor should the FTC be, like, suggesting that they need to put that game on a PlayStation console, because, like, I'm sorry, Sony, they're not publishing Spider-Man on Xbox.

1242
01:29:28,623 --> 01:29:30,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why the double standards here?

1243
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:33,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't even understand why they would push that.

1244
01:29:33,104 --> 01:29:43,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that somebody in the FTC is just not clear enough to realize that, like, a Bethesda game is not an Activision game, and it's completely two different scenarios here, but...

1245
01:29:44,347 --> 01:29:48,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a stupid thing to even inquire about.

1246
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:51,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

1247
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:57,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Elder Scrolls VI is exclusive to Microsoft, I guarantee it.

1248
01:29:57,673 --> 01:30:00,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why we're continuing to debate this.

1249
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:03,870
[SPEAKER_03]: look at what they're saying.

1250
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:08,692
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be exclusive 100% especially the way he compares it to Starfield.

1251
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:16,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Starfield just went through this exact same speculation and questions and talk arounds and all this stuff.

1252
01:30:16,475 --> 01:30:17,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened?

1253
01:30:17,535 --> 01:30:19,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exclusive.

1254
01:30:19,016 --> 01:30:21,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Elder Scrolls six will be and and and that's okay.

1255
01:30:21,977 --> 01:30:30,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft is buying these big companies so they can have exclusives to take on Sony's what Sony's got and refuses to put out on all of their devices.

1256
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another interesting thing.

1257
01:30:33,283 --> 01:30:34,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nevermind.

1258
01:30:34,325 --> 01:30:35,807
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll, we'll go to that another day.

1259
01:30:35,807 --> 01:30:36,509
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1260
01:30:36,509 --> 01:30:37,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, moving on.

1261
01:30:37,511 --> 01:30:44,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's, let's go back to a more classic time in this next segment, as we usually do.

1262
01:30:54,972 --> 01:31:02,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1263
01:31:02,737 --> 01:31:06,139
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1264
01:31:06,139 --> 01:31:11,142
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, but DarkSakura, you have a classic non-game tonight, if I remember right.

1265
01:31:11,142 --> 01:31:14,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you pick for us tonight?

1266
01:31:14,885 --> 01:31:21,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked Connect Four, another game that has made enemies of entire families.

1267
01:31:22,828 --> 01:31:38,921
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is gone by other names, not just Connect4 with the number 4 or spelled out 4, but 4UP, Plot4, Find4, Captain's Mistress, 4inarow, Drop4, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union.

1268
01:31:38,921 --> 01:31:41,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only going to call it Captain's Mistress from now on.

1269
01:31:42,245 --> 01:31:44,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of down for that.

1270
01:31:44,888 --> 01:31:58,082
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, you have two colors and your goal is to make four in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

1271
01:32:03,396 --> 01:32:15,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's already what's referred to as a solved game, meaning that it's one that you can predict as long as people play perfectly.

1272
01:32:15,299 --> 01:32:30,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing about this one is that the official Kinect 4 trademark came out in February 1974 by Milton Bradley, but the theories behind the game have already existed well before that.

1273
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:42,699
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if anyone remembers the pretty sneaky cis commercial, because they redid that commercial a couple of times in the history of that game.

1274
01:32:42,699 --> 01:32:48,501
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it said in that commercial, connect four of your checkers in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

1275
01:32:48,501 --> 01:32:53,882
[SPEAKER_00]: But look out, your opponent can sneak up on you and win the game.

1276
01:32:53,882 --> 01:33:01,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually has a lot more to go with a little bit of a mathematical

1277
01:33:05,364 --> 01:33:10,933
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's referred to as a zero-sum game.

1278
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:26,134
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two sides, but one is strictly advantaged and one is strictly disadvantaged.

1279
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:42,764
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but the first time the game was ever solved, like completely, was, uh, by James Dal Allen on October 1st, 1988, and then independently by Victor Alice on October 16th, 1988.

1280
01:33:42,764 --> 01:33:49,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically was by developing strategy to mathematically figure out where

1281
01:33:49,902 --> 01:33:51,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

1282
01:34:00,145 --> 01:34:13,095
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually, they've even had AI applied to it to figure out all the various different formulas that could be used to decide optimal gameplay.

1283
01:34:13,095 --> 01:34:18,339
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest thing with the Kinect 4 is that, honestly, the first one who does it first is the winner.

1284
01:34:18,339 --> 01:34:28,307
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who makes it... We used to play, like, not the first person to get the 4, but how many could you get out of the board?

1285
01:34:29,521 --> 01:34:32,387
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it was it was pretty, pretty interesting.

1286
01:34:32,387 --> 01:34:36,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like how many four connections could you get once all the pieces were played?

1287
01:34:36,775 --> 01:34:37,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1288
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:38,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's an interesting little house rule.

1289
01:34:38,759 --> 01:34:39,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1290
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:49,234
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are other variations of the game that have different board sizes and game pieces and rules and stuff like that.

1291
01:34:49,234 --> 01:35:00,960
[SPEAKER_00]: The variations are really good for, again, folks who use AI for projections and game theorists.

1292
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:07,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the most common board is 7 columns by 6 rows.

1293
01:35:07,641 --> 01:35:16,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Variations can be 5 by 4, 6 by 5, 8 by 7, 9 by 7, 10 by 7, 8 by 8, and infinite connect 4.

1294
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:23,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cylinder infinite connect 4, which I haven't seen either of those.

1295
01:35:23,405 --> 01:35:23,705
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

1296
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:31,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, though, you're pretty much going, you know, just drop it in, see what happens.

1297
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:36,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are other variations, like I was saying.

1298
01:35:36,502 --> 01:35:53,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop out starts traditionally the same way, but you alternate your pieces, everyone takes their turn, but during each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top, or if one has any discs of their own color on the bottom row, they can pop out.

1299
01:35:54,405 --> 01:35:56,586
[SPEAKER_00]: that disc instead.

1300
01:35:56,586 --> 01:36:02,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it drops down everything from above it, you know, kind of like clearing out a Tetris line.

1301
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:14,032
[SPEAKER_00]: They also pop ten, which you set up your discs into the slot, filling up from only the bottom row and then moving on until the next row is filled.

1302
01:36:14,032 --> 01:36:16,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're you're doing your four like that.

1303
01:36:16,853 --> 01:36:21,695
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also five in a row, of course, played on a six by nine grid.

1304
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:25,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Power Up, which is

1305
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:34,860
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a power checkers piece where you can choose to play it once per game and it has an anvil icon.

1306
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:40,323
[SPEAKER_00]: If you play one with an anvil icon, you have to pop out all the pieces below it.

1307
01:36:40,323 --> 01:36:43,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Just different variations like that.

1308
01:36:43,365 --> 01:36:51,690
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as other versions of the game, there's a giant Kinect 4 and we actually see someone who has constructed one.

1309
01:36:54,552 --> 01:36:59,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the largest version.

1310
01:36:59,094 --> 01:37:05,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It has made from weather-resistant wood and measures 120 cm in both width and height.

1311
01:37:05,797 --> 01:37:12,460
[SPEAKER_00]: It was released for the Microvision video game console in 1997, developed by Robert Hoffberg.

1312
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:16,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also released on the TI-99-4 computer.

1313
01:37:16,401 --> 01:37:17,222
[SPEAKER_00]: I have played that one.

1314
01:37:18,623 --> 01:37:20,605
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1979, of course.

1315
01:37:20,605 --> 01:37:24,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit older when I played it.

1316
01:37:24,649 --> 01:37:29,774
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, I mean, one of the fun things about it is that you can just play a very quick game.

1317
01:37:29,774 --> 01:37:31,836
[SPEAKER_00]: There's travel versions of it.

1318
01:37:31,836 --> 01:37:37,381
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another one they made in 2007 called Connect Four Stackers, which instead of the grid,

1319
01:37:38,822 --> 01:37:44,505
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a board that you're placing your discs on.

1320
01:37:44,505 --> 01:37:55,090
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a physical game called Kinect 4x4 where it has two layer vertical grid with colored discs for four players plus blocking discs.

1321
01:37:57,012 --> 01:38:04,967
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, Baytek Games released a Kinect for Ticket Redemption arcade game under license by Hasbro.

1322
01:38:04,967 --> 01:38:08,013
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, Winning Moves published Kinect for Twist and Turn.

1323
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:15,266
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have a game tower instead of a grid and it has five rings that twist independently.

1324
01:38:15,266 --> 01:38:16,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds complicated.

1325
01:38:16,747 --> 01:38:26,477
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Baytech Games in 2018 released a Connect 4 arcade game called Connect 4 Hoops where you throw basketballs and then they show up as checkers on the screen.

1326
01:38:27,615 --> 01:38:32,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so moving, uh, a little bit, a little bit past that.

1327
01:38:32,617 --> 01:38:34,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, oh, actually I take that back.

1328
01:38:34,978 --> 01:38:45,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was Connect Four Shots released by Hasbro in 2018, where you have to bounce the colored balls onto a grid until you achieve four in a row.

1329
01:38:45,522 --> 01:38:55,065
[SPEAKER_00]: So to go into some pop culture stuff, um, uh, Stuart McHoney, while working with NME, uh, started a rumor that Connect Four was invented by David Bowie.

1330
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:57,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

1331
01:38:57,191 --> 01:39:04,833
[SPEAKER_00]: On The Hub's show, Friday Game Night, there is a game called Connect 4 Basketball.

1332
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:06,694
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use basketballs to play.

1333
01:39:06,694 --> 01:39:17,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo did a version of this called 4 in a Row for their Tabletop Games compilation and Clubhouse Games 51 Worldwide Classics for the Switch.

1334
01:39:17,057 --> 01:39:23,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a game, A Way Out, you can play Connect 4 as a minigame.

1335
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:24,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.

1336
01:39:25,518 --> 01:39:30,642
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, your classic non-video game of the month, Kinect 4.

1337
01:39:30,642 --> 01:39:32,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Great choice.

1338
01:39:32,723 --> 01:39:34,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever played?

1339
01:39:34,644 --> 01:39:36,045
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

1340
01:39:36,045 --> 01:39:38,547
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, can you guess anything that's next?

1341
01:39:38,547 --> 01:39:40,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to hazard a guess?

1342
01:39:40,328 --> 01:39:43,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I've shown you the list, but no, I don't think I've seen the list.

1343
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have not.

1344
01:39:45,311 --> 01:39:45,772
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1345
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:46,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1346
01:39:49,994 --> 01:39:51,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever could be happening?

1347
01:39:51,455 --> 01:39:52,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever could it be?

1348
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:53,557
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out.

1349
01:39:53,557 --> 01:39:55,018
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out soon.

1350
01:39:55,018 --> 01:39:57,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a couple things, Jamie, I lost your avatar.

1351
01:39:57,941 --> 01:40:01,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's because I was running b roll or something, but I'm getting the squares on discord.

1352
01:40:01,544 --> 01:40:02,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what what's going on.

1353
01:40:02,645 --> 01:40:04,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1354
01:40:04,066 --> 01:40:05,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the other thing I was gonna say?

1355
01:40:05,908 --> 01:40:11,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, have you the last time I played connect for was actually have you ever played the one they have the bolt?

1356
01:40:13,103 --> 01:40:23,151
[SPEAKER_03]: which for those not from this town is kind of the local daddy bar, I guess, but it's pretty welcoming to all walks of life.

1357
01:40:23,151 --> 01:40:28,956
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have one of those giant Kinect 4s.

1358
01:40:28,956 --> 01:40:35,401
[SPEAKER_03]: That and the Jenga always makes a big thud when the game's over because they have one of those life-size Jengas out there too.

1359
01:40:35,401 --> 01:40:38,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're always making gigantic noise when they fall apart.

1360
01:40:41,845 --> 01:40:42,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

1361
01:40:42,947 --> 01:40:50,983
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what's going on with this thing because I have it set to not put this stupid little camo thing on my window and it still does it.

1362
01:40:52,602 --> 01:40:58,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, during that segment, somebody in chat reminded me of a big headline that we didn't have on our list tonight.

1363
01:40:58,664 --> 01:41:01,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you won't mind me adding something here on the fly.

1364
01:41:01,185 --> 01:41:02,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this is worth bringing up.

1365
01:41:02,606 --> 01:41:08,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the announcement that ReadPop and the ESA have broken up.

1366
01:41:08,348 --> 01:41:11,269
[SPEAKER_03]: They will not be, yeah, ReadPop and the ESA have broken up.

1367
01:41:11,269 --> 01:41:13,890
[SPEAKER_03]: They will not be working on E3 next year.

1368
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:14,550
[SPEAKER_03]: E3.

1369
01:41:36,502 --> 01:41:47,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I am actually legitimately surprised by this news because I thought for sure this was just, oh, ReadPop's just going to produce E3 as a fan convention like PAX or have E3 at PAX.

1370
01:41:47,687 --> 01:41:52,008
[SPEAKER_03]: But even that has apparently fallen apart for whatever reason.

1371
01:41:52,008 --> 01:42:02,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if the ESA is really hardheaded and that they really think they're going to get a show at the LA Convention Center again.

1372
01:42:02,473 --> 01:42:02,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I am

1373
01:42:04,328 --> 01:42:08,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Left to not be sure what else could be the possibility.

1374
01:42:08,189 --> 01:42:17,652
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESA has said in a statement, we appreciate ReebPop's partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events.

1375
01:42:17,652 --> 01:42:23,053
[SPEAKER_03]: While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry.

1376
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:25,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let the crickets chirp for that one.

1377
01:42:25,154 --> 01:42:32,996
[SPEAKER_03]: We are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event from format to location.

1378
01:42:33,743 --> 01:42:37,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, we're going to get into physical magazine publication.

1379
01:42:37,306 --> 01:42:41,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a winning strategy from format to location.

1380
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:43,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So E3 is going to be moving from the L.A.

1381
01:42:43,933 --> 01:42:47,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Convention Center to the banquet room at Applebee's.

1382
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:58,907
[SPEAKER_03]: We are committed to our role as a convenor, convenor for the industry, convenor, and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.

1383
01:42:58,907 --> 01:42:59,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1384
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:04,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

1385
01:43:04,561 --> 01:43:06,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just curious about something when bringing this whole thing up.

1386
01:43:06,903 --> 01:43:08,824
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me actually I just wanted to check out.

1387
01:43:08,824 --> 01:43:10,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm doing this live.

1388
01:43:10,826 --> 01:43:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what to expect here.

1389
01:43:13,888 --> 01:43:23,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually looking at the ESA's website right now because I'm just kind of curious, like, what are some things that the ESA has done for the industry?

1390
01:43:23,655 --> 01:43:24,836
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, here we go.

1391
01:43:24,836 --> 01:43:25,376
[SPEAKER_03]: In the news.

1392
01:43:26,197 --> 01:43:30,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Back on August 23rd, Essential Facts Key Findings.

1393
01:43:30,278 --> 01:43:31,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so they did a study.

1394
01:43:31,699 --> 01:43:33,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's something neat.

1395
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:43,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we go back over a month before that for their last big headline, July 20th, Gaming for Everyone, Creating an Inclusive Environment for a Global Player Community.

1396
01:43:43,422 --> 01:43:44,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, I agree with that.

1397
01:43:44,563 --> 01:43:45,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Games are for everyone.

1398
01:43:45,703 --> 01:43:47,543
[SPEAKER_03]: But how did the ESA do that?

1399
01:43:47,543 --> 01:43:48,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1400
01:43:48,364 --> 01:43:52,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They gathered with experts, innovators, and changemakers in New York's

1401
01:43:52,785 --> 01:43:54,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Games for Change Festival.

1402
01:43:54,566 --> 01:43:55,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So the ESA didn't put it on.

1403
01:43:55,967 --> 01:43:57,007
[SPEAKER_03]: They went somewhere else.

1404
01:43:57,007 --> 01:44:00,989
[SPEAKER_03]: They showed up.

1405
01:44:00,989 --> 01:44:03,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing up is really like the most important step, right?

1406
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:08,855
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESA is dead.

1407
01:44:08,855 --> 01:44:09,896
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't know it yet.

1408
01:44:09,896 --> 01:44:10,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell them.

1409
01:44:10,936 --> 01:44:12,938
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

1410
01:44:12,938 --> 01:44:19,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some other news that happened this week rapidly in our industry with rapid fire news.

1411
01:44:19,421 --> 01:44:22,943
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you some more headlines faster than the ESA will.

1412
01:44:22,943 --> 01:44:23,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll start with you.

1413
01:44:24,862 --> 01:44:27,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so I am very excited about this.

1414
01:44:27,804 --> 01:44:31,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It is another thing that you can get to build a console.

1415
01:44:31,906 --> 01:44:42,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not necessarily coming from LEGO this time, but it's Mega Bloks or... I think it... I don't know if it's Mega Bloks or Mega Construx, because they used to have the Construx license as well.

1416
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:45,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mega Blok, I guess, maybe they went back to that.

1417
01:44:45,814 --> 01:44:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a 3 to 4... or 3 4th scale replica of the Xbox 360.

1418
01:44:51,888 --> 01:44:54,570
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is a hundred and fifty dollars.

1419
01:44:54,570 --> 01:45:05,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fourteen hundred pieces and it includes the Xbox 360 console, the controller and a replica of Halo 3, the case and everything.

1420
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:08,762
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that bothers me the most about this is the internals.

1421
01:45:08,762 --> 01:45:13,866
[SPEAKER_02]: They do show that there's like actual circuit boards and stuff on the inside.

1422
01:45:13,866 --> 01:45:15,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does not look like an Xbox 360.

1423
01:45:15,808 --> 01:45:19,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I have taken apart so many of those.

1424
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:21,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they kind of

1425
01:45:22,433 --> 01:45:24,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Close-ish.

1426
01:45:24,896 --> 01:45:28,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's imaginative.

1427
01:45:28,179 --> 01:45:29,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You tried, you tried.

1428
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:38,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they put some things in there, and they're like, yeah, I think a circuit board goes here, like, you know, heatsink goes here, some resistors go here, yeah, close enough.

1429
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:42,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it still looks cool.

1430
01:45:42,853 --> 01:45:45,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what everyone hates on Mega Bloks.

1431
01:45:45,175 --> 01:45:48,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they've got some pretty good Pokemon builds.

1432
01:45:48,878 --> 01:45:54,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done their, like, giant Pikachu thing that they did, and that was pretty sweet.

1433
01:45:54,062 --> 01:45:59,607
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it'll be out in October on the 8th, and they had pre-orders for it.

1434
01:45:59,607 --> 01:46:04,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exclusively at Target, and it's sold out already.

1435
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:07,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm in Target all the time, so I will just have to keep an eye out.

1436
01:46:07,907 --> 01:46:12,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I have no room for this whatsoever.

1437
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:16,052
[SPEAKER_03]: We can just add that to the queue of unbuilt crap in our house.

1438
01:46:16,052 --> 01:46:24,478
[SPEAKER_02]: What is not included, though, with it is the ginormous, immense brick of a power supply that is not included with the kit.

1439
01:46:24,478 --> 01:46:30,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that would have bumped up the purchase price to $250, and they just weren't willing to do that.

1440
01:46:30,001 --> 01:46:32,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a red filter so you can create your red ring of death.

1441
01:46:33,175 --> 01:46:33,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

1442
01:46:33,755 --> 01:46:35,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, that too.

1443
01:46:35,356 --> 01:46:36,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does light up.

1444
01:46:36,896 --> 01:46:42,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like how the box, though, is the same box as the Xbox 360, which is pretty, pretty cool.

1445
01:46:42,957 --> 01:46:45,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do like that.

1446
01:46:45,098 --> 01:46:47,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And YYR says it's the original model or one of the slims.

1447
01:46:47,379 --> 01:46:48,119
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the original model.

1448
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:49,099
[SPEAKER_02]: The original model.

1449
01:46:49,099 --> 01:46:49,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1450
01:46:49,399 --> 01:46:50,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1451
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:50,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1452
01:46:50,799 --> 01:46:55,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pretty, you know, I did check it out.

1453
01:46:55,221 --> 01:46:55,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

1454
01:46:55,661 --> 01:46:56,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1455
01:46:56,101 --> 01:47:00,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little pricey, but, you know, it's not too bad for 1400 pieces.

1456
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:04,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what else?

1457
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:09,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, we've got more stuff coming to Nintendo Switch Online.

1458
01:47:09,262 --> 01:47:15,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So this week, we got a few Game Boy, Nintendo, and Super Nintendo games.

1459
01:47:15,544 --> 01:47:20,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with Quest for Camelot for the Super Nintendo.

1460
01:47:20,866 --> 01:47:23,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Kirby Star Stacker.

1461
01:47:24,752 --> 01:47:36,534
[SPEAKER_02]: and on the for the NES and then also downtown Nekketsu March Super Awesome Field Day and Joy Mech Fight.

1462
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:38,895
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Kunio game.

1463
01:47:38,895 --> 01:47:41,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it is a Kunio game.

1464
01:47:41,395 --> 01:47:49,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are as well for the Nintendo or yeah, for the NES.

1465
01:47:49,037 --> 01:47:50,897
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you have?

1466
01:47:52,334 --> 01:48:16,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, um, for fans of Call to the Lamb, like myself, uh, there is our custom controllers release that are available now, um, through a, uh, a website, uh, for Captain Alex, C-P-T-N-A-L-E-X, all in word, who's selling, uh, DualSense, Xbox controllers, Joy-Con, and Pro controllers, and,

1467
01:48:16,985 --> 01:48:24,768
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get one, you'll also get like with the special package, like 165 bucks for one.

1468
01:48:24,768 --> 01:48:39,133
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can get a licensed custom controller, premium packaging, a two inch hard enamel spinner pin that I kind of just want the pin and a stainless steel authenticity card that is signed by Captain Alex.

1469
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:45,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just go to CaptainAlex.com to see what they are.

1470
01:48:45,075 --> 01:48:46,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want the pin.

1471
01:48:46,076 --> 01:48:46,436
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

1472
01:48:48,864 --> 01:48:52,484
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, you heard about it in the intro, and this is just so silly.

1473
01:48:52,484 --> 01:48:53,385
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to talk about it.

1474
01:48:53,385 --> 01:48:54,965
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1475
01:48:54,965 --> 01:49:00,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't love video games more than Cup Noodle and all their various collaborations they do?

1476
01:49:00,306 --> 01:49:02,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all their collaborations.

1477
01:49:02,747 --> 01:49:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no collaboration that hasn't been amazing.

1478
01:49:06,468 --> 01:49:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they know that gamers apparently love Cup Noodle.

1479
01:49:09,568 --> 01:49:12,669
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, we're not being paid for this product placement, and I feel like we ought to be.

1480
01:49:12,669 --> 01:49:14,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was reported on CNN.

1481
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:15,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the news.

1482
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:15,750
[SPEAKER_03]: We should bring it up.

1483
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:19,152
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gaming Cup Noodle is coming out in Japan.

1484
01:49:19,152 --> 01:49:23,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not coming out here, but maybe Akuma JP is still out there can get us some.

1485
01:49:23,736 --> 01:49:26,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It is coming out on September 18th in Japan.

1486
01:49:26,558 --> 01:49:27,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming Cup Noodle.

1487
01:49:27,859 --> 01:49:31,441
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it's also a rainbow colored package that looks really cute.

1488
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:35,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say it's why what makes it Gaming Cup Noodle.

1489
01:49:35,224 --> 01:49:36,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It's caffeinated.

1490
01:49:38,281 --> 01:49:39,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Garlic and Black Pepper Yakisoba Varieties

1491
01:50:01,446 --> 01:50:08,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, again, obviously, when this showed up in Final Fantasy 15, it was a huge hilarity.

1492
01:50:08,731 --> 01:50:12,113
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, okay, let's let's just take we're gonna take the soup.

1493
01:50:12,113 --> 01:50:15,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's remove the soup, put caffeine in there instead.

1494
01:50:15,595 --> 01:50:18,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's gamers soup, but it's not soup.

1495
01:50:18,016 --> 01:50:19,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.

1496
01:50:19,557 --> 01:50:21,639
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love it because it's totally cup noodle.

1497
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:23,480
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it makes any sense.

1498
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:26,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most random fucking thing in the world that I'm here for it.

1499
01:50:26,562 --> 01:50:26,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1500
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:29,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's check in.

1501
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:40,315
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the type of leadership that we need for the ESA and Cup Noodle needs to run the E3 show.

1502
01:50:40,315 --> 01:50:41,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be insane.

1503
01:50:41,475 --> 01:50:42,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would just love it.

1504
01:50:42,616 --> 01:50:45,997
[SPEAKER_03]: We are at the point where Cup Noodle is a better run company than the ESA.

1505
01:50:45,997 --> 01:50:48,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1506
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:49,399
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% cosigned.

1507
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

1508
01:50:51,305 --> 01:50:58,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things you can pick up with your Cup Noodle gamer variety.

1509
01:50:58,675 --> 01:51:00,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start in the US, Loki.

1510
01:51:01,477 --> 01:51:02,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff.

1511
01:51:02,057 --> 01:51:08,619
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really in fourth quarter yet, but I mean, it's basically fourth quarter at this point.

1512
01:51:08,619 --> 01:51:12,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have Axiom Verge 2 on the Xbox One.

1513
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:17,621
[SPEAKER_02]: RainWorld on PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1514
01:51:17,621 --> 01:51:21,742
[SPEAKER_02]: The Valiant on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1515
01:51:21,742 --> 01:51:24,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Bugsnax on iOS.

1516
01:51:24,162 --> 01:51:26,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost in Play on iOS and Android.

1517

1567
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:44,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we have emails tonight.

1568
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:45,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to look.

1569
01:55:45,612 --> 01:55:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1570
01:55:45,852 --> 01:55:46,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out.

1571
01:55:46,213 --> 01:55:46,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1572
01:55:46,793 --> 01:55:47,194
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1573
01:55:47,194 --> 01:55:50,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe we'll get a call or two and some questions from chat as well.

1574
01:55:50,937 --> 01:55:53,300
[SPEAKER_03]: In just a little bit, we still have some stories starting with Loki.

1575
01:55:54,408 --> 01:56:02,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so we talked a little bit about this, I think a few weeks ago, about Xbox new reporting system that they're going to have.

1576
01:56:02,655 --> 01:56:09,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have actually launched it initially in the US, UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.

1577
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:21,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be for reporting abusive voice chats, and it allows you to, the system is going to capture 60 second clips and save it to your console, and you have 24 hours to complete your report.

1578
01:56:22,638 --> 01:56:31,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can send off the offending clips to Microsoft so they can ban somebody or at least give them seven warnings, I think, is what they had originally.

1579
01:56:31,524 --> 01:56:33,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the seven strike plan or whatever it was.

1580
01:56:33,405 --> 01:56:34,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven strike plan.

1581
01:56:34,486 --> 01:56:36,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's some game of baseball there.

1582
01:56:36,868 --> 01:56:48,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Our feature is designed so that only only you, the player, can initiate the capture of the last 60 seconds of gameplay activity that occurred for the content moderation purposes.

1583
01:56:48,435 --> 01:56:49,096
[SPEAKER_02]: That says it works.

1584
01:56:50,568 --> 01:56:59,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, they will not appear in your recent captures and the clips cannot be downloaded and modified or shared.

1585
01:56:59,871 --> 01:57:01,412
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1586
01:57:01,412 --> 01:57:02,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1587
01:57:02,192 --> 01:57:07,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, I mean, if it's abusive content, then you shouldn't share it.

1588
01:57:07,474 --> 01:57:07,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1589
01:57:07,834 --> 01:57:07,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1590
01:57:07,994 --> 01:57:08,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume.

1591
01:57:08,734 --> 01:57:10,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1592
01:57:10,235 --> 01:57:14,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess you got to really be on the ball, though, if it's, you know, only 60 seconds previously.

1593
01:57:14,796 --> 01:57:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it makes sense.

1594
01:57:17,689 --> 01:57:23,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I do feel like there's been a lot more companies that have been taking this sort of abuse that happens on platforms a little more seriously.

1595
01:57:23,593 --> 01:57:34,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've been seeing just, you know, because I've been playing a little more Overwatch lately, and I have seen people that are using the reporting features in there and you actually get the actual reports that say something happened, which is nice.

1596
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:37,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish other games I've played in the past would do something like that.

1597
01:57:37,702 --> 01:57:38,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1598
01:57:56,018 --> 01:58:08,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, um, let's just let's just hope it leads to cleaning up some of these things that we assume to be true about Xbox Live and a place where everyone feels welcome, which is very important.

1599
01:58:08,372 --> 01:58:10,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura.

1600
01:58:13,637 --> 01:58:19,399
[SPEAKER_00]: For the game Sea of Stars, their developer Sabotage is working on some DLC.

1601
01:58:19,399 --> 01:58:22,080
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, this is a retro RPG.

1602
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:26,121
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty well liked from what I understand.

1603
01:58:26,121 --> 01:58:30,282
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Canada Radio, their CEO, Thierry Boulanger, I guess.

1604
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:37,407
[SPEAKER_00]: was basically saying that there's going to be some new stuff.

1605
01:58:37,407 --> 01:58:50,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was also a blog post at the time that said, a fully fledged side adventure DLC would be called Throws of the Watchmaker and would expand even more on the world of Sea of Stars.

1606
01:58:50,336 --> 01:58:50,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.

1607
01:58:51,733 --> 01:58:56,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely like that's one of those games that just came out in this last week was like, Oh my god, I got to get around to that too.

1608
01:58:56,194 --> 01:58:57,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've heard a lot of good things about it.

1609
01:58:57,975 --> 01:59:05,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Just you know, that it really feels like some type of spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger.

1610
01:59:05,137 --> 01:59:07,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why there's this rumor out there that I hate Chrono Trigger.

1611
01:59:07,798 --> 01:59:09,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

1612
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:13,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited to check out this game and check it out.

1613
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks really cool.

1614
01:59:14,541 --> 01:59:18,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I've saw a little bit of streaming of it, but not at times I didn't want to spoil it for myself.

1615
01:59:18,822 --> 01:59:18,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1616
01:59:21,438 --> 01:59:24,060
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki.

1617
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:24,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1618
01:59:24,681 --> 01:59:38,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So that wonderful game, Stray, about the cat wandering through a cyberpunk dystopia is apparently going to be getting a movie, an animated movie.

1619
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:45,556
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, you know, it's called The Greatest Hope Punk Movie That's Ever Been Made.

1620
01:59:47,826 --> 01:59:48,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about it.

1621
01:59:48,627 --> 01:59:51,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be a good property to make an animated movie for.

1622
01:59:51,989 --> 01:59:59,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what ends up happening with that when it's coming.

1623
01:59:59,634 --> 01:59:59,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

1624
02:00:02,855 --> 02:00:09,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, um, I obviously we are seeing a lot of games get adapted into movies and TV and all that sort.

1625
02:00:09,356 --> 02:00:21,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't say it's too surprising, but it's kind of cool because that stray, I don't want to say it came out of nowhere, but like, I, you know, they announced it and everybody was like, Ooh, the cat game.

1626
02:00:21,498 --> 02:00:23,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody then kind of like jumped on board with it.

1627
02:00:23,659 --> 02:00:25,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And it did, it did very well as a result.

1628
02:00:25,999 --> 02:00:29,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, because it delivered on being the cat game.

1629
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:31,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I think people really had fun with it.

1630
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:31,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of

1631
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:42,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't realize that Annapurna is actually, they have an animation studio, Annapurna Animation, that they made a Nimora or Nimona on Netflix.

1632
02:00:42,595 --> 02:00:44,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've already done animated movies.

1633
02:00:44,157 --> 02:00:47,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they get to use their own property for that.

1634
02:00:47,862 --> 02:00:48,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1635
02:00:48,960 --> 02:01:02,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclawchat says the title might cause confusion because there was a movie called Strays, a dog movie that's rated R. Eh, we get movies that come out with the same title sometimes, like, you know, after a few years go by, and I don't think this is something that's going to be coming out this year.

1636
02:01:02,234 --> 02:01:03,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a few years off.

1637
02:01:03,415 --> 02:01:08,481
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just put the cute cat on the poster, the little box art.

1638
02:01:08,481 --> 02:01:09,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'll separate it.

1639
02:01:09,222 --> 02:01:09,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1640
02:01:13,562 --> 02:01:16,343
[SPEAKER_03]: and Crystal Skies points out they finished Nimona.

1641
02:01:16,343 --> 02:01:17,923
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't fully make it.

1642
02:01:17,923 --> 02:01:18,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, got it.

1643
02:01:18,363 --> 02:01:18,663
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1644
02:01:18,663 --> 02:01:19,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

1645
02:01:19,263 --> 02:01:19,363
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1646
02:01:19,363 --> 02:01:20,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1647
02:01:20,944 --> 02:01:21,904
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1648
02:01:21,904 --> 02:01:24,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we got one more here.

1649
02:01:24,785 --> 02:01:27,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a little bit surprising.

1650
02:01:27,545 --> 02:01:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of came out of nowhere, but I'm having a Flappy Bird kind of moment hearing about this.

1651
02:01:32,246 --> 02:01:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not exactly.

1652
02:01:34,467 --> 02:01:35,027
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

1653
02:01:35,027 --> 02:01:36,027
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well, let's talk about it.

1654
02:01:36,027 --> 02:01:38,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is the viral game Only Up.

1655
02:01:39,288 --> 02:01:43,312
[SPEAKER_03]: which you may have seen played on Twitch because a lot of people have been playing it on Twitch.

1656
02:01:43,312 --> 02:01:44,773
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no longer available on Steam.

1657
02:01:44,773 --> 02:01:46,815
[SPEAKER_03]: It was delisted from Steam.

1658
02:01:46,815 --> 02:01:54,583
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is had a lot of interesting chat around it because there's been talk about infringing assets because somebody Yeah, that's there's that

1659
02:01:54,923 --> 02:01:55,263
[SPEAKER_03]: TheFNDC.com

1660
02:02:14,516 --> 02:02:19,040
[SPEAKER_03]: But now the creator of the game says they need to put the game behind them due to stress.

1661
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:25,026
[SPEAKER_03]: What I need now is peace of mind and healing, says the developer SCKR Games.

1662
02:02:25,026 --> 02:02:36,777
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an update on the Steam page about the decision, saying, I'm a solo developer and this game is my first experience in game dev, a game I did for creativity to test myself and where I made a lot of mistakes.

1663
02:02:37,743 --> 02:02:40,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The game has kept me under a lot of stress all these months.

1664
02:02:40,485 --> 02:02:41,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to put the game behind me.

1665
02:02:41,885 --> 02:02:45,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, the game will be available in the Steam store soon.

1666
02:02:45,207 --> 02:02:47,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I decided myself.

1667
02:02:47,268 --> 02:02:50,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, it is no longer available.

1668
02:02:50,370 --> 02:02:52,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make an NFT game.

1669
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't necessarily think the NFT part was that big.

1670
02:02:57,342 --> 02:02:59,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't, like, it wasn't, that wasn't front and center.

1671
02:02:59,303 --> 02:03:01,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, like, it's not in the game.

1672
02:03:01,064 --> 02:03:05,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say maybe the developer at one point, like, talked about it, possibly.

1673
02:03:05,346 --> 02:03:08,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's one of those things that I think the headline got bigger than it actually was.

1674
02:03:09,462 --> 02:03:11,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would think weren't in the game.

1675
02:03:11,023 --> 02:03:11,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1676
02:03:11,283 --> 02:03:14,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was a lot of the infringing assets.

1677
02:03:14,144 --> 02:03:15,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was some contention before.

1678
02:03:15,845 --> 02:03:17,245
[SPEAKER_03]: That was legit.

1679
02:03:17,245 --> 02:03:17,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1680
02:03:17,586 --> 02:03:19,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Because so I'm wondering.

1681
02:03:19,026 --> 02:03:27,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm wondering if it's more of like legal pressure, you know, to like, OK, let's put this.

1682
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:34,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let's let's take this away so no one else can find more assets or infringe type of thing, because I'm just a solo dev.

1683
02:03:34,213 --> 02:03:38,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I get sued, I'm going to be in trouble because I don't have a lot of money.

1684
02:03:39,467 --> 02:03:43,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bobby points out that there was NFT iconography in the game.

1685
02:03:43,052 --> 02:03:50,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe there were, the dev was probably a fan of this, and probably inserted some of that into the game.

1686
02:03:50,941 --> 02:03:53,585
[SPEAKER_03]: But did the game itself use NFTs?

1687
02:03:53,585 --> 02:03:55,067
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not appear so.

1688
02:03:55,067 --> 02:03:57,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but

1689
02:03:58,825 --> 02:04:07,949
[SPEAKER_03]: All that aside, it was very popular on Twitch, and it's not often you hear about popular games where the developer just says, I'm out, and just up and leaves.

1690
02:04:07,949 --> 02:04:12,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of why I pulled in the reference to Flappy Bird, which I know is a bit of a different circumstance.

1691
02:04:12,912 --> 02:04:19,335
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's another one where I think, right at the height of that game's fame, the guy said, I don't want to do this anymore.

1692
02:04:20,422 --> 02:04:21,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1693
02:04:21,182 --> 02:04:22,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was that was it.

1694
02:04:22,783 --> 02:04:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And by golly, he stuck to his word.

1695
02:04:25,324 --> 02:04:26,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1696
02:04:26,064 --> 02:04:30,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So I it's interesting to see this happen.

1697
02:04:30,745 --> 02:04:33,126
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, basically leaving that money on the table.

1698
02:04:33,126 --> 02:04:35,447
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I get it.

1699
02:04:35,447 --> 02:04:37,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of stress when you're this one person.

1700
02:04:37,527 --> 02:04:45,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Your game is under a microscope and people are talking about NFT references or, you know, the status of where certain assets came from and so forth.

1701
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:47,831
[SPEAKER_02]: or just updating your game.

1702
02:04:47,831 --> 02:04:49,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just don't want to do it anymore.

1703
02:04:49,451 --> 02:04:52,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want to support this game anymore.

1704
02:04:52,173 --> 02:04:58,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I can't sit here and say I blame him, but it's like, you know, you got to put your mental health above everything else, period.

1705
02:04:58,996 --> 02:05:00,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always going to support that.

1706
02:05:00,536 --> 02:05:10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is just still so you don't often see people walk away from this level of a game with the exposure that it had for that.

1707
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just kind of what makes this like surprising.

1708
02:05:12,441 --> 02:05:12,902
[SPEAKER_03]: But I

1709
02:05:14,141 --> 02:05:16,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't wish the developer any ill will for sure.

1710
02:05:16,262 --> 02:05:23,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he finds the piece he's looking for with this decision because that is that is a lot of money to leave behind.

1711
02:05:23,306 --> 02:05:24,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck to him.

1712
02:05:26,493 --> 02:05:36,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, let's go to our roundtable where we will solicit any other questions y'all might have for us in our chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1713
02:05:36,497 --> 02:05:38,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's twitch.tv VOG Network.

1714
02:05:38,798 --> 02:05:44,640
[SPEAKER_03]: You could also if you want to head on over to our Discord, you can hop in the green room and we'll take some calls.

1715
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:47,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe DarkSakura already mentioned we have no emails tonight.

1716
02:05:47,761 --> 02:05:55,084
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you'd like to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLingerie.com is a great place to do it.

1717
02:05:55,084 --> 02:06:04,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I will admit I did not check our Twitter this week to see if we got anything but I will take a look at that real quick just because I've been on that website less and less but

1718
02:06:05,867 --> 02:06:08,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I will still take a look.

1719
02:06:08,248 --> 02:06:10,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I see DarkSakura's plug for the show.

1720
02:06:10,609 --> 02:06:11,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess I could.

1721
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:18,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I did tag OLR in this, but since it's somewhat related, talking a little bit about Starfield real quick.

1722
02:06:18,732 --> 02:06:24,715
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I did like in Starfield was that they have some really cute little Easter eggs in some of the art.

1723
02:06:24,715 --> 02:06:29,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very tangential to Fallout and some of the interesting things you see there.

1724
02:06:29,457 --> 02:06:32,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I was raiding a random moon base and I saw this poster

1725
02:06:32,958 --> 02:06:33,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Rely on each other.

1726
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:58,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I love those cute little like Easter eggs that are in the environment.

1727
02:06:58,184 --> 02:07:09,275
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I feel like this is something you can appreciate too when you used to do things like the Mass Affecting blog, where you know, you would go around and find all these things in the environment, like store names on the Citadel and things like that.

1728
02:07:09,275 --> 02:07:10,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

1729
02:07:10,036 --> 02:07:11,818
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's Intimate Lingerie.

1730
02:07:11,818 --> 02:07:14,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, like that stuff like that is really funny to me.

1731
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:16,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a last minute story if you'd want.

1732
02:07:16,482 --> 02:07:17,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, let's do it.

1733
02:07:17,963 --> 02:07:22,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So this comes from a I don't know.

1734
02:07:22,447 --> 02:07:27,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I guess it's from a website, The Boy from Mexico.

1735
02:07:27,192 --> 02:07:32,116
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this guy, Edward Dennis, who's talking about his book.

1736
02:07:32,116 --> 02:07:39,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the about this Edward Dennis guy, this is artist, author, animator, game designer.

1737
02:07:39,563 --> 02:07:41,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the blurbs in here says

1738
02:07:44,837 --> 02:07:52,703
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to this, Edward is working with Paramount Pictures on a video adaptation of their Twin Peaks property.

1739
02:07:52,703 --> 02:07:56,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously, not a video adaptation.

1740
02:07:56,486 --> 02:08:01,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the referencing video game is just mistyped in here.

1741
02:08:01,169 --> 02:08:06,953
[SPEAKER_02]: But, could there be a Twin Peaks game coming from Paramount?

1742
02:08:08,116 --> 02:08:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, could that have just been placeholder text or something?

1743
02:08:11,598 --> 02:08:11,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1744
02:08:11,958 --> 02:08:13,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little this.

1745
02:08:13,698 --> 02:08:16,560
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reach to me.

1746
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would love to see some type of official Twin Peaks game.

1747
02:08:20,481 --> 02:08:21,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1748
02:08:21,402 --> 02:08:23,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see it as something David Lynch would get into.

1749
02:08:24,758 --> 02:08:28,203
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's where my that's the real block for my mind.

1750
02:08:28,203 --> 02:08:36,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't want to, you know, just because this is just a random thing, I'm, you know, person I've never heard of, I don't want to necessarily dismiss it on that alone.

1751
02:08:36,514 --> 02:08:39,458
[SPEAKER_03]: But just the concept, I feel like David Lynch would hate it.

1752
02:08:40,545 --> 02:08:44,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So I unless somebody has talked him into it, which great.

1753
02:08:44,246 --> 02:08:47,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see this as something David Lynch would ever embrace.

1754
02:08:47,107 --> 02:08:48,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't.

1755
02:08:48,507 --> 02:08:55,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, granted, I feel like he has ultimate control over the IP because that's why it took so long for there to be a reboot.

1756
02:08:55,949 --> 02:09:01,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose if Paramount own that or Showtime or whatever now, maybe they could go around him.

1757
02:09:01,671 --> 02:09:06,112
[SPEAKER_03]: But I I just know if he's not involved, it's going to suck.

1758
02:09:08,059 --> 02:09:09,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the fact.

1759
02:09:09,519 --> 02:09:11,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

1760
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1761
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:14,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwell says that might be I had a phone call with them once.

1762
02:09:14,841 --> 02:09:18,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's a little bit that's kind of the vibes I get from that.

1763
02:09:18,501 --> 02:09:25,703
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, if if somebody has convinced David Lynch to make a video game, then fuck yeah, I'm here for it.

1764
02:09:25,703 --> 02:09:34,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, it might be a great way to continue the story of Twin Peaks, because the reality is a lot of key actors and actresses in Twin Peaks are dying.

1765
02:09:34,165 --> 02:09:35,405
[SPEAKER_03]: They're passing away.

1766
02:09:35,405 --> 02:09:37,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The Log Lady is no longer with us.

1767
02:09:39,007 --> 02:09:43,209
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the prominent FBI folks is no longer with us.

1768
02:09:43,209 --> 02:09:44,730
[SPEAKER_03]: David Bowie passed away.

1769
02:09:44,730 --> 02:09:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of found a way around that in the return.

1770
02:09:47,993 --> 02:09:53,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But video games would be a way for the universe of Twin Peaks to live on.

1771
02:09:54,995 --> 02:10:03,899
[SPEAKER_03]: without having to rely on, you know, if certain people are going to be physically able or present to do a Twin Peaks continuation.

1772
02:10:03,899 --> 02:10:09,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if somebody has been able to convince David Lynch of that, then fucking awesome.

1773
02:10:09,821 --> 02:10:16,023
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just as a big fan of Twin Peaks, my big reaction is, oh, David Lynch would never go for that.

1774
02:10:16,023 --> 02:10:17,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

1775
02:10:17,344 --> 02:10:19,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he'll have to die and it'll be his estate.

1776
02:10:19,825 --> 02:10:21,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to be many years.

1777
02:10:21,385 --> 02:10:21,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1778
02:10:23,646 --> 02:10:28,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Babylon 5 continued last month with an animated movie.

1779
02:10:28,628 --> 02:10:31,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how they cast new voices for the actors who passed.

1780
02:10:31,470 --> 02:10:34,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very, very similar to that concept.

1781
02:10:34,571 --> 02:10:39,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So wouldn't be too unlike what happened with the Doctor Who.

1782
02:10:39,714 --> 02:10:41,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Second Doctor episodes.

1783
02:10:41,034 --> 02:10:42,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1784
02:10:42,095 --> 02:10:43,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1785
02:10:43,075 --> 02:10:45,676
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to remake them in animation.

1786
02:10:45,676 --> 02:10:46,737
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.

1787
02:10:46,737 --> 02:10:46,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1788
02:10:47,911 --> 02:10:51,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane in chat says, I need more Twin Peaks media any way I can get it.

1789
02:10:51,533 --> 02:10:52,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a game.

1790
02:10:52,654 --> 02:10:55,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That PSX demo looked very good.

1791
02:10:55,175 --> 02:11:00,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It did look good, but it didn't really look... I don't know how fun of a game it is.

1792
02:11:00,839 --> 02:11:08,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the entire... and I don't want to disrespect the folks that worked hard on that, because again, as a fan, I think that's a really great fan project.

1793
02:11:08,783 --> 02:11:11,844
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's all it's going to be is a, oh, that's neat.

1794
02:11:11,844 --> 02:11:13,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look what they did there.

1795
02:11:13,005 --> 02:11:14,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a cool reference.

1796
02:11:14,565 --> 02:11:16,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that.

1797
02:11:16,306 --> 02:11:19,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to really build on the universe.

1798
02:11:19,847 --> 02:11:32,472
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking a legit Twin Peaks video game, I'm expecting that it is continuing the universe and the, you know, essentially mythology at this point behind Twin Peaks and continuing those stories.

1799
02:11:34,333 --> 02:11:37,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to have the fucking ending of The Return explained.

1800
02:11:37,636 --> 02:11:48,766
[SPEAKER_03]: The wild thing about Twin Peaks The Return, if you watch all but the next to last episode, you're like, wow, they really brought this full circle.

1801
02:11:48,766 --> 02:11:49,747
[SPEAKER_03]: This is incredible.

1802
02:11:50,207 --> 02:11:57,430
[SPEAKER_03]: They, I mean, they do it kind of fast, but like, the way they tie it back to the very beginning is like, holy shit, this is incredible.

1803
02:11:57,430 --> 02:12:00,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, he really did know this was it the whole time.

1804
02:12:00,612 --> 02:12:05,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it took us, you know, 25 years to get here, but here we are, it was mind blowing.

1805
02:12:05,294 --> 02:12:09,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get one more episode, the very last episode, and you're like,

1806
02:12:11,282 --> 02:12:12,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck was that?

1807
02:12:12,944 --> 02:12:14,606
[SPEAKER_03]: What now?

1808
02:12:14,606 --> 02:12:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

1809
02:12:16,128 --> 02:12:17,450
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1810
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:22,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the way it ends, you know, very much like the original Twin Peaks series itself.

1811
02:12:22,636 --> 02:12:23,577
[SPEAKER_03]: How's Annie?

1812
02:12:23,577 --> 02:12:25,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the way this ends is just like,

1813
02:12:27,195 --> 02:12:29,877
[SPEAKER_03]: that that is too much of a cliffhanger.

1814
02:12:29,877 --> 02:12:32,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, Shane said that's why I need more.

1815
02:12:32,218 --> 02:12:33,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same.

1816
02:12:33,179 --> 02:12:36,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love nothing more than another Twin Peaks season four.

1817
02:12:36,962 --> 02:12:49,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But as the more and more time that passes, the less and less likely it is that it's going to happen unless they they really do change the year and have a completely different cast in there or something.

1818
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:49,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1819
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:51,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how they do it.

1820
02:12:51,952 --> 02:12:52,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

1821
02:12:54,249 --> 02:12:59,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um, any other last minute stories, Loki?

1822
02:12:59,472 --> 02:13:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no.

1823
02:13:00,232 --> 02:13:01,133
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1824
02:13:01,133 --> 02:13:07,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with that, then I think we're towards the end of another episode and we will start to wrap things up.

1825
02:13:07,236 --> 02:13:09,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll say goodbye first to DarkSakuras.

1826
02:13:09,417 --> 02:13:11,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you're going to do your thing.

1827
02:13:11,898 --> 02:13:17,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you have any final thoughts or party words for us tonight?

1828
02:13:17,621 --> 02:13:18,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a request.

1829
02:13:19,759 --> 02:13:27,626
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone is in a thrift store and they see one of the Echo Kichama Jigs, they're like these slotted spoon things.

1830
02:13:27,626 --> 02:13:28,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy it for me, please.

1831
02:13:28,707 --> 02:13:29,668
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pay for shipping.

1832
02:13:29,668 --> 02:13:31,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking for one.

1833
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:32,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

1834
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:34,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a slotted spoon thing?

1835
02:13:34,372 --> 02:13:36,253
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super convenient.

1836
02:13:36,253 --> 02:13:39,696
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a kind of a slotted spoon spatula sort of thing.

1837
02:13:39,696 --> 02:13:43,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like this holy grail of kitchen equipment because you can fry with it and do all this stuff.

1838
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:46,182
[SPEAKER_00]: And I super want one because we used to have one when I was a kid.

1839
02:13:47,230 --> 02:13:47,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

1840
02:13:47,870 --> 02:13:50,070
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a very neat spoon.

1841
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:52,731
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone wants to know what it is, just look it up.

1842
02:13:52,731 --> 02:13:53,591
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1843
02:13:53,591 --> 02:13:55,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, have fun with your Dead by Daylighting tonight.

1844
02:13:55,331 --> 02:13:56,252
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in a little bit.

1845
02:13:56,252 --> 02:13:56,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1846
02:13:56,992 --> 02:13:59,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was a random one, but that's the truth.

1847
02:13:59,412 --> 02:13:59,892
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.

1848
02:13:59,892 --> 02:14:00,232
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1849
02:14:00,232 --> 02:14:01,192
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see y'all later.

1850
02:14:01,192 --> 02:14:01,492
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1851
02:14:01,492 --> 02:14:01,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

1852
02:14:01,873 --> 02:14:02,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1853
02:14:02,333 --> 02:14:03,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

1854
02:14:03,733 --> 02:14:04,493
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1855
02:14:04,493 --> 02:14:07,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki, last but not least, your final thought.

1856
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:07,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, no, wait.

1857
02:14:07,894 --> 02:14:08,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

1858
02:14:08,214 --> 02:14:16,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to your final thought, let me say, thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio and downloading our show, whether you were here live or you were listening to us in the podcast feed.

1859
02:14:16,598 --> 02:14:18,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

1860
02:14:18,458 --> 02:14:19,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

1861
02:14:19,699 --> 02:14:24,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1862
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,421
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show, like Spotify, whatever.

1863
02:14:29,421 --> 02:14:31,201
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes an awful long way as well.

1864
02:14:31,201 --> 02:14:32,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate all of that.

1865
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:43,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we would really appreciate a follow for VOG Network over not just on Twitch, but on YouTube as well, as well as our social medias, both Blue Sky and Twatter.

1866
02:14:45,812 --> 02:14:48,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, now I'll go to your final thought.

1867
02:14:48,795 --> 02:14:54,420
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is tomorrow at noon, Pacific and 3 p.m.

1868
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:58,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern will be when I debut my finale for season two.

1869
02:14:58,444 --> 02:14:59,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for that.

1870
02:14:59,265 --> 02:15:04,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be on the YouTube feed as a premiere, probably later tonight.

1871
02:15:04,329 --> 02:15:09,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be up on social media later tonight, probably as well.

1872
02:15:10,896 --> 02:15:18,022
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember and I don't have a meeting that bleeds into noon, which sometimes happens, I will lurk in the channel.

1873
02:15:19,306 --> 02:15:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1874
02:15:19,706 --> 02:15:21,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just watch it whenever.

1875
02:15:21,048 --> 02:15:22,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.

1876
02:15:22,669 --> 02:15:23,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you get you those views.

1877
02:15:23,970 --> 02:15:24,791
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1878
02:15:24,791 --> 02:15:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1879
02:15:26,713 --> 02:15:28,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see my final thought tonight.

1880
02:15:28,334 --> 02:15:30,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again to DragonCon for a great time.

1881
02:15:30,936 --> 02:15:32,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to TwitchCon in a few weeks.

1882
02:15:32,918 --> 02:15:36,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I'm starting Baldur's Gate 3 tonight.

1883
02:15:36,401 --> 02:15:40,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to be doing some playing on my own channel tomorrow with Baldur's Gate 3 after work.

1884
02:15:40,605 --> 02:15:42,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1885
02:16:08,555 --> 02:16:17,300
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for our live show, tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.
