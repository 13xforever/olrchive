00:00.000 --> 00:30.000
What does a KFC Double Down and 70 Dollar Games have in common? Both of them exist because people think they're valuable. The Double Down Cross Diablo 4 shenanigans are rumored to be coming back giving you quote unquote free in-game cosmetics while your IRL1s are staying. The saving grace for me is that my closest KFC closed down in April. I was planning on trying out a Double Down for the first time and giving my coat away to a friend. Oops. This is your greasy finger update.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell me more about these and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:00.000 --> 01:23.080
Hi.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.120
Hi, how are you?

01:24.920 --> 01:25.760
I'm okay.

01:25.780 --> 01:26.280
Yeah.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.360
I'm a little tired.

01:27.480 --> 01:34.560
I was gonna say, I've been reading on social media your increased ballet activity and this working out you're doing to support that.

01:35.280 --> 01:42.320
It doesn't help that some feline in my house named Midna woke me up by smacking wood blinds around.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.080
That's not nice.

01:43.080 --> 01:47.800
But I got up and is armed a gun show.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.800
Hey, now that should be a point redeemed. All right.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.000
It is a redeem in my channel.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.280
Is it? Okay, that's good.

01:54.920 --> 01:55.760
Yeah, no, seriously.

01:55.760 --> 02:01.480
I put it in there for Fixie because Fixie mentioned it, so I put it in there.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.960
We need to think about point redeems here at VOG Network.

02:03.960 --> 02:11.920
We used to do the collection plates for the special streams and technically we still, we still, I know we still owe the listeners a foodie.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.680
I'm sorry, everybody, but you know, the drama that happened there, we'll, we'll, we'll get on scheduling that.

02:16.680 --> 02:26.040
Maybe it can be a thing for our anniversary because believe it or not, I was just looking at the calendar today and we're less than, we're less than a month away from our 21st anniversary.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.800
This show will be old enough to drink.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.560
That's right.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.160
You know what that means, Rob?

02:30.240 --> 02:30.560
What?

02:30.560 --> 02:31.080
You know what that means?

02:31.080 --> 02:31.440
What?

02:31.640 --> 02:35.400
We, we might have to do a drunk show revival.

02:35.440 --> 02:42.160
I, I, I may have a libation or two on the show, but I have to work the next day.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.480
I can't drink like that anymore though.

02:43.480 --> 02:43.840
I know.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.760
I can't.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.400
Yeah, not the way we used to here.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.000
Uh, but maybe.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.560
I mean, just physically, I don't have an actual stomach anymore.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.560
Maybe we can give all of our drinks to the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.040
Maybe.

02:59.120 --> 02:59.400
Maybe.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.800
Although I don't think you drink much these days anymore either.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.640
No, not really.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.160
I have to steal Loki's waffles again.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.240
I did eventually buy you waffles.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.560
Those are some good times.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.000
Um, uh, dark to see in chat.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.720
Uh, I'm, I'm curious if you happen to know what episode number that

03:16.720 --> 03:19.760
particular show we keep referencing was, cause I know it's deep within the

03:19.760 --> 03:26.520
archives, um, it was episode number something, uh, I love this comment from

03:26.520 --> 03:31.560
Fixie in our chat or fixation gaze to use the legal name, uh, saying a point

03:31.560 --> 03:33.960
redeem for news stories, like picking a topic.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.440
I love that idea, but to be fair, we, we let people do that for free.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.120
Uh, if you want to submit topic ideas are like a coffee talk.

03:41.160 --> 03:41.480
Yeah.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.400
Our, our discord is always open.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.040
You know, we don't, we don't require the point redeems for that, but I do

03:46.040 --> 03:50.680
love the idea in theory, but then Fixie goes on to say, uh, Oh wow.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.040
This show is only a year-ish older than me.

03:53.520 --> 03:53.880
Okay.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.040
Now, now you can leave.

04:02.040 --> 04:02.680
Thank you.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.240
Thank you, but please stop immediately.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.120
I'm just kidding.

04:12.120 --> 04:12.560
Don't leave.

04:13.440 --> 04:13.880
Mentally.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.160
I haven't aged at all.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.000
I know.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.360
I know it's, it's so funny.

04:18.360 --> 04:24.640
Like I'm, you know, around the time that this show turns 21, uh, I will turn 45.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.680
Uh, so I have a multiple of five birthday coming up, which I guess those are kind

04:28.680 --> 04:31.880
of big deals, I guess, depending on, you know, how you view those types of things.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.200
And you know, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, now that

04:35.200 --> 04:39.920
I'm halfway to 50 in this decade, it's like, do I feel older?

04:39.920 --> 04:43.960
It's like, not really like actually, no, you know what it was?

04:43.960 --> 04:47.920
I wrote this on a blue sky or Twitter or one of those this week.

04:47.960 --> 04:48.200
Okay.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.040
Here's the thing.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.400
So there's a, I'm not going to get into politics too much tonight.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.120
I promise.

04:53.120 --> 04:59.280
However, there is a certain really ugly political candidate who threw their hat in

04:59.280 --> 05:00.880
the ring for president this week.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.080
And if you think about one of the ugliest people you've ever seen on TV, you'll know

05:05.080 --> 05:06.280
exactly who I'm talking about.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.360
Here's the wild orange or is it the other one?

05:09.400 --> 05:13.320
No, they're not orange, but they got married at Disneyland and then never went

05:13.320 --> 05:14.840
again or Disney world, excuse me.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.520
And then never went again.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.640
Apparently, um, that is blasphemous.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.680
Anyhow, I don't want to get into that, but what I do want to get into is that that

05:22.680 --> 05:26.640
guy is like six months younger than me.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.440
Here's the thing I said, thank you.

05:30.480 --> 05:30.800
Thank you.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.520
Like, look, I'm humble.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.640
I try not to have a gigantic ego.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.680
I know people joke about it, but I try to be humble and everything, but I know, I

05:38.680 --> 05:42.240
know I'm way better looking than that guy, but here it is.

05:42.240 --> 05:42.800
Here's my seat.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.240
I'm going to tell you, here's my secret and dark soccer.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.560
I know you share the secret.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.240
Do you know what the secret is to staying young and good looking?

05:51.280 --> 05:52.240
I'll be a deuce bag.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.920
Support trans rights.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.240
That's, that's it.

05:56.280 --> 05:56.560
That's it.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.880
If you support, I thought mine was spite.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.880
No, if you support trans rights, it will keep you young and good looking.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.640
If you don't, then you're going to look like, you know, who?

06:07.800 --> 06:08.240
Her.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.880
That one, that person that shall not be named.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.000
So there it is.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.280
Hushido.

06:15.920 --> 06:16.400
All right.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.360
Except to have a friend named Hushido, so nevermind.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.440
Anyway, all right.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.080
I promise.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.240
I also, I also think spite though, does help.

06:24.320 --> 06:24.680
Yes.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.160
Spite, spite helps a little bit.

06:26.200 --> 06:32.280
Um, anyway, and there's this whole talk on social media about pride month, and

06:32.280 --> 06:36.640
there are certain people on Twitter who are always hating, who took this pride

06:36.640 --> 06:40.720
month and they turned it into a graphic where as it goes down, pride month,

06:40.720 --> 06:44.200
pride month, and then in the bottom, it says demon in rainbow.

06:44.360 --> 06:48.400
And I'm like, they really thought they owned us with that graphic, but never

06:48.400 --> 06:55.160
have I wanted a t-shirt more than the big demon energy that pride month brings us.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.360
I'm going to make it.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.280
Just you wait.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.280
I will make that.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.880
Just be careful because I believe there may actually be a, um, trans artist who's

07:02.880 --> 07:05.360
claiming that they actually came up with that idea first.

07:05.400 --> 07:10.200
So I, but, but take, take a look on social media and find out or put your own twist

07:10.200 --> 07:10.440
on it.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.200
I'll do it in another language.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.520
Ah, there you go.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.040
All right.

07:15.320 --> 07:15.800
That works.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.800
Um, anyway, uh, let's get to the show.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.200
We're going to get to some of those, uh, big announcements from the PlayStation

07:23.200 --> 07:26.560
showcase this week, but first we actually have a special message.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.800
I mentioned, uh, Bobby Black Wolf was not here at the voice of geeks network

07:29.800 --> 07:34.280
tonight because he is currently out in Minneapolis at the summer games done

07:34.280 --> 07:34.760
quick.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.560
I almost wanted to say convention, but it's not really convention.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.880
It's, you know, charity fundraiser that's con adjacent, but the way it was also

07:42.880 --> 07:47.040
explained to me is that it's very much like a cruise, but not floating in the

07:47.040 --> 07:51.920
water because it's, you know, that week of programming that apparently there's

07:51.920 --> 07:56.200
excursions for people wanting to go into downtown Minneapolis and all this stuff.

07:56.200 --> 07:56.720
So, yeah.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.600
So anyway, we have a special video message from the one and only Bobby

08:00.600 --> 08:04.600
Black Wolf, uh, filmed earlier today, live in Minneapolis going to give us a

08:04.600 --> 08:05.760
little look behind the scenes.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.960
Sorry to my cohost.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.600
You're not going to hear this as it plays, but we'll summarize this on the

08:09.600 --> 08:10.120
other side.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.800
So let's turn it over to Bobby Black Wolf at summer games done quick.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.960
Hello, orange launch radio, Bobby Black Wolf here.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.400
Sorry.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.440
I couldn't be there tonight.

08:18.440 --> 08:18.760
Sorry.

08:18.760 --> 08:24.160
I allowed you to actually start on time, but I am at summer games done quick 20,

08:24.160 --> 08:27.600
23 in beautiful downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.680
I am once again, hosting in person, one of the 22 hosts really looking forward

08:32.680 --> 08:37.280
to it, but I wanted to give you a little bit of a taste, a look of what it looks

08:37.280 --> 08:41.880
like here at, uh, it's kind of a convention, but not really, but this week

08:41.880 --> 08:45.120
long event, uh, some of the arcade machines have already gotten in.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.920
There's going to be more arcade machines loaded in today and tomorrow.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.640
Uh, so when, if you tune into my show, the Bobby Black Wolf show next week, you

08:51.640 --> 08:55.560
will see more of what things look like as the week progresses.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.240
They're still kind of in the setup mode.

08:57.240 --> 09:02.320
Now, if you want to catch me on the air, I am going to be working on Monday

09:02.320 --> 09:08.200
morning at around 11 AM Eastern, 8 AM Pacific alien swarm attack on Titan two

09:08.200 --> 09:10.640
and crisis core final fantasy seven reunion.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.640
And then Tuesday night at around 11 PM Eastern 8 PM Pacific, I'm going to be

09:15.640 --> 09:18.400
hosting for silent Hill, home, poor and signal us.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.920
Now you've probably never heard of silent Hill home poor.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.160
You've heard of homecoming and downpour.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.360
Well, silent Hill downpour has.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.880
No skippable cut scenes, unskippable cut scenes.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.880
So they play silent Hill homecoming during the cut scenes of downpour, and

09:32.880 --> 09:38.400
they can actually finish homecoming twice during the unskippable cut scenes of

09:38.400 --> 09:40.320
downpour, so that's going to be a lot of fun.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.160
Uh, so check them out over at games done quick.com or over at

09:44.160 --> 09:48.840
twitch.tv slash games done quick donations, go to doctors without borders.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.720
Uh, so, uh, get, get some donations in if you are able, but if not, at least enjoy

09:53.720 --> 09:56.680
the marathon, I'll let you get back to orange lounge radio now.

09:58.000 --> 09:58.240
All right.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.960
Thank you so much, Bobby black Wolf for that report from Minneapolis where

10:01.960 --> 10:03.640
summer games done quick is going on.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.800
Now I'm actually told, and he did say that I could repeat this.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.240
So when I first saw the video and you could see, I'm sorry to the podcast

10:10.240 --> 10:13.200
listeners, you can't see the visuals, but he was actually showing the arcade there.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.320
And there was lots of great machines there and folks in chat are noticing

10:17.000 --> 10:17.640
that as well.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.920
Uh, the tiger class has the F zero X run in the background.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.280
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.360
That's the actual speeder on those playing behind Bobby.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.920
But, um, you could actually see some of those arcade machines.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.560
I saw like a UB there's a DDR machine, but it was really spaced out.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.680
And I was like, wow.

10:30.680 --> 10:34.680
Are they still doing the COVID spacing that they were doing last year?

10:34.720 --> 10:38.320
Even, you know, now I know they are taking still a lot of COVID precautions.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.560
Like everybody in that audience who was not on stage was still masked.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.240
So that's, that's great that they're still, you know, taking those types of

10:44.280 --> 10:47.280
precautions, but I was a little surprised they didn't fill in the room more.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.440
However, what I'm told, and I am allowed to repeat this, apparently there's an

10:51.440 --> 10:56.440
anime convention going on across the street at a convention center and all of

10:56.440 --> 10:57.800
the machines are there.

10:58.080 --> 11:02.960
So as the anime convention finishes, they will then relocate over to summer

11:02.960 --> 11:03.880
games done quick.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.440
So what you saw in the video was really only about a quarter of what they plan

11:07.440 --> 11:10.920
on having there at summer games done quick, but you know, it's not really all

11:10.920 --> 11:14.880
about the arcade there on site because obviously all of us are participating on

11:14.880 --> 11:18.200
the internet and so forth, watching the various speed runs.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.840
I noticed there, we got to see that first Sonic run of the day was being played

11:21.840 --> 11:24.880
there and you could see kind of what that looked like there in studio.

11:24.880 --> 11:25.760
So that was really cool.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.440
So thanks very much.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.240
DJ Rama S says, what anime con?

11:30.240 --> 11:31.160
Anime Minneapolis?

11:31.160 --> 11:34.880
I guess, I don't know, but it's, he said it's at a convention center across the

11:34.880 --> 11:35.280
street.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.160
So yeah.

11:36.520 --> 11:40.440
Dark Tetsuya says, I did spot the theater at the arcade.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.840
Heck yeah, I saw that too.

11:41.840 --> 11:42.480
That's awesome.

11:43.040 --> 11:47.080
As J-100 Matt says, GDQ is a nerd bucket list thing to attend in person.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.960
Yeah, I think it would be a lot of fun as well.

11:48.960 --> 11:49.760
It's kind of a bummer.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.240
They seem to always do it at East Coast sites.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.800
I'd love if there was like a Vegas one or something was a little closer to our side,

11:55.800 --> 11:57.000
but it is what it is.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.640
I'd still love to get to one someday.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.920
Maybe not the whole week, but a few days just to enjoy it.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.280
And you know, cause I know that they apparently still do panels.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.440
I don't know if they're doing them this year.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.400
I would assume they are, you know, some of those types of things as well.

12:08.400 --> 12:13.160
So, but again, you can participate from the comfort of your own home.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.520
You just head on over to their channel over at Games Done Quick.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.840
And again, Bobby will be on the stream doing some announcing tomorrow morning

12:21.840 --> 12:24.360
and Tuesday morning, as he mentioned there in the message.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.080
So break a leg, Bobby Black Wolf.

12:26.400 --> 12:30.400
And if the convention does not break 3 million, then break the other leg as

12:30.400 --> 12:30.720
well.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.400
No, I'm just kidding.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.480
Every dollar raised is incredible for Doctors Without Borders.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.000
All right.

12:38.200 --> 12:42.000
Also, I do want to mention Bobby Black Wolf will be back next week to talk all

12:42.000 --> 12:47.200
about that because Bobby and us here at OLR, we do tape live every Sunday night.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.760
We are at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby

12:50.760 --> 12:53.640
Black Wolf show at eight o'clock Eastern, five o'clock Pacific here at the

12:53.640 --> 12:56.360
Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.480
That's V-O-G Network.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.520
And of course, you can chat along with us and our show just like folks are in our

13:01.520 --> 13:02.240
chat tonight.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.200
All right, moving on with gaming topics that happened throughout the week, we're

13:07.200 --> 13:11.520
going to get caught up on some of the news we missed last week, but there was a

13:11.520 --> 13:17.560
pretty big bombshell, I guess, drop this week on us, a little bit of a surprise

13:17.560 --> 13:18.440
announcement of sorts.

13:18.440 --> 13:18.760
I don't know.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.440
I thought it was kind of a surprise.

13:20.440 --> 13:24.560
It caught me off guard a little bit, but PlayStation announced one of their state

13:24.560 --> 13:30.040
of play announcements for Thursday, and they actually announced quite a bit of

13:30.040 --> 13:30.480
stuff here.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.680
I'm going to ask Loki to give us the rundown here in just a moment, but I mean,

13:33.680 --> 13:38.440
they even talked about new hardware, kind of, kind of, so we'll talk.

13:38.440 --> 13:43.040
Yeah, yeah, kind of, big, yeah, but we'll talk a little bit about that, but, you

13:43.040 --> 13:47.720
know, that was essentially, I mean, I don't know if that's their E3 replacement

13:47.720 --> 13:52.960
presentation, but it very well could have been, although rumor is on social media,

13:52.960 --> 13:56.760
this is however much you want to invest on social media rumors or not, take it or

13:56.760 --> 13:59.920
leave it, that they are planning another one for later in the summer.

14:00.160 --> 14:05.880
I would assume, I would say it would make sense to see something else July or

14:05.880 --> 14:11.200
August, but this is probably what we're getting in lieu of the early June E3

14:11.200 --> 14:13.720
timeframe announcements, but anything can happen.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.520
Anything's possible.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.080
It's still...

14:16.080 --> 14:20.640
Oh, but how about just, you know, E3 into the sun and rebrand it?

14:21.080 --> 14:26.600
Well, I mean, some would consider Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest is that, and

14:26.600 --> 14:31.520
I would assume Sony will probably drop a couple things at Summer Game Fest as

14:31.520 --> 14:34.320
well, I think, I think that's probably a guarantee.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.400
So there's still more to come, but we got a lot out of this.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.160
Loki, walk us through some of the big announcements here.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.640
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of big announcements at the, well, it wasn't

14:44.640 --> 14:46.760
really a state of play, it was a PlayStation Showcase.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.640
Oh, excuse me, pick, pick a fucking name and stick with it, y'all.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.480
Pick a name.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.000
Well, it's more of the, the different state of plays are a little bit shorter,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.440
whereas like the Showcase is like a much longer thing.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.040
Like the last time they did one was back in 2021.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.840
So things that they show.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.160
So it was an E3 replacement then, if they're calling it a showcase.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.520
Yeah, yeah, basically.

15:09.680 --> 15:14.280
So they had lots of game trailers and announcements, some brand

15:14.280 --> 15:15.920
new kind of live surface games.

15:15.920 --> 15:21.000
So we had fair game or yes, it's fair games with a dollar sign.

15:21.560 --> 15:26.240
It was, I guess, because punctuation makes everything more hardcore.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.000
Excuse me, hardcore exclamation point.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.560
It's OK. The dollar sign is to represent all the microtransactions, right?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.920
You want to be punctual with your punctuation?

15:36.920 --> 15:39.280
Yeah, I'm sure it's I'm sure the dollar signs just represent

15:39.280 --> 15:41.200
all the microtransactions in the game.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.000
But apparently it's about, I guess, groups of people who are robbing

15:45.440 --> 15:49.200
some sort of corporation or like industrial thing or something like that.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.080
It's just, I don't know, neat, neat looking.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.600
It's going to be coming out on PlayStation five and PC.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.960
We had a was this the game from Jade Raymond Studio?

15:59.280 --> 16:01.960
I think I think that was the other big deal around.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.800
This was this was the Jade Raymond Studio game.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.120
Was it? I don't know.

16:06.120 --> 16:06.920
I believe so.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.440
What studio was it? It was.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.960
Yeah, it is Haven Studios.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.880
Yep. OK, so that's that's the other reason

16:16.880 --> 16:20.600
this is kind of bumped up, because, you know, her influence

16:20.600 --> 16:22.320
has a lot of clout in the industry.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.360
So people are very curious what she's been up to since

16:26.040 --> 16:27.840
she came and went from Stadia.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.240
I don't think she ended up doing anything at Stadia, honestly,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.800
but I don't blame her the way that whole ship sailed.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.520
So, yeah, good for her.

16:37.360 --> 16:42.800
Sorry, you know, all the Stadia shade is directed at a Mr.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.360
Phil Harrison. That's it.

16:44.360 --> 16:48.120
Mm hmm. Anyway, bring in the Shadia. Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.120
So what else we had?

16:52.120 --> 16:55.360
I think there's some additional shooter games that they had as well.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.840
Helldivers two look pretty cool.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.280
That's not a shooter, though.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.600
That's a top down third person.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.680
Well, I guess it's still a third person shooter,

17:05.280 --> 17:08.360
but I guess this one is.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.960
Yeah, it's going to be a third person shooter, whereas the original was

17:10.960 --> 17:12.760
like a top down shooter.

17:12.760 --> 17:13.920
So it looks a little bit different.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.800
I thought it looked kind of cool, actually.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.120
I never played the original.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.120
What else? So Ghostrunner two looked pretty awesome.

17:21.120 --> 17:25.160
So it took the kind of like wall running and like futuristic cyberpunk

17:25.560 --> 17:27.160
swordplay from the original game

17:27.160 --> 17:30.240
and added a motorcycle because that is just awesome.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.880
You know, I love the idea of riding a motorcycle

17:33.880 --> 17:36.760
down a giant like cyberpunk building.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.400
And apparently it's something you can do in the game.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.320
So looks cool.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.520
So it's now a Biden ghost writer.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.160
Kind of a little bit, a little, a little bit,

17:49.160 --> 17:53.400
a little bit of spirit of vengeance and heads being on fire. Right.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.280
What else? So we have it.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.280
Immortals of Avium,

17:58.280 --> 18:03.680
which is a first person wizard combat game, look kind of neat.

18:03.720 --> 18:08.520
Yeah, I have to say, as much as I'm concerned, because this game is an EA game

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
and that means it's going to be,

18:09.520 --> 18:12.600
you know, loot box, microtransaction city and all that stuff.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.520
I have to say this game gives me big hex and vibes.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.640
And I am kind of here for that.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.640
Like, I'm going to give EA.

18:23.200 --> 18:23.760
We can't hear you.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.920
I accidentally brushed the mic and muted myself.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.520
It's giving me big hex and vibes.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.080
So please do not let me down EA.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.280
Leaving you speechless.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.240
Yeah. Yes, exactly that.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.160
Sigh. Can I not have audio problems tonight?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.360
I take one week, one week.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.560
And it all breaks.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.080
Well, it's been Phantom Blade zero.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.640
It's a third person action game.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.080
That's kind of along the lines of like Ghost of Tsushima.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.920
And let's see what else.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.000
This one's pretty cool.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.280
So there is a game called Sword of the Sea.

18:59.720 --> 19:05.080
It's like a it has definitely journey vibes

19:05.080 --> 19:07.760
because I guess it's from the former team that did Journey.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.840
Pathless and Abzu.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.400
And it looks pretty awesome as you like skating on this like hovers

19:15.400 --> 19:17.720
surfboard thing over the sands and stuff like that

19:18.520 --> 19:20.920
through half pipes and stuff like that, and even have like dolphins

19:20.920 --> 19:21.680
flying through the air.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.600
So OK, crazy visuals.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.840
I definitely see the Journey vibes from this whole thing.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.960
So but it's not the same studio, right?

19:29.960 --> 19:34.200
It's just some of the same talent that the developers that worked on the game.

19:34.200 --> 19:38.400
OK. You know, honestly, that that's a pretty strong resume.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.600
That's enough for me to check it out.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.480
It does look really pretty.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.040
And it's cool because the thing that you're surfing on is your sword.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.680
So well, it looks a lot like the Journey scarf, to be honest.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.120
There's I feel like there's a lot in common.

19:52.160 --> 19:55.240
Wouldn't it be would it be neat if it was like in the same universe or something?

19:55.240 --> 19:58.800
I mean, not not that every game has to be like a direct sequel

19:58.800 --> 20:01.800
or influence to something else, but it certainly looks similar.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.240
I love it when there's like a little tie in at the end, like, you know,

20:05.840 --> 20:09.280
spoiler alert, but like at the end of Final Destination 5,

20:09.280 --> 20:12.640
they're boarding the flight from the original movie twist.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.480
You know, it's just it's it's fun. I don't know, whatever.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.480
I haven't seen any of those movies.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.400
They're they're disgusting, but I get forced to watch them anyway.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.200
I used to watch them all the time, and then they stopped after

20:25.200 --> 20:27.120
I don't remember how many sequels.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.280
All right. Anyway,

20:29.320 --> 20:32.280
the Talos Principle two looks pretty awesome.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.120
One that was one of those games.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.880
I think I have it in my library, but I need to check it out.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.920
But puzzle first person shooter game looks pretty awesome.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.640
Niva, which is from the folks that did

20:47.040 --> 20:49.360
Gris sequel to Greece, Greece.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.360
Yeah. And that's supposed to be coming out next year.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.840
I don't know much about this game, Dark Soccer.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.160
What what what's Gris?

20:57.160 --> 21:00.720
It's a puzzle game where about a girl battling her depression.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.160
Oh, wow. I feel like now that you bring that up, I feel like I like

21:04.520 --> 21:07.360
saw that, but I don't think I ever played it, but that's OK.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.440
But I'm here for the giant antler wolf, so, you know.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.040
Of course. I mean, this is the same system that runs The Last Guardian.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.320
So, you know, good times.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.600
Yeah, it looks very pretty.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.440
We had Cat Quest, Pirates of Perobeen.

21:22.800 --> 21:28.000
The Perobeen, the get out.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.040
It's really called the Perobeen.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.600
Yes. So Cat Quest, Pirates of the Perobeen.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.360
Why would anyone be surprised?

21:36.800 --> 21:41.360
Honestly, go off like if you're going to do it,

21:41.640 --> 21:46.600
if you're going to do something like Cat Quest, go big like just do it.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.400
I love it. That's like pretty sweet.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.760
And then there's this one from Square Enix.

21:52.760 --> 21:56.200
It's an it's another live service game from Square Enix.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.440
Oh, is it totally going to fail?

21:58.440 --> 22:03.360
But so it's a game that people are comparing it to like Splatoon.

22:04.360 --> 22:09.080
Yeah, this is just basically Splatoon on the PS5, and I'm totally here for it.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.520
I'm sorry. It's called Foam Stars.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.320
And you like shoot foam everywhere and do things with foam

22:14.320 --> 22:16.120
and all that kind of stuff.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.120
And it's got

22:18.200 --> 22:23.120
TV anime people in it and not ska music, but that's OK.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.920
It's not ink. It's it's foam.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.480
It's a dark sakura.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.480
That's exactly how the pitch went in my mind.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.360
It's one of those foam parties that I guess are big and like, you know.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.800
Let's just put it this way, though.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.400
Nobody jumps off and, you know, breaks their leg or something.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.480
Square Enix has a track record with live service games.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.920
That is not good. Yeah, that's that's fair.

22:51.080 --> 22:51.760
I will say this.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.000
And look, I'm not I'm not here to like say Splatoon is bad or anything.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.080
Of course it's not.

22:56.080 --> 23:00.880
But how many times have you played a Nintendo title and gone like, man,

23:01.080 --> 23:04.840
this would be even better if it like had the PlayStation

23:04.840 --> 23:07.360
or Xbox series kind of power behind it.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.360
And now that's kind of like what they're doing with this.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.960
But yes, there's there's every right to be concerned

23:13.960 --> 23:17.720
that there's going to be, you know, microtransaction hell

23:17.720 --> 23:22.600
or it's going to be a little bit, you know, wonkier than, you know, Splatoon.

23:22.840 --> 23:26.560
You know, Nintendo does put a lot of time into the quality of their games

23:26.560 --> 23:28.360
and there's something to be said about that.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.200
So totally, totally fair, to be honest.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.760
But I'm sure I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.240
There was a whole period in the NES era when Tengen did it better.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.720
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.520
I like how they go from like the CG part of the trailer to the gameplay,

23:44.520 --> 23:48.640
and you're like, oh, it's like massively like

23:49.440 --> 23:52.840
not as good as the CG part.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.680
It's like, oh, this just looks pretty plain.

23:57.720 --> 24:02.400
SSJ 100 Matt says this is like vanilla ice trying to say that ice ice baby

24:02.400 --> 24:04.200
is different from under pressure.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.640
Yeah, exactly. Exactly right.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.280
More than 50% change.

24:09.280 --> 24:13.640
Pirate Pound Town says get clean by playing dirty.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.440
Orange Wright suggests the name bubble bath battlers.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.680
Wait, that might be a bad name.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.240
Yeah, don't don't call your game bubble bath babes

24:22.240 --> 24:25.600
because people will think it's a completely different game from the NES era.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.000
You can Google that, but it's NSFW just leaving that out there.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.720
Anyhow. Yeah, it looks interesting.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.080
I don't know. Neat.

24:37.080 --> 24:40.160
We've got another trailer trailer for the plucky squire,

24:40.680 --> 24:45.800
and it's a that RPG game that takes place like books.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.360
And then you kind of kind of has a was it the

24:51.160 --> 24:55.280
was it that gameplay element from the Legend of Zelda

24:55.960 --> 25:01.160
in between worlds where you kind of like kind of go squish to like flat.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.280
And so you're yeah, you go to D.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.760
So kind of like that, I guess.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.840
Mario Odyssey is similar.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.080
Looks pretty sweet.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.280
Console version of Teardown is coming.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.440
That game is pretty awesome.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.120
It's kind of a voxel heist game

25:14.400 --> 25:18.080
and very, very cool because it's all physics based.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.880
You can destroy buildings and all sorts of crazy stuff.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.200
So cool that that's coming to consoles.

25:25.200 --> 25:30.960
The rumored Metal Gear Solid three Snake Eater remake is a thing now,

25:30.960 --> 25:33.560
and it's coming to the PlayStation five.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.680
I think maybe even other platforms as well.

25:37.840 --> 25:42.080
No word on when that's coming, but it is something that is in development.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.360
I mean, yeah, that is neat.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.200
I'm not not mad at that at all.

25:46.200 --> 25:50.920
But is it a little weird that it's three and not one or two?

25:51.400 --> 25:56.040
Like, wouldn't you want to do it was one of the best in the series, I guess.

25:56.040 --> 26:00.320
Yeah. And I guess to be fair, like Silent Hill two is getting a remake.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.560
So maybe it's just one of those.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.400
They're remaking some of the PlayStation two era actually wasn't.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.440
I can't remember. Was Metal Gear Solid three a PS two game or a PS three game?

26:09.520 --> 26:11.080
This is a PS two game, wasn't it?

26:11.080 --> 26:14.160
So then maybe they're maybe they're remaking the PS two era games

26:14.160 --> 26:17.280
for whatever reason, had the most epic song.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.520
The song better be intact.

26:20.160 --> 26:23.320
It's in the trailer, so I'm assuming it's good. Good.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.000
Good, good. Because sometimes you feed on a tree fog

26:28.160 --> 26:31.400
because they they they, of course, after like teasing everything

26:31.400 --> 26:34.080
because they don't really show you what what the trailer is for.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.520
Initially, it's just a bunch of animals and stuff.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.120
And then you see snake and then the music comes in.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.720
It's like, yeah.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.200
A couple of comments in chat on some of these things we're talking about,

26:44.200 --> 26:46.200
but some really good feedback here in chat.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.720
Tiger Claus pointing out Sony's copied Nintendo several times.

26:49.720 --> 26:53.360
Remember PlayStation All Stars, which is a clone of Smash Brothers?

26:53.640 --> 26:57.600
Yeah. And sadly, it wasn't quite as good, but that's not to say it was bad.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.080
That game definitely had their fans.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.040
And there's a lot of people they did with it.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.800
A lot of people would love to see another one of those games, to be quite honest.

27:03.800 --> 27:07.320
So I like how it like it combined like the backgrounds combined

27:07.320 --> 27:10.640
like two different games together and they kind of like

27:10.640 --> 27:12.840
there is stuff that went along with that.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.600
So I think that was pretty sweet.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.320
And I wish like we would get that a little bit more with like Smash Brothers

27:18.320 --> 27:22.120
where instead of having like, say, a Kirby level,

27:22.120 --> 27:25.320
you could have a Kirby level and then like Zelda stuff,

27:25.320 --> 27:29.360
like kind of mashing together almost like in the stuff interacting.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.920
It'd be really cool.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.560
Fixation Gaze in chat says,

27:33.560 --> 27:37.160
Does Sony not have their own ideas or do they need to copy others homework?

27:37.720 --> 27:39.960
To be fair, I mean, I get I totally get that perspective.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.600
It's Square Enix. That is true.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.440
It's a Square Enix game.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.520
But and certainly Square Enix has plenty of their own ideas,

27:45.520 --> 27:47.960
even though, you know, they've made one game 16 times.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.960
But they are all different.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.160
They seem completely original.

27:51.160 --> 27:57.040
Yeah. But also, you know, Sony is, you know, God of War and Last of Us.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.760
They do they have the bandwidth to be able to do their own stuff, too.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.080
But that is a good point that technically it's Square Enix

28:03.080 --> 28:05.200
that's bringing it to Sony.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.080
Yeah. And they all you know what?

28:07.080 --> 28:09.320
You know what? If you think about sorry, I don't mean to cut you off.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.880
But if you think about what Splatoon was anyway,

28:12.880 --> 28:15.520
I mean, Splatoon was kind of a derivative idea.

28:15.840 --> 28:19.240
If you think about it, it's just that it was the very Nintendo cutesy

28:19.240 --> 28:22.880
way of doing a shooter and doing, you know, one of those more competitive

28:22.880 --> 28:23.920
types of games.

28:23.920 --> 28:27.440
And, you know, so was Splatoon itself a really original idea?

28:27.680 --> 28:28.880
Eh, not really.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.040
But Nintendo has their way of putting their own polish on everything.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.840
So, you know, there's a lot of video games that are derivative

28:34.840 --> 28:37.600
of something else, but they perfect the formula.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.920
They make it better. Right.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.520
So you can tell when you get your hands on the game.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.920
I think that's, you know, obviously going to be the key.

28:44.920 --> 28:49.400
Is this just a rip off or is this, you know, oh, it's an evolution,

28:49.520 --> 28:52.160
because I would say there's a big difference between those two types of games,

28:52.160 --> 28:53.320
an evolution and a rip off.

28:54.920 --> 28:59.840
Anyhow, we had a game show called Towers of Gospa,

29:00.240 --> 29:03.560
and it looks pretty sweet, pretty epic, kind of reminds me a bit

29:03.560 --> 29:07.440
of Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, at least with the verticality to it.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.520
They show these giant,

29:10.040 --> 29:13.800
I guess they're like salmon or catfish or something like that,

29:13.800 --> 29:17.120
giant flying catfish that you can actually land on

29:17.120 --> 29:20.280
and collect things from and stuff like that and fighting monsters.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.840
So kind of a little Monster Hunter vibe to it as well.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.080
That looks pretty sweet.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.760
We had another trailer for Final Fantasy 16.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.920
So, you know.

29:31.720 --> 29:35.560
Cool. I actually I purposely think all the characters

29:35.560 --> 29:38.160
just look the same after a while.

29:38.160 --> 29:42.600
I purposely did not watch the 16 trailer because I'm

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
I don't want to oversaturate at this point.

29:44.600 --> 29:49.040
I want to just wait for the game to come out and play it.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.240
I just have a hard time watching them now, just because I mean,

29:53.600 --> 29:58.120
seriously, their characters have no variation between modern iterations now.

29:58.240 --> 30:02.560
Yeah. Like, oh, all the all the the dark haired women look like Tifa.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.080
Like, seriously, it's just they

30:07.640 --> 30:10.040
their style isn't exciting anymore.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.760
It's pretty.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.520
Well, they're just not as like memorable like I think like Noctis or whatever.

30:16.520 --> 30:21.640
I'm not really enthralled with the group from like 15 even.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.960
Well, and you can even go back to like something like Final Fantasy 12,

30:25.960 --> 30:28.520
where pretty much every character in that game was forgettable,

30:28.520 --> 30:30.400
except for Balthier and Fran.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.200
When you talk about Final Fantasy 12, that's all anybody wants to talk about.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.880
And I'm sure somebody out there in chat is like, but I love Piniello,

30:36.880 --> 30:41.720
but realize that most people could give a shit about any of the characters

30:41.720 --> 30:46.160
in those games besides Balthier and Fran, who were the stars of that game.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.320
Period. Well, I'll also say this.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.480
I tried to play the game and got really bored with it. So.

30:53.400 --> 30:58.720
Yeah, I don't think I've had fun in a Final Fantasy game since like.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.400
Part of eight.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.040
And of course, the MMOs.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.600
Yeah, and I'm going sequentially because I still think

31:08.600 --> 31:11.120
that Final Fantasy five is like the best of them.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.680
Yeah, and I you know, again, I didn't hate 15,

31:14.680 --> 31:17.200
but there was a lot of room for improvement in 15.

31:17.200 --> 31:22.480
And I just it was not near 15 was not as good as 13 to me.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.760
10 and 10 to got. Yeah, I could.

31:25.760 --> 31:29.480
I borrowed your copy of 13, the first one, and I got kind of bored.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.640
It is lightning needed personality.

31:32.640 --> 31:38.360
It it I it's a fair criticism that Final Fantasy 13 takes 20 hours to get going.

31:38.880 --> 31:43.600
It's a completely fair criticism, but I also kind of see to me

31:43.640 --> 31:47.360
like there's certain TV shows that are the same way.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.000
It's until it's not until the end of the first season

31:50.000 --> 31:52.200
where things finally start to fucking escalate.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.000
And that's how Final Fantasy 13 was.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.520
And I think that's that's what kind of broke the deal for a lot of people.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.440
And I get it. So.

31:58.440 --> 32:01.880
But I'm still I'm so excited for the lightning to actually be worthy

32:01.880 --> 32:02.960
of being a main character.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.600
And I know I should have played more and I know she got better.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.960
Yeah, but you know, but she she also gets upstaged by some of the supporting cast.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.240
Like once you get Fang,

32:11.240 --> 32:14.400
Fang is a incredible character that I sort of wish was explored

32:14.400 --> 32:15.360
more in the follow ups.

32:15.360 --> 32:20.200
She's there, but not nearly as much so because of things that happen in 13

32:20.200 --> 32:23.160
dodging spoilers of a very old game. All right.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.760
Anyhow, sorry, Loki.

32:26.760 --> 32:27.640
That's right.

32:27.640 --> 32:32.120
We had a game game play trailer for Alan Wake two, which looks pretty awesome.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.440
And that's how we have October 17th.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.440
They announced the next Assassin's Creed game,

32:40.440 --> 32:44.280
so we have Assassin's Creed Mirage making the full transition

32:44.280 --> 32:46.560
right back to Prince of Persia again. So

32:48.200 --> 32:49.440
it looks interesting.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.680
I'm OK with that.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.720
Revenant Hill, which is looking forward to this.

32:56.120 --> 33:00.040
Yeah, I guess it's a game developed by Glory Society

33:00.600 --> 33:03.520
where you play a cat named Twigs.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.040
Who is a trying to become a witch's familiar.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.320
That sounds fun.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.400
Yeah, it's pretty fun looking.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.040
I like the art style in it.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.080
It gives me kind of limbo vibes, but.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.440
With a little more with a little splash of color to it.

33:21.640 --> 33:25.440
Yes, I know cat games have been doing very well for Sony,

33:25.440 --> 33:27.920
like everybody lost their fucking mind about Stray.

33:28.120 --> 33:31.040
And now what? Now we get a cat quest sequel,

33:31.040 --> 33:32.760
although that game was everywhere, to be fair.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.960
And you know, now this cat games are going to be all the rage.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.840
And I better not hear a single damn one of you complaining about it

33:38.880 --> 33:41.680
because this is this is a great thing for games.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.080
And that's on period.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.800
There's a trailer for Grand Blue Fantasy Relink,

33:47.920 --> 33:50.800
which is out this winter,

33:51.000 --> 33:56.440
and it is the next entry into the Grand Blue Fantasy series, I guess.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.440
So cool looking JRPG there.

34:00.800 --> 34:04.840
Street Fighter six had a new trailer and.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.960
That game is out this week.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.120
There are there are two heavy, heavy hitters for the year out this week.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.640
Diablo for Street Fighter six.

34:15.640 --> 34:20.000
This is this is a big week for games, you know, going into what would have been

34:20.000 --> 34:23.120
E3 week, essentially the week after, well, maybe two weeks.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.680
But still, it's summer is here, that's for sure.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.480
But yeah, Street Fighter six looks awesome.

34:28.480 --> 34:33.080
Like if I didn't know that, like all of my time would be spent on Diablo

34:33.080 --> 34:35.920
until Final Fantasy 16 is out and then all my time will be spent on that.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.880
I would get Street Fighter six right away.

34:37.880 --> 34:42.200
But as it stands, I'm like, maybe if I can write it out till Black Friday,

34:42.200 --> 34:44.160
I'll get it on a sale.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.200
I know we're interested in it, to be honest.

34:46.200 --> 34:50.480
I kind of only want to play Street Fighter six because of the little like

34:51.280 --> 34:53.880
single player, like story mode or whatever,

34:53.880 --> 34:58.600
because it reminds me a lot of like kind of the demo was great.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.640
Yeah. Like was it the like a dragon stuff?

35:02.680 --> 35:05.640
Oh, yeah. Like kind of weird.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.040
It does have a bit of that. Yeah.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.800
So I'm kind of wanting to check it out because of that.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.160
I'll catch it on sale, probably.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.640
But yeah, it looks interesting.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.720
We had a game called Ultros.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.600
Not really the final fans. So good.

35:21.600 --> 35:25.800
But it's like a kind of a they compared to like a like a black like

35:26.800 --> 35:29.520
1960s concert poster come to life.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.200
It looks like it's very like this is why Dark Soccer likes it.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.120
It looks like pinball.

35:33.160 --> 35:36.000
It looks like a pinball, well, not the game, but the artwork on a pinball machine.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.680
It looks like a 60s pinball.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.760
But that's not.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.640
But I'm leaning more toward like those

35:43.600 --> 35:47.200
late 60s, early to mid 70s psychedelic posters.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.920
And those are just like.

35:49.920 --> 35:53.760
The colors are vibrant and they're garish,

35:53.760 --> 35:56.480
but they work well in that style.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.960
So I really just dig the inspiration behind it.

36:00.960 --> 36:01.760
And it's really good.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.160
I mean, we're not sick of Metroidvanias yet, right?

36:04.160 --> 36:06.800
We're down for another one in the, you know, actually.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.760
Eliminate the term.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.120
Eliminate the term Metroidvania.

36:11.120 --> 36:14.160
Yeah, I mean, it's a platformer.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.080
End of story is exploratory platformer.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.760
Action platformer.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.160
A plant former?

36:20.160 --> 36:22.120
No, I said an action platformer.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.960
I thought you said platformer

36:23.960 --> 36:27.200
based on the art, and I was going to laugh, but I guess I shouldn't.

36:27.440 --> 36:30.400
No, action platformer or like,

36:30.440 --> 36:34.400
I don't know, like games like that have existed for well before.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.640
Yeah. Symphony of the night.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.040
Yeah. Before Metroid they existed.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.120
I mean, I guess in some ways, adventure on the 2600

36:44.120 --> 36:44.880
was kind of like that.

36:44.880 --> 36:48.280
So anyway, Dragon's Dogma 2.

36:48.840 --> 36:54.080
So that's Capcom's action RPG game finally coming out.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.680
The sequel at least played some of the first one.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.560
It was all right.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.840
Yeah, I think that was one of those games that had the DLC on disk,

37:02.840 --> 37:04.920
if I remember correctly, way back in the day.

37:04.920 --> 37:09.440
Not a problem anymore, because, you know, I just played it on Mac on my

37:09.680 --> 37:11.640
well, at the time on my PC.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.640
Yeah, they released that game everywhere.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.040
So but it definitely has its fans.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.440
So I know this is getting some people excited.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.760
I like some of the character design looks looks neat.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.160
They showed off more stuff for PlayStation VR, too.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.600
So a few things. Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted Two

37:27.840 --> 37:30.560
is going to be coming to the console as well.

37:30.760 --> 37:34.080
Resident Evil 4 VR mode had a trailer for that.

37:34.600 --> 37:39.440
Arizona Sunshine Two, which is coming out this spring on PlayStation VR

37:39.440 --> 37:43.640
two and PC. Crossfire Sierra Squad,

37:44.280 --> 37:46.920
which is going to be like a PlayStation two

37:47.000 --> 37:49.480
or PlayStation VR two version of the game,

37:50.920 --> 37:52.560
which that looks kind of cool.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.160
Synapse, which we saw a trailer for this before.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.600
I don't remember where exactly,

37:56.600 --> 37:59.560
but this is going to be coming out

37:59.560 --> 38:02.560
actually July 4th. Looks pretty cool.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.520
It looks like a really neat game.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.600
I just wish it wasn't directly first person.

38:06.640 --> 38:09.240
Let me just jump in real quick on Five Nights at Freddy's,

38:09.240 --> 38:11.440
because there's a great comment from Tiger Claw in chat.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.280
Five Nights at Freddy's fans are eating good this week.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.320
A teaser trailer for the movie adaptation got released.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.640
It sure did. That looked pretty good.

38:19.960 --> 38:23.760
So then the next day, a trailer for the ruined DLC for Security

38:23.760 --> 38:26.840
Breach was released, then out of left field here in the PlayStation.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.560
So you get a sequel to the VR game help wanted to

38:30.160 --> 38:31.920
assumeably about the sister location.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.720
So, yeah, it was it was a good week to be a Freddy fan, that's for sure.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.360
Beat Saber's coming to PlayStation VR two,

38:40.360 --> 38:43.760
which I honestly thought it already was, but they're going to be also

38:43.760 --> 38:46.400
throwing in a queen themed music pack,

38:46.760 --> 38:49.760
which I hope is available on all platforms because, you know,

38:50.080 --> 38:53.440
the trailers don't don't stop me now. Yeah.

38:54.440 --> 38:58.280
And I was also surprised Beat Saber wasn't already on PSVR two.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.320
I think it had been announced, but I think

39:01.560 --> 39:04.920
I think now it's it's just it's out now, basically.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.920
So by the way, if you bought the original on PS4,

39:07.920 --> 39:10.160
you can download the new one for free. That was kind of cool.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.880
I saw except I don't have a PSVR two, so it does me no good.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.520
But yeah, that's that's probably the whole thing.

39:17.520 --> 39:21.760
Sony wants me to get one now that I already have a game available to play on it.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.880
But here's the thing, like with the PlayStation VR stuff,

39:25.880 --> 39:30.000
like Sony still didn't show any first party PlayStation VR game. Yeah.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.760
It's like third party stuff.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.480
And a lot of this stuff is just like.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.240
Cool, Beat Saber.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.480
That's not system seller.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.680
That's on everything like, you know, cool Arizona sunshine.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.160
I mean, that's also on like most VR platforms.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.480
I would agree that this was good

39:48.520 --> 39:51.720
and Sony needed to show some VR stuff

39:51.720 --> 39:55.320
to show that they're sustaining PSVR two.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.640
But you're absolutely right.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.320
We need something first party.

39:58.320 --> 40:01.840
And quite frankly, PSVR two needs its half life, Alex.

40:02.720 --> 40:06.120
Like it needs a game of like that caliber that is exclusive

40:06.120 --> 40:09.520
to the platform to really, I think, woo more people there.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.720
I just don't think that's there yet.

40:10.720 --> 40:14.480
I know they're saying the sales figures, but I can't help

40:14.480 --> 40:16.800
but feel like some things are getting twisted to make that work.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.840
Or maybe it's selling better in other countries.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.240
I don't know. But I again,

40:22.240 --> 40:26.160
I just don't feel like the catalog is really there yet.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.600
But maybe there'll be a surprise for the holidays. Who knows?

40:31.800 --> 40:34.320
Yeah. And then talk about out of nowhere.

40:34.320 --> 40:38.520
So Bungie announced that they're making a new marathon game.

40:40.360 --> 40:43.680
That looked really stylish and cool, to be honest.

40:43.680 --> 40:47.520
It also looks like it has nothing to do with the original.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.680
You have some sort of combo running man battle royale.

40:54.920 --> 40:59.000
Yeah. But I'm, you know, I'm curious.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.080
That's that's a pretty big thing to revive your oldest IP,

41:02.080 --> 41:03.320
basically, and bring it back.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.560
I think that's very interesting.

41:05.560 --> 41:09.480
But I figure this game is probably still like at least two years away, probably.

41:09.480 --> 41:12.520
So nothing to get excited about in the near term.

41:14.400 --> 41:18.320
Destiny two, the final shape is going to be the next

41:18.320 --> 41:22.400
and apparently last big expansion for the game.

41:22.960 --> 41:26.800
So looking forward to those Destiny three trailers next year, I guess.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.080
So that's going to be a thing that's coming out.

41:31.080 --> 41:36.160
Concord, which is a game by Firewalk Studios.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.520
And I don't know.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.920
It looks somewhat interesting.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.560
Not really sure about it because they don't really show too much of it.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.000
Sorry, some audio.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.480
I just see that whole part with them launching out

41:50.480 --> 41:52.680
and it makes me think they've gone to plaid.

41:54.200 --> 41:57.240
I like the like logo treatment that they did there.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.240
But yeah, twenty twenty four.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.840
So cool.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.280
And then we get to some strange things.

42:05.280 --> 42:11.640
So Project Q, which is Sony's answer to it's not really streaming.

42:12.520 --> 42:16.000
So are like it's not like this competing against the steam deck,

42:16.000 --> 42:20.360
but sort of kind of is it is a handheld device that's

42:21.320 --> 42:25.840
based off of streaming games from your PlayStation console via remote play.

42:27.880 --> 42:32.720
Which. I don't.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.120
It's not the PlayStation switch, though, it's basically just like it's like

42:39.120 --> 42:41.000
you can do this on your phone already.

42:41.040 --> 42:45.320
In fact, we even sell like peripherals play that to do this.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.920
But like, I don't know, it just looks ugly.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.640
It looks weird.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.440
I don't like it. I don't like it.

42:51.440 --> 42:56.120
Jamie, I don't like PlayStation five earbuds.

42:56.520 --> 43:01.520
I, I actually I'm not quite as negative as you're feeling, Loki.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.960
I, I understand why something like this exists,

43:05.360 --> 43:08.240
especially in those households where

43:08.560 --> 43:13.120
mom or dad wants to use the TV to watch whatever.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.200
And so you can play your game on this.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.760
I would say this is Sony's version of the Wii U in a way.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.760
It's the play deck.

43:22.760 --> 43:23.520
Yeah. Or that. Yeah.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.520
I mean, yeah, the steam deck, you know, play deck or whatever you want to say.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.880
I think in a way it's that.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.960
I think there could be something to say here.

43:30.960 --> 43:34.840
Like, I think it could be very cool to do the whole like,

43:34.920 --> 43:39.280
I'm going to tap into my PlayStation five while I'm in another city.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.760
So like, for example, I was on San Diego for a work trip last week.

43:42.760 --> 43:43.880
That's why I wasn't here on the show.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.880
That would have been neat to have a device like this,

43:47.240 --> 43:51.040
that I could tap into my PlayStation five. Although Loki, you're fair,

43:51.040 --> 43:51.520
what you said,

43:51.520 --> 43:53.880
you can already do this on your mobile phone if you just have the right little

43:53.880 --> 43:57.600
clip for it. So, you know, but taking that a step.

43:57.600 --> 43:58.960
You can be able to do that with Stadia.

43:59.120 --> 44:02.640
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Taking this a step further and doing this sort of thing,

44:02.640 --> 44:05.240
but it's not even cloud.

44:05.240 --> 44:09.200
It's your PlayStation five that you're able to tap into on the internet.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.640
Can you do it from a distance or do you have to be on the same network for that?

44:12.640 --> 44:17.000
Because I remember that they have, you know, remote play.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.600
When they talk about remote play, my expectation is that it's over the internet,

44:20.600 --> 44:23.480
but I guess I could be wrong. If it's not over the internet,

44:23.480 --> 44:27.320
then I forget what I'm saying here. I don't see the point of this device then.

44:27.640 --> 44:31.560
But if it does it over the internet, then I think, you know, especially again,

44:31.560 --> 44:34.160
as 5g gains more popularity,

44:35.080 --> 44:38.320
there's going to be a space for this. But my concern is,

44:38.320 --> 44:41.960
as Sony does this a lot, if they release it too early,

44:42.840 --> 44:45.560
I'm not sure it's going to sell a ton right out the gate,

44:45.560 --> 44:48.760
and then they're going to give up on it before it could reach its prime.

44:49.680 --> 44:53.360
Yeah, it says you can use PlayStation remote play.

44:53.360 --> 44:56.560
It says when connected to broadband network or mobile data.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.640
So it says you can do it.

44:58.640 --> 45:01.760
My question is, like, if you're going to buy a console for remote play,

45:01.760 --> 45:05.360
I mean, just buy a Steam Deck because it's compatible with PC.

45:05.960 --> 45:08.800
You could probably play this on a Steam Deck already.

45:09.080 --> 45:13.920
Why would I want to buy a device that only works with the PlayStation five?

45:14.480 --> 45:19.000
And is I mean, we don't even know how expensive it is yet. So.

45:20.120 --> 45:23.160
It's probably at least a few hundred dollars, so why bother?

45:23.160 --> 45:23.920
Like, I don't know.

45:23.920 --> 45:27.440
It's yeah, it's got to be priced competitively with a Steam Deck for sure.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.680
The consoles just haven't had much interesting if it's

45:31.920 --> 45:34.120
unless it's the switch is just.

45:35.960 --> 45:38.640
I almost think they're trying too hard with this one.

45:38.640 --> 45:41.240
They're seeing, oh, everyone else has had success with this.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.200
Why don't we try it too late?

45:43.960 --> 45:46.160
The one thing I will say is that, you know, remember,

45:46.160 --> 45:49.720
you can also do other things with your PlayStation in the multimedia world.

45:49.720 --> 45:51.960
But to be fair, it's nothing you can't do with your phone

45:52.080 --> 45:55.200
when it comes to things like streaming services and, you know, movies

45:55.200 --> 45:57.840
and things like that, it's nothing you can't already do with your phone.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.960
I I don't know.

45:59.960 --> 46:03.480
I think this could be interesting, but not not if it's too expensive.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.320
So, yeah, we need more details on this for sure.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.040
I wish I wish PlayStation would just do another dedicated handheld,

46:09.040 --> 46:11.200
but I get why they're hesitant to.

46:13.080 --> 46:18.240
Yeah. And then finally, we got a new trailer for Marvel's Spider-Man two,

46:18.440 --> 46:23.280
which is obviously a big game from Insomniac and one of the things that

46:24.280 --> 46:28.000
Sony is very proud to show off for the PlayStation five.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.040
Well, it's the holiday tent pole, basically.

46:30.040 --> 46:32.200
So this is, you know, the biggest game, basically,

46:32.520 --> 46:35.920
at least for as far as Sony sees it for the for the fall.

46:36.120 --> 46:38.040
So I get it. Yeah.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.560
And they show off Peter using, I guess, the dark venom suit,

46:41.560 --> 46:46.960
as well as we see Miles Morales and some of his abilities as well.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.640
So come out this fall. Awesome.

46:50.520 --> 46:51.400
All right.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.640
So PlayStation Showcase, very busy.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.800
I mean, if you think about it, that was a lot.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.280
That was like that was like 20 titles you just went over.

46:59.280 --> 47:02.680
So there's there's a lot going on here.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.920
So it's going to be an interesting year for Sony.

47:04.920 --> 47:05.840
And it's going to be interesting

47:05.840 --> 47:09.800
to see what Microsoft has ready to go in response in a couple of weeks.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.280
And maybe Nintendo.

47:12.280 --> 47:14.920
I mean, Nintendo is definitely the wild card in the room right now

47:14.920 --> 47:17.560
because we we literally do not know what happens now.

47:17.800 --> 47:22.040
You know, Zelda, of course, still has many people's attention. I get it.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.800
But what comes in six months? We don't know.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.920
So there's kind of an expectation there.

47:26.920 --> 47:30.400
Nintendo is going to tell us soon what's next. What's after Zelda?

47:31.080 --> 47:34.560
So I can't wait until we actually sit down with it,

47:34.560 --> 47:37.360
because I've seen all kinds of fun things that people made.

47:37.800 --> 47:41.000
Someone has officially made a yacht.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.200
I like somebody did like a death trap type of thing

47:44.200 --> 47:46.400
that they were putting the mobs in, like a cage.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.040
They would slam down on the mobs.

47:48.040 --> 47:50.840
It would just like electrocute them over. And I thought it was very funny.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.880
Oh, I saw this awesome one where someone had flamethrowers

47:54.880 --> 47:56.600
that went out in a circle.

47:56.600 --> 48:00.280
And so once everything was lit up, they'd, you know, use the updraft

48:00.280 --> 48:04.960
to to rise up above everything and then watch from above

48:05.360 --> 48:08.840
while it just burned all of the enemies to bits.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.360
It was it was great.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.680
And then, of course, there was the the piss man.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.560
Who had a fire hydrant for.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.600
Yes, yes, yes.

48:17.600 --> 48:18.920
We saw him already.

48:18.920 --> 48:23.400
People, people were making like like at at type thing,

48:23.720 --> 48:27.360
you know, like walking platforms with the

48:27.600 --> 48:32.440
with the wheels as the mechanisms for the legs.

48:32.440 --> 48:35.000
It was there's some really creative people out there,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.720
and it just requires a simple understanding of basic physics.

48:37.720 --> 48:42.920
Mm hmm. And I I'm I'm looking forward to trying to make a Gundam.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.840
All right. I think I've seen that.

48:47.840 --> 48:50.680
I the more and more I see people make these clever things,

48:50.680 --> 48:52.480
the more I feel like I want to get the game.

48:52.480 --> 48:56.040
But, you know, again, it's going to be a busy summer, so we'll see.

48:56.720 --> 48:59.640
I'll find you one of the collections I saw. It was very impressive. Nice.

49:00.040 --> 49:05.040
All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games

49:05.080 --> 49:08.000
we have been playing this week, Zelda or otherwise.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.360
So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you. How is your gaming week?

49:11.160 --> 49:13.760
Two weeks worth of gaming, Rob.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.600
Yeah, sure. Two weeks if you want.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.520
Yeah. So I went to

49:20.240 --> 49:22.960
Golden State Pinball Festival last weekend.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.960
So they had a lot of really good ones,

49:27.960 --> 49:33.320
including the the 007 anniversary limited edition.

49:33.560 --> 49:34.880
And I'm going to tell you this right now.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.000
It's not worth money.

49:36.000 --> 49:41.040
It was not as fun as the the classic bond tables

49:41.040 --> 49:44.800
that they have out there in the style of the the classic ones.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.120
You kind of like what they did with Beatles.

49:46.120 --> 49:49.800
Mm hmm. They're they're themed after different movies.

49:49.800 --> 49:52.720
There was a Dr.

49:52.720 --> 49:55.800
No was one of them, and that's the one that that I played.

49:56.880 --> 49:57.920
I played the data.

49:57.920 --> 49:59.600
I played every Star Wars that was there.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.800
So I played a Data East one.

50:02.120 --> 50:05.240
I played the stern and I played the Sega one.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.120
They had the Foo Fighters table done by Jack Danger,

50:12.000 --> 50:16.120
and they had the L.E., the limited edition, and they had the the pro.

50:16.440 --> 50:19.520
And honestly, I think I liked the pro better than the limited edition.

50:19.520 --> 50:22.480
I mean, having the multiple layers of it was great.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.520
You couldn't freaking hear the music in there,

50:24.520 --> 50:27.880
but I got to play in the tournament room when they were starting to pack up.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.000
And the music was great.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.040
The music selection is fantastic.

50:32.360 --> 50:35.480
And the art in it is hilarious.

50:35.640 --> 50:39.520
It's kind of got like the sort of semi Scooby Doo vibe of them

50:39.520 --> 50:40.800
and their van and everything.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.920
And then as far as oh, and I ran into Amanda.

50:46.880 --> 50:49.240
I know. Thanks for the pick. Yeah. Yeah.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.000
So they had a pin bot there.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.480
They still put googly eyes on it, and it was hilarious.

50:55.080 --> 50:57.840
I played Shaq Attack.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.600
That is I've never gotten to play one.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.360
It's a weird it's one of the gauntlet games.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.360
So, you know, there's a really hit and miss.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.760
It has this like whole mechanic where you go,

51:06.760 --> 51:10.880
you shoot the pinball up a ramp to land in the net.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.840
It's like this big plastic dome over it to protect the glass.

51:13.840 --> 51:17.200
It's kind of kind of ingenious.

51:17.200 --> 51:20.160
They had Galactic Tank Force, which is.

51:23.120 --> 51:25.400
It's not a Jersey Jack, I think, or it might be.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.120
Um, I'd have to look it up again, but it's it's cheese ball.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.960
It's got full motion video.

51:31.960 --> 51:35.560
It makes me think of like an old Sega CD game

51:36.320 --> 51:38.400
with with the little cinematics on there.

51:38.400 --> 51:42.160
I got way too distracted actually watching the the animated bits.

51:43.480 --> 51:46.560
They someone had reskinned an old,

51:46.800 --> 51:49.320
you know, classic table to The Walking Dead.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.480
And that was pretty fun.

51:51.480 --> 51:52.640
I played Mr.

51:52.640 --> 51:57.560
and Ms. Pac-Man, which is a very, very, very weird table.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.640
There was no baby Pac-Man.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.040
I was quite sad.

52:01.760 --> 52:06.840
I played Ultraman and Ultraman is actually identical table to Halloween.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.760
So I enjoyed them.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.840
There's people who are like, it's kind of boring.

52:11.840 --> 52:13.360
I thought it was just fine.

52:13.360 --> 52:14.960
I thought it was fun.

52:14.960 --> 52:16.720
I played a junkyard.

52:16.720 --> 52:20.280
I played this bell ringer thing.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.720
We set some stuff on fire.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.720
Oh, total nuclear annihilation.

52:25.520 --> 52:26.520
Best soundtrack.

52:26.520 --> 52:29.920
It is on Apple Music, Spotify, all of the things.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.440
Absolutely get it.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.920
It's such good.

52:33.920 --> 52:36.920
Retro new wave if you if you like the style.

52:37.360 --> 52:40.360
And it's it's just such a good table.

52:40.360 --> 52:42.880
I super love it.

52:44.320 --> 52:48.440
There was also they had a joust tabletop.

52:49.440 --> 52:54.920
I play OK, so here was my disappointment of the show, and that was Scooby Doo.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.640
I mean, it was all the new voices, which I mean,

52:59.680 --> 53:04.280
some of them are OK, but it just wasn't very fun.

53:04.320 --> 53:09.240
So, OK, so you know how Black Knight 2000 has the double playfield, right?

53:09.280 --> 53:12.080
Right. And you have to do the loop and then shoot the top.

53:12.600 --> 53:17.000
This is almost built like Black Knight 2000.

53:17.040 --> 53:21.840
But it's so slow and the voices are annoying

53:22.080 --> 53:27.000
and the sound effects are annoying and it just and the flippers,

53:27.000 --> 53:31.040
I don't think are a standard with the part and a little bit off center.

53:31.520 --> 53:35.240
So it just was not fun to me at all at all.

53:36.400 --> 53:40.240
Although I have to say the aesthetics of the table were were spot on.

53:40.440 --> 53:41.440
Absolutely spot on.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.760
And I said I played Halloween, which I took a lot of pictures of it

53:45.760 --> 53:49.400
just because I thought the touches in the Halloween one are so good.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.160
I also

53:54.120 --> 53:56.320
I played a bunch of Foo Fighters, actually.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.560
I just had so much fun with Foo Fighters.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.440
I played yeah, there's there I'm

54:02.440 --> 54:06.640
actually looking at my photo library so I can see I played the Mandalorian again.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.240
I played X-Men.

54:10.240 --> 54:10.880
I played a bunch.

54:10.880 --> 54:14.840
I just I played the Evil Knievel table when we were talking about,

54:14.840 --> 54:16.280
you know, racing and stunts.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.000
And I'm I'm sure the listeners understand

54:18.000 --> 54:20.560
you played a lot of pinball at the expo, for sure.

54:20.840 --> 54:21.760
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.200
But the biggest the biggest ones.

54:24.240 --> 54:26.200
Oh, and there's another game and I have to have this.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.800
It's called Bad Cats.

54:27.800 --> 54:30.920
And it has this little thing in the middle of it

54:30.920 --> 54:34.040
where like this lady is trying to chase a cat out with a broom

54:34.400 --> 54:38.080
and the cats all over the table are just like living their best life.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.440
I love this table. It's so good.

54:40.440 --> 54:43.760
But yeah, I played a lot of pinball, but I absolutely think

54:43.800 --> 54:47.000
that the star of the show was Foo Fighters.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.280
Both versions are tremendously good.

54:49.640 --> 54:54.040
And if there's someone who knows

54:54.640 --> 54:59.360
how to have fun in pinball, it's definitely going to be Jack Danger.

54:59.360 --> 55:02.600
Also, he's given me good advice for buying Dan a birthday present once.

55:03.360 --> 55:06.880
He's just a cool guy, but he's actually retired from streaming now, I think.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.920
Yeah, but at any any rate, of course, Dead by Daylight,

55:12.600 --> 55:13.640
significant amounts.

55:13.640 --> 55:16.720
I played Midnight Sun's Cult of the Land.

55:16.720 --> 55:19.920
The new DLC is absolutely hilarious. I love it.

55:21.240 --> 55:24.360
I've been having a pretty solid good time in that. So, yeah.

55:25.800 --> 55:29.200
All right. Well, if that is it for your gaming week, we'll go to Loki.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.120
How was your gaming week?

55:31.120 --> 55:33.160
My gaming week was just Minecraft.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.720
I'm doing lots of building and getting ready to put out another episode.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.880
So nice. Yep.

55:38.880 --> 55:40.880
It was a lot of a lot of building.

55:40.880 --> 55:44.480
Look forward to see. Is it another like like how many bricks in this build?

55:45.600 --> 55:46.680
I don't know.

55:46.680 --> 55:50.440
I don't know because like the because it involved digging out a big hole.

55:50.440 --> 55:53.480
So it it's hard to say.

55:53.480 --> 55:56.520
There was it was forty six shulker boxes at one point.

55:56.520 --> 56:01.640
But I didn't I think I I tend to like try to get myself extras

56:01.640 --> 56:06.240
in case I miss something in my schematic that I put together like

56:07.240 --> 56:10.920
or I want to blend in some of the terrain a little bit more or something like that.

56:11.240 --> 56:13.960
So I don't know if I used all of them.

56:13.960 --> 56:14.520
I have that.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.160
I was going to calculate it when I'm done with all the build,

56:17.560 --> 56:21.960
but it's pretty much done and just have the redstone left to do inside of it.

56:21.960 --> 56:24.200
But yeah, there's another giant Mega Man thing that's in there.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.000
All right. Nice.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.920
Looking forward to seeing it. Yep.

56:27.920 --> 56:28.200
All right.

56:28.200 --> 56:30.920
My gaming week, because I was on a business trip most of the week,

56:30.920 --> 56:32.560
my gaming week was a little abbreviated.

56:32.560 --> 56:35.840
But Dark Soccer, you made this is going to surprise you.

56:36.160 --> 56:39.960
I also played pinball when I was down there because San Diego has a coin

56:39.960 --> 56:41.240
up like they have here in SAC.

56:41.240 --> 56:43.680
And, you know, the coin up chain, for whatever reason, they really like pinball.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.840
I also played the Foo Fighters table this time.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.120
Isn't it good? It's really good.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.920
I don't know if it was regular or limited edition.

56:50.920 --> 56:53.560
I'm sorry. Actually, did it have a top layer?

56:53.680 --> 56:55.600
I don't think so.

56:55.600 --> 56:58.640
But let me check, because actually what I can do is thanks to that whole,

56:58.640 --> 57:01.480
like stern insider thing, which I love.

57:01.800 --> 57:05.800
You can see I can actually see my history of what I played here.

57:05.800 --> 57:07.480
So I can actually tell you.

57:07.480 --> 57:10.200
But I know I played that Avengers machine for the first time,

57:10.360 --> 57:13.680
and I got two free replays on my first game of that.

57:13.880 --> 57:16.800
So that was like awesome that I was able to do that.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.200
So let's see, I'm going in and looking right now.

57:24.280 --> 57:27.040
OK, Foo Fighters Pro, it says pro.

57:27.560 --> 57:28.680
All right, you play the pro.

57:28.680 --> 57:33.600
OK, and then I played Godzilla Pro Avengers Infinity Quest.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.560
That was a machine I got three replays on.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.000
Was pro. And then I played Mandalorian.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.440
Yeah. Yeah.

57:39.440 --> 57:41.320
The Avengers game is actually pretty good.

57:41.320 --> 57:43.040
I liked it. I liked it.

57:43.040 --> 57:44.440
So that was, yeah,

57:44.440 --> 57:48.520
random pinball adventure of my own that when I was trying to kill time

57:48.520 --> 57:50.440
in San Diego in the evening.

57:50.440 --> 57:51.480
If I can add one more thing.

57:51.480 --> 57:56.400
Yeah, we actually just getting rid of our medieval madness.

57:56.400 --> 57:59.200
And I forgot what else we got rid of.

57:59.440 --> 58:01.720
It might have been Iron Maiden.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.560
And we now have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

58:04.560 --> 58:07.800
The newer one. Oh, we have Black Knight Sword of Rage.

58:08.480 --> 58:11.120
And we have we already had the limited edition topper.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.800
So that's getting added on.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.600
And then, of course, Weird Al's on his way.

58:14.600 --> 58:18.280
I'm I'm sure you've heard of it, but I was listening to Bobby's show last week

58:18.280 --> 58:20.440
since we weren't here to hear it live.

58:20.440 --> 58:21.200
And he was talking about

58:21.200 --> 58:25.360
like a vinyl soundtrack for some pinball games, including medieval madness.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.960
And I was like, total nuclear annihilation is getting one. Interesting.

58:28.960 --> 58:31.600
I just I wasn't sure if you were on this because I knew you were a fan

58:31.600 --> 58:32.400
of medieval madness.

58:32.400 --> 58:35.160
And I this the like when I heard the song that

58:36.880 --> 58:39.560
like that whole thing of like, oh, I've heard this in Darksiders garage.

58:40.360 --> 58:42.560
That was only that was Black Knight 2000.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.600
Oh, no. Yes, it was Black Knight.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.960
Sorry. Medieval something.

58:46.960 --> 58:51.160
Sword of Rage has a Black Knight 2000 mode

58:51.160 --> 58:53.720
that plays some of the the old stuff.

58:53.960 --> 58:54.920
Interesting.

58:54.920 --> 58:57.840
By the way, I sent you the picture of the of the bad cats.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.280
I'll have to check that out.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.680
Sorry, my phone is on monitor right now. But yeah.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.600
Discord.

59:03.600 --> 59:06.080
As far as video games go, I've been playing more Dead by Daylight

59:06.080 --> 59:09.280
than I usually do, just with the double blood points happening this weekend.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.520
I'm like, oh, I guess I should like actually work on the tome.

59:11.760 --> 59:15.360
So I finally got Renaldo to prestige one.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.200
That's cool, I guess.

59:17.200 --> 59:19.400
Renaldo is so loud, though.

59:19.440 --> 59:21.440
Oh, well, I mean, I just wanted his perks.

59:21.440 --> 59:25.120
So yeah. But do you think he's like Leon levels of loud?

59:25.920 --> 59:26.920
He's pretty loud.

59:26.920 --> 59:29.200
I thought they were going to equalize that.

59:29.200 --> 59:31.600
They're supposed to equalize all the volumes at some point. I don't know.

59:31.920 --> 59:33.520
But I've been I've been working on.

59:33.520 --> 59:38.040
So I have like every perk on Cheryl, every perk on Leon, purple perk meeting.

59:38.840 --> 59:40.520
I want to do that for Dwight.

59:40.520 --> 59:42.160
I think I'm going to work on now as well.

59:42.160 --> 59:44.520
So, yeah, so it's been placed in Dead by Daylight.

59:44.720 --> 59:48.360
Final Fantasy 14 got a new patch this week, the Dark Throne.

59:49.080 --> 59:52.280
This is the one where Golbez is a big fight in it.

59:52.280 --> 59:55.400
I mean, spoiler alert, but we know that they've been doing

59:55.400 --> 59:58.480
a lot of Final Fantasy 4 content with these patches.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.720
So it just was natural that you're going to fight Golbez.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.840
I thought they did it really well.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:08.160
Again, Soken kicks butt on the soundtrack and he did a remix of the moon theme

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.480
that plays on the outside of the moon, the really haunting kind of song.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.800
He did that for like the I won't get too much into the details,

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.600
but for the place, you would assume a theme like that would be used

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.680
in Final Fantasy 14 as well is very, very well done.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.400
So I like where the story went there.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.640
I'm very curious to see what the expansion lead up ends up being,

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.800
because I could see it kind of go in a couple of different directions right now.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.480
So it'd be very interesting.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.440
Yeah, so that was pretty much my gaming week, honestly,

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.720
not a lot of new stuff.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.880
But this week, I know there's some big stuff coming.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.400
So I'm very, very excited about it, that's for sure.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.280
All right, we're going to get into some news here at the top of the show,

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.040
even though we're like an hour in because the PlayStation Showcase.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.840
But I thought we could start tonight with some headlines that actually focus

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.280
on last week because we we missed some big announcements

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.880
by not being here last week.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.320
So, Loki, what was one of the big things we heard about last week?

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.040
Last week, we got the reveal of the new game from NetherRealm Studios.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.880
It is another reboot of Mortal Kombat.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.360
So now Mortal Kombat one is going to be coming out September 19th.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.720
Let's do the time warp again.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.880
It would technically just reset the timeline in Mortal Kombat 11.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.240
Yeah, that's but now but now it's like, oh, but in this timeline now,

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.680
Sub-Zero and Scorpion can be friends, as can maybe Katana and Mileena.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:38.920
So now and now Liu Kang is a god and Raiden's just a normal farmer.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.440
So that was from the end of Mortal Kombat 11.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.560
No, I know. So yeah, they are they are continuing the story,

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.400
but I can't help but feel like, OK, they just did this in Mortal Kombat 9.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.400
But OK, I mean, do we really care? Nah.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.200
Like, as long as the game's good, who gives a shit?

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.960
Let him reboot it every game. Who cares?

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.320
Just just have some good characters, some good moves, fluid gameplay,

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.240
and people are going to eat it up. It's fine.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.440
I think the like alternate take could be interesting.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.080
But the only thing that's going to be weird about it, sorry.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.600
The only thing that's going to be weird about it is that meanwhile,

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.240
we have these updates on the Mortal Kombat 2 movie.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.200
So they've cast the actresses that are going to play like Jade and Katana,

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.160
like some of the news is out there about that.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.040
So they're doing a second Mortal Kombat movie, obviously.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.920
But now it's like, OK, wait a minute.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.400
So now we have the movie timeline, the game timeline

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.280
that it's starting to feel like Marvel over here.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.040
So but it's fine. It's just it's just funny.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.200
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's it's.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.600
I assume the movie is going to be like a different.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.200
I mean, they have like I don't know if that movie really felt like

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.320
it followed one of the official timelines of the game.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.640
They kind of do their own thing, but.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.480
I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.600
Comment in chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Zen Monkey 11 says I was over Mortal Kombat after Mortal Kombat 3,

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.920
as were a lot of people, to be fair.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.000
Not everybody took to the 3D.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.560
I liked Mortal Kombat 4 and I think 4 had some really good characters.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.440
Like I love Tanya.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.000
I love like who is the wind god, Fujin, I think.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.520
Like there were some really good characters in 4 that I liked.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.480
But I understand the shift to 3D.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:35.640
It didn't work completely for Mortal Kombat.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.240
And then I think what made Mortal Kombat hard to follow for me

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.960
for a while was that it left the arcades.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.640
So then they had a string of a bunch of games like Deadly Alliance,

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.400
Armageddon and all these games that were console only releases.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.240
Basically.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.280
So I think a lot of people and they didn't number them anymore.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.440
So I think a lot of people kind of fell out of the series

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.200
while they were releasing these console only things that wasn't having

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.800
parity with arcade releases.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.120
And then finally, Mortal Kombat 9 essentially rebooted Mortal Kombat.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.680
That was the first reboot.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.040
And that was I mean, because that was kind of a neat.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.160
Even though, yes, I play those games, I'm like, God, the violence is

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.720
the violence is starting to be a bit much in these games, especially

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.720
11 and 10.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.240
Like, damn, it's it's hard to watch.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.600
It's hard to watch, quite frankly.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.880
But at least I know when to look away, you know, the game.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.320
But the game itself is really fluid.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.000
So it's it's it's it is a good fighter.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.520
Like it's you can't deny that.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.200
So there's that.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.600
Anyway, so I'm excited for Mortal Kombat 1, just from a story perspective,

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.800
as much as I tease it for doing the time warp again,

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.400
I think it will be kind of interesting.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.200
And I'm curious what direction they go with it.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.160
But of course, it is about the gameplay.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.840
So. All right.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.560
Well, moving on to another story here.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:02.600
Unfortunately, last week, we had a legend in the industry pass away.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.400
So I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of Bob

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.080
Smith to video game culture.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.160
Bob Smith was from Atari and iMagic back in the day.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.280
He was a programmer at Atari in the early 80s.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.320
His first big game was video pinball, which was a pretty, pretty epic.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.920
I mean, obviously you play it now and you go, this is kind of compared to like

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.720
but for its time, right?

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.200
It was like, oh, it's like pinball on my TV.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.960
It was pretty cool for the time.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.880
So he brought that.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.920
But I mean, if you think about it, that would be like the first pinball video game.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.840
I think there may be a computer game that predates it.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.400
But the first major, I guess we'll say that

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.600
he was then a supervisor.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.080
He actually was Howard Scott Warshaw's boss.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.160
So, you know, you could maybe blame ET a little bit on him.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.160
No, I don't know. Anyway, he also programmed games to the Atari 2600,

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.280
including one of my very favorites from iMagic.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.160
I did a YouTube on this that's still on my channel like seven years ago.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.560
Dragon Fire, one of my absolute favorite 2600 games.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.480
You are correct.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.840
What?

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.600
About video pinball.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.040
It was the first? OK, cool.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.600
1977. Wow.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.000
Golly, golly. OK, so.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.200
But yeah, he did Dragon Fire, which is a really underrated classic.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.640
Riddle of the Sphinx.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.400
That's a really good game, too.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.360
Holy shit. That's a trip down memory lane.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.880
I haven't thought of that game a long time.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.080
Moonsweeper.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.560
And he did the port of the Star Wars arcade game that was on Atari,

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.600
which for what it was, was the best they could do on the Atari hardware.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.880
So that's that's awesome.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.600
So kudos and a tip of the hat to Bob Smith on an incredible career

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.840
who went on to work at companies like Accolade, the 3DO company,

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.480
and then a mobile startup called Innovative Leisure that was by some Xbox folks.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.240
He also went to the Portland Retro Game Expo an awful lot.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.960
So but unfortunately, yes, he passed away last week.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.160
So just rest in peace and thank you for the contributions to gaming culture.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.760
Thank you, Tiger Claw, for digging up the YouTube channel

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.040
and the YouTube on Dragonfire, which again, it's a great game.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.960
It's one of those.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.760
It's that formula of the 2600 era that I love.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:23.200
It's an incredibly simple concept with a highly addictive game loop.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.760
And Dragonfire was basically two screens.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.800
It was the bridge screen and the treasure room screen.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.080
And when you're on the bridge,

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.080
you're dodging fire that the dragon's spitting at you, basically.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.760
And then when he gets to the treasure room,

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.080
you try to collect all the treasure again while dodging the dragon's fire.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.320
You escape that.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.240
You're back on the bridge and you're doing this game loop over and over.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.680
And it's very it's very addictive.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.400
And I know that sounds very simple,

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.320
but a lot of the 2600 games were and that's what made them great.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.520
Think about a game like Kaboom,

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.880
which is like one of the all time greatest Atari 2600 games.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.160
What a simple fucking game.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.280
And that's the one with the water buckets where you catch the bombs.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.960
That's all. It was a paddle game.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.240
That's all you've you've played this at some point in your life.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.680
You all have. Yeah.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.880
It's an incredibly simple game,

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.040
but without it, there's so much other that followed it.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.160
Anyway, I'm digressing a little bit.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.920
Old man yells at Cloud.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.280
Let's move on.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.880
Dark Soccer, now I know you want to talk to us about some Dead

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.760
by Daylight news that came out last week,

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.920
but I think a little more important,

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.640
possibly some community updates from this week.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.640
I want to give you some space

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.160
to talk about what's going on in the DVD community, actually.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.200
So for anyone,

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.680
I don't think that hardly anyone has ever gone

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.800
to a Dead by Daylight stream and not heard of PUPPERS.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.280
Well, I mean, especially, you know,

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.480
behavior issued like a a charm.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.320
But but PUPPERS has been dealing with ALS,

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.000
which was formerly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.440
It's a neuromotor function disorder that causes

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.000
in the spine to start stiffening up and it affects,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.080
of course, respiration, everything else.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.440
It's terrible. It's terrible.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.400
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.640
And well, PUPPERS has it.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.200
And on the 25th, you went into respiratory distress

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.040
and went into the hospital

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.800
and needed a bunch of oxygen, but just decided to to come home.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.240
You know, there there wouldn't have been.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.120
According to what what Sunshine Post did,

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.080
there isn't going to be like much use in it.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.280
It would just be a few days of prolonging as opposed to,

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.640
you know, anything significant.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:45.440
But then as of the 27th, so yesterday for us,

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.680
he went back into the hospital because of aspiration pneumonia.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.520
And so right now he's in the hospital.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.080
But there's a kudos board up.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.040
I'll find the link.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.120
And apparently all of these messages

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.720
of affection and support have just meant a whole lot.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.320
So I'm going to find the kudos board and link it to everybody.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.760
So if you want to, you know, leave a a good word,

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.400
then I'm sure that it would be very appreciated.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.240
Well, well, there's still time to do so.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.160
I will point out as well, you know, for those that play the game,

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.680
maybe a little bit lightly or what have you.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.520
I will point out that there is a charm you can actually get in the game

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.760
and you can still get it.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.600
And the code is warrior puppers, all one word there.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.840
And you can actually get a charm.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.040
And there's a lot of people in game.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.760
You might actually saw this charm on a hook this weekend while I was playing.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.240
And it actually took me a minute to have it click.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.720
And then when I was on Twitter later, I was like, oh, right.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.800
And so that's actually so there's a lot of people that are rocking this charm,

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.360
just kind of like in support right now of everything.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.600
So, again, that's warrior puppers.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.800
I haven't I haven't played since all that went down

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.760
except to log in for my my daily bonuses.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.800
But yeah, when I sign on tonight,

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.680
I'm going to be going in and the Vic Viper will be retired in favor of puppers.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.000
So, yeah, so obviously, you know, and I will admit

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.120
I was not super familiar with puppers until.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.120
But I have a lot of friends that are.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.920
So it's it's getting in the algorithm in my social media person.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.120
Yeah. And I actually went back and watched some clips

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.440
and he seemed like a lot of fun.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.600
And boy, does the man resemble bald Dwight.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.360
That was right.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.440
That was like, dang,

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:47.000
there's really resembles him saying that Dwight should be renamed Max.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.920
Mm hmm. I honestly think that the bald Dwight

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.640
skin just needs to be made the like the Max cosmetic, kind of like how

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.080
there's other character cosmetics for like there's the Chris and Carlos

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.520
for Leon and whatnot.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.360
I've seen some discourse trademark patent pending on Twitter about

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.360
would it be appropriate to have him as a survivor in the game that gets killed?

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.960
It might be a little in poor taste for some.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.880
My perspective is do whatever the family and him wants in this case.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.520
I think it would be very nice.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.480
I think a nice, you know, this this particular charm

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.640
we just talked about, they gave away for free.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.080
What if they did a shirt where the funds raised from the shirt for

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.480
for a survivor, Dwight or whoever, although how would it not be Dwight?

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.800
But like the survivor shirt, maybe for the core four or something

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.880
that maybe can raise money for ALS research and support.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.720
I thought I'd buy that in a heartbeat.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.920
I think that would be a great thing to do.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.360
Behavior actually put out a really sweet letter

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.480
and even harkened back to that Dwight resemblance. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. So.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.120
I don't know, I think that we'll we'll see something, you know, when when people

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:07.240
you know, when people like that have touched so many others, you know.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.440
They they just become

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.120
something a little bit more than just the person, you know what I mean?

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.280
And I would have to agree that everyone's been calling them

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.960
a light in the fog, and I agree. Yeah.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.240
So well, our thoughts go out to the family and the loved ones, for sure.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.760
And of course, puppers in this case.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.320
I my my my comment on the Kudo board was that

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.160
I hope that these next days are full of peace. Mm hmm.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.720
Um, anyway, I know it's a difficult pivot, but let's talk about some of the other

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.200
Dead by Daylight news that came out officially from Behavior

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.760
this this two weeks ago, I guess this one because of leaks.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.800
Behavior did their anniversary live stream early.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.040
And and I'll I'll be honest, I I had already watched the trailers

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.720
and everything myself, but they had done that teaser at first

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.800
saying that Nicolas Cage was going to be in the game as a survivor.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.400
And while we're not seeing much of anything official, Eurogamer.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.520
Said that that according from to the official blurb,

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.040
I'll just read this after countless awards and over 100 movies

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.600
shot across the globe, Nicolas Cage has seen it all and done it all.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.680
Or so he thought.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.360
While on set filming the role of a lifetime, his performance

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.080
summoned the entity, a malevolent being of incomprehensible power,

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.320
a.k.a. Mia.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.160
The actor soon found himself cast in otherworldly, worldly fog,

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.040
forced to survive against a host of terrifying killers

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.480
deadlier than even the most scathing film critic.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.040
That means they have to have Roger Ebert as a killer.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.480
Just saying, I, I really don't know what to think about this.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.520
This is just really like, do you do you remember the meme

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.520
from like 10 years ago of the old lady going, what?

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.520
Like that, that was my reaction to this trailer. What?

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.560
But it's okay.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.480
Honestly though, the outfit that he was wearing in the trailer,

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.400
someone pointed out that it's very much like in another movie coming out.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.680
So I'm not sure, but there were quite a few things that were brought up

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.000
in the seventh anniversary live stream.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.560
Oh, just real quick before you get into that, I'm sorry.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.600
I just want to say, I don't hate this for the record.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.720
I think it's it's a very Nic Cage thing to do.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.720
So why not?

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.680
Loki, let me ask you for a minute.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:37.040
Does Nic Cage in Dead by Daylight make you more interested in Dead by Daylight?

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.960
It does increase my interest in Dead by Daylight.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.160
See, there you go.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.800
And that's that's the why I would be so that I would be interested

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.800
to see like what like they pair them up with.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.680
Because I'm going to become a Nic Main.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.600
Well, they don't.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.280
To be fair, there are characters that come out with no killer.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.880
Like, for example, Ash from Evil Dead does not have a counterpart killer.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.920
And there are just as.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.240
And there's killers that came out without survivors like Leatherface and Ghostface.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.200
As long as he gets a perk called One True God, then we're good, I think.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.720
I think it goes back to the red.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.480
So those that have a raising Arizona skin.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.960
But it's actually it's funny because it was

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.400
Tiara was the one who told me

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.640
and they were like, are they trying to get me to play this game?

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.960
I'm like, if anyone I know loves Nic Cage, it's them for sure.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.640
So, yeah, anyway, there there is so much more awesome, though,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.160
because they're going to be a lot of quality of life improvements,

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.120
including an anti camping technique,

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.320
which isn't too far off from the one I suggested.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.280
Remember, I said that the the countdown timer should stop

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.800
depending on the distance of the killer to the hook.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.640
Well, now what's going to happen is that there's a timer. Yes.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.600
But it's the closer they are to the hook.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.320
The the killer, the killer, the survivor on the hook

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.840
will be able to unhook themselves a lot deliverance or slippery meat.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.240
But it also works on second hook.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.200
OLR stays winning on the predictions in 2023, that's for sure.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.360
But I do kind of see abuse for the second hook one for people who bring Moris.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.960
Mm hmm. Now they would do something about tumbling, then we'd be perfect.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.360
But we know we're waiting on it.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.800
And then, of course, there was the new trailer for in transmission,

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.120
which is therefore aid the sci fi horror, which I think is cool.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.560
They have the killer is called the Singularity, which is this.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.800
I guess it's a cybernetic creature that started absorbing human parts

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.600
so that it could function more effectively and killed everybody.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.880
You know, very aliens, alien like.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.760
And Gabriel Soma is the survivor and he's very pretty.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.480
The Mori is disgusting, by the way.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.320
Have you seen have you seen the Mori? It's disgusting.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.040
I saw Nick play some of it on because, you know, I still can't get PTB

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.200
to work on the thing. Right.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.520
Not like the Borg. Think of the Borg in reverse.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.680
OK, wait, I'm going to I'm going to play this on stream,

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.200
but I'm going to put a content warning out.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.720
But I am I am just playing a video game here.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.280
So and you won't be able to see us on the podcast feed anyway.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.080
But let me let me play this Mori for you on stream here.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.520
Sorry, I'm getting it set up here because you'll see that this

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.320
it really goes next level with some of the light gore

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.160
that they're doing in the game, basically.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.360
So and that's the new survivor.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.840
And so it's it's pretty gross. But

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.800
that's what some people want out of Dead by Daylight

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.240
is melted faces.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.600
So there you go.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.600
OK, the shot is done for those that looked away.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.800
All right. At any at any rate, the well, you know,

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.160
people are just going to walk around taking pictures of the corpses.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.040
I'm sorry, I do that.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.000
But but anyway, the thing's power is really neat, though,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.680
because you put these globs up that act as cameras.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.920
And so you can pretty much watch like whole areas of the map

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.320
and then shoot the glob onto somebody.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.040
And you have to do shit to get it off.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.200
And yeah, I'm not going to go in.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:29.720
I love S.H.A. 100 Matt's comment in chat saying like any horror franchise,

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.760
it eventually ends up in space. Yes.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.800
And Fixation Gaze, big fan of the Mori saying DBD needs more of this.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.440
There are a lot of people

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.400
who does not like getting Moried at all.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.480
Like, I will die on that second hook to avoid a Mori.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.680
That's just how I am.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680
I don't know what it is.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.680
It's just like some thing in my brain.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.280
But at any rate,

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.640
they're also going to be doing partnerships for cosmetics

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.080
for with Slipknot and Iron Maiden.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.040
And the one that makes me really happy is with Nakamura Ikumi,

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.640
who is just a wonderful, wonderful concept artist.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.240
But my the best cosmetic in the universe is coming out.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.080
We are finally getting Sukeban Julie.

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:19.760
I've told we know what a Sukeban is, right?

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.120
Well, for the listeners that don't.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:29.360
OK, so it was very much a big trope in like 80s manga anime TV.

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.080
It's the the schoolgirl that wears the extra long like Zaki in Project Justice.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.520
Mm hmm. Or Sukeban Deco, which was another anime, The Girl with the Yo-Yo.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.360
But like wear the mask, although hers is the full legion mask,

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.360
the hair pulled back and the extra long pleated skirt and the kind of oversized,

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.600
you know, sailor top and, you know, kind of a bad ass girl.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:56.640
It kind of like go go you body. But.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.640
This is. Yeah, and she did.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.480
She had just a regular schoolgirl outfit and not a not the Sukeban look

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.320
is very specific, but I'll find I'll find a picture.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:11.640
But for anyone who played Project Justice, it's Zaki kind of same

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.960
same relative look.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:18.400
Yeah. And not like the sweater outfit, but the full on sailor top.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.040
But anyway, I'm very happy about that because Julie needs

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.800
all the love because Susie gets all the cosmetics. Just saying.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.760
All right. To our relative.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.160
There's one more thing. One more.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.480
Yeah, I was to say, there's one more thing I'm waiting for you to get to,

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.440
because I think it's really exciting.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.040
Yeah, but supermassive games, as in the group

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:47.440
that did the quarry is going to be working on a game

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:50.080
with their subsidiary, Midwinter Entertainment,

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.640
doing a new game in the Dead by Daylight universe.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:02.160
It's a single player interactive story that will sit

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.080
sit very well with the lore of Dead by Daylight,

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.480
even though half the lore contradicts itself, but whatever.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.920
So you will have a team of up to four players

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:17.120
going into a different area in the in the entities realm.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.960
And, you know, I'm guessing sort of like

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.600
maybe like left for dead ish is kind of my thought. Yeah.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:32.040
But I, I, I really like it, although I think that having something

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.440
kind of like the quarry in Dead by Daylight universe would be also cool as well.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.920
As to be awesome. I as soon as that was announced,

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.880
I got a text from our pal Shane, who, you know, he's usually pretty.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.160
Yeah. Oh, is he? He was usually pretty whatever about Dead by Daylight.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.840
But yeah, when the supermassive thing was announced, he's like, all right,

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.880
I guess I have to be interested in Dead by Daylight now,

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.760
because supermassive is making a game about it.

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.600
And I'm like, honestly, there's a ton of original characters.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.040
It makes that's actually how I heard about it,

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.640
because I wasn't able to watch the thing live.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.920
Oh, yeah, Shane is in chat.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.680
Supermassive game is what will get me interested in DVD,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.160
which is crazy, since DVD has a good amount of characters I love already.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.640
I wouldn't expect the licensed characters get over into the supermassive game,

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.280
but like it's got a lot of interesting characters in it,

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.200
especially in the survivor side of things.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:22.480
I mean, some of the killers are very like, like to me, like Billy is like,

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.120
because they didn't have Leatherface license yet. So they made.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.520
So some of it's very derivative, but some of some of the killers are really cool.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.040
Well, and of course, that also leads

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.880
to the mini game in Dead by Daylight when you hear a chainsaw.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.080
Which one is it? Yeah, right.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.800
But but yeah, I kind of have have a feeling that it would be like

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.080
the first for, you know, Dwight, Meg,

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:51.000
Jake and Claudette. Yeah.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.360
As as the four and, you know, being,

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.920
quote, the first, I'd say, group together in the fog. Yep.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.800
You know, and there's a fanfic I actually super like,

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.520
I'll just touch on it for a second and someone fixie, it's that fanfic

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.240
where they talk in this fix, like little headcanon thing.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.280
They had that when you meet somebody in a match

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.440
and bring them out with you, that they can join your campfire.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.640
And that that's how, you know, even people who had been there for a while,

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.120
how they eventually came to meet each other.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.360
And so I kind of like that idea and adapting that into this game,

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.760
that they were like the first people to meet up and actually be a team.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.760
I guess it wasn't the supermassive game,

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.760
but the other game you were talking about, like the the more sci fi.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.560
No, no, no. The other DBD spinoff game that they're making

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.000
that sounded like it was about the survivors or excuse me,

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.000
like not the folks in the entity,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.280
but the families and friends of people that have been abducted

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.160
by the entity looking for them, that that's like the plot of that game.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.000
That sounds like a neat concept for a game, too.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.960
So where was this from?

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.840
I don't know. No, no, no.

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.280
It's it's a legit thing that they announced. I don't remember.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.720
I haven't seen that. Dang it.

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.320
Let me see.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.360
Sorry, if you can hear my typing coming through.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.960
I have a life left because I'll just be doing nothing but playing all of this.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.080
OK, OK. Supermassive is making the quarry

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.040
is making the single player adventure game like,

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.360
but you mentioned midwinter entertainment.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.120
They are making the other game, the PVE co-op game that is its own thing.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.080
So these are two separate games.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.840
By the way, I put the picture of Julie as the skib on.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.800
And of course, her knife is like a tanto. I love it.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.000
The other, by the way, the other characters getting the treatment

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.720
from Nakamura-san is the oni.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.880
He's getting sort of like the classic ghost where

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.760
he's got the candles attached to his head.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.000
For anyone who ever watch Ranma and Nibu no Ichi, it's like Ghost and Coogie.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.920
And then Yui is getting sort of like a semi posh exercisey look.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.480
It's like Yui's day off, I guess.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.320
But anyway, yeah, I thought Yui's getting new cosmetics, too.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.000
So, yeah, there's a lot of exciting stuff going on in Dead by Daylight.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.800
I know we talk about this game a lot because we play it a lot,

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.160
but I'll say one other quick thing about it and then we'll move on to other games

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.040
because there was a comment that came up in chat and hooked on you on consoles.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:44.200
Fixie brought up that, you know, Nick Cage, it's not uncommon

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.960
for them to release killer or survivors by themselves.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:52.280
And actually, if you look at the roadmap,

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.520
which I think Fixie had pointed out,

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.840
the roadmap actually shows that there's going to be either it is it seems

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.320
in this new roadmap, there is some new stuff coming out

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.640
where killers or survivors are being released on their own.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.400
It actually looks like for this year,

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.760
a lot of these upcoming releases are going to be solo killers or survivors,

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.680
which indicates they're probably killers

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.200
that don't necessarily have a memorable survivor, I hate to say it,

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.840
or my hope is the survivor that's coming out on their own.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:26.080
My hope, my prayer, my demonic worshiping circle, Sidney Prescott,

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.520
please let that be the survivor that's coming out on their own

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.160
to finally couple with Ghostface. I hope, I hope.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.840
But it's not the same Ghostface unless they do like

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.120
like another skin that would be...

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.680
They could, yeah, do another skin or I don't think anybody's going to care.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.040
I mean, maybe the Laura Piris will, fine.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.840
But like put Nev and Sidney, they could...

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.280
I don't think that Nev has signed off on that, on her likeness.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.160
They could, I could also honestly, and this would be a little bit cheaper,

01:27:59.160 --> 01:27:59.840
but they could do it.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.640
But I could see them doing the sisters from five and six,

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.120
Jenny Ortega, and I can't remember the other gal's name,

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.240
but I could see them doing them as survivors as kind of a

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.680
the Freddy character we got was Quentin.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.880
Oh, that would be my other pick.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.680
Heather Logenkamp from Freddy would be a great solo survivor.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.880
Yeah. Although, although if they bring out Nancy,

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.440
I want a freaking Alice skin, OK?

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.280
Alice was the best. She kicked way more ass.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.960
I'm talking about original Nancy.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.320
Yeah. And Shane points out the franchise is moving on from Nev's character.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.600
So it'd also be weird at this point,

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.600
not necessarily because we get classic character releases sometimes,

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.800
but I could absolutely see them doing the sisters from the newer movies.

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.960
As far as solo killers,

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.920
it's funny that somebody brought up the Babadook because actually I,

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.400
I think the community would go fucking wild if for Pride Month,

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.280
they announced the Babadook as a new killer. I'm sorry.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.960
Like people would go crazy. I think that would be incredible.

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.960
I have no idea what the powers would be or anything, but they'll make,

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.760
they'll figure out a way. They will. I also, I'm still hoping someday Penny,

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.920
I know we have a clown already, but we don't have Pennywise from it.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.440
And that's, that's the killer I most want to see. License.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:21.360
Fixie brought up Candyman and that's actually been a rumor for like the last

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:27.360
three years because the original actor posted that he was working with behavior

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:28.200
on something.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:31.960
Oh, that's, of course. And that would make a lot of sense for,

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.480
honestly probably doesn't have a survivor with it.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.880
And then B. Morrie.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.560
Oh man. That'd be great.

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:44.680
People have been begging or, or pumpkin head maybe.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.120
But I don't know. You know who I think actually should be the killer?

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.760
Kathleen Turner, a serial mom.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.840
Hell yes to that. Hell yes to that. Beverly Sutphin.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:04.160
But it needs, it needs Mink Stole as the cousin or whoever is,

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:08.800
or the neighbor that's on the phone. You know, did you just say pussy willows?

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:15.360
Anyway. All right. Moving on, moving on. Uh, Loki,

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.000
you get to take us away from Dead by Daylight. Bring up,

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.480
let's get back to news from this week. So Loki,

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.640
what happened in gaming this week?

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.640
So this week, uh, Daedric or yeah, Daedalic, um,

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.520
Entertainment had released the game Lord of the Rings

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:34.280
Gullum and apparently it was garbage.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.000
It's another game and another, another garbage game. Um,

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.840
there's lots of bugs, lots of, uh,

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.560
graphic glitches and whatnot. Um,

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.000
it's got bad UI that looks horrible. Um,

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:53.320
it just plays like garbage and yeah, so apparently,

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:57.480
oh, and it was a $70 game by the way. Um, so they,

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:01.400
of course put out an apology as you do nowadays.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:05.240
As this tradition with the white text on a black background and all the,

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.800
and all the works. Yep. Yep. Yep. Dear players,

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.080
we would like to seriously or sincerely apologize for the underwhelming

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.680
experience many of you had with the Lord of the Rings Gullum upon its release.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.840
We acknowledge and deeply regret that the game did not meet your,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.880
meet the expectations we set for ourselves for dedicated community. Yeah.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.240
But you knew that when you released it. So, uh,

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.040
we please accept our sincere apologies.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.560
Our goal is to, well, let's see, are they going to fix it?

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.920
Our development team has been working diligently to address bugs and technical

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.920
issues. Many of you have experienced,

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.800
we are committed to providing you with patches that will allow you to enjoy the

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.640
game to its fullest potential. You know,

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.040
how about you do that before the game comes out? You know, like how about, um,

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:54.200
we look at say, tears of the kingdom, you know,

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.960
they've delayed that game by a year to do extra polishing and stuff,

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:01.760
and now you guys are just rushing the stuff out and this isn't the first game.

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.120
This is like not even the first game within the last month that has done this.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:05.960
So

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:13.040
I don't know. I don't know. Stop pre-ordering games. There you go.

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.120
You can do that. Yeah. Right. Just stop pre-ordering games. Uh,

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.520
and this is why people do that. So, um, yeah. Um,

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:26.600
especially $70 games, like it's like, it runs awful.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.800
But like the fact that you're saying, well, we need $70 for this game, $70.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.160
Once again, when I hear a $70 price tag for a game,

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:37.760
I have a $70 level of expectation for that. And I'm,

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.120
I'm tired of people saying, well,

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.920
games were more expensive when I was younger and stuff like that,

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.560
like on the super Nintendo and stuff like that. Yeah. But the, you,

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.200
you forget that that's just the sticker out the door sticker.

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:54.320
You also forget that there's all the game passes. There's the season passes.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.440
There's different battle passes, different DLC.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:03.440
That was not something that was in available when you had $89

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:06.840
games at, you know, you retailers there for like Street

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.120
Fire 2 or something like that.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.480
So you have to remember, even though it's just it,

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.640
it's just not, um,

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.240
it's just not comfortable.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.680
You can't really draw a comparison from that.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:28.680
Actually, when I bought Killer Instinct in 1995 for 60 bucks,

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:31.240
that's like 120 bucks today. Yeah.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:36.920
So 70 now is actually

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.240
less than what I would have spent for that then.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:42.600
And even with DLC and everything,

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.040
how many games are you going to pay double the money of the original game?

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.600
Well, OK, never mind. I played Dead by Daylight. Never mind.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:54.840
I'm I'm also like, I'm just sick of studios putting out these types of

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:59.320
notices that we see here on stream and that Loki just read for us when, like,

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.800
they knew the game was of a certain quality when it releases.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:07.440
It was it was these boardroom decisions and investor decisions and,

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.040
you know, executive decisions to release the game,

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.400
despite the fact that they know it's not in a great condition.

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.280
And for once, can I also say this for once?

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.400
I would like to see a company put out one of these notices

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.720
that just get to the fucking point, release this. This is it.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.080
That's the note we need to see.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.240
Sorry, we fucked up that. That's it.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.360
Like spare me all of these other words and say that you're really sorry

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.280
that you fucked up.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.040
Yeah, because half the time when they have these roadmaps

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:44.560
to fix their games and it's it's always a roadmap like you can clearly see

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.560
that they needed at least six months to a year's worth of more

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.840
development time, but they want to recoup some of their money or whatever.

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.920
But like half the time, they don't even bother with fixing everything

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.120
that's been broken with it.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.640
Or that pushes off like other like DLC plans and stuff that you may have had.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.200
So you buy the game.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.080
Oh, cool. I'll get this extra content in a month.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.800
Oh, well, no, I can't because they screwed up a bunch of stuff

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.200
when they were developing the game.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.520
And now we have to wait another year before we even see any of that.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.280
Shane wants to point out in chat,

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.840
OG Killer Instinct is still worth one hundred and twenty bucks

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.720
for the soundtrack alone.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.760
I mean, I have to have two copies of the soundtrack. Fair.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.640
Killer Cuts.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.080
Killer Cuts. Yeah, it had like some really weird versions

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.640
of some of the stuff, though.

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:36.040
Dejirama says seventy dollars and still no instruction booklet.

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.360
Amen to that.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.240
Bring those back.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.920
All right. Let's see. Let's move on.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.440
Oh, another company had a gaming showcase this week.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.040
It wasn't PlayStation, though, but it was another studio

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.680
that makes some games that,

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.120
you know, I think folks around here probably played a few of these.

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.640
And that is Marvelous.

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.680
Marvelous Entertainment did a showcase this week of some games.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.680
It was about a 30 minute showcase where they talked about games like

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.880
Fashion Dreamer, which is a game of the Nintendo Switch fashion game.

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.680
I believe it's actually been shown in some of the Nintendo directs.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.120
So this isn't totally new news.

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.560
Project Magia, a new frontier is coming out as well.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:20.880
Project Life, which is a brand new IP that is influenced from Japanese RPGs.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:24.040
And then Story of Seasons will continue.

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.920
There is another installment for Story of Seasons.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.000
I know some people were really into that on Switch.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.600
So that is going to get a new game as well.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.320
Rune Factory getting a spin off project called Project Dragon

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.440
is going to be coming out as well.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.520
And then a confirmation that Rune Factory 6 is underway,

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.280
but nothing else to say beyond that right now.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.440
And the last game they showed, or didn't show as the case may be,

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:53.560
was Daemon Demon Cross Machina Titanic Scion.

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:58.240
That is being produced by Marvelous's first studio

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:03.160
and being helmed by producer Kenichiro Tsurakuta.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.200
It is a third person mech shooter series coming out.

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.600
I don't know if this is a mech game on your radar, Loki,

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.200
but that is something that you can check out.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:12.880
It is not.

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:13.440
All right.

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.000
OK, so that was Marvelous.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.400
DJRomaS in chat says, Ah, Marvelous.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.480
They be hitting with some niche anime games at times.

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.480
That is exactly what these folks are known for.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.600
And I know these games are up some of y'all's alley.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:27.920
So that's why I mention it.

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.520
No One Special in chat says,

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.320
Does Marvelous Games have any relation to Marvelous Entertainment,

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.240
who is behind some anime series?

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.360
And DJRomaS, who would know this answer better than I, says,

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.320
Yes, same company.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.440
So that's good to know.

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.320
All right, let's move on.

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.720
Dark Sakura with an interesting update in the preservation realm.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.640
Yes, so there is a well,

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:55.120
there was a rare Castlevania arcade machine,

01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.360
and it has been preserved so that it can be played on a PC.

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:06.680
It is it works with a controller, but you originally,

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.160
I think, had like a whip controller that you would use.

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.960
And it's just it was a neat game.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.960
But of course, it was Akuma Joe Dracula.

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:20.040
The arcade is what the name was.

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.920
So Demon Castle Dracula.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.400
But in progress, there's a

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.360
Discord server that I think that has the information on it.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:36.480
But I mean, this was like you can play it with a mouse.

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.640
You play it with a remote to use the whip mechanic.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.800
But it is considered the rarest in the series

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.560
because of just how few of them that they made for Japan and even less for US.

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.080
So there is a sorry,

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.560
video has a link to download it.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:00.080
And so what I will do is I will get the YouTube video link

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.640
and post it in chat.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.640
And sorry, some of the audio leaked through there.

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:08.240
I try to mute YouTube so that they all stay muted.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.720
But sometimes for whatever reason, it resets.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.600
Yeah, I'm playing the video live on stream here.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.240
So because honestly, I feel like I saw this like one time.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:18.480
Go ahead.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.920
It was automatically playing for me and I was telling it to stop.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.480
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.680
So but yeah, this is this is definitely like

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.240
a piece of Castlevania history that most people probably forgot.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.520
So that's really cool that they got that working, to be honest.

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.960
So good for them.

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.640
All right, let's I'm pretty, pretty happy.

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.800
Yeah, I want to check that out at some point, for sure.

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:42.400
Let's see.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:46.920
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I saw this only once at a convention.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.360
Dr. Tzuyu says the music is cool,

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.040
but from what I understand, sound effects aren't working yet.

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.160
They'll get there.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.080
This reminds me of when they were emulating MAME stuff in the early days,

01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.280
like a lot of stuff took some time to get right and get the

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.560
get all the sound and stuff, but very interesting.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.280
All right.

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.240
This is kind of some surprising news, Loki, in the industry.

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:10.800
This is almost a little weird, I'd say.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.880
I feel like this isn't being talked about enough for the volume of what this is.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.800
So apparently and it's still very vague, too,

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.360
because we don't know why partnership was with.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.040
But apparently the Embracer group said that a two billion dollar

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.760
partnership deal that they had with some other mysterious company

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.240
has fallen apart now as of this week.

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.960
And so apparently the collapse of the mega deal,

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:40.200
the partner, which has not been revealed, was expected.

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.040
Embracer said they had a verbal commitment in October

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.240
and described negotiations as taking far longer than expected.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.520
Their shares were down 40 percent.

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:53.120
And of course, you know, they're they're not happy about that.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.160
They said it's been a rough night.

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:01.600
But hey, this is business.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.000
So cool.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.600
There's I mean, there's I'm curious to see what that was about.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.880
Were they looking for an acquisition or something?

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:12.760
Like, were they expecting, you know, two billion dollar investment?

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:15.680
A two billion dollar investment.

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.880
That's like this was something major.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:26.040
And the fact that it was being taught, they had a verbal agreement

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.760
and this mystery company backed out of a verbal agreement.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.920
Now, granted, you can do that. It's not a legal agreement.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.440
It's not a binding thing.

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.520
But whatever transpired between the verbal agreement

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:40.640
and now whether it was a prototype, I'm assuming there was a prototype

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.440
of some sort that was come together in a couple of months.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.480
And it must have been so bad, at least to the rights holder,

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.480
that they decided to walk away from a two billion dollar deal like this.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:55.440
I mean, the thing is something of that magnitude.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.520
This could have ramifications on Embracer Group that are very bad.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.880
And for a studio that's been really trying to build themselves

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.440
with the portfolio over time and stuff, this this is

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.200
this is just not good.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.600
And the fact that the CEO is being as transparent as this,

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.840
which is in part a relief,

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.400
but also like very rarely a side that you hear about in games.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.960
I mean, things get canceled all the time.

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.200
Agreements get broken all the time.

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.160
I don't know if it's at this stage all the time,

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.000
but there are things that happen a lot.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.040
Something of this magnitude.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.400
This is huge.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.160
And so it's it's going to have ramifications on Embracer Group's future.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:44.200
And I think we're all dying to know who the fuck stood them up majorly here.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:48.040
And but well, it's going to take time.

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.440
It will come out eventually.

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.680
It always does.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.040
Somebody on the inside will leak it eventually.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.520
But it's going to take some time for that to come out.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.560
DJ Rama S says, Wasn't Tomb Raider involved in this deal?

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.960
No, this is a different deal.

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:04.760
But Embracer happens to have Tomb Raider.

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.640
Yeah, they already own Tomb Raider.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.880
So no, it's not involved in that.

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:13.680
Yeah, unless it was something about making the games exclusive.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.520
I don't think that I don't think they said I think they said the deal was a new game.

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:20.800
They were going to be investing in like two billion dollars in a new game,

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:24.360
which makes me think it was definitely something on the scope of like an always

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:27.840
online, always connected type of stuff or franchise or something.

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.120
I don't know. Yeah, we'll never know.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:40.520
All right, let's move on to our next story and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:45.200
But first, I've got this story, which is about, of course, Diablo four is on its way.

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:51.040
And Diablo four is doing a partnership again with Kentucky Fried Chicken.

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.560
And through this promotion, you can get some very special cosmetics.

01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:02.480
So last time it was entry into the closed beta or whatever, you know, the preorder only beta.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:10.320
This time, the promo period from May 29th, apparently, which is tomorrow.

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.480
So I'm not hearing if that's finalized yet through July 2nd.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:20.640
But certainly around the time this game comes out, you'll be able to earn five special in-game rewards.

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.440
They are weapons because there's five classes in the game.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:30.120
So they are five weapons, including things like the Dread Pheasant Slayer for you.

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.120
Get it? Pheasants, chickens.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.080
That's something you can get for your rogue.

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.640
You can also get the Vessel of the Eleven, which is for your druid.

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.240
Get it? Eleven herbs and spices.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:44.000
That's stupid.

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.000
This is colossally stupid, but I kind of love it.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.400
No, the best pun, the best pun of them all.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.040
Hold on. I'm going to bring this up on the other screen because it's one of those things you have to see it to believe it.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.320
All right. You ready? You ready?

01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:01.320
The best pun of them all, the Foul Reaper.

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:04.840
I quit, I'm done by.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.320
Logging off.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:07.800
That's awesome.

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:14.160
I'm so glad I hate the collab, but I like I like how I like that.

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:14.760
They leaned into it.

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.040
I'm glad. Yeah, exactly.

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.920
Exactly. They're leaning into it.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:25.960
Now, that said, while while cringy as it is, it's still not up to the magnum opus.

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:28.160
That was the cup noodle.

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:37.760
It's really, you know, cross Final Fantasy 15 like that was just that's just that's just a level of amazement that we'll never, ever see again in this life.

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.640
Look, you you all wondered what Intern Drew is up to these days.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.040
I'm very glad he got a job.

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:48.400
Very glad that he got a job at KFC's marketing department.

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.320
Side job.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.120
Well, I mean, yeah, because he and I are co-workers.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.600
Don't ruin the fun. Stop ruining the fun.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.480
All right. All right.

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.880
Well, let's let's have some fun with a classic segment.

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:07.960
I don't know what I like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio, but I will let the bump say the rest.

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:25.520
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.680
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:33.520
All right, DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.560
While I get the b-roll queued up here.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.480
I know you're going to laugh because I did it just for you.

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:45.400
I know. Honestly, it was one of those things when you when I saw this, I was like, wait, one of those nights that DarkSakura wasn't here.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.280
I never picked this game.

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:48.760
How is that possible?

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.600
Because you must be psycho and have ESPN.

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.520
I guess. All right.

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.080
So what is the classic game of the week?

01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:00.800
It's Diablo. The Diablo.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.680
The one and only.

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:05.720
Without without a numerical modifier.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:10.880
So Diablo is an action RPG that was developed by

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.600
developed by Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:21.320
It came out in July 1997 and is the very first in the series.

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:26.360
It is set in the kingdom of Konduras in the mortal realm.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.880
And you play a hero who works to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror,

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:37.560
and then you fight through randomly generated dungeon levels

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.200
and then go to hell and then you face Diablo.

01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.040
So there were also expansion packs for this.

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:51.040
And November the same year by synergistic software came Diablo Hellfire.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:55.880
And then EA did release Diablo for PlayStation.

01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:01.520
It was also the version was developed by Climax Studio

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.520
and had direct control of the main character's direction

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.560
using the PlayStation controller instead of the point and click like the original.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:12.960
There's a Sega Saturn version considered, but never released.

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.800
It's been up there as considered one of the greatest games of all time.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.080
And of course, it's had sequels.

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.400
Diablo two, Diablo three, and now Diablo four just about to come out.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:28.120
And in 2022, there was a mobile version called Diablo Immortal.

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:35.640
Anywho, you in the original, of course, you point and click and go different places.

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.520
You have actions like casting a spell with your keyboard.

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:44.880
You get items, you learn spells, defeat enemies and interact with NPCs.

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:50.520
The dungeons, as I said earlier, they are procedurally generated

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.560
with themes for each level, like a catacomb with long corridors

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.160
and rooms and caves are more nonlinear.

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.640
And of course, different items to help you level up.

01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:05.200
So there are three character classes.

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:07.520
You have the warrior, the rogue and the sorcerer,

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.840
and each have different attributes, of course.

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.120
And, you know, of course, like the warrior is low magic, but

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.840
he can't learn the higher spells like the sorcerer can.

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.600
But he's a hardcore melee guy, you know,

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.320
and then the rogue is the mid range weapon type person.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.800
And then in Hellfire, the monk was added,

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.120
who is proficient at melee with staff.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.200
And later on, we got the bard and the barbarian.

01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.920
They were actually unfinished.

01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:45.200
And but they were in.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.560
The game is hidden characters, and you could enable them with a little bit of hack

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.200
and you would basically

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:58.760
give the rogue and the warrior their abilities.

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.240
You could get, you know, all kinds of items, white items

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:07.320
were normal, blue were magic, gold were unique.

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.920
Anything that was not one of those, they had to be identified.

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:16.800
You got bows, you got blades.

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.120
You could pay an NPC to have items restored.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.160
You know, just all kinds of stuff like that was fairly

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:28.000
in depth. And there's multiplayer.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.160
So you get to play up to four players.

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.360
The characters are saved periodically.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:38.320
And you can either be aggressive

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.560
or play co-op with other players.

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:46.480
You would use a modem connection or battle.net back in the day.

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.520
The old battle.net

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.680
or IPX network connection.

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:58.120
It did not have the anti-cheats that the later characters did.

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:01.600
So lots of people altered the characters.

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.320
And there were lots of trainers out there using the cheat engine.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.600
But at any rate, I'm not going to go too much into the story,

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.160
because honestly, if you haven't played it now, then hey.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.720
But it was conceived by David Breivik

01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.920
while they were developing the fighting game Justice League

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:24.600
Task Force in 1995 and developed by Japanese studio Sunsoft

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:28.560
with two American studios, Condor Games, which became Blizzard North

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:34.560
on Sega Genesis and Silicon Snaps for SNES.

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.520
So basically, he wanted to do a roguelike

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:44.320
that had turn-based gameplay, but wanted it to have

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:48.000
a quicker enhancement, quicker leveling through it.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.280
And so, you know, they also had plenty of influences in it,

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:56.720
like Telengard, Legend of Zelda, Doom.

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:04.920
And then Diablo was based on Mount Diablo, where Breivik lived.

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.120
That's pretty cool.

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.920
Just bring in your influences.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.960
The game was conceived originally to be a claymation game,

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:19.760
like Clay Fighter, but they went for 3D isometrics instead.

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:26.680
So Blizzard acquired Condor Games and named them to Blizzard South.

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.760
And then there was Blizzard.

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:32.240
Sorry, their Irvine location was called Blizzard South

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:34.840
and Condor Games was called Blizzard North.

01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:38.840
And then Blizzard South was at the time working on Warcraft 2.

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:46.040
This also, though, led to the development of Battle.net.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:54.160
So to keep going on, the music for Diablo only had six tracks.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:53:00.000
It was composed by Matt Ilman and the soundtrack was released in 2011.

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.280
Diablo would normally require the original CD to play,

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.680
but there are shareware versions out there.

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:14.200
It's called Diablo Spawn, and then you could unlock different things.

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:20.360
And then finally, of course, there's, I believe,

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:26.440
the GOG version that has some enhancements now in 2019.

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.840
They didn't think it was going to sell great.

01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.480
They thought it would be OK.

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:36.920
But because of all the positive press, the estimates actually shut up.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:42.560
Their preorders surpassed 450,000 units.

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:48.920
And so their original shipment of 500,000 units

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:51.440
had to be staggered so that people could get their copy.

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:57.200
It held number one for three months before being displaced

01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:01.560
by X-Wing versus TIE Fighter, which is another game I probably need to cover.

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:07.480
But yeah, I mean, the game was very well received.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:11.800
The 94 out of 100 on Metacritic, which is pretty damn high.

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:15.120
Not everyone liked it.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.000
Like, IGN gave it a 7.5 out of 10 for the PlayStation version.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:27.320
But the PC version was definitely ranked higher than the PlayStation version.

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:30.760
The PlayStation version kind of had its issues, too.

01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:33.960
Like, I understand why people would rank it lower, for sure.

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.360
So, like I said, there were

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:42.640
expansion packs and Blizzard actually sold the world rights

01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:47.320
to develop, publish and distribute the console versions to EA in 1996.

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.600
So that's when, in 1998,

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.520
the PlayStation version came out that had no online play.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:58.360
It had a two-player co-op mode.

01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.200
But there were new lighting effects, auto-aimings for weapons,

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:05.200
an option for increased game speed.

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:09.280
And the weird thing is that it doesn't support the PlayStation mouse.

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:16.360
There was a PAL release that was dubbed into French and German and Swedish.

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.640
And then, of course,

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:24.760
the 1998 Blizzard Game of the Year collection contained

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:27.000
Diablo, StarCraft and Warcraft II.

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.000
And then the anthology that came out in 2000 included

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.480
Diablo, StarCraft, StarCraft Brood War, Warcraft II Battle.net Edition.

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:40.200
And so, yeah, there's just been like a bajillion releases overall.

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.320
And then for the 20th anniversary at BlizzCon,

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.440
this is in 2016,

01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:49.400
Diablo III would receive a patch called The Darkening of Tristam

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:53.600
that recreated the original game with a 16-level dungeon,

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:58.040
four main bosses from the 1997 one and special graphic filters,

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.440
eight directional limited speed like the original.

01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:06.200
They did a test patch and then the public test realm,

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.800
and then they had it in there.

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:12.720
So you can still get the game on GOG.

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:14.240
There's two versions.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:18.120
There's the original 1996 version and a DirectX-based version

01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.480
built in-house by GOG that has extra display and graphical options.

01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:28.400
So that is your game, Diablo.

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.640
Great pick, and I really can't state

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.400
how many hours I lost in college

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.880
on Battle.net playing this game,

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:40.960
because you were talking about some of the multiplayer stuff in there.

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:44.440
And this is this is an epic game to be playing on Battle.net,

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:47.680
because, you know, this is in the era of like Doom and Quake

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:48.760
and those same games are coming out.

01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.400
But I was never good at the first person shooters.

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.440
But this this is definitely more my jam.

01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:56.080
But it's it's weird because it's this is a really hard game

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.440
to go back and play now.

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.600
Like I've picked it up on GOG and the Diablo III integrations cute.

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.160
But, you know, it's still Diablo III basically with Diablo levels.

01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:08.680
But I picked it up on GOG and I tried to go back and play it.

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:10.080
And it's it's it's hard.

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.640
It's even hard to play Diablo II now, honestly.

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:18.840
But obviously without it, you know, I think there's so many ARPGs,

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:22.920
action based RPGs that owe so much to Diablo that we just you know,

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.560
we wouldn't we wouldn't have these games without Diablo.

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:28.360
So. Yeah, great pick.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.160
All right. Of course you do.

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.400
All right. We're going to get to some rapid fire news

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.840
and then some world release dates.

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.520
And then we're going to open it up to you all

01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.400
who might want to participate with the show tonight

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:44.280
over on our Discord over at vog network dot com slash discord.

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.760
Or I'm going to see as well.

01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.320
Maybe we have some tweets tonight.

01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:48.600
I don't know if we had emails.

01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:51.120
I don't think I saw any come in, but we'll see.

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.320
But let's get to the rapid fire news first.

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.880
Loki. Yeah.

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:58.200
So they have a brand new Lego set that's super exciting.

01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:00.120
It is kind of cool.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:02.960
It is a Pac-Man bar top cabinet.

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:04.640
This looks fucking rad.

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:08.240
And it's pretty sweet because they actually have like elements

01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:12.040
on the game of the play field to actually move around

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.920
when you like turn a crank and stuff.

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.240
Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.

01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:20.560
Like this is actually, I think, up to the level of like the Lego

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.720
and Nintendo Entertainment System that they did.

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:26.600
The twenty six hundred one wasn't as great, but this one looks really cool.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:29.520
So that is going to be out.

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.680
I don't know when it's actually out here.

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:36.880
Oh, June 4th.

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:39.240
For two hundred and seventy dollars.

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.640
It looks really cool, I think.

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:46.080
I mean, they started that whole sort of live element with the Nintendo.

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.720
Yeah, so that was pretty cool.

01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:50.560
Yeah, looks cool.

01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:52.520
So I have to check it out.

01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:56.480
And then, of course, so we have Super Mario Advance

01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:01.720
now joining Nintendo Switch online, so they've added that as well as

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:07.680
what was it, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance three and Super Mario World

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:12.680
Mario Advance two, which, you know, those are just ports of the other games.

01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:17.160
So. Cool. All right.

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:20.600
I'm excited about that.

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:24.680
Yeah. Yeah. Well, for another little

01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:28.640
teensy bit of news is that the most evil of all Tetris games,

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:31.440
which is Tetris, the absolute Grandmaster two plus,

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:36.400
it will be showing up on the switch via the Arcade Archives

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.360
collection starting on June 1st.

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:41.040
And yeah, be prepared to cry.

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:45.120
It's painful. It is.

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:48.880
All right. And I've seen people beat like do tournaments on that.

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:51.080
And oh, my God. Well, I mean, just don't blink.

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:53.080
It is summer games done quick season.

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.720
So we have to bring up our old pal Kevin DDR, who,

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.520
you know, was there a few years doing Grandmaster

01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:02.160
and showed us all how it was done, for sure.

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:08.160
All right. Speaking of summer season, it's also time almost for summer game fest.

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.320
Of course, we know that without E3,

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:12.640
this is kind of going to be one of the press events we are getting.

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.440
It is going to be, of course, on June 8th.

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:16.640
We know all this already.

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:18.600
What's the new stuff we're getting this week?

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.760
Word from Jeff Keighley that the live show will feature three or four things

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:27.200
that are, quote, pretty big for this audience.

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.040
I think that's I think that's living in Vagueville.

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:34.600
I think the thought of six.

02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:36.080
Yeah. Yeah, right.

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.200
Pretty big is also a very relative thing, right?

02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:42.760
Like Elden Ring was a huge fucking deal to a lot of people.

02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:47.280
But there's other people that were like, you know, so I think it's it's very.

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:51.200
You know, relative, but I think it's going to

02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:54.200
I'm excited to see what they come up with, for sure.

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.440
So. All right.

02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:01.120
We'll see at the event

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:05.320
on June 8th, which is less than two weeks away at this point.

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:10.560
Yes, it's going to start ramping up these next few weeks, that's for sure.

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:11.600
That's for sure.

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.000
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some games

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.400
that are coming out this week.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:18.800
Here we are. We're getting the big releases, right, Loki?

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:21.360
Only one of them, though, remember, because the other one's

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.720
actually two weeks from now.

02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:26.520
So we have Etrian Odyssey

That's yeah. That reboot. Yeah. Yeah.

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:57.960
We have Gunfire Reborn on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:45.680
I forgot you're right.

02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.920
Diablo four is technically two weeks because the early access is this week.

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.920
So technically, yes, it's two weeks.

02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.520
But, you know, the the crazies like me will be playing it a little early.

02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:00.520
All right. But I'm sure it look either you're playing

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.680
Diablo four or you're playing Street Fighter six this weekend.

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.040
Like it's a big weekend for games or maybe the Katamari rerelease

02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.440
sounds pretty good, too.

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.560
There's a lot of good stuff in the future.

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:13.520
All right. Well, let's travel over to Japan where you have a lot of overlap

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.440
as well. And we have a week where we have big game releases coming out.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
We mentioned Marvelous earlier in the show, and they are releasing in Japan

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.520
this week, Loop eight Summer of Gods on the Switch, which I believe

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:25.920
we heard in the US as well.

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:30.360
We love Katamari Reroll and Royal Reverie is out this week as well.

02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:32.960
Reverie, excuse me, is out as well in Japan this week.

02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:37.800
Eterion Odyssey Origins Collection is also out in Japan this week.

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:42.520
And that is in a regular and a limited edition because of course it is.

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:46.520
And that is it for Japan on the Switch.

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.600
But let me take a look at PS5 real quick.

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:51.040
Company Heroes three is out on May 30th.

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.520
That same collection of We Love Katamari is out as well on the PlayStation five.

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.600
And of course, Street Fighter six also released in Japan

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.640
this week on the second same day as everywhere else.

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:05.800
Speaking of everywhere else, what's going on in Europe? Dark Sakura?

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.880
Oh, only a few things, really.

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.320
We've got a killer frequency on the first,

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:16.480
and that is for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:18.760
And then the others are on the second for Switch.

02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:21.600
We have We Love Katamari Reroll and Royal Reverie.

02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.520
Try saying that really fast.

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:27.520
And then on PlayStation and Xbox, we have Street Fighter six.

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:32.160
Something that I actually already have on Steam

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:35.520
is coming out later in the month, and that's Aka R.

02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:40.480
Oh. Yeah, which was originally

02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:43.840
a failed Atari game like like there was a proto.

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.080
And then it's getting it has its release on Steam.

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.800
So interesting. Very, very trippy game.

02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:56.400
All right. Well, we are about to the close of the show.

02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.040
We'll get some last minute stories here in a little bit.

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.800
But first, we want to open up the roundtable to all of you.

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:06.440
You can call in via our Discord channel in the green room over at vognetwork.com

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.160
slash discord.

02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:10.720
We already have somebody in the green room waiting to be on the air.

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:11.880
So why don't we bring them in?

02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:13.760
It's been a few weeks since we've heard from this individual.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.560
Hello. You are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:20.520
Hi, it's Fixation Gaze.

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.280
Hey, Fixation Gaze.

02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:24.160
May I call you Fixie?

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:27.000
Of course. How are you doing tonight, Fixie?

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:28.880
Great, great.

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:32.560
I just wanted to pop in to talk about something that's kind of important

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:36.320
in the realm of video games, but also in the realm of video game movies.

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.040
Oh, which one?

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:38.480
Let's hear it.

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:42.720
Hadn't heard much chatter in the Discord about the Iron Lung movie

02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:44.280
coming out by Mark Fischbach.

02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:46.240
Well, he's directing and starring in it.

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:49.640
If you haven't talked about it yet, we have not.

02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:51.640
So please enlighten us.

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:54.600
OK, so first I'm going to start off with the preface of Iron Lung,

02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:56.960
which was an indie game done in 2022.

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:02.360
It is about basically being in a tiny submarine in an ocean

02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.440
of blood on a moon in a post-apocalyptic world.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.560
Oh, I remember that.

02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:10.280
It was played by the by Mark Fischbach,

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:13.560
also known as like his better gamer tag, which is Markiplier.

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.560
And he immediately fell in love with the game,

02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:20.840
reached out to the indie developer, which is David.

02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:23.960
I'm going to butcher this last name.

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:25.520
Oh, gosh, where is it?

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:27.080
Now I know where I heard it is.

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:28.000
I heard this.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.520
I heard this is the Markiplier connection.

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:32.680
Yeah, Skamansky, I think.

02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:34.200
Skamansky. Yeah.

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:37.520
And so Markiplier recently

02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:41.280
released a trailer for the movie,

02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:45.160
which he has already finished filming. Wow.

02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:50.960
Yeah. And he I'm expecting a lot out of this,

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:54.040
considering I don't know if you guys have seen his other work,

02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:58.360
such as In Space with Markiplier, which almost won him an Emmy.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.720
He was Emmy nominated for that.

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:03.480
The Death of Markiplier,

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:07.520
which was also like his kind of branch out into making this sort of content.

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.880
But he is now kind of severeing

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:16.280
harder into the movie instead of the action adventure

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:21.360
sort of click story mode he did, where you could pick different options to go on.

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:26.680
But now he is fully immersed into the movie creation,

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.320
which is one of the passions that he has mentioned for his his newer projects,

02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:34.920
which I'm super excited to see him make more movies. Hmm.

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:37.840
And for the record, if you want the game on Steam,

02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:40.160
the deluxe edition is under seven bucks.

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.120
Oh, yeah, it's an incredible game.

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.720
It's very affordable for the absolute terror it brings.

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:51.600
For the fact that Mark played it once and then was like, I need to make a movie.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.080
I think it's yeah, I think it's also fascinating

02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:56.640
how we've gone from like YouTube personality

02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:00.800
to like now taking on Hollywood, like literally YouTube taking on Hollywood.

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.920
And I know we've kind of talked about this for for years now,

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:07.400
about the hours that people spend watching YouTube or say things like Twitch

02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:10.280
or other type of content online versus, you know,

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:14.440
how much people are watching cable and, you know, movies

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:17.600
and streaming services and so forth. This is very interesting to me,

02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.760
this pivot and how he's going to be able to

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:24.880
mobilize his audience to support something like that

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:28.640
and what kind of profit it can ultimately make versus Hollywood.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:33.360
What's really surprising is he actually has mentioned his issues with Hollywood

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.880
and with because he he was I mentioned he's Emmy nominated. Right.

02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:39.280
He went to the red carpet.

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:43.280
He was on the red carpet and he commented like not saying it in a narcissistic way,

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:48.080
but that nobody talked to him because they didn't care nor knew who he was.

02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:51.560
He made something that was far longer

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:54.800
than a movie in space with Markiplier, if you haven't seen it.

02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:59.160
It's, you know, a choice game where you can go on several endings

02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:02.520
through several different like timelines based off of your choices

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.760
in which video you press, which choices you make.

02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:12.400
And it was an incredible feat for for acting, for effects.

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:15.880
It was like watching a movie that was 10 hours long. Huh.

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:18.760
And you could keep it had replayability

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:21.440
because you could find a new ending, you could find a secret.

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.160
It was a whole thing.

02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:24.560
And it got him Emmy nominated.

02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:27.880
And nobody cared about this new evolution in movie making.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:30.640
Nobody thought, huh, what if we took this

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:33.640
and we made it like an in-depth thing for our movies?

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.440
What if choices like we could do voting in movie theaters

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.640
to see how something would end?

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:41.760
But instead, they kind of flatlined

02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:44.880
when it came to actually talking to him or networking with him.

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:49.120
And so now he has a lot more passion towards making a movie

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.040
because he wants that to be recognized.

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:54.200
He doesn't want YouTube or Twitch streamers to be sidelined

02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:57.840
for Hollywood celebrities and directors who are already out there.

02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:01.200
Number one, everything you're saying about this, though,

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:04.680
replaced with Twin Peaks, The Return, and that's how I feel about it.

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:08.280
The 10 hour TV show that was a movie based on one long movie,

02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:11.040
completely snubbed by the Emmys and all that stuff.

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:14.400
It was a disgusting robbery of epic proportions.

02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:18.920
But yeah, but but on a serious note, I admire, you know, I'm going to be honest,

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:21.200
I don't follow a lot of the big YouTubers.

02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:22.560
I'm aware of Markiplier.

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:24.520
Everything I've heard about him is that he's one of the good guys.

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:27.600
You know, a lot of people seem to be really into him and that he's

02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:28.640
essentially a director.

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:30.640
Yeah. And essentially a pretty nice guy.

02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:36.600
I love that he is forcing himself into the room because

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.240
and there's there's a lot of places. I mean,

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:43.200
not to get all grandpa, but I'm going to for a minute, you know,

02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.560
think about when podcasting first came, first,

02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:51.920
think about when podcasting first rolled out and this whole show and how we had

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:56.440
to insert ourselves into the conversation because people weren't

02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:01.120
like willing to take this whole emerging thing seriously, right?

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:04.520
Like people don't want to take podcasts seriously because we weren't an

02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:07.080
established magazine or, you know, things like that. Now,

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:10.440
not that I'm trying to put us on the same scale as Markiplier. However,

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:15.480
what I am saying is that I have a respect for somebody who is forcing their way

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:20.400
into the conversation, whether Hollywood is ready for it or not.

02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:22.920
I think that's great. And I wish him luck. I really do.

02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:28.720
Markiplier is a fascinating case study of somebody who has repeatedly made,

02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:33.000
like, I'm going to say, take for example,

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.200
another thing that he did was technically like directed and, uh,

02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:37.680
that was Unus Annus,

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:42.400
which a lot of people cast by the wayside until it was way too late because the

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.720
entirety of Unus Annus,

02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:47.560
even though he was making one video every single day and he was producing those

02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:52.000
videos and editing those videos, same day, every day for an entire year.

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:56.000
But if you actually read into it, there was a script, there was a story.

02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.040
And sometimes you wouldn't see it cause some videos were like rooted in reality,

02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:01.400
but it went into a very,

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:06.080
very nuanced discussion about death and about leaving your mark and about

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:08.680
lasting longer than your life. Like what your,

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.640
what is your content going to say about you in 40 years when you're gone?

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:16.040
And then it was all gone, deleted because of everything eventually is gone.

02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:17.400
You,

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:21.600
even your legacy will be gone someday and that you need to live in the present

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.440
in the moment and make for yourself.

02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.280
And that was a beautiful thing that people didn't realize until it was way

02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:32.200
gone. And we are left with only memory of what he did.

02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:37.760
And that in of itself is another innovation that people are kind of

02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:40.840
overlooking because they go, Oh, Markiplier, he's one of the big dogs.

02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:42.160
He just isn't for the money.

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:47.320
He is a director and he has been refining his

02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:49.840
talent for years.

02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:54.920
And it's now that people are going to finally like recognize that

02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:59.120
he is, he's a talented director and he is pushing games.

02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.960
He is pushing movies and he's pushing YouTubers. Honestly,

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:07.240
he is creating a platform for YouTubers to rise up from just being YouTubers

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:10.160
and to being creators that the public respects.

02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:12.800
Um, I got our chat rooms lighting up.

02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:16.880
I got to get some of these comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:19.760
Uh, E3VL says Hollywood is part of a cliche.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.120
Prince Peach Fuzz says Hollywood is full of nepotism.

02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:27.480
Um, SSJ100Matt says James Cameron will do the same thing and everyone will think

02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:30.640
it was his idea. Ouch. The truth in that comment. Um,

02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:35.000
DJ Rama S says I've had anime cons reject my press application because they said

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.280
podcasting isn't a news outlet. And this is, and this is the thing,

02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:43.440
but I bet they will give press passes to a small newspaper out of a small town

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.240
in, you know, you name the country or you name the County USA.

02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:52.040
I'm not trying to use corporate sponsored podcasts.

02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:55.640
Yeah, exactly. And I'm not trying to shade the,

02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:59.400
like these newspapers because let's be real, like newspapers and magazines,

02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.920
it's a dying art form. However, my point is,

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:05.080
it's a very old school set of criteria.

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:10.320
How many people actually into anime fandom are going to read that article on the

02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:15.400
back page of a newspaper versus the amount of fans that would care about the

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:19.640
subject matter that your show reaches. And I would bet your show,

02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:20.560
as small as it is,

02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:24.840
reaches more people than some of the newspapers they're giving press passes to.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.480
And again, I'm not trying to be shady towards the newspaper,

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:31.400
but I am trying to be shady towards these old school ways of thinking.

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:34.680
People are scared of podcasts. Honestly,

02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:38.680
like people are scared because podcasts are independent and that means that

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:40.560
they are not, they are not paid for.

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.960
They are just people who are speaking with a microphone and that's what people

02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:47.200
are scared of. They want to be able to pay that press off.

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.080
They don't want to have somebody actually come to their show and be like,

02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:51.400
so this is the stuff I didn't like.

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:54.600
This is the stuff I liked because they want money in the pocket.

02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:58.240
There's another reason why Pump Up the Volume is one of my favorite movies.

02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.280
That's the reason is, you know, what they were doing with their ham radios,

02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:07.320
you know, is what we now do with, with our podcasts and our live radio.

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.400
Oh no, that's, remember Orange Launch Radio is not rooted in podcasting.

02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:14.240
I think that's a, that's a very, you know,

02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.880
because the show is so old it predates podcasting.

02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:19.440
I'm sorry to make this topic about us, but it's going to happen.

02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.480
Is that if you think of this show is inspired by long

02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:29.320
form radio shows, which you rarely hear about anymore. That's why,

02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:31.040
cause everybody always goes, they, you know,

02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:33.160
when I introduced the show and talk about it at conventions,

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:35.600
I can't tell you how often I hear from other podcasters,

02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:40.960
you do a two and a half, three hour podcast and every week people listen to that.

02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:45.640
I'm like, yeah, it might not be 11 D billion people.

02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:49.200
We might not have the reach of a IGN or something like that,

02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.040
but you know what? There are people that are like, Hey,

02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.960
I'm going to put in my earbuds as I'm doing my work on Monday and you get me

02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:00.480
through the entire day on Monday. And I love it. And that's, you know,

02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:02.880
that's why we keep doing what we're doing. You know,

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:05.000
maybe we need to evolve, but I don't think so.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.440
I love what we're doing to be honest. We've evolved.

02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:11.240
I love Orange Launch Radio. Honestly, since Dark Separat showed it off me.

02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.040
And I hope I'm a listener for a very long time.

02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:17.680
Thank you. I hope you are too. Well, and, and, and.

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:20.160
For killing all of us in dead by daylight, right?

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:28.960
Don't apologize. Do it again. I told you how we met, right? We had a bad bill.

02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:33.840
Oh, there was something to be in the bad. And I didn't know.

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:34.920
That's right.

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:38.720
He was going around behind me and Gwen making noises and fast vaulting and shit.

02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:42.240
And so we talked to Fixie about it afterwards.

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.680
And then Fixie watched the stream,

02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:46.800
which I also believe was when we all fell in love with get bonked, bitch.

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:50.560
Yeah, it was hilarious.

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:53.960
I didn't realize because when you're streaming one sided as a killer,

02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:56.560
you're not thinking of what the other person is saying.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000
So I go back and I watch it. I was like, oh God, that bill is actually.

02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:03.560
Oh, wait, they said something as they bonked me. That's hilarious.

02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:09.000
And I absolutely fell in love with Dark Sakura and the group,

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.560
and apparently I've been adopted as their sibling. So that is.

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:15.680
I have adopted Fixie.

02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:17.080
Fixie.

02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:20.440
Although from what I heard about your age earlier in the show,

02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:22.960
you might actually be the niece, nephew.

02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.760
What?

02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:27.600
Rob.

02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.760
What?

02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:30.160
Nope.

02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:34.320
Nope.

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:37.920
I guess you could call me next gen Orange Lounge radio.

02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.280
Oh, love that. Love that.

02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:43.640
It's going to be you and Loki's kids.

02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:44.160
That's it.

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:47.040
Instead of Orange Lounge, we're going to have you be the Tangerine Dream.

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:48.480
Oh, God.

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:52.040
That reminds me too much of

02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:54.680
the Jamba Juice smoothie, the Orange Dream Machine.

02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.640
Orange Lounge Radio 2.0 or not New Coke, but New Orange Lounge.

02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:00.320
There you go.

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:02.760
You have to call in and talk about food one day.

02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:07.560
It has to be the the Star Trek font going next gen.

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:10.480
The next generation. I love that.

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:11.320
I love that.

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:12.920
To make it all edgy.

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.720
Anyway, I won't take any more of your time.

02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:18.560
I just wanted to pop in and talk about a project that's near and dear to me

02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:20.800
and also just needs to be talked about more.

02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:22.320
So I'll hop on out.

02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:23.840
It was wonderful talking with you.

02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.480
It was wonderful to have you here.

02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:27.800
Fixie in a little bit anyway, right?

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:28.560
Hmm.

02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:30.720
We get to hear more from you in a little bit, though, right?

02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:33.720
Yeah, there's definitely going to be a stream.

02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:35.880
All right. Well, thank you so much, Fixie.

02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:37.120
Oh, go ahead.

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.120
I'm rebranding my avatar.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:42.480
So if people pop on over to soccer or my streams,

02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:44.280
they're going to see something new.

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:45.520
All right. Sounds good.

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:46.960
We'll be keeping an eye out after the show here,

02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:48.520
which will wrap up in just a few minutes.

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:50.480
We're going to sneak in one more call here before we do.

02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:51.760
But have a good one, Fixie.

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:53.360
Thanks so much for the call.

02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:56.400
You too, Rob. All right. Bye bye.

02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.400
I always appreciate when they take a moment to call into the show.

02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:00.520
It's always pleasant to hear from them.

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.040
Fixie is a quality person.

02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:05.160
Yeah, let's move to another call because somebody else

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:07.600
just popped in the green room and I want to take this call, too.

02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:10.200
So hi there. You are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:12.720
The one and only D.J.

02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:15.080
Ron Mez, how is everybody doing tonight?

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.360
I'm fabulous now that you're here, Rama.

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.720
It's great to have you here.

02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:21.840
Rob, what?

02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:23.840
My brother in Christ.

02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:27.520
Wow. I haven't been called that ever.

02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:33.320
Jamie, my sister in Christ, Loki, my other brother in Christ.

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:38.040
Let me tell you, I don't know what you know about Jamie's personal life, but

02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:44.200
how about how about we just say mishpocha?

02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:46.600
Fair enough.

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:50.600
Now, there's no secret that

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:56.360
M.A. Jam Session is loosely based off of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:00.080
OK, and I know it's a cool show.

02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:04.040
Imitation is the finest form of flattery.

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:05.560
Thank you so much.

02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:06.880
I like what Fixie said.

02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:08.680
From another console.

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:11.480
Oh, my God.

02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:17.120
So part of the reason why I started podcasting is because I have

02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:21.080
I can't write. I'm terrible with writing.

02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:23.680
Jamie has read my emails.

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:26.280
She has given me grief for it.

02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:28.960
I've had a manager that has given me grief for it.

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:33.680
I feel this one hundred percent.

02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:37.320
In high school, I had to take the regents exams.

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:42.520
I double talked my way through the essays just so I could pass.

02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:48.000
And I would write con reports for other websites, including my own.

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.760
And it got to I just can't do this.

02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:54.760
I just feel like I'm repeating myself over and over.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.800
And I realize if I write notes and I talk about these notes

02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:00.760
and I get feedback.

02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:03.680
This is DJ Rama S taking me to church.

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:08.480
This is DJ Rama S taking me to church because I understand him

02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:11.480
one hundred percent when he says he can't write.

02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:13.920
Neither can I.

02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:15.880
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:20.600
Preach. You you sit in the pew and listen.

02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:24.040
Play my grandma. She was the English major.

02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:31.080
So once I got this going, I'm like, we're going to go to conventions,

02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:32.080
we're going to keep this up.

02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:34.720
I would sit there and I felt these applications.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.880
They wanted to know about the last three or four con reports.

02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:42.440
I'm just like, shit, I put the links in

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:45.920
and I would tell them exactly what I was going to do for some conventions.

02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:49.080
I'm a one man band running around taking pictures, doing interviews,

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:50.400
all this and all that.

02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:53.240
And I would tell them we do this on a weekly podcast.

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.400
And they will come back and say, well,

02:21:56.480 --> 02:22:00.120
we don't know what podcasting is, so it's not a viable news outlet.

02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:02.840
So therefore, your press application has been rejected.

02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:05.200
And I'm just like, are you kidding me right now?

02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:10.480
I would say you provide live entertainment.

02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:14.360
With syndicated publishing.

02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.800
I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to write that down.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.040
I swear to I swear to God.

02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:21.160
Oh, how you praise it.

02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:24.680
I swear to God, we're going to just start a Vogue network newspaper.

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:27.800
And then that way we can all say we work for a newspaper called Vogue Network.

02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:33.600
And that will print one issue every month or one one copy of an issue every month.

02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:37.040
So that way it's done and put it in a in a bin somewhere.

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:40.320
And that's it. And then they'll be like newspapers.

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:41.480
Those are so old.

02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:43.520
Now, you know, it's about Rob.

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:47.440
Honestly, that would be really good for my resume.

02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:49.680
I love Fixies comment.

02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:51.560
We could do a zine. Fuck yes.

02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.400
We're taking it back to 97.

02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:54.960
We're going to do a fucking zine.

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.720
I love it. We're going to staple them and do them on a mimeograph.

02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:04.440
Don't mind me, I am getting my coffee because, you know, I had to talk,

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:06.400
you know, I had to talk.

02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:08.720
Spill that tea, Rama, spill it.

02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:13.120
Well, you say if we do the e-zine, we have to save a PDF

02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:15.640
version on the website so we can have an archive.

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:16.920
Yeah, yeah.

02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:18.440
By the way, Rama, I have to ask.

02:23:18.440 --> 02:23:20.880
I have to have you do something for me, but I'll tell you offline

02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:23.480
because it involves going to a Jewish deli in Crown Heights.

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:25.080
I got you.

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:29.720
I can't help but wonder, is this is this related to why I just got a con report

02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:31.240
for publication at VOG Network?

02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:34.760
Because I feel like it might be along those lines.

02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:36.520
Yes. Yes.

02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:38.720
That's why we built it.

02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:41.480
Great. Can't wait to push the publish button on it.

02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:42.920
Yes, I. Yeah.

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:49.560
You know, it's like there are some conventions they are like,

02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.560
oh, I see what you do.

02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:53.680
We'll give you a press pass and others are like, yeah, no.

02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:57.480
I've had people like I have never heard of you or I've been told, well,

02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:59.200
here's what you got to do.

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:01.600
Your Alexa ranking has to be a certain amount.

02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.760
And I'm just like, are you kidding me?

02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:06.280
I'm going to fucking barf.

02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:09.240
You know what? I want some money right here.

02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:12.240
Does it look like I have Alexa ranking money in my pocket? OK.

02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:16.760
No, like some rankings on my Internet in the year twenty twenty three.

02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:21.480
What the fuck is your Internet still powered by a fourteen four hundred

02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:24.280
baud modem? Like, get the fuck out of here.

02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:27.080
Alexa Ray. Is Alexa even still a thing?

02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:30.720
Listen, listen, me and Alexa are on a first name basis.

02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:32.080
So it's fine. I'm sorry.

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:35.040
Was my GeoCities address not good enough for you?

02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:40.480
Fuck. There is another reason why press outlets like mine

02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:42.160
do not like read pop. OK.

02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.160
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:51.600
There's a reason why I stopped putting in applications.

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:55.400
Oh, OK. I actually want you to say, well, your site's not popular enough,

02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:57.840
so we're going to reject your press pass.

02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:59.200
Well, you couldn't pull off E3.

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:03.440
So there the man said, the man said, that is all.

02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:06.160
The man said it.

02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:10.120
There's no love lost between me and read pop.

02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:14.080
As I've told people who keep asking me every year, are you going to Comic-Con?

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:17.120
Absolutely not. It is too crowded for me.

02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:18.680
Somebody hit my camera.

02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:20.720
These hands are ready to eat for everyone.

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:27.240
I understand they have some anime stuff.

02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:30.760
It was the one year they joined forces with Anime Expo

02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:33.400
and it was a giant cluster.

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:36.680
OK. All right.

02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:40.160
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry to all the smart speakers

02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:45.120
I've been setting off, apparently, by saying the A-L-E-X-A word over and over.

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.800
Sorry, Pod Culture and others.

02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:53.840
I'm going to go down this rabbit hole and and I apologize for nothing.

02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:59.240
Amistad was a cakewalk compared to how and read pop

02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:01.280
and AX pulled off their anime weekend.

02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:02.840
OK, it was like that.

02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:10.480
But now that we're at a point where everybody's doing a podcast

02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:13.760
and people are saying this, it's getting oversaturated.

02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:17.280
I'm like, it's only oversaturated if you listen to too many podcasts.

02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.360
I do mine. I listen to Yo Guy.

02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:20.880
I listen to a lot of people.

02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:22.800
I still have time to listen to music and do what I got to do.

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:24.640
Everybody wants to do something.

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:26.000
So you roll with it.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.440
I tell people, if you want to do a podcast, just do it.

02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:33.480
Don't listen to somebody who says you just do it.

02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:34.560
You never know.

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:40.280
As long as you have the love in your heart for it, just have at it.

02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:41.240
Here's the thing.

02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:44.440
You ready? Get your tea, because I'm going to spill some.

02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:45.080
Get it.

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:47.120
Oh, sucky sucky now.

02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:50.360
This is some spicy hot tea, because you fucking ready for this?

02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:51.560
I'm going to say it like it is.

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:56.600
When people say that the market is saturated by podcasts,

02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.640
what they really mean is that the market is saturated by white men in

02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:02.760
their basement doing a podcast.

02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.280
There is nothing wrong with trying to bring more diverse perspectives

02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:13.800
and opinions to the table and enabling more people to get their words

02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:17.560
out there, because it is through that diversity and through those

02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.640
other lenses that we are going to get the criticism that a lot of

02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:26.160
these old fart ways so desperately need when it comes to these

02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:30.720
conventions and these other things that have been built around a

02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:35.440
culture that only listens to these particular voices.

02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:41.520
Sip on that, because that's what saturation, that's what it is.

02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:45.960
That is some bitter vinegar that they all need to drink.

02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:49.400
Let me just say this, and I'm going to go about my way.

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.400
I'm going to finish my nice, nice roast of coffee here.

02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.800
I find it amusing that there are some conventions that will not accept

02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:06.280
my site or certain others, but yet we're the ones that are doing everything.

02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:09.280
I got one person doing interviews.

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.000
I got one person actually writing the reports.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:16.520
I got one person doing photography and we after the end of the weekend,

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:17.360
what do we do?

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.480
We have something ready for you on Tuesday.

02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:22.600
A week later, we got the com report for you.

02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:25.840
A few weeks, a couple of weeks later, the photos are edited and

02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:27.800
ready to share with the world.

02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:30.680
I don't see anybody else.

02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.440
And as many cons I have gone to and they talk about, oh, we only have

02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:37.880
limited amount of press passes, sometimes I find that I'm the only one

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:40.080
that's actually there doing stuff, OK?

02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.760
But it's OK because I love what I do.

02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:52.640
And that's that and that and that is how OLR has lasted 21 years next month.

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:54.160
And now we know.

02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:57.480
And knowing is half the battle.

02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.240
On that note, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap this shit up for the night.

02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:08.880
Do you have any final thoughts or would you like to plug your, you know, little

02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:11.640
underground show that a few cons have heard of?

02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:16.560
Yes, I would like everybody, if they're free Tuesday nights around nine o'clock,

02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:20.440
to swing through vognetwork.com and animejamsession.com to check out

02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:25.280
anime jam session on Twitch and you'll hear me talk about how I should be, I

02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:30.480
should not be buying any more figurines and stuff like that because I had four of

02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:36.080
them arrive at my porch this week and I've kind of started running out of room.

02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:39.440
I just spent three hours clearing out my closet to make space.

02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:43.640
And I just got a new Nightcrawler figure.

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:50.680
Girl, girl, I'm going to turn all the lights on if you can see it.

02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:54.120
I have, there's a bunch of figurines right there.

02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:57.160
There's a bunch more behind the door over here.

02:29:57.960 --> 02:29:59.680
There's a bunch of pops up there.

02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:04.320
I should swing the camera around so you should see it.

02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:06.120
Do you see this?

02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:07.360
I see it.

02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:08.000
I see it.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.120
Definitely like the board game.

02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:12.720
Mario, Mario Kondo is about to punch you both in the face.

02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:13.520
Just saying.

02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:16.040
Oh, Rob, I'm so proud of you for saying her name, right?

02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:18.320
But I also went out and got this.

02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:23.440
I got an awesome PDR shirt at the collection and I realized I've run out

02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:25.800
of space in the drawer to put it away.

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:29.840
Actually in my defense, it's because I've been cleaning out other rooms

02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:32.520
that a bunch of shit's in here, including like some of my gym equipment.

02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:32.960
So.

02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:37.680
If you all could stop comparing sizes for a minute.

02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:42.120
Excuse me while I whip this joke.

02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:47.360
Rob, I'm sorry.

02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:49.000
I did not know your size, King.

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:49.840
I am so sorry.

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:53.360
Don't, don't you forget it.

02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:54.160
All right.

02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:57.440
Get off my program.

02:30:58.040 --> 02:30:58.720
I'm done.

02:30:58.920 --> 02:30:59.680
I'm done.

02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:01.320
I can't with you.

02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:02.480
I cannot.

02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:03.800
But I love you.

02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:04.720
Love you, Mean It.

02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:05.400
All right.

02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:06.160
Take care of my friend.

02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:06.880
Till next time.

02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:15.120
The one and only DJ Roma S from Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays as a part of the

02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:18.880
Voice of Geeks network, but on their own Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash

02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:20.720
Anime Jam Session.

02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:22.240
Whoo.

02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:22.680
All right.

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:29.640
Uh, oh, I had a quick, quick question from Twitter that came through and here it

02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:33.840
is, uh, from Garth the Wolf over, uh, to our Twitter at OLR.

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:35.760
We love Garth Wolf.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:40.520
For all three hosts, name one Final Fantasy series.

02:31:40.520 --> 02:31:41.800
Oh, your favorite topic, Jamie.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:46.040
Name one Final Fantasy series song that resonates with you.

02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:52.760
Um, um, I really like Kiss Me Goodbye.

02:31:54.280 --> 02:32:00.280
I mean, it's just, I love the Angela Aki, like in a really, really, I just

02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:01.600
love her voice so much.

02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:06.760
Um, and I'm sad that she hasn't put on any new music, but I know that she

02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:14.040
went in, uh, to study music in the U S but her, her voice is amazing.

02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:19.600
If you want to hear a really good song by her, listen to Tagami and, um, which

02:32:19.600 --> 02:32:24.720
means letter, and it's about her talking to her younger self, um, and of

02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:25.920
course you want to find translation.

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:30.600
She has covered so many bands in, um, in Japanese.

02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:35.160
Uh, she did, she did, we are the champions in Japanese.

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:41.840
Um, but her voice is probably one of my favorite singing voices ever.

02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:43.440
And Kiss Me Goodbye is such a good song.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:47.560
It was actually the song that got her charted.

02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:52.400
Uh, I remember, oh, go ahead.

02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:52.640
Sorry.

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:58.640
I just remember, uh, reading an interview with her where she went to go see, um, I

02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:03.600
think it was Anna Tsuchiya at the Budokan and she was like, I want to be up there

02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:04.160
one day.

02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:09.880
And then right after that, she got the thing for, uh, Squenix to, to do the

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:10.200
song.

02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:12.640
And a year later she was playing at the Budokan.

02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:16.440
Um, Loki, do you have an answer for this?

02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:19.120
Otherworld from Final Fantasy X.

02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:21.160
Ah, good pick.

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:23.480
Um, I have two answers for this.

02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:27.840
I would say probably above and beyond Terra's theme from Final Fantasy VI.

02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:33.320
Um, there's just something epic about the way that game opens with the mech in the

02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:33.880
snow.

02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:38.360
And there's just, I, the way they kind of weave that theme throughout the game

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:38.880
itself.

02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:42.560
And, you know, just the iconic, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:46.800
I think it's just, it's, it's just so powerful.

02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:49.040
That's just such a powerful, meaningful song.

02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:53.200
A more contemporary answer I would actually throw out there, I'm going to go

02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:53.880
to 14.

02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:59.000
I have to, but I would say the song To the Edge, which is the fight that you do

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:04.040
against the Warrior of Light, um, uh, that you fight as part of the, um, uh,

02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:05.840
Shadowbringers expansion fights.

02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:12.200
The reason why I say that song, when you find out the story behind it, how, um,

02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:17.920
Soken, the main, main composer you may or may not recall was, was battling

02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:22.320
cancer, uh, and was actually in the hospital when he wrote that song.

02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:30.040
And it gives a whole nother layer and depth to that, that is so powerful, um,

02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:34.680
that I would highly, even if you don't enjoy 14, you don't go watch a video of

02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:38.120
this fight, the Warrior of Light fight, or To the Edge is the name of the song.

02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:42.000
It's just, I mean, it doesn't really relate to any other Final Fantasy game,

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:45.040
besides who you're fighting, obviously, which is a really cool interpretation of

02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:48.880
the original Final Fantasy I Warrior of Light, but just when you hear the full

02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:52.320
backstory behind that, it's powerful.

02:34:52.520 --> 02:35:01.160
Um, and just, just goes to show how Soken, not that, not that, um, Nobuimatsu,

02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:06.840
my God, brain fart, not that Uematsu can ever be replaced, but if there must be a

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:11.920
successor, Soken is a hundred percent worthy of that.

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:13.480
He's so good.

02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:15.200
May I actually make an addition, then?

02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:16.000
Yeah, please.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.400
All, all of the music outside of Uldah.

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:19.600
Mmm.

02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:21.720
Yeah, I just-

02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:24.720
I could sit and listen to that for hours.

02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:25.440
The work-

02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:26.680
Because I haven't listened to it for hours.

02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:35.440
The work that Soken has done on Final Fantasy XIV, history will look back on

02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:42.320
it and realize what an impactful fucking guy he was on, on gaming music.

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:46.480
I mean, just the guy from Mario Tennis went on to did this, do this.

02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.360
It's incredible.

02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:48.200
It's incredible.

02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:49.840
Anyway, those are my answers, Garth.

02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:50.720
All right.

02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:55.040
On that note, um, Dark Soccer, I think you were going to bow out just a little early

02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.320
because I know you wanted to do something before you start your stream, so-

02:35:57.320 --> 02:35:58.480
Yeah, I want to make a sandwich.

02:35:58.520 --> 02:35:59.120
I'm hungry.

02:35:59.160 --> 02:35:59.760
No worries.

02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:03.160
Before I check in with Loki on any final stories, then let me go to you with any

02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.240
final thoughts you might have before I wrap it up tonight.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.400
Are they Final Fantasy thoughts?

02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:08.480
If you want them to be.

02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:10.600
Uh, no, I don't really have any.

02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:11.360
Oh yeah.

02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:17.400
Um, I, uh, I, I really am kind of getting obsessed with ballet.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Like, I feel awesome.

02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:22.960
Good.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:23.840
And insane.

02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:32.240
I found muscles that I didn't know were in my body and all of them are right

02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:35.200
around my hip and my knees and they're like, Hey, guess what?

02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:42.320
You old, but, but I, uh, I, I, I fall in love with it more and more every day.

02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:49.120
And I, I feel like I can call myself a dancer, even if I'm, I never liked dancing

02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:54.920
before, unless it was DDR, you remember me saying that ballet has become my DDR.

02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:56.560
All right.

02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:59.560
Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go have a good stream tonight.

02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:00.800
All right.

02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:02.400
Have fun storming the castle.

02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:03.400
We'll try.

02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:04.000
All right.

02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:05.760
Think it'll work.

02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:07.320
It'll take a miracle.

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:07.800
There you go.

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:08.800
Bye.

02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.920
See, I knew she'd be pissed if I didn't give her the follow-up line.

02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:12.440
All right.

02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:13.320
Uh, low key.

02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:14.120
Let me check in real quick.

02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.400
Any, um, um, last minute stories for us.

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:16.560
Yeah.

02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:17.600
Yes, we do have one.

02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:23.480
Uh, so this is not much of a surprise, but apparently, uh, Nintendo was asked

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:30.320
valve to, uh, remove the dolphin emulator off of their, uh, storefront.

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:33.640
I want to say, I'm sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but there was some very

02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:37.280
interesting discussion on this, on our discord server over at vod network.com

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:37.880
slash discord.

02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.320
And the reason why I say that is that there was chat about that the press may

02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:46.480
not be framing this accurately because it sounds like valve actually contacted

02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:52.160
Nintendo saying, um, thoughts and Nintendo replied saying, and I'm

02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:55.960
paraphrasing, we don't like it, get rid of it type of thing.

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:59.160
So it actually sounds like, even though it sounds like, oh, Nintendo's lawyers

02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:03.080
strike again, it sounds like valve may have actually initiated.

02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:06.720
Like, um, are you, you mad bro?

02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:09.840
Like, it seems like valve may have initiated that conversation, which I

02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:12.760
understand, you know, as much as we want to say, ah, fuck valve for doing that.

02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:17.240
I understand why from a legal perspective, they're probably going, you know what, if

02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:20.680
we don't go to the lawyers, the lawyers are going to come to us.

02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:23.960
So I do understand from that perspective, but anyway, I'm sorry, Loki, go ahead.

02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:26.520
I just wanted to get that because I did see folks talking about that on discord.

02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:30.160
I do want you all to know, even if I don't always respond to every message, I read

02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:31.080
discord all the time.

02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:31.760
So anyway,

02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:37.320
according to the dolphin developers, they said that we've been notified by valve, um,

02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:42.120
that the Nintendo has issued a cease and desist, fighting the DMCA against the

02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:47.160
dolphins steam page and had removed dolphin from steam until the matter is

02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:47.720
settled.

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:52.600
Um, they're currently investigating their options and we'll have a more in depth

02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:53.760
response in their future.

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:56.160
It may be just like some of the stuff that's on there.

02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.520
Uh, but according to, they said the legal notice is they accused dolphin of using

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.560
cryptographic keys without Nintendo's authorization and decrypting ROMs at, or

02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:08.240
immediately before runtime.

02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:08.840
Wow.

02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:10.560
So, all right.

02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:13.560
Well, we'll just have to use all the other ways to get that.

02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:18.240
It's not like you can't get that thing on a steam deck if you don't know if you, if

02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:19.920
you know there's ways to do it anyway.

02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:20.600
All right.

02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:23.320
Thank you all so much for listening to orange launch radio this week.

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:25.400
Thank you for downloading the show or listening to us live.

02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:28.520
However you consume the show, I'm sure you heard it earlier in the show.

02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.880
It's, it's hard to stick out sometimes and it's hard to, um, you know, go against

02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:36.080
all these very large corporate podcasts.

02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:39.880
So we appreciate you for finding us on our little portion of the internet and I

02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:40.960
hope you enjoyed what you heard.

02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:44.760
Um, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are

02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:46.080
the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:47.880
We need more voices to put out there on air.

02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:51.960
Um, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever you heard

02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:55.480
this podcast, they go an awful long way and we really appreciate it all.

02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:58.560
Um, so with all of that, let's get final thoughts for the night.

02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:00.320
Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:07.080
Well, thought is, uh, I'm hopefully going to keep, I need to keep a pace to get all

02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:09.040
my stuff done for the end of the season.

02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:11.480
So, but yeah, the next episode is going to be cool.

02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.000
All right, awesome.

02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:17.920
Um, my final thought is I had a great time at my work conference and there's stuff I

02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:22.520
learned there that I feel like I can apply to the stuff I do here and throughout my,

02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:24.640
the rest of my life as well, which is always a great feeling.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:30.240
Um, and, um, number two, Diablo four comes out this week and I'm fucking excited as

02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.440
somebody who's been a Diablo fan for a very long time.

02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:35.320
So it is going to be a great gaming week.

02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:40.160
The big summer of gaming begins right now and it is exciting.

02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:43.560
Oh, and third, I'm taking a third final thought cause we missed last week.

02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:48.920
Um, you'll notice tonight I am wearing my pride, uh, wristband here on my Apple watch.

02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:54.040
That is because pride month, as far as I'm concerned, has officially been extended from

02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:55.920
Memorial day to the 4th of July.

02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:56.280
That's right.

02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:01.240
There's been an extension on pride month because of all the fuckery, these assholes

02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:02.600
out there keep putting us through.

02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:08.600
It is very clear that one month is not enough for us to say we're here, we're queer.

02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:09.720
Get used to it.

02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:12.760
And on that note, I'm going to roll the credits.

02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:14.160
Have a wonderful week, everybody.

02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:14.680
We'll see you.

02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:15.160
Good night.

02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:44.160
No, they were all still.
