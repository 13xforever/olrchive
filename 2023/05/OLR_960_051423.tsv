0	30000	No single gaming news outlet took down the behemoth that was E3, but it was the era of streaming that enabled publishers to cut out the middleman. Just like the internet revolutionized direct sales, right? Now we call online shopping, Amazon. Who will be the replacement for E3? PAX already was, because E3 was never for the people. Any takers on bets for PAX Southwest? This is the Kick'em While They're Down update, now it's time to go.
30000	60000	It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you this week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	90000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining us tonight as she is every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers. Hello. Hello. How are you? I have a little bit of a headache, but I'm okay. Okay. Is that why you're not on cam? Because I wasn't sure. Oh, shit. Hold on. Yeah, no worries. You're good. Well, let me also quickly say hello. We got it. Let me also quickly say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you? I'm fine. What is
90000	120000	the game playing behind you tonight? Dude, was it Dodonpachi? Oh, yeah. Okay. All right. I'm almost positive. I'm almost positive DarkSakura has done that as a classic game of the week at some point in the history of this program, which is tonight- I think I've done Dodonpachi. I don't know that I've done Dodonpachi. Gotta check the wiki. Did you know this show has its own wiki? And I I've rarely touched it. I maybe edited one thing that had to do with like an episode numbering or
120000	150000	something. But yeah, it's pretty awesome. I actually always forget the URL now. Because to me, it's orangelonsradio.wiki.com. But at some point fandom.wiki. So maybe it's .fandom.com or something. But it's there. And thanks to those that do that. I also am calling out Loki's video because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. That's VOG network. Nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
150000	180000	So there, that's that's everything. Here we are tonight with episode number 960 of our show. Not going to be here next week. Sorry, I know it's a very random week, but my day job is getting in the way. So you know, it's- I know, but you know, the the show that, you know, pays the bill so I can- or excuse me, the job that pays the bill so I can do this show. A little more important with that. So we will be back in two weeks, but we're gonna make it an extra good show tonight, even though I feel like there's far
180000	210000	less news this week because I think everybody's been busy playing Zelda. I don't know if y'all are aware, but a little game came out on Friday called Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. It is the sequel to Zelda Breath of the Wild, which of course was a launch title on the Nintendo Switch as it came out in tandem with the Wii U, where the game originally started development for and years ago, Nintendo teased this sequel that finally was released to the masses.
210000	240000	This last Friday, not that plot details in the game wasn't leaked before that. But we don't talk about that under fear of being slapped in the face by Nintendo and their lawyers. That all being said, I have a feeling here on the panel, we haven't touched a lot of Zelda, but I'm going to get into that in a minute. So Dark Sakura, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom launched. Have you had a chance to check it out? Or what's your what's your hype level for it? Tell us about where your head's at with Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
240000	243680	We have it and I immediately went to go spoil things for myself because that's what I do.
245200	249840	Hey, if you do it, no one else can do it for you. It's taken the power away.
250800	255200	The reason why I like doing it myself is because there's certain aspects of things that I would be
255200	260480	interested in. And seeing it happen in real time doesn't really take away any of the excitement for
260480	266640	me. It's a little bit different, you know, if I was just going to watch a complete and total playthrough
266640	273200	of the whole thing. But I've been going and looking for like specific things, you know. And so
273200	279280	those specifics are like the little things that I kind of use as like a mental checkpoint for
279280	286240	what I want to get to in a game. And it motivates me to keep from getting the really quick game
286240	291600	burnout that I tend to get. Gotcha. Which is why I'm still playing Dead by Daylight because I'm
291600	297360	trying to do achievements and stuff. Oh, I'm playing with my friends. I love my friends.
300400	311840	Or as Shay says, I love you. But yeah, I'm happy with some story aspects to it and the attention
311840	320080	given to certain people. In chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Tiger Claw asks,
320080	327040	with a title like that, were people in tears playing it? Fess up chat. Who in chat has cried
327040	330480	playing Tears of the Kid? I've cried playing a video game. Of course I have. You know,
330480	336480	there's video games that are very emotional. Oh, the end of the first disc of Lost Odyssey.
336480	343600	I thought I was going to barf. The ending of Mass Effect 3, especially the extended cut DLC.
343600	346480	I thought I was going to throw up from crying.
346480	351520	Hey, there's a reason that I always do the destroy ending.
353200	358240	Misha in chat is the first to fess up saying me. And for totes different reasons, which I can't
358240	364720	say because spoilerinos. So I respect that. Loki, what about you? I think we were talking a little
364720	369840	bit before the show. Your kids are old enough now where they kind of get into Zelda games.
369840	376000	So your kids will play Tears of the Kid. My youngest, he's into Zelda. He's been
376000	382720	playing a ton, so he is looking forward to it. And he's been playing it constantly since Friday
382720	387840	when he got home from school. So he likes it. Yeah. There were people that took off work on
387840	394000	Friday legit to play the game. Of course. I mean, I've done it. In fact, I'm actually on the fence.
394000	398800	I might try to take a day for Final Fantasy 16 because it is right around my birthday,
398800	404960	so I can take like a birthday day off, but we'll see. We'll see. Yeah. Yeah. I have not
404960	410720	played it yet. I got to be honest. I'm having a little difficulty swallowing the $70 price tag.
411360	420720	Although I saw a great life hack online, which is if you buy $100 of eShop credit at Costco,
420720	426400	it actually only costs $90. And it's the same thing with PlayStation. Because I did that to
426400	432000	renew my sub, and I think I've used the rest of the money to put towards theater them.
432960	440000	So you can do that. And then you use the $100 credit that you only pay $90 for to then get
440000	447760	the two-in-one game deal that they have for Nintendo Switch Online members. So you're
447760	452560	getting two games for $90. So that makes the... Yeah, you can be ordered on Amazon and get their
452560	460080	pre-order bonus. What were they offering for pre-order bonus? They have some deal where you'd
460080	466960	get a certain amount percentage off for doing your orders on their site.
467760	474240	Okay. Alan Alchemy, my husband's in chat. Hello. Saying some Costcos also just have the digital
474240	479360	code for it for $59. So that's... Because usually when you think Costco, you don't think sales on
479360	486480	one item. You think like, oh, I've got to buy Zelda and Mario and Kirby and take it both discount.
487200	492880	The package that Zelda comes in though is like the size of one of those large toilet paper
492880	495840	packages. So there's that. I guess.
495840	504480	But aside from that, it's basically the same. Interesting. All right. So I have not gotten
504480	507920	a chance to get around and play the game. Obviously, the $70 price tag. I know the game
507920	513360	is probably worth it, but I'm going to be honest. There's a lot of other games coming out the next
513360	517920	couple of months that I know I'm going to be super into. And I just didn't get into
519200	524160	Breath of the Wild as much. And that's not to say... And I want to go on record here.
524160	529120	I'm not a hater. I understand why people love these games. I understand why this is the game
529120	536000	of the year for people. Me, I am so bleep and frustrated at the weapon degradation system in
536000	540400	these games that it kind of takes me out of the experience a little bit. Like, I...
541360	545920	Yeah, I'm just... So I'll get it at some point.
545920	550160	You know, it's basically the combat, the weapon degradation, except it's more...
552160	555920	There are more steps and it doesn't really combat weapon degradation.
556480	561840	You know, for me, it's just like, I don't... I'm sorry. A $70 game doesn't run at 20 FPS sometimes.
562800	566160	Oh, is that what we're talking about is performance issues with the game?
566800	570160	Of course, it's on the Switch. I mean, yeah, there's going to be performance problems,
570160	572560	but we're going to give it a pass because it's Zelda. But like,
574400	580960	the hardware is not meant to run this. And that's fine because I guarantee that this is another Wii U
580960	585520	Switch type of scenario where it's like, oh, yeah, we're releasing it now and it runs okay.
586080	590320	But then the Switch 2, when it comes out next year, oh, it's going to run really good on that.
590960	595840	Like, they're going to sell it to you again for another $70. Oh, well, maybe $60 if you bought
595840	600160	the Switch version, assuming that, you know, the digital storefronts talk to each other because,
600160	602640	you know, internet's so complicated nowadays.
603440	608160	Honestly, I think, Loki, you bring up a point that does kind of frustrate me with Nintendo
608160	612880	in general. Like, I'm going to be honest, like, although I understand a good game does not have
612880	619200	to be 4K, 60 frames a second. And so again, I don't shit on Zelda for these reasons. But there
619200	626480	is a part of me that's a little bit like, like, sometimes I understand the people that are like,
626480	633280	I wish Sony would buy Nintendo and put Zelda on the PS5. Like, honestly, sometimes they have a
633280	640160	point. Like, the emulators run it better. Just saying that's that's a weird scenario that game
640160	645680	first thought that your current console is being emulated already, and that it's being emulated
645680	651680	better than the actual console while the console is out. That's like, that tells you how underpowered
651680	656480	the Switch is. I would really I would be let me put it this way, I would be more excited about
656480	661440	Zelda. Here's what will get me to buy the new Zelda right away. If they put out an
661440	665440	higher power switch next year, as a lot of the rumors are swirling around if there's going to
665440	671200	be a higher power switch because it's so obvious. These last gen Switch games are like low end PC
671200	676400	specs. You know, like we're playing these games to the minimum qualifications. It's weird.
676400	682160	There was there was comments from some screen manufacturer that's making screens for it already.
682160	684800	So like that there's something coming.
684800	692160	That's that is going to get me to get Zelda honestly. That that's going to do it. I you know,
692160	697120	and maybe it's because this is important too. And I know this separates me from a lot of people out
697120	702320	there. A lot of people love the Switch because they can take the games portable and play in
702320	707920	handheld. And I've always said on this show, I rarely do the handheld gaming thing rarely when
707920	714160	it comes to consoles, because I'm always playing the phone game AR stuff. That's no problem for me.
714160	720800	But I don't play a lot of portable games. I play my Switch docked like 95% of the time. And I think
720800	725280	that's very important if you're trying to put yourself in my shoes about why didn't Rob get
725280	729360	Zelda the first day that it all kind of comes into that I think a little bit.
729360	736720	Anyway, knowing that we here did not spend our entire weekend playing Zelda like many of you out
736720	743600	there. This is the show where every gamer has a voice. So earlier today, I went to ye old social
743600	750000	media and our Twitter account over at twitter.com slash O L R. And I actually asked I said, Hey,
750000	753760	listen, those of you that have been playing Tears of the Kingdom this weekend, what are your
753760	760640	thoughts so far? So let's hear from some of our listeners over on Twitter. Michigan said, to be
760640	764800	H I honestly love this one over Breath of the Wild because there's so many new things in it that
764800	768560	weren't in Breath of the Wild. It's a bit harder for me than Breath of the Wild, but I'm still
768560	774480	having fun. And the environments are so cool and the things you can do as well. Dr. Tzuyu said so
774480	779040	far it feels like a great expansion to everything they built in Breath of the Wild. The Mrs. and I
779040	783040	have barely scratched the surface, but playing around with the new abilities has been fun.
783040	787680	Definitely raised the difficulty in a second quest kind of way though, at least it feels like
787680	792720	it. Oh, that's interesting. I didn't realize it was supposed to be a harder game. Mike Deft tweeted
792720	797120	us saying I've been playing it on and off and having to relearn how everything works and
797120	801600	exploring a new but familiar world has been like experiencing Breath of the Wild all over again
801600	808480	for the first time. And I'm loving it. The hype is real and it's here. Flaco Jones, haven't heard
808480	812320	from Flaco in a while, hope you're doing well, tweeted us and said I've just scratched the
812320	817680	surface, but it's great so far. The story really takes off in the opening minutes and I can't wait
817680	822240	to learn more. I have heard the opening to the game is really good for what it's worth. It looks
822240	828000	like it goes deep into Hyrule lore and I am here for that. I'm hearing similar sentiments quite a
828000	833760	bit. Dungeon Buster tweeted us saying enjoying it so far, the build system is sometimes like
833760	840880	and attached a gif from Kamen Rider of a girl with a bazooka firing at what appears to be a group of
840880	846000	mobsters. So there you go. That's the best way. That's my best translation of that gift to radio,
846000	851040	but those of you on Twitch can see it. Okay. Here's an interesting comment from our pal,
851040	857600	Shane, who says I am bored. I'm not terribly far just outside the intro area and it just feels like
857600	862320	more Breath of the Wild. Good for people who love Breath of the Wild, but I don't feel the same
862320	867200	excitement each time I've started it up that I felt was Zelda games pre-Breath of the Wild.
867200	873600	I don't feel the rush to see it's to its end. So that's the first comment of a maybe not glowingly
873600	877280	positive that we've heard here on the show. This is also interesting. I'm going to come back to
877280	881440	something that's set in here later, actually. And we also have a name I haven't heard before,
881440	888080	so thanks so much for tweeting us. Cashew LeCate says absolutely incredible, filled with surprises
888080	893600	and nostalgic callbacks. Story feels even more engaging than Breath of the Wild. Abilities,
893600	899120	though I was skeptical of some at first, are all amazing so far. I was hoping the user icon
899120	905680	was actually the picture of a cat named Cashew, but it appears to be some other type of art.
906480	910160	We also had one more tweet here from Straying Will. I don't think I've seen this name either,
910160	917360	so hello, hello. Says I had never cursed as many times at a single shrine in my entire life. So
917360	922480	yeah, it's been good. So for the people who love to bang their head against the wall of difficulty
922480	927520	on some of those, people are enjoying it. So again, it sounds like most of what we're
927520	934240	hearing there is pretty positive, but there's that one outlier, right? So this is interesting
934240	941440	because go to some of the reviews for this game. Now look, I don't always love to put stock in
941440	946960	Metacritic, but I have to use it here to make an example of something here. So let's go back to
947600	953360	looking at this game on Metacritic. Let's be real, this is an amazing Metacritic score. No
953360	961360	matter how you feel about these type of websites, to see a game score this high with 87 positive
961360	970960	reviews and one mixed review and zero negative reviews is pretty astounding. User reviews don't
970960	974560	matter. We're not paying attention to user reviews because they're always terrible on these sites,
974560	979280	even though they are for the most part, for what it's worth, leaning overwhelmingly positive as
979280	984720	well with some outliers in the negative. But I want to focus on this for a minute,
984720	990560	because this one outlet that dared to do a six out of 10 review on the game, or this might actually
990560	997120	be a three star review, I'd have to take a look, was getting a lot of flack on social media this
997120	1003600	week for daring to give it a score that's not 10 out of 10. I hear the sigh, Loki. What's on your
1003600	1009680	mind with this? It's just, it's just stupid. And I saw, yeah, I saw the Kotaku article calling them
1009680	1015040	out later. Oh, look, they didn't raise the point. There was a call out article. I didn't know that.
1015040	1022640	Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's a call out article. It says, Oh God, I'm trying to find it now.
1023520	1029040	But yeah, I was just surprised. Like, I'm like, really? Like, really, you're calling out another,
1029040	1034240	another outlet because they didn't rate it a perfect score. I'm sorry, people have opinions
1034240	1038400	about games, there may not rate it a perfect score. And the same thing happened last time. I
1038400	1044880	remember it was that James Stephanie Sterling was having issues because they gave it a seven out of
1044880	1050800	10. And everyone's like, how dare you not give it a 10 out of 10. Like, he's like, they were just
1050800	1056800	like, I like the game, but I just didn't think it was a 10 out of 10. Like, I don't know, like,
1056800	1061200	what's wrong with people? And they will like attack these people? Because how dare you not
1061200	1065360	like the game as much as I like the game? Right? Right. I don't know.
1065360	1069520	How dare you not validate my opinions, even though I have no value in my own opinions?
1070320	1076320	It's ridiculous. And to be honest, like, I think the coverage on Kotaku is more of like,
1076320	1080880	it was a slow news week. I mean, how many Breath of the Wild stories were there? Yeah.
1080880	1086080	And we we also know that particular website has a little bit of a beef with Nintendo that,
1086080	1092400	you know, and some of it really shows in some of what they're, you know, and I think I don't know
1092400	1095840	what they're getting clicks out of it. They're trying to get clicks out of it. But we all know
1095840	1101760	that that website has some history with Nintendo that some would question the professionalism of
1101760	1105840	how they're dealing with it. But I'm sure from their perspective, they are just saying,
1105840	1109280	if Nintendo wants us to shut up, they'll make an agreement with us again. They'll get us to sign
1109280	1113120	an NDA again by giving us what we used to have. That's that's what they're doing from their
1113120	1118000	perspective. But anyway, I digress a little bit. I want to go back to this website because it was
1118000	1123600	interesting because I saw a comment on social media about this website. The website's name is
1123600	1132640	Gfinity. And I saw an interesting comment that said some no name website gave this a six out of
1132640	1140320	ten to just for the clickbait. And I actually. I kind of that struck a nerve with me, actually,
1140960	1145840	and maybe it's because I've heard this podcast referred to before as a no name podcast.
1146720	1151040	But again, what makes this individual's review any different from your review?
1151920	1159760	Why does this individual in this website's review? Why is this any better or worse from what other
1159760	1164800	websites that do get lots of clicks such as the ones we were just talking about do? And I want to
1165760	1171440	I'm also curious, too, because I actually read the review and there was a part of me that was like,
1171440	1175520	I'm going to be honest, I was like, I don't know if this sounds like a six out of ten.
1176240	1181920	It sounds like a seven out of ten, though, because for the most part, it did point out a lot of like
1181920	1186320	the things about it. But there was a section of this I thought was very interesting towards the
1186320	1192240	end, especially in light of some things we were just talking about. I'm going to quote from this
1192240	1197840	review. Again, the website is Gfinityesports.com. I'm sad to say that The Legend of Zelda Tears of
1197840	1202240	the Kingdom just isn't worth the wait for me personally. It takes too much from the one title
1202240	1207200	in the series, it took me years to finish, and does too little to reinvigorate the classic Zelda
1207200	1213520	magic back into its reused world. So this sounds a little bit like somebody who misses some of the
1213520	1220240	older Zelda games. I can identify with that. I love Zelda games that are more in line with,
1220640	1224960	Super Nintendo and Nintendo and the things we saw in that era. So I could understand maybe
1224960	1229680	that frustration there. It builds upon the divisive foundations of Breath of the Wild
1229680	1234800	to a point where those who love the open world adventure will genuinely find a lot to like.
1234800	1239200	But it really is just more of the same to the point where I suspect even the loyalists
1239200	1244400	will be a little downtrodden as they slowly tread the same path around Hyrule. If the original open
1244400	1248240	world adventure left you feeling a little deflated, Tears of the Kingdom is unlikely
1248240	1253120	to convince you that it's the best way forward for the franchise. Now if you weren't aware,
1253760	1258800	a lot of these comments are coming from the fact that apparently they did reuse the Breath of the
1258800	1263360	Wild map for Tears of the Kingdom. However, there's a lot, I mean it makes it sound like
1263360	1268960	they copy pasted it, no no no, far from that. There's a whole underground area, there's
1268960	1273760	obviously these new things such as the classic dungeons that didn't exist before. So it would
1273760	1279680	not be fair to say it's the same world, but it is definitely a familiar world, I think is a fair
1279680	1287440	way to put it. And by the way, this comment, did you notice, very similar to our outlier comment.
1288400	1293040	It just feels like more Breath of the Wild. Good for people who love Breath of the Wild,
1293040	1297680	but I don't feel the same excitement. I've started it up that I felt with Zelda games pre-Breath of
1297680	1304160	the Wild, our pal Shane pretty much said the exact same thing the 6 out of 10 review does.
1305360	1307440	Does this make Shane's opinion any less relevant?
1310720	1317680	Food for thought. Look, and at the end of the day, and again I know I'm spending a lot of time
1317680	1325600	highlighting one borderline like 6, 7 out of 10 review here, it doesn't impact the fact that this
1325600	1330880	game has one of the highest Metacritic scores I have ever seen, and it certainly doesn't impact
1330880	1335920	the fact that those of you out there who love the game are still gonna love this game. And you're
1335920	1340560	probably sitting there kicking like, there's much more than Breath of the Wild and there's all these
1340560	1345120	different things and the durability system is better with a few, that's fine. That's great.
1345920	1351760	Because I realize there's a lot of games I play, say Final Fantasy XIV, that a lot of people don't
1351760	1358240	want to get into for a variety of reasons. And that's okay. People's like or dislike of that
1358240	1366800	doesn't necessarily lessen my love of that game. To me, I kind of have the whole feeling of like,
1366800	1373200	you know, when you're like, you're eating a sandwich and it's got stuff you love
1373200	1380000	on and someone's like, I don't like that. Like, so? What does that have to do with me enjoying
1380000	1389680	my sandwich? I literally didn't need to know that. I didn't need you being negative about
1389680	1396640	something that I enjoy. And vice versa. If I didn't enjoy something and someone around me
1396640	1403280	is like, oh, I loved this thing, unless that thing is gonna like hurt them, then I'll be like, cool,
1403280	1408480	glad you like it. What did you like about it? But in reading this review, I didn't get that
1408800	1414320	like, that's the tone coming out of it. Like, I felt they raised their case as to why the game
1414320	1419200	wasn't for them. And that, you know, if they are to be a gaming journalism website with review,
1419200	1423920	I mean, it's not like they've never reviewed a game before. You know, this was just one person's
1423920	1427680	opinion on it that happens to line up pretty accurately with the opinion of one of our
1427680	1433120	listeners. So there's people out there that feel this way. And that's, that's okay. But yeah, it
1433120	1437040	should, it doesn't mean, yeah, it doesn't mean you have to go around shouting on social media,
1437040	1444560	Zelda sucks. And if you play it, you suck. Like, okay, just go, go kick a rock, you know?
1445280	1454080	Anyway. Let's see. Shane is in chat or Shad Leland says, yeah, it's not like a bad game,
1454080	1460400	but I'm not, or it's not feeling like it's a game for me emphasis so far. So I wouldn't rate it
1460400	1468400	highly at all. Right. That's okay. Yeah. And it's okay to have like a discussion about it,
1468400	1475840	but certainly don't put people down for having a difference of opinion. Yeah. You know, it's using
1475840	1484080	my same analogy. You know, it's something like, Oh man, I really, I really like a carrot cake,
1484080	1489360	but I don't like it with raisins, which is true. Raisins to me are gross. And I'll, you know,
1489360	1493200	and I'm like, I like this, like, how dare you not eat it without raisins in it. Raisins are
1493200	1500480	a fundamental part of the recipe. No. Are you going to tell me, oh, I don't,
1501600	1506000	anyway, but you see my point. Yeah. Or you can tell me that a 10 out of 10 game
1506960	1510960	doesn't let you pet the dog. I'm sorry. That is not a 10 out of 10 game.
1512960	1517360	Uh, E3VL actually, when, when Jamie was making the raisin and carrot cake analogy,
1517360	1523760	E3VL said exactly where my mind went to as well. Pineapple on pizza. People make this out to be
1523760	1528400	like, it's the biggest debate of the 21st century is does pineapple belong on pizza.
1528400	1532480	And I was going on in the eighties. I've been asked this question before,
1532480	1535440	do you like pineapple on pizza? And you know, my answer to that question is
1536240	1542720	it's, it's not what I usually order, but I don't, I think Hawaiian pizza is a perfectly acceptable,
1542720	1549200	delicious pizza, but I'm not going to die on this hill. If you don't like it, don't eat it more for
1549200	1555840	me like that. And that is how I feel about pineapple on pizza. Like pineapple goes on
1555840	1561680	pizza. If you like pineapple on pizza, I usually don't like the other stuff that comes with pizzas
1561680	1566800	that have pineapple on them. Oh, they have a chain of pizza places over by us that has broccoli on
1566800	1572720	pizza. Yeah, that's actually, I've had broccoli on pizza before I had broccoli on pizza. And corn
1572720	1579600	with, Oh no, no. That's actually a Japanese thing is having corn on pizza. Yeah. I like potato on
1579600	1587280	pizza. Yeah. See, and yeah. And of course now the chat room is scrolling faster than it has all
1587280	1593360	night now that I brought up pineapple on pizza. Y'all, y'all are you, are you considering the
1593360	1600000	point I'm trying to make here? And dark soccer was trying to get to. For the record, I'm going
1600000	1607280	to say this about Chicago style pizza, just to refute SSJ 100, Matt. Okay. If pizza is a kind of
1607280	1617840	pie, then a Chicago style pizza is a type of meat pie. So technically it is considered a pie and not
1617840	1624640	a casserole because it uses a standing crust for its edges. I don't give a fuck what anyone calls
1624640	1631200	it. I'm going to eat it all because I love it. You can call it whatever you want. As long as it is
1631200	1640400	going in my mouth, the pizza. But that is just me saying that it does not count as a casserole
1640400	1646080	because it has the standing crust like a typical meat pie. The end. Anyway. I don't know. To me,
1646080	1651600	it feels like a pizza is less a pie, more of something you cut similar to a pie in slices.
1651600	1656640	I mean, that's just like almost like cutting a cake into slices. So pizza is a cake, I guess.
1656640	1663920	But like. I regret bringing up. I regret the food discussion coming up on this show again. All
1663920	1671600	right. Let me get into this other thing that I thought was very, you know, cute. That was.
1671680	1674080	New York style pizza isn't original pizza either.
1675920	1677600	Can I please get away from pizza?
1677600	1681200	There is only one original style of pizza. You have to have a margarita and that's it.
1683120	1687520	Are we done? All right. I want to talk about.
1691520	1692720	Let me mean it, Ranma.
1692720	1699520	I want to talk about some social media commentary from Xbox and PlayStation on the release of
1699520	1703680	Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, because no matter how you feel about the game,
1703680	1707440	it's a huge release. I recognize that people took the day off work for it.
1707440	1712080	There's a lot of folks really into it. And Microsoft and Sony took a minute to actually
1712080	1717360	acknowledge the release of Tears of the Kingdom, where the official Xbox Twitter account said,
1717360	1725200	Congrats, Nintendo on Tears of the Kingdom. We'd like to see the little handshake, good game
1725200	1730320	type of behavior, right? And the official PlayStation account actually tweeted,
1730320	1736000	Have fun up there Hylians with a little cloud emoji. It's not necessarily using the game's
1736000	1740800	name in full or who even made it, but we all know what they're talking about, whatever.
1740800	1747440	So it's nice to see a little bit of that. We've come a long way from the Genesis does what
1747440	1755440	Nintendon't days of the console wars of yesteryear. So if all these folks can get along,
1755440	1758560	why can't all of you when it comes to the console wars?
1759760	1763360	Xbox and PlayStation, that's fine. I'd love to hear what their opinions are,
1763360	1766000	but I'm more interested in what Wendy's had to say about it.
1766000	1771200	What did Wendy say about it? Did they make a McNugget panorama with
1773040	1775200	items from the game or something like that? I don't know.
1775840	1777040	I hope they said anything.
1778080	1781600	I'm sure Tears of the Kingdom will come up again later in the show. In fact, I know it will.
1781600	1787840	However, one thing I have to point out because I was sent this multiple times on social media
1787840	1793840	with some type of label that said, Oh, look, the time to penis in this game was less than 10
1793840	1800080	seconds. And sure enough, somebody out there made this creation using the crafting system
1800080	1805440	in Tears of the Kingdom that looked like a little person with a giant, you know what,
1805440	1808560	that was set on fire that looked like a sparkler on the 4th of July.
1809280	1812640	I don't believe it's against terms of service to use the anatomical name.
1814000	1816320	Penis. Penis, penis, penis.
1819360	1823040	I was going to say you could also, if you want to be tasteful, use phallus.
1824560	1827280	But anyway, I was sent that gift multiple times.
1828000	1830240	Yeah, they don't have it. Wendy said nothing.
1830240	1833280	Now you know what getting unsolicited dick pics is like.
1836400	1841120	The other thing I've seen is Koroks being crucified and then launched into space with
1841120	1842560	rockets. So that's a thing.
1843920	1848800	Oh, Def says I'm confusing what Wendy's does on social media with Arby's. Arby's is the one that
1848800	1851760	makes the complicated dioramas and stuff. Okay, my bad. My bad.
1852480	1854640	I love that Arby's does that.
1854640	1858000	I know it's the only good thing about Arby's because I sure as hell won't eat their food.
1858000	1865680	All right. Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks. Since we haven't been playing Zelda,
1865680	1869360	let's talk a little bit about what we have been playing in a segment called
1869360	1872320	How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1872320	1884960	It was. I played Midnight Suns, of course, because I love that game. I'm on my second
1884960	1891680	playthrough. I'm doing a light playthrough. And then I played, of course, some Dead by Daylight
1891680	1901360	with my friends. Had a good old time. And we tamed killers. I'm very proud of Fixie for having
1901360	1911680	tamed the Myers. Well done. Anyway, and of course, we got Tears of the Kingdom.
1913120	1920720	We're going to be opening that up. Played some World Cup soccer. We let Beatles go,
1920720	1927280	it's being sold to someone else. But our Weird Al will be here before too long. Yeah.
1927280	1930640	I was gonna say you're probably sad to see the machine go, but happy to see the money
1930640	1942400	come in to spend on new machine. I also played a little bit of Parodius for Famicom, a little bit.
1946720	1953040	Yeah, just been like, throwing things in here and there. I am bringing my retro night back,
1953040	1959040	but I kind of think I'm going to do Cult of the Lamb first, just so I can start a new game and
1959040	1965120	play through the DLC and get everybody in who wants to be in. And then I may go back to Star
1965120	1971120	Ocean finally. All right. Well, we'll go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?
1972720	1979680	It was most, I think I actually know it was all Minecraft. So I'm doing a lot of Minecraft stuff.
1979680	1986080	Put out an episode on Tuesday. We had our Channel 64 stream day yesterday. So I streamed in the
1986080	1992720	morning, and then did some errands of the family and then came back and streamed again in the
1992720	1999920	afternoon for my 1k subscribers thing. So we looked at some of the older worlds that I've
1999920	2004960	been in. So congrats on that, by the way, browse around. Yeah, thank you. Browse around like
2004960	2009760	different bases and stuff that other people made and stuff that I've made kind of rush through
2009760	2015040	that quite a bit. My wife was like staring at me like, have you played enough today?
2015840	2023360	It was. So, yeah, the bridge that a little bit. I've been busy, like actually doing more
2023360	2026880	Minecraft stuff right now because I'm trying to get another episode out here pretty soon.
2029120	2033920	So, yeah, there's that. And then, oh, yeah, it's fun. Still trying to get the 4000 watch hours.
2035200	2040400	It's going backwards now because it's year to date. And so I keep watching the number go down,
2040400	2045200	which is weird, though, because like, I'm getting like, quite a bit watch hours that I've seen,
2045200	2048800	but the numbers going down. So I don't know if they're just not counting that or like,
2048800	2054000	what the case may be there. Try not to obsess and just focus on putting out the content and
2054000	2056960	you'll get there. I know you will. You're talented. Yeah, it's gonna take a while.
2056960	2062880	I'm just impatient. That's all. So yeah, so I've been just working on that stuff. I got
2062880	2068640	the road masters in game now, at least some of them. So I actually I made a Minecraft mod. So
2068640	2073760	that was fun. So I did that. And we tell us more about this. You made a Minecraft mod.
2074400	2080480	Yeah, I made a Minecraft mod. So basically, I built a mod for fabric that will bring my
2081920	2088320	the models I had commissioned into the game. So they use what's called the single gecko live,
2088320	2096960	which is a animation, like a framework, I guess that allows you to do like different
2096960	2101360	animation things that are more complicated than just the Minecraft animations, because
2101360	2107280	Minecraft animations are kind of all math based. It's basically like, at least it used to be I
2107280	2114880	think they changed that recently with 119. But it used to be like you had said, Okay, this is going
2114880	2120960	to hinge back and forth type of thing, or it will spin around. And that's really all you could do is
2121040	2127200	make stuff swing back and forth or spin around. I think maybe I'll move stuff around as well. But
2127200	2134720	like it was very like basic animations, because it was have to be all stored. Like on like the
2134720	2141600	entities and everything. So they had it very basic. So this basically allows you to do a
2141600	2146320	traditional animation where you have keyframes, and you can do really complex stuff with it. So
2146320	2152320	the guy that I commissioned to do the so I had one person commissioned the designs for, you know,
2152320	2157360	my robot masters, and I had another guy take those designs and put them into 3d models. So
2157360	2163520	we have the first three done. And so I brought those into game now. So now I have a fabric mod
2163520	2169360	that I'm allowed to basically bring those in now. And then I use another mod called taters ends to
2169360	2174960	make them walk around. And one of them axolotl woman, she actually has voice lines, I used AI
2174960	2180640	to create voice lines for just because I, you know, I didn't want to pay yet another person
2180640	2187040	for voice lines right now. That'll come later. I kind of paid for voice lines, but it gets
2187040	2191920	expensive as it is already considering that only I really see it. I was gonna say this is why we
2191920	2195360	need to get you to monetization. So you could recoup some of the money that you're spending
2195360	2202640	on all this stuff. It's Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. Is it labor? I only noticed it. So there's
2202640	2208560	that. And then, oh, yeah. So yeah, this last episode, I built Moby from I think maybe a two,
2208560	2214240	three, I can't remember which being a man, Moby was a giant whale giant with the propeller fires
2214240	2220160	the torpedoes are not only torpedoes, but it's like missiles out of its back. So I built that,
2220160	2225440	which was huge. And then these giant cooling towers. And I have more cooling towers to build.
2225440	2231840	And then I moved guardians, which are these kind of fish things that have spikes on them and that
2231840	2240800	shoot lasers up their eyes. And so I moved those over to guardian man's area during the live stream
2240800	2247120	and actually named them after the people that were in chat during the like the whole live stream day.
2247120	2254560	So there's a bunch of those in there now, which is fun. And yeah, so it's been busy. So yeah,
2254560	2260400	right before we came on the show now I was moving an elder guardian, which is a real pain to move.
2261040	2266880	So that'll be that'll be the next episode briefly. Then I got to get into the brand new robot master,
2266880	2273760	which is golem man who's going to be a it's all like a stone quarry type of thing that building
2273760	2278240	so much smaller area hopefully get not that knocked out because we don't have a lot of time
2278240	2283200	left in the season for us. You know, no one to like give it away. But like, we're only estimating
2283200	2289280	like a few more few more months worth of time that we want to stay to like, finish up everything.
2289760	2294480	And so I'm trying to like rush to get everything done. And so I have to keep this like breakneck
2294480	2300960	pace right now to get everything because stupid me over scoped again. Oh, no, I do this all the time.
2300960	2307760	You think I'd learn by now. But it's fun. It looks cool. Everyone's always impressed when they come
2307760	2315760	to my base. Nice. So yep. All right. Cool. Let's see going to my gaming week. So some of the same
2315760	2320000	stuff I've been playing in the last couple weeks. Did one night of streaming stranger paradise
2320000	2323520	final fantasy origin this week. So continuing on that. And I played a little bit off stream
2323520	2328480	doing some side quests. So I'm ready to continue in the main quest. I don't think I have a ton more
2328480	2333040	to go in that game, maybe like three more streams, maybe, maybe more, maybe less. But I think we'll
2333040	2338320	get through that game pretty soon. So I've been playing more of that theater them as well. And
2338320	2342960	in fact, I think the next time I play theater them because I've been playing enough off stream
2342960	2347680	and knocking out the songs, I think next time I stream it, which ought to be Wednesday, because
2347680	2352400	I believe we get, if I remember the calendar right, I think we get our first Chrono Trigger
2352400	2359200	songs this Wednesday, I believe is slated as the DLC. Oh, I'm sorry. It may be Chrono Cross. It's
2359200	2365120	Chrono Pack. So it might be the Chrono Cross. Somebody is going to have to help me clarify in
2365120	2370160	chat what's coming this week, but I know some Chrono music is coming this week on Wednesday,
2370240	2378480	but I will also finally get the trophy for having played every song once. That is literally hundreds
2378480	2384800	of songs. So I'll finally get that on stream on Wednesday, probably. And then, you know,
2384800	2388720	I'll probably continue with trying to get some quests done and leveling. I finally got my first
2388720	2394400	character a star level. So you know, been, been doing stuff in that game still, which I've been
2394400	2400080	enjoying. Let's talk about some other stuff I've been playing. While you all have been playing
2400080	2407440	Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, I actually took a trip back and played a prior game of the year
2407440	2414320	recipient at a game that swept a bunch of awards two years ago. I finally sat down and spent some
2414320	2420160	serious time with a game called It Takes Two, which swept a lot of game award type of things
2420160	2426640	about two years ago. And if you're unfamiliar with the game, it is a meant to be a couch co-op
2426640	2430960	game, although you can certainly play it on the internet. But I think this game is a lot of fun
2430960	2435440	in couch co-op and that's how I played it. And I wasn't really sure what to expect. I just kind of
2435440	2441600	figured, oh, it's a platformer that is, you know, couch co-op. Is it really, you know, is it really
2441600	2445520	going to be all that? I mean, what all these awards? It must be pretty good. And yeah, I got
2445520	2451920	to say it's pretty darn good. And I think one thing I really enjoy about the game is that it
2451920	2460160	tells you just enough to get through puzzles. You know, it really walks that line well of
2460800	2467200	how do we make this challenging without giving it away? And if you're struggling, the characters
2467200	2473360	will talk to each other. And it's an interesting setup because basically if you're unfamiliar with
2473360	2477040	the plot, and I'm just telling you what you learned in the opening cinematic of the game,
2477680	2484160	basically it's about a couple that is divorcing and the child is upset that they're divorcing. So
2484160	2490720	she basically casts a spell of some sort to get them to play nice. Oh, you've played this?
2491760	2499200	Um, I haven't, but I've seen people play it. And it's adorable. And the dialogue is brilliant.
2499200	2502800	Yeah. And that's, that's the other thing is that the dialogue is smart enough.
2502800	2509600	If you're struggling on a puzzle or a boss, they start talking to each other. And if you listen to
2509600	2515520	what they're saying, it's a big hint about what to do, basically. So it walks that line really
2515520	2520480	well. But like we were doing some boss fights. So I played for like four hours with a friend of mine
2520480	2525520	and we got to like the, for those that have played the game, we got to the wasp queen for those that
2525520	2529840	know that. And that was, you know, kind of a weird fight to figure out at first, you basically have
2529840	2536080	to ride a rail around the queen's back and shoot. So one, and this is the other interesting thing,
2536080	2540240	as you progress throughout the game, your tools change out. And one of you gets what,
2540240	2545360	like in one setup, one of you has a hammer and the other has a nail gun, and you have to work
2545360	2549680	together to figure out how do you use these items together to get to where we need to go.
2550320	2556560	And then in this one particular stage, one of you gets a sap gun, which can also make weight. And
2556560	2564640	then one of you gets a flame launch, matchstick launcher that creates fire so you can blow up sap.
2564640	2570240	So in this boss, you have to like skate around to the back of the boss, sap it up, and then the
2570240	2574560	other person has to skate around the back and light it on fire. And that's how you damage it.
2574560	2579600	All the meantime, you can't both be on the rail, because if you are, then the wasps
2579600	2584240	get in the way. Somebody has to be down on the floor to basically attract the wasp attention.
2584240	2590960	So it's pretty darn intricate, actually. But when you figure it out, it makes it really rewarding.
2590960	2597120	And I think the varied system that come up in the game is why this game was so well received
2597120	2601360	and did so well a lot of the game awards. So anyway, I know I'm talking about a two-year-old
2601360	2607040	game, but I finally had, you know, I don't play couch co-op a lot. I'm a lot of times playing by
2607040	2611680	myself on the PC or maybe over the internet, something like Dead by Daylight, Final Fantasy,
2611680	2615520	whatever. It's very rare that I do like a couch co-op. So that was just a neat experience. And
2615520	2620160	I'm finally glad I did get around to that game. And we already agreed next time we're able to
2620160	2622880	hang out. This friend of mine lives in the Bay Area, so we can't see each other all the time.
2622880	2628480	But next time we hang out, we're going to try to finish the game. So that is something that's on
2628480	2636000	my radar. Let's see, E3VL in chat says, Can you play single player? I do not believe you can.
2637040	2643520	But if you want to check out another game by the same studio, Brothers, or what was the full name
2643520	2648000	of the game, Brothers, Something Journey, somebody in chat will probably yell it out. That one was
2648000	2654400	single player. I think it's like one person moves with the control, left control, one person uses
2654400	2660080	the buttons to move around. So- I think it's two analog sticks. One uses one analog stick,
2660080	2662240	the other uses the other analog sticks. Oh, I thought it was the buttons. A Tale of Two
2662240	2666480	Suns. Thank you. That was it. I knew it had a subtitle to it. Bobby Blackwell said this is the
2666480	2672640	F the Oscars guy, right? Yes, it is. And Tiger Class says they're supposed to adapt it as a
2672640	2679200	movie. I didn't get that at first. But now that I've played it and really immersed myself in the
2679200	2686240	story, I really could see this becoming a movie. Like it makes total sense now. I'm like, oh,
2686240	2691280	yeah, this could be a movie easily. And I think it could be a movie that does very well, actually.
2691280	2698160	So we'll see. We'll see. Other than that, I've been playing, of course, my phone games I usually
2698160	2704160	play. I hit level 75 in Pikmin Bloom. Haven't been playing as much Pokemon Go, though. I'm just
2704160	2709760	starting to feel the everybody else is over it. So I might be over it too kind of thing on that
2709760	2713440	game. But you know, I'm still I'm still a fan of Pikmin Bloom. And I've been walking today was
2713440	2719440	community day. So I walked my 10,000 steps and got my little badge. But I want to talk about
2719440	2725360	another Niantic game that came out this week. It's a game called Peridot. Even though you might think
2725360	2729920	in reading it, it's peridot is usually what you would think of, but they actually have said it's
2729920	2734640	called peridot because the little creatures that you raise in the game are called dots.
2735200	2742160	A lot of people who are describing this game are calling it a mix of Pokemon Go. And by the way,
2742160	2747520	if that's the sentence on your triple A gaming website that's reviewing or doing oppressions
2747520	2753760	of this game, they have clearly not played the game. It has nothing in common with Pokemon Go,
2753760	2759280	except the fact that it has the same game maker. And it uses the point of interest system but not
2759280	2766320	nearly in the same way. In fact, actually, for all the Niantic adventuring to the various points
2766320	2772960	of interest in your town, it's actually not that critical to the game at all. In fact, if you lived
2772960	2777760	in a rural area, there's very little I think you'd be lacking in this game from not having a lot of
2777760	2785040	Poke stops or whatever around you. That all being said, the game is what it is, is it's a modern day
2785040	2792320	Tamagotchi. That's exactly what it is. And it is a huge tech demo and I will say an impressive one
2792320	2799040	for AR, which is a big direction that Niantic is trying to go. Basically, you pick up the game and
2799040	2803840	you have the camera shooting your room or whatever, and you have this little creature that runs around
2803840	2808480	your room and you can feed it, you teach it tricks, and you can throw like a ball and the
2808480	2814720	ball will bounce off of things in your room. You trace little circles on the screen and the
2815520	2822320	Peridot will jump through the hole and do a thing called scavenge. And it actually detects, is this
2822320	2829520	like a wall in somebody's house? Or is this grass? Is this sand? And based on what it is you're doing
2829520	2834240	a scavenge on, you may get a different reward, which is interesting. Also, you may have things
2834240	2840000	like little mini quests in the game to have your Peridot say hello to another animal. So yes,
2840000	2845840	you point the camera at your cat, which I did, and the dot actually walks up to the cat and will kind
2845840	2851920	of like sniff at it and do those sorts of things. And then you get your little thing or other people
2851920	2857280	and it does a similar thing with that as well. So honestly, the thing with Peridot is that it's
2857280	2867120	very much like a tech demo in the way that 1-2 Switch is a tech demo game for the Nintendo
2867120	2875520	Switch. So it's a very impressive tech demo type of thing going on here. Here's the problem with
2875520	2884880	Peridot, and it's a big problem. There's no game loop. There's no game loop. Like one could argue,
2884880	2889280	oh, the game loop is you should be doing the little quests and leveling yourself.
2891120	2897680	Actually, what I thought the game loop was going to be was you want to keep breeding the Peridots.
2897680	2904880	You want to keep making other Peridots to inherit other characteristics so that you can log in your
2904880	2909360	journal. And maybe that's the part that people think is Pokemon Go, but I guarantee you people
2909360	2914800	have not explored this because here's the part that's just going to make you go, what in the
2914800	2922800	actual fuck are they thinking? A nest to breed a new Peridot costs five dollars in the in-game
2922800	2929760	shot to breed one Peridot. You get one free when you load up the game for the first time.
2930640	2937360	I'm sorry, nobody is going to fucking pay that. Nobody's going to fucking pay that. And I can't
2937360	2945360	believe Niantic thought somebody actually would. Now, my understanding is in the beta of this game,
2945360	2952080	there were nest fragments that you could find to build a nest, and that was a way to breed Peridots.
2952080	2956320	However, that is missing in the current state of the game. In fact, it sounds like there's a lot
2956320	2962240	of things that were in beta that have been removed for the game's release. Now, you can call Niantic
2962240	2968160	money hungry all you want, and in this particular case, you wouldn't be wrong. But Niantic is simply
2968160	2973520	doing themselves a disservice with this because there is no game loop. I'm sorry, paying five
2973520	2979680	dollars every time you want to breed a Peridot, that is not a game loop. I'm not going to
2979680	2984880	acknowledge that by calling that a game loop. That is off the table. So, as far as I'm concerned,
2984880	2991600	there is no game loop in this game. Therefore, a Peridot has no lasting value beyond three days.
2992720	2998880	But I'll tell you, those three days, it's a pretty- it's kind of neat. Like, you'll probably download
2998880	3004400	this game and go, that's kind of neat. And then when you go, oh, I got to pay five dollars to
3004400	3010720	breed- okay, I'll delete it. I've seen everything. Boy, did Niantic shoot this fucking game in the
3010720	3016080	foot. Why even bother developing new games if they're just not going to put effort into them?
3017040	3018640	Money, I guess? I mean-
3018640	3023840	It's because, go back to what I said, it's the AR tech demo. And that's where they're really
3023840	3028240	going is they want that AR stuff to be their bread and butter. And that's, you know, well,
3028240	3033040	but as far as I'm- they're doing themselves no favors by setting this game up to fail.
3035280	3039680	Now, could they make some small changes and repair the state of this game? Yes,
3039680	3044880	but they need to do it fast. The only reason I hold out a little bit of hope
3044880	3049920	is that Pikmin Bloom was a little bit like when it first launched too, but they've done a lot of
3049920	3054480	work on it and trying to figure out what's the right thing to charge for what. And even though,
3054480	3059200	yes, it still has some transparent, oh, they're trying to get me to buy expanded storage,
3059200	3063360	you can still earn the currency for that expanded storage by walking. You just have to do a lot of
3063360	3068960	it. Or you can recycle other Pikmin. It's just, you know, you have to learn to let things go.
3069040	3074240	And, you know, there are other ways to get in the game. So, Peridot is fixable,
3074240	3078240	but in its current state, it's nothing more than a tech demo that's going to last three days,
3078240	3084880	and then you're going to be over it. I wonder if Niantic needs to get bought by another company
3084880	3092720	that actually makes games. And I've been one of their biggest supporters and champions here
3092720	3099120	on this platform, on social media, and so forth. And even I'm starting to be like, yikes.
3101840	3109040	I don't know what else to say. Dr. T and Chat says, I'm not sure if I'm 100% on board with
3109040	3112880	AI yet. I don't know if you meant to talk about AR because that's what I was talking about.
3112880	3117120	I don't know if you've seen the beer commercial, but some of it seems odd for lack of a better
3117120	3124720	term. No, I haven't seen that. And AR still is something that's in its infancy, but I can see
3125600	3133120	how it's getting there slowly. And I saw how it was getting there slowly. I remember several
3133120	3139120	years ago when Bobby Blackwolf had a developer hololens kit that I got to try, and there was a
3139120	3144160	really cool little demo that was like a detective game that you played in AR. That was really cool.
3145120	3151120	I know the answer. Microsoft needs to buy Niantic. That is what I want to happen. I want
3151120	3158160	Microsoft to buy Niantic. If Microsoft can't buy Activision Blizzard, then I want them to buy
3158160	3169760	Niantic. I said it. Anyway, that was my gaming week in a nutshell. So, we're going to move on
3170160	3175360	to some news, and then we'll, of course, get to your calls a little later in the show as well.
3175360	3179360	Dejirama S in chat says, Rob Roberts, whatever you're smoking, please put it down. Am I wrong?
3181360	3184080	Doesn't Niantic need help in making games right now?
3185520	3192080	Because Niantic has a lot of good stuff in the AR space that lends itself very well to gaming. Oh,
3192080	3198560	isn't this what Microsoft was trying to do with the hololens? But then they had to pivot,
3198560	3203680	and now they're not using it for gaming anymore, but they're using it for business, which tends to
3203680	3208400	be Microsoft's biggest bread and butter anyway. They pivoted it to that, just like they did
3208400	3216320	Kinect. Isn't that a great marriage waiting to happen? I don't know. But Niantic is probably
3216320	3221360	a really expensive company. I mean, despite all the facts, and they're also not publicly traded,
3222160	3227040	which is also extremely obvious, by the way. Niantic is not a publicly traded company,
3227120	3231920	and when you see all the mistakes they keep making when they should be writing so high,
3231920	3235600	it is so obvious they're not a publicly traded company, because the stockholders would have
3235600	3242560	thrown a fucking fit at several of these things that have come up so far. But anyway.
3244240	3248800	SG100Matt in chat says, I don't know how I feel about the idea of Niantic being better if they
3248800	3254560	got bought. I get it. I get the reservations. I really do. And I'm not a fan, usually, of big fish
3254560	3261680	eating bigger fish. However, I feel like Niantic needs a lot of help in making games.
3263120	3268320	Do you want to talk about NBA All World? Did you all forget about NBA All World already?
3268320	3273280	The game that they licensed with the national basketball? Do y'all remember that Niantic has
3273280	3283360	an NBA game right now? Yeah. Yeah. Niantic needs help. Anyway. Let's move on. Let's get into some
3283360	3289600	other headlines and what all is going on in the gaming industry. And then we'll get to your calls
3289600	3294240	and your emails later in the show. But first, some headlines. Loki, we'll go to you. Yeah,
3294240	3303040	so Valve's updated their Steam's code of conduct. So now it's added gambling as part of the code of
3303040	3310480	content that basically it's outlawing engaging in commercial activity is the actual bullet point.
3310480	3314960	Examples of such prohibited behavior include posting advertisements, running contests,
3314960	3320400	gambling, buying or selling Steam accounts, selling content, gift cards and other items,
3320400	3327120	and begging. So this is also targeting, you know, the CSGO skins, gambling stuff that I think they
3327120	3334240	even fought in court, as well as, you know, other, you know, unauthorized selling of accounts and
3334240	3342640	whatnot. So it's finally now on, I guess, on paper. So now they can ban people if they're
3342640	3350000	caught doing this, whereas before it was just kind of frowned upon. So it makes sense. They
3350000	3353360	don't want to run afoul with, you know, the gambling laws and stuff like that in other,
3354800	3360560	you know, countries. So it makes sense that they would add that as something they would ban people
3360560	3368480	for. Yeah, it's interesting because Steam has had a lot of, you know, on the storefront they've
3368480	3372480	had a recent kind of redesign. It's almost like they're trying to position themselves for
3372480	3376640	something. I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into it because certainly just wanting to
3376640	3380160	stay out of legal hot water is, I guess, good enough. But it does seem like there's been a lot
3380160	3384720	of activity on the Steam front lately. And maybe that's just as simple as the Steam deck seems to
3384720	3390640	be doing well, and we're probably going to get more of it. But it's just it's just interesting
3390640	3395200	timing. That's all with this. Do you think there's anything to read into that? Or it's just it's just
3395200	3396080	wanting to make sure that
3396080	3400720	Zachary Reality It's probably just to fix like some discoverability and stuff like that on the
3400720	3410560	storefront. You know, maybe making a little bit more of like a making it work better with like
3410560	3414160	the Steam deck for something like that, because they probably see the Steam deck as something
3414160	3420000	that they could sell a lot of. And so making the storefront maybe look better on the Steam
3420000	3425520	deck would be a possibility. I haven't seen a whole ton of changes. I mean, honestly, like
3425520	3431840	the storefront, it's not all that useful as far as discovering things. But I don't know.
3433040	3437600	The only thing I discover is all the adult games that they keep making it into that list.
3438240	3443600	It's like you just have to look at the names and you say, okay, well, that's interesting.
3444000	3447920	Zachary You know, it's funny. I didn't talk about it during my gaming week. But since
3447920	3452320	Steam got brought up, I saw a tweet that was talking about a game that came out on Steam,
3452320	3457520	and it's a free game. And that's honestly about all this game is worth. But it was it gave me
3457520	3464320	some tee hees. And that game is called Flappy Souls. And it's a mix of Flappy Bird meets Dark
3464320	3472000	Souls. And I played Flappy Bird already hard. I know it's like the physics in this game were
3472000	3477600	somehow even harder. And like I barely got very far at all. But I was getting souls for whatever
3477600	3483120	that's worth. So it's it was silly. But yeah, just just goes to show that like they'll put anything
3483120	3489520	on that store any these days won't they? Like here we Flappy Bird clones in 2023? Really? On my
3489520	3498400	internet? It's time to come back. So Mike Defton chat says I wonder if I'm still good at Flappy
3498400	3502720	Bird? Don't use this game to answer that question because the answer will be no.
3505280	3511840	All right. Let's talk about maybe a place where they can announce Flappy Souls 2. That is Summer
3511840	3517200	Game Fest 2023 is coming up. We've been talking a little bit about this, but this game is somewhat
3517200	3525200	on the horizon. It is happening on June 8 at 12 Pacific 3 Eastern 12 noon Pacific. It will be on
3525200	3530640	YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook, all the places you can expect to see a video. They are talking
3530640	3536160	about world premieres, gameplay demonstrations and announcements. And it will be in front of a
3536160	3542000	live audience. So for the last few years because of COVID lockdowns and so forth, and the world kind
3542000	3548000	of finding its balance after that, it's been 100% virtual and all that. But it will be in front of a
3548000	3554000	live audience this year just like the game awards were. So that's not a huge surprise. It will be
3554000	3561200	at the YouTube theater and I believe tickets are on sale now. Over 40 companies have been announced
3561200	3569200	as taking part. The list is too long. I will read you some highlights. Activision, Bandai Namco,
3569200	3576080	Capcom, Devolver Digital, Disney Interactive, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Gearbox, Magic
3576080	3586960	the Gathering, Microsoft or Xbox, Netflix, Niantic, Lord help us, Samsung, Sega, Sony
3586960	3594480	Interactive Entertainment or PlayStation, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Valve, Warner Brothers Games, which
3594480	3598320	might tie into something we're gonna talk about in a little bit. I didn't even name everybody.
3598560	3606160	Everybody is here except one. There's one company I didn't say who's not on the list,
3606160	3611120	which is actually a little bit surprising because usually they participate in Geoff Keighley stuff.
3611920	3618560	Nintendo. Nintendo's not there. They'll do their own thing. That's right. Nintendo does their own
3618560	3624640	thing right around this same time. But I'm still a little bit surprised they're not giving one
3624720	3629600	they're not giving one little nugget to Geoff Keighley, even if it's a like more of an indie
3629600	3634960	tone type of game or a smaller shadow drop release type of thing. I'm a little surprised at that,
3634960	3639920	but it is what it is. Well, they may not necessarily announce everybody that's gonna
3639920	3646640	be there if they really want to be. I don't know. We'll see. Who cares? Yeah, maybe. But I wouldn't
3646640	3653440	get the hopes up on that whole thing. So S.J.O. and Hunter Matt says the Disney and Square Enix
3653440	3660160	mention got folks excited. Oh, people reading into Kingdom Hearts 4. Maybe. But we also know
3660160	3666880	I would actually say, yeah, Kingdom Hearts 4 isn't off the table. However, don't forget Disney just
3666880	3674480	put out a pretty big Mario Kart clone on mobile phones that they are trying to enhance and make
3674480	3678880	that Disney speedster or something like that. So I imagine they want to announce something that,
3678880	3683280	you know, probably new characters, new tracks. I hear that game is very limited in tracks right
3683280	3687680	now. So probably want to announce like a little more of a roadmap for that game. And I would
3687680	3696480	assume Square Enix, it's time for the update on Final Fantasy 7 rebirth and what's going to
3696480	3702320	happen there. And if the game is actually coming out for holiday, release day announcement is
3702320	3709520	coming at this for sure. If it is not coming for holiday, we get the trailer that says that
3709520	3715520	suddenly, magically has a new release day 2024 in the trailer. So I really feel like
3716800	3721840	Final Fantasy 7 rebirth is what Square Enix is bringing to the table. We'll see.
3723760	3731120	So, all right. We'll find out on June 8th. Let's move on. Dark Sakura was something else out of
3731120	3736800	Nintendo's world. Yeah, and something that nobody should be surprised by because speedrunner is
3736800	3746240	going to speedrun. So as of two days ago, a speedrunner already beat Tears of the Kingdom
3747280	3756560	in 94 minutes. Now, I haven't checked for updates since then, but yeah, one hour 34 minutes and 33
3756560	3765920	seconds for a full speedrun without using an amiibo. And I'm just like, speedrunners,
3766640	3772960	why? Don't ruin it for us. It'll be fun to watch once they start hitting like games done quick and
3772960	3780400	stuff like that. I can't wait. But he went over some some tricks that were apparently available
3780400	3786480	in Breath of the Wild that Nintendo was supposedly fixed, but not really. They're still there.
3789280	3795440	Well, I mean, they're saying that, in fact, I'm just going to read a quote from the person that
3795440	3800480	did it. From what we can tell, almost none of the glitches that were present in Breath of the Wild
3800480	3808080	seem to have made it into Tears of the Kingdom, but they're still able to perform those glitches.
3808080	3812480	They just have to activate them in different ways than they did in Breath of the Wild.
3813760	3823040	And he used a lot of the the fusing ability, the Ultra Hand, which I love that it was named after
3823040	3836560	the old Ultra Hand. And of course, they're probably certain that they'll learn more
3836560	3843520	exploits and they'll be new tools. I mean, the one for Breath of the Wild was 23 minutes and 42
3843520	3849360	seconds. And I'm actually going to take a quick peek and see if this current time has been
3850400	3853760	exceeded or I should say, defeated.
3855680	3859600	While you're looking that up, Bobby, who, as you know, follows the games done quick stuff very
3859600	3864720	closely since he participates with that, mentions in chat Breath of the Wild started at 90 minutes
3864720	3868240	and now it's in half. And actually, it sounds like even more than that with what was just quoted
3868240	3877920	there. But Bobby also asked, how does this ruin it? Did somebody in chat say that? I mean, if I said
3877920	3886480	it, I was just being silly. Yeah. And people are going to play the games they want to play the
3886480	3891920	games however they want to play as long as they're not like maybe like spoiling the plot by getting
3891920	3896480	through it fast as long as you're not like copy-posting it out there all over the internet.
3896480	3905520	Yeah. And I didn't mean it was ruining it. It's just, you know, it's not a competition out there
3905520	3910400	unless you want to make it a competition. It was just saying it for a fact.
3912080	3916160	By the way, speaking of games done quick, I do want to give a quick plug because since we are
3916160	3921680	not out or since we are not here next week and we will be back on the 28th, I do want to point out
3921680	3927600	games done quick starts on May 28th, a little earlier in the day. And of course, Bobby Blackwell
3927600	3932160	from VOG Network is going to be out there doing some announcing. And he talks a little bit more
3932160	3936560	about the details on his show and on his social about when you can catch him during that.
3936560	3941200	But of course, we'd encourage you to support games done quick and, you know, all the great charity
3941200	3944240	and all the great speed runners that are going to happen, whether Bobby's in the hosting chair or
3944240	3950640	not. I actually know some other people. A friend of the show goes way back. You remember Asuka
3950720	3955440	from the tester years and years. I still follow her on Twitter all these years later.
3955440	3958720	She's there too, hosting and speed running, actually.
3958720	3959200	Nice.
3959200	3960640	So, yeah, so there's-
3960640	3962720	There's a lot of time, by the way.
3962720	3967200	There's a lot of fun people involved with games done quick. So I would definitely encourage folks
3967200	3975120	to follow that with starting in two weeks since we aren't here next week. So, yeah,
3975120	3980560	let's do one. Matt says, oh, wow, that's a throwback. And Bobby Blackwell says they've
3980560	3985760	been chatting for a few years and didn't know she was on OLR way back when. I would imagine she
3985760	3991120	doesn't talk about the reality TV stuff a lot. I don't see her ever bring it up on social media.
3991120	3995680	She was on another reality show, too. I can't remember the name of it, but that was years and
3995680	4001040	years ago at this point. So I'm sure she's forging a new path forward and totally makes sense.
4001040	4010640	Totally makes sense. All right, let's go back to something I hinted at in a previous story. Loki,
4010640	4015200	what could a new announcement be that's incoming at the Summer Games Fest?
4015760	4024800	Yeah, yeah, yeah. So NetherRealm is teasing that- well, teasing a new Mortal Kombat. And so they had
4025600	4031280	kind of a picture of a clock that's ticking down or ticking, I guess, down towards 12,
4031920	4038240	but then goes to one, which makes people think, oh, it's a new Mortal Kombat and it's going to
4038240	4040640	reboot the franchise. Again.
4041680	4044960	Again. I was going to say, Mortal Kombat 9 was a reboot, wasn't it?
4045680	4051120	Well, we're going to do it again. Well, 11 reset the entire timeline, so.
4052080	4055600	Let's do the time warp again.
4058080	4059520	So, yeah.
4060720	4063360	If that song isn't in the trailer, I'm going to be pissed.
4066240	4069200	Dr. Frank Infertile, DLC character.
4069920	4075280	Oh, not in that game. I couldn't stand to watch those horrible things happen to Tim Curry's
4075280	4079520	likeness. I could never watch that. Nothing more than a laser beam, please.
4080480	4087920	So let's see. Mike Defton Chat says, yeah, 9 was a complete reboot, making everything up that it
4087920	4092640	was a vision. Don't know the lore after that. Well, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, because
4092640	4099120	I can't confess that I follow Mortal Kombat lore super closely, but wasn't the main villain in 11,
4099120	4103680	aka Jennifer Hale, wasn't she like a time-based villain? Wasn't her thing?
4104560	4105440	What I just said.
4105440	4110960	Oh, sorry. Yeah. So what, I mean, it would make sense that maybe she
4111520	4113440	does something that sends everything, you know.
4113440	4114160	Cronia.
4114160	4118240	Cronia, thank you. She does something that does the time warp again, basically.
4119440	4125360	Well, no, she's defeated and whoever, there was either one or two true endings,
4125360	4130640	and that is either Liu Kang or Shang Tsung win and resets the timeline.
4130880	4131380	Hmm.
4132720	4140720	And like, it's, it's all kinds of shenanigans. Like, I mean, spoiler alert, it's already been,
4141680	4146640	the game's been out for a while now, but like, and I honestly think that the Liu Kang ending,
4146640	4151120	if it was going to be a real one would be the one because they're not going to go with,
4151120	4158240	you know, the shitty everyone dies one. But he went back to the original Kung Lao to start the
4158240	4158720	process.
4161280	4164320	That also explained, because a lot of people have been asking, if they're doing Mortal Kombat 1,
4164320	4168240	how are they going to incorporate the new characters? But it kind of seems like in that
4168240	4173840	layup, there's still a way for characters like, I don't know, Cassie Cage and you know,
4173840	4178240	some of the newer characters, Jackie Briggs and stuff could could be in it.
4179440	4184880	It's also just as an aside, it's so funny how many of those voices that I'm hearing
4185680	4190880	in Marvel's Midnight Suns, because Sindel's voice actor is Storm.
4191440	4192080	Oh, that's funny.
4192080	4193360	Who's the new DLC character.
4194960	4200160	Hey, the voice actor world is pretty small sometimes.
4200160	4207920	Yeah, I just recognize voices now. Like, it's like, like Shao Kahn's voice actor is a Ghost
4207920	4208420	Rider.
4208880	4209520	Oh, it's funny.
4210480	4218160	And Cassie Cage's voice is Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers. It's just so funny.
4219920	4222400	But I can hear them now. I'm like, I can't turn it off.
4223760	4229360	All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about a game. I don't know how I have a Stadia story
4229360	4235520	when Dark Sakura was our resident Stadia fangirl. But it's actually no longer a Stadia story,
4235520	4240240	because this has to do with a game that is going to be coming out for other consoles finally,
4240240	4245920	because it was a Stadia launch exclusive, a game called I don't I could see this pronounced guilt,
4245920	4251360	but it looks like Glit was a game that came out. It was a Stadia exclusive. And of course,
4251360	4255120	because it was exclusive to Stadia, you haven't been able to play it since January.
4255120	4262160	But it will be coming to other platforms PlayStation five and four, and Xbox series and
4262160	4268640	Xbox one, not the switch. But hey, those platforms will see the game release on July
4268640	4275440	six. It is a third person survival horror game from the creators of Rhyme Tequila Works. And
4275440	4281280	you're sneaking around a sally in a gloomy town and exploring the dark corridors of the school,
4281280	4286160	while evading monsters and looking for the missing cousin. So it sounds like it was a cute game,
4286160	4290720	it just maybe wasn't enough. You know, and this was obviously a lot of the, you know,
4290720	4296400	issues that Stadia had management wise, it wasn't enough to, you know, really turn heads to get
4296400	4302560	people to consider Stadia as their primary source of gaming. So but it's nice that the game will
4302560	4306960	get a chance to live on. Still had the best version of Cyberpunk.
4307520	4311360	Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, there. I mean, there were there were good things about Stadia.
4311920	4319040	And then there was Phil Harrison. Anyway, moving on Dark Sakura.
4320720	4333280	Well, in less good news, I mean, it's different news. Deviation games backed by PlayStation,
4334400	4343040	they have laid off around 90 members of their staff, people already posting about it.
4343360	4352080	It's very unfortunate, you know, that these people are having to go through
4353440	4361920	just another symptom of budgetary ineptitude. And I mean that on multiple levels.
4363920	4371440	But yeah, when they were signed on, they were over 100 employees at the time in 2021.
4371920	4378480	So that sounds to me like it would be the majority of their employees got laid off.
4378480	4384480	Oh, it's really shitty. And I feel bad for all the people having to
4385440	4389920	go look for work in an economy that doesn't look out for its people.
4391360	4397920	Yeah. Never like to report on that type of stuff. But unfortunately, it is what's happening
4398640	4408000	in the industry right now. So yeah, Mighty Moss is in chat. Hello. I believe this is a long,
4408000	4412480	longtime listener, first time chatter, who says, talking about the game I was just mentioning,
4412480	4417360	Glit is awesome. Shame it didn't get more attention because on Stadia.
4417360	4418000	It's Guilt.
4418000	4420080	It is Guilt. Okay, Guilt.
4420080	4420880	Not G-L-Y.
4422080	4427120	Gamers should check it out. Well, you'll get the chance July 6. I wonder if that was some type of
4427120	4431600	contract expiration with Google, but you would think all of that was out the window anyway.
4431600	4436000	Maybe it just took time to... Yeah, I guess if they didn't have a lot of notice about
4436000	4440240	Stadia shutting down or what that would look like, they do have to still go in and change
4440240	4445200	things because you have to change... When you release a game on PlayStation or Xbox,
4445200	4450720	the buttons have to look like the buttons on the controller. And they have to be called what they
4450720	4456080	are, whether it's the share button, whatever. You have to call things what they are on the
4456080	4461520	various controllers. That's all part of when a game goes gold. That means it's past that
4461520	4467360	certification process where it needs to hit a lot of criteria more than meets the eye sometimes
4467360	4473920	about releasing on those consoles. It's not sadly as easy. A lot of times it's just exporting in
4473920	4482800	Unity to a different console. Mighty Moss follows up saying, I think it was a porting and contractual
4482800	4486560	hold up with new platforms. Probably a little bit of both coming into play.
4487360	4491920	As Joe and Hunter Matt follows up on what Jarek Sakro was just talking about, the unfortunate news
4491920	4496720	about Deviation Games saying, the tech industry is getting hammered with layoffs. Thoughts are with
4496720	4502000	those folks. I would hate to be looking for work right now in the industry. Yeah, it's rough out
4502000	4506400	there. And then all you hear about are all these companies that think they can solve all their
4506400	4518000	problems with AI, when what AI is, isn't a new concept. We didn't have it on our show tonight,
4518000	4521120	but Bobby was talking about it a little bit on his show is that Bobby Kotek,
4522080	4530000	sigh, made a comment in a call with employees about Activision. Somebody was asking,
4530000	4534720	how is AI going to impact Activision? You know that employee was asking from a place of,
4534720	4540240	please don't do what Ubisoft is doing and try to replace quest writing with AI. But the response
4540240	4546160	was, oh, we could see a AI working in a game like Guitar Hero. And like the note charts could be
4546160	4554640	generated by AI. That's happened in games for a long time. And none of them were any good except
4554640	4558960	maybe Vib ribbon because Vib ribbon was cute and kind of had some other stuff going for it. But
4558960	4564000	like, I mean, the auto generated note stuff is never good in those games. Well, okay,
4564000	4571360	like it was built around random though. And Vib ribbon was like, how many years ago? Like, I mean,
4571360	4576560	I think AI technology has gotten a little bit better since then. Fair. And to be honest,
4576560	4583280	like you could use AI for like a Guitar Hero game to get a starting point. Like I think there's even
4583280	4588000	like different I want to say we like step mania had something where you could, you know, basically
4588000	4592480	throw something in there and it would generate kind of steps based off of like where it thought
4592480	4597920	beats were and stuff like that. And all that stuff is like, decades old at this point. So yeah,
4597920	4602160	I could imagine that. Yeah, they would do that. But they're never making another Guitar Hero game.
4602160	4609440	So that's off the table anyways. Yeah. So anyway, but it just, you know, kind of coupling that with
4609440	4615600	the tech layoff and all that stuff is that I swear you have all these idiots in C suites around the
4615600	4620800	industry who think that AI can replace these and it's just going to make the situation worse
4620800	4624320	before it gets better, unfortunately, because there's going to come a point where all this
4624320	4630160	shit backfires. All of it is going to backfire. It's just a matter of time. So
4630960	4634960	I kind of look at it like sort of having the automatic checkout units.
4635520	4638160	And how often do you have to call the clerk over to fix it?
4638160	4645680	Mm hmm. Kind of the same thing. There's always going to be a need for the human touch, I think.
4645680	4654000	Yeah. The first time AI drops a slur, and it's already happened. Remember the thing about Twitch
4654000	4659760	and the AI generated thing that was on there? And you can say, oh, they'll block those words. Well,
4659760	4665040	guess what? Society is coming up with new horrible things to call people all the time.
4665040	4671440	So as soon as AI drops something like that in a triple A game or what it's it's over.
4672880	4677680	Well, and on top of that, I mean, like, obviously, they wouldn't just generate stuff off the fly
4677680	4685360	with I mean, I wouldn't say always wouldn't be obvious. But like, let's put it this way. So at
4685360	4691040	least with the AI stuff now, and like all the companies talking about AI, I rather hear people
4691040	4696720	talking about AI than blockchain. So, you know, I'll give them that I'll give you that I will
4696720	4702080	give you that. So like, it's fine. Let's talk about AI versus blockchain. Because blockchain
4702080	4706560	is not going anywhere as far as like what you guys are going to be implementing with games like,
4707120	4714960	say, Oh, yes, let's unnecessarily add blockchain to this piece of DLC. You know, why? Oh, well,
4714960	4719520	so you can treasure doing games. Oh, that's weird. Because I think you could set that up
4719520	4725040	anyways, you know, if you wanted to, but I don't know, it's just it's silly. I would like to see
4725040	4729360	what they're gonna do with it. I do think it is a powerful tool. Will it be used poorly in the
4729360	4733760	beginning? Yeah, I mean, this is like look at any other like gimmick that's come out for consoles
4733760	4740720	and stuff. 3d for the 3ds motion controls. I mean, sure. Like in the beginning when there's games
4740720	4744480	first implementing that they don't know what to do with it. So it's gonna be garbage, but eventually
4744560	4748240	it'll get better. Until the next thing comes around.
4749680	4755200	All right. Well, let's move on with our next story, which I think is coming from you, Logie.
4756320	4767120	Yeah, so Annapurna, that company is actually parting ways with the studio behind gone home,
4767760	4777680	apparently following a toxic workplace. So the developer Fulbright, they said apparently their
4777680	4787440	co founder Steve Gaynor is made the studio a toxic cesspool according to the article from Kotaku.
4788160	4796240	And apparently, he had stepped away from that position as a writer back in 2021.
4798080	4805680	But I guess having more influence on the company has made it worse. And then of course, saying
4805680	4811760	he's also said that he's used the last two years to reflect and reconsider his working relationship
4811760	4818160	with the Fulbright team. But says the studio has been long developing and representing open roads
4818160	4825680	moving forward with publisher Annapurna Interactive taking over the front side of marketing.
4826640	4832640	So after a great deal of consideration, it's just no longer a Fulbright's place to represent open
4832640	4838320	worlds publicly going forward, it'll be credited to the open roads team at launch and will be
4838320	4844960	covered further here as much as I wish the game the best when it does come out. If you've joined
4844960	4849760	this newsletter and hoping for fresh info on open worlds, you should do yourself a favor and sign up
4849760	4857280	for the Annapurna newsletter on that front. For the record, Annapurna is also having a
4857280	4859920	pretty massive sale right now on Steam, just throwing that out there.
4860480	4862240	Oh, really? Hmm. Yeah.
4862240	4864240	Cool. Good to know. Love sales.
4865840	4869760	Sales are good. We should be getting like a Steam summer sale here probably in the next
4869760	4872880	few weeks, I think. Isn't that usually time to the Fourth of July?
4874240	4879680	Yeah, around E3-ish, I think. Sometimes they'll do stuff like around there. Summer games for
4880240	4881120	that time.
4881120	4885440	Yeah. Yeah. We'll probably see on the consoles, especially you'll probably see like if a game
4885440	4889680	gets a sequel announced, the original goes on sale. You see that a lot. So yeah, there's probably
4889680	4894240	some I noticed there haven't been a lot of huge sales on PlayStation lately. Like they have their
4894240	4899360	regular like, it's the May sale, it's the April sale. There's nothing like really big that they've
4899360	4903040	been pushing lately. So I feel like they're they're waiting on something. So we'll see.
4904320	4908320	All right. Let's move on to this story. This is a little bit about Twitch culture,
4908320	4912080	but I actually think this is really cool. As somebody who does, you know, obviously we do
4912080	4917680	this show on Twitch. I stream on a personal stream. Dark Soccer does as well. Loki's dabbled
4917680	4922880	in Twitch, but obviously he found a home on YouTube, which is fine as well. More platforms
4922880	4928880	makes more competition. And then you get new features such as what Twitch is doing, which
4928880	4936560	is a new clip editor, which makes it easy to make vertical style clips. So if you go into a clip in
4936560	4941760	the clip manager in your creator dashboard, you can do an edit and share clip feature that gives
4941760	4946960	you a tool that will help you to make vertical video clips. Why would you want a vertical video
4946960	4952480	clip? Because that is the way most people are watching their phones on platforms like TikTok,
4952480	4958720	Instagram stories, whatever, you know, a lot of those video on demand things are vertical. You
4958720	4963360	can choose to create a video that just shows the one portion of your stream or splits the view that
4963360	4967440	like putting your camera on top. There were already tools that help people do this for
4967440	4974240	TikToks. I know Alan had used some on his TikTok that, you know, he got some pretty good clips
4974240	4978640	out of it. He's Alan Alchemy on TikTok. I should give him a plug here. I rarely use TikTok, so I'm
4978640	4984640	not ready to share mine. But you can see that emotion. So it's nice that Twitch is kind of
4984640	4990240	building that in natively. You can also add your channel name to the clip and so forth. You know,
4990240	4994400	YouTube Shorts also, I didn't even think is another place where they do a lot of verticals.
4994400	4999280	So you can again, have some love between Twitch and YouTube. And this is again, just a place for
4999280	5005040	me to remind. It's okay, you know, as a Twitch streamer, it's okay if you don't have the money
5005040	5010400	to do subs. And if you don't have the money to do biddies, it's cool. We get it. Like, you know,
5010400	5015520	everybody's got a tight belt, a tight budget. It is really meaningful when you do hit those buttons
5015520	5021680	and you are able to do that kind of thing. But a way that you can show just as much love to a
5021680	5028240	streamer honestly, is by using that clip button. If you laugh out loud, use that clip button and
5028240	5033840	take 30 seconds to like crop the beginning and end of what was funny. And I tell you that goes
5033840	5037920	a long way. And by the way, I noticed some of you actually have done that with a couple of pieces of
5037920	5044640	tonight's show already, such as when, you know, I said the P word earlier in the show. Some of
5044640	5050400	you are using the clip button and that's great. I love that. Dark Sakura, I'm sure you love to
5050400	5054560	see when clips get made to your stream as well. And this is just another way that you can make
5054560	5058720	some of that portable. So this is great. I'm glad that Twitch incorporated this.
5060560	5064720	Oh, I can always use more, but sometimes people clip stuff. I'm like, why?
5065440	5070080	You know, I think sometimes people accidentally hit the button, especially if they're watching on
5070080	5074960	mobile because the make a clip button and the like large screen, but are right next to each
5074960	5079200	other. Cause I've done that. I've accidentally hit the clip button when I didn't mean to do it.
5079200	5082640	And then I I've even been asked like, what were you trying to make a clip of? And I was like,
5082640	5087840	I wasn't sorry. I'll make clips. I do make clips when I see funny stuff, but sometimes I'm like,
5088560	5097680	I didn't mean to do that. My bad. So anyway. Okay. Before we get to our next segment,
5097680	5102720	actually, I believe we're seeing some late breaking news coming in. Um, this is,
5103520	5108000	this is, yeah, this is really sad. Uh, we are getting a link. Thank you,
5108000	5113680	Tigerclaw for the heads up. We've got a link to a tweet from, uh, Tony Grayson at Grayson's Z80,
5113680	5120080	who says just heard about the passing of Brandon O'Brien, the original Crash Bandicoot voice actor.
5120080	5124320	Uh, it's a huge shock. I've been a fan of Brandon's for years. And recently he and I have
5124320	5131120	been talking about having a role in Anton Blast 2, absolutely gutted and blindsided. Um, R.I.P.
5131120	5137840	1962 to 2023. That was actually made this morning, but just brought to my attention. I was not aware.
5137840	5142640	So, um, that's a bummer. I'm sorry to end on a bummer, but that's, uh, that's really sad.
5143280	5150960	Like I said, the voice acting world is a small world and, um, yeah. All right. Let's try to
5150960	5155760	change the tone. Let's pick it up with something that is a fun segment that we like to do here
5155760	5158960	every week on the show. And I will let the bumper speak for itself.
5169520	5175120	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out
5175120	5179920	a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5181200	5184560	And what did you pick for us tonight, Dark Soccer, for the classic game?
5186000	5186800	Picked Fez.
5187760	5188240	Awesome.
5189600	5196640	Fez came out in 2012. It is an independent puzzle platform game. It was developed by
5196640	5206080	Polytron Corporation and published by Trapdoor. Um, so your character is named Gomez and he wears
5206080	5217360	a fez. Um, his, uh, world appears to be 2d, but it actually rotates around four different
5217360	5224560	two dimensional views to realign these different platforms and solve puzzles. And your goal is to,
5224560	5232800	um, yeah, fezzes are cool. Thanks, Pod Culture. Um, Doctor Who reference. Um, but you have to
5232800	5243040	collect these cubes and fragments to restore order. Um, and it was sort of low profile when
5243040	5251920	it came out, but it really, really, you know, got its own following and the game's been ported
5251920	5261360	elsewhere since then. Um, so, you know, Gomez lives in this happy little 2d world. And then,
5261360	5272080	um, there is, uh, this giant hexahedron thing that basically tears space and time apart and shows the
5272160	5282080	third dimension. And so, um, the game seems like it's resetting and then you can rotate between
5282080	5288880	the different views. Um, and so you explore quite a bit. You have codes and glyphs and treasure maps
5288880	5297120	and stuff, secret rooms. Um, and you don't really have a lot of guidance to go with. Um, you get QR
5297120	5305280	codes or tetronimos or all kinds of stuff, alts, you know, false clues and everything. Um,
5305920	5310880	the whole thing is that it uses a very limited palette and it's very pixelated, kind of
5311680	5319280	eight biddish in style and has a lot of nods to Tetris with the, uh, the, um, tetronimos,
5319280	5325280	but it has nods to Legend of Zelda, to Super Mario Brothers, you know, pipe traveling and whatnot.
5325840	5332080	Um, it has all kinds of different settings in there. And then it also has a new game plus
5332080	5341120	that lets you play first person. Um, and the game went through pretty long developmental, uh, cycle.
5342800	5352240	Um, it, it was, gosh, they said for Phil Fish, the developer, um, it took about five years to
5352240	5359760	make the game. Um, but I mean, once it was, once it was out, it won awards. It was, uh,
5360400	5371440	in PAX 2011, it got the PAX 10 selection. Um, it, Eurogamer basically, you know,
5372480	5380400	was all about the game. Gamasutra gave it positive ratings. It really, it really flew. Um,
5381280	5388880	and then, um, basically when it was released on April 13th, 2012, it sold about 200,000 copies.
5389600	5397760	Um, as long as it was exclusive to the Xbox live arcade platform. Um, and then, but Fish
5397760	5404400	had some problems with Microsoft studios as a co-publisher for not giving it a lot of publicity
5404400	5411520	when the game was released. Um, and so there is a pretty big dispute over how much it was
5411520	5419520	going to cost to patch FES. So after that, there was a Windows port. Um, and then after that,
5419520	5427440	we had an OS 10 and Linux, uh, port. Uh, then we had PS3, PS4, Vita, uh, came out after that.
5427440	5438720	Then it was, oh yeah, and iOS and iOS ports. Um, and that came out in 2017, uh, no Android port,
5438720	5450800	um, had been, been planned or released to my knowledge. Um, but basically the, the game was,
5450800	5459760	uh, actually wrote in a visual, uh, C sharp express and XNA game studio express. Um,
5461040	5469840	and it was done in Trixel, which converts 2d to four-sided 3d voxels, you know, basically
5469840	5479920	like different types of pixels. Um, but the game was designed in Photoshop with the software
5479920	5486480	converting it into 3d assets. Um, you know, most of the levels were designed by just using simple,
5486480	5496640	um, extrusion, um, which to just basically pull up from the flat shapes. Um, it had, you know,
5496640	5502560	all kinds of different stuff tucked in, um, you know, nods, like I said before, to Super Mario
5502560	5511120	Brothers and Legend of Zelda, and even to some of Miyazaki's, uh, open sky feel and, uh, to
5511120	5521040	Ico as well. Um, the music was done by Disasterpiece, um, also, uh, real name, uh, Rich Vreeland,
5522080	5530560	and it was very chiptune, electronic, um, and it really of course worked well with the game.
5531280	5537840	And then there were of course also tracks that had imitations of bats and thunderstorms and
5537840	5544640	taiko drum and, you know, water dripping off stalactites and all kinds of different stuff. And
5544640	5554960	there were, um, nods to, um, to other games and other movies like, you know, Lord of the Rings and
5555600	5565200	80s horror films and, um, some Legend of Zelda music, some Mass Effect, um, music. So, um, and
5565200	5572880	there's also a synthesized rendition of Chopin's Prelude, Opus 28, number four. Um, the song is
5572880	5582800	Continuum and, you know, lots of, uh, use of really classic, um, instruments as well, like a
5582800	5587600	mini-mog. If you don't know what the mini-mog is, it came out in 1970 and it was one of the first
5588720	5596000	home-sized, I would reckon, um, uh, synthesizers put out by Mog, um,
5597040	5603200	if you don't know how it's spelled, look up M-O-O-G, Mog. Um, which is also, by the way,
5603200	5609520	the full Mog is what Wendy Carlos used for Tron and switched on Bach.
5609520	5610240	Love Tron.
5610480	5616240	Yeah, she's awesome. Um, but at any rate, the soundtrack came out on Bandcamp and
5616240	5622400	basically flew off the virtual, uh, shelves and really good, really good soundtrack. Um,
5623040	5630880	and even, uh, someone was actually mentioning that they heard even references, uh, to, uh,
5630880	5637840	Pink Floyd and Soft Machine and, uh, Kraftwerk in some of the tracks. I thought it was really cool.
5638800	5645360	Love to hear the influences as they show up. Um, but like I said, it was generally favorable.
5646080	5654480	Um, it got for Metacritic on Xbox 360 89 of 100, but, uh, the other releases were between
5654480	5663600	90 and 91 out of 100. Um, most of them gave, gave, uh, eight out of 10 or higher for the rating.
5664400	5674400	Um, and even the New York Times, um, labeled it as a tribute to 1980s gaming as a, and also
5674400	5679520	said, and I'm going to read the quote here, lovingly almost excessively devoted to the
5679520	5685760	golden age of Nintendo. There were some that were comparing some of the aspects to Cave Story and
5685760	5695280	how well made that was. Um, even some surrealism thrown in there. Um, it's just very, very
5695280	5703360	interesting. The, the, the ties to other things that people have, um, you know, related this to,
5703360	5709520	I think it's, it's pretty nice. And then of course, Fez itself became, um, an inspiration
5709520	5718560	for a few other games, um, including Monument Valley, uh, Crossy Road, uh, Secrets of Rhyticon
5718560	5731840	and Tunic. Um, there was a announcement for a sequel. Um, it was a one more thing sort of item
5731840	5738960	in the June, 2013 Horizon Indie Game, uh, press conference, um, that was held at E3.
5739600	5745440	And then the project was canceled after Twitter argument between Phil Fish and a journalist named
5745440	5754560	Marcus Beer. Um, so that was it. It was basically canceled because of a snit.
5754640	5767040	That's your game. All right. The classic, classic game of the week is Fez. A lot of people, uh, in
5767040	5772400	chat commenting because, uh, you know, about Phil Fish and that whole thing, uh, you know, with the
5772400	5776640	movie and everything, which, you know, I guess maybe this game kind of almost took on a different
5776640	5782640	life in that regard. Um, but yeah, definitely, definitely there's been a lot of coverage on this
5782640	5788880	game in the past. Um, but it just kind of goes to show, you know, um, love it or hate it. Uh,
5788880	5794560	what a modern, uh, you know, contemporary, uh, classic, especially out of the indie scene,
5794560	5802400	it is for sure. Well, even on top of that, as far as, um, it itself being a classic,
5802400	5808480	it draws from classics. And like I said, not just in gaming, but in the music direction,
5808480	5816880	the general art direction of the game. Um, it's, it's a very unique study, especially if you
5816880	5823360	are well versed in music history and, um, and art history. All right. Classic.
5825120	5830960	I'm just saying there was a lot of real intelligence put into this game. Classic
5830960	5836080	game of the week is Fez. I see some other people in chat saying, I should go revisit that game.
5836080	5839520	So, uh, it's always, always fun when the segment can inspire people to go
5840480	5844640	revisit something in the backlog. Don't, don't play into death's demands. No, I,
5844640	5849600	I also still really need to play tunic. That's for sure. So, um, my friend who I played,
5849600	5855120	it takes two with said that's a good game too, but I always, you know, I figured it was a good
5855120	5859760	game. All right. We still have just a few more stories for you and then believe it or not,
5859760	5863840	we're going to go right into calls. We didn't have quite as many stories slotted for tonight,
5863840	5868800	just because, uh, it's been a little bit of a lighter week. Honestly, uh, I guess people are
5868800	5874640	too busy playing Zelda or probably more realistically, uh, with summer game Fest on
5874640	5880160	the horizon, there just isn't quite as much news coming out, uh, because people are sitting on it
5880160	5885600	for, uh, you know, whether it be the official summer game Fest event or something else timed
5885600	5891280	around that event, uh, with there being no E3 this year, uh, we probably get to be seen a lot
5891280	5896160	more headlines, um, a little closer to that. So it's probably going to be slow for a couple of
5896160	5900400	weeks, but we do have some fast headlines. So let's do some rapid fire news. Loki.
5901360	5906160	Yeah. So we have the announcement from game freak that they're going to be working with
5906160	5914800	take two's private, uh, division label to create a brand new IP that is called a codenamed project
5914800	5919600	bloom. It is, uh, they have a pretty cool screenshot from this. I'm not really sure what
5919600	5925520	it's supposed to be, but, um, basically it says, uh, to celebrate this announcement private
5925520	5928960	division and game freak have unveiled the first piece of concept art for the game,
5928960	5935120	which looks like it's like a giant forest and has like some person with either an umbrella or
5935120	5939680	that's a mushroom. I can't really tell. Um, but it's like, it's some sort of action adventure
5939680	5946720	game and it is going to be a new IP. So, uh, we'll have to figure out when that's coming.
5946720	5951520	Not for a while though, because it says the game won't be coming until, uh,
5951520	5961120	2026 fiscal year. So early 2027. Wow. That is very early on. Does this even make the PS5
5961120	5968000	when 2027 be the end of the seven year cycle and the time we start talking about PS6. Yeah. Yeah.
5968000	5973440	So we'll see. I think whatever that is, it'll be neat. Well, I can tell you what it's not,
5973440	5978560	and that would be Pokemon, but for Sony, um, it seems very clear this is going to be going
5978560	5982160	a different direction. And because of that reason, it's like, okay, I got nothing to go off of
5982160	5986080	one piece of arts. Not enough for me to know anything about this. Okay. Game freaks making
5986080	5989840	something for Sony. Cool. Can't wait to see a trailer or something that tells me a little more.
5989840	5996560	And that's, that's, that's all I got on that. Pretty much. It's not much. Um, also we have
5996560	6003760	the announcement that power wash simulator has, um, sold 7 million copies, or I should say have
6003760	6008080	7 million people play it because obviously some of that is going to be game pass and whatnot,
6008640	6013840	but, uh, yeah, very exciting. And I know this year they've, uh, we talked about it weeks ago,
6013840	6020080	but that they've got quite the slate of DLC and stuff coming out for it. So I can't wait to check
6020080	6024160	that out. I dabble in that every once in a while. I need to go back and visit, especially with some
6024160	6028960	of the recent stuff they've put out. So that's a fun game. Yep. All right. Dark soccer. I think
6028960	6037760	you got one headline for us. I do just a little one. Um, there is a new open beta for street
6037760	6046800	fighter six, um, play test for PS five Xbox series and PC, uh, to go from May 19th to the 21st.
6046800	6055520	It will have, um, eight characters, which will be to me, guile Jamie. That isn't me. Um, Judy,
6055520	6063200	uh, Ken, Kimberly, who's so much fun, Luke and you, and a few different stages like, uh, the
6063200	6069760	carrier Byron Taylor, Gamboo temple, Metro city, downtown, the macho ring channel one,
6069760	6076080	and, uh, the training room. You can customize your avatars and the battle hub. Um, there's
6076080	6084560	cross-play commentary, um, all kinds of stuff. So, uh, definitely something worth checking out
6084560	6088320	if you can. Yeah. I'll have to check that out. I mean, I played the last beta, but it was,
6088320	6092000	but not enough. I need to play more of it. Speaking of open betas, you know what had
6092000	6097680	a beta this weekend was Diablo four. I didn't play it. I I'm shocked at myself, but I was busy.
6097680	6104080	I had IRL stuff and I thought for sure I would have until Monday noon when they would pull the
6104080	6108800	plug, but no, they pulled it today. They called it a weekend and then ended it at noon on a Sunday.
6108800	6116320	Silly. So also for Tekken eight, they released the Hwa Rong, uh, trailer. Oh, really? Uh,
6116320	6123680	he used to be like my guy. All right. Well, let's go over to Sony and talk a little bit about
6123680	6128640	PlayStation plus, uh, specifically what is coming to the game catalog. If you're an extra or a
6128640	6134880	premium subscriber, uh, as well as what is getting added to the classics catalog. Uh, so some new
6134880	6139120	games are showing up in the game catalog. There's probably a few too many for me to read, but I'll
6139120	6144080	just mention some of the highlights. We have Conan exiles, uh, dishonored death of the outsider and
6144080	6149520	dishonored to the evil within two humanity, which is a new release. So that's going to be there as
6149520	6154880	well. Uh, ratchet and clank rift apart. Also a newer one from the PlayStation five rise of the
6154960	6162000	Tomb Raider 20 year celebration, uh, is coming as well. Sakuna of rice of ruin. Um, let's see,
6162000	6167120	we have, uh, some of the Tomb Raider games, the more recent ones are coming as well. Watchdogs
6167120	6174240	Legion in the classics catalog for the PSP. We have blade dancer, lineage of light pursuit force
6174240	6180560	siphon filter, Logan shadow, and PlayStation four Ghostbusters, the video game remastered.
6181120	6187440	So, um, I was hoping we'd see more like pick up the pace y'all on those classics. I don't know
6187440	6191520	what's taken a while for some of them to get. I mean, I guess because they put trophies in them
6191520	6196000	and they try to really make them full featured releases, but, uh, really would be hoping to see
6196000	6201760	more, uh, come into that, but it is, you know, they're trying to beef up what's in that collection
6201760	6206160	to begin with. So can't complain about that. All right. Let's travel around the world and check
6206160	6210640	out some new games coming out this week, uh, on the various platforms in the various countries.
6210640	6219280	So let's start with the U S Loki. Not a lot. Um, so we've got, let's see humanity on PC PlayStation
6219280	6226080	four and PlayStation five. That's that new enhanced game, uh, Trinity trigger on PC,
6226080	6233520	Nintendo switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five war Lander on PlayStation five and Xbox series.
6234080	6239280	And last but not least Lego two K drive on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four,
6239280	6244800	PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. All right. Uh, heading over to Japan. It's
6244800	6248880	been a slow couple of weeks. We had golden week happened a little bit ago and it's been kind of
6248880	6253520	slow on the game releases ever since this week. Isn't too much different, but we do have a few,
6253520	6258960	we have a few games this time. So on the Nintendo switch, we have Wanda fortune R is coming out in
6258960	6263120	a regular and special edition from idea factory. And that's really the only big release on the
6263120	6268560	switch this week. However, over on the PlayStation five, we have a couple of titles dread out to it
6268560	6274080	comes out this week, as well as transport fever to, uh, both on the PlayStation five this week,
6274080	6280400	uh, Lego two K drive also we'll get a Japanese release the same day, the U S gets one. And those
6280400	6286880	are your releases in Japan this week, dark Sakura. How about Europe on the 16th for PlayStation and
6286880	6294160	switch. We have Trinity trigger. Um, also on the 16th bus simulator, 21 next stop gold edition.
6294720	6300880	Um, that's for PlayStation and Xbox. Um, the rest of these are on the 19th for PlayStation shadow
6300880	6308960	warrior three definitive edition. Um, on switch toy soldiers, um, on PlayStation and switch, we
6308960	6315200	have a garden simulator. That's got a gnome. And then on the three, we have Lego two cage
6315200	6325920	wrap. That's it. All right. Uh, that is it for the stories and segments we had slotted outside of
6325920	6331040	the classic listener round table. Uh, if you would like to give us a call, of course you sure can.
6331040	6335680	You can join over at vog at network.com slash discord. You can join our green room. We'll take
6335680	6339840	a couple of calls tonight, but I actually think we have a couple of emails. Uh, you can email us
6339840	6344400	every week, participate at orange laundry.com. If you would like to send us some emails and dark
6344400	6350080	soccer is going to jump in the mail bag and hopefully, um, not find herself drowning in here.
6351440	6358720	All right. I'll start with the first one from, uh, Mishi. Um, hi all it's your girl Mishi here
6358720	6363760	back with another gaming week. This week's games consisted of Nintendo switch games, mostly two
6363760	6368560	games in particular. I just had a slow gaming week as I've been under the weather. Any,
6369360	6374960	anyway, said games are as follows. No place like home in this game, you play a girl whose father
6374960	6379840	went to space to do a mission. The game doesn't really say just as he's not home right now.
6379840	6386000	So she sees on earth to take care of his farm. Since the world got taken over by garbage,
6386000	6389680	his farm got wrecked. So she stayed behind to rebuild it and clean up the mess.
6389680	6393360	You have to farm while creating buildings for the farm out of the trash you find
6393920	6399200	sort of like recycling. If you will, you also get to befriend animals and cook. It's really a fun,
6399200	6404880	cozy type of game. The next game I'm sure you're all too familiar with Legend of Zelda. Here's the
6404880	6410160	kingdom. I got to say Nintendo stepped up their game with this one. I can't really say why because
6410160	6414960	I don't want to spoil it for anyone wanting to play, but I will say I'm finding it harder than
6414960	6420160	Breath of the Wild, yet still a lot more fun. I say everyone should check out these games.
6420720	6426640	Everyone should check these games out at least once. Have a great day and stay safe, everyone.
6426640	6431600	Peace, love, and game on. Sincerely, Mishi. Thanks, Mishi, and I hope you feel better.
6432800	6438560	Yeah. All right. Next email. It says quick question, but knowing who sent it,
6438560	6442000	I'm going to refrain. I think it actually is pretty quick,
6442880	6447200	especially comparatively. Good job. Good job.
6448640	6455600	Hello, L.R. Hi, Y.Y.R. Just a quick question this time, actually. I've only been playing
6455600	6460640	Pokemon Go since November, so I was seeking an answer to this question from the folks either
6460640	6465120	hosting or listening to this show who have been playing for far longer than I have.
6465760	6471360	At the present, Niantic is running an in-game event where all candy for catching Pokemon
6471360	6475600	has been doubled for an entire week. This stacks with pineapple berries as well.
6476880	6483120	I've seen them double catch candy before, but only for one or two featured hours,
6483120	6488080	certainly not for the whole week. So my question is, have they actually done this before?
6488080	6495040	Do they do this with any sort of regularity or is this some sort of sign of desperation or perhaps
6495600	6499360	just another non-answer to recent community concerns?
6500080	6504160	Thanks as always for this show and have a great week, Aaron Y.Y.R.
6504160	6509120	Yeah, not the answer I think you were digging for, but it has been seen in game before and I
6509120	6514320	can tell you the time that you can regularly expect it is Halloween because, get it, candy.
6515200	6516800	Mike says it's a regular thing.
6516800	6522720	Yeah. Our Pokemon Go experts in chat kind of agree with what I'm saying is that you can pretty
6522720	6530720	reliably see this in game for multiple days. You also pointed out that they do it hours at a time,
6530720	6536400	fairly regularly too, like community days. You want to read what's going on because
6536400	6541840	usually they either boost candy, they boost Stardust, they boost XP, usually something
6541840	6547760	like that gets boosted. And then same thing with spotlight hour. You can almost reliably
6547760	6552640	count on once a month, there will be at least one hour you can get double candy.
6552640	6555600	And I know that sounds like a lot to kind of hold out for, but
6556400	6563120	never recycle a legendary unless it's dire inventory space or something.
6563120	6568160	Never recycle a legendary outside of one of these double candy drops. But if you're, you know,
6568160	6572880	if you're bursting at the seams, not that people have as many legendaries anymore anyway,
6572880	6580640	because most people stopped rating. But if you can never shred the legendaries until one of
6580640	6586560	these spotlight hours at least, but you can, you can expect it around Halloween. I think Easter
6586560	6592720	had it this last year too. So, you know, just, just think of things where it's cute to work in
6592720	6599360	candy as a bonus. And usually you're going to see it there. SJ100Matt says, if they're going to do
6599360	6604880	a community day for a Pokemon that needs a lot of candy to evolve, they'll do double catch candy as
6604880	6612480	well. I think Noibat had that because that was a 400 candy Pokemon to evolve. So keep an eye out
6612480	6618240	for that. And sorry, I'm terrible at gifts. YYR, I promise you every time I open the game, I do try
6618240	6623520	to go into it. I haven't been playing as much lately. I've just been feeling a little meh on
6623520	6627920	Pokemon Go. It kind of comes and goes. But I'm sure at some point there'll be something where
6627920	6632080	I'm like, oh, I want to go catch a new thing. I'll go Bluetooth, catch a new Pokemon, a new shiny,
6632080	6637040	I don't know. Maybe I'll play. Actually, I can't do the community day next week because I'm going
6637040	6642160	to be on a work trip. And I think I'll be in a conference when most, the conference is on a
6642160	6648080	Sunday, but I'll be in the conference during most of it. So yeah. So apologies if we're Pokemon Go
6648080	6653280	friends for everybody. I'm terrible at gifts. Conference or Yawn friends?
6655280	6662720	Oh, no. I like my job and the stuff I'm going to sounds interesting. I just, my only bitch is
6662720	6668080	a Sunday. Really? Was it half price? It is weird. Fucking weird.
6668080	6673440	Yeah, but whatever. It is what it is. I don't get it. Why did they do that?
6673440	6677040	I don't know. Because the convention center costs less than it does on Friday and Saturday,
6677040	6680880	I'm sure. But I, why not do like a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? I don't know.
6680880	6683520	I don't know. All right. The reason.
6683520	6685040	Yeah. All right.
6687680	6688640	Was that it for emails?
6689920	6690400	Yeah.
6690400	6695040	All right. Well, if you want to send us an email, participate at orangelandtrader.com.
6695040	6699440	Don't let us go too many weeks without an email or I'm going to lecture everyone again. I was
6699440	6704560	kidding. And I was saying this in chat, but I'll say it here too. I kind of feel like the Twitter
6704560	6710160	question worked out pretty well tonight. As much as I have a love hate relationship with Twitter,
6710880	6715120	for the sake of content and interacting with listeners, I'll try to do that a little more
6715120	6722080	often, at least until Blue Sky is open invite for all. And assuming that website keeps its legs and
6722080	6723840	doesn't become another- Are you on there yet?
6723840	6725360	I am. We follow each other.
6726160	6730320	We do? Okay. Because all these weird people follow me and I'm like, I have no idea who
6730320	6730880	these people are.
6730880	6734320	There are people, because it's a new social platform, there's people that will follow
6734320	6741280	literally everybody to try to become like the next big, like one of those people that just
6741840	6745280	leverages their social media clout for money.
6745280	6745840	Reasons.
6745840	6746480	You know, ads and stuff.
6746480	6748080	Well, it's not like I'm following them back.
6748080	6753360	No, I don't follow them back. If you have more than 10,000 followers already on a closed platform,
6753360	6759520	or excuse me, if you're following more than 10,000 people on a closed platform like Blue Sky so far,
6759520	6761120	I'm not following you back.
6761120	6767360	If you have 100, less than that, which most people do, then yes, and you say something in
6767360	6772960	your profile that's like, I'm a gamer. I'm LGBT. Yes, I'll probably follow you back because it
6772960	6774400	seems like we might have something in common.
6776320	6782480	Found a Tia Marie, and I thought it was our Tia because I've never seen anyone else post
6782480	6783280	their name like that.
6783280	6785040	Oh, you got me excited for a minute.
6785040	6787200	And it's not Tia, but they're really cool.
6787920	6788720	Okay, well, that's good.
6789200	6794480	Yeah, if you are on Blue Sky, I'm there at Rob Roberts, and Dark Sakura is there too.
6794480	6795840	You're just Dark Sakura on there, right?
6796640	6796880	Yeah.
6796880	6797120	Yeah.
6798160	6803840	My profile shows as DarkSakura underscore OLR to match back to my thing, but yeah,
6803840	6807680	it's just DarkSakura with whatever the extension is.
6807680	6808320	Yeah, fair.
6809040	6810960	Yeah, on the default Blue Sky server.
6810960	6813440	I will say if you're waiting to get in there, here's the thing.
6814000	6818160	They give us one invite every two weeks.
6819520	6820960	One invite every two weeks.
6820960	6823760	So once you've been on the platform for two weeks, Jamie, they'll send you an invite.
6823760	6828320	I finally got my first one, and I'm sorry if I didn't send it to you, but I sent it
6828320	6832800	to the person who asked me for it first, who said that they would use it.
6833520	6836400	I got mine from another streamer friend.
6836400	6838720	I got mine from the same person.
6839920	6844640	I don't know how they got bulk invites, but yes, that person invited both you and I.
6845600	6846560	So I love it.
6846560	6851200	Yeah, I think I thought he said he sent it to you too.
6851760	6853600	So did it make you squee?
6854720	6857120	I was like, what's this Blue Sky thing?
6857120	6857360	Okay.
6858240	6860880	I was like, what is this thing and why do I want to join?
6860880	6861680	Okay, I joined.
6861680	6867440	Well, and the awesome thing, though, about being on an M1 Mac is that I can run the iOS
6867440	6870880	app on my Mac, and it's pretty cool.
6870880	6872960	And Mike Def says, I'll get it when I get it, I guess.
6873040	6879360	And here's the thing, don't let the exclusiveness of it make you feel like you're totally missing
6879360	6879860	out.
6880720	6883360	There are still a lot of parts that's rough around the edges.
6883360	6887360	Trust me, it's a good thing the floodgates aren't open yet, because there's a lot of
6887360	6890560	things as a newer network, it's got to figure out.
6890560	6894400	And there's a lot, especially when it comes to how are they going to do policy police
6894400	6899120	some things, some concerns came to light with the terms of service, because it's very boiler
6899120	6899680	plate.
6899680	6906560	But the CEO, who is not Jack, by the way, Jack did start it and I believe is on the
6906560	6910800	board because he actually started it when he was at Twitter to do something more decentralized,
6910800	6912000	but he is not the CEO.
6913120	6916080	She's Jay, I think her name is.
6916720	6918640	And I think it is Jay.
6918640	6923600	And she's talked about very openly some of the things that's like, yes, we know this
6923600	6924000	is bad.
6924000	6925200	We're working on it.
6925200	6926960	Please give us a little time.
6926960	6930240	And that's why they're not opening up the floodgates to the platform yet as much as
6930240	6931840	people are ready for it.
6931840	6933760	So I get it.
6934400	6936160	So all right.
6936160	6941200	But, you know, an invite, if I have an invite, I'll pass it to you.
6941200	6941520	Yeah.
6941520	6947920	An invite every two weeks sounds slow, but like, give it three months and then like,
6947920	6953040	because in two weeks I'll have an invite and the person I invited will have an invite.
6953120	6957200	And then in two more weeks, I'll have another, they'll have another, the people we invited.
6957200	6959120	So it'll get around soon enough.
6959120	6962880	Just, you know, you just have to be patient, but give that time to Blue Sky to work out
6962880	6963760	the kinks.
6963760	6969600	There's some very basic things, too, that, like, you can't turn off whatever retweets
6969600	6973280	or I refuse it to call it the thing that they're trying to force us to call it, reblogs or
6973280	6973600	whatever.
6974400	6978080	You can't turn those reblogs off on that platform.
6979040	6984000	So that I really need in order to be able to follow certain people, because some people
6985040	6988640	do it too much and I never see original content and I see it too much.
6989840	6993040	And I also really need them, too.
6993040	6998160	When you refresh your feed, it needs to start from where you left off, not at the top.
6998160	6999840	That is the most annoying thing to me.
7001520	7002400	But they'll get there.
7002400	7002880	They're new.
7002880	7003440	They'll get there.
7003440	7004240	They're in beta.
7004240	7005200	It's not a complaint.
7005200	7006640	It's just a loud suggestion.
7006640	7007120	That's all.
7007840	7008240	Okay.
7008240	7010160	It looks like I don't have an extra yet.
7010720	7011280	Not yet.
7011280	7013840	But you only came in a couple days behind me, right?
7015200	7016480	You should have one real soon.
7018160	7018800	Yeah.
7018800	7019600	All right.
7019600	7024320	Anyway, that's it, because it was a shorter week and we don't have any calls in the green
7024320	7024960	room.
7024960	7026960	We're ready to wrap it all up for the night.
7026960	7030240	So we're going to go around and get some final thoughts.
7030240	7035840	DarkSakura, I know you are off to do some Dessert by Deadlight streaming.
7036720	7038160	Do you have any final thoughts?
7041440	7041840	Oh, wait.
7041840	7042720	I need to give the usual.
7042720	7042960	Sorry.
7042960	7044320	I forgot the boilerplate.
7044320	7047120	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two
7047120	7047760	about the show.
7047760	7050880	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
7050880	7052960	want more voices here to put out on air.
7052960	7058320	Please tell a friend and also a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify,
7058320	7061200	or wherever you found this show goes an awful long way.
7061200	7064480	That all being said, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
7066560	7070960	I want someone to buy stickers so I can hit my goal for this month.
7072080	7072480	Please.
7072480	7073120	Sticker.
7073120	7074160	I have stickers.
7076480	7079680	And also, I might try to get another adapt.
7079680	7080240	Who knows?
7080240	7082880	And pray for me because tomorrow I start ballet for real.
7084080	7084640	Oh, fun.
7084640	7084960	Good luck.
7084960	7087680	Let's sacrifice the chicken and light some candles or something.
7087680	7090160	And then we'll have some chicken salad by candlelight.
7090160	7092160	I will have a chicken salad for dinner just for you.
7093840	7094480	All right.
7094480	7095280	Later, taters.
7095280	7095840	All right.
7095840	7096640	Bye, DarkSakura.
7097200	7098640	All right, Loki, we're going to go to you.
7098640	7099840	Your final thought for us tonight?
7100800	7106960	My final thought is that, well, one, I was going to show off this cool shirt that I have.
7106960	7110160	I don't know if you can see it, but it's for Master Boot Record.
7110160	7112480	So it's all like ASCII art.
7112480	7113440	Oh, OK.
7113440	7114000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7114640	7117760	Because, you know, Master Boot Record, they make music with floppy drives.
7117760	7118560	So that's awesome.
7120480	7124000	And then let's see what else.
7124560	7127280	Unrelated, my neighbor's cat.
7127280	7129120	I finally saw her after six months.
7130080	7130720	She came back.
7130720	7133760	I thought she was dead because I haven't seen her in so long.
7133760	7135360	So she came back for pets.
7135360	7135760	Let's go.
7135760	7138560	She always knocks on the door, which is funny.
7138560	7140560	The neighbor's cat knocks on the door?
7140560	7142080	Well, she doesn't knock on the door.
7142080	7144000	She meows at the door usually.
7144000	7147600	She'll meow at the door with the door open when the weather's nice.
7147600	7150000	And she'll want me to come outside to give her pets.
7150000	7153680	And she'll actually lay in my lap and let me give her pets and stuff like that.
7153840	7154400	Which is funny.
7155440	7156160	So there's all that.
7156160	7158480	So those are the random updates that you get.
7158480	7159840	Those are my final thoughts.
7159840	7160240	All right.
7161280	7166880	My final thought is we will be streaming some Stranger of Paradise tomorrow and some
7166880	7168640	theater them on Wednesday.
7168640	7170560	And then I'm going to be gone over the weekend.
7170560	7173680	I'm going to be gone for a bit because this conference is long.
7173680	7176560	So I'm going to be gone Saturday through Thursday.
7176560	7179200	So sadly, my streams next week kind of suffer a little bit.
7179200	7180640	But that's you know, it is what it is.
7180640	7183760	I look forward to the stuff for my day job.
7183760	7184800	It'll be a good conference.
7185760	7191280	But yeah, so we will see you in two weeks here at Orange Launch Radio.
7191280	7194160	There will be no show next week, but I hope you all have a great week.
7194720	7199680	We will be back, which I believe is Memorial Day weekend and the start of Summer Games
7199680	7200160	Done Quick.
7200160	7204160	So it's going to be a busy week in two weeks and probably a bit of news as we start.
7204160	7209200	Because two weeks after that, Summer Game Fest has happened and the Microsoft event
7209200	7209840	will be happening.
7210400	7214320	We're four weeks away from a firehose of news in the gaming industry.
7214320	7215840	It's going to be an exciting year.
7215840	7217920	Diablo IV is going to be out soon.
7217920	7220240	Final Fantasy XVI, not long after that.
7220240	7221600	Street Fighter VI.
7221600	7223760	And y'all are eating up Zelda right now.
7223760	7229840	It is a good year to be a gamer and we will continue this year of the gamer in two weeks
7229840	7231120	here at Orange Launch Radio.
7231120	7232720	I hope you all have a wonderful week.
7232720	7234160	We'll see you next time.
7234160	7234880	Good night.
7264160	7273520	See you next week.
