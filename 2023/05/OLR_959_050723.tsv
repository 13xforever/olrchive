0	14800	Another $70 flagship launch, another critical whiff in terms of bugs, polish and consistency.
14800	19960	Will Redfall become a No Man's Sky or a Cyberpunk 2077? Ask me again in 5 years. Every flagship
19960	23780	title must be a critical hit in order to preserve money, yet cult classic Final Fantasies have
23780	27760	now been allowed in numerous remasters. Which one is more valuable?
27760	30800	This is your knot. Everything is up for an update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob
30800	33680	Roberts, Jamie Sommerson, Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the
33680	36920	week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
36920	45520	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
45520	52720	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode
52720	61040	number 959 of our show for tonight, May the 7th of 2023. I can't believe it. It is May
61040	66760	already. Hi, I'm Rob Roberts here with you every week on Sunday nights with my co-hosts
66760	70840	over there in that little box. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70840	71840	Hi.
71840	74120	Hi, how are you?
74120	76120	Not high enough.
76120	78120	Hashtag mood.
78120	79120	Huh?
79520	80520	I said hashtag mood.
80520	98200	I'm a little on the tired and today was another ballet day for me. I did about almost two
98200	108680	hours of just, oh, let me fix my camera, of just stretching and the actual ballet and
108680	118360	then the recovery stretching and then the massage gun and all of the foam rollers and
118360	125120	everything and the feet soaking in ice buckets and all of that. And I have mad respect for
125120	133560	the pros. I only did this for more like an hour and 45 minutes, but the ones that go
133560	136680	and do this as their job. Oh, hell.
136680	144200	Still, it sounds like it's been a super healthy and fun little, I guess, hobby for you. Lifestyle
144200	145200	edition, maybe.
145200	150040	I have something interesting about it is that, well, I had a doctor's appointment on Friday
150040	154720	to have my back looked at because I had been having some pretty bad back pain before. And
154720	163400	a lot of it has fixed itself with having done ballet. I still have the pains, but that's
163400	168640	from activity now and I'm still getting that cortisone shot in my hip. But I've noticed
168640	175680	that since practicing my turnout, where the feet, that it all comes from the hips, I have
175680	183440	better hip rotation. My back has been better. I watch my posture more often. My flexibility
183440	188760	is getting better. I mean, I'm not anywhere near where I want to be or where I used to
188760	195280	be, but I'm getting there. And it's just something about getting up and doing something and challenging
195280	196280	myself.
196280	199960	Well, it reminds me of the days when this show started, when you, me, and hi in the
199960	205920	other box, Techmaster Loki, hello, hello. When all three of us got together playing
205920	212200	a Dance Dance Revolution. I was never skinnier. Even today, after I've lost all that weight
212200	219200	since 2022, I'm still not as skinny as I was back when we played DDR several times
219200	224040	a week. And I mean several, like three or four times a week playing hours of DDR. I
224040	227400	was never skinnier than that phase.
227400	237400	Right now I'm doing two hours of ballet every week for now. But I'm actually, I want to
237400	242800	bring out the Dreamcast and play a second mix. My dance pads are so slippery because
242800	246320	the two layers of plastic, because I have official Konami pads and they're dated at
246320	251480	this point, which doesn't help. Yeah. And it's funny. I was watching a video too about
251480	256680	like all of the various codes for all of the DDR machines and it was kind of, I put it
256680	259160	up on my Twitter. I was like, anyone remember this?
259160	263480	Well for actually just real quick, let me, let me pivot on that note over to Techmaster
263480	268080	Loki, because Loki, you were tweeting about DDR machine stuff this week. Did you, you
268080	270360	got back on the extreme in your garage this week, right?
270360	275320	Yeah, I did. Cause I had to hook it back up again. So it still works.
275320	277280	That's well, that's good. It still works.
277280	281840	Yeah. It's go fake, you know, like arcade hardware from the nineties versus computer
281840	290760	from the 2010s, 2020. I think it was like nine, not long ago, like late 2010s, you know,
290760	296680	arcade hardware still fine. Computer's like, no, I can't take, I can't take the weather.
296680	299080	So well,
299080	303640	I'm glad everything still works. How was playing after so long?
303640	310000	I mean, it's, you know, you have to keep just dialing back to, you know, as easy as you
310000	314880	can because it's like your mind, you're like, Oh yeah, I could do that. And then your body's
314880	321360	like, no, you can't. So, I mean, it's obviously, you know, I used to play like pretty high
321360	325880	end, like doubles and stuff. So now it's just, I mean, this is what it was like too. I remember
325880	331200	like coming back into it, like from a long time when I first got the machine, it was,
331200	338620	you know, starting off singles and doing, you know, I think it was like five to six
338620	346460	footer songs. I think now I'm doing, yeah, like four to six. And it's, I was doing the non-stop
346460	350620	site. I tend to do a pop four all the time. Cause it's kind of like middle of the road,
350620	356860	like pretty easy stuff just to get your stamina back up. And because it is a lot when you're,
356860	362060	you haven't done it a while. It's not, I mean, for one, yeah, it's stamina, like very tired
362060	368220	too. Your muscles will like hurt a lot, obviously from not doing it for a while. So it's just
369580	374940	getting used to it again. So it just has to, I have to keep doing it regularly and they'll,
374940	379980	he'll come back somewhat. Yeah, that's definitely the regularity is definitely the key.
381340	386620	I also want to say hello to our folks in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at
386620	390140	six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,
390140	395980	even though he wasn't here tonight, he was on a personal trip. But we do tape live on Sunday
395980	401500	nights at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash V O G network. Bobby will be back next week.
401500	406220	He starts an hour before we do, and we will be here next week. We will not be here live in
406220	411180	two weeks. It's not a holiday or anything. It's just a very random day job conflict for me.
411180	415740	So ironically, I believe Bobby had a day job conflict thing today. That's why he wasn't
415740	418620	live and I have one in two weeks. It just, that's the way it goes sometimes.
419340	425660	Also, I may not be here next week because of a Golden State Pinball festival.
425660	426060	Oh.
426060	427980	So this is the only day I can attend.
427980	433020	Oh, dang. I kind of want to check that out to be honest. Where's, is that in Lodi?
434620	438780	Because they had a big Comic-Con there today. I went to the same place. Yeah, they did.
438780	440540	It's Lodi. I don't pay attention much.
440540	441740	Yeah. One of the voice actors.
441740	442700	Sorry Lodi people.
442700	446460	No, one of the voice actors I met at Dragon Con was supposed to be a guest there.
447020	452620	And I noticed on Twitter had to cancel out just, he had, he had an unfortunate situation in his
452620	457260	family. So yeah, he had to back out, but I saw, I was like, Oh, Lodi. I was like, Oh,
457260	461420	which for those that don't know, which I assume would be most people outside this general area,
461420	467180	it's like, it's a suburb of SAC, but kind of, it's like 45 minutes South maybe. That might be
467180	470220	actually be a little, it depends what part of town you're coming from. Yeah.
470300	476220	It's like maybe a 25 to 30 minute drive for me from where I am.
476220	477340	Yeah. Yeah.
477900	483500	So it's not bad. And the venue is actually, you know, pretty good for what it is.
485660	491340	But I mean, last year they had Weird Al, which I would assume they're going to have it again
491340	494620	this year. Our Weird Al should be arriving before too long.
494620	495180	That's awesome.
496140	502620	But, but yeah. But there's a few other tables that I'm really interested in looking at and
502620	507180	I couldn't, I mean, there's a chance I might be able to do some on Saturday.
508380	515500	And if you want to go together, Rob, we can, I can try to get the half day and see if we can go.
516220	520220	I actually have tentative plans on Saturday. So ironically, Sunday would be the only day I could
520220	525580	go to. So we'll have to see. I would just have to leave early. So we'll see. We'll see.
526860	530940	All right. But anyhow, let's get into the show tonight. Actually, one other quick note,
530940	535580	I do want to point out from chat because I have been reading chat. And by the way, I just,
535580	539180	we had a hype train going and you all have been very generous with your bits and subs.
539180	543260	So I just want to, you know, usually, you know, we don't read those live. Like most Twitch streamers
543260	546620	will stop what they're doing and acknowledge that. But since we are taping a podcast,
546620	551420	which of course you can download on iTunes, Spotify, all the places that you find podcasts,
552220	557020	we don't usually stop for all those. But you know, when you all go above and beyond especially and
557020	560220	do the hype trains and all that, I have to say something. So thank you for your generosity.
560220	564540	I really appreciate that. But several people in chat noting that Loki behind you tonight,
565100	573100	you have streaming some gameplay of Revolution X, the classic Aerosmith shooty bang, bang gallery
573100	578540	game. Why Revolution X tonight? Is this because of their farewell tour that the tickets are going
578540	584620	on sale or whatever? Oh yeah, I forgot about that. No, it's not about that. No, it's more of,
584620	588460	I didn't know what I wanted to put behind me. And because I went to the Hard Rock
588460	596540	casino last night to go see Ali Wong, I just thought, you know, music and yeah, it just kind of.
597820	601660	No, that works. I haven't been out there at all. How is that venue? Is it nice out there?
602140	607820	It's nice. I mean, it looks new for sure. I mean, I got tagged in a TikTok or something
607820	612460	because they're doing an ABBA dance party up there. And I was like, oh, maybe. Yeah,
612460	618380	they have something. They have something Drag Race related. Oh, the official Work the World Tour is
618380	624060	going there. Yeah. Yeah. And like some Diana Ross thing as well. So like they kept like showing that
624060	628780	like on the screens advertising the different venues they're coming. I'm tempted. Dark
628780	632940	Sakurai. You want to go see? I don't even know who's on that tour, but I imagine it's all the
632940	639340	queens. If Sasha Kolbe is on it, I mean, I'll go see mom. I haven't watched the last couple of
639340	645260	seasons, so I might be behind a little bit. I might catch up. I rarely watch it anymore,
645260	650140	but you know, you just, you see the clips are hard to dodge on social media, you know,
650140	656380	of all the big moments. So. Especially with our crowd. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's get into news
656380	659660	and what's going on in the gaming world. We're going to start off with this. Loki,
659660	662380	I don't know if you want to talk about this. I have it up if you don't though.
662380	668060	Yeah, I can talk about it. So it's more of Nintendo being Nintendo. So
669340	676300	you may remember that not that long ago, like a week or two, there was a whole thing about Bowser
676300	684060	and getting arrested for, you know, the whole creating mod chips and stuff for the Wii and
684060	689100	all that. Not done Bowser, but another guy named Bowser. The third Bowser.
690780	697660	Not the king of the Koopas. Bowser had seven kids, so let's not forget.
698220	704060	All the Koopalings are getting in different lines of business. Yeah. So this one is in regards to
704060	711020	the data DMCA takedown requests to GitHub to remove a piece of software called Lockpick,
711020	718620	which is a tool for dumping your system keys from your own switch. The reason that people are upset
718620	724940	about this because this does not actually prevent piracy that's been most prevalent with the switch,
724940	730140	which is emulation because emulators don't need these keys in order to play games on it.
731500	736940	And it's weird, though, that they're like even coming after this because this doesn't necessarily
736940	740860	enable piracy either. It's just like it's a tool to do something.
742620	747340	They want complete control, though. Yeah. I mean, Nintendo can't be happy. I mean,
747340	751980	and I know you have a coupling story with this, but I think a lot of people that follow gaming
751980	758060	know. Well, I think everybody that follows gaming knows that this Friday is a very big day in the
758060	763100	Zelda universe. Obviously, the long wait for the sequel to Breath of the Wild is over. And Friday,
763100	770620	Tears of the Kingdom comes out. And I bet there's multiple people in chat who have the day off work
770620	775980	on Friday in acknowledgment of what's going on. And the reason why I bring that up is that
775980	782460	obviously it's a huge target for piracy and no secret that it's already out there. So,
782460	787580	you know, folks know to kind of watch out for spoilers on social media, careful with hashtags
787580	794860	because people are, you know, dodging that stuff. DJRomaS in chat says, not me. I could care less
794860	803100	about Zelda. Well, let me give a nice hearty, ooh, she's different to that. Yeah. I mean, like,
803100	808460	no, no. I mean, real quick, though, real quick, though, I, I'm not going to pick that up. Here's
808460	812540	the thing. Here's the thing. I'm not going to pick it up right away either because there's just,
812540	818220	there's so much coming out right now that I'm like really interested in, uh, that, you know,
818220	823900	I'll get to Zelda probably later this year. So I understand, I understand it isn't for everyone
823900	831420	day one, but I also recognize this is like the series for some people. There are some people
831420	836620	out there that don't care about most video games, but they care about Zelda, you know? So this is a
836620	842220	big day for some folks. I get it. This would be like when Return of the Jedi came out in theaters.
842540	849180	Yeah. For some. Yeah, for sure. But the thing is, is that, you know, Dan,
849180	853660	I don't think is playing, I just got him Osmond. Um, but other than that, there's not really any
853660	859500	major new gaming going on in my house. So it's perfect for us. You know, this, this,
859500	866220	this Zelda release, this was Abba's voyage album being released. I, so, you know, for, for me and
866220	871420	not everybody gave a shit. I understand. I respect that, you know, even though everybody, most people
871420	876860	would probably say, Abba, yeah, very impactful on pop music, had a huge mark and so forth.
877580	880700	So I could sit here and say the same thing about Zelda. I get it. I completely get it
880700	884860	when people are losing their minds. Just me personally, probably, probably more towards
884860	887900	the end of the year is when I'll get around to it. And we would just tell Abba thank you for
887900	892940	the music. That's right. That's absolutely right. Anyway. Sorry, Loki. I know you're trying to make
892940	897740	a point. No, no, it's fine. Um, no, it's just, I mean, yeah, it's gonna be a good game. I don't
897740	903820	know if it's like earth shattering or anything. I mean, like, yeah, it's a sequel to, you know,
903820	911100	breath of the wild. I watched Celtic play some of it, um, is of course under a partial NDA for,
911100	917500	for some of it, but it looks really, really amazing. I mean, just the innovations that
917500	922940	they've made for the system and everything and brought back a few things that had been in, uh,
923500	927740	intended for the first release, they're able to do in this one and the world building.
928540	936540	I have to say, I like the big thing about certain games for me is the immersive factor, you know,
936540	943340	the, like the culture that was created inside this little universe, you know, it has a language,
943340	949580	it has customs. You can follow the people around as they do stuff in their day, you know, and
949660	955180	that's the kind of thing that I enjoy to see as I like learning more about a universe,
955180	960300	about seeing its lore, you know? And I mean, which is part of the reason why I think I'm so
960300	967740	big into Dead by Daylight, but, um, but that's, that's really the core of it for me is I'm,
967740	974380	I'm excited for learning more about the universe. Now to generally kind of sum up what I, the
974380	978620	discussion I see having in chat right now is that people seem to be on the same page that like
978620	983100	the people that are breaking street date, you know, some people have been so bold as to stream
983100	989580	it, which is a, you know, unless you are an authorized, because I believe they allowed
989580	993660	press embargo to stream like an hour or two on a certain date. And I think that's what Dark
993660	997660	Soccer is referring to too. That's, that's different, but the people that don't have that
997660	1003260	and are going beyond, you know, and so forth, uh, just trying to get, you know, internet points,
1003260	1007420	cool points or something like, obviously people are just irritated with all that and putting out
1007420	1014220	the spoilers. I think that they're allowing controlled exploration of certain areas.
1015020	1019820	Probably. Yeah. And sometimes that's what companies will do is say, you may stream
1020540	1025660	this area up to this point. Like sometimes it gets very specific. I know back when we used to get
1025660	1030780	that kind of stuff, we would get that sometimes. They were letting Zeltik play ahead and it's,
1030780	1036940	he's got a pretty long video about it, but there were certain things that he could show,
1036940	1041660	but not talk about. Like it could be on the screen, but he wasn't allowed to call it out
1041660	1047340	or certain things that could not be expressly talked about like certain game elements or
1047340	1052380	different lore in the game. Cause it needed, and this is the whole thing that a company
1053180	1061420	makes its impact by surprise. You know, the whole surprise and delight your, your customers thing.
1062300	1070460	That's, I think Nintendo has been really good about, at least as far as what their,
1070460	1074700	their products are concerned is that the moment that it comes out, it builds all this mystery
1074700	1078700	around it. You have people leaking this stuff and there goes the mystery. They're not going
1078700	1083100	to be so surprised, you know, where the person who doesn't know what they're going to get,
1083660	1088140	but they have a reputation to go on. They're the ones who are going to be going out and
1088140	1094620	buying it site and see unreviewed, you know, because it's something that they have particular
1094620	1102700	trust in that brand and they want to be surprised. And I don't fault Nintendo for,
1102700	1109820	for going all out on this one, you know, for really, really, you know, hammering down those,
1109820	1116700	those leaks in the rumors because their whole bread and butter for a lot of their games is
1116700	1119900	how much is it going to surprise and delight their audience?
1120620	1124940	Well, speaking of bringing the hammer down, Loki, I think there's a second part of this too. And I
1124940	1130700	saw it got brought up in chat too. Not even really like bringing a hammer down, just Reggie Fils-Aime
1130700	1137660	memeing on stuff. So yeah, someone posted a screenshot of like, look, I see I'm playing
1137660	1142300	Tears of a Kingdom on an emulator. And then of course he quoted Liam Neeson's, you know,
1142300	1148380	Taken line, you know, I have a particular set of skills. I mean, yeah, it's cool, but like, okay,
1148380	1153340	cool. But like, it's also one of those things where it's like, you know, you're fucking around
1153340	1158780	and you about to find out. Like it's, it's one of those, like you, you knew what you were doing. So
1160380	1163820	There is one thing you don't fuck with and that's that man's forehead.
1164860	1170460	Or that man, period. Like you don't fuck with Reggie Fils-Aime period, end of sentence.
1170460	1177980	Like, it's just, so yeah. Yeah. Mike Defton chat says that kid found out the hard way. Yes.
1177980	1182540	Well, you know, speaking, okay, to kind of circle it back a little bit to the GitHub conversation
1182540	1187260	and on the one hand, yes, I understand why Nintendo is being a little bit hypersensitive
1187260	1193740	about emulators because, you know, it's not a great feeling to see this game break street
1193740	1199580	date by at least a week and a half, if not more, with the people that are playing it and so forth.
1199580	1204780	So I understand Nintendo is kind of doing a broad swipe. However, as you pointed out, you know,
1204780	1210860	this, this particular component of getting your key does not in itself lend to piracy. And I think
1210860	1215820	you said there, the emulators don't even require it. So they don't require it. And so like,
1215820	1221340	that's the thing is like, that's if you want to play like using like your own system type of thing.
1221340	1228140	But which still a matter of control though, it is. But I also kind of feel like the consumer,
1228140	1233180	and this has been settled in a court of law is that the consumers do have the entitlement to
1233180	1239180	make one backup copy for their purposes. It's just obviously you can't put that backup copy on
1239740	1244140	torrent sites and say, Oh, whoops, sorry about that. You're entitled to make a backup copy for
1244140	1251820	yourself. And to be fair to the folks that are doing this, the switch is dating technology.
1251820	1257100	We all know that that's no secret. I think most people kind of accept that Tears of the Kingdom
1257100	1262540	is probably going to push this thing about as far as it can go, because it already seems like
1262540	1267020	it's been crying under the pressures of Pokemon, Scarlet Violet, and some of the other recent
1267020	1273100	releases. So I, I kind of understand why someone might be like, and as long as they can do it in
1273100	1277820	their own bubble, I'm not talking about streaming it. I'm not talking about putting it out on the
1277820	1283340	internet. I'm talking about in their own bubble with their own tools on, on get access to,
1283420	1287420	on get up, taking a copy of their game, playing it on PC and playing it with,
1288060	1295820	you know, the upped, uh, either graphics or just the speed at which piece modern PCs can process
1295820	1300460	as opposed to a switch. That's the thing too, is that you may run into a situation where you have
1300460	1306460	a better experience playing emulated than you would on the, that's it. That's it. Because the
1307020	1314300	good game, even though it's a $70 game, by the way, $70 game, and you know how great of a tracker
1314300	1323340	we have at $70 games so far, you know, even if it is a big AAA publisher, like I know it's Nintendo,
1323340	1329900	but I'm very skeptical that it's going to run smoothly.
1329900	1338380	Here's the thing, ability to run as smooth as a PlayStation 5 or Xbox series game aside,
1338380	1347820	that part aside, I do feel like if anybody is justified with that type of price for a day one
1347820	1355660	release, hold on, it's probably Nintendo in this game. Reason being Nintendo games far more than
1355660	1361420	their competitors lack those type of day one breaking bugs that you hear about in the games
1361420	1368140	that other release and they tend to be very well-rounded packages out the gate. I'm sure
1368140	1374220	this game will have DLC, but it's not going to feel like certain other games that release where
1374220	1378940	it feels like the DLC is necessary to get the full scope of the game, if that makes sense.
1378940	1384380	So my point being is that I feel like most of the complaints people have about companies releasing
1384380	1391740	$70 games, like Nintendo, for better or for worse, doesn't seem to fall to those same issues.
1392300	1397020	But then again, they've never charged $70 until now. So maybe things are going to change. I don't
1397020	1403500	know. But I do feel like if anybody, Nintendo puts out the better product off the shelf than
1403500	1408940	most of their peers in gaming, especially when you look at what's going on, you know, I know we'll get
1408940	1413180	to it later in the show, but what was going on with Microsoft this week, you know, so.
1414620	1420380	Let's see. Comments in chat. DJ Rama S says, if we were having this conversation like 10 years ago,
1420380	1424380	I wouldn't have cared. I'd bootleg all the games. Fuck your feelings. But when you have friends who
1424380	1428860	work in the industry and you learn more about the inner workings, can't support piracy. Yeah. And I
1428860	1433260	want to make clear, we don't endorse piracy too. And everything I just said there, I'm talking
1433260	1439740	about you with your Switch, your game, your PC. Sure. Maybe using some tools on GitHub,
1439740	1443340	but it's, you're still buying the game. You're still buying everything you need to make it
1443340	1449100	happen. You're just making it happen your own way, which I do feel like you ought to be able to do.
1450060	1458220	So let's see. Other comments in chat. Mike Def does point out they did charge $70 in the 90s.
1458220	1461580	You know, some of those cartridge games. That's why cartridge got to be an expensive format.
1461580	1466620	That is a fair point. Dark Tetsuya says, I know there have been Nintendo games launching with
1466620	1471420	issues, but I feel like it's few and far between. And usually not long before those issues are
1471420	1475660	patched up. Oh yes. I was very, I chose my words very carefully there. And I didn't want to say
1475660	1481100	these games launch with no issues. I wanted to say compared to their peers, they launched with
1481100	1488220	the least amount of issues, I think is the better way to phrase that. So anyway. Loki,
1488220	1491580	any other thoughts on that before we move on to our gaming weeks and all that?
1492300	1499180	No, I just think Nintendo is still like, because emulation is legal. So like, I think
1499180	1504860	attacking emulation, especially with GitHub, because they like GitHub is a smaller company.
1504860	1510460	And Microsoft buy it, ironically? Um, I mean, guess so. But like, I was,
1510460	1515100	I still assume that they're running kind of separately from Microsoft. So they're probably
1515100	1521020	complying with a lot of these DMCA takedown notices without fighting it because, you know,
1521740	1526860	they're not gonna stick their neck out to try to protect something that is been, you know, shown
1526860	1531900	to have precedent to be safe and okay, they're just gonna take it down so they can have their
1531900	1537100	safe harbor status. But also at the same time, I think some of these companies abuse that because
1537100	1540700	they're like, well, what are they gonna do fight us on it, they're not gonna fight us on it,
1540700	1546300	because we'll sue them if they fight us on it. And even if they may be entitled to do that or not.
1546300	1554540	Like, for example, you know, when people are cease and desisting, like, just footed gameplay footage
1554540	1560780	that appears online. Yeah, technically, it's your game and stuff. But like, I don't know, it's I
1560780	1565180	feel like that that shouldn't just because your game leaked out. First off, just because your
1565180	1570140	game leaked out. That's your fault. Honestly, like, it's your fault for staging your deliveries
1570140	1575340	that damn early that it got leaked out. Why are you shipping this product to stores a week in
1575340	1580860	fucking advance? Don't do that then. Because when I used to work at a distributor, like mom and pop
1580860	1585420	stuff, which which they always blame the mom pop shops, but it's always the mass retailers that end
1585420	1590140	up leaking that crap out. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. First off, because the mom pop shops are like,
1590140	1594620	I ain't leaking this stuff out. Like I can hardly get this stuff on time, let alone you know,
1594620	1601420	trying to get that like early, like a week early. Um, so it's big box for sure that to blame for
1601420	1607020	that. I mean, track it down there. Like maybe you should not stage your stuff so damn early than if
1607020	1612540	you're worried about it leaking out. Or like, implement something that you have to unlock it
1612540	1616860	at a certain time. Like I know you do that digitally. But like, and I guess that doesn't
1616860	1622220	necessarily work in, you know, if a console can't connect to the internet, but there's got to be a
1622220	1628940	way that you could do something. Yeah, I wouldn't be easily defeated. But you know, I just, I don't
1628940	1635100	get the blame on people stupid. I don't feel sorry for Nintendo about the the game leaking out early
1635100	1640940	because you I think you illustrated it very well. How that happened. I do feel bad for the fans.
1640940	1646300	Because inevitably human behavior, especially in a lot of pop culture, specifically nerd culture,
1646300	1651900	including the umbrella of gaming, people have this desire to one up other people and prove that
1651900	1656540	they're the coolest kid in town because they got to do said thing first. And sometimes people will
1656540	1662380	do that by putting spoilers out there like, you know, the boat sinks or you know, those these
1662380	1670220	types of big spoilers for games to assert them assert some type of strange dominance over others.
1670220	1674860	And that's that's where I feel bad. But I don't feel bad for Nintendo. I feel bad for the fans.
1675580	1678940	Because people don't know how to behave themselves. That's that's what it is.
1679900	1684700	Um, let's see, actually, I want to mention this real quick too, before we get into gaming weeks,
1684700	1690780	because E3VL asked a very good question that we all kind of run on an assumption on and we
1690780	1696540	probably need to stop assuming that everybody knows things like this. E3VL says, what is GitHub
1696540	1703500	anyway? Great question. GitHub is basically, as I understand it, a repository for code,
1704220	1710060	especially for like people that want to work on something either transparent, transparently,
1710060	1716060	or sort of crowdsource, you know, help with code. Now, obviously, this also means you can
1716060	1721420	put code up there. And you know, everybody can grab it and compile it. Yeah, it's also
1721420	1727900	different applications. It's also for like different. What's the actual terminology for
1727980	1733980	it's, it allows you to basically store snapshots of your code. So for example,
1733980	1738780	if I'm working on a project or something like that, I would send over here's my project or
1738780	1743740	whatever that I've made. And then I make changes to it. And then I send another update to that.
1743740	1750060	And then if something breaks, I can go back to it's basically a version history, store different
1750060	1756140	revisions of your code. Yeah, sure, you can work on it collaboratively as well. But it's basically
1756140	1762300	a repo site that you can just store versions of your code, you can see changes, you can,
1763180	1767660	you know, fork it off. So like, if I wanted, if I was developing something, and someone wanted
1767660	1773980	to take that as a base and develop something else, they could do that. Wikipedia, but for the project
1773980	1781260	you're working on with code, basically, in a way, not really exact, like, I'm trying to, I'm trying
1781260	1786540	to simplify it, though, for everybody, Loki, like, I know, there's, there's nuances. But also,
1787740	1792780	and I kind of want to point out with this, the irony is, sure, Nintendo DMCAs GitHub,
1792780	1797900	and I'm sure they took it down. But part of the reason why people put it up on GitHub in the first
1797900	1802140	place is because now it's on the internet, everybody can literally grab the code and compile
1802140	1808700	their own versions, like, Nintendo did nothing to stop the distribution of this. Because, and
1808700	1814060	honestly, you know, and I love every, I know everybody loves to overuse that Streisand effect
1814060	1819020	comparison. But that's what it is. And that is the whole like, when a company does something like
1819020	1825660	this, they only shine a spotlight on it, because everybody reports on it. And that name comes from
1825660	1831100	when Barbra Streisand tried to stop photos of her house being published, then everybody ran the
1831100	1837020	story with a picture of the house in question. So it's that whole type of thing is that Nintendo
1837020	1842460	probably only brought a spotlight to this tool. And what is because I, I never knew this was a
1842460	1846300	thing. Until here, we are talking about it now. I never knew this was a thing.
1846300	1852620	Yeah. And especially when you consider like, you know, that modding your console is probably going
1852620	1858700	to be more risky than just downloading and playing the games on your PC. Plus, they'll run better.
1858700	1863900	Plus, you can just run them off Steam Deck, which is going to run it just fine. And if there's more
1863900	1870860	powerful Steam Deck type consoles or computers coming out, like, okay, cool. Now I don't need
1870860	1876620	those keys. So what have you really done? You've you've driven people to now figure out, Oh, hey,
1876620	1881820	this is way much easier than the other stuff. I'm just gonna do this instead. Yeah, less people
1881820	1887900	buying. I gotta admit, I'm, I'm legit curious about how a switch game might run on my PC and
1887900	1892620	how all I can bought it. Now I don't, I'm not going to be brazen enough to stream it or do
1892620	1897980	anything. There's just for my own little tee-hees in my own little house. Like I, but now I'm like,
1897980	1904780	wow, it sounds like Nintendo telling all these people to stop has only shown a spotlight on,
1904780	1910220	like, there's all these really cool things modders and people are doing to these games that are,
1910220	1914300	that are making them better in some ways. I mean, I guess it's opinion, but, you know,
1915500	1920620	I'm curious about it more than anything, to be honest. So anyway. All right, let's move on.
1920620	1925180	Let's talk about the things that struck our curiosity in our gaming weeks and the types
1925180	1929260	of games that we have been playing this week. So let me go over to Dark Sakura and ask,
1929260	1935740	how was your gaming week? I, of course, played Dead by Daylight. I started, well,
1935740	1942300	continued on with my second playthrough of Marvel's Midnight Suns. My, my streaming days
1942300	1946300	are going to change because of ballet. So I'm actually going to be starting two streams on
1946300	1949500	Monday and I'm believing one of them is going to be cold to the lamb.
1950620	1956940	Start over and play through the new DLC. I also played world cup soccer for pinball
1957580	1963740	and I played Beatles because I freaking love it. That game is like a total asshole. And then it's
1963740	1968860	a gentleman. It's like the one between it's either really nice to you and it suddenly hates you,
1968860	1974220	or it just hates you the whole time. And then you suddenly have a good ball. Like I got denied my
1974220	1979260	multi ball on my third ball and I was like, excuse me, what? All because I didn't make a ramp.
1981580	1987820	I was like, dang. But, but yeah, and I'm trying to think of something new that I want to,
1988460	1995260	you know, try out. I don't know. I've got a few things that I've acquired recently,
1995900	2002860	but I may, depending on if anyone is able to play with me tonight, I may go back on my
2003500	2010460	adept attempts for DBD. And you know, a lot of people have been asking like lately, you know,
2010460	2016060	has the change to any of the, like the healing or any of that, you know, how do you feel about
2016060	2020940	and I'm like, honestly, with the way I play, it hasn't changed a thing. It's still the same.
2023100	2029740	So that's it. All right. Also, I just want to add, there's a really good video out there
2029820	2033500	of how all the metas have changed over the course of the game being out.
2034220	2040460	And people need to stop bitching. Okay. It used to be a lot worse. All I'll say to that is
2041100	2046060	Infinite Freddy. The game, I mean, I've played a little bit of Dead by Daylight this week as well,
2046060	2052780	and overall the game's in a decent place. I still think like some killers don't hold up well against
2052780	2062300	others. Um, but also tunneling. My God is just, I have an idea. What do you think about this? And
2062300	2068620	this is just a pie in the sky idea. What do you think that if somebody was the last person hooked
2068620	2074860	and they get picked up again, maybe they get some type of increased wiggle, like their wiggling
2074860	2079500	becomes stronger because they've been picked up back to back. I don't know. Just a, just a theory,
2079740	2085740	like a built-in boil over type of thing. I like, I like that as an idea. And of course,
2085740	2091740	my other one for camping was that the hook timer stops when the killer's in a certain
2091740	2098300	distance from the hook. I'd support that too, for sure. So I think that's the one little tweak that
2098300	2104380	would be great. Yeah. But the, like the perk metas seem like they're in a, like, I feel like
2104380	2109260	there's nothing where it's like people have to take a certain thing anymore. Like, I feel like,
2109260	2113420	you know, I'm sure some players would disagree with that assessment, but I feel like, again,
2113420	2117660	like use it comparatively to where the game has been before much better, much better place.
2117660	2122780	You know, the, the series of perks that I bring in, which is like typically botany knowledge,
2122780	2129980	self-care balanced landing and, um, urban evasion. Nothing really has changed with those
2129980	2137180	over the, since I've started playing survivor last year. Yeah. And they tend to be stable.
2137820	2143660	They tend to be fair and they're good for me playing like a ninja because of my mouse.
2144300	2149180	Not to get, not to get too far on DBD. Cause I know not everybody out there plays it,
2149180	2153660	but I just want to say, you know, cause you know, it is an ongoing game. A lot of people play huge
2153660	2158860	on Twitch. Um, I really love the perk distortion. I pretty much run it in every build right now
2158860	2162780	because it suppresses auras for the killers. And there's a lot of killers that run things
2162780	2167740	to read auras. So basically they can see where you are for a few seconds and distortion kind
2167740	2173740	of suppresses that a certain amount of times in a match. Um, which is nice. Yeah. Um, I,
2173740	2180060	I love that perk, but right now when I'm running solo queue, my favorite build to run is, uh,
2180060	2187260	kindred bond, open-handed distortion. And what that does is that, uh, kindred allows everybody
2187260	2192540	to see the killer and the other survivors when you're on a hook, but open-handed increases the
2192540	2198860	aura range. So if a killer is proxy camping, you, you see it, you see, and this, this came into play
2198860	2206540	on a match I did on, um, raccoon city with, um, I want to say it was a pig that was very obviously
2206540	2211100	going around the hallways. Well, sorry, Jamie, I don't pick the killers. It was, uh, that was just
2211180	2219260	patrolling the hallway back and forth, but because of kindred open-handed, my team could see how she
2219260	2224780	would pace this way, pace that way, pace this way. So the minute she started pacing the other way,
2224780	2229420	unhook run away the other way she wasn't pacing and it was great. So I love that perk for it.
2230460	2236140	Yeah. Uh, well, my, my whole thing is that it's hard for me to go without my urban
2236140	2242940	and my balance landing because those are because of how I have to play urban is like my bestie and
2242940	2246780	you wouldn't believe the number of chases I've gotten out of with balance landing.
2247420	2250940	Oh yeah. Balance landing's great. Or quick rescues.
2250940	2253180	All right. And that was your DVD update. All right.
2254540	2258140	Darsakra, do you think we may be one of these days we need to just give in and have a side
2258140	2263420	to Dead by Daylight show? Well, I've already been thinking about it, but I kind of want to do
2264380	2268220	one that's in character. Uh, yeah. And I, I always say,
2268220	2271820	Oh, this show would be a great idea. And then I'm like, Oh, Rob, stop overextending yourself.
2272540	2275740	Don't commit to anything. Well, I want you to be a character,
2275740	2279500	but it means you don't have to do it all the time. Okay. That's fine. All right.
2279500	2285580	Yeah. How good is your German accent? Who are you? Oh, Felix. You want me to be
2285580	2291260	Felix? I'm thinking. All right. We'll see. I think it would be a hilarious Dwight.
2291260	2298860	I can't speak German, but I can, if you like. Anyway, uh, Dark Knight asks, isn't there a new
2298860	2305100	killer coming? Uh, if yeah, there's rumors out there. And if DVD stays on its current timetable,
2305100	2309980	we should know in about three weeks who the next killer is. I'll just say so skip forward
2309980	2314700	30 seconds. If you don't want to maybe spoiler, but potential spoiler out there, I'm assuming
2314700	2318620	you already know this Darksakra. The new killer is rumored to be the singularity,
2319420	2323020	which makes me think a robot type of killer. Maybe,
2323820	2326540	Oh no, I was thinking maybe a commentary on AI or something.
2327180	2333820	Singularities have to do with gravitational, uh, anomalies in space when the word singularity
2333820	2340620	is typically being used. And so my thought is that we have our, an alien.
2341580	2347900	Hmm. I'm not saying like aliens, you know, as in, you know, you know, xenomorphs,
2347900	2354060	but I'm saying something that has like a black hole power or, or some sort of gravitational
2354060	2360220	ability. Um, that would be my thought, uh, Dark Knight in chat says someone said, Megan,
2360220	2367580	I fucking wish like, I talk a lot of shit. I talk a lot of shit about dead by daylight,
2367580	2373660	but if by some grace of God, Megan were to become a killer in the game, like I, that's it. I will
2373660	2382540	become a full-time dead by daylight streamer done. Or should I say period. Well, you know why they
2382540	2389340	won't do Megan? Uh, kids. She appears to be a child. Yeah. Kids. A big reason that they're
2389340	2396540	using the Japanese Sadako and not the stupid, you know, terrible movie Samara for Ringu because she
2396540	2403340	was 19. And they did a grownup Yuichi. Yeah. And on top of that, did you, I might've said this
2403340	2409900	before, but she is the first canonically intersex character in Dead by Daylight. Or a video game,
2409900	2414780	I think. We'll see. Um, and Steve and Nancy are 18, even though they're in high school and
2414780	2420460	stranger things in DVD canon, they are 18 years old. So yeah. Anyway, let's move on. Sorry,
2420460	2423580	Loki. I know you're a big fan of dead by daylight, but what do you want to talk about?
2424140	2429100	Oh, I was going to say, if it was going to be the singularity and you're saying robot, the first,
2429100	2436380	the only thing that comes to mind is of course, uh, the oral knots rendition of C-3PO,
2436380	2441820	who always talks about the singularity, uh, creepy-o. So that would have been hilarious.
2441820	2446940	Imagining like an, an evil C-3PO killing people. No, we would've got that.
2446940	2453100	There wasn't, there was an evil protocol droid in the old extended universe for Star Wars,
2453100	2457100	if I remember correctly. May the 4th came and went. That was the perfect opportunity
2457100	2459820	to say something like that. If that was ever going to be a thing.
2459820	2463980	And we've passed both revenge days, the revenge of the fifth and the revenge of the sixth.
2463980	2470460	Yes. Yes. So Dark Knight says maybe the Terminator. I, I don't think it's going to be
2470460	2474380	licensed, but I obviously I'd eat that kind of stuff up to be honest.
2475100	2484940	Terminator was already licensed to, um, uh, but characters, characters get licensed multiple
2484940	2489180	times. Sometimes it doesn't have to, it depends on the contracts, of course, but like, you know,
2489180	2493740	the stranger things stuff. Well then they unlicensed it. So, but, uh, Texas Chainsaw
2493740	2499260	Massacre, they've, they've dug their heels in saying that despite the upcoming game for Texas
2499260	2504300	Chainsaw Massacre, that they're not pulling Leatherface from a DVD. So, but I wish they
2505260	2507660	playing him and I play it, hang again, playing against him.
2508460	2510460	All right. Let's talk about other games.
2510460	2514060	We'll get, we'll get Dracula and Renfield. That'd be funny. Um,
2515900	2521900	so let's see. I played, of course, a DDR extreme this week. I played not a lot of it,
2521900	2526140	uh, like 30 minutes because it took me some time to get the cabinet hooked back up.
2526140	2530940	Um, I was having issues where I wasn't getting any video and that's because I forgot that it
2530940	2536700	goes through a board to do that. And I had it plugged in the wrong spot. So I finally got that
2536700	2541500	all working and everything works great. And I'm very excited that the cabinet is not broken
2541500	2549980	because that would make me very sad. Um, then of course, uh, lots of Minecraft. So I like really
2549980	2555340	grinded Minecraft this week. I was trying to get my video out this weekend, but I got sidetracked
2555340	2562300	with other things I have to do first. So a part of that is developing a mod. That's going to work
2562300	2570780	with, um, the stuff that we have right now in channel 64 to help bring in the custom 3d models
2570780	2577180	I have for the robot masters themselves. So I finally finished that. I mean, there's about 99%
2577180	2582300	done today. I it's working at the tweak, some of the models so that they look nicer and everything.
2582300	2586700	Um, and I got to go commission the rest of those cause I only have the first three done,
2586700	2591420	but yeah, lots of building. Like I did a ton of building this week. It was
2592780	2599420	just really large builds, three of them. I, I built another giant mega man enemy, which I've
2599420	2603900	already kind of teased that out there on the internet and stuff. So it's, it's awesome.
2604540	2609980	Um, and I just need to edit my video now, uh, which is going to be this week. I'm just trying
2609980	2616620	to keep up cause like I'm, I have to keep some base to get done by like, we were targeting only
2616620	2623100	a certain more, like a certain amount of time left in the season. It's still a lot of time,
2623100	2628380	but I got a lot to, I need to do. Oh, cool. My camera. I was just about to say you had a weird
2628380	2635420	hiccup. Like, uh, I thought it was, uh, um, uh, internet like spike, but I think you might've had
2635420	2641340	a brownout or something. That was weird. No, no, nothing's flashing over here. Weird. Just the
2643020	2647820	I'll do it. Do we do turn it off, turn it back on again? That's usually the trick. All right.
2648780	2653340	Um, well, really quick while you're playing with that, let me ask you about this because you're
2653340	2660300	like the, um, Minecraft guy around here. Minecraft legends. I know that just came out. Is that
2660300	2666220	something I should, you know, be caring about or pass? Like what's, what's the deal with Minecraft
2666220	2673820	legends? Um, it looks interesting. It's like an, and I guess like a more like a real time strategy
2673820	2682860	game, but it's also, um, I don't know. It's, it's not like in the same sense as, um, like a command
2682860	2690460	and conquer or something like that. It's more of like a, um, I don't know. I really don't play a
2690460	2695740	lot of real time strategy games. Okay. I don't know what's up with the camera. It's the software.
2695740	2702220	It just keeps crashing. So I don't know. I mean, I could just put no background, but no one wants
2702220	2711580	to see that. Um, so basically just, I haven't really played it too much, but you, you build
2711580	2717020	different structures that then allow you to create units and you use those units kind of
2717020	2721660	like direct them to go do stuff. And as far as like gathering resources, you have your allies
2721660	2726300	that go and collect resources from a certain area. I don't know. It didn't really seem that
2726300	2732940	interesting to me. And honestly, like the more I saw of it, it's still not very interesting. I
2732940	2737260	hear it's fun and it's probably worth checking out at least on game pass because it's free.
2738140	2742540	Well, it's not free. You're paying for game pass, but it's included with game path. So,
2743500	2748060	you know, it'd be worth checking out for that. Um, is it something that I would play like longterm?
2748060	2752220	Eh, I don't know. Like I'd be more interested in Minecraft dungeons than it. And I haven't
2752220	2756460	even played Minecraft dungeons yet. I play a little bit of Minecraft dungeons. I enjoy it.
2756460	2760380	It's good. Yeah. That looks fun. Um, it's just legends. Like I just don't,
2761340	2768220	I don't know. It seems weird. Like just the, the way it's set up. Like I wish it was more
2768220	2772540	like a traditional RTS game where it's like, that's why I used to love doing like with
2772540	2776620	command and conquer red alert is just, I wouldn't even really play. I mean, I would play through all
2776620	2782700	the story missions and stuff, but my most favorite thing doing was just creating skirmish matches
2782700	2787660	where you just have a random map or you create your own map and then you just put you, okay,
2787660	2791260	I'm going to have one faction here, one faction here, one faction here. And you just all play
2791260	2795660	against the AI stuff. And it was a lot of fun. Like I used to do that for hours, but
2797180	2802220	this, I just, I don't know. Not really interested in it. I don't know why.
2802220	2806940	Uh, Minecraft dungeons is good. It's, it's basically an ARPG, a very competent one,
2806940	2813180	uh, that is meant to be played on a controller. It's a, it's a lot of fun. I like it. So yeah.
2813180	2819500	All right. Well, um, if you're all done, uh, then I will go to my gaming week. So my gaming week,
2819500	2825580	um, let's see, my gaming week was, uh, I played a little more final fantasy one pixel remaster
2825580	2832700	because I actually completed the platinum trophy. So I have now platinum two games on PlayStation
2832700	2837820	with Diablo three and now final fantasy one pixel remaster. Uh, all I had to do was hunt down a
2837900	2843660	warmack, which is like a one in 64 spawn in the last dungeon where you get Tiamat. And that was
2843660	2849260	it really, uh, the other things were very easy to pick up. So, um, yeah, that was, that was that.
2849260	2855980	And then pretty much, uh, the majority of my week, otherwise I started playing final fantasy origin
2855980	2861100	stranger of paradise. That was the other big game I started playing. And, uh, this game has
2861100	2865900	been interesting. So I I've kind of stayed away from it until it dropped in price. And at some
2865980	2871100	point it finally did come down to 20 bucks. So it's been on sale, I think like permanently or
2871100	2876860	whatever to 40 bucks. And then some places put it on sale, like target, Amazon, et cetera,
2876860	2881820	for 20 bucks. And I think I mentioned this on the show last week, I picked up the PS4 version
2881820	2887180	because it has a free upgrade to PS5. So I've been playing it a little bit and I am enjoying it. Um,
2887180	2892460	I like the combat system and how they incorporate the final fantasy jobs into it a lot.
2892460	2896380	I like that you can flip back and forth between like, Oh, I'm a red mage. Oh,
2896380	2903740	now I'm a Ninja. Like you can do that except you are limited to only two until you stop and you
2903740	2908860	get to the cubes on a map that you can change it. So it is a little bit limited in what you can do,
2908860	2915820	but, um, you know, I, I understand there are some technical limitations or what have you with that.
2915820	2921260	So, um, that's, that's a bummer. Otherwise, like some of the maps are really cool. And what I didn't
2921260	2928060	realize that this game does is it actually, even though the story is basically an alternate
2928060	2935500	universe type of final fantasy one story, it actually incorporates maps from other final
2935500	2942620	fantasy games. Um, like for example, one of the early areas you go to says, this is like dimension
2942620	2948860	14, where the pirates hang out and dah, dah, dah. And it's because it's, uh, the pirate fight from
2948860	2953420	final fantasy one, which is in the town of Provoca early on you fight a pirate. Well,
2953420	2958540	what they did, they took the final fantasy 14, Cistosia dungeon, which was a pirate layer in
2958540	2963500	that game and made it like the map that you go through to get to the pirate that you fought in
2963500	2967980	Final Fantasy one. And like, there's another map later on that was from Final Fantasy 13,
2967980	2972460	and it has the weather mechanics. If you've ever played 13, there's that map with the orbs that
2972460	2977020	turn it from rainy to sunny. So I think that is actually one of the coolest things that final
2977020	2982060	fantasy origins kind of brings to the table is yes, it's a retelling of one, but it incorporates
2982060	2988460	the other games. The story itself is just as ridiculous and over the top as all the trailers
2988460	2994300	made it out to be. Um, it kind of, you kind of notice that maybe some corners were cut on some
2994300	3001660	things they couldn't pull off. Like you talk to NPCs on the map, the main map, you just hit start
3001660	3006700	talk. And then like all these different NPCs, like, I feel like there's a town mechanic that
3006700	3011340	was just removed. Uh, for whatever reason, maybe they come and pull it off. I don't know. Also,
3011340	3019500	my biggest annoyance with the game, there's no map. Really? There's no map? Like what year is
3019500	3026060	it? 2023. I can't hit a button and get a map. Give me a break. So, but otherwise overall, I am
3026060	3033420	enjoying the game enough as, you know, transparent as the story may be. And, you know, as tunnely as
3033420	3038460	some maps might feel, I don't know. I don't get as frustrated with it, but, um, I think I would
3038460	3044460	have maybe thought 70 was too much, but 40 is fine. 20 is better than five, but 40 is fine.
3044460	3049580	So, um, that's, that's my take on stranger paradise. I saw much more of the game to finish.
3049580	3054060	I've only gotten through like maybe five. I haven't even got the first, I think I'm on the
3054060	3059820	map to get the first crystal, but I've done every side quest off stream. So I'm trying to like
3059820	3065020	stream my gameplay, but I do all the side quests off stream. So yeah, that's, that's been a
3065020	3070620	change your paradise. All right. Um, we're going to get into some more news and what else is going
3070620	3076860	on in the gaming world this week. So we'll go over to you, Loki. All right. Sounds good. Um,
3076860	3086460	so this week we had, um, some disappointment, red fall, uh, the big first party supposed to be
3086460	3092780	banger of a game came out. Um, and it was not, not, it was not a good game.
3092780	3095740	Well, um, I want to point something important now. I'm sorry. I don't mean to cut you off, but
3096940	3102940	in the, in the eyes of critics and the pulse on social media, it doesn't appear to be a good game.
3102940	3106860	The only reason I'm putting it that way is because I've had people that have come into my chat that
3106860	3111420	are like, red falls fine. Once you get past the first 45 minutes, like it sounds like it might
3111420	3114460	have a rough introduction, but once you kind of get past the first part of it, like there's some
3114460	3118380	people that are like, this isn't as bad as people are saying it is. No, it's technical issues. I
3118380	3123900	think it's actually, it's not so much the story. It's just that the world is empty. A lot of times
3123900	3133820	the AI is bad. The gunplay is bad. The frame rate is bad. Um, it's, it's a lot of things.
3133820	3138700	It's not just like, well, you know, it's not like a Saint's row. Well, I mean,
3138780	3144620	Saint's row is bad too, but, um, it's, it's not one that's like, you know, subjectively bad. It was
3144620	3150700	just that like tech, it's a, it's a fallout 76, basically. It's, um,
3150700	3155340	That might be an interesting comparison. You could, you could, well, it's also Bethesda,
3155340	3163500	you could, um, enjoy it, but it's a slog to get through all that stuff to enjoy it really
3163500	3171740	for a $70 game. And the Polish that the studio has been known for in Dishonored and, um,
3171740	3177740	time loop. And, or what was it? Uh, what was the game that they had before that? Death loop? Yeah,
3177740	3183020	that's right. Death loop. Yeah. Um, death loop, you know, that had, those were very polished
3183020	3188620	games. And now this comes out and it's like, not so much. So because of that, you know,
3188620	3192940	Just quickly, some comments from chat. I'm sorry. Uh, DJ Rama S says, most people I know that got
3192940	3197660	the game, said it's pretty good. Meesh says, I honestly liked it. Questbuster says, as a fan of
3197660	3202220	Arcane, it was disappointing to see what their reactions in general were. Some streamers did
3202220	3206620	play it through to the end, if only because they wanted to see where the story went. One of the
3206620	3212300	terms I had heard about the game is that it was aggressively mid, you know, and I wonder, and I,
3212300	3217420	I've kind of seen this take online too. I can't take credit for this, but I feel like I'm getting
3217420	3223500	a sense that people that paid $70 for it, not happy. People that are getting it included with
3223500	3230300	game pass, content. Because they didn't have to pay anything extra for it. And I think I could
3230300	3234860	see where that is definitely a reality is that, yeah, if you didn't spend 70 bucks on this game,
3234860	3237660	and it's just part of this monthly thing that's in your budget anyway, you're probably like,
3237660	3243260	oh, this is cool. This is a fun distraction for a little while. Just a thought. Yeah.
3244220	3250860	Of course, you know, folks are kind of upset with how it turned out. And, you know, Phil Spencer,
3250860	3256140	you know, kind of took, you know, responsibility for that and basically said, you know, there's
3256140	3262220	nothing more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community just to kind of watch the
3262220	3266540	community lose confidence. Be disappointed. I'm disappointed. I'm upset with myself.
3267100	3271820	Um, you know, basically saying, you know, I think back to the announcement of 60 FPS,
3272700	3276860	and then we weren't shipping 60 FPS. That was kind of a punch right to the chin
3277820	3282300	a couple weeks ago, and then seeing the game come out and the critical response was not what we
3282300	3287900	wanted. It was disappointing. So I kind of picked myself up and what can we learn? How can we get
3287900	3293980	better? One things that I'll fight is a sort of what we want, or sort of what went wrong.
3293980	3299820	There's clearly a quality and execution of things that we can do. But one thing I will not do is
3299820	3304620	push against the creative aspirations of our teams. I know a lot of people will say, hey,
3304620	3309260	you've got teams, teams know how to do one kind of thing and just force them to do one kind of thing.
3309260	3314540	Well, yeah, I agree with that. Because, you know, obviously, that's not necessarily bad,
3314540	3318620	you know, sure, you should give the teams the creative freedom to make the type of games that
3318620	3323580	they want. But then again, you should also not force them to make games that they're not used to
3324060	3331900	a, you know, what was it? I can't, I can't, well, let me, why are you sitting on that? Let me just
3331900	3338140	say like the the thing I will credit Phil Spencer with here and big kudos, quite honestly, is that
3338140	3344860	at least he takes responsibility for the issue. He doesn't try to deflect it onto it was this
3344860	3350620	other thing or it was the team or I was, you know, but he takes accountability. And you know what,
3350620	3360140	I'm gonna be honest, name another US executive that does that in gaming. Nobody, you can't.
3360140	3365900	Japan, you can, you know, we had, of course, Iwata, the infamous pay cut, Miyamoto with the
3365900	3371260	Wii U underperformed, took a pay cut. That's why people have a lot of respect on Iwata's name and
3371260	3376300	remember him fondly. But I digress, you know, this this is about certainly and you look at a
3376300	3383260	lot of other CEOs running companies over here and it's not it's a lot of refusing to take
3383260	3389020	accountability for anything. Obviously, I'm shining a fucking spotlight laser beam on Bobby
3389020	3395980	Kotek with this, right? Not being able to take accountability. Now that said, like, I get it
3395980	3404460	that he's taking accountability for that. But yeah, there is a but but but not only is the game
3404460	3410460	back, you know, like technically not polished enough, but they knew it because they didn't
3410460	3418060	allow him they embargoed the game reviews until after the game came out. They did not give pre
3418060	3424300	release code out to these publications. So they they tried to control the narrative and not let
3424300	3432060	people know how bad of shape the game was in at launch. Yeah, no, I can say kudos to Phil Spencer
3432060	3437580	for taking accountability. But at the same time, you ultimately allowed this game to go out to the
3437580	3444780	wolves. Like, yes, you have to also be accountable for that. And there's some other you know, a lot
3444780	3449660	of comments about the QA team and chat She-Hulk also with this comment here, which is I think,
3449660	3453740	you know, the approach a lot of people would have She-Hulk 10 and chat says it is in a pre
3453740	3459660	alpha stage game, but in six years 2029, it will be a classic. And you know, Phil Spencer talked
3459660	3465100	a lot in that statement about story and creative freedom and that's not the complaints I'm hearing
3465100	3470620	about the game. I'm maybe I'm reading the wrong things. I'm not hearing complaints about the story
3470620	3475180	or what the game is trying to do. I'm hearing complaints about technical.
3475180	3481500	Even the presentation of the story is not great. Because like the way they did it is like, this is
3481500	3487180	once again $70 title, you look at like other games that they've done like Dishonored and whatnot,
3487180	3493900	they've got like real time kind of cutscene type stuff that there's like voice acting and
3493900	3498700	everything in that their stories that they had here were done kind of like a slideshow.
3499900	3503660	It's like ridiculous. It's like a slideshow not even like a comic thing. But it's like
3503660	3508860	it was still frames that they slightly move across the screen and stuff like that. Like,
3508860	3513020	that's not even necessarily like a pre presentation, like a stylized presentation
3513020	3519180	or anything like that. It's just, well, we just didn't want to animate these scenes. And so the
3519180	3524460	cut time, you know, development time, we're just going to put it out like this. Like it just it
3524460	3531660	screams like corners cut. And, and it's not even I wouldn't even blame the QA team this surely the
3531660	3536780	QA team knows about all these issues. It's more of like what they had to prioritize. And they
3536780	3541260	forced them to get it out when they did. And I mean, we've got a story coming out a little
3541260	3545660	later on talking about some other future like announcements from Microsoft and stuff. But like,
3545660	3550220	it almost feels like that that's necessary now because people are like, well, if this is bad,
3551500	3556620	the other big game this year is starfield. That's also Bethesda and Bethesda games are like,
3557820	3558700	here's, you know,
3558700	3563900	here's the other thing and that take to go back to she hoax comment about is this a game that can be
3563900	3569340	rescued? Can it be the next Diablo three fantasy 14 destiny and this growing list of games that
3569340	3575580	got fixed after they were released? Can it be this? It could be, but here's my concern she
3575580	3581100	hulk and anybody else out there on these thoughts. Here's my concern. I feel like this game was
3581100	3586540	willingly thrown out to the wolves. I'm not sure I can piece together why yet, but here's the thing
3586540	3592060	is that starfall has been, or has been delayed, or excuse me, starfield has been delayed how many
3592060	3600700	times other X X-Box titles have been delayed how many times. So I feel like they'll delay. And in
3600700	3605820	fact, red fall was even delayed at least once. Wasn't it? So I pushed us to the summer a little
3605820	3612140	bit. They're willing to delay games to get it right. But for some reason they didn't do it with
3612140	3620300	this. And I wonder if this was the sacrificial lamb to counter the audience. And, and I think
3620300	3626380	E3VL nails it. They probably needed to release something due to investors. And I actually think
3626380	3633420	that it, I think nail that's the head. I think they had to say, yo, we've got to release something
3633980	3638780	now because otherwise people are going to start unsubscribing from game pass. There's nothing to
3638780	3644380	play on it. Although I think HiFi rush was a great addition, but I get it. You can't let HiFi rush
3644380	3648780	is not going to fund game pass for 12 months, but you know, I get it. There's gotta be these
3648780	3653980	big releases, but there's a part of me that can't help but feel this was the sacrificial lamb to
3653980	3659660	get people to stop bitching. The Microsoft isn't doing anything. Well, it's not helping that you
3659660	3665740	had these 10 pull titles. So this in Starfield this year, plus also the acquisition of Activision
3665740	3670700	Blizzard. Well, the Activision Blizzard thing is kind of falling through right now. This isn't very
3670700	3677420	strong. It all's now pinned on Starfield. If that's not strong. But there's, there's Forza,
3677420	3683740	there's Fable, there's Setsuna's Revenge. There's all these games Microsoft's had in the pipeline
3683740	3689900	for a very long time. But like, look at these acquisitions, though, like what, what good has
3689900	3696060	it done? Like, you know, so far, we have our first thing from Bethesda, which has not been strong.
3696060	3700940	And whereas the studio has been strong in the past, this particular portion of Bethesda. I mean,
3700940	3706540	I was gonna say HiFi rush was also Bethesda. I would say that was probably the best thing in the
3706540	3713580	first three months of this year. So it was pretty good. Yeah, some you lose some. I'll say I'll say
3713580	3720060	it was a great argument for game pass. In some ways, as is this. Again, I go back to what I said
3720060	3724060	before, if you paid 70 bucks for this, you're pretty pissed off probably. But if you got it as
3724060	3729820	a part of game pass, you're not bothered. Yeah, exactly. You're you're you're less bothered by
3729820	3734220	because it's like, well, that's fine. I'll just go play something else that there's tons of things on
3734220	3739580	there. Like, I don't it's Yeah, that certainly helps. It certainly helps with the conversation
3739580	3746060	of all these games being $70 too. I mean, because that game pass was like 15 bucks a month, you know,
3746060	3751980	that's already like a quarter of the year or third year. And then some five months at least,
3751980	3758300	you know that you have here for just the price of one game. I mean, you can definitely play a game
3758300	3763900	within that time. The other thing, of course, you know, along with that, he made comments talking
3763900	3768220	about, you know, because of this, you know, even starfield, you know, being on the platform, he
3768220	3772380	doesn't feel that that's enough to get people that can, you know, basically trade in their PlayStation
3772380	3776700	fives for a series X or S. I mean, who's gonna really trade in their system? I think most people
3776700	3782140	buy a second system. But But yeah, I think it's more of a long game for a lot of these studios
3782140	3787500	that they purchase, you know, once all these titles come out, they'll probably, you know,
3787500	3791820	build a bolster everything. I mean, not everything is gonna be perfect. Like Redfall to me wasn't
3791820	3795260	very exciting of a game anyways, leave it even when they were talking about the preview. Yeah,
3795260	3799420	it wasn't really on my radar either. That's why I'm not super bothered by a lot of this. Like,
3799420	3805980	yeah, exactly. Like if starfield's garbage, then yeah, I'll be disappointed if starfield isn't
3805980	3811740	good. But like, I mean, I fully expect we know Bethesda proper to have a certain amount of jank
3811740	3817660	to their games. And that's just, that's the charming part, right? It's charming. Like when
3817660	3821900	it's not like game breaking, like if it's just like, just charming jank.
3822940	3827420	It's community theater. So sometimes some of the some of the bad acting you're inevitably
3827420	3830860	going to see in community theater is part of the charm, right? It's just like, it's just like,
3830860	3837580	was it Saints Row now? Like, so gearbox has been pushing, you know, volition. Saints Row's got a
3837580	3842620	bunch of updates that are coming out in DLC, that they're seeing that they're fixing the game. And
3842620	3849100	like, I don't even want to look at it anymore. Like it, this game is not even like, it's just
3849100	3855500	bad. Like it's not, it's not stupid jank like it, like the older games were, but it's just,
3855500	3861580	it's bad. It's bad jank. It's not a good jank. Yeah, I get it. All right. Anyway, I think we've
3861580	3864540	talked a lot about that. Let's move on. We have some more stories to get through for tonight.
3864540	3870220	Let's talk about another game that is coming out really soon. It's kind of wild how fast June is
3870220	3876380	creeping up on us with all these releases and it's Final Fantasy XVI. And Final Fantasy XVI
3876380	3884300	apparently has been banned in Saudi Arabia of all places. And why is Final Fantasy XVI being banned
3884300	3891820	in Saudi Arabia? Because apparently it has to do with LGBTQ content. In fact, one tweet went so far
3891820	3898460	as to say there is an explicit gay sex scene in Final Fantasy XVI and that is why it was banned
3898460	3902700	in Saudi Arabia. I'm going to call that out right now and say that is not the truth.
3903580	3910380	That is not Squares MO. That is not Squares MO. And here's the thing. I think that is a
3910380	3914860	miss. I don't want to say mistranslation, but I think that's a misunderstanding of the word
3914860	3923100	explicit because I bet Saudi Arabia called it explicit in their review because two men.
3923900	3924940	Yeah, two men pecking.
3924940	3927100	Is the Final Fantasy VII remake banned there too?
3930620	3932220	I mean there's cross-dressing.
3932220	3940460	Yeah, it's true. So I believe that maybe the review board in Saudi Arabia called it explicit,
3940460	3945740	but I think we all know that if a guy is giving another guy a hug or saying I love you or
3945740	3949980	something, that's not explicit. And I'm sorry, this is not going to have two dudes going at
3949980	3955180	it behind the Chocobo stable. That is not what this is, okay?
3955180	3957500	Are they going to play the Chocobo team now?
3957500	3957900	What's that?
3962700	3967660	Let's get... You know what? Not that I would ever do Boilesque, but if I did,
3967660	3968780	that's going to be my song.
3968780	3977100	Mike, do you see what Mike said?
3977100	3979820	Mike Defton chat called it Choco Back Mountain.
3984540	3988300	You know what? How many of you in chat? Put one in chat if you
3988300	3993340	would get on the stripper pole to Crazy Chocobo. All right.
3993740	3994240	Anyway.
3996860	4001980	That depends on the first part. Would I get on a stripper pole?
4001980	4006860	All right. Thank you all for the ones in chat. Thank you. All right. Here's the thing.
4007820	4012300	And here's my serious point with it is that I think there's been a rumor for a little bit
4012300	4018860	now that this game is going to have an openly gay character in it. And so this type of banning makes
4018860	4022380	it seem like, okay, this is just confirmation that yes, we're going to have an openly gay
4022380	4028060	character in the game. No, they're not going to be boating. It's just, there's a guy probably
4028060	4033180	having a love thing for another guy in the game. Cool. I would say it's the first openly gay
4033180	4036780	character in Final Fantasy because I don't think it's the first gay character in Final Fantasy
4036780	4044220	because you're not going to change my head canon. Fang and Vanille, they were not just sisters,
4044220	4049020	okay, in Final Fantasy 13. All right. Everybody kind of reads differently into it and that's
4049100	4055900	fine. But this will be the first game of openly gay character. However, usually at this point,
4055900	4062300	because I love the Final Fantasy series, I love the fact that this is June and this game is
4062300	4067660	literally releasing Pride Weekend. I just want to say, usually I'd be busting out the confetti
4067660	4073900	cannons and the rainbow flags going, hooray, this is wonderful representation. I'm roadblocked a
4073900	4082140	little bit because I feel I can't celebrate because whereas they may have done a good thing
4082140	4087740	here, we all know they did a not great thing when it came to racial representation and the response
4087740	4095580	to said thing. And that continues to be an issue. As I've stated on the show before, I believe it's
4095580	4101340	an issue much bigger than just this one game and Yoshi P, but it is an issue and it holds me back
4101340	4110940	from being able to go, yay. Because even though I like to think because I'm an ally, I can't
4110940	4116540	celebrate unless we're all celebrating and we're not all going to be celebrating. So it's a bummer.
4118140	4122380	Well, that's how I feel about folks playing Blizzard games.
4124140	4131180	Well, and everybody also draws their lines in certain places. So that's how I feel about
4131180	4138220	certain social media websites, but it is what it is. SSJ went ahead and met with a very interesting
4138220	4143820	comment saying, doesn't the Saudi public investment fund own part of Square anyways? Not saying that
4143820	4148140	they have a say in the matter, but just interesting to think about. Oh no, very interesting to think
4148140	4154940	about because we've heard about how Saudi investments more and more and more in certain
4154940	4160060	gaming companies and this whole, and there's a whole, I don't want to get too far down this
4160060	4165260	rabbit hole, but I have to just as somebody who is gay and I'm not going to apologize for it
4165260	4171180	on this particular program. Saudi Arabia has also been like, actually, wait, I don't want to
4171180	4175260	misstate this. I don't want to get this wrong. I think it might be another country.
4178220	4187740	There's a country that criminalized LGBTQ in the media this week that then said,
4187740	4192060	oh, but we don't want to discourage gay people from coming here and visiting and spending their
4192060	4196060	tourist dollars. They don't have anything to worry about if they come out here.
4200060	4206620	No, it wasn't Uganda, Rama. Maybe it was Qatar during the World Cup. I feel like it was Saudi
4206620	4210220	Arabia in the news this week. No, I think you're right. I think it was.
4210380	4215340	Yeah. So I apologize profusely if I am misappropriating that comment, but
4217340	4224860	I'm not able to Google in the moment here. But I just remember seeing it cross my timeline and I
4224860	4232780	was like, if you don't treat us all with respect, you do not have the right to these dollars,
4233500	4245660	period. I think it goes for any factor that you feel strongly enough. And people will
4246860	4261740	look in judgment at anyone who says they're an ally who does this. If you're an ally to
4261740	4269100	trans people, you won't put money in Harry Potter. If you're an ally to women, you won't put
4270300	4280700	your money into things that have hurt women. If you're an ally to having free human rights all
4280700	4285420	over the world, you won't visit places with those massive human rights violations.
4285420	4294300	Right. SSJ 100 Matt doing the research and finding out apparently Saudi Arabia owns 4.32%
4294300	4299100	of Square Enix. That is very interesting, actually. And part of this I hadn't considered
4299100	4304620	before, to be honest, that Saudi Arabia actually has a stake in Square Enix and now is suppressing
4305340	4310700	arguably one of Square Enix's biggest releases of the year in their own country. It's just wild to
4310700	4315180	me. That's how much they don't like gay stuff. It's just wild.
4315180	4319020	I'm also posting in the chat, but for anyone who wants to look, if you look up
4320060	4326620	the Human Rights Watch website, they have a map of where there's anti-LGBT laws by country.
4327900	4335340	And so I think everyone owes it to themselves and others to be educated on this and make ethical
4335340	4335820	decisions.
4336140	4341980	All right, let's move on to something happier. A follow-up, actually, of something we talked
4341980	4345900	about a few weeks ago, because I remember we were making our own predictions about this story,
4345900	4352380	but now we know what, DarkSakura? Well, we know who is making it into the
4352380	4361260	video game hall of fame, and those are going to be Computer Space, Barbie Fashion Designer,
4361260	4367260	The Last of Us, and Wii Sports. I believe that I named three of those.
4368780	4372540	I'm trying to go back and find the receipts if I save that document from that episode.
4373740	4381180	I might have my notes from when I, no, I just have my classic game lists.
4381180	4384140	Yeah, I'd have to go back to that episode. I really should have saved those guesses.
4384140	4386780	I know I said Barbie, and I know I said Computer Space.
4387420	4389820	Yeah. But at any rate,
4391580	4403260	these are all games that had absolute influence and notability for what they contributed to
4404140	4409580	video games in popular culture and in general.
4414940	4421100	The first one, of course, being the first commercial video game that was
4421100	4428620	Computer Space. If you think about it, in 1970, there wasn't a video game market.
4429580	4435580	This began it. Barbie Fashion Designer was the first one to target girls.
4438620	4445900	Very gender role oriented, but still. And Last of Us, it stood out for being
4447020	4450620	more than a game. It being a full story experience.
4451180	4451680	Yeah.
4454060	4459740	And of course, Wii Sports was the one that gets everybody playing the game.
4459740	4462060	Targeted at retirement homes. Just kidding.
4464140	4469580	I mean, but still, it could get children into gaming. It got the elderly into gaming.
4469580	4475900	Because make no mistake, yes, it's physical activity, but it is also gamifying physical
4475900	4480620	activity, which can go a long way. I mean, that's sort of the approach I've been taking to
4480620	4487340	how I'm doing ballet. I set myself these levels to get, you know, it's gratifying to get a score
4487340	4492220	and it's gratifying to find yourself getting better at the game. It's the same thing.
4492940	4498700	And I honestly, well, brava. Those are some good selections.
4498700	4502780	Yeah, they're good. I seem to remember on my personal list, I'm pretty sure I had Barbie and
4502780	4507420	Wii Sports, but I know for a fact, I did not put computer space on it. And I'm pretty sure
4507420	4512460	I didn't put Last of Us on it because I kind of felt like Last of Us, I felt was a little bit
4512460	4517660	more of the recency bias with the TV show and so forth. But I'm not mad about the pick whatsoever.
4517660	4522140	Like I get it. I totally get it. You know, these are all strong picks. It's just, you know, the
4522140	4526700	short list, I believe had Wizardry on it. I think that was one of the ones that I had selected.
4526700	4531820	But still, it's a very decent, it's hard to be mad at this list for sure.
4533180	4537580	I'm double checking the other ones. Well, yeah, in computer space,
4538860	4542700	one of the important things about that is that their developers went on to establish Atari.
4542700	4543200	Yeah.
4543900	4549100	Okay, there was also Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, FIFA,
4549660	4554380	GoldenEye 007, NBA 2K, Quake and Wizardry. I think I might have mentioned Quake.
4554380	4556860	Yeah, I feel like Quake was on my shortlist too, but yeah.
4557740	4567260	But no, I totally agree with this list of winners for the reasons listed. They were all notable.
4567260	4574700	And I do actually completely agree with The Last of Us being on there, because I think it is one
4574700	4581980	of those few games that has pushed the border of entertainment, you know, between how much of this
4581980	4587100	is narrative and how much of this is game and the emotional investment involved. Because I
4587100	4592300	don't think I've talked to a single person who's played it that hasn't gotten somewhat emotional
4592300	4593420	over parts of the game.
4593420	4602460	Yeah. And I get it. Again, I can't help but feel like the recent success of the HBO show
4603100	4609820	lent itself to that. And how much is that a reflection of the original game, especially
4609820	4615900	compared to some of these other older titles? But at the same time, sure. Obviously the fact
4615900	4619820	that the source material lent itself to be able to make something like that, I get it. I understand
4619820	4624700	why it's on the shortlist and why ultimately they picked it. Maybe I'm just being an old man saying,
4624700	4629020	but there's older games they should have played. I get it. There's got to be a contemporary title
4629020	4634700	or two to make everybody pay attention. It's so funny because this is the same week as the Rock
4634700	4639420	and Roll Hall of Fame, right? Because we've seen all those posts about Missy Elliott made the
4639420	4643580	Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Because if you're not already aware, because they put in Dolly Parton
4643580	4649900	last year, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is really like the Music Hall of Fame. It's not just
4650700	4657420	rock music. It's all music basically. But anyway, I digress. All right. Let's move on to a game that
4658380	4663820	will this, will this end up in the Hall of Fame someday? I don't know. I don't know, Loki.
4664460	4676380	It might, but like, yeah. You know, Dead Game, of course, Pokemon Go hit its lowest revenue in five
4676380	4680780	years. But of course, you know, Niantic isn't confirming that to be the case. Of course,
4680780	4688220	why would they? So according to the market research tool App Magic, they have determined
4688220	4695900	that in the month of April, that the revenue was down to $34.7 million, which is the lowest monthly
4696460	4704060	game revenue since February 2018. But Niantic says nope, nope, nope. In fact, revenues up.
4705020	4711820	Um, I mean, cool. That's still making quite a bit of money. I would like to make
4711820	4720060	$30 million in a month. Deft in chat took the words right out of my mouth. Niantic responding
4720060	4727660	to this so fast and not to the community is hilarious and sad. I actually think I'll take
4727660	4731820	out the word hilarious and just say sad. I understand your usage of it completely
4731820	4737020	Deft, but I just want to focus on the negative here. There's a rare thing on this show. I love
4737020	4743020	games and I try to be very positive about games. And I've been trying to be very positive about
4743020	4750780	this company too. This continues to piss me off and nothing exacerbates it more than this example.
4750780	4758700	They responded to this story within a day. They still have not responded to the community. Fuck
4759260	4767020	off. It's so upsetting. Well, gotta please the shareholders, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Deft says,
4767020	4770220	believe me, I'm not laughing in a happy way either. No. And I get the way you meant it.
4770860	4776060	Sometimes you have to laugh because you've expended every other emotion.
4776060	4781580	I guess it's sometimes why people laugh at funerals. It's how we process grief.
4781660	4791340	Anyway. Yeah, it's, I mean, obviously, like, I don't believe it. I don't believe that they were
4791340	4797100	up. I think that obviously it's starting to come around. But like, still, it's a lot of money that
4797100	4802460	they're making. Like if one starts getting down to the single digit millions, and let's call it,
4802460	4808460	you know, that they're suffering. But right now, it's like, oh, no, they only made $34 million.
4808940	4813660	I can tell you right now, it's not like they're breaking the bank. They didn't put $34 million
4813660	4820700	worth of development into the game during the month of April. So they're making plenty of money.
4821260	4826940	Like, it's just, I don't know. It's, it's so wild with Niantic. So Niantic's putting out a
4826940	4830700	new game this week. I don't know if y'all know, but that Peridot is finally releasing, at least
4830700	4834860	in the US. I don't know if it's a global release or just the US, but it's coming out this week. So
4834860	4839660	do with that info what you will. I will say this. I found out they're working on another
4839660	4845420	application and it's, I've been out for a little bit in testing. It's called Truffle. And it's the
4845420	4850860	type of social media, social network they're working on. It's only in beta test in the Austin,
4850860	4855740	Texas area right now, because I believe they soft launched it with South by Southwest in Austin,
4855740	4861020	Texas. But it's interesting because we remember the words about Niantic purchasing a social
4861020	4865900	network and what were they doing it for? And it appears it's this, and it's an interesting type of
4865900	4874140	your friends pointing out the cool places in town and the hotspots with these, this app. It sounds
4874140	4880300	interesting. Yeah. It almost sounds like a, a sort of an evolution of sorts of four square.
4880300	4884540	So I'm curious to get, I can't tell you cause I can't use it. It's only available in Austin right
4884540	4889020	now, but it's interesting to see how Niantic goes in all these other directions. And that's why I
4889020	4895420	feel like again, Niantic on some, on some principle, I don't think it's going to be hurt
4895980	4902220	by the shit they're pulling in Pokemon go and, and the potential revenue being lost, you know,
4902220	4907900	whether it's factor perceived or whatever it is at this point, because they have all these other
4907900	4911820	things going on that seem like they're really interesting and probably going to be positive,
4911820	4917740	but it's so weird to watch a company like literally leave money at the altar.
4919420	4923660	Or on the table, whatever you want to call it. They're literally leaving money at the table
4924380	4928780	by doing this. I it's, it's just, I've never seen anything like it in gaming.
4931260	4939900	I mean, yeah, I don't know. They feel it's a, it's a, they feel that it's a gamble. I mean,
4939900	4947020	they just look at the numbers. We can, we can't see their backend data. So to them, you know,
4947020	4954860	yeah, it's, it's a balance between pissing off the fan base and pissing off the people that
4954860	4960860	are paying for these in game purchases. If it doesn't upset the whales, then whatever.
4962780	4967820	I can't see in our chat right now says you could most likely chalk up most of the industry's
4967820	4976220	problems to shareholders and execs. Oh, this show turns 21 next, next month. If there's one lesson,
4976220	4982700	I want you to take from 21 years of orange lounge radio. It's that every, everything that's wrong in
4982700	4989500	this industry is shareholder isn't execs. Every bad decision ever made in gaming was made in a
4989500	4995420	boardroom. It wasn't made by an artist. It wasn't made by a level designer. It wasn't made by a QA
4995420	5001420	tester. It wasn't made by the hardworking people on the front lines. It wasn't made by it. Every
5001420	5007260	bad decision was made in a boardroom. If you could take anything from 21 years of this show,
5007260	5018220	take that. Enjoy. All right. Anyhow, moving on. I think we're over to, oh, me talking about
5018220	5023820	Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. Ah, yes. After all, I have been playing this series a little bit,
5023820	5028460	at least the first game. I kind of got sidetracked from playing the second game, thanks to Stranger
5028460	5034220	of Paradise. But at some point I'll get back to it. Anyway, the sales have been bragged about a
5034220	5040540	little bit for the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. They have crossed 2 million units worldwide.
5041500	5046540	That's right. Now that these have been released on more platforms, Square has announced that they
5046540	5053340	have sold over 2 million units worldwide. In a tweet, Final Fantasy wrote, we're delighted
5053340	5057740	to announce we've shipped and digitally sold over 2 million copies of the Final Fantasy
5057740	5062860	Pixel Remaster series across Steam, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and mobile. Thank you all
5062860	5066860	for joining us. If you haven't, now's the perfect time. Yes, yes. Put that in there. Of course,
5066860	5073900	now that doesn't say if it's 2 million from 6, if you bought all 6, does that count as 6 or does
5073900	5081260	that count as 1? Because I bet it counts as 6. But still, not bad numbers for something that was
5081340	5087980	probably a smaller team to make than something like Final Fantasy XVI or, you know,
5087980	5093260	Forespoken or some of Square Enix's other recent releases. So, I'm sure they're feeling pretty
5093260	5098220	good about this number. It's a bummer they couldn't put out more physical copies because
5098220	5104780	there's a lot of people that still want those, can't get them. But anyway, I guess there are
5104780	5110620	other people leaving money on the table, who knew? But congrats on the sales. I hope it encourages
5110620	5116700	the remake of more retro. I hope we get something like this for more retro titles. Chrono Trigger.
5117420	5125900	Hello. It's Square. It's time. Square. Square Enix. It's time. Chrono Trigger. You've had
5125900	5130460	these Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters. You've had Chrono Cross. I realize that's probably not the
5130460	5135580	best example, but you fixed Chrono Cross a year later. You've done Live Alive. You've got that
5135980	5145660	Square. Chrono Trigger. It's time. Do it. Tactics 2, please. Thank you. All right, moving on.
5145660	5154140	Dark Sakura. For a moment, I was making sure that I wasn't muted because I had been munching. But,
5154860	5162620	you know, there's still that big news censorship issue going on in Russia, especially in regards to
5163580	5172140	their horrid acts against Ukraine. But a Finnish newspaper is doing something about it. The
5172140	5177180	newspaper is called, I am going to butcher this. That's not the name of it, by the way.
5178780	5187020	Helsing and Sonomat, they were bypassing Russia's censorship using Counter-Strike.
5187580	5197180	So, basically, the thing is that while the news outlets are blocked, foreign media and whatnot,
5197180	5213260	online games are not banned. And Counter-Strike is really, really popular in Russia. So, you can
5213900	5222540	make custom-made maps that anyone can download and use. And so, that is what this paper is pretty
5222540	5227820	much doing. In fact, they unveiled this on World Press Freedom Day, which was this past Wednesday.
5229580	5236060	They have a basement in one of the apartment buildings. And in a hidden room,
5236860	5246380	there are Russian-language reporting by newspaper war correspondents in Ukraine. So,
5246380	5254060	you can actually see what the true documentation is outside of Russia. And it's a digital room
5254060	5260540	lit up by red lights and plastered with news articles and pictures that report on the various
5260540	5266620	events going on. And on one of the walls, players can find a map of Ukraine that shows
5266620	5272460	where there are details on attacks on civilian populations and a Russian-language recording
5273500	5279980	of someone reading the articles allowed playing in the background. And basically,
5281580	5288140	these are escaping Russian propaganda. And then that map has been downloaded over 2,000
5288140	5297740	times though the paper can't track the downloads by geography. But even so, this is...
5298940	5305180	Actually, I'm gonna read this quote from one of the people behind this. This definitely underlines
5305180	5309980	the fact that every attempt to obstruct the flow of information and blind the eyes of the public
5309980	5323580	is doomed to fail in today's world. And this is like the modern equivalent of the air raids that
5323580	5331100	would drop flyers on countries during World War II. It's an awfully clever way to get through
5331100	5336860	that firewall of information. I will say it's fascinating that it's in a video game too,
5336860	5342140	but pretty cool for gaming because we don't always get associated with the good stories.
5342140	5345980	But this is super clever how they're doing this. The irony that it's in Counter-Strike,
5345980	5353580	which is an anti-terrorism TV team type of thing. And the fact that it's so popular,
5353580	5363020	I think that it has something like over 4 million players in Russia. If even a quarter of people
5363900	5371020	download this map on some kind of whim and then see all of this, they're gonna talk about it.
5371020	5375660	Of course, then we have the counter. How long is it gonna take the Russian government to start
5375660	5383100	noticing as well and shut this down? But at any rate, I'm glad the information is out there.
5383100	5390780	I'm glad that the truth is being known. They haven't shut down podcasts though,
5390940	5395900	because I don't want to shine a spotlight on anyone, but I know in our Discord,
5395900	5402060	we have somebody over there that participates with this show and is aware of what's going on
5402060	5411100	over there. They're not plugging up all the holes. Well, no, I think that it's impossible to
5411660	5417980	you know, to plug up everything. And on top of that, I wouldn't even be surprised if there are
5421820	5429340	maybe lower level politicians who don't really care for what their country is doing.
5429340	5433100	And they may have to tow a public line, but I wouldn't doubt that there are
5433100	5436620	sympathetic people who are letting the information come through.
5436620	5443740	Yeah. All right. Well, let's move on. We have some more stories. Let's go to this.
5444700	5450300	Timely with next month being the time when E3 would have happened, but you know.
5451340	5458620	Yes. So Xbox Game Showcase, which is going to be Sunday, June 11th at 10 a.m. Pacific time,
5459820	5465900	which they're going to have a Starfield Direct immediately following the Xbox Game Showcase.
5466460	5473260	More of like, OK, listen, Starfield's not as broken as Redfall. Trust us. You know,
5473260	5480460	we still have time to. So, yeah, I'm curious to see what that's going to look like.
5480460	5485500	Obviously, the Xbox Game Showcase is going to show us more of what the Xbox studios are working on.
5485500	5490140	So hopefully we'll see some more stuff out of that as well. And being that Starfield's got
5490140	5500700	its own direct. Maybe, you know, other things, so. Yeah, apparently also on June 13th,
5500700	5507340	they're going to be airing a Xbox Game Showcase extended and says it's a stream
5507340	5515820	that will host some interviews based off of the game announcements. I'm excited.
5516700	5522140	Yeah. What else from Microsoft Studios would you like to hear more about?
5522780	5530620	Fable. Yeah, that's a new Fallout game or like not necessarily the Fallout, but like
5530620	5537820	whatever was it? Obsidian is working on. Oh, oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. I can't remember
5537820	5542460	the name of the game. There's another game that they're working on. It's another medieval game.
5542460	5546540	Yeah, pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. They showed a preview for it at one point and I
5546540	5549180	totally can't remember what it was called now, but yes.
5550380	5554140	I would like to see that. I just like to see like it's more of the stuff that we don't know
5554140	5560060	is coming yet. Like, I think that's exciting. I'm still hopeful for Starfield. Like, I'm not,
5560060	5564300	it's Starfield's not something I'm like super excited about, but like, I'm going to check it
5564300	5570460	out. But like, it's I'm just like trying to see what, you know, stuff to anticipate, you know,
5570460	5577260	what new things are out there. I mean, you know, obviously for some other sports is cool. I mean,
5577260	5581660	I'm more excited about whatever the next Horizon game is. That said, I still haven't played the
5581660	5586940	last Horizon game or maybe I did play the last Horizon game. I don't know. Probably still need
5586940	5592780	to play the last Horizon game because Horizon's awesome, but I'm more excited about the Horizon
5592780	5600060	series versus like the mainline sports series. But I mean, I don't know. Let's see what other
5600060	5607260	cool stuff they have coming. All right. I wanted to mention as show 100 Matt in chat says, needless
5607260	5612620	to say that Sunday show role will be written on the fly to accommodate that. As is typical that
5612620	5616620	we've done in year past, usually what we do is we kind of block off the opening of the show to just
5616620	5621340	say, we're going to talk about whatever Microsoft unveiled this morning. So we've, we've done that
5621340	5626220	with the traditional E3 press conference schedule. If you go back a few years, usually we would say,
5627180	5630540	first half of the show, we're going to talk about Microsoft and Sony. Second half of the show,
5630540	5633580	we're talking about Nintendo. So, you know, we'll do something like that with whatever
5634460	5638780	additional press conferences we may get or information dumps that week. So yes,
5638780	5642460	sometimes we have to be a little bit flexible on the fly because we have no idea what they will say
5642460	5646140	because there might be something that blows us away. You never know. Something that didn't
5646140	5650620	make the show world tonight, but there are continued, it wasn't our discord.
5650620	5655180	Now I'll urge you all to go over to our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
5655260	5660940	But earlier today, there's more rumors going around about Sony's continued partnership with
5660940	5666460	Konami. And we know that the Silent Hill 2 remake is something that's exclusive to PlayStation 5.
5666460	5673980	Apparently those rumors are ramping up that there's also going to be a Metal Gear Solid 3,
5673980	5678220	for some reason, remake. It seems odd to me they're going straight for 3 and not doing the
5678220	5683260	trilogy, but that's what happens with these rumors sometimes is they're weird. That's happening. And
5683260	5688460	then something new in the Castlevania universe is rumored that's going to be a Sony exclusive,
5688460	5694300	a reimagining of Castlevania. Again, take it all with a grain of salt. But the reason why I say
5694300	5700460	all that is that that could be huge news if a Castlevania game comes out of nowhere. I'm sorry,
5700460	5706060	but that's bigger than almost anything to me because I love that series. I'd be so excited
5706060	5712620	if that happens. Assuming it's not looking like the Xbox 360 games and a little more maybe like
5713660	5724060	the PlayStation Saturn games. All right. If I'm looking for a new game to play, the Xbox app on
5724060	5730300	PC, because that's the thing is you run apps on your PC now, especially Windows 11, you can find
5730300	5735900	games based on accessibility features now. So you can actually go in and look for games on Game Pass
5735980	5744540	based on accessibility types of features. Also, so mean like narrated game menus, a steady camera,
5744540	5750540	volume controls. Those are some examples of things you can sort for in the Xbox app. Also, you could
5750540	5756060	also sort on the how long to beat. So this was already in there because I know you look at some
5756060	5760060	games and they'll show you like the estimation on how long is it to beat and how long is it to fully
5760060	5769660	complete. And you can actually sort on these as well. As an example, Mass Effect 3 says it takes
5769660	5775180	24 and a half hours to beat the main story, but 50 total hours if you want to do everything,
5775180	5778940	including side quests, which sounds about right. That's about how long it took me and I did
5778940	5784300	everything including side quests. So, but that is neat that you can sort for that as well,
5784300	5789820	especially the accessibility features. Very cool for folks that are looking for something new to
5790620	5795580	maybe can't keep track of, oh, this game has this, this game has that, and that stuff.
5796300	5802140	All right, let's take time now to take a step back in time with this segment.
5812940	5818460	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5818460	5823340	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5824060	5831260	But it's not just a game because once a month, it's a non-video game. What did you pick for us
5831260	5834380	this month, DarkSakura? I picked Operation.
5835820	5844300	Good pick. Because it's got some electronics in it. Yeah, some electronics. Very shocking little
5844300	5857180	game. Anyway, Operation is a game that originally came out March 27th, 1965 and went through very
5857180	5867500	few aesthetic changes until I'd say more recently. But it is a, it runs on batteries and it is a game
5867500	5873420	of physical skill that tests your hand, eye coordination, and fine motor skills.
5874220	5879820	It was developed, actually, the prototype was invented in 1964 by the University of Illinois'
5879820	5887020	industrial design student, John Spinello, and then he sold the rights to a toy designer named
5887020	5896780	Marvin Glass for $500 and the promise of the job. He never got the job. But it was produced by
5896780	5903900	Milton Bradley in 1965 and is currently produced by Hasbro and the franchise is worth about
5904700	5913660	$40 million. It is a variant of an older, older game that was popular at fairs. It involved an
5913660	5920940	electrified wire loop. But this one is an operating table. It's lithographed with this
5920940	5931340	lightness of a patient who's nicknamed Cavity Sam and has a large red light bulb for the nose and
5932300	5940540	no junk. And on the surface are different openings that are labeled with the names and functions for
5940540	5946940	different ailments that have plastic pieces in there. And then in general, you have to use
5946940	5953260	tweezers to remove these objects without touching the edge of the cavity opening.
5954140	5963260	So at any rate, and also one thing I think is absolutely hilarious at the Kaiser doctor's office,
5963260	5969260	not far from me, there's a giant painting of an operation table in the lobby and I think that's
5969260	5975660	fantastic. I'll take a picture of it next time I'm there. But anyway, you have two sets of cards
5975660	5982140	on the game and there's a specialist card that you get at the start of the game and extra cards
5982140	5986700	are removed from play. The doctor cards are shuffled to make a deck and are placed face down.
5987660	5996220	The American and Australian versions, you take turns taking a doctor card and the top doctor card
5996220	6003820	and then offering a cash payment for removing the object. So the player in control uses a pair of
6003820	6009660	tweezers that are also referred to as electro probes connected to the board by a wire to remove
6009660	6015500	the piece without touching the metal edges of the cavity. So if you remove it, then you turn the card
6015500	6021740	over and the value is what you're paid. A failure will allow you to use your specialist card for
6021740	6028300	that ailment to remove it for double value. And then if you lose your specialist card or if no
6028300	6033580	one is holding it, the doctor card is returned to the bottom of the deck. And then the cards
6033580	6043340	are both types removed from play as soon as the pieces are retrieved. If you draw a
6043340	6050060	certain doctor card while holding its corresponding specialist card, then you can deliberately fail
6050060	6057100	the first one and then use the second one for that double value. But the winner is the player
6057100	6065340	that has the most money after all the pieces have been removed. And it is definitely a challenging
6065340	6074940	game because these little holes in there are kind of deep. The wishbone to me was probably
6075500	6084220	one of the harder pieces. The Adam's apple being that it's round is also a fairly difficult one.
6084220	6093900	I always found the butterflies easy and the rubber band. The charlie horse was also hard.
6093900	6099260	I thought the rubber band was a monster. Oh, no, thank you. I just have to read this comment.
6099260	6104860	This is so funny. Bonz006 says, so this game was undercover black market organ harvesting.
6105740	6106240	Yeah.
6108940	6118220	Pretty much. But at any rate, the pieces are as follows. There's the Adam's apple,
6118220	6124300	which is an apple in the throat. And that's $100. There's a broken heart. There's a heart with a
6124300	6131260	crack on it. That's also $100. The wrenched ankle, which is a wrench in the ankle for $100.
6131260	6138300	Butterflies in the stomach, which is a butterfly in the stomach, $100. Spare rib, which is two ribs
6138300	6144700	fused together as one piece for $150. Water on the knee, which is a pail, a little plastic pail
6145500	6153020	for $150. The funny bone is a cartoonish bone for $200. A charlie horse is a small horse that
6153020	6159820	rests near the hip joint. I always think of charlie horses as being in the ankle, but never mind.
6160460	6165900	Ryder's cramp, which is a pencil in the forearm for $200. The ankle bone connected to the knee
6165900	6170700	bone. That's the rubber band that is stretched between the two pegs. It is the only non-plastic
6170700	6178780	piece and the challenge where you have to insert it rather than remove it. And it comes from the
6178780	6187100	song Dem Bones. Anyway, the wishbone, like the chicken wishbone located in the chest for $300.
6187660	6194940	Brain freeze, which is an ice cream cone in the brain for $600. That was added in 2004 when
6194940	6201660	Milton Bradley had fans vote on a new piece. And the promotion was called What's Ailing Sam?
6202220	6209100	And the top prize was a $5,000 shopping spree. The other contenders were tennis elbow and growling
6209100	6214300	stomach. And then of course the last piece is the bread basket, which is a slice of bread.
6214940	6224300	It's a very small notch. The notch is removed to make you able to grab it, but it's a
6224860	6230460	it's a thousand. I honestly, I never thought that one was super hard. It seems to me like some of
6230460	6237660	the quote easier ones were some of the harder ones. As far as other variations, the very first
6237660	6246540	variation of this by Hasbro came out in 2009. It was an update called Operation Sound Effects.
6247180	6252220	It was the only one to remove the buzzer and cards in place of the speaker. And so the game
6252220	6258300	could announce the pieces to be removed by the player using an audio cue such as twang for the
6258300	6265020	rubber band and a busy tone for the cell phone. There's a cell phone? But you had to press Sam's
6265020	6270060	nose after removing the piece. And when all the pieces had been removed and Sam's nose is pressed,
6270060	6275340	the game plays a victory song. It also will allow you to do standard operation
6275340	6280780	by sliding the power button to a lightning bolt. There are licensed versions out there,
6280780	6287340	including a few Spider-Man ones. There's a Fallout version where you operate on Vault Boy.
6287340	6297580	And the rads alarm is Sam's nose buzzer. In 2020, there was one called Operation Pet Scan,
6297580	6304060	where you removed objects from a dog's digestive tract. The Dutch version is called Dr. Bibor,
6304060	6311020	which is translated to Dr. Shakey. That's a better name for the game.
6311020	6321180	I like that it was included, Dr. Bibor. Plus, I found a rad video in the YouTube-related clips
6321180	6325900	that say SpongeBob SquarePants Operation Game. Oh, is that legit?
6325900	6332620	Yeah, I think so, yeah. The funny thing about Operation, this is a great pick, by the way,
6332620	6339020	Darzaga, and I actually have a recent story about this too, which is wild, is that I went on the
6339900	6349500	Star Trek cruise a few weeks ago, really, a couple months ago, and they actually did a live on-stage
6349500	6355660	game of Operation during the variety show. They had a giant oversized operation board,
6355660	6360060	and they had the doctor, because Robert Picardo was there, they had the doctor
6360060	6364060	go against somebody else that was in the audience. And of course, the person in the audience won.
6364620	6370940	But it cracked me up because it's so obvious. The entertainment company that does the Star
6370940	6375340	Trek cruise is infamous. The very next week, they do a cruise called the 80s cruise,
6375340	6381500	and they get a bunch of old 80s bands and the 80s MTV VJs, like Martha Quinn and stuff, go on the
6381500	6387420	cruise. It's that. It's very obvious that they had an operation thing on the ship for 80s week,
6388780	6393580	and they were like, how could we use this for Star Trek week? Oh, we'll get the doctor to play.
6394700	6399980	You know, I'm also looking at Hasbro's website, and in addition to the PET scan,
6399980	6405900	there's an Operation X-Ray matchup, and there is Operation Junior.
6409980	6414700	Zenmonkey11 talking about SpongeBob in chat says he doesn't have organs or bones.
6416060	6419100	Don't put logic into Milton Bradley's Operation game.
6419980	6421820	How dare you put logic in the fantasy?
6421820	6422860	You will not go far.
6423820	6425020	It does not belong here.
6425900	6431900	DJ Rama S is asking about the 80s cruise, Kurt Loder. Kurt Loder is more of a 90s icon,
6431900	6439980	and believe it or not, Kurt Loder is more like 90s. I associate him with the news that,
6439980	6444380	I know this is terrible, but it is what it is. I associate him with the news that Kurt Cobain
6444380	6449340	passed away, because remember that was the big thing. It broke, you know, and it's Kurt Loder.
6449420	6455340	Kurt Loder is like in his late 70s. Not saying that it's too old to cruise, but that man is a
6455340	6461500	lot older than you think, because he was kind of older on MTV for the average. I mean, the sad part
6461500	6465580	is he was probably our age when he was on MTV, but that was older than most of the people you
6465580	6471340	saw on MTV at the time. So Kurt Loder's a little older. Oh, thank you. Rama says he's 78. So Kurt
6471340	6477180	Loder's a little older. Probably even this, I would say those 80s, like Martha Quinn's
6478380	6484860	gotta be maybe what, like late or early 60s, late 60s maybe. So, you know.
6484860	6485820	I love Martha Quinn.
6486380	6493260	Yeah. Anyway, ZenMonkey11 says, I miss 90s and early 2000s MTV. Don't we all? Don't we all miss
6493260	6498780	that era when MTV actually played music videos? But the reality is, now we just see music videos
6498860	6505500	whenever we want on YouTube. So it's interesting. Anyway. All right. Thank you for taking us down
6505500	6513260	memory lane with the non-video game of the month operation. All right. Let's do some other news
6513260	6518540	around the gaming industry in a segment we call Rapid Fire News. Loki, you want to start us off?
6519180	6526780	Yeah. So we have a cool indie game being made, or I should say like, it's not like a deep,
6526780	6535180	sort of a de-make, but probably an improvement. It is a custom Zelda Game Boy game based off of
6535180	6545580	one of the CDI Zelda games. So they've taken that now, the story of that and created a top-down RPG
6546220	6549180	in the style of a Game Boy. I covered that last week.
6549180	6556380	Oh, you did? Okay. Yeah. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't done it already.
6557100	6562940	Um, and then we may have some more casting news regarding the new moral combat movie that's
6562940	6568780	supposed to be coming out, the new sequel. Um, the rumor is that apparently Carl Urban will be
6568780	6572220	playing Johnny Cage. What?
6573260	6579580	It, yeah, I have a hard time picturing that. Like honestly, shaved Carl Urban maybe,
6579580	6583420	like just like right now in the boys Carl Urban. I don't really see it.
6584380	6588220	Somebody in Discord, it may have been Tiger Claw. Sorry if I'm misappropriating this comment,
6588220	6592860	but I believe suggested it could be an older, burnt out Johnny Cage, like an older take on
6592860	6597500	the character. And considering in the later Mortal Kombat games, Johnny Cage has a kid,
6597500	6603260	right? Cassie Cage. It may make sense to go that route. Could be interesting.
6603260	6604060	That makes sense. Yeah.
6606700	6611260	Multiple people in chat suggesting Carl Urban for Kano, but I believe Kano was in the last movie,
6611260	6621660	right? You know, though, I honestly, my, my ultimate Carl Urban is as Judge Dredd.
6623340	6626540	What has he been in lately? I just, I don't know anything outside of Star Trek.
6627900	6630620	That show. Okay. It's awesome. Got it.
6632380	6637420	Yeah. Tiger Claw says it here in chat. Thank you. Says I could see a Johnny Cage as an
6637420	6643420	aging actor who hasn't had a hit movie for some time. Yeah. It's, it's, it could be that take on
6643420	6649260	Johnny Cage. It's not the, the modern, younger take. And if they want to put in characters like
6649260	6655740	Cassie Cage and Jackie Briggs, they, they may do some, some aging, a little bit of the characters.
6655740	6658300	I love Cassie and Jackie and they need to be there.
6658300	6662220	Yeah. I, I would, I would like to see the more modern characters involved too.
6662860	6665580	The new Mortal Kombat movie wasn't bad. It was okay.
6665580	6669980	I never did see it. I'm lame. I still haven't seen the Mario Brothers movie.
6672540	6677500	I know you need to see D and D. See the Dungeons and Dragons movie. If you're going to go see a
6677500	6680940	movie, go see Dungeons and Dragons. I still need to see Guardians of Galaxy 3 that just came out
6680940	6685980	this week. But like, can I even see D and D anymore in theaters? Yeah, I think so. I mean,
6685980	6691740	I figured. Let's go. Wait, see Mario or D and D? Both. But are we going to theater hop?
6691980	6695180	No, we can do D and D. Like, like we're 17.
6696460	6700780	I think if you choose the two, between the two, I think you'll have more fun seeing D and D. Like,
6700780	6703500	honestly. I do want to see them both. I like Mario, but like.
6705820	6711180	I can't see since D and D's on Netflix. It's on digital now. Yeah. That's how fast,
6711180	6714940	yeah. That's how fast the movies are. Scream 6 is on Paramount Plus already.
6715580	6717820	That was just out in theaters like six months ago.
6717820	6719900	Oh, well then there you go. Watch it on Netflix.
6719900	6723740	I guess so, but I want to watch it again. I can still come to Dark Sakura's house and eat
6723740	6727980	popcorns. Yes, I have two courses of popping. Okay.
6730460	6735500	All right. Well, I think it's on like, yeah, because I don't know if it's on demand in the
6735500	6741580	sense that you can rent it like on demand. It's not like included with your subscription on demand
6741580	6747420	yet. It's probably still in theaters. I think Mario was dated for the first week of June.
6747420	6750860	I want to say I saw an early date for digital that was the first week of June.
6751580	6758300	But yeah, the days of like six months between theaters and those days are gone.
6758940	6765340	It's mere weeks now. It's pretty wild, but I kind of like it to be honest. Like,
6765900	6770460	and plus for those people, you know, not everybody is still comfortable going to a movie theater,
6770460	6774780	masked or not. Not everybody's still comfortable with that. So it, you know, for those folks,
6775420	6781500	they don't have to wait that long. It's not too bad. So. All right. Oh, Def says Mario was
6781500	6785580	supposed to be on demand this week. Are you kidding me? Well, if I just sit around Twitter
6785580	6790060	long enough, apparently I'll get a copy from Argentina. Like I thought there was news though
6790060	6796380	that got delayed because it was doing so well. So they don't want to immediately like cut into their
6796380	6803420	sales. I think they got pushed back. Zen Monkey 11 in chat says I watch it on VR on a big screen
6803420	6808140	like I'm in a movie theater. Then I eat Jelly Belly popcorn flavor. It's close to the real
6808140	6815180	thing. Dude. I used to love those Jelly Belly popcorn jelly beans. Now I don't eat them anymore
6815180	6822220	because LOL diabetes, but they were good. They were really good. Anyway.
6822220	6827420	Those are the only kind of jelly beans I can eat because of allergies, but I feel bad about eating
6827420	6832220	them now because of who they supported. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of Jelly Belly
6832220	6837100	at all, to be honest. But before all that happened, when I was eating them more, it was
6837100	6844300	that and toasted marshmallows by far my favorite flavor, just to be clear. All right. Moving on,
6844300	6851020	I think Dark Soccer, you have a rapid fire story. I do. Street Fighter 6 comics.
6853340	6857900	There was something that came out for free comic book day. Of course, the art is being done by
6857900	6864620	Udon, which has done many, many of the releases for the Street Fighter comics over the years.
6866860	6876460	But the Street Fighter 6 number zero was out. It had behind it, you know, folks from Capcom,
6878060	6885340	Genzo Man, Edwin Huang, and Matt Moylan. The first issue, though, did get pushed back and will
6885340	6893820	release on May 24th with other issues coming afterwards. So it is a lead in that follows Ken
6894540	6902460	as he is invited to a mysterious tournament that then endangers his family. And that's why
6902460	6913900	he apparently is parading around as a displaced person. So in the game. But yeah. But I mean,
6913900	6918380	and also, you know, for other goodies about it, there's going to be, you know,
6918380	6925020	a steelbook case and there's new music tracks coming out. And still more talks about a movie.
6928460	6932940	Good times. I can't wait for Street Fighter 6. I hope it doesn't get lost amongst the other games
6932940	6938140	for me. I like the demo. I did try the demo, by the way. I loved how you just fight random people
6938140	6946540	on the street. It was pretty cool. All right. Yeah. I love the time I played it. It was so
6946540	6952460	much fun. Shane showed up in chat and says I said something wrong. Did I say it was six months ago
6952460	6957260	that Scream 6 was in theaters? I meant to say weeks, six weeks ago, that these movies are
6957260	6961820	turning around fast. He says I said months, but sometimes I feel like he's gaslighting me. All
6961820	6969180	right. Anyway, let's talk about Xbox Game Pass and some new additions coming to Xbox Game Pass in
6969180	6973580	early May, which of course we all know Red Fall. We talked about that, but what else do you have
6973580	6978620	to look forward to on Game Pass? Ravenlock just came out on the 4th and coming out tomorrow is
6978620	6985580	Weird West Definitive Edition on series X and S. Also Shadowrun Trilogy coming out for PC.
6986540	6991420	This is, it's already on cloud and console, but now it will be on PC. So that is, if you're
6991420	6995660	thinking I've already played that on Game Pass, it's now going to be on PC. These are the tactical
6995660	7005340	RPG Shadowrun games now on PC. Fuga Melodies of Steel 2 will also be out. This is a day
7005340	7011660	one release and it's a sequel to the first Fuga Melodies of Steel. Some other games that recently
7011660	7017740	released on Game Pass, Besiege, Quantum Break returned if you weren't already aware, and then
7017740	7026460	some download games you can get. LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga now has Luke Starkiller in it.
7027740	7033020	I don't know if that's something you get free. Is it Luke? Like clone Luke from the books?
7033020	7036940	Oh, it is the early concept design of Luke Skywalker.
7036940	7042060	Oh yeah. Cause that was his name during the Blue Harvest days.
7043020	7046780	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,
7046780	7052540	some games that you'll be playing a little sooner than Starfield. Loki.
7053660	7060460	Yes. Darkest Dungeon 2 out on PC this week. Dookapon Kingdom Connect on Nintendo Switch.
7061100	7067260	Fuga Melodies of Steel 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,
7067260	7073980	and Xbox Series. Marvel's Midnight Suns on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And last but not least,
7074780	7080140	Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom Better Not Pirate Edition on Nintendo Switch.
7080140	7085340	I'm pretty sure that's the DLC for Midnight Suns because the Bloodstorm pack is coming out
7085340	7096620	as a download character. I think that maybe it, well, no, it's the actual game because it
7096620	7103420	launched on next gen and stuff. Now it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. But yes, also the
7103420	7110300	DLC is coming out for the Switch. The DLC is coming out and then they said something about
7110300	7115660	the Switch version being canceled. What? Oh, it's such a good game and people just weren't
7115660	7121340	giving it enough of a chance. I'm looking forward to the future Vampire Storm coming in.
7121900	7126860	Yeah. No Switch version for Marvel's Midnight Suns, which I think was shown at a Nintendo
7126860	7134380	Direct. Bravo. All right. Well, let's move on and check out what's coming out in Japan. We're
7134380	7139500	coming off of Golden Week. So what are the big releases this week? Well, on the Nintendo Switch,
7140460	7144540	nobody wants to go up against The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom because pretty much that is
7144540	7151100	the release. But like regular edition, collector's edition, there's an amiibo coming out for it.
7151100	7159340	There's third party covers, ear pod collections, a new front cover, a pouch, a hard case. You name
7159340	7164300	it, you can get it for Tears of the Kingdom and Zelda. Because as I was referencing earlier in
7164300	7169420	the show, we talked about it at the top of the show, this is the game that some people drop
7169420	7176940	everything for. So this is that game's moment. As far as any game willing to release against
7176940	7182060	this game in Japan, no, nothing on the Switch. Let me check the PlayStation 5 real quick.
7184060	7189180	No, there's nothing on the PlayStation 5 either. Nobody's willing to touch Zelda this week.
7190220	7193900	That's it. What about the PS4 if I go back that far? Sorry. I'm just like,
7193900	7203100	really? Nobody's releasing anything. No, not even on PS4. Zelda and that's it in Japan. Dark
7203100	7211340	Soccer. You're gonna like it. That's right. On May 11 for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch, we have
7212780	7222140	TT Isle of Man Ride on the Edge 3. We have on the 12th on Switch Legend of Zelda Tears of the
7222220	7229500	Kingdom. And that's it. That is fucking it. Sounds like a lot of stores are gonna make
7229500	7232700	their money off of Zelda this week and there really doesn't need to be anything else coming
7232700	7240460	out this week. I'm waiting for Puzzle Bobble. I'm just saying. No. Ooh, she's different. Okay.
7243020	7247660	I love this baseball's reference there, Dark Knight. Zelda the flamethrower,
7247740	7254220	merchandising. All right, moving on. We have some more headlines for you and then we'll get to your
7254220	7257420	calls and your emails. I think we actually have a couple emails tonight, so we'll get to those
7257420	7264540	and we'll get to your calls over on Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. But first, Loki.
7265660	7271340	Yes, and a new episode of What Year Is This? We have a brand new Double Dragon game coming out.
7271340	7278700	What year is this? Double Dragon Gaiden Rise of the Dragons. It is a brand new game
7280300	7288140	that I guess is a sequel to, or maybe a side story of, developed by Motus Games and it includes,
7288940	7293340	they have like some roguelite elements to it. There's four different missions you can choose
7293340	7299260	from that have randomized stage lanes. I'm sorry, hold up, hold up, rewind, backtrack.
7300140	7306140	You said roguelike in a Double Dragon game? Yes, they have some of that, but then there's also,
7307820	7314220	there's 13 playable characters. There's a two player co-op mode. They have even a tag team
7314780	7320380	like ability so you play as two characters at once type of thing. It looks interesting. It's
7320380	7327420	coming out on PC, Xbox consoles, PlayStation 4 and 5 and Switch. Don't get me wrong. I love me
7327420	7336060	a roguelike. I love a Dead Cells. I love a roguelike. Does everything need it? I guess so.
7336620	7339180	Okay, let's put it this way. I don't think it's necessarily like
7340780	7345580	roguelike in the sense that you play through different levels that are somewhat randomized
7345580	7354460	and you have money to unlock upgrades. It's as much roguelike as Ivan Iron Man Stewart's
7355340	7361180	super off-road. Okay, that game was fucking awesome. If you had called it an Iron Man,
7361180	7366620	Ivan Stewart super off-roading type of game, then I would have been no questions. 10 out of 10,
7366620	7370700	no notes. No, I'm just saying it's like they have purchasable upgrades or something like that.
7370700	7377180	Okay, well that's all right then. So that's the thing. Yeah, it looks cool. It's all done like
7378060	7385020	a retro pixel style type thing. I mean, it looks good. So, I'll check it out.
7386060	7387340	I have to, okay, hold on.
7390460	7394300	I have to look at this because even I'm thinking, like, Dark Tetsuya in chat says,
7394300	7399820	oh yeah, I want a new super off-road. And I'm like, fuck yeah. That's the fucking game I want.
7399820	7404460	So the first thing I had to look up was, is Ivan Stewart dead? Because I have no idea,
7404460	7408860	to be quite honest. I'm like, maybe there's a reason we have no more Iron Man Stewart.
7408860	7415660	I have good news, everyone. Ivan Stewart is 77 years old and is still with us on this earth. So
7415660	7421100	there could be another Ivan Iron Man Stewart super off-road game. And why we're not getting one,
7421100	7424380	I don't understand. Because he's sick of that shit.
7426540	7431340	You know what? And they're still making Madden games even after Madden has left this earth. So
7432060	7436300	I just, I don't understand. I don't understand why some sports series go on and on and on.
7436300	7439500	This is this game that never ends. It just goes on and on.
7439500	7444140	You know Madden fake, he's on somewhere with Elvis on their home planet.
7444780	7449580	But I'm literally sitting here going, this is a sports game I want every year and I will buy
7449580	7452300	money every year. Crickets.
7454380	7460060	Well, I mean, for that you have dirt. I mean, it's rally racing. It's not exactly the same thing,
7460060	7462140	but I don't know. It's not the same thing.
7463020	7466780	They had like a, well, they had an off-road Thunder, which is pretty fun. That was a
7466780	7474940	racing game. It's not the same, but you know, I would take another arcade game.
7474940	7479340	I bet if I fucking go to a round table pizza, some of them still have a fucking off-road cabinet.
7481580	7487740	Yep. That hasn't been cleaned underneath since 1993.
7487740	7493900	The monitor is like as dark as you remember the lights being in the, in the pizza place,
7493900	7497820	but nope. It's just the monitor that's burnt out because it's from the eighties, you know?
7501820	7506620	Oh my God. You know, there's, there's kids today listening to this program that have no idea
7506620	7511260	what Ivan Ironman Stewart, who, first of all, you don't know who Ivan Ironman Stewart is.
7511260	7516060	And second of all, you've never played his game. And that's, that's just a goddamn shame.
7516060	7517420	Let's just make it clear.
7517420	7519820	I had to explain to someone who Evel Knievel was.
7519820	7524460	Are you kidding me? SSG100Matt says he has 140 followers on his Twitter.
7524460	7529580	Rob has more followers than him. Are you, are you sure it's him or is this somebody else?
7529580	7530540	Like, is there photos?
7531100	7532620	Can't be certain anymore.
7532620	7537100	I know he can't be certain anymore. What's the at? Drop the at.
7541180	7542460	Hold on. This is important.
7542460	7546940	Nope. Yeah. Well.
7547980	7550060	Okay. Twitter slash Ironman Stewart.
7552700	7558300	Oh, wow. There's like videos and stuff. Are you kidding me? He has 160 followers?
7559820	7560060	Are you-
7560060	7560860	Following him.
7560860	7566780	I'm following him too. This, this, this is y'all go, go follow Ironman Stewart.
7566780	7575820	This is an official shout out. I don't understand that his likeness brought us the greatest
7575820	7580380	pizza arcade video game ever made. And y'all get to give him 160 followers.
7581820	7584380	This is what's wrong with gamers today. Get off my lawn.
7585500	7588780	Posting. Why isn't any, why aren't you guys following this guy?
7590780	7594300	Seriously? I want to know. All right. Oh yeah.
7595020	7599180	Oh no, please. Oh no. S. Jonah and Matt is checking for any questionable RTs. Oh,
7599180	7605340	please don't. Oh no. Oh no. I can't. I can't have him having retweeted. You know who from,
7606060	7607340	Oh God, please, please.
7607340	7608780	It doesn't appear. I don't-
7608780	7612380	Please do not have participated in cancelable behavior.
7612380	7615740	I have an Ironman Stewart. Please let me have this. Let me have
7617180	7620780	this vanilla latte fantasy, please. All right.
7620780	7621980	I'm sitting in the big chair.
7622860	7623360	All right.
7625500	7627340	And owls. He has an owl camera.
7629020	7635020	No, S. Jonah and Matt, legit a concern. I understand. I understand. I get it.
7636780	7640140	I mean, I don't see anything.
7640140	7643260	Okay, good. Let's just stop there. Stop digging.
7645340	7649420	Everybody stop. We agree if there's been no tweets in the past two years,
7649500	7652140	then everything else is figureoutable.
7652140	7652940	People change.
7652940	7659420	People change. People change. People grow. All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.
7660620	7663260	I can't move on from that. We have to worship the legend.
7663260	7664060	Right?
7664060	7675180	Hold on. Okay. At any rate, we have more sad closures going on. Sony shut down
7676060	7680460	the concrete genie studio Pixel Opus.
7682700	7686060	They put the announce that it was going to be closing down.
7690300	7694700	They are- Hold on. I'm trying to- Yeah. They were launched in 2014,
7694700	7696620	and their first game was Entwined.
7697340	7703260	And then they put out the announcement that the game was available same day.
7703980	7712380	And then they put out Concrete Genie, and that was nominated for two BAFTA Game Awards.
7713020	7716300	And then they were going to be working on something in collaboration with
7716300	7722220	Sony Pictures Animation, but now it's down. It's gone.
7724220	7729100	I remember when- That was the year I was at the PlayStation conference on the ground floor.
7729100	7732380	It was the year they announced Entwined. It was like the first announcement of the night.
7732940	7734140	And it was like, it's out today.
7734140	7735420	And they dropped it right there.
7735420	7742060	Yeah. I played it when I got home. It was decent. I think it was a $10 game, if I remember right.
7742060	7749100	It wasn't a premium title, but for a $10 game, it was fine. But that's a bummer.
7749900	7759660	Yeah. It makes me so angry when the little studios are consumed, or at least they're
7760620	7765260	you know, conceived. And then all of a sudden, nope, we don't think you're viable anymore,
7765260	7768860	even though you do really good things and have a lot of good potential.
7769820	7774140	It's just disgusting. It's all money.
7778380	7783180	SSJ100Matt, who's on the investigation assignment of Ivan Ironman Stewart for
7783180	7787980	Cancelable Behavior says, confirmed he's just a cute old man that watches
7787980	7794060	owls and cuddles with his dog. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for letting us have this.
7794780	7800460	Perfect. Perfect. We love retired life of having owls and cuddling your dog. Perfect.
7800460	7801820	Sounds like a dream. Perfect.
7803020	7803660	Barn owls.
7804540	7805040	Right.
7805740	7813100	Like he even has like camera shot, like the hutch camera where you can see the eggs and everything.
7813100	7815180	It's so cute. I love him.
7815180	7818540	Darth Tetsuya said, I had to refresh and now y'all are following him now.
7818540	7824060	LOL. Yes, we've we've gotten him up to 165 followers just in the short time we've been
7824060	7829900	doing this show tonight. I'm just saying the greatest pizza parlor game of all time,
7829900	7835500	his likeness and every pizza parlor in America and y'all gonna disrespect him with 160 followers.
7837980	7842140	How many followers does Perez Hilton have? Just out of curiosity.
7842140	7843340	Who cares?
7843340	7848380	That's my point. All right. Anyway, moving on.
7848380	7854220	Loki, I think I have to say that there's been some drama going on in the Dead by Daylight community
7854220	7864700	around our skull merchant Twitter. And yeah, there's there's a certain streamer has been
7865340	7871740	going very transphobic against this person. And honestly, I had forgotten that they existed
7871740	7877420	and that they followed them until the drama came to light yesterday. I'll tell you about it later.
7877420	7882700	But it's just like, sort of that thing that I think that we remember people in the background,
7882700	7888060	and then we sort of stopped thinking about them, you know, and I think retirement might have
7888060	7893100	removed some relevancy. So I mean, that could be a very big reason why there's less of a following
7893100	7899260	now that and is likely fan base from, you know, racing, you know, or offroading.
7900860	7905900	Probably your pre internet people. I'm just thinking about it. I'm trying to think
7905900	7913020	logically why. No, yeah, I get it. All right. Let's move on. Loki have more unfortunate news
7913020	7915580	in a similar vein of what dark soccer just talked about. Yeah.
7916300	7923900	Yeah, so unity is laying off 8% of its global workforce or approximately 600 employees.
7924780	7932620	Previously, they laid off about 225 people about a year ago, and another 284 at the start of this
7932620	7939740	year. So it says, you know, unfortunately, they haven't, they haven't decided to comment on the
7939820	7947660	issue. And apparently, in a recent interview, John Riccitello said that it's all about setting
7947660	7959660	ourselves up for higher growth. It's very clear we had too many layers. And I guess, well, he's
7959660	7965660	talking about like laying off would affect mill management, because they had too many managers or
7965660	7971980	something like that. Yeah, but not with like 600 people, you know, 600 managers, so I don't know.
7974380	7975100	All right.
7975100	7979260	Both the managers and the people that reported to them. Let's do the whole thing.
7980300	7982700	Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why exactly they were,
7983340	7986860	you know, what it was. And so you're not commenting on it. But lay off suck.
7988140	7991900	You know, there was a comment in Discord again, I apologize. I don't have it up in front of me.
7991900	7998700	But somebody had said that could kind of referencing, I think I'm putting a lot of words,
7998700	8001980	I'm stretching this comment, but basically suggesting, does this mean we're going to be
8001980	8007180	down to just one game engine, every game is going to be made in one game engine? Because if Unity
8007180	8012940	were no, no, I don't think unity. No, there's like tons of stuff. There's open source game engines
8012940	8018140	out there. Godot is one that you know, a lot of people use for different things. There's like
8018140	8023260	GameMaker stuff, there's, you know, running your own engine on Unreal. I mean, there's lots of
8023260	8029500	stuff that's out there. It's just, you know, a lot of these different things could be focused on like,
8029500	8033500	maybe they're not making enough money in certain areas that they wanted to like, for example,
8033500	8038540	mobile ads, like there's infrastructure that they're building it for certain stuff,
8038540	8043180	or maybe they're focusing on different areas that they're not necessarily going to focus on anymore.
8043180	8047180	I mean, I don't know, I've been solely far removed out of unity for a while that like,
8047180	8052140	I don't really know what's going on at the company over there. But I know there's a lot
8052140	8055740	of stuff that people didn't like, especially recently. I'm not sure if that all started with
8055740	8061020	John Riccitello. But like, there's a lot of things that they don't like where unity is going with
8061020	8066940	stuff. So you know, quest buster has some a plus takes in the chat and says, No way unity is doing
8066940	8071900	well. It's behind Honkai star rail and Genshin impact among many other games. Yeah, those are
8071900	8076940	huge games on Twitch right now. And pointing out also this is the I think really the a plus comment
8077420	8083900	but unity doesn't have Fortnite to fund it. Facts. That is a big, big facts.
8085100	8092140	Yeah. VX Jason XV Hello Hello says unity epic cry where I don't know if source two is still viable,
8092140	8095660	but I know it's out there. So yeah, all right. There are other options. Good to know.
8097180	8103100	All right. Well options on where to get your news about Zelda tears of the kingdom. You know,
8103100	8107260	again, this is going to be all over the all over Twitch the day this game is released. That's for
8107260	8110860	sure everywhere Friday, all these streamers are going to be playing it. But if you want,
8110860	8114540	you can watch the official Nintendo stream because there is going to be an official
8114540	8118860	Nintendo treehouse live showcase just before release. And you know,
8118860	8122860	Nintendo will be shutting down all of those streams that dare to play this game before
8122860	8129100	release. Although I don't know how they're going to do that with Europe, because actually Japan
8129100	8133500	will have at first. So technically streamers in Europe and Japan aren't going to be breaking the
8133500	8139020	law if they play. I hope they don't do that. That happened with some other game is that they shut
8139020	8142940	down all these European streamers saying the game's not out yet, but it's like, no, it was
8142940	8150540	out in Europe. It just wasn't out in the U S yet. So they better be careful. All right. Anyway,
8152780	8158780	there's going to be an official treehouse stream on May 11th, the day before the game launches.
8158780	8163740	There will be a Nintendo treehouse live. That's going to be the game counting down to its release
8164700	8168940	up to the midnight launch of Legend of Zelda, but I'm assuming that's midnight East coast time.
8169580	8177500	The stream starts at 9 45 Eastern time. And that's, yeah, gonna, gonna be something you
8177500	8181820	can watch while you tick down to the game, actually being available and unlocked on your
8181820	8189020	system. Fun. All right. But look out for spoilers. I would suggest if you do go to
8189020	8193900	watch that stream, hide the chat, because if I were a troll, I'm not, but if I were,
8193900	8197980	that would be the number one place I'd go to, to start screaming out spoilers. So hide the
8197980	8204620	chat if you do go to watch that stream. All right. With that, let's get to the listener round table.
8204620	8209180	We'd love to hear your comments and feedback. We're going to open up our discord over at
8209180	8212780	vognetwork.com slash discord. But first I think we actually have a couple of emails
8212780	8218460	that came in tonight over at participate at orange lounge, radio.com. There's okay.
8219260	8229260	Yeah, we got some. So going to the first one, if it will open, come on. Thank you. Oh my God.
8229260	8236540	Okay. Oh, big font. Okay. Hi. It's I can't see from Twitch and discord. The eighties and nineties
8236540	8241740	TV and mall talk takes me back. As far as the eighties, nineties TV, there should be a database
8241740	8246860	or guide that lists where these iconic shows are available. Have you seen the night court reboot?
8247420	8253660	Please spell out your words. People don't like the writing, but it has that eighties, early nineties
8253660	8261100	sitcom vibe that may either be the laugh tracks or, or, or how they record it. As far as malls,
8261180	8266380	my area still has a smaller mall, which is always packed as far as the accessibility modes and
8266380	8272940	sliders. I agree about slugs and snails. Sorry. I just vomited in my mouth a little bit.
8275020	8284460	Just the, the mention of them just as, as, as horizon, the whole flip-flop of the review bomb
8284460	8292140	crowd confuses me to no end. What PS I'm, Oh, I'm a straight white man and I don't like where
8292140	8297980	the U S is headed. Sorry to get political. As far as cloud gaming, people comparing Stadia
8297980	8301740	to streaming services and subscriptions, it was more like a storefront steam, et cetera,
8301740	8307980	in the cloud description, akin to O GPS plus games with gold or even humble bum, dual subscription.
8307980	8314780	I beg to differ. It was both. You could buy your games. You also had access to free games that
8314780	8321980	came with your subscription. So it was both. Side note, Luna is a subscription. There have
8321980	8328940	been people who want the ability to buy games there. My brain, I have to make myself remember
8328940	8335260	that PPL is people. Also people complain about the series. So why don't they allow Game Pass
8335260	8341180	subscribers to play purchased games on X cloud? People also complain about large file sizes,
8341180	8351340	but we cloud gamers were ahead of the curve. Also Nintendo uses EBITDAS. As far as the classic game
8351340	8356300	or non-game of the week, I am, am I the only one who thinks that some of these board games
8356300	8359420	that have been featured mentioned or would make great multiplayer video games,
8359420	8364060	mainly the ones that have electronic components, moving parts, examples, the Omega virus,
8364060	8369340	Forbidden Bridge and Crossfire. Anyway, I thought I'd give some general thoughts in the last episode
8369340	8375340	as well as others that have been rattling around in my head. Cool. Thank you. You covered a lot of
8375340	8379020	ground in that email. I'm worried I'm going to miss some points, but I think I caught the new
8379020	8383900	Night Court reboot, which sadly, no, I haven't watched it, but I've heard as far as like these
8383900	8387980	reboots of old shows go, I've heard it's one of the better ones. So it's one of those, I'll have
8387980	8394220	to binge it at some point and catch up on it. What was the other thing I wanted to mention?
8394220	8400380	Oh, the Xbox part, because that kind of caught me off guard. He, he said you can't play your
8400380	8408380	purchased games on xCloud. I thought you could if it was digital, but maybe I am mixing that
8408380	8413740	up with Game Pass because I do happen to have Game Pass, but you have to have, you know what,
8413740	8419180	you have to have the rights for cloud streaming. You know what it is? There isn't anything they
8419180	8424380	don't have the rights for cloud streaming on that isn't on Game Pass because that's how Microsoft's
8424380	8429100	been doing it. So I think I see the point being made. That's, I never stopped to think about that
8429100	8437740	though. That is interesting. I, I feel like though, as more and more devices get more cloud
8437740	8445900	gaming. And again, I think we are just 5g over the air accessibility, more of that. I think in
8445900	8452860	about five years, we're going to really see much more cloud gaming through 5g over air, um, to
8452860	8461420	revisiting some of those conversations. So anyway, um, I think I hit on all the key points I wanted
8461420	8465660	to respond to. Oh, I, there was also, I'm sorry, there was one passage in there. He said something
8465660	8470460	like, uh, he had a political opinion, but I'm, I'm a straight white man and I don't agree with
8470460	8474700	where this country is headed sometimes. Look, I, I'm not straight and I don't always agree with
8474700	8479740	everything either. Like this, this country is without getting too political, but it's going
8479740	8486940	to happen sometimes. There's just so much inaction that's happening as you see people
8487740	8494300	really rooting themselves in polar opposites. There are certain straight white men who need
8494300	8501260	to be removed. Certain ones, yes, but certain ones are fine. Loki's good. Loki can stay.
8503260	8509900	And I can't see has conducted himself with a wonderful grace and so forth. I don't see how
8509900	8517420	he's a problem. Um, anyway. And, and I do need to explain. Um, I, I, I had no problem with
8517420	8523500	abbreviations in the email, really. It's just my brain, the way I process information. Um,
8524300	8529340	I read by the shape of a word, which is how a lot of people read. But for me, if the shape is
8529980	8536060	not in a logical pattern, it's an autism thing with me. Like I actually literally stop and my
8536060	8542780	brain has to reset where I am until I get used to it. So this one is to say that's honestly,
8542780	8550060	that's where 90% of my grammatical problems come from is just that general, the way it looks,
8550060	8552780	not necessarily the way it is. Does that make sense?
8553660	8559020	Yeah. I think of those tests I've seen where it's like the letters are reversed,
8559020	8562700	but the words the same length and you should still be able to read this. Like I've seen little
8562700	8567260	things like that. So I understand when you say I look for a word to be a certain length. Like I,
8567260	8572060	I've seen weird memes that kind of flex that trait. Yeah.
8572700	8576780	And that's typically, um, we actually went through this in history of typography
8576780	8584060	is that the standard reader, this is why it's not a good idea to have all of your stuff in all,
8584060	8590220	uh, capital text because of a good reader will read the shape of a word.
8591100	8596460	Um, whereas a poor reader is going to stop and try to spell out each letter in the word. They're
8596460	8604700	not going to see the picture of it. Um, but at the same time, you know, when people have different,
8604700	8610380	you know, neurological issues, sometimes that doesn't work out in one's favor.
8612060	8615020	Interesting though, reading something by the shape of the word, I can actually see that
8615660	8620300	institute. Yeah, I get that. There's actually a test you can perform that if you take two,
8620300	8626140	uh, two same phrases, one in capitals, one in lowercase, and then you cut off the midpoint
8626700	8633500	on every word and then show it from the bottom up or from the halfway point up,
8633500	8637980	you can still read the words in lowercase. Not so easy in every case.
8638540	8643100	Interesting. All right. Anyway, there's some, there's a psychology of typography.
8643740	8648700	Let's see. We've had a typography tangents, uh, Ironman Stewart on Twitter. Uh, what else
8649580	8652380	this week's episode of OLR going to bring tangent wise. All right.
8652940	8659260	Dan got me pizza and it was delicious. Yeah. And I can't see, I understand that, um,
8659260	8662700	that you're legally blind and that's why, you know, it was perfectly okay.
8663580	8669820	It's just the way my brain operates and I had to stop and go, what? Okay. But yeah.
8671180	8674460	I feel like that might be your way of saying, don't take it personally. If I'm like,
8674460	8678540	why is this word shortened or what have you like, you just need a minute.
8678540	8686780	I think that to everyone I have to reset. Um, anyway, last email. Um, hi guys, Misha here.
8686780	8691660	I wanted to do a last minute game of the week for you guys. This week's games include included
8691660	8697660	on Xbox. I played red fall. Um, now I know many people hate the game, but I can see why,
8697660	8704860	but I'm having a lot of fun with it. It's your typical, uh, looter shooter type game to me.
8704860	8709900	It's like back for blood, but with vamps, it may or may not be better with co-op,
8709900	8715900	but here's the thing I don't like. There is no couch co-op. Like I thought would be like,
8715900	8720860	I thought it would be, and that's what I was expecting and didn't get. Other than,
8722140	8726300	other than that, it is a good game for what it is. That's pretty much been my game this
8726300	8729100	week outside of Nino Cooney on switch. Sincerely, Misha.
8730060	8733020	Well, thanks Misha. I know you're one of the people that were like red falls,
8733020	8736780	not as bad as everyone's saying it is, but that's it. I had no idea about the, uh,
8737340	8740300	lack of couch co-op. That's really important to a lot of people.
8740780	8746140	I also really appreciate how I can't see use the very, very big fun. It made it so
8746140	8751100	much easier to read. Cause all the other emails are like, I need a microscope.
8753020	8756940	Well, I think that's just default is I wonder if that can be changed in the reader,
8756940	8761340	but I don't know. I don't know to be honest. It can, but it was just like, Oh, font.
8762460	8767980	Nice. Yeah. Um, no, I mean, I can read down to a four point font, so
8768620	8775660	Oh, I just need to take off my glasses and get the monocle, but no seriously. Cause, um,
8775660	8780060	I'm supposed to actually have progressives, but the thing is it because I'm super nearsighted.
8780060	8784620	When I take off my glasses, I get super close vision, like microscopic vision. It's so,
8784620	8790380	but, but without my glasses, I can't see shit. I see blurs and not the band.
8791180	8796140	Um, Misha and chat says that reminds me, LOL. Is there a way to make the font bigger? Cause I even
8796140	8801340	have a hard time reading this. The, the quick and dirty way to try is, and it depends on your
8801340	8805580	browser, but hold the control key and use your scroll wheel to go up and down. Cause that'll
8805580	8809740	change the font, but that you can have mixed results with that. So do it slowly so you can
8809740	8813740	revert it back. If you don't like it. I believe it's very similar on a PC to how it is on a Mac
8813740	8818780	or on a Mac it's command plus to zoom. I think you can control plus to zoom on a PC. That is
8818780	8824540	what Jason's actually confirming control equals, which is the same key. I think. Yeah. So yeah,
8824540	8829660	something to play with. All right. Um, anyhow, that was it for emails, right?
8832060	8837100	Um, yeah, that's it. All right. Uh, I was surprised that there was more than one.
8838060	8841820	Yeah. Yeah. I guess me threatening to pull the plug on emails got people to say, Oh,
8841820	8845980	nevermind also. So I, I feel bad. I guilted people into it, but at the same time,
8845980	8850300	it's been lovely to hear from people in the mailbag. So maybe I don't feel bad. All right.
8851260	8857340	Participate at orange lounge radio.com. If you would like to say hello, uh, uh, this next week,
8857340	8861500	uh, we'd love that. I don't see any calls waiting in the green room, which is fine. Cause we're
8861500	8866460	coming up on about two and a half hours. So I do want to check in though, to see if there are any,
8866460	8871580	uh, last minute stories from Loki or dark Sakura. There are not. Yeah. I feel like we,
8871580	8875420	we hit them all this week. There wasn't as many this week as there usually are probably because of
8876060	8881020	Japan's golden week. But, um, I'm sure we'll see some more next week. And especially when we start
8881020	8886060	to get into early June, it's going to ramp up. Then again, I also expect the gaming industry
8886060	8892060	to be very quiet on Friday. Cause most people. Golden state pinball festival.
8893420	8898780	I want to check that out. It'd be fun. Is it running on Friday? Cause I can go on Friday.
8898780	8901260	Friday's Saturday and Sunday. Maybe I'll go on Friday.
8901980	8906060	I I'm still got work, so I don't know what's going to happen.
8906060	8910380	Okay. We'll compare notes. All right. I might have, I might have to blow some time.
8910380	8913900	I also want to go to, um, California extreme if that's happening again,
8913900	8918380	but watch this happening. I think it's probably going to be the same weekend that I'm
8918940	8922620	planning on going somewhere else, which I'm hoping I can finally talk about next week.
8923740	8927740	So, and, um, well, and then there's Twitch con coming up.
8927740	8928940	Yes. Yeah.
8929820	8936220	Which I, I finally have made enough money from Twitch to pay for my damn ticket.
8936220	8939500	Oh, that's great. Wait, are Twitch con tickets available?
8940620	8947260	Uh, I think so. I saw something about them posting them and then they weren't on the site.
8947260	8948460	So maybe soon.
8948460	8954300	Oh, Ooh. I can't see reminds me that this coming weekend is the next Diablo open beta.
8954300	8957180	That's right. Diablo 4 has another open beta this weekend.
8958540	8961740	I have plans Saturday though. So I don't know how much I'll really get to dive into that.
8961740	8964700	We'll see. Change your plans then.
8964700	8968700	I know change my plans for a video game. I mean, I've done it before. All right.
8970620	8977020	I've been sitting here going, do I take Friday before my birthday off and say it's because of
8977020	8982300	my birthday, but in my heart, I know it's to play a certain FF16, but we'll see. All right.
8982300	8983980	What did I do for my birthday?
8983980	8985340	You did a subathon.
8985340	8986700	I took the whole fucking week off.
8987660	8993100	I can't, I can't take that much time off. I mean, I can, but I just know like I have
8993100	8996700	these other things I'm doing that yeah, I'd rather have the time for.
8996700	9002380	Yeah. For, for me, things worked out and my work gives us a three days for the Thanksgiving holiday,
9002380	9005740	except in my group, we get to take them whenever we want through a certain period of time.
9006300	9009580	So I took them off for my birthday and then took a bonus day off. Cause I work a four 10.
9010540	9015660	That's the show and I'm at is our Google champion tonight saying California extreme is August 19th
9015660	9020780	through 20th. Excellent. That is a free weekend for me right now. I kind of, I kind of really
9020780	9024620	want to do it this year. I have, I haven't done it for like fucking 10 years.
9024620	9027340	I talked to Melody about it. Melody has a room.
9028060	9028540	Oh yeah.
9028540	9033260	And I basically were like, you know, I'm going to crash out at some point in your room during
9033260	9037660	the middle of the day. So yeah. We're going.
9037660	9038940	Okay. Good times.
9040300	9040940	At least a day.
9041900	9047900	I don't blame you. All right. Final thoughts time. Before I turn it around for final thoughts,
9047900	9051260	I want to say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was your first
9051260	9056140	episode or your 959th episode, we appreciate you being here. Thank you so much for being in our
9056140	9061100	chat or just listening along with the show on our podcast feed. We appreciate you being here.
9061100	9063980	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend or two,
9063980	9066700	help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9066700	9070380	but we need more voices to put out here on air. Definitely need that.
9071260	9075740	Tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on a
9075740	9080460	site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show, that all goes an awful long way
9080460	9084860	as well. We super appreciate all of that. Okay. With that, let's get final thoughts.
9086220	9089580	DarkSagra. I almost said Loki, but DarkSagra, you're going to go do your stream. So your
9089580	9090060	final thought.
9090780	9095500	I am. I don't know if I'm going to do killer, but if enough people pop in and folks want to play
9095500	9099820	with me, I'd love to open up the lobby and just run a muck in the fog.
9099820	9100780	A muck, a muck, a muck.
9101820	9102940	Yep. A muck.
9102940	9104620	All right. Have fun with a muck.
9105500	9106540	See y'all later, taters.
9106540	9109820	See ya. All right. Loki, your final thought tonight?
9110620	9114220	My final thought is I'm going to be busy. Hopefully you'll see a new episode for me
9114220	9114940	later this week.
9115980	9120940	Awesome. My final thought, two parts. Number one part, I'll be streaming more Stranger
9120940	9124940	of Paradise this week, at least probably until I beat it. I might as well see the game through
9124940	9128780	to completion and I am playing on Bobby. No, I'm not playing on Bobby Black Wolf mode
9128780	9132700	completely because the game can get even easier than where I'm playing it now, but I'm on
9132700	9137020	pretty easy mode to be honest. I'm playing in story mode, but it's good. So I'm hoping
9137020	9140140	to get through that game this week and then probably I'll go back to the Pixel remasters
9140140	9145580	if nothing else. But also I just want to make sure I plug Dragon Con. I know I talk about
9145580	9149420	it a lot. Bobby talks about it a lot, but it is coming up this Labor Day weekend. Alan
9149420	9153660	is going for the first time. He's not going as a guest, sadly, and I think he's a little
9153660	9157580	shy about doing panels that Akani doesn't know very well, but he'll be there. I'll be
9157580	9161820	there and I will certainly be doing panels, whatever they'll give me, as will Bobby.
9161820	9165820	I've heard some early, I can't say anything. Maybe I'm already saying too much. I've
9165820	9172780	heard some early things on what type of panels there might be this year and I'm really
9172780	9176700	excited. That's all I can say. Of course I'm going to say that though, right? But I
9176700	9183420	mean it. I really do. All right. Let's see. I think that's it. It's time to wrap up
9183420	9187020	and get on out of here for the night. Thank you for being here. We'll be back next week,
9187580	9192380	May 14th, with the latest and greatest. I'm sure plenty of your impressions on
9192380	9196700	Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. We're ready to hear them. So enjoy. Happy Zelda Day to those
9196700	9199660	that celebrate. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next week. Bye.
