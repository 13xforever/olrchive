0	30000	What does a KFC Double Down and 70 Dollar Games have in common? Both of them exist because people think they're valuable. The Double Down Cross Diablo 4 shenanigans are rumored to be coming back giving you quote unquote free in-game cosmetics while your IRL1s are staying. The saving grace for me is that my closest KFC closed down in April. I was planning on trying out a Double Down for the first time and giving my coat away to a friend. Oops. This is your greasy finger update.
30000	37000	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell me more about these and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	83080	Hi.
83080	84120	Hi, how are you?
84920	85760	I'm okay.
85780	86280	Yeah.
86280	87360	I'm a little tired.
87480	94560	I was gonna say, I've been reading on social media your increased ballet activity and this working out you're doing to support that.
95280	102320	It doesn't help that some feline in my house named Midna woke me up by smacking wood blinds around.
102360	103080	That's not nice.
103080	107800	But I got up and is armed a gun show.
108960	110800	Hey, now that should be a point redeemed. All right.
111640	113000	It is a redeem in my channel.
113040	114280	Is it? Okay, that's good.
114920	115760	Yeah, no, seriously.
115760	121480	I put it in there for Fixie because Fixie mentioned it, so I put it in there.
121520	123960	We need to think about point redeems here at VOG Network.
123960	131920	We used to do the collection plates for the special streams and technically we still, we still, I know we still owe the listeners a foodie.
131920	136680	I'm sorry, everybody, but you know, the drama that happened there, we'll, we'll, we'll get on scheduling that.
136680	146040	Maybe it can be a thing for our anniversary because believe it or not, I was just looking at the calendar today and we're less than, we're less than a month away from our 21st anniversary.
146200	147800	This show will be old enough to drink.
147960	148560	That's right.
149200	150160	You know what that means, Rob?
150240	150560	What?
150560	151080	You know what that means?
151080	151440	What?
151640	155400	We, we might have to do a drunk show revival.
155440	162160	I, I, I may have a libation or two on the show, but I have to work the next day.
162160	163480	I can't drink like that anymore though.
163480	163840	I know.
163840	164760	I can't.
164920	166400	Yeah, not the way we used to here.
166800	168000	Uh, but maybe.
168000	172560	I mean, just physically, I don't have an actual stomach anymore.
173000	176560	Maybe we can give all of our drinks to the one and only tech master, Loki.
178520	179040	Maybe.
179120	179400	Maybe.
179400	181800	Although I don't think you drink much these days anymore either.
181800	182640	No, not really.
183520	185160	I have to steal Loki's waffles again.
186520	188240	I did eventually buy you waffles.
188520	189560	Those are some good times.
189880	193000	Um, uh, dark to see in chat.
193040	196720	Uh, I'm, I'm curious if you happen to know what episode number that
196720	199760	particular show we keep referencing was, cause I know it's deep within the
199760	206520	archives, um, it was episode number something, uh, I love this comment from
206520	211560	Fixie in our chat or fixation gaze to use the legal name, uh, saying a point
211560	213960	redeem for news stories, like picking a topic.
214160	217440	I love that idea, but to be fair, we, we let people do that for free.
217680	221120	Uh, if you want to submit topic ideas are like a coffee talk.
221160	221480	Yeah.
221480	223400	Our, our discord is always open.
223400	226040	You know, we don't, we don't require the point redeems for that, but I do
226040	230680	love the idea in theory, but then Fixie goes on to say, uh, Oh wow.
230680	233040	This show is only a year-ish older than me.
233520	233880	Okay.
233880	235040	Now, now you can leave.
242040	242680	Thank you.
245120	247240	Thank you, but please stop immediately.
247440	252120	I'm just kidding.
252120	252560	Don't leave.
253440	253880	Mentally.
253880	255160	I haven't aged at all.
256240	257000	I know.
257000	258360	I know it's, it's so funny.
258360	264640	Like I'm, you know, around the time that this show turns 21, uh, I will turn 45.
264800	268680	Uh, so I have a multiple of five birthday coming up, which I guess those are kind
268680	271880	of big deals, I guess, depending on, you know, how you view those types of things.
272360	275200	And you know, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, now that
275200	279920	I'm halfway to 50 in this decade, it's like, do I feel older?
279920	283960	It's like, not really like actually, no, you know what it was?
283960	287920	I wrote this on a blue sky or Twitter or one of those this week.
287960	288200	Okay.
288200	289040	Here's the thing.
289600	292400	So there's a, I'm not going to get into politics too much tonight.
292400	293120	I promise.
293120	299280	However, there is a certain really ugly political candidate who threw their hat in
299280	300880	the ring for president this week.
300960	305080	And if you think about one of the ugliest people you've ever seen on TV, you'll know
305080	306280	exactly who I'm talking about.
306480	309360	Here's the wild orange or is it the other one?
309400	313320	No, they're not orange, but they got married at Disneyland and then never went
313320	314840	again or Disney world, excuse me.
314840	315520	And then never went again.
315520	318640	Apparently, um, that is blasphemous.
318800	322680	Anyhow, I don't want to get into that, but what I do want to get into is that that
322680	326640	guy is like six months younger than me.
328240	330440	Here's the thing I said, thank you.
330480	330800	Thank you.
330800	332520	Like, look, I'm humble.
332840	334640	I try not to have a gigantic ego.
334680	338680	I know people joke about it, but I try to be humble and everything, but I know, I
338680	342240	know I'm way better looking than that guy, but here it is.
342240	342800	Here's my seat.
342800	345240	I'm going to tell you, here's my secret and dark soccer.
345240	346560	I know you share the secret.
346800	350240	Do you know what the secret is to staying young and good looking?
351280	352240	I'll be a deuce bag.
353200	354920	Support trans rights.
355320	356240	That's, that's it.
356280	356560	That's it.
356560	358880	If you support, I thought mine was spite.
358960	362880	No, if you support trans rights, it will keep you young and good looking.
362880	366640	If you don't, then you're going to look like, you know, who?
367800	368240	Her.
369240	371880	That one, that person that shall not be named.
372320	374000	So there it is.
374440	375280	Hushido.
375920	376400	All right.
376440	378360	Except to have a friend named Hushido, so nevermind.
379800	380440	Anyway, all right.
380440	381080	I promise.
382080	384240	I also, I also think spite though, does help.
384320	384680	Yes.
384880	386160	Spite, spite helps a little bit.
386200	392280	Um, anyway, and there's this whole talk on social media about pride month, and
392280	396640	there are certain people on Twitter who are always hating, who took this pride
396640	400720	month and they turned it into a graphic where as it goes down, pride month,
400720	404200	pride month, and then in the bottom, it says demon in rainbow.
404360	408400	And I'm like, they really thought they owned us with that graphic, but never
408400	415160	have I wanted a t-shirt more than the big demon energy that pride month brings us.
415600	416360	I'm going to make it.
416640	417280	Just you wait.
417320	418280	I will make that.
418280	422880	Just be careful because I believe there may actually be a, um, trans artist who's
422880	425360	claiming that they actually came up with that idea first.
425400	430200	So I, but, but take, take a look on social media and find out or put your own twist
430200	430440	on it.
431200	433200	I'll do it in another language.
433440	434520	Ah, there you go.
434680	435040	All right.
435320	435800	That works.
436560	439800	Um, anyway, uh, let's get to the show.
439800	443200	We're going to get to some of those, uh, big announcements from the PlayStation
443200	446560	showcase this week, but first we actually have a special message.
446560	449800	I mentioned, uh, Bobby Black Wolf was not here at the voice of geeks network
449800	454280	tonight because he is currently out in Minneapolis at the summer games done
454280	454760	quick.
454960	458560	I almost wanted to say convention, but it's not really convention.
458560	462880	It's, you know, charity fundraiser that's con adjacent, but the way it was also
462880	467040	explained to me is that it's very much like a cruise, but not floating in the
467040	471920	water because it's, you know, that week of programming that apparently there's
471920	476200	excursions for people wanting to go into downtown Minneapolis and all this stuff.
476200	476720	So, yeah.
476840	480600	So anyway, we have a special video message from the one and only Bobby
480600	484600	Black Wolf, uh, filmed earlier today, live in Minneapolis going to give us a
484600	485760	little look behind the scenes.
485920	486960	Sorry to my cohost.
486960	489600	You're not going to hear this as it plays, but we'll summarize this on the
489600	490120	other side.
490120	493800	So let's turn it over to Bobby Black Wolf at summer games done quick.
494720	496960	Hello, orange launch radio, Bobby Black Wolf here.
496960	497400	Sorry.
497400	498440	I couldn't be there tonight.
498440	498760	Sorry.
498760	504160	I allowed you to actually start on time, but I am at summer games done quick 20,
504160	507600	23 in beautiful downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota.
507920	512680	I am once again, hosting in person, one of the 22 hosts really looking forward
512680	517280	to it, but I wanted to give you a little bit of a taste, a look of what it looks
517280	521880	like here at, uh, it's kind of a convention, but not really, but this week
521880	525120	long event, uh, some of the arcade machines have already gotten in.
525120	527920	There's going to be more arcade machines loaded in today and tomorrow.
528240	531640	Uh, so when, if you tune into my show, the Bobby Black Wolf show next week, you
531640	535560	will see more of what things look like as the week progresses.
535560	537240	They're still kind of in the setup mode.
537240	542320	Now, if you want to catch me on the air, I am going to be working on Monday
542320	548200	morning at around 11 AM Eastern, 8 AM Pacific alien swarm attack on Titan two
548200	550640	and crisis core final fantasy seven reunion.
551000	555640	And then Tuesday night at around 11 PM Eastern 8 PM Pacific, I'm going to be
555640	558400	hosting for silent Hill, home, poor and signal us.
558440	560920	Now you've probably never heard of silent Hill home poor.
560960	563160	You've heard of homecoming and downpour.
563160	565360	Well, silent Hill downpour has.
565800	568880	No skippable cut scenes, unskippable cut scenes.
569240	572880	So they play silent Hill homecoming during the cut scenes of downpour, and
572880	578400	they can actually finish homecoming twice during the unskippable cut scenes of
578400	580320	downpour, so that's going to be a lot of fun.
580680	584160	Uh, so check them out over at games done quick.com or over at
584160	588840	twitch.tv slash games done quick donations, go to doctors without borders.
588880	593720	Uh, so, uh, get, get some donations in if you are able, but if not, at least enjoy
593720	596680	the marathon, I'll let you get back to orange lounge radio now.
598000	598240	All right.
598240	601960	Thank you so much, Bobby black Wolf for that report from Minneapolis where
601960	603640	summer games done quick is going on.
603920	606800	Now I'm actually told, and he did say that I could repeat this.
606960	610240	So when I first saw the video and you could see, I'm sorry to the podcast
610240	613200	listeners, you can't see the visuals, but he was actually showing the arcade there.
613200	616320	And there was lots of great machines there and folks in chat are noticing
617000	617640	that as well.
617800	620920	Uh, the tiger class has the F zero X run in the background.
620920	621280	Oh, I'm sorry.
621280	623360	That's the actual speeder on those playing behind Bobby.
623640	625920	But, um, you could actually see some of those arcade machines.
625920	629560	I saw like a UB there's a DDR machine, but it was really spaced out.
629560	630680	And I was like, wow.
630680	634680	Are they still doing the COVID spacing that they were doing last year?
634720	638320	Even, you know, now I know they are taking still a lot of COVID precautions.
638320	641560	Like everybody in that audience who was not on stage was still masked.
641760	644240	So that's, that's great that they're still, you know, taking those types of
644280	647280	precautions, but I was a little surprised they didn't fill in the room more.
647400	651440	However, what I'm told, and I am allowed to repeat this, apparently there's an
651440	656440	anime convention going on across the street at a convention center and all of
656440	657800	the machines are there.
658080	662960	So as the anime convention finishes, they will then relocate over to summer
662960	663880	games done quick.
663880	667440	So what you saw in the video was really only about a quarter of what they plan
667440	670920	on having there at summer games done quick, but you know, it's not really all
670920	674880	about the arcade there on site because obviously all of us are participating on
674880	678200	the internet and so forth, watching the various speed runs.
678200	681840	I noticed there, we got to see that first Sonic run of the day was being played
681840	684880	there and you could see kind of what that looked like there in studio.
684880	685760	So that was really cool.
685760	687440	So thanks very much.
687440	690240	DJ Rama S says, what anime con?
690240	691160	Anime Minneapolis?
691160	694880	I guess, I don't know, but it's, he said it's at a convention center across the
694880	695280	street.
695280	696160	So yeah.
696520	700440	Dark Tetsuya says, I did spot the theater at the arcade.
700520	701840	Heck yeah, I saw that too.
701840	702480	That's awesome.
703040	707080	As J-100 Matt says, GDQ is a nerd bucket list thing to attend in person.
707240	708960	Yeah, I think it would be a lot of fun as well.
708960	709760	It's kind of a bummer.
709760	712240	They seem to always do it at East Coast sites.
712240	715800	I'd love if there was like a Vegas one or something was a little closer to our side,
715800	717000	but it is what it is.
717000	718640	I'd still love to get to one someday.
718800	721920	Maybe not the whole week, but a few days just to enjoy it.
721920	724280	And you know, cause I know that they apparently still do panels.
724280	725440	I don't know if they're doing them this year.
725440	728400	I would assume they are, you know, some of those types of things as well.
728400	733160	So, but again, you can participate from the comfort of your own home.
733600	737520	You just head on over to their channel over at Games Done Quick.
737600	741840	And again, Bobby will be on the stream doing some announcing tomorrow morning
741840	744360	and Tuesday morning, as he mentioned there in the message.
744360	746080	So break a leg, Bobby Black Wolf.
746400	750400	And if the convention does not break 3 million, then break the other leg as
750400	750720	well.
750720	751400	No, I'm just kidding.
751720	755480	Every dollar raised is incredible for Doctors Without Borders.
755640	756000	All right.
758200	762000	Also, I do want to mention Bobby Black Wolf will be back next week to talk all
762000	767200	about that because Bobby and us here at OLR, we do tape live every Sunday night.
767200	770760	We are at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby
770760	773640	Black Wolf show at eight o'clock Eastern, five o'clock Pacific here at the
773640	776360	Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
776360	777480	That's V-O-G Network.
777480	781520	And of course, you can chat along with us and our show just like folks are in our
781520	782240	chat tonight.
782720	787200	All right, moving on with gaming topics that happened throughout the week, we're
787200	791520	going to get caught up on some of the news we missed last week, but there was a
791520	797560	pretty big bombshell, I guess, drop this week on us, a little bit of a surprise
797560	798440	announcement of sorts.
798440	798760	I don't know.
798760	800440	I thought it was kind of a surprise.
800440	804560	It caught me off guard a little bit, but PlayStation announced one of their state
804560	810040	of play announcements for Thursday, and they actually announced quite a bit of
810040	810480	stuff here.
810480	813680	I'm going to ask Loki to give us the rundown here in just a moment, but I mean,
813680	818440	they even talked about new hardware, kind of, kind of, so we'll talk.
818440	823040	Yeah, yeah, kind of, big, yeah, but we'll talk a little bit about that, but, you
823040	827720	know, that was essentially, I mean, I don't know if that's their E3 replacement
827720	832960	presentation, but it very well could have been, although rumor is on social media,
832960	836760	this is however much you want to invest on social media rumors or not, take it or
836760	839920	leave it, that they are planning another one for later in the summer.
840160	845880	I would assume, I would say it would make sense to see something else July or
845880	851200	August, but this is probably what we're getting in lieu of the early June E3
851200	853720	timeframe announcements, but anything can happen.
853720	854520	Anything's possible.
855280	856080	It's still...
856080	860640	Oh, but how about just, you know, E3 into the sun and rebrand it?
861080	866600	Well, I mean, some would consider Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest is that, and
866600	871520	I would assume Sony will probably drop a couple things at Summer Game Fest as
871520	874320	well, I think, I think that's probably a guarantee.
874320	877400	So there's still more to come, but we got a lot out of this.
877920	880160	Loki, walk us through some of the big announcements here.
880520	884640	Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of big announcements at the, well, it wasn't
884640	886760	really a state of play, it was a PlayStation Showcase.
886840	890640	Oh, excuse me, pick, pick a fucking name and stick with it, y'all.
890640	891480	Pick a name.
891480	895000	Well, it's more of the, the different state of plays are a little bit shorter,
895000	898440	whereas like the Showcase is like a much longer thing.
898440	901040	Like the last time they did one was back in 2021.
902440	903840	So things that they show.
903840	907160	So it was an E3 replacement then, if they're calling it a showcase.
907160	908520	Yeah, yeah, basically.
909680	914280	So they had lots of game trailers and announcements, some brand
914280	915920	new kind of live surface games.
915920	921000	So we had fair game or yes, it's fair games with a dollar sign.
921560	926240	It was, I guess, because punctuation makes everything more hardcore.
926520	929000	Excuse me, hardcore exclamation point.
929640	933560	It's OK. The dollar sign is to represent all the microtransactions, right?
934360	936920	You want to be punctual with your punctuation?
936920	939280	Yeah, I'm sure it's I'm sure the dollar signs just represent
939280	941200	all the microtransactions in the game.
941200	945000	But apparently it's about, I guess, groups of people who are robbing
945440	949200	some sort of corporation or like industrial thing or something like that.
949600	953080	It's just, I don't know, neat, neat looking.
953080	955600	It's going to be coming out on PlayStation five and PC.
956120	958960	We had a was this the game from Jade Raymond Studio?
959280	961960	I think I think that was the other big deal around.
961960	964800	This was this was the Jade Raymond Studio game.
964880	966120	Was it? I don't know.
966120	966920	I believe so.
966920	969440	What studio was it? It was.
970480	972960	Yeah, it is Haven Studios.
972960	976880	Yep. OK, so that's that's the other reason
976880	980600	this is kind of bumped up, because, you know, her influence
980600	982320	has a lot of clout in the industry.
982320	985360	So people are very curious what she's been up to since
986040	987840	she came and went from Stadia.
987840	991240	I don't think she ended up doing anything at Stadia, honestly,
991240	993800	but I don't blame her the way that whole ship sailed.
993800	996520	So, yeah, good for her.
997360	1002800	Sorry, you know, all the Stadia shade is directed at a Mr.
1002800	1004360	Phil Harrison. That's it.
1004360	1008120	Mm hmm. Anyway, bring in the Shadia. Yeah.
1010000	1012120	So what else we had?
1012120	1015360	I think there's some additional shooter games that they had as well.
1016000	1017840	Helldivers two look pretty cool.
1017840	1019280	That's not a shooter, though.
1019280	1021600	That's a top down third person.
1021640	1023680	Well, I guess it's still a third person shooter,
1025280	1028360	but I guess this one is.
1028400	1030960	Yeah, it's going to be a third person shooter, whereas the original was
1030960	1032760	like a top down shooter.
1032760	1033920	So it looks a little bit different.
1033920	1035800	I thought it looked kind of cool, actually.
1035800	1038120	I never played the original.
1038120	1041120	What else? So Ghostrunner two looked pretty awesome.
1041120	1045160	So it took the kind of like wall running and like futuristic cyberpunk
1045560	1047160	swordplay from the original game
1047160	1050240	and added a motorcycle because that is just awesome.
1050400	1053880	You know, I love the idea of riding a motorcycle
1053880	1056760	down a giant like cyberpunk building.
1056760	1058400	And apparently it's something you can do in the game.
1058400	1060320	So looks cool.
1061320	1064520	So it's now a Biden ghost writer.
1066200	1069160	Kind of a little bit, a little, a little bit,
1069160	1073400	a little bit of spirit of vengeance and heads being on fire. Right.
1074160	1076280	What else? So we have it.
1076280	1078280	Immortals of Avium,
1078280	1083680	which is a first person wizard combat game, look kind of neat.
1083720	1088520	Yeah, I have to say, as much as I'm concerned, because this game is an EA game
1088520	1089520	and that means it's going to be,
1089520	1092600	you know, loot box, microtransaction city and all that stuff.
1092600	1096520	I have to say this game gives me big hex and vibes.
1097960	1099640	And I am kind of here for that.
1099640	1101640	Like, I'm going to give EA.
1103200	1103760	We can't hear you.
1103760	1104800	Oh, I'm sorry.
1104800	1106920	I accidentally brushed the mic and muted myself.
1106920	1108520	It's giving me big hex and vibes.
1108520	1111080	So please do not let me down EA.
1111080	1112280	Leaving you speechless.
1112280	1114240	Yeah. Yes, exactly that.
1115360	1118160	Sigh. Can I not have audio problems tonight?
1118200	1120360	I take one week, one week.
1121760	1123560	And it all breaks.
1124040	1126080	Well, it's been Phantom Blade zero.
1126640	1128640	It's a third person action game.
1128800	1132080	That's kind of along the lines of like Ghost of Tsushima.
1132720	1134920	And let's see what else.
1135240	1136000	This one's pretty cool.
1136000	1139280	So there is a game called Sword of the Sea.
1139720	1145080	It's like a it has definitely journey vibes
1145080	1147760	because I guess it's from the former team that did Journey.
1148520	1150840	Pathless and Abzu.
1150840	1154400	And it looks pretty awesome as you like skating on this like hovers
1155400	1157720	surfboard thing over the sands and stuff like that
1158520	1160920	through half pipes and stuff like that, and even have like dolphins
1160920	1161680	flying through the air.
1161680	1163600	So OK, crazy visuals.
1163600	1166840	I definitely see the Journey vibes from this whole thing.
1166840	1169960	So but it's not the same studio, right?
1169960	1174200	It's just some of the same talent that the developers that worked on the game.
1174200	1178400	OK. You know, honestly, that that's a pretty strong resume.
1178400	1179600	That's enough for me to check it out.
1179600	1181480	It does look really pretty.
1181480	1185040	And it's cool because the thing that you're surfing on is your sword.
1185040	1189680	So well, it looks a lot like the Journey scarf, to be honest.
1189720	1192120	There's I feel like there's a lot in common.
1192160	1195240	Wouldn't it be would it be neat if it was like in the same universe or something?
1195240	1198800	I mean, not not that every game has to be like a direct sequel
1198800	1201800	or influence to something else, but it certainly looks similar.
1201800	1205240	I love it when there's like a little tie in at the end, like, you know,
1205840	1209280	spoiler alert, but like at the end of Final Destination 5,
1209280	1212640	they're boarding the flight from the original movie twist.
1213320	1216480	You know, it's just it's it's fun. I don't know, whatever.
1217840	1219480	I haven't seen any of those movies.
1219480	1222400	They're they're disgusting, but I get forced to watch them anyway.
1222400	1225200	I used to watch them all the time, and then they stopped after
1225200	1227120	I don't remember how many sequels.
1227120	1229280	All right. Anyway,
1229320	1232280	the Talos Principle two looks pretty awesome.
1233760	1235120	One that was one of those games.
1235120	1237880	I think I have it in my library, but I need to check it out.
1237880	1241920	But puzzle first person shooter game looks pretty awesome.
1243120	1245640	Niva, which is from the folks that did
1247040	1249360	Gris sequel to Greece, Greece.
1249360	1252360	Yeah. And that's supposed to be coming out next year.
1253000	1254840	I don't know much about this game, Dark Soccer.
1254840	1257160	What what what's Gris?
1257160	1260720	It's a puzzle game where about a girl battling her depression.
1261280	1264160	Oh, wow. I feel like now that you bring that up, I feel like I like
1264520	1267360	saw that, but I don't think I ever played it, but that's OK.
1267800	1270440	But I'm here for the giant antler wolf, so, you know.
1270560	1274040	Of course. I mean, this is the same system that runs The Last Guardian.
1274040	1276320	So, you know, good times.
1276800	1278600	Yeah, it looks very pretty.
1278600	1282440	We had Cat Quest, Pirates of Perobeen.
1282800	1288000	The Perobeen, the get out.
1288000	1290040	It's really called the Perobeen.
1290040	1292600	Yes. So Cat Quest, Pirates of the Perobeen.
1294320	1296360	Why would anyone be surprised?
1296800	1301360	Honestly, go off like if you're going to do it,
1301640	1306600	if you're going to do something like Cat Quest, go big like just do it.
1306600	1308400	I love it. That's like pretty sweet.
1308400	1312760	And then there's this one from Square Enix.
1312760	1316200	It's an it's another live service game from Square Enix.
1317040	1318440	Oh, is it totally going to fail?
1318440	1323360	But so it's a game that people are comparing it to like Splatoon.
1324360	1329080	Yeah, this is just basically Splatoon on the PS5, and I'm totally here for it.
1329080	1331520	I'm sorry. It's called Foam Stars.
1331520	1334320	And you like shoot foam everywhere and do things with foam
1334320	1336120	and all that kind of stuff.
1336160	1338120	And it's got
1338200	1343120	TV anime people in it and not ska music, but that's OK.
1344000	1346920	It's not ink. It's it's foam.
1346920	1349480	It's a dark sakura.
1349680	1352480	That's exactly how the pitch went in my mind.
1355000	1359360	It's one of those foam parties that I guess are big and like, you know.
1359840	1361800	Let's just put it this way, though.
1361800	1364400	Nobody jumps off and, you know, breaks their leg or something.
1364640	1367480	Square Enix has a track record with live service games.
1368120	1370920	That is not good. Yeah, that's that's fair.
1371080	1371760	I will say this.
1371760	1375000	And look, I'm not I'm not here to like say Splatoon is bad or anything.
1375000	1376080	Of course it's not.
1376080	1380880	But how many times have you played a Nintendo title and gone like, man,
1381080	1384840	this would be even better if it like had the PlayStation
1384840	1387360	or Xbox series kind of power behind it.
1387600	1390360	And now that's kind of like what they're doing with this.
1390360	1393960	But yes, there's there's every right to be concerned
1393960	1397720	that there's going to be, you know, microtransaction hell
1397720	1402600	or it's going to be a little bit, you know, wonkier than, you know, Splatoon.
1402840	1406560	You know, Nintendo does put a lot of time into the quality of their games
1406560	1408360	and there's something to be said about that.
1408360	1411200	So totally, totally fair, to be honest.
1411400	1413760	But I'm sure I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.
1414800	1418240	There was a whole period in the NES era when Tengen did it better.
1418520	1420720	Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
1421000	1424520	I like how they go from like the CG part of the trailer to the gameplay,
1424520	1428640	and you're like, oh, it's like massively like
1429440	1432840	not as good as the CG part.
1432840	1436680	It's like, oh, this just looks pretty plain.
1437720	1442400	SSJ 100 Matt says this is like vanilla ice trying to say that ice ice baby
1442400	1444200	is different from under pressure.
1444200	1446640	Yeah, exactly. Exactly right.
1446640	1449280	More than 50% change.
1449280	1453640	Pirate Pound Town says get clean by playing dirty.
1454480	1457440	Orange Wright suggests the name bubble bath battlers.
1458040	1459680	Wait, that might be a bad name.
1459680	1462240	Yeah, don't don't call your game bubble bath babes
1462240	1465600	because people will think it's a completely different game from the NES era.
1466080	1469000	You can Google that, but it's NSFW just leaving that out there.
1470280	1473720	Anyhow. Yeah, it looks interesting.
1473920	1476080	I don't know. Neat.
1477080	1480160	We've got another trailer trailer for the plucky squire,
1480680	1485800	and it's a that RPG game that takes place like books.
1485800	1489360	And then you kind of kind of has a was it the
1491160	1495280	was it that gameplay element from the Legend of Zelda
1495960	1501160	in between worlds where you kind of like kind of go squish to like flat.
1501160	1503280	And so you're yeah, you go to D.
1503280	1504760	So kind of like that, I guess.
1504800	1506840	Mario Odyssey is similar.
1506840	1508080	Looks pretty sweet.
1508080	1510280	Console version of Teardown is coming.
1510280	1511440	That game is pretty awesome.
1511440	1514120	It's kind of a voxel heist game
1514400	1518080	and very, very cool because it's all physics based.
1518080	1521880	You can destroy buildings and all sorts of crazy stuff.
1521880	1524200	So cool that that's coming to consoles.
1525200	1530960	The rumored Metal Gear Solid three Snake Eater remake is a thing now,
1530960	1533560	and it's coming to the PlayStation five.
1533560	1535680	I think maybe even other platforms as well.
1537840	1542080	No word on when that's coming, but it is something that is in development.
1542720	1544360	I mean, yeah, that is neat.
1544360	1546200	I'm not not mad at that at all.
1546200	1550920	But is it a little weird that it's three and not one or two?
1551400	1556040	Like, wouldn't you want to do it was one of the best in the series, I guess.
1556040	1560320	Yeah. And I guess to be fair, like Silent Hill two is getting a remake.
1560320	1561560	So maybe it's just one of those.
1561600	1565400	They're remaking some of the PlayStation two era actually wasn't.
1565640	1569440	I can't remember. Was Metal Gear Solid three a PS two game or a PS three game?
1569520	1571080	This is a PS two game, wasn't it?
1571080	1574160	So then maybe they're maybe they're remaking the PS two era games
1574160	1577280	for whatever reason, had the most epic song.
1577320	1579520	The song better be intact.
1580160	1583320	It's in the trailer, so I'm assuming it's good. Good.
1584240	1587000	Good, good. Because sometimes you feed on a tree fog
1588160	1591400	because they they they, of course, after like teasing everything
1591400	1594080	because they don't really show you what what the trailer is for.
1594080	1596520	Initially, it's just a bunch of animals and stuff.
1596520	1599120	And then you see snake and then the music comes in.
1599120	1601720	It's like, yeah.
1601720	1604200	A couple of comments in chat on some of these things we're talking about,
1604200	1606200	but some really good feedback here in chat.
1606200	1609720	Tiger Claus pointing out Sony's copied Nintendo several times.
1609720	1613360	Remember PlayStation All Stars, which is a clone of Smash Brothers?
1613640	1617600	Yeah. And sadly, it wasn't quite as good, but that's not to say it was bad.
1617600	1619080	That game definitely had their fans.
1619080	1621040	And there's a lot of people they did with it.
1621080	1623800	A lot of people would love to see another one of those games, to be quite honest.
1623800	1627320	So I like how it like it combined like the backgrounds combined
1627320	1630640	like two different games together and they kind of like
1630640	1632840	there is stuff that went along with that.
1632840	1634600	So I think that was pretty sweet.
1634600	1638320	And I wish like we would get that a little bit more with like Smash Brothers
1638320	1642120	where instead of having like, say, a Kirby level,
1642120	1645320	you could have a Kirby level and then like Zelda stuff,
1645320	1649360	like kind of mashing together almost like in the stuff interacting.
1649360	1650920	It'd be really cool.
1652120	1653560	Fixation Gaze in chat says,
1653560	1657160	Does Sony not have their own ideas or do they need to copy others homework?
1657720	1659960	To be fair, I mean, I get I totally get that perspective.
1659960	1661600	It's Square Enix. That is true.
1661600	1662440	It's a Square Enix game.
1662440	1665520	But and certainly Square Enix has plenty of their own ideas,
1665520	1667960	even though, you know, they've made one game 16 times.
1667960	1668960	But they are all different.
1668960	1671160	They seem completely original.
1671160	1677040	Yeah. But also, you know, Sony is, you know, God of War and Last of Us.
1677040	1680760	They do they have the bandwidth to be able to do their own stuff, too.
1680760	1683080	But that is a good point that technically it's Square Enix
1683080	1685200	that's bringing it to Sony.
1685200	1687080	Yeah. And they all you know what?
1687080	1689320	You know what? If you think about sorry, I don't mean to cut you off.
1689320	1692880	But if you think about what Splatoon was anyway,
1692880	1695520	I mean, Splatoon was kind of a derivative idea.
1695840	1699240	If you think about it, it's just that it was the very Nintendo cutesy
1699240	1702880	way of doing a shooter and doing, you know, one of those more competitive
1702880	1703920	types of games.
1703920	1707440	And, you know, so was Splatoon itself a really original idea?
1707680	1708880	Eh, not really.
1708880	1712040	But Nintendo has their way of putting their own polish on everything.
1712040	1714840	So, you know, there's a lot of video games that are derivative
1714840	1717600	of something else, but they perfect the formula.
1717600	1718920	They make it better. Right.
1718920	1722520	So you can tell when you get your hands on the game.
1722720	1724920	I think that's, you know, obviously going to be the key.
1724920	1729400	Is this just a rip off or is this, you know, oh, it's an evolution,
1729520	1732160	because I would say there's a big difference between those two types of games,
1732160	1733320	an evolution and a rip off.
1734920	1739840	Anyhow, we had a game show called Towers of Gospa,
1740240	1743560	and it looks pretty sweet, pretty epic, kind of reminds me a bit
1743560	1747440	of Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, at least with the verticality to it.
1747760	1749520	They show these giant,
1750040	1753800	I guess they're like salmon or catfish or something like that,
1753800	1757120	giant flying catfish that you can actually land on
1757120	1760280	and collect things from and stuff like that and fighting monsters.
1760280	1762840	So kind of a little Monster Hunter vibe to it as well.
1763480	1765080	That looks pretty sweet.
1765640	1767760	We had another trailer for Final Fantasy 16.
1769040	1770920	So, you know.
1771720	1775560	Cool. I actually I purposely think all the characters
1775560	1778160	just look the same after a while.
1778160	1782600	I purposely did not watch the 16 trailer because I'm
1782600	1784600	I don't want to oversaturate at this point.
1784600	1789040	I want to just wait for the game to come out and play it.
1790040	1793240	I just have a hard time watching them now, just because I mean,
1793600	1798120	seriously, their characters have no variation between modern iterations now.
1798240	1802560	Yeah. Like, oh, all the all the the dark haired women look like Tifa.
1803320	1806080	Like, seriously, it's just they
1807640	1810040	their style isn't exciting anymore.
1810840	1812760	It's pretty.
1812760	1816520	Well, they're just not as like memorable like I think like Noctis or whatever.
1816520	1821640	I'm not really enthralled with the group from like 15 even.
1822880	1825960	Well, and you can even go back to like something like Final Fantasy 12,
1825960	1828520	where pretty much every character in that game was forgettable,
1828520	1830400	except for Balthier and Fran.
1830400	1833200	When you talk about Final Fantasy 12, that's all anybody wants to talk about.
1833680	1836880	And I'm sure somebody out there in chat is like, but I love Piniello,
1836880	1841720	but realize that most people could give a shit about any of the characters
1841720	1846160	in those games besides Balthier and Fran, who were the stars of that game.
1846680	1849320	Period. Well, I'll also say this.
1849320	1852480	I tried to play the game and got really bored with it. So.
1853400	1858720	Yeah, I don't think I've had fun in a Final Fantasy game since like.
1860800	1862400	Part of eight.
1862760	1865040	And of course, the MMOs.
1865440	1868600	Yeah, and I'm going sequentially because I still think
1868600	1871120	that Final Fantasy five is like the best of them.
1872040	1874680	Yeah, and I you know, again, I didn't hate 15,
1874680	1877200	but there was a lot of room for improvement in 15.
1877200	1882480	And I just it was not near 15 was not as good as 13 to me.
1882840	1885760	10 and 10 to got. Yeah, I could.
1885760	1889480	I borrowed your copy of 13, the first one, and I got kind of bored.
1890920	1892640	It is lightning needed personality.
1892640	1898360	It it I it's a fair criticism that Final Fantasy 13 takes 20 hours to get going.
1898880	1903600	It's a completely fair criticism, but I also kind of see to me
1903640	1907360	like there's certain TV shows that are the same way.
1907680	1910000	It's until it's not until the end of the first season
1910000	1912200	where things finally start to fucking escalate.
1912360	1914000	And that's how Final Fantasy 13 was.
1914000	1916520	And I think that's that's what kind of broke the deal for a lot of people.
1916520	1918440	And I get it. So.
1918440	1921880	But I'm still I'm so excited for the lightning to actually be worthy
1921880	1922960	of being a main character.
1922960	1925600	And I know I should have played more and I know she got better.
1925720	1929960	Yeah, but you know, but she she also gets upstaged by some of the supporting cast.
1929960	1931240	Like once you get Fang,
1931240	1934400	Fang is a incredible character that I sort of wish was explored
1934400	1935360	more in the follow ups.
1935360	1940200	She's there, but not nearly as much so because of things that happen in 13
1940200	1943160	dodging spoilers of a very old game. All right.
1944880	1946760	Anyhow, sorry, Loki.
1946760	1947640	That's right.
1947640	1952120	We had a game game play trailer for Alan Wake two, which looks pretty awesome.
1952120	1954440	And that's how we have October 17th.
1957120	1960440	They announced the next Assassin's Creed game,
1960440	1964280	so we have Assassin's Creed Mirage making the full transition
1964280	1966560	right back to Prince of Persia again. So
1968200	1969440	it looks interesting.
1969440	1970680	I'm OK with that.
1972480	1975720	Revenant Hill, which is looking forward to this.
1976120	1980040	Yeah, I guess it's a game developed by Glory Society
1980600	1983520	where you play a cat named Twigs.
1984440	1987040	Who is a trying to become a witch's familiar.
1988760	1990320	That sounds fun.
1990320	1992400	Yeah, it's pretty fun looking.
1992400	1994040	I like the art style in it.
1994040	1996080	It gives me kind of limbo vibes, but.
1998000	2000440	With a little more with a little splash of color to it.
2001640	2005440	Yes, I know cat games have been doing very well for Sony,
2005440	2007920	like everybody lost their fucking mind about Stray.
2008120	2011040	And now what? Now we get a cat quest sequel,
2011040	2012760	although that game was everywhere, to be fair.
2012760	2015960	And you know, now this cat games are going to be all the rage.
2015960	2018840	And I better not hear a single damn one of you complaining about it
2018880	2021680	because this is this is a great thing for games.
2022600	2025080	And that's on period.
2025080	2027800	There's a trailer for Grand Blue Fantasy Relink,
2027920	2030800	which is out this winter,
2031000	2036440	and it is the next entry into the Grand Blue Fantasy series, I guess.
2036840	2039440	So cool looking JRPG there.
2040800	2044840	Street Fighter six had a new trailer and.
2045760	2047960	That game is out this week.
2048000	2053120	There are there are two heavy, heavy hitters for the year out this week.
2053400	2055640	Diablo for Street Fighter six.
2055640	2060000	This is this is a big week for games, you know, going into what would have been
2060000	2063120	E3 week, essentially the week after, well, maybe two weeks.
2063400	2066680	But still, it's summer is here, that's for sure.
2066880	2068480	But yeah, Street Fighter six looks awesome.
2068480	2073080	Like if I didn't know that, like all of my time would be spent on Diablo
2073080	2075920	until Final Fantasy 16 is out and then all my time will be spent on that.
2076080	2077880	I would get Street Fighter six right away.
2077880	2082200	But as it stands, I'm like, maybe if I can write it out till Black Friday,
2082200	2084160	I'll get it on a sale.
2084160	2086200	I know we're interested in it, to be honest.
2086200	2090480	I kind of only want to play Street Fighter six because of the little like
2091280	2093880	single player, like story mode or whatever,
2093880	2098600	because it reminds me a lot of like kind of the demo was great.
2099320	2102640	Yeah. Like was it the like a dragon stuff?
2102680	2105640	Oh, yeah. Like kind of weird.
2105800	2108040	It does have a bit of that. Yeah.
2108800	2111800	So I'm kind of wanting to check it out because of that.
2111800	2113160	I'll catch it on sale, probably.
2113160	2115640	But yeah, it looks interesting.
2116640	2118720	We had a game called Ultros.
2119200	2121600	Not really the final fans. So good.
2121600	2125800	But it's like a kind of a they compared to like a like a black like
2126800	2129520	1960s concert poster come to life.
2129520	2132200	It looks like it's very like this is why Dark Soccer likes it.
2132200	2133120	It looks like pinball.
2133160	2136000	It looks like a pinball, well, not the game, but the artwork on a pinball machine.
2136000	2138680	It looks like a 60s pinball.
2138680	2139760	But that's not.
2139760	2142640	But I'm leaning more toward like those
2143600	2147200	late 60s, early to mid 70s psychedelic posters.
2147200	2149920	And those are just like.
2149920	2153760	The colors are vibrant and they're garish,
2153760	2156480	but they work well in that style.
2156480	2160960	So I really just dig the inspiration behind it.
2160960	2161760	And it's really good.
2161760	2164160	I mean, we're not sick of Metroidvanias yet, right?
2164160	2166800	We're down for another one in the, you know, actually.
2166800	2168760	Eliminate the term.
2168760	2171120	Eliminate the term Metroidvania.
2171120	2174160	Yeah, I mean, it's a platformer.
2174160	2176080	End of story is exploratory platformer.
2176080	2177760	Action platformer.
2177760	2180160	A plant former?
2180160	2182120	No, I said an action platformer.
2182120	2183960	I thought you said platformer
2183960	2187200	based on the art, and I was going to laugh, but I guess I shouldn't.
2187440	2190400	No, action platformer or like,
2190440	2194400	I don't know, like games like that have existed for well before.
2194680	2197640	Yeah. Symphony of the night.
2197640	2200040	Yeah. Before Metroid they existed.
2201000	2204120	I mean, I guess in some ways, adventure on the 2600
2204120	2204880	was kind of like that.
2204880	2208280	So anyway, Dragon's Dogma 2.
2208840	2214080	So that's Capcom's action RPG game finally coming out.
2214080	2216680	The sequel at least played some of the first one.
2216960	2218560	It was all right.
2219240	2222840	Yeah, I think that was one of those games that had the DLC on disk,
2222840	2224920	if I remember correctly, way back in the day.
2224920	2229440	Not a problem anymore, because, you know, I just played it on Mac on my
2229680	2231640	well, at the time on my PC.
2231640	2233640	Yeah, they released that game everywhere.
2233640	2236040	So but it definitely has its fans.
2236040	2238440	So I know this is getting some people excited.
2238440	2240760	I like some of the character design looks looks neat.
2241760	2244160	They showed off more stuff for PlayStation VR, too.
2244160	2247600	So a few things. Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted Two
2247840	2250560	is going to be coming to the console as well.
2250760	2254080	Resident Evil 4 VR mode had a trailer for that.
2254600	2259440	Arizona Sunshine Two, which is coming out this spring on PlayStation VR
2259440	2263640	two and PC. Crossfire Sierra Squad,
2264280	2266920	which is going to be like a PlayStation two
2267000	2269480	or PlayStation VR two version of the game,
2270920	2272560	which that looks kind of cool.
2272560	2275160	Synapse, which we saw a trailer for this before.
2275320	2276600	I don't remember where exactly,
2276600	2279560	but this is going to be coming out
2279560	2282560	actually July 4th. Looks pretty cool.
2283120	2284520	It looks like a really neat game.
2284520	2286600	I just wish it wasn't directly first person.
2286640	2289240	Let me just jump in real quick on Five Nights at Freddy's,
2289240	2291440	because there's a great comment from Tiger Claw in chat.
2292000	2294280	Five Nights at Freddy's fans are eating good this week.
2294280	2297320	A teaser trailer for the movie adaptation got released.
2297320	2299640	It sure did. That looked pretty good.
2299960	2303760	So then the next day, a trailer for the ruined DLC for Security
2303760	2306840	Breach was released, then out of left field here in the PlayStation.
2306840	2309560	So you get a sequel to the VR game help wanted to
2310160	2311920	assumeably about the sister location.
2311920	2314720	So, yeah, it was it was a good week to be a Freddy fan, that's for sure.
2317920	2320360	Beat Saber's coming to PlayStation VR two,
2320360	2323760	which I honestly thought it already was, but they're going to be also
2323760	2326400	throwing in a queen themed music pack,
2326760	2329760	which I hope is available on all platforms because, you know,
2330080	2333440	the trailers don't don't stop me now. Yeah.
2334440	2338280	And I was also surprised Beat Saber wasn't already on PSVR two.
2338280	2340320	I think it had been announced, but I think
2341560	2344920	I think now it's it's just it's out now, basically.
2344960	2347920	So by the way, if you bought the original on PS4,
2347920	2350160	you can download the new one for free. That was kind of cool.
2350400	2353880	I saw except I don't have a PSVR two, so it does me no good.
2354160	2357520	But yeah, that's that's probably the whole thing.
2357520	2361760	Sony wants me to get one now that I already have a game available to play on it.
2362760	2365880	But here's the thing, like with the PlayStation VR stuff,
2365880	2370000	like Sony still didn't show any first party PlayStation VR game. Yeah.
2370400	2371760	It's like third party stuff.
2371760	2374480	And a lot of this stuff is just like.
2374480	2376240	Cool, Beat Saber.
2376240	2377480	That's not system seller.
2377480	2381680	That's on everything like, you know, cool Arizona sunshine.
2381680	2385160	I mean, that's also on like most VR platforms.
2385360	2388480	I would agree that this was good
2388520	2391720	and Sony needed to show some VR stuff
2391720	2395320	to show that they're sustaining PSVR two.
2395320	2396640	But you're absolutely right.
2396640	2398320	We need something first party.
2398320	2401840	And quite frankly, PSVR two needs its half life, Alex.
2402720	2406120	Like it needs a game of like that caliber that is exclusive
2406120	2409520	to the platform to really, I think, woo more people there.
2409520	2410720	I just don't think that's there yet.
2410720	2414480	I know they're saying the sales figures, but I can't help
2414480	2416800	but feel like some things are getting twisted to make that work.
2417240	2418840	Or maybe it's selling better in other countries.
2418840	2422240	I don't know. But I again,
2422240	2426160	I just don't feel like the catalog is really there yet.
2426680	2429600	But maybe there'll be a surprise for the holidays. Who knows?
2431800	2434320	Yeah. And then talk about out of nowhere.
2434320	2438520	So Bungie announced that they're making a new marathon game.
2440360	2443680	That looked really stylish and cool, to be honest.
2443680	2447520	It also looks like it has nothing to do with the original.
2451400	2454680	You have some sort of combo running man battle royale.
2454920	2459000	Yeah. But I'm, you know, I'm curious.
2459000	2462080	That's that's a pretty big thing to revive your oldest IP,
2462080	2463320	basically, and bring it back.
2463320	2465560	I think that's very interesting.
2465560	2469480	But I figure this game is probably still like at least two years away, probably.
2469480	2472520	So nothing to get excited about in the near term.
2474400	2478320	Destiny two, the final shape is going to be the next
2478320	2482400	and apparently last big expansion for the game.
2482960	2486800	So looking forward to those Destiny three trailers next year, I guess.
2488360	2491080	So that's going to be a thing that's coming out.
2491080	2496160	Concord, which is a game by Firewalk Studios.
2496680	2499520	And I don't know.
2499520	2501920	It looks somewhat interesting.
2503680	2506560	Not really sure about it because they don't really show too much of it.
2507440	2508000	Sorry, some audio.
2508000	2510480	I just see that whole part with them launching out
2510480	2512680	and it makes me think they've gone to plaid.
2514200	2517240	I like the like logo treatment that they did there.
2517480	2520240	But yeah, twenty twenty four.
2520240	2522840	So cool.
2522840	2525280	And then we get to some strange things.
2525280	2531640	So Project Q, which is Sony's answer to it's not really streaming.
2532520	2536000	So are like it's not like this competing against the steam deck,
2536000	2540360	but sort of kind of is it is a handheld device that's
2541320	2545840	based off of streaming games from your PlayStation console via remote play.
2547880	2552720	Which. I don't.
2553840	2558120	It's not the PlayStation switch, though, it's basically just like it's like
2559120	2561000	you can do this on your phone already.
2561040	2565320	In fact, we even sell like peripherals play that to do this.
2565320	2567920	But like, I don't know, it just looks ugly.
2567920	2569640	It looks weird.
2569640	2571440	I don't like it. I don't like it.
2571440	2576120	Jamie, I don't like PlayStation five earbuds.
2576520	2581520	I, I actually I'm not quite as negative as you're feeling, Loki.
2581520	2584960	I, I understand why something like this exists,
2585360	2588240	especially in those households where
2588560	2593120	mom or dad wants to use the TV to watch whatever.
2593360	2596200	And so you can play your game on this.
2596200	2599760	I would say this is Sony's version of the Wii U in a way.
2601480	2602760	It's the play deck.
2602760	2603520	Yeah. Or that. Yeah.
2603520	2606520	I mean, yeah, the steam deck, you know, play deck or whatever you want to say.
2606520	2608880	I think in a way it's that.
2608880	2610960	I think there could be something to say here.
2610960	2614840	Like, I think it could be very cool to do the whole like,
2614920	2619280	I'm going to tap into my PlayStation five while I'm in another city.
2619800	2622760	So like, for example, I was on San Diego for a work trip last week.
2622760	2623880	That's why I wasn't here on the show.
2624440	2626880	That would have been neat to have a device like this,
2627240	2631040	that I could tap into my PlayStation five. Although Loki, you're fair,
2631040	2631520	what you said,
2631520	2633880	you can already do this on your mobile phone if you just have the right little
2633880	2637600	clip for it. So, you know, but taking that a step.
2637600	2638960	You can be able to do that with Stadia.
2639120	2642640	Yeah. Yeah. Right. Taking this a step further and doing this sort of thing,
2642640	2645240	but it's not even cloud.
2645240	2649200	It's your PlayStation five that you're able to tap into on the internet.
2649600	2652640	Can you do it from a distance or do you have to be on the same network for that?
2652640	2657000	Because I remember that they have, you know, remote play.
2657000	2660600	When they talk about remote play, my expectation is that it's over the internet,
2660600	2663480	but I guess I could be wrong. If it's not over the internet,
2663480	2667320	then I forget what I'm saying here. I don't see the point of this device then.
2667640	2671560	But if it does it over the internet, then I think, you know, especially again,
2671560	2674160	as 5g gains more popularity,
2675080	2678320	there's going to be a space for this. But my concern is,
2678320	2681960	as Sony does this a lot, if they release it too early,
2682840	2685560	I'm not sure it's going to sell a ton right out the gate,
2685560	2688760	and then they're going to give up on it before it could reach its prime.
2689680	2693360	Yeah, it says you can use PlayStation remote play.
2693360	2696560	It says when connected to broadband network or mobile data.
2696560	2698640	So it says you can do it.
2698640	2701760	My question is, like, if you're going to buy a console for remote play,
2701760	2705360	I mean, just buy a Steam Deck because it's compatible with PC.
2705960	2708800	You could probably play this on a Steam Deck already.
2709080	2713920	Why would I want to buy a device that only works with the PlayStation five?
2714480	2719000	And is I mean, we don't even know how expensive it is yet. So.
2720120	2723160	It's probably at least a few hundred dollars, so why bother?
2723160	2723920	Like, I don't know.
2723920	2727440	It's yeah, it's got to be priced competitively with a Steam Deck for sure.
2728320	2731680	The consoles just haven't had much interesting if it's
2731920	2734120	unless it's the switch is just.
2735960	2738640	I almost think they're trying too hard with this one.
2738640	2741240	They're seeing, oh, everyone else has had success with this.
2741240	2743200	Why don't we try it too late?
2743960	2746160	The one thing I will say is that, you know, remember,
2746160	2749720	you can also do other things with your PlayStation in the multimedia world.
2749720	2751960	But to be fair, it's nothing you can't do with your phone
2752080	2755200	when it comes to things like streaming services and, you know, movies
2755200	2757840	and things like that, it's nothing you can't already do with your phone.
2758240	2759960	I I don't know.
2759960	2763480	I think this could be interesting, but not not if it's too expensive.
2764000	2766320	So, yeah, we need more details on this for sure.
2766320	2769040	I wish I wish PlayStation would just do another dedicated handheld,
2769040	2771200	but I get why they're hesitant to.
2773080	2778240	Yeah. And then finally, we got a new trailer for Marvel's Spider-Man two,
2778440	2783280	which is obviously a big game from Insomniac and one of the things that
2784280	2788000	Sony is very proud to show off for the PlayStation five.
2788000	2790040	Well, it's the holiday tent pole, basically.
2790040	2792200	So this is, you know, the biggest game, basically,
2792520	2795920	at least for as far as Sony sees it for the for the fall.
2796120	2798040	So I get it. Yeah.
2798040	2801560	And they show off Peter using, I guess, the dark venom suit,
2801560	2806960	as well as we see Miles Morales and some of his abilities as well.
2807360	2809640	So come out this fall. Awesome.
2810520	2811400	All right.
2811400	2813640	So PlayStation Showcase, very busy.
2813760	2815800	I mean, if you think about it, that was a lot.
2816160	2819280	That was like that was like 20 titles you just went over.
2819280	2822680	So there's there's a lot going on here.
2822680	2824920	So it's going to be an interesting year for Sony.
2824920	2825840	And it's going to be interesting
2825840	2829800	to see what Microsoft has ready to go in response in a couple of weeks.
2830640	2832280	And maybe Nintendo.
2832280	2834920	I mean, Nintendo is definitely the wild card in the room right now
2834920	2837560	because we we literally do not know what happens now.
2837800	2842040	You know, Zelda, of course, still has many people's attention. I get it.
2842280	2844800	But what comes in six months? We don't know.
2844800	2846920	So there's kind of an expectation there.
2846920	2850400	Nintendo is going to tell us soon what's next. What's after Zelda?
2851080	2854560	So I can't wait until we actually sit down with it,
2854560	2857360	because I've seen all kinds of fun things that people made.
2857800	2861000	Someone has officially made a yacht.
2861000	2864200	I like somebody did like a death trap type of thing
2864200	2866400	that they were putting the mobs in, like a cage.
2866600	2868040	They would slam down on the mobs.
2868040	2870840	It would just like electrocute them over. And I thought it was very funny.
2871000	2874880	Oh, I saw this awesome one where someone had flamethrowers
2874880	2876600	that went out in a circle.
2876600	2880280	And so once everything was lit up, they'd, you know, use the updraft
2880280	2884960	to to rise up above everything and then watch from above
2885360	2888840	while it just burned all of the enemies to bits.
2888880	2890360	It was it was great.
2890360	2892680	And then, of course, there was the the piss man.
2893680	2895560	Who had a fire hydrant for.
2895560	2897600	Yes, yes, yes.
2897600	2898920	We saw him already.
2898920	2903400	People, people were making like like at at type thing,
2903720	2907360	you know, like walking platforms with the
2907600	2912440	with the wheels as the mechanisms for the legs.
2912440	2915000	It was there's some really creative people out there,
2915000	2917720	and it just requires a simple understanding of basic physics.
2917720	2922920	Mm hmm. And I I'm I'm looking forward to trying to make a Gundam.
2926080	2927840	All right. I think I've seen that.
2927840	2930680	I the more and more I see people make these clever things,
2930680	2932480	the more I feel like I want to get the game.
2932480	2936040	But, you know, again, it's going to be a busy summer, so we'll see.
2936720	2939640	I'll find you one of the collections I saw. It was very impressive. Nice.
2940040	2945040	All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games
2945080	2948000	we have been playing this week, Zelda or otherwise.
2948240	2950360	So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you. How is your gaming week?
2951160	2953760	Two weeks worth of gaming, Rob.
2953760	2955600	Yeah, sure. Two weeks if you want.
2955600	2958520	Yeah. So I went to
2960240	2962960	Golden State Pinball Festival last weekend.
2965120	2967960	So they had a lot of really good ones,
2967960	2973320	including the the 007 anniversary limited edition.
2973560	2974880	And I'm going to tell you this right now.
2974880	2976000	It's not worth money.
2976000	2981040	It was not as fun as the the classic bond tables
2981040	2984800	that they have out there in the style of the the classic ones.
2984800	2986120	You kind of like what they did with Beatles.
2986120	2989800	Mm hmm. They're they're themed after different movies.
2989800	2992720	There was a Dr.
2992720	2995800	No was one of them, and that's the one that that I played.
2996880	2997920	I played the data.
2997920	2999600	I played every Star Wars that was there.
2999600	3001800	So I played a Data East one.
3002120	3005240	I played the stern and I played the Sega one.
3007160	3010120	They had the Foo Fighters table done by Jack Danger,
3012000	3016120	and they had the L.E., the limited edition, and they had the the pro.
3016440	3019520	And honestly, I think I liked the pro better than the limited edition.
3019520	3022480	I mean, having the multiple layers of it was great.
3022680	3024520	You couldn't freaking hear the music in there,
3024520	3027880	but I got to play in the tournament room when they were starting to pack up.
3028200	3030000	And the music was great.
3030000	3032040	The music selection is fantastic.
3032360	3035480	And the art in it is hilarious.
3035640	3039520	It's kind of got like the sort of semi Scooby Doo vibe of them
3039520	3040800	and their van and everything.
3042480	3045920	And then as far as oh, and I ran into Amanda.
3046880	3049240	I know. Thanks for the pick. Yeah. Yeah.
3049520	3051000	So they had a pin bot there.
3051000	3053480	They still put googly eyes on it, and it was hilarious.
3055080	3057840	I played Shaq Attack.
3058160	3060600	That is I've never gotten to play one.
3060600	3062360	It's a weird it's one of the gauntlet games.
3062360	3064360	So, you know, there's a really hit and miss.
3064360	3066760	It has this like whole mechanic where you go,
3066760	3070880	you shoot the pinball up a ramp to land in the net.
3071080	3073840	It's like this big plastic dome over it to protect the glass.
3073840	3077200	It's kind of kind of ingenious.
3077200	3080160	They had Galactic Tank Force, which is.
3083120	3085400	It's not a Jersey Jack, I think, or it might be.
3086000	3090120	Um, I'd have to look it up again, but it's it's cheese ball.
3090120	3091960	It's got full motion video.
3091960	3095560	It makes me think of like an old Sega CD game
3096320	3098400	with with the little cinematics on there.
3098400	3102160	I got way too distracted actually watching the the animated bits.
3103480	3106560	They someone had reskinned an old,
3106800	3109320	you know, classic table to The Walking Dead.
3110200	3111480	And that was pretty fun.
3111480	3112640	I played Mr.
3112640	3117560	and Ms. Pac-Man, which is a very, very, very weird table.
3118480	3119640	There was no baby Pac-Man.
3119640	3121040	I was quite sad.
3121760	3126840	I played Ultraman and Ultraman is actually identical table to Halloween.
3127520	3129760	So I enjoyed them.
3129760	3131840	There's people who are like, it's kind of boring.
3131840	3133360	I thought it was just fine.
3133360	3134960	I thought it was fun.
3134960	3136720	I played a junkyard.
3136720	3140280	I played this bell ringer thing.
3140280	3142720	We set some stuff on fire.
3142720	3144720	Oh, total nuclear annihilation.
3145520	3146520	Best soundtrack.
3146520	3149920	It is on Apple Music, Spotify, all of the things.
3150280	3151440	Absolutely get it.
3151440	3153920	It's such good.
3153920	3156920	Retro new wave if you if you like the style.
3157360	3160360	And it's it's just such a good table.
3160360	3162880	I super love it.
3164320	3168440	There was also they had a joust tabletop.
3169440	3174920	I play OK, so here was my disappointment of the show, and that was Scooby Doo.
3175920	3178640	I mean, it was all the new voices, which I mean,
3179680	3184280	some of them are OK, but it just wasn't very fun.
3184320	3189240	So, OK, so you know how Black Knight 2000 has the double playfield, right?
3189280	3192080	Right. And you have to do the loop and then shoot the top.
3192600	3197000	This is almost built like Black Knight 2000.
3197040	3201840	But it's so slow and the voices are annoying
3202080	3207000	and the sound effects are annoying and it just and the flippers,
3207000	3211040	I don't think are a standard with the part and a little bit off center.
3211520	3215240	So it just was not fun to me at all at all.
3216400	3220240	Although I have to say the aesthetics of the table were were spot on.
3220440	3221440	Absolutely spot on.
3222840	3225760	And I said I played Halloween, which I took a lot of pictures of it
3225760	3229400	just because I thought the touches in the Halloween one are so good.
3231200	3232160	I also
3234120	3236320	I played a bunch of Foo Fighters, actually.
3236320	3238560	I just had so much fun with Foo Fighters.
3240520	3242440	I played yeah, there's there I'm
3242440	3246640	actually looking at my photo library so I can see I played the Mandalorian again.
3248000	3250240	I played X-Men.
3250240	3250880	I played a bunch.
3250880	3254840	I just I played the Evil Knievel table when we were talking about,
3254840	3256280	you know, racing and stunts.
3256280	3258000	And I'm I'm sure the listeners understand
3258000	3260560	you played a lot of pinball at the expo, for sure.
3260840	3261760	Yeah. Oh, yeah.
3261760	3264200	But the biggest the biggest ones.
3264240	3266200	Oh, and there's another game and I have to have this.
3266200	3267800	It's called Bad Cats.
3267800	3270920	And it has this little thing in the middle of it
3270920	3274040	where like this lady is trying to chase a cat out with a broom
3274400	3278080	and the cats all over the table are just like living their best life.
3278080	3280440	I love this table. It's so good.
3280440	3283760	But yeah, I played a lot of pinball, but I absolutely think
3283800	3287000	that the star of the show was Foo Fighters.
3287000	3289280	Both versions are tremendously good.
3289640	3294040	And if there's someone who knows
3294640	3299360	how to have fun in pinball, it's definitely going to be Jack Danger.
3299360	3302600	Also, he's given me good advice for buying Dan a birthday present once.
3303360	3306880	He's just a cool guy, but he's actually retired from streaming now, I think.
3308440	3311920	Yeah, but at any any rate, of course, Dead by Daylight,
3312600	3313640	significant amounts.
3313640	3316720	I played Midnight Sun's Cult of the Land.
3316720	3319920	The new DLC is absolutely hilarious. I love it.
3321240	3324360	I've been having a pretty solid good time in that. So, yeah.
3325800	3329200	All right. Well, if that is it for your gaming week, we'll go to Loki.
3329200	3331120	How was your gaming week?
3331120	3333160	My gaming week was just Minecraft.
3333160	3336720	I'm doing lots of building and getting ready to put out another episode.
3336720	3338880	So nice. Yep.
3338880	3340880	It was a lot of a lot of building.
3340880	3344480	Look forward to see. Is it another like like how many bricks in this build?
3345600	3346680	I don't know.
3346680	3350440	I don't know because like the because it involved digging out a big hole.
3350440	3353480	So it it's hard to say.
3353480	3356520	There was it was forty six shulker boxes at one point.
3356520	3361640	But I didn't I think I I tend to like try to get myself extras
3361640	3366240	in case I miss something in my schematic that I put together like
3367240	3370920	or I want to blend in some of the terrain a little bit more or something like that.
3371240	3373960	So I don't know if I used all of them.
3373960	3374520	I have that.
3374520	3377160	I was going to calculate it when I'm done with all the build,
3377560	3381960	but it's pretty much done and just have the redstone left to do inside of it.
3381960	3384200	But yeah, there's another giant Mega Man thing that's in there.
3384400	3386000	All right. Nice.
3386000	3387920	Looking forward to seeing it. Yep.
3387920	3388200	All right.
3388200	3390920	My gaming week, because I was on a business trip most of the week,
3390920	3392560	my gaming week was a little abbreviated.
3392560	3395840	But Dark Soccer, you made this is going to surprise you.
3396160	3399960	I also played pinball when I was down there because San Diego has a coin
3399960	3401240	up like they have here in SAC.
3401240	3403680	And, you know, the coin up chain, for whatever reason, they really like pinball.
3403920	3406840	I also played the Foo Fighters table this time.
3407080	3409120	Isn't it good? It's really good.
3409120	3410920	I don't know if it was regular or limited edition.
3410920	3413560	I'm sorry. Actually, did it have a top layer?
3413680	3415600	I don't think so.
3415600	3418640	But let me check, because actually what I can do is thanks to that whole,
3418640	3421480	like stern insider thing, which I love.
3421800	3425800	You can see I can actually see my history of what I played here.
3425800	3427480	So I can actually tell you.
3427480	3430200	But I know I played that Avengers machine for the first time,
3430360	3433680	and I got two free replays on my first game of that.
3433880	3436800	So that was like awesome that I was able to do that.
3437040	3440200	So let's see, I'm going in and looking right now.
3444280	3447040	OK, Foo Fighters Pro, it says pro.
3447560	3448680	All right, you play the pro.
3448680	3453600	OK, and then I played Godzilla Pro Avengers Infinity Quest.
3453600	3455560	That was a machine I got three replays on.
3455600	3458000	Was pro. And then I played Mandalorian.
3458000	3459440	Yeah. Yeah.
3459440	3461320	The Avengers game is actually pretty good.
3461320	3463040	I liked it. I liked it.
3463040	3464440	So that was, yeah,
3464440	3468520	random pinball adventure of my own that when I was trying to kill time
3468520	3470440	in San Diego in the evening.
3470440	3471480	If I can add one more thing.
3471480	3476400	Yeah, we actually just getting rid of our medieval madness.
3476400	3479200	And I forgot what else we got rid of.
3479440	3481720	It might have been Iron Maiden.
3482600	3484560	And we now have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3484560	3487800	The newer one. Oh, we have Black Knight Sword of Rage.
3488480	3491120	And we have we already had the limited edition topper.
3491120	3492800	So that's getting added on.
3492800	3494600	And then, of course, Weird Al's on his way.
3494600	3498280	I'm I'm sure you've heard of it, but I was listening to Bobby's show last week
3498280	3500440	since we weren't here to hear it live.
3500440	3501200	And he was talking about
3501200	3505360	like a vinyl soundtrack for some pinball games, including medieval madness.
3505360	3508960	And I was like, total nuclear annihilation is getting one. Interesting.
3508960	3511600	I just I wasn't sure if you were on this because I knew you were a fan
3511600	3512400	of medieval madness.
3512400	3515160	And I this the like when I heard the song that
3516880	3519560	like that whole thing of like, oh, I've heard this in Darksiders garage.
3520360	3522560	That was only that was Black Knight 2000.
3522920	3524600	Oh, no. Yes, it was Black Knight.
3524600	3526960	Sorry. Medieval something.
3526960	3531160	Sword of Rage has a Black Knight 2000 mode
3531160	3533720	that plays some of the the old stuff.
3533960	3534920	Interesting.
3534920	3537840	By the way, I sent you the picture of the of the bad cats.
3538320	3539280	I'll have to check that out.
3539280	3541680	Sorry, my phone is on monitor right now. But yeah.
3542720	3543600	Discord.
3543600	3546080	As far as video games go, I've been playing more Dead by Daylight
3546080	3549280	than I usually do, just with the double blood points happening this weekend.
3549280	3551520	I'm like, oh, I guess I should like actually work on the tome.
3551760	3555360	So I finally got Renaldo to prestige one.
3555360	3557200	That's cool, I guess.
3557200	3559400	Renaldo is so loud, though.
3559440	3561440	Oh, well, I mean, I just wanted his perks.
3561440	3565120	So yeah. But do you think he's like Leon levels of loud?
3565920	3566920	He's pretty loud.
3566920	3569200	I thought they were going to equalize that.
3569200	3571600	They're supposed to equalize all the volumes at some point. I don't know.
3571920	3573520	But I've been I've been working on.
3573520	3578040	So I have like every perk on Cheryl, every perk on Leon, purple perk meeting.
3578840	3580520	I want to do that for Dwight.
3580520	3582160	I think I'm going to work on now as well.
3582160	3584520	So, yeah, so it's been placed in Dead by Daylight.
3584720	3588360	Final Fantasy 14 got a new patch this week, the Dark Throne.
3589080	3592280	This is the one where Golbez is a big fight in it.
3592280	3595400	I mean, spoiler alert, but we know that they've been doing
3595400	3598480	a lot of Final Fantasy 4 content with these patches.
3598480	3600720	So it just was natural that you're going to fight Golbez.
3601200	3602840	I thought they did it really well.
3602840	3608160	Again, Soken kicks butt on the soundtrack and he did a remix of the moon theme
3608440	3611480	that plays on the outside of the moon, the really haunting kind of song.
3611480	3614800	He did that for like the I won't get too much into the details,
3614800	3618600	but for the place, you would assume a theme like that would be used
3619200	3622680	in Final Fantasy 14 as well is very, very well done.
3622680	3624400	So I like where the story went there.
3624400	3627640	I'm very curious to see what the expansion lead up ends up being,
3628120	3630800	because I could see it kind of go in a couple of different directions right now.
3631080	3632480	So it'd be very interesting.
3634440	3636440	Yeah, so that was pretty much my gaming week, honestly,
3636440	3637720	not a lot of new stuff.
3637720	3639880	But this week, I know there's some big stuff coming.
3639880	3642400	So I'm very, very excited about it, that's for sure.
3642400	3645280	All right, we're going to get into some news here at the top of the show,
3645840	3648040	even though we're like an hour in because the PlayStation Showcase.
3648040	3651840	But I thought we could start tonight with some headlines that actually focus
3651840	3655280	on last week because we we missed some big announcements
3655280	3656880	by not being here last week.
3656880	3660320	So, Loki, what was one of the big things we heard about last week?
3660920	3666040	Last week, we got the reveal of the new game from NetherRealm Studios.
3666040	3668880	It is another reboot of Mortal Kombat.
3668880	3672360	So now Mortal Kombat one is going to be coming out September 19th.
3672360	3675720	Let's do the time warp again.
3676800	3680880	It would technically just reset the timeline in Mortal Kombat 11.
3681440	3686240	Yeah, that's but now but now it's like, oh, but in this timeline now,
3686360	3691680	Sub-Zero and Scorpion can be friends, as can maybe Katana and Mileena.
3691680	3698920	So now and now Liu Kang is a god and Raiden's just a normal farmer.
3698920	3702440	So that was from the end of Mortal Kombat 11.
3702440	3705560	No, I know. So yeah, they are they are continuing the story,
3705560	3710400	but I can't help but feel like, OK, they just did this in Mortal Kombat 9.
3710400	3714400	But OK, I mean, do we really care? Nah.
3714600	3718200	Like, as long as the game's good, who gives a shit?
3718400	3720960	Let him reboot it every game. Who cares?
3721160	3725320	Just just have some good characters, some good moves, fluid gameplay,
3725320	3728240	and people are going to eat it up. It's fine.
3728240	3731440	I think the like alternate take could be interesting.
3731800	3734080	But the only thing that's going to be weird about it, sorry.
3734320	3736600	The only thing that's going to be weird about it is that meanwhile,
3736600	3740240	we have these updates on the Mortal Kombat 2 movie.
3740560	3744200	So they've cast the actresses that are going to play like Jade and Katana,
3744200	3746160	like some of the news is out there about that.
3746160	3749040	So they're doing a second Mortal Kombat movie, obviously.
3749160	3750920	But now it's like, OK, wait a minute.
3750920	3754400	So now we have the movie timeline, the game timeline
3754640	3757280	that it's starting to feel like Marvel over here.
3759480	3762040	So but it's fine. It's just it's just funny.
3764360	3767200	Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's it's.
3768280	3771600	I assume the movie is going to be like a different.
3772160	3776200	I mean, they have like I don't know if that movie really felt like
3776200	3779320	it followed one of the official timelines of the game.
3780400	3783640	They kind of do their own thing, but.
3783640	3785480	I'm sure it'll be fine.
3786280	3788600	Comment in chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network.
3789000	3793000	Zen Monkey 11 says I was over Mortal Kombat after Mortal Kombat 3,
3793320	3794920	as were a lot of people, to be fair.
3794920	3797000	Not everybody took to the 3D.
3797000	3800560	I liked Mortal Kombat 4 and I think 4 had some really good characters.
3800600	3801440	Like I love Tanya.
3801440	3805000	I love like who is the wind god, Fujin, I think.
3805200	3808520	Like there were some really good characters in 4 that I liked.
3808520	3810480	But I understand the shift to 3D.
3811320	3815640	It didn't work completely for Mortal Kombat.
3815920	3819240	And then I think what made Mortal Kombat hard to follow for me
3819240	3821960	for a while was that it left the arcades.
3822360	3826640	So then they had a string of a bunch of games like Deadly Alliance,
3827200	3830400	Armageddon and all these games that were console only releases.
3830560	3831240	Basically.
3831240	3834280	So I think a lot of people and they didn't number them anymore.
3834280	3836440	So I think a lot of people kind of fell out of the series
3836600	3840200	while they were releasing these console only things that wasn't having
3840880	3842800	parity with arcade releases.
3842800	3848120	And then finally, Mortal Kombat 9 essentially rebooted Mortal Kombat.
3848120	3849680	That was the first reboot.
3849680	3852040	And that was I mean, because that was kind of a neat.
3852040	3855160	Even though, yes, I play those games, I'm like, God, the violence is
3855160	3857720	the violence is starting to be a bit much in these games, especially
3858280	3859720	11 and 10.
3859720	3862240	Like, damn, it's it's hard to watch.
3862480	3864600	It's hard to watch, quite frankly.
3864600	3868880	But at least I know when to look away, you know, the game.
3868880	3871320	But the game itself is really fluid.
3872600	3875000	So it's it's it's it is a good fighter.
3875000	3876520	Like it's you can't deny that.
3876520	3878200	So there's that.
3879800	3884600	Anyway, so I'm excited for Mortal Kombat 1, just from a story perspective,
3884600	3887800	as much as I tease it for doing the time warp again,
3887800	3889400	I think it will be kind of interesting.
3889400	3891200	And I'm curious what direction they go with it.
3891200	3893160	But of course, it is about the gameplay.
3893160	3894840	So. All right.
3894840	3897560	Well, moving on to another story here.
3897560	3902600	Unfortunately, last week, we had a legend in the industry pass away.
3902600	3906400	So I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of Bob
3906400	3909080	Smith to video game culture.
3909680	3913160	Bob Smith was from Atari and iMagic back in the day.
3913880	3916280	He was a programmer at Atari in the early 80s.
3916280	3920320	His first big game was video pinball, which was a pretty, pretty epic.
3920320	3924920	I mean, obviously you play it now and you go, this is kind of compared to like
3924920	3926720	but for its time, right?
3926720	3929200	It was like, oh, it's like pinball on my TV.
3929200	3930960	It was pretty cool for the time.
3930960	3931880	So he brought that.
3931880	3935920	But I mean, if you think about it, that would be like the first pinball video game.
3936440	3939840	I think there may be a computer game that predates it.
3939840	3941400	But the first major, I guess we'll say that
3941920	3944600	he was then a supervisor.
3944600	3947080	He actually was Howard Scott Warshaw's boss.
3947400	3951160	So, you know, you could maybe blame ET a little bit on him.
3951160	3955160	No, I don't know. Anyway, he also programmed games to the Atari 2600,
3955160	3958280	including one of my very favorites from iMagic.
3958280	3962160	I did a YouTube on this that's still on my channel like seven years ago.
3962160	3965560	Dragon Fire, one of my absolute favorite 2600 games.
3965560	3966480	You are correct.
3966480	3967840	What?
3967840	3969600	About video pinball.
3969600	3971040	It was the first? OK, cool.
3971440	3973600	1977. Wow.
3973600	3976000	Golly, golly. OK, so.
3976440	3980200	But yeah, he did Dragon Fire, which is a really underrated classic.
3980360	3981640	Riddle of the Sphinx.
3981640	3983400	That's a really good game, too.
3983400	3985360	Holy shit. That's a trip down memory lane.
3985360	3987880	I haven't thought of that game a long time.
3987880	3989080	Moonsweeper.
3989080	3993560	And he did the port of the Star Wars arcade game that was on Atari,
3993760	3997600	which for what it was, was the best they could do on the Atari hardware.
3997600	3999880	So that's that's awesome.
3999880	4004600	So kudos and a tip of the hat to Bob Smith on an incredible career
4005160	4008840	who went on to work at companies like Accolade, the 3DO company,
4009400	4013480	and then a mobile startup called Innovative Leisure that was by some Xbox folks.
4013680	4017240	He also went to the Portland Retro Game Expo an awful lot.
4017240	4020960	So but unfortunately, yes, he passed away last week.
4020960	4025160	So just rest in peace and thank you for the contributions to gaming culture.
4025160	4027760	Thank you, Tiger Claw, for digging up the YouTube channel
4027920	4032040	and the YouTube on Dragonfire, which again, it's a great game.
4032040	4033960	It's one of those.
4033960	4037760	It's that formula of the 2600 era that I love.
4038040	4043200	It's an incredibly simple concept with a highly addictive game loop.
4043520	4045760	And Dragonfire was basically two screens.
4045760	4047800	It was the bridge screen and the treasure room screen.
4048000	4049080	And when you're on the bridge,
4049080	4052080	you're dodging fire that the dragon's spitting at you, basically.
4052240	4053760	And then when he gets to the treasure room,
4053760	4057080	you try to collect all the treasure again while dodging the dragon's fire.
4057280	4058320	You escape that.
4058320	4061240	You're back on the bridge and you're doing this game loop over and over.
4061240	4063680	And it's very it's very addictive.
4063680	4065400	And I know that sounds very simple,
4065400	4068320	but a lot of the 2600 games were and that's what made them great.
4068560	4070520	Think about a game like Kaboom,
4070520	4073880	which is like one of the all time greatest Atari 2600 games.
4074160	4077160	What a simple fucking game.
4077680	4080280	And that's the one with the water buckets where you catch the bombs.
4080320	4081960	That's all. It was a paddle game.
4081960	4084240	That's all you've you've played this at some point in your life.
4084240	4085680	You all have. Yeah.
4085720	4087880	It's an incredibly simple game,
4087880	4092040	but without it, there's so much other that followed it.
4092040	4094160	Anyway, I'm digressing a little bit.
4094160	4095920	Old man yells at Cloud.
4095920	4097280	Let's move on.
4097280	4099880	Dark Soccer, now I know you want to talk to us about some Dead
4099880	4101760	by Daylight news that came out last week,
4101760	4103920	but I think a little more important,
4103920	4106640	possibly some community updates from this week.
4106640	4107640	I want to give you some space
4107640	4110160	to talk about what's going on in the DVD community, actually.
4111080	4113200	So for anyone,
4113200	4116680	I don't think that hardly anyone has ever gone
4116680	4119800	to a Dead by Daylight stream and not heard of PUPPERS.
4120240	4122280	Well, I mean, especially, you know,
4123320	4126480	behavior issued like a a charm.
4126480	4129320	But but PUPPERS has been dealing with ALS,
4129320	4133000	which was formerly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
4133720	4138440	It's a neuromotor function disorder that causes
4139560	4143000	in the spine to start stiffening up and it affects,
4143000	4145080	of course, respiration, everything else.
4145080	4146440	It's terrible. It's terrible.
4146440	4148400	Yeah, it's pretty bad.
4148400	4151640	And well, PUPPERS has it.
4152040	4156200	And on the 25th, you went into respiratory distress
4156200	4159040	and went into the hospital
4159040	4163800	and needed a bunch of oxygen, but just decided to to come home.
4164160	4166240	You know, there there wouldn't have been.
4167480	4170120	According to what what Sunshine Post did,
4170120	4173080	there isn't going to be like much use in it.
4173080	4176280	It would just be a few days of prolonging as opposed to,
4176880	4179640	you know, anything significant.
4179640	4185440	But then as of the 27th, so yesterday for us,
4186760	4190680	he went back into the hospital because of aspiration pneumonia.
4191280	4194520	And so right now he's in the hospital.
4194520	4196080	But there's a kudos board up.
4196080	4197040	I'll find the link.
4197040	4201120	And apparently all of these messages
4201120	4204720	of affection and support have just meant a whole lot.
4204720	4210320	So I'm going to find the kudos board and link it to everybody.
4210720	4215760	So if you want to, you know, leave a a good word,
4215760	4219400	then I'm sure that it would be very appreciated.
4219400	4222240	Well, well, there's still time to do so.
4222840	4226160	I will point out as well, you know, for those that play the game,
4226160	4228680	maybe a little bit lightly or what have you.
4228680	4232520	I will point out that there is a charm you can actually get in the game
4232520	4233760	and you can still get it.
4233760	4236600	And the code is warrior puppers, all one word there.
4236600	4238840	And you can actually get a charm.
4238840	4240040	And there's a lot of people in game.
4240040	4243760	You might actually saw this charm on a hook this weekend while I was playing.
4244000	4247240	And it actually took me a minute to have it click.
4247400	4250720	And then when I was on Twitter later, I was like, oh, right.
4250920	4253800	And so that's actually so there's a lot of people that are rocking this charm,
4253800	4256360	just kind of like in support right now of everything.
4256360	4258600	So, again, that's warrior puppers.
4258600	4261800	I haven't I haven't played since all that went down
4262040	4265760	except to log in for my my daily bonuses.
4267000	4269800	But yeah, when I sign on tonight,
4270320	4275680	I'm going to be going in and the Vic Viper will be retired in favor of puppers.
4277400	4281000	So, yeah, so obviously, you know, and I will admit
4281000	4284120	I was not super familiar with puppers until.
4284440	4286120	But I have a lot of friends that are.
4286120	4289920	So it's it's getting in the algorithm in my social media person.
4289960	4292120	Yeah. And I actually went back and watched some clips
4292120	4293440	and he seemed like a lot of fun.
4293440	4295600	And boy, does the man resemble bald Dwight.
4295880	4298360	That was right.
4298360	4300440	That was like, dang,
4300440	4307000	there's really resembles him saying that Dwight should be renamed Max.
4307000	4310920	Mm hmm. I honestly think that the bald Dwight
4311200	4316640	skin just needs to be made the like the Max cosmetic, kind of like how
4317040	4321080	there's other character cosmetics for like there's the Chris and Carlos
4321080	4322520	for Leon and whatnot.
4322520	4327360	I've seen some discourse trademark patent pending on Twitter about
4327560	4332360	would it be appropriate to have him as a survivor in the game that gets killed?
4332360	4334960	It might be a little in poor taste for some.
4334960	4339880	My perspective is do whatever the family and him wants in this case.
4340120	4341520	I think it would be very nice.
4341520	4344480	I think a nice, you know, this this particular charm
4344480	4346640	we just talked about, they gave away for free.
4346640	4351080	What if they did a shirt where the funds raised from the shirt for
4351320	4355480	for a survivor, Dwight or whoever, although how would it not be Dwight?
4355640	4358800	But like the survivor shirt, maybe for the core four or something
4359400	4363880	that maybe can raise money for ALS research and support.
4363920	4365720	I thought I'd buy that in a heartbeat.
4365720	4367920	I think that would be a great thing to do.
4367920	4370360	Behavior actually put out a really sweet letter
4370360	4374480	and even harkened back to that Dwight resemblance. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. So.
4376080	4381120	I don't know, I think that we'll we'll see something, you know, when when people
4382040	4387240	you know, when people like that have touched so many others, you know.
4388920	4391440	They they just become
4392160	4395120	something a little bit more than just the person, you know what I mean?
4396280	4400280	And I would have to agree that everyone's been calling them
4400280	4402960	a light in the fog, and I agree. Yeah.
4404280	4408240	So well, our thoughts go out to the family and the loved ones, for sure.
4408680	4411760	And of course, puppers in this case.
4411760	4415320	I my my my comment on the Kudo board was that
4415320	4418160	I hope that these next days are full of peace. Mm hmm.
4419160	4422720	Um, anyway, I know it's a difficult pivot, but let's talk about some of the other
4422720	4426200	Dead by Daylight news that came out officially from Behavior
4426200	4429760	this this two weeks ago, I guess this one because of leaks.
4430400	4434800	Behavior did their anniversary live stream early.
4436320	4441040	And and I'll I'll be honest, I I had already watched the trailers
4441040	4444720	and everything myself, but they had done that teaser at first
4444720	4447800	saying that Nicolas Cage was going to be in the game as a survivor.
4448200	4451400	And while we're not seeing much of anything official, Eurogamer.
4452600	4457520	Said that that according from to the official blurb,
4457520	4461040	I'll just read this after countless awards and over 100 movies
4461040	4464600	shot across the globe, Nicolas Cage has seen it all and done it all.
4464600	4465680	Or so he thought.
4465680	4468360	While on set filming the role of a lifetime, his performance
4468360	4472080	summoned the entity, a malevolent being of incomprehensible power,
4472800	4474320	a.k.a. Mia.
4474320	4478160	The actor soon found himself cast in otherworldly, worldly fog,
4478160	4481040	forced to survive against a host of terrifying killers
4481040	4483480	deadlier than even the most scathing film critic.
4483920	4486040	That means they have to have Roger Ebert as a killer.
4487520	4491480	Just saying, I, I really don't know what to think about this.
4491520	4495520	This is just really like, do you do you remember the meme
4495520	4498520	from like 10 years ago of the old lady going, what?
4499040	4502520	Like that, that was my reaction to this trailer. What?
4503040	4504560	But it's okay.
4504560	4508480	Honestly though, the outfit that he was wearing in the trailer,
4508480	4512400	someone pointed out that it's very much like in another movie coming out.
4513640	4517680	So I'm not sure, but there were quite a few things that were brought up
4517680	4521000	in the seventh anniversary live stream.
4521000	4523560	Oh, just real quick before you get into that, I'm sorry.
4523560	4525600	I just want to say, I don't hate this for the record.
4525600	4528720	I think it's it's a very Nic Cage thing to do.
4529040	4530720	So why not?
4530760	4532680	Loki, let me ask you for a minute.
4532680	4537040	Does Nic Cage in Dead by Daylight make you more interested in Dead by Daylight?
4537600	4539960	It does increase my interest in Dead by Daylight.
4540000	4541160	See, there you go.
4541160	4544800	And that's that's the why I would be so that I would be interested
4544800	4547800	to see like what like they pair them up with.
4547840	4549680	Because I'm going to become a Nic Main.
4549680	4550600	Well, they don't.
4550600	4554280	To be fair, there are characters that come out with no killer.
4554280	4558880	Like, for example, Ash from Evil Dead does not have a counterpart killer.
4558920	4559920	And there are just as.
4559920	4563240	And there's killers that came out without survivors like Leatherface and Ghostface.
4563240	4567200	As long as he gets a perk called One True God, then we're good, I think.
4569720	4571720	I think it goes back to the red.
4571720	4574480	So those that have a raising Arizona skin.
4576200	4578960	But it's actually it's funny because it was
4580320	4582400	Tiara was the one who told me
4583480	4586640	and they were like, are they trying to get me to play this game?
4587040	4591960	I'm like, if anyone I know loves Nic Cage, it's them for sure.
4591960	4596640	So, yeah, anyway, there there is so much more awesome, though,
4597000	4601160	because they're going to be a lot of quality of life improvements,
4601160	4604120	including an anti camping technique,
4604360	4607320	which isn't too far off from the one I suggested.
4607320	4612280	Remember, I said that the the countdown timer should stop
4612680	4614800	depending on the distance of the killer to the hook.
4615280	4619640	Well, now what's going to happen is that there's a timer. Yes.
4619960	4622600	But it's the closer they are to the hook.
4623160	4627320	The the killer, the killer, the survivor on the hook
4627960	4632840	will be able to unhook themselves a lot deliverance or slippery meat.
4633160	4635240	But it also works on second hook.
4636600	4640200	OLR stays winning on the predictions in 2023, that's for sure.
4640800	4644360	But I do kind of see abuse for the second hook one for people who bring Moris.
4645080	4649960	Mm hmm. Now they would do something about tumbling, then we'd be perfect.
4649960	4651360	But we know we're waiting on it.
4651360	4655800	And then, of course, there was the new trailer for in transmission,
4656120	4660120	which is therefore aid the sci fi horror, which I think is cool.
4661200	4666560	They have the killer is called the Singularity, which is this.
4667760	4672800	I guess it's a cybernetic creature that started absorbing human parts
4673320	4677600	so that it could function more effectively and killed everybody.
4677600	4679880	You know, very aliens, alien like.
4679880	4683760	And Gabriel Soma is the survivor and he's very pretty.
4685040	4687480	The Mori is disgusting, by the way.
4688600	4691320	Have you seen have you seen the Mori? It's disgusting.
4691960	4694000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4694000	4698040	I saw Nick play some of it on because, you know, I still can't get PTB
4698040	4700200	to work on the thing. Right.
4700200	4702520	Not like the Borg. Think of the Borg in reverse.
4703440	4705680	OK, wait, I'm going to I'm going to play this on stream,
4705680	4707200	but I'm going to put a content warning out.
4707200	4709720	But I am I am just playing a video game here.
4710000	4712280	So and you won't be able to see us on the podcast feed anyway.
4712280	4715080	But let me let me play this Mori for you on stream here.
4715080	4717520	Sorry, I'm getting it set up here because you'll see that this
4717760	4720320	it really goes next level with some of the light gore
4720320	4722160	that they're doing in the game, basically.
4722160	4724360	So and that's the new survivor.
4724360	4727840	And so it's it's pretty gross. But
4729080	4731800	that's what some people want out of Dead by Daylight
4731800	4733240	is melted faces.
4733240	4734600	So there you go.
4734600	4736600	OK, the shot is done for those that looked away.
4737240	4740800	All right. At any at any rate, the well, you know,
4740800	4743160	people are just going to walk around taking pictures of the corpses.
4743200	4745040	I'm sorry, I do that.
4745400	4749000	But but anyway, the thing's power is really neat, though,
4749000	4751680	because you put these globs up that act as cameras.
4752240	4756920	And so you can pretty much watch like whole areas of the map
4757320	4760320	and then shoot the glob onto somebody.
4760680	4763040	And you have to do shit to get it off.
4763040	4765200	And yeah, I'm not going to go in.
4765200	4769720	I love S.H.A. 100 Matt's comment in chat saying like any horror franchise,
4769720	4771760	it eventually ends up in space. Yes.
4771760	4775800	And Fixation Gaze, big fan of the Mori saying DBD needs more of this.
4776400	4778440	There are a lot of people
4778440	4781400	who does not like getting Moried at all.
4781920	4784480	Like, I will die on that second hook to avoid a Mori.
4785080	4786680	That's just how I am.
4786680	4787680	I don't know what it is.
4787680	4789680	It's just like some thing in my brain.
4789680	4792280	But at any rate,
4792280	4795640	they're also going to be doing partnerships for cosmetics
4795640	4798080	for with Slipknot and Iron Maiden.
4798440	4803040	And the one that makes me really happy is with Nakamura Ikumi,
4803600	4807640	who is just a wonderful, wonderful concept artist.
4807640	4811240	But my the best cosmetic in the universe is coming out.
4811520	4814080	We are finally getting Sukeban Julie.
4814080	4819760	I've told we know what a Sukeban is, right?
4822200	4824120	Well, for the listeners that don't.
4824120	4829360	OK, so it was very much a big trope in like 80s manga anime TV.
4829760	4834080	It's the the schoolgirl that wears the extra long like Zaki in Project Justice.
4834320	4838520	Mm hmm. Or Sukeban Deco, which was another anime, The Girl with the Yo-Yo.
4839280	4843360	But like wear the mask, although hers is the full legion mask,
4843400	4848360	the hair pulled back and the extra long pleated skirt and the kind of oversized,
4849200	4852600	you know, sailor top and, you know, kind of a bad ass girl.
4852840	4856640	It kind of like go go you body. But.
4857680	4860640	This is. Yeah, and she did.
4860640	4864480	She had just a regular schoolgirl outfit and not a not the Sukeban look
4864480	4867320	is very specific, but I'll find I'll find a picture.
4867320	4871640	But for anyone who played Project Justice, it's Zaki kind of same
4871680	4873960	same relative look.
4873960	4878400	Yeah. And not like the sweater outfit, but the full on sailor top.
4879160	4883040	But anyway, I'm very happy about that because Julie needs
4883520	4886800	all the love because Susie gets all the cosmetics. Just saying.
4888200	4890760	All right. To our relative.
4891280	4892160	There's one more thing. One more.
4892160	4894480	Yeah, I was to say, there's one more thing I'm waiting for you to get to,
4894480	4896440	because I think it's really exciting.
4896440	4901040	Yeah, but supermassive games, as in the group
4901040	4907440	that did the quarry is going to be working on a game
4907440	4910080	with their subsidiary, Midwinter Entertainment,
4910320	4915640	doing a new game in the Dead by Daylight universe.
4916480	4922160	It's a single player interactive story that will sit
4922160	4925080	sit very well with the lore of Dead by Daylight,
4925080	4927480	even though half the lore contradicts itself, but whatever.
4928480	4931920	So you will have a team of up to four players
4932520	4937120	going into a different area in the in the entities realm.
4937760	4941960	And, you know, I'm guessing sort of like
4942440	4945600	maybe like left for dead ish is kind of my thought. Yeah.
4946360	4952040	But I, I, I really like it, although I think that having something
4952040	4956440	kind of like the quarry in Dead by Daylight universe would be also cool as well.
4956440	4958920	As to be awesome. I as soon as that was announced,
4958920	4962880	I got a text from our pal Shane, who, you know, he's usually pretty.
4963360	4967160	Yeah. Oh, is he? He was usually pretty whatever about Dead by Daylight.
4967440	4970840	But yeah, when the supermassive thing was announced, he's like, all right,
4970960	4972880	I guess I have to be interested in Dead by Daylight now,
4972880	4974760	because supermassive is making a game about it.
4974760	4977600	And I'm like, honestly, there's a ton of original characters.
4977600	4979040	It makes that's actually how I heard about it,
4979040	4980640	because I wasn't able to watch the thing live.
4980640	4981920	Oh, yeah, Shane is in chat.
4981920	4984680	Supermassive game is what will get me interested in DVD,
4984800	4988160	which is crazy, since DVD has a good amount of characters I love already.
4988400	4991640	I wouldn't expect the licensed characters get over into the supermassive game,
4991640	4995280	but like it's got a lot of interesting characters in it,
4995280	4997200	especially in the survivor side of things.
4997200	5002480	I mean, some of the killers are very like, like to me, like Billy is like,
5002480	5006120	because they didn't have Leatherface license yet. So they made.
5006440	5011520	So some of it's very derivative, but some of some of the killers are really cool.
5012280	5014040	Well, and of course, that also leads
5014040	5016880	to the mini game in Dead by Daylight when you hear a chainsaw.
5016880	5019080	Which one is it? Yeah, right.
5020040	5024800	But but yeah, I kind of have have a feeling that it would be like
5025320	5028080	the first for, you know, Dwight, Meg,
5028920	5031000	Jake and Claudette. Yeah.
5031360	5034360	As as the four and, you know, being,
5035040	5038920	quote, the first, I'd say, group together in the fog. Yep.
5039160	5042800	You know, and there's a fanfic I actually super like,
5042800	5046520	I'll just touch on it for a second and someone fixie, it's that fanfic
5047680	5052240	where they talk in this fix, like little headcanon thing.
5053040	5057280	They had that when you meet somebody in a match
5057280	5061440	and bring them out with you, that they can join your campfire.
5062040	5066640	And that that's how, you know, even people who had been there for a while,
5066840	5069120	how they eventually came to meet each other.
5070240	5075360	And so I kind of like that idea and adapting that into this game,
5075360	5078760	that they were like the first people to meet up and actually be a team.
5079080	5080760	I guess it wasn't the supermassive game,
5080760	5083760	but the other game you were talking about, like the the more sci fi.
5084560	5087560	No, no, no. The other DBD spinoff game that they're making
5087920	5092000	that sounded like it was about the survivors or excuse me,
5092600	5095000	like not the folks in the entity,
5095000	5098280	but the families and friends of people that have been abducted
5098280	5102160	by the entity looking for them, that that's like the plot of that game.
5105040	5110000	That sounds like a neat concept for a game, too.
5110000	5111960	So where was this from?
5111960	5113840	I don't know. No, no, no.
5113840	5116280	It's it's a legit thing that they announced. I don't remember.
5117400	5119720	I haven't seen that. Dang it.
5119720	5120320	Let me see.
5123000	5125360	Sorry, if you can hear my typing coming through.
5126440	5129960	I have a life left because I'll just be doing nothing but playing all of this.
5131000	5135080	OK, OK. Supermassive is making the quarry
5135080	5138040	is making the single player adventure game like,
5138160	5140360	but you mentioned midwinter entertainment.
5140360	5145120	They are making the other game, the PVE co-op game that is its own thing.
5145120	5147080	So these are two separate games.
5147080	5150840	By the way, I put the picture of Julie as the skib on.
5151440	5154800	And of course, her knife is like a tanto. I love it.
5156200	5159000	The other, by the way, the other characters getting the treatment
5159000	5161720	from Nakamura-san is the oni.
5161720	5164880	He's getting sort of like the classic ghost where
5165560	5167760	he's got the candles attached to his head.
5167760	5172000	For anyone who ever watch Ranma and Nibu no Ichi, it's like Ghost and Coogie.
5172840	5177920	And then Yui is getting sort of like a semi posh exercisey look.
5178440	5180480	It's like Yui's day off, I guess.
5181560	5185320	But anyway, yeah, I thought Yui's getting new cosmetics, too.
5185360	5189000	So, yeah, there's a lot of exciting stuff going on in Dead by Daylight.
5189240	5191800	I know we talk about this game a lot because we play it a lot,
5191800	5195160	but I'll say one other quick thing about it and then we'll move on to other games
5196040	5200040	because there was a comment that came up in chat and hooked on you on consoles.
5200920	5204200	Fixie brought up that, you know, Nick Cage, it's not uncommon
5204200	5207960	for them to release killer or survivors by themselves.
5207960	5212280	And actually, if you look at the roadmap,
5212280	5214520	which I think Fixie had pointed out,
5214520	5217840	the roadmap actually shows that there's going to be either it is it seems
5217840	5220320	in this new roadmap, there is some new stuff coming out
5220320	5222640	where killers or survivors are being released on their own.
5222640	5224400	It actually looks like for this year,
5224400	5228760	a lot of these upcoming releases are going to be solo killers or survivors,
5228760	5231680	which indicates they're probably killers
5232000	5235200	that don't necessarily have a memorable survivor, I hate to say it,
5235760	5239840	or my hope is the survivor that's coming out on their own.
5240080	5246080	My hope, my prayer, my demonic worshiping circle, Sidney Prescott,
5246080	5249520	please let that be the survivor that's coming out on their own
5249520	5252160	to finally couple with Ghostface. I hope, I hope.
5253480	5257840	But it's not the same Ghostface unless they do like
5259240	5262120	like another skin that would be...
5262160	5265680	They could, yeah, do another skin or I don't think anybody's going to care.
5265680	5268040	I mean, maybe the Laura Piris will, fine.
5268040	5271840	But like put Nev and Sidney, they could...
5271960	5275280	I don't think that Nev has signed off on that, on her likeness.
5275280	5279160	They could, I could also honestly, and this would be a little bit cheaper,
5279160	5279840	but they could do it.
5279840	5282640	But I could see them doing the sisters from five and six,
5283240	5286120	Jenny Ortega, and I can't remember the other gal's name,
5286280	5289240	but I could see them doing them as survivors as kind of a
5290000	5292680	the Freddy character we got was Quentin.
5292880	5294880	Oh, that would be my other pick.
5294880	5299680	Heather Logenkamp from Freddy would be a great solo survivor.
5299880	5302880	Yeah. Although, although if they bring out Nancy,
5302880	5305440	I want a freaking Alice skin, OK?
5305640	5308280	Alice was the best. She kicked way more ass.
5311400	5312960	I'm talking about original Nancy.
5312960	5316320	Yeah. And Shane points out the franchise is moving on from Nev's character.
5316320	5317600	So it'd also be weird at this point,
5317600	5322600	not necessarily because we get classic character releases sometimes,
5322600	5325800	but I could absolutely see them doing the sisters from the newer movies.
5326360	5327960	As far as solo killers,
5329400	5332920	it's funny that somebody brought up the Babadook because actually I,
5333280	5337400	I think the community would go fucking wild if for Pride Month,
5337440	5340280	they announced the Babadook as a new killer. I'm sorry.
5340320	5343960	Like people would go crazy. I think that would be incredible.
5344200	5346960	I have no idea what the powers would be or anything, but they'll make,
5346960	5351760	they'll figure out a way. They will. I also, I'm still hoping someday Penny,
5351800	5354920	I know we have a clown already, but we don't have Pennywise from it.
5355000	5357440	And that's, that's the killer I most want to see. License.
5357560	5361360	Fixie brought up Candyman and that's actually been a rumor for like the last
5361360	5367360	three years because the original actor posted that he was working with behavior
5367360	5368200	on something.
5368440	5371960	Oh, that's, of course. And that would make a lot of sense for,
5372480	5374480	honestly probably doesn't have a survivor with it.
5375360	5376880	And then B. Morrie.
5377440	5379560	Oh man. That'd be great.
5380480	5384680	People have been begging or, or pumpkin head maybe.
5386120	5389120	But I don't know. You know who I think actually should be the killer?
5390280	5391760	Kathleen Turner, a serial mom.
5393280	5397840	Hell yes to that. Hell yes to that. Beverly Sutphin.
5398840	5404160	But it needs, it needs Mink Stole as the cousin or whoever is,
5404160	5408800	or the neighbor that's on the phone. You know, did you just say pussy willows?
5411720	5415360	Anyway. All right. Moving on, moving on. Uh, Loki,
5415640	5418000	you get to take us away from Dead by Daylight. Bring up,
5418080	5420480	let's get back to news from this week. So Loki,
5420480	5421640	what happened in gaming this week?
5422080	5426640	So this week, uh, Daedric or yeah, Daedalic, um,
5426680	5431520	Entertainment had released the game Lord of the Rings
5431560	5434280	Gullum and apparently it was garbage.
5435600	5439000	It's another game and another, another garbage game. Um,
5439040	5441840	there's lots of bugs, lots of, uh,
5441880	5444560	graphic glitches and whatnot. Um,
5444600	5448000	it's got bad UI that looks horrible. Um,
5448800	5453320	it just plays like garbage and yeah, so apparently,
5453440	5457480	oh, and it was a $70 game by the way. Um, so they,
5457480	5461400	of course put out an apology as you do nowadays.
5461440	5465240	As this tradition with the white text on a black background and all the,
5465400	5467800	and all the works. Yep. Yep. Yep. Dear players,
5467800	5472080	we would like to seriously or sincerely apologize for the underwhelming
5472080	5475680	experience many of you had with the Lord of the Rings Gullum upon its release.
5475920	5478840	We acknowledge and deeply regret that the game did not meet your,
5479000	5482880	meet the expectations we set for ourselves for dedicated community. Yeah.
5482880	5487240	But you knew that when you released it. So, uh,
5487280	5490040	we please accept our sincere apologies.
5490200	5494560	Our goal is to, well, let's see, are they going to fix it?
5494920	5498920	Our development team has been working diligently to address bugs and technical
5498920	5500920	issues. Many of you have experienced,
5500920	5504800	we are committed to providing you with patches that will allow you to enjoy the
5504800	5506640	game to its fullest potential. You know,
5506640	5510040	how about you do that before the game comes out? You know, like how about, um,
5510080	5514200	we look at say, tears of the kingdom, you know,
5514200	5517960	they've delayed that game by a year to do extra polishing and stuff,
5517960	5521760	and now you guys are just rushing the stuff out and this isn't the first game.
5521760	5525120	This is like not even the first game within the last month that has done this.
5525120	5525960	So
5528360	5533040	I don't know. I don't know. Stop pre-ordering games. There you go.
5533120	5537120	You can do that. Yeah. Right. Just stop pre-ordering games. Uh,
5537360	5541520	and this is why people do that. So, um, yeah. Um,
5541960	5546600	especially $70 games, like it's like, it runs awful.
5546640	5550800	But like the fact that you're saying, well, we need $70 for this game, $70.
5550800	5554160	Once again, when I hear a $70 price tag for a game,
5554440	5557760	I have a $70 level of expectation for that. And I'm,
5557760	5559120	I'm tired of people saying, well,
5559120	5561920	games were more expensive when I was younger and stuff like that,
5561920	5565560	like on the super Nintendo and stuff like that. Yeah. But the, you,
5565560	5569200	you forget that that's just the sticker out the door sticker.
5569520	5574320	You also forget that there's all the game passes. There's the season passes.
5574520	5578440	There's different battle passes, different DLC.
5578440	5583440	That was not something that was in available when you had $89
5583440	5586840	games at, you know, you retailers there for like Street
5586840	5588120	Fire 2 or something like that.
5588120	5592480	So you have to remember, even though it's just it,
5593560	5595640	it's just not, um,
5597040	5598240	it's just not comfortable.
5598240	5600680	You can't really draw a comparison from that.
5601680	5608680	Actually, when I bought Killer Instinct in 1995 for 60 bucks,
5608680	5611240	that's like 120 bucks today. Yeah.
5612400	5616920	So 70 now is actually
5617200	5619240	less than what I would have spent for that then.
5619240	5622600	And even with DLC and everything,
5622600	5627040	how many games are you going to pay double the money of the original game?
5627040	5629600	Well, OK, never mind. I played Dead by Daylight. Never mind.
5629600	5634840	I'm I'm also like, I'm just sick of studios putting out these types of
5634840	5639320	notices that we see here on stream and that Loki just read for us when, like,
5639600	5642800	they knew the game was of a certain quality when it releases.
5642800	5647440	It was it was these boardroom decisions and investor decisions and,
5647880	5652040	you know, executive decisions to release the game,
5652240	5656400	despite the fact that they know it's not in a great condition.
5657280	5659280	And for once, can I also say this for once?
5659280	5662400	I would like to see a company put out one of these notices
5662600	5666720	that just get to the fucking point, release this. This is it.
5666720	5668080	That's the note we need to see.
5668080	5671240	Sorry, we fucked up that. That's it.
5671240	5675360	Like spare me all of these other words and say that you're really sorry
5675360	5677280	that you fucked up.
5677920	5680040	Yeah, because half the time when they have these roadmaps
5680040	5684560	to fix their games and it's it's always a roadmap like you can clearly see
5684560	5688560	that they needed at least six months to a year's worth of more
5688880	5692840	development time, but they want to recoup some of their money or whatever.
5692840	5696920	But like half the time, they don't even bother with fixing everything
5696920	5699120	that's been broken with it.
5699120	5703640	Or that pushes off like other like DLC plans and stuff that you may have had.
5704040	5705200	So you buy the game.
5705200	5707080	Oh, cool. I'll get this extra content in a month.
5707080	5709800	Oh, well, no, I can't because they screwed up a bunch of stuff
5709800	5711200	when they were developing the game.
5711200	5714520	And now we have to wait another year before we even see any of that.
5715840	5717280	Shane wants to point out in chat,
5717320	5719840	OG Killer Instinct is still worth one hundred and twenty bucks
5719840	5721720	for the soundtrack alone.
5721720	5724760	I mean, I have to have two copies of the soundtrack. Fair.
5725920	5727640	Killer Cuts.
5727640	5731080	Killer Cuts. Yeah, it had like some really weird versions
5731080	5732640	of some of the stuff, though.
5732640	5736040	Dejirama says seventy dollars and still no instruction booklet.
5736520	5738360	Amen to that.
5738360	5740240	Bring those back.
5740440	5742920	All right. Let's see. Let's move on.
5742920	5745440	Oh, another company had a gaming showcase this week.
5745440	5748040	It wasn't PlayStation, though, but it was another studio
5748040	5749680	that makes some games that,
5749680	5752120	you know, I think folks around here probably played a few of these.
5752640	5754640	And that is Marvelous.
5754640	5758680	Marvelous Entertainment did a showcase this week of some games.
5759000	5761680	It was about a 30 minute showcase where they talked about games like
5761960	5765880	Fashion Dreamer, which is a game of the Nintendo Switch fashion game.
5765880	5768680	I believe it's actually been shown in some of the Nintendo directs.
5768680	5771120	So this isn't totally new news.
5771120	5774560	Project Magia, a new frontier is coming out as well.
5774880	5780880	Project Life, which is a brand new IP that is influenced from Japanese RPGs.
5781600	5784040	And then Story of Seasons will continue.
5784040	5785920	There is another installment for Story of Seasons.
5785920	5788000	I know some people were really into that on Switch.
5788240	5790600	So that is going to get a new game as well.
5790760	5795320	Rune Factory getting a spin off project called Project Dragon
5795920	5797440	is going to be coming out as well.
5797440	5800520	And then a confirmation that Rune Factory 6 is underway,
5800520	5803280	but nothing else to say beyond that right now.
5803520	5807440	And the last game they showed, or didn't show as the case may be,
5807640	5813560	was Daemon Demon Cross Machina Titanic Scion.
5814120	5818240	That is being produced by Marvelous's first studio
5818600	5823160	and being helmed by producer Kenichiro Tsurakuta.
5823320	5827200	It is a third person mech shooter series coming out.
5827200	5829600	I don't know if this is a mech game on your radar, Loki,
5829600	5832200	but that is something that you can check out.
5832240	5832880	It is not.
5833080	5833440	All right.
5834880	5837000	OK, so that was Marvelous.
5837160	5839400	DJRomaS in chat says, Ah, Marvelous.
5839600	5842480	They be hitting with some niche anime games at times.
5842480	5844480	That is exactly what these folks are known for.
5844480	5846600	And I know these games are up some of y'all's alley.
5846600	5847920	So that's why I mention it.
5849040	5850520	No One Special in chat says,
5850520	5853320	Does Marvelous Games have any relation to Marvelous Entertainment,
5853520	5855240	who is behind some anime series?
5855240	5858360	And DJRomaS, who would know this answer better than I, says,
5858360	5859320	Yes, same company.
5859640	5860440	So that's good to know.
5861360	5863320	All right, let's move on.
5863320	5866720	Dark Sakura with an interesting update in the preservation realm.
5867920	5871640	Yes, so there is a well,
5871640	5875120	there was a rare Castlevania arcade machine,
5875440	5880360	and it has been preserved so that it can be played on a PC.
5882320	5886680	It is it works with a controller, but you originally,
5886680	5889160	I think, had like a whip controller that you would use.
5889760	5894960	And it's just it was a neat game.
5894960	5897960	But of course, it was Akuma Joe Dracula.
5897960	5900040	The arcade is what the name was.
5900040	5901920	So Demon Castle Dracula.
5903800	5906400	But in progress, there's a
5907360	5910360	Discord server that I think that has the information on it.
5911800	5916480	But I mean, this was like you can play it with a mouse.
5916480	5919640	You play it with a remote to use the whip mechanic.
5920600	5923800	But it is considered the rarest in the series
5924160	5928560	because of just how few of them that they made for Japan and even less for US.
5929480	5932080	So there is a sorry,
5932320	5935560	video has a link to download it.
5935880	5940080	And so what I will do is I will get the YouTube video link
5940080	5941640	and post it in chat.
5943600	5945640	And sorry, some of the audio leaked through there.
5945640	5948240	I try to mute YouTube so that they all stay muted.
5948240	5950720	But sometimes for whatever reason, it resets.
5950840	5952600	Yeah, I'm playing the video live on stream here.
5952600	5956240	So because honestly, I feel like I saw this like one time.
5958240	5958480	Go ahead.
5958480	5960920	It was automatically playing for me and I was telling it to stop.
5960920	5962480	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
5962480	5965680	So but yeah, this is this is definitely like
5965680	5969240	a piece of Castlevania history that most people probably forgot.
5969240	5971520	So that's really cool that they got that working, to be honest.
5972520	5973960	So good for them.
5973960	5978640	All right, let's I'm pretty, pretty happy.
5978640	5980800	Yeah, I want to check that out at some point, for sure.
5981960	5982400	Let's see.
5983400	5986920	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I saw this only once at a convention.
5987720	5989360	Dr. Tzuyu says the music is cool,
5989360	5992040	but from what I understand, sound effects aren't working yet.
5992360	5993160	They'll get there.
5993160	5996080	This reminds me of when they were emulating MAME stuff in the early days,
5996080	6000280	like a lot of stuff took some time to get right and get the
6000320	6002560	get all the sound and stuff, but very interesting.
6003440	6004280	All right.
6004280	6008240	This is kind of some surprising news, Loki, in the industry.
6008240	6010800	This is almost a little weird, I'd say.
6010800	6014880	I feel like this isn't being talked about enough for the volume of what this is.
6015640	6018800	So apparently and it's still very vague, too,
6018800	6021360	because we don't know why partnership was with.
6021720	6026040	But apparently the Embracer group said that a two billion dollar
6026040	6029760	partnership deal that they had with some other mysterious company
6029960	6034240	has fallen apart now as of this week.
6034240	6036960	And so apparently the collapse of the mega deal,
6036960	6040200	the partner, which has not been revealed, was expected.
6040720	6043040	Embracer said they had a verbal commitment in October
6043040	6046240	and described negotiations as taking far longer than expected.
6046760	6048520	Their shares were down 40 percent.
6048520	6053120	And of course, you know, they're they're not happy about that.
6057000	6059160	They said it's been a rough night.
6059160	6061600	But hey, this is business.
6061600	6063000	So cool.
6063000	6066600	There's I mean, there's I'm curious to see what that was about.
6066840	6068880	Were they looking for an acquisition or something?
6068880	6072760	Like, were they expecting, you know, two billion dollar investment?
6072760	6075680	A two billion dollar investment.
6075760	6079880	That's like this was something major.
6080400	6086040	And the fact that it was being taught, they had a verbal agreement
6086280	6089760	and this mystery company backed out of a verbal agreement.
6089760	6091920	Now, granted, you can do that. It's not a legal agreement.
6092120	6093440	It's not a binding thing.
6093440	6097520	But whatever transpired between the verbal agreement
6097520	6100640	and now whether it was a prototype, I'm assuming there was a prototype
6100640	6103440	of some sort that was come together in a couple of months.
6103600	6107480	And it must have been so bad, at least to the rights holder,
6107680	6112480	that they decided to walk away from a two billion dollar deal like this.
6112760	6115440	I mean, the thing is something of that magnitude.
6115440	6118520	This could have ramifications on Embracer Group that are very bad.
6118920	6121880	And for a studio that's been really trying to build themselves
6121880	6125440	with the portfolio over time and stuff, this this is
6126840	6128200	this is just not good.
6128200	6131600	And the fact that the CEO is being as transparent as this,
6131600	6133840	which is in part a relief,
6134160	6138400	but also like very rarely a side that you hear about in games.
6138400	6140960	I mean, things get canceled all the time.
6141240	6143200	Agreements get broken all the time.
6143200	6145160	I don't know if it's at this stage all the time,
6145360	6148000	but there are things that happen a lot.
6148800	6151040	Something of this magnitude.
6151040	6153400	This is huge.
6153400	6157160	And so it's it's going to have ramifications on Embracer Group's future.
6157360	6164200	And I think we're all dying to know who the fuck stood them up majorly here.
6164840	6168040	And but well, it's going to take time.
6168040	6169440	It will come out eventually.
6169440	6170680	It always does.
6170680	6174040	Somebody on the inside will leak it eventually.
6174040	6176520	But it's going to take some time for that to come out.
6178440	6181560	DJ Rama S says, Wasn't Tomb Raider involved in this deal?
6181560	6182960	No, this is a different deal.
6182960	6184760	But Embracer happens to have Tomb Raider.
6184760	6186640	Yeah, they already own Tomb Raider.
6186640	6189880	So no, it's not involved in that.
6189880	6193680	Yeah, unless it was something about making the games exclusive.
6193680	6197520	I don't think that I don't think they said I think they said the deal was a new game.
6197520	6200800	They were going to be investing in like two billion dollars in a new game,
6200960	6204360	which makes me think it was definitely something on the scope of like an always
6204360	6207840	online, always connected type of stuff or franchise or something.
6207840	6211120	I don't know. Yeah, we'll never know.
6212000	6220520	All right, let's move on to our next story and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
6220520	6225200	But first, I've got this story, which is about, of course, Diablo four is on its way.
6225760	6231040	And Diablo four is doing a partnership again with Kentucky Fried Chicken.
6232520	6236560	And through this promotion, you can get some very special cosmetics.
6236720	6242480	So last time it was entry into the closed beta or whatever, you know, the preorder only beta.
6242800	6250320	This time, the promo period from May 29th, apparently, which is tomorrow.
6250320	6254480	So I'm not hearing if that's finalized yet through July 2nd.
6254480	6260640	But certainly around the time this game comes out, you'll be able to earn five special in-game rewards.
6260840	6263440	They are weapons because there's five classes in the game.
6263440	6270120	So they are five weapons, including things like the Dread Pheasant Slayer for you.
6270120	6272120	Get it? Pheasants, chickens.
6272320	6274080	That's something you can get for your rogue.
6274680	6278640	You can also get the Vessel of the Eleven, which is for your druid.
6278960	6281240	Get it? Eleven herbs and spices.
6281240	6284000	That's stupid.
6284360	6288000	This is colossally stupid, but I kind of love it.
6288000	6291400	No, the best pun, the best pun of them all.
6291600	6296040	Hold on. I'm going to bring this up on the other screen because it's one of those things you have to see it to believe it.
6296040	6297320	All right. You ready? You ready?
6297320	6301320	The best pun of them all, the Foul Reaper.
6303560	6304840	I quit, I'm done by.
6305720	6306320	Logging off.
6307240	6307800	That's awesome.
6308800	6314160	I'm so glad I hate the collab, but I like I like how I like that.
6314160	6314760	They leaned into it.
6314760	6316040	I'm glad. Yeah, exactly.
6316040	6317920	Exactly. They're leaning into it.
6318320	6325960	Now, that said, while while cringy as it is, it's still not up to the magnum opus.
6325960	6328160	That was the cup noodle.
6328480	6337760	It's really, you know, cross Final Fantasy 15 like that was just that's just that's just a level of amazement that we'll never, ever see again in this life.
6338080	6341640	Look, you you all wondered what Intern Drew is up to these days.
6341640	6343040	I'm very glad he got a job.
6345040	6348400	Very glad that he got a job at KFC's marketing department.
6350560	6351320	Side job.
6353000	6356120	Well, I mean, yeah, because he and I are co-workers.
6357000	6358600	Don't ruin the fun. Stop ruining the fun.
6358600	6360480	All right. All right.
6360880	6363880	Well, let's let's have some fun with a classic segment.
6363920	6367960	I don't know what I like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio, but I will let the bump say the rest.
6378160	6385520	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6385920	6388680	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6389840	6393520	All right, DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?
6393520	6395560	While I get the b-roll queued up here.
6396080	6398480	I know you're going to laugh because I did it just for you.
6398520	6405400	I know. Honestly, it was one of those things when you when I saw this, I was like, wait, one of those nights that DarkSakura wasn't here.
6405400	6407280	I never picked this game.
6407440	6408760	How is that possible?
6409560	6413600	Because you must be psycho and have ESPN.
6413880	6415520	I guess. All right.
6415520	6417080	So what is the classic game of the week?
6417640	6420800	It's Diablo. The Diablo.
6421320	6422680	The one and only.
6422920	6425720	Without without a numerical modifier.
6426600	6430880	So Diablo is an action RPG that was developed by
6433280	6436600	developed by Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment.
6436600	6441320	It came out in July 1997 and is the very first in the series.
6441960	6446360	It is set in the kingdom of Konduras in the mortal realm.
6446760	6451880	And you play a hero who works to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror,
6452440	6457560	and then you fight through randomly generated dungeon levels
6457560	6460200	and then go to hell and then you face Diablo.
6462120	6465040	So there were also expansion packs for this.
6465440	6471040	And November the same year by synergistic software came Diablo Hellfire.
6471480	6475880	And then EA did release Diablo for PlayStation.
6478440	6481520	It was also the version was developed by Climax Studio
6481560	6484520	and had direct control of the main character's direction
6484520	6488560	using the PlayStation controller instead of the point and click like the original.
6489160	6492960	There's a Sega Saturn version considered, but never released.
6493800	6497800	It's been up there as considered one of the greatest games of all time.
6497800	6499080	And of course, it's had sequels.
6499080	6503400	Diablo two, Diablo three, and now Diablo four just about to come out.
6503400	6508120	And in 2022, there was a mobile version called Diablo Immortal.
6509120	6515640	Anywho, you in the original, of course, you point and click and go different places.
6515640	6519520	You have actions like casting a spell with your keyboard.
6519520	6524880	You get items, you learn spells, defeat enemies and interact with NPCs.
6525920	6530520	The dungeons, as I said earlier, they are procedurally generated
6530520	6534560	with themes for each level, like a catacomb with long corridors
6534560	6538160	and rooms and caves are more nonlinear.
6539280	6542640	And of course, different items to help you level up.
6543320	6545200	So there are three character classes.
6545200	6547520	You have the warrior, the rogue and the sorcerer,
6547880	6550840	and each have different attributes, of course.
6552200	6557120	And, you know, of course, like the warrior is low magic, but
6558160	6560840	he can't learn the higher spells like the sorcerer can.
6561120	6563600	But he's a hardcore melee guy, you know,
6563600	6567320	and then the rogue is the mid range weapon type person.
6569000	6571800	And then in Hellfire, the monk was added,
6572640	6575120	who is proficient at melee with staff.
6575120	6578200	And later on, we got the bard and the barbarian.
6579320	6581920	They were actually unfinished.
6582760	6585200	And but they were in.
6586520	6590560	The game is hidden characters, and you could enable them with a little bit of hack
6591080	6594200	and you would basically
6594840	6598760	give the rogue and the warrior their abilities.
6600880	6604240	You could get, you know, all kinds of items, white items
6604240	6607320	were normal, blue were magic, gold were unique.
6608440	6612920	Anything that was not one of those, they had to be identified.
6613240	6616800	You got bows, you got blades.
6616840	6621120	You could pay an NPC to have items restored.
6621600	6624160	You know, just all kinds of stuff like that was fairly
6625640	6628000	in depth. And there's multiplayer.
6628320	6631160	So you get to play up to four players.
6631160	6633360	The characters are saved periodically.
6633720	6638320	And you can either be aggressive
6638600	6640560	or play co-op with other players.
6641600	6646480	You would use a modem connection or battle.net back in the day.
6646520	6648520	The old battle.net
6648840	6651680	or IPX network connection.
6652840	6658120	It did not have the anti-cheats that the later characters did.
6658120	6661600	So lots of people altered the characters.
6661600	6664320	And there were lots of trainers out there using the cheat engine.
6666760	6669600	But at any rate, I'm not going to go too much into the story,
6669600	6672160	because honestly, if you haven't played it now, then hey.
6672640	6675720	But it was conceived by David Breivik
6676280	6678920	while they were developing the fighting game Justice League
6678920	6684600	Task Force in 1995 and developed by Japanese studio Sunsoft
6684600	6688560	with two American studios, Condor Games, which became Blizzard North
6689640	6694560	on Sega Genesis and Silicon Snaps for SNES.
6696200	6699520	So basically, he wanted to do a roguelike
6699880	6704320	that had turn-based gameplay, but wanted it to have
6704320	6708000	a quicker enhancement, quicker leveling through it.
6708000	6712280	And so, you know, they also had plenty of influences in it,
6712280	6716720	like Telengard, Legend of Zelda, Doom.
6718320	6724920	And then Diablo was based on Mount Diablo, where Breivik lived.
6727360	6728120	That's pretty cool.
6728120	6730920	Just bring in your influences.
6732120	6735960	The game was conceived originally to be a claymation game,
6735960	6739760	like Clay Fighter, but they went for 3D isometrics instead.
6740640	6746680	So Blizzard acquired Condor Games and named them to Blizzard South.
6747240	6749760	And then there was Blizzard.
6749760	6752240	Sorry, their Irvine location was called Blizzard South
6752240	6754840	and Condor Games was called Blizzard North.
6754840	6758840	And then Blizzard South was at the time working on Warcraft 2.
6760920	6766040	This also, though, led to the development of Battle.net.
6766720	6774160	So to keep going on, the music for Diablo only had six tracks.
6774160	6780000	It was composed by Matt Ilman and the soundtrack was released in 2011.
6780680	6785280	Diablo would normally require the original CD to play,
6785280	6787680	but there are shareware versions out there.
6788880	6794200	It's called Diablo Spawn, and then you could unlock different things.
6794200	6800360	And then finally, of course, there's, I believe,
6801840	6806440	the GOG version that has some enhancements now in 2019.
6808280	6809840	They didn't think it was going to sell great.
6809840	6811480	They thought it would be OK.
6811480	6816920	But because of all the positive press, the estimates actually shut up.
6817280	6822560	Their preorders surpassed 450,000 units.
6823040	6828920	And so their original shipment of 500,000 units
6828920	6831440	had to be staggered so that people could get their copy.
6832200	6837200	It held number one for three months before being displaced
6837200	6841560	by X-Wing versus TIE Fighter, which is another game I probably need to cover.
6842960	6847480	But yeah, I mean, the game was very well received.
6847480	6851800	The 94 out of 100 on Metacritic, which is pretty damn high.
6853720	6855120	Not everyone liked it.
6855120	6860000	Like, IGN gave it a 7.5 out of 10 for the PlayStation version.
6860680	6867320	But the PC version was definitely ranked higher than the PlayStation version.
6868600	6870760	The PlayStation version kind of had its issues, too.
6870760	6873960	Like, I understand why people would rank it lower, for sure.
6875360	6878360	So, like I said, there were
6878360	6882640	expansion packs and Blizzard actually sold the world rights
6882640	6887320	to develop, publish and distribute the console versions to EA in 1996.
6888200	6890600	So that's when, in 1998,
6892240	6895520	the PlayStation version came out that had no online play.
6895960	6898360	It had a two-player co-op mode.
6899280	6902200	But there were new lighting effects, auto-aimings for weapons,
6902200	6905200	an option for increased game speed.
6905200	6909280	And the weird thing is that it doesn't support the PlayStation mouse.
6911160	6916360	There was a PAL release that was dubbed into French and German and Swedish.
6917120	6918640	And then, of course,
6920920	6924760	the 1998 Blizzard Game of the Year collection contained
6924760	6927000	Diablo, StarCraft and Warcraft II.
6928360	6931000	And then the anthology that came out in 2000 included
6931560	6935480	Diablo, StarCraft, StarCraft Brood War, Warcraft II Battle.net Edition.
6936040	6940200	And so, yeah, there's just been like a bajillion releases overall.
6940200	6942320	And then for the 20th anniversary at BlizzCon,
6943280	6945440	this is in 2016,
6945440	6949400	Diablo III would receive a patch called The Darkening of Tristam
6949680	6953600	that recreated the original game with a 16-level dungeon,
6953600	6958040	four main bosses from the 1997 one and special graphic filters,
6958800	6961440	eight directional limited speed like the original.
6962640	6966200	They did a test patch and then the public test realm,
6966200	6968800	and then they had it in there.
6969600	6972720	So you can still get the game on GOG.
6973120	6974240	There's two versions.
6974240	6978120	There's the original 1996 version and a DirectX-based version
6978440	6983480	built in-house by GOG that has extra display and graphical options.
6984040	6988400	So that is your game, Diablo.
6989080	6992640	Great pick, and I really can't state
6993000	6996400	how many hours I lost in college
6997120	6998880	on Battle.net playing this game,
6998880	7000960	because you were talking about some of the multiplayer stuff in there.
7000960	7004440	And this is this is an epic game to be playing on Battle.net,
7004440	7007680	because, you know, this is in the era of like Doom and Quake
7007680	7008760	and those same games are coming out.
7008760	7010400	But I was never good at the first person shooters.
7010400	7012440	But this this is definitely more my jam.
7012440	7016080	But it's it's weird because it's this is a really hard game
7016080	7017440	to go back and play now.
7017440	7022600	Like I've picked it up on GOG and the Diablo III integrations cute.
7022600	7025160	But, you know, it's still Diablo III basically with Diablo levels.
7025400	7028680	But I picked it up on GOG and I tried to go back and play it.
7028680	7030080	And it's it's it's hard.
7030080	7032640	It's even hard to play Diablo II now, honestly.
7034080	7038840	But obviously without it, you know, I think there's so many ARPGs,
7038840	7042920	action based RPGs that owe so much to Diablo that we just you know,
7042920	7045560	we wouldn't we wouldn't have these games without Diablo.
7045560	7048360	So. Yeah, great pick.
7049800	7053160	All right. Of course you do.
7053520	7056400	All right. We're going to get to some rapid fire news
7056400	7057840	and then some world release dates.
7057840	7059520	And then we're going to open it up to you all
7059520	7061400	who might want to participate with the show tonight
7061400	7064280	over on our Discord over at vog network dot com slash discord.
7064280	7065760	Or I'm going to see as well.
7065760	7067320	Maybe we have some tweets tonight.
7067320	7068600	I don't know if we had emails.
7068600	7071120	I don't think I saw any come in, but we'll see.
7071120	7073320	But let's get to the rapid fire news first.
7073360	7074880	Loki. Yeah.
7074880	7078200	So they have a brand new Lego set that's super exciting.
7078200	7080120	It is kind of cool.
7080120	7082960	It is a Pac-Man bar top cabinet.
7082960	7084640	This looks fucking rad.
7084640	7088240	And it's pretty sweet because they actually have like elements
7088240	7092040	on the game of the play field to actually move around
7092040	7093920	when you like turn a crank and stuff.
7095840	7097240	Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.
7097240	7100560	Like this is actually, I think, up to the level of like the Lego
7100560	7102720	and Nintendo Entertainment System that they did.
7103800	7106600	The twenty six hundred one wasn't as great, but this one looks really cool.
7107720	7109520	So that is going to be out.
7109520	7111680	I don't know when it's actually out here.
7112960	7116880	Oh, June 4th.
7116880	7119240	For two hundred and seventy dollars.
7119240	7120640	It looks really cool, I think.
7120640	7126080	I mean, they started that whole sort of live element with the Nintendo.
7126640	7128720	Yeah, so that was pretty cool.
7129520	7130560	Yeah, looks cool.
7130560	7132520	So I have to check it out.
7133880	7136480	And then, of course, so we have Super Mario Advance
7136480	7141720	now joining Nintendo Switch online, so they've added that as well as
7142120	7147680	what was it, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance three and Super Mario World
7148200	7152680	Mario Advance two, which, you know, those are just ports of the other games.
7152680	7157160	So. Cool. All right.
7158200	7160600	I'm excited about that.
7160600	7164680	Yeah. Yeah. Well, for another little
7164760	7168640	teensy bit of news is that the most evil of all Tetris games,
7168680	7171440	which is Tetris, the absolute Grandmaster two plus,
7172760	7176400	it will be showing up on the switch via the Arcade Archives
7176400	7178360	collection starting on June 1st.
7178840	7181040	And yeah, be prepared to cry.
7182800	7185120	It's painful. It is.
7185120	7188880	All right. And I've seen people beat like do tournaments on that.
7188880	7191080	And oh, my God. Well, I mean, just don't blink.
7191160	7193080	It is summer games done quick season.
7193080	7195720	So we have to bring up our old pal Kevin DDR, who,
7196200	7198520	you know, was there a few years doing Grandmaster
7198520	7202160	and showed us all how it was done, for sure.
7202840	7208160	All right. Speaking of summer season, it's also time almost for summer game fest.
7208160	7210320	Of course, we know that without E3,
7210320	7212640	this is kind of going to be one of the press events we are getting.
7213080	7215440	It is going to be, of course, on June 8th.
7215480	7216640	We know all this already.
7216640	7218600	What's the new stuff we're getting this week?
7219240	7224760	Word from Jeff Keighley that the live show will feature three or four things
7224760	7227200	that are, quote, pretty big for this audience.
7228320	7231040	I think that's I think that's living in Vagueville.
7231680	7234600	I think the thought of six.
7234600	7236080	Yeah. Yeah, right.
7236080	7239200	Pretty big is also a very relative thing, right?
7239360	7242760	Like Elden Ring was a huge fucking deal to a lot of people.
7242760	7247280	But there's other people that were like, you know, so I think it's it's very.
7248440	7251200	You know, relative, but I think it's going to
7251960	7254200	I'm excited to see what they come up with, for sure.
7254280	7256440	So. All right.
7258280	7261120	We'll see at the event
7261120	7265320	on June 8th, which is less than two weeks away at this point.
7266760	7270560	Yes, it's going to start ramping up these next few weeks, that's for sure.
7270600	7271600	That's for sure.
7271600	7274000	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some games
7274000	7276400	that are coming out this week.
7276400	7278800	Here we are. We're getting the big releases, right, Loki?
7279360	7281360	Only one of them, though, remember, because the other one's
7281360	7283720	actually two weeks from now.
7283720	7286520	So we have Etrian Odyssey
7286520	7289400	Origins Collection on PC and Nintendo Switch
7289840	7295000	of Company of Heroes three on PlayStation five and Xbox series.
7295800	7300120	Far World Pioneers on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox
7300120	7304840	one, Xbox series, friends versus friends on PC.
7305440	7308960	System Shock on PC. Oh, yeah.
7309000	7312240	That's yeah. That reboot. Yeah. Yeah.
7313240	7317960	We have Gunfire Reborn on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
7318600	7323120	Homebody on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation
7323120	7325920	five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

7340880	7344760	Shantae on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
7345560	7351480	Street Fighter six on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five and Xbox series.
7352080	7357920	And last but not least, we love Katamari Reroll Plus Royal Reverie
7357920	7363200	on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.
7363720	7365680	I forgot you're right.
7365680	7369920	Diablo four is technically two weeks because the early access is this week.
7369920	7371920	So technically, yes, it's two weeks.
7371920	7376520	But, you know, the the crazies like me will be playing it a little early.
7377040	7380520	All right. But I'm sure it look either you're playing
7380720	7383680	Diablo four or you're playing Street Fighter six this weekend.
7383680	7387040	Like it's a big weekend for games or maybe the Katamari rerelease
7387040	7388440	sounds pretty good, too.
7388440	7390560	There's a lot of good stuff in the future.
7390560	7393520	All right. Well, let's travel over to Japan where you have a lot of overlap
7393520	7397440	as well. And we have a week where we have big game releases coming out.
7398000	7401000	We mentioned Marvelous earlier in the show, and they are releasing in Japan
7401000	7404520	this week, Loop eight Summer of Gods on the Switch, which I believe
7404520	7405920	we heard in the US as well.
7405920	7410360	We love Katamari Reroll and Royal Reverie is out this week as well.
7410600	7412960	Reverie, excuse me, is out as well in Japan this week.
7413920	7417800	Eterion Odyssey Origins Collection is also out in Japan this week.
7418040	7422520	And that is in a regular and a limited edition because of course it is.
7423680	7426520	And that is it for Japan on the Switch.
7426520	7428600	But let me take a look at PS5 real quick.
7428760	7431040	Company Heroes three is out on May 30th.
7431320	7435520	That same collection of We Love Katamari is out as well on the PlayStation five.
7435760	7439600	And of course, Street Fighter six also released in Japan
7439600	7442640	this week on the second same day as everywhere else.
7443240	7445800	Speaking of everywhere else, what's going on in Europe? Dark Sakura?
7446760	7448880	Oh, only a few things, really.
7449560	7453320	We've got a killer frequency on the first,
7453320	7456480	and that is for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.
7456880	7458760	And then the others are on the second for Switch.
7458760	7461600	We have We Love Katamari Reroll and Royal Reverie.
7461600	7463520	Try saying that really fast.
7463520	7467520	And then on PlayStation and Xbox, we have Street Fighter six.
7468960	7472160	Something that I actually already have on Steam
7472160	7475520	is coming out later in the month, and that's Aka R.
7476440	7480480	Oh. Yeah, which was originally
7480760	7483840	a failed Atari game like like there was a proto.
7484320	7488080	And then it's getting it has its release on Steam.
7488360	7490800	So interesting. Very, very trippy game.
7491240	7496400	All right. Well, we are about to the close of the show.
7496440	7499040	We'll get some last minute stories here in a little bit.
7499040	7501800	But first, we want to open up the roundtable to all of you.
7502320	7506440	You can call in via our Discord channel in the green room over at vognetwork.com
7506440	7507160	slash discord.
7507160	7510720	We already have somebody in the green room waiting to be on the air.
7510720	7511880	So why don't we bring them in?
7511880	7513760	It's been a few weeks since we've heard from this individual.
7514000	7516560	Hello. You are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7518960	7520520	Hi, it's Fixation Gaze.
7520520	7522280	Hey, Fixation Gaze.
7522280	7524160	May I call you Fixie?
7524160	7527000	Of course. How are you doing tonight, Fixie?
7528000	7528880	Great, great.
7528880	7532560	I just wanted to pop in to talk about something that's kind of important
7532560	7536320	in the realm of video games, but also in the realm of video game movies.
7536640	7538040	Oh, which one?
7538040	7538480	Let's hear it.
7538480	7542720	Hadn't heard much chatter in the Discord about the Iron Lung movie
7542720	7544280	coming out by Mark Fischbach.
7544280	7546240	Well, he's directing and starring in it.
7546240	7549640	If you haven't talked about it yet, we have not.
7549640	7551640	So please enlighten us.
7551640	7554600	OK, so first I'm going to start off with the preface of Iron Lung,
7554600	7556960	which was an indie game done in 2022.
7558320	7562360	It is about basically being in a tiny submarine in an ocean
7562360	7565440	of blood on a moon in a post-apocalyptic world.
7566000	7567560	Oh, I remember that.
7567560	7570280	It was played by the by Mark Fischbach,
7570280	7573560	also known as like his better gamer tag, which is Markiplier.
7574400	7576560	And he immediately fell in love with the game,
7576880	7580840	reached out to the indie developer, which is David.
7580840	7583960	I'm going to butcher this last name.
7584640	7585520	Oh, gosh, where is it?
7585520	7587080	Now I know where I heard it is.
7587080	7588000	I heard this.
7588000	7590520	I heard this is the Markiplier connection.
7590520	7592680	Yeah, Skamansky, I think.
7592680	7594200	Skamansky. Yeah.
7594200	7597520	And so Markiplier recently
7597880	7601280	released a trailer for the movie,
7602240	7605160	which he has already finished filming. Wow.
7606200	7610960	Yeah. And he I'm expecting a lot out of this,
7610960	7614040	considering I don't know if you guys have seen his other work,
7614400	7618360	such as In Space with Markiplier, which almost won him an Emmy.
7618360	7619720	He was Emmy nominated for that.
7620560	7623480	The Death of Markiplier,
7623520	7627520	which was also like his kind of branch out into making this sort of content.
7629120	7631880	But he is now kind of severeing
7631880	7636280	harder into the movie instead of the action adventure
7636280	7641360	sort of click story mode he did, where you could pick different options to go on.
7641800	7646680	But now he is fully immersed into the movie creation,
7647000	7651320	which is one of the passions that he has mentioned for his his newer projects,
7651320	7654920	which I'm super excited to see him make more movies. Hmm.
7655800	7657840	And for the record, if you want the game on Steam,
7657840	7660160	the deluxe edition is under seven bucks.
7660640	7662120	Oh, yeah, it's an incredible game.
7662120	7666720	It's very affordable for the absolute terror it brings.
7668560	7671600	For the fact that Mark played it once and then was like, I need to make a movie.
7672160	7674080	I think it's yeah, I think it's also fascinating
7674120	7676640	how we've gone from like YouTube personality
7676640	7680800	to like now taking on Hollywood, like literally YouTube taking on Hollywood.
7681040	7683920	And I know we've kind of talked about this for for years now,
7683920	7687400	about the hours that people spend watching YouTube or say things like Twitch
7687400	7690280	or other type of content online versus, you know,
7690280	7694440	how much people are watching cable and, you know, movies
7694440	7697600	and streaming services and so forth. This is very interesting to me,
7698200	7700760	this pivot and how he's going to be able to
7701760	7704880	mobilize his audience to support something like that
7704880	7708640	and what kind of profit it can ultimately make versus Hollywood.
7709400	7713360	What's really surprising is he actually has mentioned his issues with Hollywood
7714000	7717880	and with because he he was I mentioned he's Emmy nominated. Right.
7717880	7719280	He went to the red carpet.
7719280	7723280	He was on the red carpet and he commented like not saying it in a narcissistic way,
7723280	7728080	but that nobody talked to him because they didn't care nor knew who he was.
7728440	7731560	He made something that was far longer
7731560	7734800	than a movie in space with Markiplier, if you haven't seen it.
7735320	7739160	It's, you know, a choice game where you can go on several endings
7739160	7742520	through several different like timelines based off of your choices
7742520	7744760	in which video you press, which choices you make.
7746280	7752400	And it was an incredible feat for for acting, for effects.
7752440	7755880	It was like watching a movie that was 10 hours long. Huh.
7756720	7758760	And you could keep it had replayability
7758760	7761440	because you could find a new ending, you could find a secret.
7761720	7763160	It was a whole thing.
7763160	7764560	And it got him Emmy nominated.
7764560	7767880	And nobody cared about this new evolution in movie making.
7768240	7770640	Nobody thought, huh, what if we took this
7770640	7773640	and we made it like an in-depth thing for our movies?
7773760	7776440	What if choices like we could do voting in movie theaters
7776440	7778640	to see how something would end?
7778640	7781760	But instead, they kind of flatlined
7781760	7784880	when it came to actually talking to him or networking with him.
7785200	7789120	And so now he has a lot more passion towards making a movie
7789120	7791040	because he wants that to be recognized.
7791040	7794200	He doesn't want YouTube or Twitch streamers to be sidelined
7794440	7797840	for Hollywood celebrities and directors who are already out there.
7798880	7801200	Number one, everything you're saying about this, though,
7801200	7804680	replaced with Twin Peaks, The Return, and that's how I feel about it.
7804880	7808280	The 10 hour TV show that was a movie based on one long movie,
7808360	7811040	completely snubbed by the Emmys and all that stuff.
7811040	7814400	It was a disgusting robbery of epic proportions.
7814520	7818920	But yeah, but but on a serious note, I admire, you know, I'm going to be honest,
7818920	7821200	I don't follow a lot of the big YouTubers.
7821200	7822560	I'm aware of Markiplier.
7822560	7824520	Everything I've heard about him is that he's one of the good guys.
7824520	7827600	You know, a lot of people seem to be really into him and that he's
7827600	7828640	essentially a director.
7828640	7830640	Yeah. And essentially a pretty nice guy.
7831600	7836600	I love that he is forcing himself into the room because
7837000	7839240	and there's there's a lot of places. I mean,
7840320	7843200	not to get all grandpa, but I'm going to for a minute, you know,
7843200	7846560	think about when podcasting first came, first,
7847080	7851920	think about when podcasting first rolled out and this whole show and how we had
7851920	7856440	to insert ourselves into the conversation because people weren't
7856840	7861120	like willing to take this whole emerging thing seriously, right?
7861280	7864520	Like people don't want to take podcasts seriously because we weren't an
7864520	7867080	established magazine or, you know, things like that. Now,
7867080	7870440	not that I'm trying to put us on the same scale as Markiplier. However,
7870480	7875480	what I am saying is that I have a respect for somebody who is forcing their way
7876280	7880400	into the conversation, whether Hollywood is ready for it or not.
7880520	7882920	I think that's great. And I wish him luck. I really do.
7883720	7888720	Markiplier is a fascinating case study of somebody who has repeatedly made,
7890240	7893000	like, I'm going to say, take for example,
7893000	7896200	another thing that he did was technically like directed and, uh,
7896240	7897680	that was Unus Annus,
7898120	7902400	which a lot of people cast by the wayside until it was way too late because the
7902400	7903720	entirety of Unus Annus,
7903760	7907560	even though he was making one video every single day and he was producing those
7907560	7912000	videos and editing those videos, same day, every day for an entire year.
7912360	7916000	But if you actually read into it, there was a script, there was a story.
7916280	7920040	And sometimes you wouldn't see it cause some videos were like rooted in reality,
7920160	7921400	but it went into a very,
7921400	7926080	very nuanced discussion about death and about leaving your mark and about
7926080	7928680	lasting longer than your life. Like what your,
7928720	7931640	what is your content going to say about you in 40 years when you're gone?
7932120	7936040	And then it was all gone, deleted because of everything eventually is gone.
7936560	7937400	You,
7937520	7941600	even your legacy will be gone someday and that you need to live in the present
7941600	7943440	in the moment and make for yourself.
7943480	7948280	And that was a beautiful thing that people didn't realize until it was way
7948280	7952200	gone. And we are left with only memory of what he did.
7952760	7957760	And that in of itself is another innovation that people are kind of
7957760	7960840	overlooking because they go, Oh, Markiplier, he's one of the big dogs.
7960840	7962160	He just isn't for the money.
7962400	7967320	He is a director and he has been refining his
7967320	7969840	talent for years.
7970120	7974920	And it's now that people are going to finally like recognize that
7974920	7979120	he is, he's a talented director and he is pushing games.
7979120	7982960	He is pushing movies and he's pushing YouTubers. Honestly,
7982960	7987240	he is creating a platform for YouTubers to rise up from just being YouTubers
7987440	7990160	and to being creators that the public respects.
7990760	7992800	Um, I got our chat rooms lighting up.
7992800	7996880	I got to get some of these comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
7997120	7999760	Uh, E3VL says Hollywood is part of a cliche.
8000000	8003120	Prince Peach Fuzz says Hollywood is full of nepotism.
8003480	8007480	Um, SSJ100Matt says James Cameron will do the same thing and everyone will think
8007520	8010640	it was his idea. Ouch. The truth in that comment. Um,
8010680	8015000	DJ Rama S says I've had anime cons reject my press application because they said
8015000	8018280	podcasting isn't a news outlet. And this is, and this is the thing,
8018440	8023440	but I bet they will give press passes to a small newspaper out of a small town
8024320	8028240	in, you know, you name the country or you name the County USA.
8028720	8032040	I'm not trying to use corporate sponsored podcasts.
8032440	8035640	Yeah, exactly. And I'm not trying to shade the,
8035800	8039400	like these newspapers because let's be real, like newspapers and magazines,
8039560	8042920	it's a dying art form. However, my point is,
8042960	8045080	it's a very old school set of criteria.
8045320	8050320	How many people actually into anime fandom are going to read that article on the
8050400	8055400	back page of a newspaper versus the amount of fans that would care about the
8056440	8059640	subject matter that your show reaches. And I would bet your show,
8059640	8060560	as small as it is,
8060680	8064840	reaches more people than some of the newspapers they're giving press passes to.
8065000	8067480	And again, I'm not trying to be shady towards the newspaper,
8067600	8071400	but I am trying to be shady towards these old school ways of thinking.
8072160	8074680	People are scared of podcasts. Honestly,
8074680	8078680	like people are scared because podcasts are independent and that means that
8078680	8080560	they are not, they are not paid for.
8080560	8083960	They are just people who are speaking with a microphone and that's what people
8083960	8087200	are scared of. They want to be able to pay that press off.
8087200	8090080	They don't want to have somebody actually come to their show and be like,
8090080	8091400	so this is the stuff I didn't like.
8091400	8094600	This is the stuff I liked because they want money in the pocket.
8095160	8098240	There's another reason why Pump Up the Volume is one of my favorite movies.
8099320	8103280	That's the reason is, you know, what they were doing with their ham radios,
8103320	8107320	you know, is what we now do with, with our podcasts and our live radio.
8108040	8112400	Oh no, that's, remember Orange Launch Radio is not rooted in podcasting.
8112840	8114240	I think that's a, that's a very, you know,
8114280	8116880	because the show is so old it predates podcasting.
8116880	8119440	I'm sorry to make this topic about us, but it's going to happen.
8119800	8124480	Is that if you think of this show is inspired by long
8124520	8129320	form radio shows, which you rarely hear about anymore. That's why,
8129320	8131040	cause everybody always goes, they, you know,
8131040	8133160	when I introduced the show and talk about it at conventions,
8133160	8135600	I can't tell you how often I hear from other podcasters,
8136040	8140960	you do a two and a half, three hour podcast and every week people listen to that.
8141440	8145640	I'm like, yeah, it might not be 11 D billion people.
8145640	8149200	We might not have the reach of a IGN or something like that,
8149200	8152040	but you know what? There are people that are like, Hey,
8152080	8155960	I'm going to put in my earbuds as I'm doing my work on Monday and you get me
8155960	8160480	through the entire day on Monday. And I love it. And that's, you know,
8160480	8162880	that's why we keep doing what we're doing. You know,
8162880	8165000	maybe we need to evolve, but I don't think so.
8165000	8167440	I love what we're doing to be honest. We've evolved.
8167440	8171240	I love Orange Launch Radio. Honestly, since Dark Separat showed it off me.
8172880	8175040	And I hope I'm a listener for a very long time.
8175120	8177680	Thank you. I hope you are too. Well, and, and, and.
8178160	8180160	For killing all of us in dead by daylight, right?
8184960	8188960	Don't apologize. Do it again. I told you how we met, right? We had a bad bill.
8189360	8193840	Oh, there was something to be in the bad. And I didn't know.
8194080	8194920	That's right.
8194920	8198720	He was going around behind me and Gwen making noises and fast vaulting and shit.
8198800	8202240	And so we talked to Fixie about it afterwards.
8202240	8203680	And then Fixie watched the stream,
8203680	8206800	which I also believe was when we all fell in love with get bonked, bitch.
8208680	8210560	Yeah, it was hilarious.
8210560	8213960	I didn't realize because when you're streaming one sided as a killer,
8213960	8216560	you're not thinking of what the other person is saying.
8217000	8220000	So I go back and I watch it. I was like, oh God, that bill is actually.
8220480	8223560	Oh, wait, they said something as they bonked me. That's hilarious.
8225960	8229000	And I absolutely fell in love with Dark Sakura and the group,
8229000	8232560	and apparently I've been adopted as their sibling. So that is.
8233360	8235680	I have adopted Fixie.
8236240	8237080	Fixie.
8237080	8240440	Although from what I heard about your age earlier in the show,
8240440	8242960	you might actually be the niece, nephew.
8244120	8245760	What?
8245760	8247600	Rob.
8247600	8248760	What?
8249120	8250160	Nope.
8253480	8254320	Nope.
8254960	8257920	I guess you could call me next gen Orange Lounge radio.
8258200	8260280	Oh, love that. Love that.
8260280	8263640	It's going to be you and Loki's kids.
8263640	8264160	That's it.
8264160	8267040	Instead of Orange Lounge, we're going to have you be the Tangerine Dream.
8267480	8268480	Oh, God.
8269360	8272040	That reminds me too much of
8272040	8274680	the Jamba Juice smoothie, the Orange Dream Machine.
8274960	8279640	Orange Lounge Radio 2.0 or not New Coke, but New Orange Lounge.
8279800	8280320	There you go.
8280320	8282760	You have to call in and talk about food one day.
8283400	8287560	It has to be the the Star Trek font going next gen.
8288520	8290480	The next generation. I love that.
8290480	8291320	I love that.
8291320	8292920	To make it all edgy.
8292920	8294720	Anyway, I won't take any more of your time.
8294720	8298560	I just wanted to pop in and talk about a project that's near and dear to me
8298920	8300800	and also just needs to be talked about more.
8300800	8302320	So I'll hop on out.
8302320	8303840	It was wonderful talking with you.
8303840	8305480	It was wonderful to have you here.
8305480	8307800	Fixie in a little bit anyway, right?
8307800	8308560	Hmm.
8308560	8310720	We get to hear more from you in a little bit, though, right?
8311680	8313720	Yeah, there's definitely going to be a stream.
8313720	8315880	All right. Well, thank you so much, Fixie.
8315880	8317120	Oh, go ahead.
8317600	8319120	I'm rebranding my avatar.
8319120	8322480	So if people pop on over to soccer or my streams,
8322800	8324280	they're going to see something new.
8324280	8325520	All right. Sounds good.
8325520	8326960	We'll be keeping an eye out after the show here,
8326960	8328520	which will wrap up in just a few minutes.
8328520	8330480	We're going to sneak in one more call here before we do.
8330480	8331760	But have a good one, Fixie.
8331760	8333360	Thanks so much for the call.
8333360	8336400	You too, Rob. All right. Bye bye.
8336400	8338400	I always appreciate when they take a moment to call into the show.
8338400	8340520	It's always pleasant to hear from them.
8340520	8342040	Fixie is a quality person.
8342040	8345160	Yeah, let's move to another call because somebody else
8345160	8347600	just popped in the green room and I want to take this call, too.
8347600	8350200	So hi there. You are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8351080	8352720	The one and only D.J.
8352720	8355080	Ron Mez, how is everybody doing tonight?
8355080	8357360	I'm fabulous now that you're here, Rama.
8357360	8359720	It's great to have you here.
8360640	8361840	Rob, what?
8361840	8363840	My brother in Christ.
8365400	8367520	Wow. I haven't been called that ever.
8368840	8373320	Jamie, my sister in Christ, Loki, my other brother in Christ.
8373320	8378040	Let me tell you, I don't know what you know about Jamie's personal life, but
8378040	8384200	how about how about we just say mishpocha?
8385320	8386600	Fair enough.
8386600	8390600	Now, there's no secret that
8391400	8396360	M.A. Jam Session is loosely based off of Orange Lounge Radio.
8396360	8400080	OK, and I know it's a cool show.
8400080	8404040	Imitation is the finest form of flattery.
8404040	8405560	Thank you so much.
8405560	8406880	I like what Fixie said.
8406960	8408680	From another console.
8409960	8411480	Oh, my God.
8411480	8417120	So part of the reason why I started podcasting is because I have
8418240	8421080	I can't write. I'm terrible with writing.
8421640	8423680	Jamie has read my emails.
8423680	8426280	She has given me grief for it.
8426360	8428960	I've had a manager that has given me grief for it.
8428960	8433680	I feel this one hundred percent.
8434680	8437320	In high school, I had to take the regents exams.
8437440	8442520	I double talked my way through the essays just so I could pass.
8442840	8448000	And I would write con reports for other websites, including my own.
8448320	8451760	And it got to I just can't do this.
8452200	8454760	I just feel like I'm repeating myself over and over.
8455000	8458800	And I realize if I write notes and I talk about these notes
8459160	8460760	and I get feedback.
8460760	8463680	This is DJ Rama S taking me to church.
8463960	8468480	This is DJ Rama S taking me to church because I understand him
8468640	8471480	one hundred percent when he says he can't write.
8471680	8473920	Neither can I.
8473920	8475880	I have no idea what you're talking about.
8476720	8480600	Preach. You you sit in the pew and listen.
8482120	8484040	Play my grandma. She was the English major.
8484040	8491080	So once I got this going, I'm like, we're going to go to conventions,
8491080	8492080	we're going to keep this up.
8492080	8494720	I would sit there and I felt these applications.
8495000	8498880	They wanted to know about the last three or four con reports.
8498880	8502440	I'm just like, shit, I put the links in
8502560	8505920	and I would tell them exactly what I was going to do for some conventions.
8505920	8509080	I'm a one man band running around taking pictures, doing interviews,
8509080	8510400	all this and all that.
8510400	8513240	And I would tell them we do this on a weekly podcast.
8513560	8515400	And they will come back and say, well,
8516480	8520120	we don't know what podcasting is, so it's not a viable news outlet.
8520120	8522840	So therefore, your press application has been rejected.
8522840	8525200	And I'm just like, are you kidding me right now?
8527240	8530480	I would say you provide live entertainment.
8531920	8534360	With syndicated publishing.
8535840	8537800	I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to write that down.
8538000	8540040	I swear to I swear to God.
8540040	8541160	Oh, how you praise it.
8541160	8544680	I swear to God, we're going to just start a Vogue network newspaper.
8544680	8547800	And then that way we can all say we work for a newspaper called Vogue Network.
8547800	8553600	And that will print one issue every month or one one copy of an issue every month.
8553600	8557040	So that way it's done and put it in a in a bin somewhere.
8557440	8560320	And that's it. And then they'll be like newspapers.
8560320	8561480	Those are so old.
8561480	8563520	Now, you know, it's about Rob.
8565160	8567440	Honestly, that would be really good for my resume.
8568480	8569680	I love Fixies comment.
8569680	8571560	We could do a zine. Fuck yes.
8571560	8573400	We're taking it back to 97.
8573400	8574960	We're going to do a fucking zine.
8574960	8578720	I love it. We're going to staple them and do them on a mimeograph.
8581160	8584440	Don't mind me, I am getting my coffee because, you know, I had to talk,
8584440	8586400	you know, I had to talk.
8586400	8588720	Spill that tea, Rama, spill it.
8589440	8593120	Well, you say if we do the e-zine, we have to save a PDF
8593120	8595640	version on the website so we can have an archive.
8595800	8596920	Yeah, yeah.
8596920	8598440	By the way, Rama, I have to ask.
8598440	8600880	I have to have you do something for me, but I'll tell you offline
8600880	8603480	because it involves going to a Jewish deli in Crown Heights.
8603480	8605080	I got you.
8605080	8609720	I can't help but wonder, is this is this related to why I just got a con report
8609720	8611240	for publication at VOG Network?
8611240	8614760	Because I feel like it might be along those lines.
8614800	8616520	Yes. Yes.
8616520	8618720	That's why we built it.
8618720	8621480	Great. Can't wait to push the publish button on it.
8621480	8622920	Yes, I. Yeah.
8622920	8629560	You know, it's like there are some conventions they are like,
8629560	8630560	oh, I see what you do.
8630560	8633680	We'll give you a press pass and others are like, yeah, no.
8633880	8637480	I've had people like I have never heard of you or I've been told, well,
8637520	8639200	here's what you got to do.
8639200	8641600	Your Alexa ranking has to be a certain amount.
8641600	8643760	And I'm just like, are you kidding me?
8643760	8646280	I'm going to fucking barf.
8646800	8649240	You know what? I want some money right here.
8649280	8652240	Does it look like I have Alexa ranking money in my pocket? OK.
8652560	8656760	No, like some rankings on my Internet in the year twenty twenty three.
8657280	8661480	What the fuck is your Internet still powered by a fourteen four hundred
8661480	8664280	baud modem? Like, get the fuck out of here.
8664320	8667080	Alexa Ray. Is Alexa even still a thing?
8667120	8670720	Listen, listen, me and Alexa are on a first name basis.
8670720	8672080	So it's fine. I'm sorry.
8672080	8675040	Was my GeoCities address not good enough for you?
8675760	8680480	Fuck. There is another reason why press outlets like mine
8680600	8682160	do not like read pop. OK.
8682840	8685160	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
8687320	8691600	There's a reason why I stopped putting in applications.
8691640	8695400	Oh, OK. I actually want you to say, well, your site's not popular enough,
8695400	8697840	so we're going to reject your press pass.
8697840	8699200	Well, you couldn't pull off E3.
8699200	8703440	So there the man said, the man said, that is all.
8704360	8706160	The man said it.
8707760	8710120	There's no love lost between me and read pop.
8710240	8714080	As I've told people who keep asking me every year, are you going to Comic-Con?
8714320	8717120	Absolutely not. It is too crowded for me.
8717280	8718680	Somebody hit my camera.
8718680	8720720	These hands are ready to eat for everyone.
8725200	8727240	I understand they have some anime stuff.
8727480	8730760	It was the one year they joined forces with Anime Expo
8730760	8733400	and it was a giant cluster.
8733680	8736680	OK. All right.
8736680	8740160	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry to all the smart speakers
8740160	8745120	I've been setting off, apparently, by saying the A-L-E-X-A word over and over.
8745120	8747800	Sorry, Pod Culture and others.
8749160	8753840	I'm going to go down this rabbit hole and and I apologize for nothing.
8754920	8759240	Amistad was a cakewalk compared to how and read pop
8759240	8761280	and AX pulled off their anime weekend.
8761280	8762840	OK, it was like that.
8762840	8770480	But now that we're at a point where everybody's doing a podcast
8770760	8773760	and people are saying this, it's getting oversaturated.
8773760	8777280	I'm like, it's only oversaturated if you listen to too many podcasts.
8777520	8779360	I do mine. I listen to Yo Guy.
8779360	8780880	I listen to a lot of people.
8780880	8782800	I still have time to listen to music and do what I got to do.
8783360	8784640	Everybody wants to do something.
8784640	8786000	So you roll with it.
8786000	8790440	I tell people, if you want to do a podcast, just do it.
8790800	8793480	Don't listen to somebody who says you just do it.
8793480	8794560	You never know.
8795920	8800280	As long as you have the love in your heart for it, just have at it.
8800280	8801240	Here's the thing.
8802120	8804440	You ready? Get your tea, because I'm going to spill some.
8804600	8805080	Get it.
8805080	8807120	Oh, sucky sucky now.
8807120	8810360	This is some spicy hot tea, because you fucking ready for this?
8810360	8811560	I'm going to say it like it is.
8811560	8816600	When people say that the market is saturated by podcasts,
8816840	8820640	what they really mean is that the market is saturated by white men in
8820640	8822760	their basement doing a podcast.
8823520	8828280	There is nothing wrong with trying to bring more diverse perspectives
8828280	8833800	and opinions to the table and enabling more people to get their words
8833800	8837560	out there, because it is through that diversity and through those
8837560	8841640	other lenses that we are going to get the criticism that a lot of
8841640	8846160	these old fart ways so desperately need when it comes to these
8846160	8850720	conventions and these other things that have been built around a
8850720	8855440	culture that only listens to these particular voices.
8856760	8861520	Sip on that, because that's what saturation, that's what it is.
8862160	8865960	That is some bitter vinegar that they all need to drink.
8866920	8869400	Let me just say this, and I'm going to go about my way.
8869400	8873400	I'm going to finish my nice, nice roast of coffee here.
8874400	8879800	I find it amusing that there are some conventions that will not accept
8880320	8886280	my site or certain others, but yet we're the ones that are doing everything.
8886720	8889280	I got one person doing interviews.
8889280	8891000	I got one person actually writing the reports.
8891000	8896520	I got one person doing photography and we after the end of the weekend,
8896520	8897360	what do we do?
8897360	8899480	We have something ready for you on Tuesday.
8899600	8902600	A week later, we got the com report for you.
8902840	8905840	A few weeks, a couple of weeks later, the photos are edited and
8905840	8907800	ready to share with the world.
8908160	8910680	I don't see anybody else.
8910680	8914440	And as many cons I have gone to and they talk about, oh, we only have
8914440	8917880	limited amount of press passes, sometimes I find that I'm the only one
8917880	8920080	that's actually there doing stuff, OK?
8922600	8924760	But it's OK because I love what I do.
8925320	8932640	And that's that and that and that is how OLR has lasted 21 years next month.
8933200	8934160	And now we know.
8935360	8937480	And knowing is half the battle.
8937920	8942240	On that note, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap this shit up for the night.
8943880	8948880	Do you have any final thoughts or would you like to plug your, you know, little
8948880	8951640	underground show that a few cons have heard of?
8952560	8956560	Yes, I would like everybody, if they're free Tuesday nights around nine o'clock,
8956560	8960440	to swing through vognetwork.com and animejamsession.com to check out
8960440	8965280	anime jam session on Twitch and you'll hear me talk about how I should be, I
8965280	8970480	should not be buying any more figurines and stuff like that because I had four of
8970480	8976080	them arrive at my porch this week and I've kind of started running out of room.
8976080	8979440	I just spent three hours clearing out my closet to make space.
8981760	8983640	And I just got a new Nightcrawler figure.
8985280	8990680	Girl, girl, I'm going to turn all the lights on if you can see it.
8991080	8994120	I have, there's a bunch of figurines right there.
8994320	8997160	There's a bunch more behind the door over here.
8997960	8999680	There's a bunch of pops up there.
9001760	9004320	I should swing the camera around so you should see it.
9005480	9006120	Do you see this?
9006600	9007360	I see it.
9007560	9008000	I see it.
9008000	9009120	Definitely like the board game.
9009360	9012720	Mario, Mario Kondo is about to punch you both in the face.
9012720	9013520	Just saying.
9013760	9016040	Oh, Rob, I'm so proud of you for saying her name, right?
9016680	9018320	But I also went out and got this.
9018880	9023440	I got an awesome PDR shirt at the collection and I realized I've run out
9023440	9025800	of space in the drawer to put it away.
9026680	9029840	Actually in my defense, it's because I've been cleaning out other rooms
9029840	9032520	that a bunch of shit's in here, including like some of my gym equipment.
9032520	9032960	So.
9034960	9037680	If you all could stop comparing sizes for a minute.
9037680	9042120	Excuse me while I whip this joke.
9046120	9047360	Rob, I'm sorry.
9047360	9049000	I did not know your size, King.
9049040	9049840	I am so sorry.
9051280	9053360	Don't, don't you forget it.
9053640	9054160	All right.
9055960	9057440	Get off my program.
9058040	9058720	I'm done.
9058920	9059680	I'm done.
9059680	9061320	I can't with you.
9061440	9062480	I cannot.
9063040	9063800	But I love you.
9063920	9064720	Love you, Mean It.
9065080	9065400	All right.
9065400	9066160	Take care of my friend.
9066160	9066880	Till next time.
9068360	9075120	The one and only DJ Roma S from Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays as a part of the
9075120	9078880	Voice of Geeks network, but on their own Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash
9078920	9080720	Anime Jam Session.
9081880	9082240	Whoo.
9082240	9082680	All right.
9082680	9089640	Uh, oh, I had a quick, quick question from Twitter that came through and here it
9089640	9093840	is, uh, from Garth the Wolf over, uh, to our Twitter at OLR.
9094840	9095760	We love Garth Wolf.
9096000	9100520	For all three hosts, name one Final Fantasy series.
9100520	9101800	Oh, your favorite topic, Jamie.
9102000	9106040	Name one Final Fantasy series song that resonates with you.
9107760	9112760	Um, um, I really like Kiss Me Goodbye.
9114280	9120280	I mean, it's just, I love the Angela Aki, like in a really, really, I just
9120280	9121600	love her voice so much.
9122280	9126760	Um, and I'm sad that she hasn't put on any new music, but I know that she
9126760	9134040	went in, uh, to study music in the U S but her, her voice is amazing.
9134080	9139600	If you want to hear a really good song by her, listen to Tagami and, um, which
9139600	9144720	means letter, and it's about her talking to her younger self, um, and of
9144720	9145920	course you want to find translation.
9145920	9150600	She has covered so many bands in, um, in Japanese.
9151560	9155160	Uh, she did, she did, we are the champions in Japanese.
9155680	9161840	Um, but her voice is probably one of my favorite singing voices ever.
9161840	9163440	And Kiss Me Goodbye is such a good song.
9163680	9167560	It was actually the song that got her charted.
9170240	9172400	Uh, I remember, oh, go ahead.
9172400	9172640	Sorry.
9172960	9178640	I just remember, uh, reading an interview with her where she went to go see, um, I
9178640	9183600	think it was Anna Tsuchiya at the Budokan and she was like, I want to be up there
9183600	9184160	one day.
9184520	9189880	And then right after that, she got the thing for, uh, Squenix to, to do the
9189880	9190200	song.
9191120	9192640	And a year later she was playing at the Budokan.
9194640	9196440	Um, Loki, do you have an answer for this?
9197160	9199120	Otherworld from Final Fantasy X.
9199840	9201160	Ah, good pick.
9201960	9203480	Um, I have two answers for this.
9203480	9207840	I would say probably above and beyond Terra's theme from Final Fantasy VI.
9208200	9213320	Um, there's just something epic about the way that game opens with the mech in the
9213320	9213880	snow.
9214120	9218360	And there's just, I, the way they kind of weave that theme throughout the game
9218360	9218880	itself.
9218880	9222560	And, you know, just the iconic, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
9222560	9226800	I think it's just, it's, it's just so powerful.
9226800	9229040	That's just such a powerful, meaningful song.
9229920	9233200	A more contemporary answer I would actually throw out there, I'm going to go
9233200	9233880	to 14.
9233880	9239000	I have to, but I would say the song To the Edge, which is the fight that you do
9239000	9244040	against the Warrior of Light, um, uh, that you fight as part of the, um, uh,
9244080	9245840	Shadowbringers expansion fights.
9245840	9252200	The reason why I say that song, when you find out the story behind it, how, um,
9253200	9257920	Soken, the main, main composer you may or may not recall was, was battling
9257920	9262320	cancer, uh, and was actually in the hospital when he wrote that song.
9262960	9270040	And it gives a whole nother layer and depth to that, that is so powerful, um,
9270080	9274680	that I would highly, even if you don't enjoy 14, you don't go watch a video of
9274680	9278120	this fight, the Warrior of Light fight, or To the Edge is the name of the song.
9278520	9282000	It's just, I mean, it doesn't really relate to any other Final Fantasy game,
9282000	9285040	besides who you're fighting, obviously, which is a really cool interpretation of
9285040	9288880	the original Final Fantasy I Warrior of Light, but just when you hear the full
9288880	9292320	backstory behind that, it's powerful.
9292520	9301160	Um, and just, just goes to show how Soken, not that, not that, um, Nobuimatsu,
9301160	9306840	my God, brain fart, not that Uematsu can ever be replaced, but if there must be a
9306840	9311920	successor, Soken is a hundred percent worthy of that.
9312640	9313480	He's so good.
9313480	9315200	May I actually make an addition, then?
9315280	9316000	Yeah, please.
9316000	9318400	All, all of the music outside of Uldah.
9318800	9319600	Mmm.
9321120	9321720	Yeah, I just-
9321720	9324720	I could sit and listen to that for hours.
9324760	9325440	The work-
9325440	9326680	Because I haven't listened to it for hours.
9326840	9335440	The work that Soken has done on Final Fantasy XIV, history will look back on
9335440	9342320	it and realize what an impactful fucking guy he was on, on gaming music.
9342480	9346480	I mean, just the guy from Mario Tennis went on to did this, do this.
9346480	9347360	It's incredible.
9347600	9348200	It's incredible.
9348440	9349840	Anyway, those are my answers, Garth.
9350360	9350720	All right.
9351520	9355040	On that note, um, Dark Soccer, I think you were going to bow out just a little early
9355040	9357320	because I know you wanted to do something before you start your stream, so-
9357320	9358480	Yeah, I want to make a sandwich.
9358520	9359120	I'm hungry.
9359160	9359760	No worries.
9359800	9363160	Before I check in with Loki on any final stories, then let me go to you with any
9363160	9365240	final thoughts you might have before I wrap it up tonight.
9366000	9367400	Are they Final Fantasy thoughts?
9367600	9368480	If you want them to be.
9369280	9370600	Uh, no, I don't really have any.
9370880	9371360	Oh yeah.
9371640	9377400	Um, I, uh, I, I really am kind of getting obsessed with ballet.
9378000	9382000	Like, I feel awesome.
9382560	9382960	Good.
9383000	9383840	And insane.
9385400	9392240	I found muscles that I didn't know were in my body and all of them are right
9392240	9395200	around my hip and my knees and they're like, Hey, guess what?
9395200	9402320	You old, but, but I, uh, I, I, I fall in love with it more and more every day.
9402320	9409120	And I, I feel like I can call myself a dancer, even if I'm, I never liked dancing
9409120	9414920	before, unless it was DDR, you remember me saying that ballet has become my DDR.
9416080	9416560	All right.
9417080	9419560	Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go have a good stream tonight.
9420400	9420800	All right.
9420880	9422400	Have fun storming the castle.
9422800	9423400	We'll try.
9423640	9424000	All right.
9424920	9425760	Think it'll work.
9426360	9427320	It'll take a miracle.
9427320	9427800	There you go.
9428360	9428800	Bye.
9429960	9431920	See, I knew she'd be pissed if I didn't give her the follow-up line.
9432120	9432440	All right.
9432440	9433320	Uh, low key.
9433320	9434120	Let me check in real quick.
9434120	9436400	Any, um, um, last minute stories for us.
9436440	9436560	Yeah.
9436600	9437600	Yes, we do have one.
9437960	9443480	Uh, so this is not much of a surprise, but apparently, uh, Nintendo was asked
9443480	9450320	valve to, uh, remove the dolphin emulator off of their, uh, storefront.
9450440	9453640	I want to say, I'm sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but there was some very
9453680	9457280	interesting discussion on this, on our discord server over at vod network.com
9457280	9457880	slash discord.
9458040	9461320	And the reason why I say that is that there was chat about that the press may
9461320	9466480	not be framing this accurately because it sounds like valve actually contacted
9466480	9472160	Nintendo saying, um, thoughts and Nintendo replied saying, and I'm
9472160	9475960	paraphrasing, we don't like it, get rid of it type of thing.
9475960	9479160	So it actually sounds like, even though it sounds like, oh, Nintendo's lawyers
9479160	9483080	strike again, it sounds like valve may have actually initiated.
9483120	9486720	Like, um, are you, you mad bro?
9486840	9489840	Like, it seems like valve may have initiated that conversation, which I
9489840	9492760	understand, you know, as much as we want to say, ah, fuck valve for doing that.
9492760	9497240	I understand why from a legal perspective, they're probably going, you know what, if
9497240	9500680	we don't go to the lawyers, the lawyers are going to come to us.
9500840	9503960	So I do understand from that perspective, but anyway, I'm sorry, Loki, go ahead.
9503960	9506520	I just wanted to get that because I did see folks talking about that on discord.
9506680	9510160	I do want you all to know, even if I don't always respond to every message, I read
9510160	9511080	discord all the time.
9511080	9511760	So anyway,
9512640	9517320	according to the dolphin developers, they said that we've been notified by valve, um,
9517360	9522120	that the Nintendo has issued a cease and desist, fighting the DMCA against the
9522120	9527160	dolphins steam page and had removed dolphin from steam until the matter is
9527160	9527720	settled.
9528200	9532600	Um, they're currently investigating their options and we'll have a more in depth
9532600	9533760	response in their future.
9533880	9536160	It may be just like some of the stuff that's on there.
9536440	9541520	Uh, but according to, they said the legal notice is they accused dolphin of using
9541520	9546560	cryptographic keys without Nintendo's authorization and decrypting ROMs at, or
9546560	9548240	immediately before runtime.
9548440	9548840	Wow.
9549680	9550560	So, all right.
9551360	9553560	Well, we'll just have to use all the other ways to get that.
9555320	9558240	It's not like you can't get that thing on a steam deck if you don't know if you, if
9558240	9559920	you know there's ways to do it anyway.
9560240	9560600	All right.
9560920	9563320	Thank you all so much for listening to orange launch radio this week.
9563320	9565400	Thank you for downloading the show or listening to us live.
9565400	9568520	However you consume the show, I'm sure you heard it earlier in the show.
9569440	9573880	It's, it's hard to stick out sometimes and it's hard to, um, you know, go against
9573880	9576080	all these very large corporate podcasts.
9576280	9579880	So we appreciate you for finding us on our little portion of the internet and I
9579880	9580960	hope you enjoyed what you heard.
9581240	9584760	Um, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are
9584760	9586080	the show where every gamer has a voice.
9586080	9587880	We need more voices to put out there on air.
9588120	9591960	Um, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever you heard
9591960	9595480	this podcast, they go an awful long way and we really appreciate it all.
9595800	9598560	Um, so with all of that, let's get final thoughts for the night.
9598600	9600320	Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.
9601120	9607080	Well, thought is, uh, I'm hopefully going to keep, I need to keep a pace to get all
9607080	9609040	my stuff done for the end of the season.
9609040	9611480	So, but yeah, the next episode is going to be cool.
9612080	9613000	All right, awesome.
9613400	9617920	Um, my final thought is I had a great time at my work conference and there's stuff I
9617960	9622520	learned there that I feel like I can apply to the stuff I do here and throughout my,
9622600	9624640	the rest of my life as well, which is always a great feeling.
9625000	9630240	Um, and, um, number two, Diablo four comes out this week and I'm fucking excited as
9630240	9632440	somebody who's been a Diablo fan for a very long time.
9632440	9635320	So it is going to be a great gaming week.
9635600	9640160	The big summer of gaming begins right now and it is exciting.
9640200	9643560	Oh, and third, I'm taking a third final thought cause we missed last week.
9643760	9648920	Um, you'll notice tonight I am wearing my pride, uh, wristband here on my Apple watch.
9649080	9654040	That is because pride month, as far as I'm concerned, has officially been extended from
9654040	9655920	Memorial day to the 4th of July.
9655920	9656280	That's right.
9656280	9661240	There's been an extension on pride month because of all the fuckery, these assholes
9661240	9662600	out there keep putting us through.
9662600	9668600	It is very clear that one month is not enough for us to say we're here, we're queer.
9668720	9669720	Get used to it.
9670280	9672760	And on that note, I'm going to roll the credits.
9672840	9674160	Have a wonderful week, everybody.
9674160	9674680	We'll see you.
9674720	9675160	Good night.
9702760	9704160	No, they were all still.
