00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No single gaming news outlet took down the behemoth that was E3, but it was the era of streaming that enabled publishers to cut out the middleman. Just like the internet revolutionized direct sales, right? Now we call online shopping, Amazon. Who will be the replacement for E3? PAX already was, because E3 was never for the people. Any takers on bets for PAX Southwest? This is the Kick'em While They're Down update, now it's time to go.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you this week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining us tonight as she is every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers. Hello. Hello. How are you? I have a little bit of a headache, but I'm okay. Okay. Is that why you're not on cam? Because I wasn't sure. Oh, shit. Hold on. Yeah, no worries. You're good. Well, let me also quickly say hello. We got it. Let me also quickly say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you? I'm fine. What is

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the game playing behind you tonight? Dude, was it Dodonpachi? Oh, yeah. Okay. All right. I'm almost positive. I'm almost positive DarkSakura has done that as a classic game of the week at some point in the history of this program, which is tonight- I think I've done Dodonpachi. I don't know that I've done Dodonpachi. Gotta check the wiki. Did you know this show has its own wiki? And I I've rarely touched it. I maybe edited one thing that had to do with like an episode numbering or

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,000
something. But yeah, it's pretty awesome. I actually always forget the URL now. Because to me, it's orangelonsradio.wiki.com. But at some point fandom.wiki. So maybe it's .fandom.com or something. But it's there. And thanks to those that do that. I also am calling out Loki's video because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. That's VOG network. Nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So there, that's that's everything. Here we are tonight with episode number 960 of our show. Not going to be here next week. Sorry, I know it's a very random week, but my day job is getting in the way. So you know, it's- I know, but you know, the the show that, you know, pays the bill so I can- or excuse me, the job that pays the bill so I can do this show. A little more important with that. So we will be back in two weeks, but we're gonna make it an extra good show tonight, even though I feel like there's far

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:30,000
less news this week because I think everybody's been busy playing Zelda. I don't know if y'all are aware, but a little game came out on Friday called Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. It is the sequel to Zelda Breath of the Wild, which of course was a launch title on the Nintendo Switch as it came out in tandem with the Wii U, where the game originally started development for and years ago, Nintendo teased this sequel that finally was released to the masses.

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This last Friday, not that plot details in the game wasn't leaked before that. But we don't talk about that under fear of being slapped in the face by Nintendo and their lawyers. That all being said, I have a feeling here on the panel, we haven't touched a lot of Zelda, but I'm going to get into that in a minute. So Dark Sakura, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom launched. Have you had a chance to check it out? Or what's your what's your hype level for it? Tell us about where your head's at with Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
We have it and I immediately went to go spoil things for myself because that's what I do.

10
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,840
Hey, if you do it, no one else can do it for you. It's taken the power away.

11
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,200
The reason why I like doing it myself is because there's certain aspects of things that I would be

12
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,480
interested in. And seeing it happen in real time doesn't really take away any of the excitement for

13
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,640
me. It's a little bit different, you know, if I was just going to watch a complete and total playthrough

14
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,200
of the whole thing. But I've been going and looking for like specific things, you know. And so

15
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,280
those specifics are like the little things that I kind of use as like a mental checkpoint for

16
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,240
what I want to get to in a game. And it motivates me to keep from getting the really quick game

17
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,600
burnout that I tend to get. Gotcha. Which is why I'm still playing Dead by Daylight because I'm

18
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,360
trying to do achievements and stuff. Oh, I'm playing with my friends. I love my friends.

19
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:11,840
Or as Shay says, I love you. But yeah, I'm happy with some story aspects to it and the attention

20
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:20,080
given to certain people. In chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Tiger Claw asks,

21
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,040
with a title like that, were people in tears playing it? Fess up chat. Who in chat has cried

22
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,480
playing Tears of the Kid? I've cried playing a video game. Of course I have. You know,

23
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,480
there's video games that are very emotional. Oh, the end of the first disc of Lost Odyssey.

24
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:43,600
I thought I was going to barf. The ending of Mass Effect 3, especially the extended cut DLC.

25
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,480
I thought I was going to throw up from crying.

26
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,520
Hey, there's a reason that I always do the destroy ending.

27
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,240
Misha in chat is the first to fess up saying me. And for totes different reasons, which I can't

28
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,720
say because spoilerinos. So I respect that. Loki, what about you? I think we were talking a little

29
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,840
bit before the show. Your kids are old enough now where they kind of get into Zelda games.

30
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,000
So your kids will play Tears of the Kid. My youngest, he's into Zelda. He's been

31
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,720
playing a ton, so he is looking forward to it. And he's been playing it constantly since Friday

32
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,840
when he got home from school. So he likes it. Yeah. There were people that took off work on

33
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,000
Friday legit to play the game. Of course. I mean, I've done it. In fact, I'm actually on the fence.

34
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,800
I might try to take a day for Final Fantasy 16 because it is right around my birthday,

35
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,960
so I can take like a birthday day off, but we'll see. We'll see. Yeah. Yeah. I have not

36
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,720
played it yet. I got to be honest. I'm having a little difficulty swallowing the $70 price tag.

37
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:00,720
Although I saw a great life hack online, which is if you buy $100 of eShop credit at Costco,

38
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,400
it actually only costs $90. And it's the same thing with PlayStation. Because I did that to

39
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,000
renew my sub, and I think I've used the rest of the money to put towards theater them.

40
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,000
So you can do that. And then you use the $100 credit that you only pay $90 for to then get

41
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,760
the two-in-one game deal that they have for Nintendo Switch Online members. So you're

42
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,560
getting two games for $90. So that makes the... Yeah, you can be ordered on Amazon and get their

43
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,080
pre-order bonus. What were they offering for pre-order bonus? They have some deal where you'd

44
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,960
get a certain amount percentage off for doing your orders on their site.

45
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,240
Okay. Alan Alchemy, my husband's in chat. Hello. Saying some Costcos also just have the digital

46
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,360
code for it for $59. So that's... Because usually when you think Costco, you don't think sales on

47
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,480
one item. You think like, oh, I've got to buy Zelda and Mario and Kirby and take it both discount.

48
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,880
The package that Zelda comes in though is like the size of one of those large toilet paper

49
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,840
packages. So there's that. I guess.

50
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:24,480
But aside from that, it's basically the same. Interesting. All right. So I have not gotten

51
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,920
a chance to get around and play the game. Obviously, the $70 price tag. I know the game

52
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,360
is probably worth it, but I'm going to be honest. There's a lot of other games coming out the next

53
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,920
couple of months that I know I'm going to be super into. And I just didn't get into

54
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,160
Breath of the Wild as much. And that's not to say... And I want to go on record here.

55
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm not a hater. I understand why people love these games. I understand why this is the game

56
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,000
of the year for people. Me, I am so bleep and frustrated at the weapon degradation system in

57
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,400
these games that it kind of takes me out of the experience a little bit. Like, I...

58
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,920
Yeah, I'm just... So I'll get it at some point.

59
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,160
You know, it's basically the combat, the weapon degradation, except it's more...

60
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,920
There are more steps and it doesn't really combat weapon degradation.

61
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,840
You know, for me, it's just like, I don't... I'm sorry. A $70 game doesn't run at 20 FPS sometimes.

62
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh, is that what we're talking about is performance issues with the game?

63
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,160
Of course, it's on the Switch. I mean, yeah, there's going to be performance problems,

64
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,560
but we're going to give it a pass because it's Zelda. But like,

65
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,960
the hardware is not meant to run this. And that's fine because I guarantee that this is another Wii U

66
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,520
Switch type of scenario where it's like, oh, yeah, we're releasing it now and it runs okay.

67
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,320
But then the Switch 2, when it comes out next year, oh, it's going to run really good on that.

68
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,840
Like, they're going to sell it to you again for another $70. Oh, well, maybe $60 if you bought

69
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,160
the Switch version, assuming that, you know, the digital storefronts talk to each other because,

70
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
you know, internet's so complicated nowadays.

71
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,160
Honestly, I think, Loki, you bring up a point that does kind of frustrate me with Nintendo

72
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,880
in general. Like, I'm going to be honest, like, although I understand a good game does not have

73
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,200
to be 4K, 60 frames a second. And so again, I don't shit on Zelda for these reasons. But there

74
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,480
is a part of me that's a little bit like, like, sometimes I understand the people that are like,

75
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,280
I wish Sony would buy Nintendo and put Zelda on the PS5. Like, honestly, sometimes they have a

76
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,160
point. Like, the emulators run it better. Just saying that's that's a weird scenario that game

77
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,680
first thought that your current console is being emulated already, and that it's being emulated

78
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,680
better than the actual console while the console is out. That's like, that tells you how underpowered

79
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,480
the Switch is. I would really I would be let me put it this way, I would be more excited about

80
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
Zelda. Here's what will get me to buy the new Zelda right away. If they put out an

81
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
higher power switch next year, as a lot of the rumors are swirling around if there's going to

82
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,200
be a higher power switch because it's so obvious. These last gen Switch games are like low end PC

83
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,400
specs. You know, like we're playing these games to the minimum qualifications. It's weird.

84
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,160
There was there was comments from some screen manufacturer that's making screens for it already.

85
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,800
So like that there's something coming.

86
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,160
That's that is going to get me to get Zelda honestly. That that's going to do it. I you know,

87
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,120
and maybe it's because this is important too. And I know this separates me from a lot of people out

88
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,320
there. A lot of people love the Switch because they can take the games portable and play in

89
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,920
handheld. And I've always said on this show, I rarely do the handheld gaming thing rarely when

90
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,160
it comes to consoles, because I'm always playing the phone game AR stuff. That's no problem for me.

91
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,800
But I don't play a lot of portable games. I play my Switch docked like 95% of the time. And I think

92
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,280
that's very important if you're trying to put yourself in my shoes about why didn't Rob get

93
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,360
Zelda the first day that it all kind of comes into that I think a little bit.

94
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,720
Anyway, knowing that we here did not spend our entire weekend playing Zelda like many of you out

95
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,600
there. This is the show where every gamer has a voice. So earlier today, I went to ye old social

96
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,000
media and our Twitter account over at twitter.com slash O L R. And I actually asked I said, Hey,

97
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,760
listen, those of you that have been playing Tears of the Kingdom this weekend, what are your

98
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,640
thoughts so far? So let's hear from some of our listeners over on Twitter. Michigan said, to be

99
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,800
H I honestly love this one over Breath of the Wild because there's so many new things in it that

100
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
weren't in Breath of the Wild. It's a bit harder for me than Breath of the Wild, but I'm still

101
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,480
having fun. And the environments are so cool and the things you can do as well. Dr. Tzuyu said so

102
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,040
far it feels like a great expansion to everything they built in Breath of the Wild. The Mrs. and I

103
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
have barely scratched the surface, but playing around with the new abilities has been fun.

104
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,680
Definitely raised the difficulty in a second quest kind of way though, at least it feels like

105
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,720
it. Oh, that's interesting. I didn't realize it was supposed to be a harder game. Mike Deft tweeted

106
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,120
us saying I've been playing it on and off and having to relearn how everything works and

107
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,600
exploring a new but familiar world has been like experiencing Breath of the Wild all over again

108
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,480
for the first time. And I'm loving it. The hype is real and it's here. Flaco Jones, haven't heard

109
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,320
from Flaco in a while, hope you're doing well, tweeted us and said I've just scratched the

110
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,680
surface, but it's great so far. The story really takes off in the opening minutes and I can't wait

111
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,240
to learn more. I have heard the opening to the game is really good for what it's worth. It looks

112
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,000
like it goes deep into Hyrule lore and I am here for that. I'm hearing similar sentiments quite a

113
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,760
bit. Dungeon Buster tweeted us saying enjoying it so far, the build system is sometimes like

114
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,880
and attached a gif from Kamen Rider of a girl with a bazooka firing at what appears to be a group of

115
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,000
mobsters. So there you go. That's the best way. That's my best translation of that gift to radio,

116
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,040
but those of you on Twitch can see it. Okay. Here's an interesting comment from our pal,

117
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,600
Shane, who says I am bored. I'm not terribly far just outside the intro area and it just feels like

118
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,320
more Breath of the Wild. Good for people who love Breath of the Wild, but I don't feel the same

119
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,200
excitement each time I've started it up that I felt was Zelda games pre-Breath of the Wild.

120
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,600
I don't feel the rush to see it's to its end. So that's the first comment of a maybe not glowingly

121
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,280
positive that we've heard here on the show. This is also interesting. I'm going to come back to

122
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,440
something that's set in here later, actually. And we also have a name I haven't heard before,

123
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,080
so thanks so much for tweeting us. Cashew LeCate says absolutely incredible, filled with surprises

124
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,600
and nostalgic callbacks. Story feels even more engaging than Breath of the Wild. Abilities,

125
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,120
though I was skeptical of some at first, are all amazing so far. I was hoping the user icon

126
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,680
was actually the picture of a cat named Cashew, but it appears to be some other type of art.

127
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,160
We also had one more tweet here from Straying Will. I don't think I've seen this name either,

128
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,360
so hello, hello. Says I had never cursed as many times at a single shrine in my entire life. So

129
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,480
yeah, it's been good. So for the people who love to bang their head against the wall of difficulty

130
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,520
on some of those, people are enjoying it. So again, it sounds like most of what we're

131
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,240
hearing there is pretty positive, but there's that one outlier, right? So this is interesting

132
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,440
because go to some of the reviews for this game. Now look, I don't always love to put stock in

133
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,960
Metacritic, but I have to use it here to make an example of something here. So let's go back to

134
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,360
looking at this game on Metacritic. Let's be real, this is an amazing Metacritic score. No

135
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,360
matter how you feel about these type of websites, to see a game score this high with 87 positive

136
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:10,960
reviews and one mixed review and zero negative reviews is pretty astounding. User reviews don't

137
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,560
matter. We're not paying attention to user reviews because they're always terrible on these sites,

138
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,280
even though they are for the most part, for what it's worth, leaning overwhelmingly positive as

139
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,720
well with some outliers in the negative. But I want to focus on this for a minute,

140
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,560
because this one outlet that dared to do a six out of 10 review on the game, or this might actually

141
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,120
be a three star review, I'd have to take a look, was getting a lot of flack on social media this

142
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,600
week for daring to give it a score that's not 10 out of 10. I hear the sigh, Loki. What's on your

143
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,680
mind with this? It's just, it's just stupid. And I saw, yeah, I saw the Kotaku article calling them

144
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,040
out later. Oh, look, they didn't raise the point. There was a call out article. I didn't know that.

145
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's a call out article. It says, Oh God, I'm trying to find it now.

146
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,040
But yeah, I was just surprised. Like, I'm like, really? Like, really, you're calling out another,

147
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,240
another outlet because they didn't rate it a perfect score. I'm sorry, people have opinions

148
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,400
about games, there may not rate it a perfect score. And the same thing happened last time. I

149
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,880
remember it was that James Stephanie Sterling was having issues because they gave it a seven out of

150
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,800
10. And everyone's like, how dare you not give it a 10 out of 10. Like, he's like, they were just

151
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,800
like, I like the game, but I just didn't think it was a 10 out of 10. Like, I don't know, like,

152
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,200
what's wrong with people? And they will like attack these people? Because how dare you not

153
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,360
like the game as much as I like the game? Right? Right. I don't know.

154
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,520
How dare you not validate my opinions, even though I have no value in my own opinions?

155
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,320
It's ridiculous. And to be honest, like, I think the coverage on Kotaku is more of like,

156
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,880
it was a slow news week. I mean, how many Breath of the Wild stories were there? Yeah.

157
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,080
And we we also know that particular website has a little bit of a beef with Nintendo that,

158
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,400
you know, and some of it really shows in some of what they're, you know, and I think I don't know

159
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
what they're getting clicks out of it. They're trying to get clicks out of it. But we all know

160
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,760
that that website has some history with Nintendo that some would question the professionalism of

161
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,840
how they're dealing with it. But I'm sure from their perspective, they are just saying,

162
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,280
if Nintendo wants us to shut up, they'll make an agreement with us again. They'll get us to sign

163
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,120
an NDA again by giving us what we used to have. That's that's what they're doing from their

164
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,000
perspective. But anyway, I digress a little bit. I want to go back to this website because it was

165
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,600
interesting because I saw a comment on social media about this website. The website's name is

166
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:52,640
Gfinity. And I saw an interesting comment that said some no name website gave this a six out of

167
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,320
ten to just for the clickbait. And I actually. I kind of that struck a nerve with me, actually,

168
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,840
and maybe it's because I've heard this podcast referred to before as a no name podcast.

169
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,040
But again, what makes this individual's review any different from your review?

170
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:19,760
Why does this individual in this website's review? Why is this any better or worse from what other

171
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,800
websites that do get lots of clicks such as the ones we were just talking about do? And I want to

172
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm also curious, too, because I actually read the review and there was a part of me that was like,

173
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm going to be honest, I was like, I don't know if this sounds like a six out of ten.

174
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,920
It sounds like a seven out of ten, though, because for the most part, it did point out a lot of like

175
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,320
the things about it. But there was a section of this I thought was very interesting towards the

176
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,240
end, especially in light of some things we were just talking about. I'm going to quote from this

177
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,840
review. Again, the website is Gfinityesports.com. I'm sad to say that The Legend of Zelda Tears of

178
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,240
the Kingdom just isn't worth the wait for me personally. It takes too much from the one title

179
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,200
in the series, it took me years to finish, and does too little to reinvigorate the classic Zelda

180
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,520
magic back into its reused world. So this sounds a little bit like somebody who misses some of the

181
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,240
older Zelda games. I can identify with that. I love Zelda games that are more in line with,

182
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,960
Super Nintendo and Nintendo and the things we saw in that era. So I could understand maybe

183
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,680
that frustration there. It builds upon the divisive foundations of Breath of the Wild

184
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,800
to a point where those who love the open world adventure will genuinely find a lot to like.

185
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,200
But it really is just more of the same to the point where I suspect even the loyalists

186
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,400
will be a little downtrodden as they slowly tread the same path around Hyrule. If the original open

187
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
world adventure left you feeling a little deflated, Tears of the Kingdom is unlikely

188
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,120
to convince you that it's the best way forward for the franchise. Now if you weren't aware,

189
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,800
a lot of these comments are coming from the fact that apparently they did reuse the Breath of the

190
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,360
Wild map for Tears of the Kingdom. However, there's a lot, I mean it makes it sound like

191
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,960
they copy pasted it, no no no, far from that. There's a whole underground area, there's

192
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,760
obviously these new things such as the classic dungeons that didn't exist before. So it would

193
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,680
not be fair to say it's the same world, but it is definitely a familiar world, I think is a fair

194
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:27,440
way to put it. And by the way, this comment, did you notice, very similar to our outlier comment.

195
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,040
It just feels like more Breath of the Wild. Good for people who love Breath of the Wild,

196
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,680
but I don't feel the same excitement. I've started it up that I felt with Zelda games pre-Breath of

197
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,160
the Wild, our pal Shane pretty much said the exact same thing the 6 out of 10 review does.

198
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,440
Does this make Shane's opinion any less relevant?

199
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,680
Food for thought. Look, and at the end of the day, and again I know I'm spending a lot of time

200
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:05,600
highlighting one borderline like 6, 7 out of 10 review here, it doesn't impact the fact that this

201
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,880
game has one of the highest Metacritic scores I have ever seen, and it certainly doesn't impact

202
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,920
the fact that those of you out there who love the game are still gonna love this game. And you're

203
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,560
probably sitting there kicking like, there's much more than Breath of the Wild and there's all these

204
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,120
different things and the durability system is better with a few, that's fine. That's great.

205
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,760
Because I realize there's a lot of games I play, say Final Fantasy XIV, that a lot of people don't

206
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,240
want to get into for a variety of reasons. And that's okay. People's like or dislike of that

207
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:46,800
doesn't necessarily lessen my love of that game. To me, I kind of have the whole feeling of like,

208
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,200
you know, when you're like, you're eating a sandwich and it's got stuff you love

209
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,000
on and someone's like, I don't like that. Like, so? What does that have to do with me enjoying

210
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,680
my sandwich? I literally didn't need to know that. I didn't need you being negative about

211
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:16,640
something that I enjoy. And vice versa. If I didn't enjoy something and someone around me

212
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,280
is like, oh, I loved this thing, unless that thing is gonna like hurt them, then I'll be like, cool,

213
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,480
glad you like it. What did you like about it? But in reading this review, I didn't get that

214
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,320
like, that's the tone coming out of it. Like, I felt they raised their case as to why the game

215
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,200
wasn't for them. And that, you know, if they are to be a gaming journalism website with review,

216
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,920
I mean, it's not like they've never reviewed a game before. You know, this was just one person's

217
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,680
opinion on it that happens to line up pretty accurately with the opinion of one of our

218
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,120
listeners. So there's people out there that feel this way. And that's, that's okay. But yeah, it

219
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,040
should, it doesn't mean, yeah, it doesn't mean you have to go around shouting on social media,

220
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:04,560
Zelda sucks. And if you play it, you suck. Like, okay, just go, go kick a rock, you know?

221
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:14,080
Anyway. Let's see. Shane is in chat or Shad Leland says, yeah, it's not like a bad game,

222
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,400
but I'm not, or it's not feeling like it's a game for me emphasis so far. So I wouldn't rate it

223
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,400
highly at all. Right. That's okay. Yeah. And it's okay to have like a discussion about it,

224
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,840
but certainly don't put people down for having a difference of opinion. Yeah. You know, it's using

225
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:44,080
my same analogy. You know, it's something like, Oh man, I really, I really like a carrot cake,

226
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,360
but I don't like it with raisins, which is true. Raisins to me are gross. And I'll, you know,

227
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,200
and I'm like, I like this, like, how dare you not eat it without raisins in it. Raisins are

228
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,480
a fundamental part of the recipe. No. Are you going to tell me, oh, I don't,

229
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,000
anyway, but you see my point. Yeah. Or you can tell me that a 10 out of 10 game

230
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,960
doesn't let you pet the dog. I'm sorry. That is not a 10 out of 10 game.

231
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,360
Uh, E3VL actually, when, when Jamie was making the raisin and carrot cake analogy,

232
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,760
E3VL said exactly where my mind went to as well. Pineapple on pizza. People make this out to be

233
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,400
like, it's the biggest debate of the 21st century is does pineapple belong on pizza.

234
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
And I was going on in the eighties. I've been asked this question before,

235
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,440
do you like pineapple on pizza? And you know, my answer to that question is

236
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,720
it's, it's not what I usually order, but I don't, I think Hawaiian pizza is a perfectly acceptable,

237
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,200
delicious pizza, but I'm not going to die on this hill. If you don't like it, don't eat it more for

238
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,840
me like that. And that is how I feel about pineapple on pizza. Like pineapple goes on

239
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,680
pizza. If you like pineapple on pizza, I usually don't like the other stuff that comes with pizzas

240
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,800
that have pineapple on them. Oh, they have a chain of pizza places over by us that has broccoli on

241
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,720
pizza. Yeah, that's actually, I've had broccoli on pizza before I had broccoli on pizza. And corn

242
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,600
with, Oh no, no. That's actually a Japanese thing is having corn on pizza. Yeah. I like potato on

243
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:27,280
pizza. Yeah. See, and yeah. And of course now the chat room is scrolling faster than it has all

244
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:33,360
night now that I brought up pineapple on pizza. Y'all, y'all are you, are you considering the

245
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,000
point I'm trying to make here? And dark soccer was trying to get to. For the record, I'm going

246
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,280
to say this about Chicago style pizza, just to refute SSJ 100, Matt. Okay. If pizza is a kind of

247
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:57,840
pie, then a Chicago style pizza is a type of meat pie. So technically it is considered a pie and not

248
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,640
a casserole because it uses a standing crust for its edges. I don't give a fuck what anyone calls

249
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,200
it. I'm going to eat it all because I love it. You can call it whatever you want. As long as it is

250
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:20,400
going in my mouth, the pizza. But that is just me saying that it does not count as a casserole

251
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,080
because it has the standing crust like a typical meat pie. The end. Anyway. I don't know. To me,

252
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,600
it feels like a pizza is less a pie, more of something you cut similar to a pie in slices.

253
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,640
I mean, that's just like almost like cutting a cake into slices. So pizza is a cake, I guess.

254
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,920
But like. I regret bringing up. I regret the food discussion coming up on this show again. All

255
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:51,600
right. Let me get into this other thing that I thought was very, you know, cute. That was.

256
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,080
New York style pizza isn't original pizza either.

257
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,600
Can I please get away from pizza?

258
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,200
There is only one original style of pizza. You have to have a margarita and that's it.

259
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,520
Are we done? All right. I want to talk about.

260
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,720
Let me mean it, Ranma.

261
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,520
I want to talk about some social media commentary from Xbox and PlayStation on the release of

262
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,680
Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, because no matter how you feel about the game,

263
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,440
it's a huge release. I recognize that people took the day off work for it.

264
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,080
There's a lot of folks really into it. And Microsoft and Sony took a minute to actually

265
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,360
acknowledge the release of Tears of the Kingdom, where the official Xbox Twitter account said,

266
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,200
Congrats, Nintendo on Tears of the Kingdom. We'd like to see the little handshake, good game

267
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,320
type of behavior, right? And the official PlayStation account actually tweeted,

268
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,000
Have fun up there Hylians with a little cloud emoji. It's not necessarily using the game's

269
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,800
name in full or who even made it, but we all know what they're talking about, whatever.

270
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,440
So it's nice to see a little bit of that. We've come a long way from the Genesis does what

271
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Nintendon't days of the console wars of yesteryear. So if all these folks can get along,

272
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,560
why can't all of you when it comes to the console wars?

273
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,360
Xbox and PlayStation, that's fine. I'd love to hear what their opinions are,

274
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,000
but I'm more interested in what Wendy's had to say about it.

275
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,200
What did Wendy say about it? Did they make a McNugget panorama with

276
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,200
items from the game or something like that? I don't know.

277
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,040
I hope they said anything.

278
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,600
I'm sure Tears of the Kingdom will come up again later in the show. In fact, I know it will.

279
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,840
However, one thing I have to point out because I was sent this multiple times on social media

280
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,840
with some type of label that said, Oh, look, the time to penis in this game was less than 10

281
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:00,080
seconds. And sure enough, somebody out there made this creation using the crafting system

282
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,440
in Tears of the Kingdom that looked like a little person with a giant, you know what,

283
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,560
that was set on fire that looked like a sparkler on the 4th of July.

284
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,640
I don't believe it's against terms of service to use the anatomical name.

285
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,320
Penis. Penis, penis, penis.

286
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,040
I was going to say you could also, if you want to be tasteful, use phallus.

287
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,280
But anyway, I was sent that gift multiple times.

288
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,240
Yeah, they don't have it. Wendy said nothing.

289
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,280
Now you know what getting unsolicited dick pics is like.

290
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,120
The other thing I've seen is Koroks being crucified and then launched into space with

291
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,560
rockets. So that's a thing.

292
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,800
Oh, Def says I'm confusing what Wendy's does on social media with Arby's. Arby's is the one that

293
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,760
makes the complicated dioramas and stuff. Okay, my bad. My bad.

294
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
I love that Arby's does that.

295
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,000
I know it's the only good thing about Arby's because I sure as hell won't eat their food.

296
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,680
All right. Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks. Since we haven't been playing Zelda,

297
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,360
let's talk a little bit about what we have been playing in a segment called

298
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,320
How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

299
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:24,960
It was. I played Midnight Suns, of course, because I love that game. I'm on my second

300
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,680
playthrough. I'm doing a light playthrough. And then I played, of course, some Dead by Daylight

301
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:41,360
with my friends. Had a good old time. And we tamed killers. I'm very proud of Fixie for having

302
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:51,680
tamed the Myers. Well done. Anyway, and of course, we got Tears of the Kingdom.

303
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,720
We're going to be opening that up. Played some World Cup soccer. We let Beatles go,

304
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,280
it's being sold to someone else. But our Weird Al will be here before too long. Yeah.

305
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,640
I was gonna say you're probably sad to see the machine go, but happy to see the money

306
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:22,400
come in to spend on new machine. I also played a little bit of Parodius for Famicom, a little bit.

307
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,040
Yeah, just been like, throwing things in here and there. I am bringing my retro night back,

308
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:39,040
but I kind of think I'm going to do Cult of the Lamb first, just so I can start a new game and

309
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,120
play through the DLC and get everybody in who wants to be in. And then I may go back to Star

310
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Ocean finally. All right. Well, we'll go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?

311
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,680
It was most, I think I actually know it was all Minecraft. So I'm doing a lot of Minecraft stuff.

312
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:06,080
Put out an episode on Tuesday. We had our Channel 64 stream day yesterday. So I streamed in the

313
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,720
morning, and then did some errands of the family and then came back and streamed again in the

314
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,920
afternoon for my 1k subscribers thing. So we looked at some of the older worlds that I've

315
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,960
been in. So congrats on that, by the way, browse around. Yeah, thank you. Browse around like

316
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,760
different bases and stuff that other people made and stuff that I've made kind of rush through

317
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,040
that quite a bit. My wife was like staring at me like, have you played enough today?

318
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,360
It was. So, yeah, the bridge that a little bit. I've been busy, like actually doing more

319
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,880
Minecraft stuff right now because I'm trying to get another episode out here pretty soon.

320
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,920
So, yeah, there's that. And then, oh, yeah, it's fun. Still trying to get the 4000 watch hours.

321
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,400
It's going backwards now because it's year to date. And so I keep watching the number go down,

322
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,200
which is weird, though, because like, I'm getting like, quite a bit watch hours that I've seen,

323
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
but the numbers going down. So I don't know if they're just not counting that or like,

324
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,000
what the case may be there. Try not to obsess and just focus on putting out the content and

325
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,960
you'll get there. I know you will. You're talented. Yeah, it's gonna take a while.

326
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm just impatient. That's all. So yeah, so I've been just working on that stuff. I got

327
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,640
the road masters in game now, at least some of them. So I actually I made a Minecraft mod. So

328
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,760
that was fun. So I did that. And we tell us more about this. You made a Minecraft mod.

329
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,480
Yeah, I made a Minecraft mod. So basically, I built a mod for fabric that will bring my

330
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:48,320
the models I had commissioned into the game. So they use what's called the single gecko live,

331
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:56,960
which is a animation, like a framework, I guess that allows you to do like different

332
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,360
animation things that are more complicated than just the Minecraft animations, because

333
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,280
Minecraft animations are kind of all math based. It's basically like, at least it used to be I

334
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,880
think they changed that recently with 119. But it used to be like you had said, Okay, this is going

335
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,960
to hinge back and forth type of thing, or it will spin around. And that's really all you could do is

336
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,200
make stuff swing back and forth or spin around. I think maybe I'll move stuff around as well. But

337
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,720
like it was very like basic animations, because it was have to be all stored. Like on like the

338
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,600
entities and everything. So they had it very basic. So this basically allows you to do a

339
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,320
traditional animation where you have keyframes, and you can do really complex stuff with it. So

340
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,320
the guy that I commissioned to do the so I had one person commissioned the designs for, you know,

341
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,360
my robot masters, and I had another guy take those designs and put them into 3d models. So

342
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,520
we have the first three done. And so I brought those into game now. So now I have a fabric mod

343
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,360
that I'm allowed to basically bring those in now. And then I use another mod called taters ends to

344
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,960
make them walk around. And one of them axolotl woman, she actually has voice lines, I used AI

345
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,640
to create voice lines for just because I, you know, I didn't want to pay yet another person

346
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,040
for voice lines right now. That'll come later. I kind of paid for voice lines, but it gets

347
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,920
expensive as it is already considering that only I really see it. I was gonna say this is why we

348
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,360
need to get you to monetization. So you could recoup some of the money that you're spending

349
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:42,640
on all this stuff. It's Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. Is it labor? I only noticed it. So there's

350
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,560
that. And then, oh, yeah. So yeah, this last episode, I built Moby from I think maybe a two,

351
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,240
three, I can't remember which being a man, Moby was a giant whale giant with the propeller fires

352
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,160
the torpedoes are not only torpedoes, but it's like missiles out of its back. So I built that,

353
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,440
which was huge. And then these giant cooling towers. And I have more cooling towers to build.

354
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,840
And then I moved guardians, which are these kind of fish things that have spikes on them and that

355
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:20,800
shoot lasers up their eyes. And so I moved those over to guardian man's area during the live stream

356
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,120
and actually named them after the people that were in chat during the like the whole live stream day.

357
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:34,560
So there's a bunch of those in there now, which is fun. And yeah, so it's been busy. So yeah,

358
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,400
right before we came on the show now I was moving an elder guardian, which is a real pain to move.

359
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,880
So that'll be that'll be the next episode briefly. Then I got to get into the brand new robot master,

360
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,760
which is golem man who's going to be a it's all like a stone quarry type of thing that building

361
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,240
so much smaller area hopefully get not that knocked out because we don't have a lot of time

362
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,200
left in the season for us. You know, no one to like give it away. But like, we're only estimating

363
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,280
like a few more few more months worth of time that we want to stay to like, finish up everything.

364
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,480
And so I'm trying to like rush to get everything done. And so I have to keep this like breakneck

365
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,960
pace right now to get everything because stupid me over scoped again. Oh, no, I do this all the time.

366
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,760
You think I'd learn by now. But it's fun. It looks cool. Everyone's always impressed when they come

367
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,760
to my base. Nice. So yep. All right. Cool. Let's see going to my gaming week. So some of the same

368
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,000
stuff I've been playing in the last couple weeks. Did one night of streaming stranger paradise

369
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,520
final fantasy origin this week. So continuing on that. And I played a little bit off stream

370
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,480
doing some side quests. So I'm ready to continue in the main quest. I don't think I have a ton more

371
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,040
to go in that game, maybe like three more streams, maybe, maybe more, maybe less. But I think we'll

372
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,320
get through that game pretty soon. So I've been playing more of that theater them as well. And

373
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,960
in fact, I think the next time I play theater them because I've been playing enough off stream

374
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,680
and knocking out the songs, I think next time I stream it, which ought to be Wednesday, because

375
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,400
I believe we get, if I remember the calendar right, I think we get our first Chrono Trigger

376
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,200
songs this Wednesday, I believe is slated as the DLC. Oh, I'm sorry. It may be Chrono Cross. It's

377
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,120
Chrono Pack. So it might be the Chrono Cross. Somebody is going to have to help me clarify in

378
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,160
chat what's coming this week, but I know some Chrono music is coming this week on Wednesday,

379
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:38,480
but I will also finally get the trophy for having played every song once. That is literally hundreds

380
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,800
of songs. So I'll finally get that on stream on Wednesday, probably. And then, you know,

381
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,720
I'll probably continue with trying to get some quests done and leveling. I finally got my first

382
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,400
character a star level. So you know, been, been doing stuff in that game still, which I've been

383
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,080
enjoying. Let's talk about some other stuff I've been playing. While you all have been playing

384
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:07,440
Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, I actually took a trip back and played a prior game of the year

385
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,320
recipient at a game that swept a bunch of awards two years ago. I finally sat down and spent some

386
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,160
serious time with a game called It Takes Two, which swept a lot of game award type of things

387
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,640
about two years ago. And if you're unfamiliar with the game, it is a meant to be a couch co-op

388
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,960
game, although you can certainly play it on the internet. But I think this game is a lot of fun

389
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,440
in couch co-op and that's how I played it. And I wasn't really sure what to expect. I just kind of

390
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,600
figured, oh, it's a platformer that is, you know, couch co-op. Is it really, you know, is it really

391
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,520
going to be all that? I mean, what all these awards? It must be pretty good. And yeah, I got

392
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,920
to say it's pretty darn good. And I think one thing I really enjoy about the game is that it

393
00:40:51,920 --> 00:41:00,160
tells you just enough to get through puzzles. You know, it really walks that line well of

394
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,200
how do we make this challenging without giving it away? And if you're struggling, the characters

395
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,360
will talk to each other. And it's an interesting setup because basically if you're unfamiliar with

396
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,040
the plot, and I'm just telling you what you learned in the opening cinematic of the game,

397
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,160
basically it's about a couple that is divorcing and the child is upset that they're divorcing. So

398
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,720
she basically casts a spell of some sort to get them to play nice. Oh, you've played this?

399
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:39,200
Um, I haven't, but I've seen people play it. And it's adorable. And the dialogue is brilliant.

400
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,800
Yeah. And that's, that's the other thing is that the dialogue is smart enough.

401
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,600
If you're struggling on a puzzle or a boss, they start talking to each other. And if you listen to

402
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,520
what they're saying, it's a big hint about what to do, basically. So it walks that line really

403
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,480
well. But like we were doing some boss fights. So I played for like four hours with a friend of mine

404
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,520
and we got to like the, for those that have played the game, we got to the wasp queen for those that

405
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,840
know that. And that was, you know, kind of a weird fight to figure out at first, you basically have

406
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,080
to ride a rail around the queen's back and shoot. So one, and this is the other interesting thing,

407
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,240
as you progress throughout the game, your tools change out. And one of you gets what,

408
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,360
like in one setup, one of you has a hammer and the other has a nail gun, and you have to work

409
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,680
together to figure out how do you use these items together to get to where we need to go.

410
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:36,560
And then in this one particular stage, one of you gets a sap gun, which can also make weight. And

411
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:44,640
then one of you gets a flame launch, matchstick launcher that creates fire so you can blow up sap.

412
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,240
So in this boss, you have to like skate around to the back of the boss, sap it up, and then the

413
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,560
other person has to skate around the back and light it on fire. And that's how you damage it.

414
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,600
All the meantime, you can't both be on the rail, because if you are, then the wasps

415
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,240
get in the way. Somebody has to be down on the floor to basically attract the wasp attention.

416
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,960
So it's pretty darn intricate, actually. But when you figure it out, it makes it really rewarding.

417
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,120
And I think the varied system that come up in the game is why this game was so well received

418
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,360
and did so well a lot of the game awards. So anyway, I know I'm talking about a two-year-old

419
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:27,040
game, but I finally had, you know, I don't play couch co-op a lot. I'm a lot of times playing by

420
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,680
myself on the PC or maybe over the internet, something like Dead by Daylight, Final Fantasy,

421
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,520
whatever. It's very rare that I do like a couch co-op. So that was just a neat experience. And

422
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,160
I'm finally glad I did get around to that game. And we already agreed next time we're able to

423
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,880
hang out. This friend of mine lives in the Bay Area, so we can't see each other all the time.

424
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,480
But next time we hang out, we're going to try to finish the game. So that is something that's on

425
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:56,000
my radar. Let's see, E3VL in chat says, Can you play single player? I do not believe you can.

426
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,520
But if you want to check out another game by the same studio, Brothers, or what was the full name

427
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,000
of the game, Brothers, Something Journey, somebody in chat will probably yell it out. That one was

428
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,400
single player. I think it's like one person moves with the control, left control, one person uses

429
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,080
the buttons to move around. So- I think it's two analog sticks. One uses one analog stick,

430
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,240
the other uses the other analog sticks. Oh, I thought it was the buttons. A Tale of Two

431
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,480
Suns. Thank you. That was it. I knew it had a subtitle to it. Bobby Blackwell said this is the

432
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,640
F the Oscars guy, right? Yes, it is. And Tiger Class says they're supposed to adapt it as a

433
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,200
movie. I didn't get that at first. But now that I've played it and really immersed myself in the

434
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,240
story, I really could see this becoming a movie. Like it makes total sense now. I'm like, oh,

435
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,280
yeah, this could be a movie easily. And I think it could be a movie that does very well, actually.

436
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:58,160
So we'll see. We'll see. Other than that, I've been playing, of course, my phone games I usually

437
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,160
play. I hit level 75 in Pikmin Bloom. Haven't been playing as much Pokemon Go, though. I'm just

438
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,760
starting to feel the everybody else is over it. So I might be over it too kind of thing on that

439
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,440
game. But you know, I'm still I'm still a fan of Pikmin Bloom. And I've been walking today was

440
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,440
community day. So I walked my 10,000 steps and got my little badge. But I want to talk about

441
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,360
another Niantic game that came out this week. It's a game called Peridot. Even though you might think

442
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,920
in reading it, it's peridot is usually what you would think of, but they actually have said it's

443
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,640
called peridot because the little creatures that you raise in the game are called dots.

444
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,160
A lot of people who are describing this game are calling it a mix of Pokemon Go. And by the way,

445
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,520
if that's the sentence on your triple A gaming website that's reviewing or doing oppressions

446
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,760
of this game, they have clearly not played the game. It has nothing in common with Pokemon Go,

447
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,280
except the fact that it has the same game maker. And it uses the point of interest system but not

448
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:06,320
nearly in the same way. In fact, actually, for all the Niantic adventuring to the various points

449
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,960
of interest in your town, it's actually not that critical to the game at all. In fact, if you lived

450
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,760
in a rural area, there's very little I think you'd be lacking in this game from not having a lot of

451
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:25,040
Poke stops or whatever around you. That all being said, the game is what it is, is it's a modern day

452
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,320
Tamagotchi. That's exactly what it is. And it is a huge tech demo and I will say an impressive one

453
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:39,040
for AR, which is a big direction that Niantic is trying to go. Basically, you pick up the game and

454
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,840
you have the camera shooting your room or whatever, and you have this little creature that runs around

455
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,480
your room and you can feed it, you teach it tricks, and you can throw like a ball and the

456
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,720
ball will bounce off of things in your room. You trace little circles on the screen and the

457
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:02,320
Peridot will jump through the hole and do a thing called scavenge. And it actually detects, is this

458
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:09,520
like a wall in somebody's house? Or is this grass? Is this sand? And based on what it is you're doing

459
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,240
a scavenge on, you may get a different reward, which is interesting. Also, you may have things

460
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:20,000
like little mini quests in the game to have your Peridot say hello to another animal. So yes,

461
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,840
you point the camera at your cat, which I did, and the dot actually walks up to the cat and will kind

462
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:31,920
of like sniff at it and do those sorts of things. And then you get your little thing or other people

463
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,280
and it does a similar thing with that as well. So honestly, the thing with Peridot is that it's

464
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:47,120
very much like a tech demo in the way that 1-2 Switch is a tech demo game for the Nintendo

465
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:55,520
Switch. So it's a very impressive tech demo type of thing going on here. Here's the problem with

466
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:04,880
Peridot, and it's a big problem. There's no game loop. There's no game loop. Like one could argue,

467
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,280
oh, the game loop is you should be doing the little quests and leveling yourself.

468
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:17,680
Actually, what I thought the game loop was going to be was you want to keep breeding the Peridots.

469
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,880
You want to keep making other Peridots to inherit other characteristics so that you can log in your

470
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,360
journal. And maybe that's the part that people think is Pokemon Go, but I guarantee you people

471
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,800
have not explored this because here's the part that's just going to make you go, what in the

472
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:42,800
actual fuck are they thinking? A nest to breed a new Peridot costs five dollars in the in-game

473
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,760
shot to breed one Peridot. You get one free when you load up the game for the first time.

474
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,360
I'm sorry, nobody is going to fucking pay that. Nobody's going to fucking pay that. And I can't

475
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:05,360
believe Niantic thought somebody actually would. Now, my understanding is in the beta of this game,

476
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:12,080
there were nest fragments that you could find to build a nest, and that was a way to breed Peridots.

477
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,320
However, that is missing in the current state of the game. In fact, it sounds like there's a lot

478
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,240
of things that were in beta that have been removed for the game's release. Now, you can call Niantic

479
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,160
money hungry all you want, and in this particular case, you wouldn't be wrong. But Niantic is simply

480
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,520
doing themselves a disservice with this because there is no game loop. I'm sorry, paying five

481
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,680
dollars every time you want to breed a Peridot, that is not a game loop. I'm not going to

482
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,880
acknowledge that by calling that a game loop. That is off the table. So, as far as I'm concerned,

483
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,600
there is no game loop in this game. Therefore, a Peridot has no lasting value beyond three days.

484
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,880
But I'll tell you, those three days, it's a pretty- it's kind of neat. Like, you'll probably download

485
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,400
this game and go, that's kind of neat. And then when you go, oh, I got to pay five dollars to

486
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,720
breed- okay, I'll delete it. I've seen everything. Boy, did Niantic shoot this fucking game in the

487
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,080
foot. Why even bother developing new games if they're just not going to put effort into them?

488
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,640
Money, I guess? I mean-

489
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,840
It's because, go back to what I said, it's the AR tech demo. And that's where they're really

490
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,240
going is they want that AR stuff to be their bread and butter. And that's, you know, well,

491
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,040
but as far as I'm- they're doing themselves no favors by setting this game up to fail.

492
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,680
Now, could they make some small changes and repair the state of this game? Yes,

493
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,880
but they need to do it fast. The only reason I hold out a little bit of hope

494
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,920
is that Pikmin Bloom was a little bit like when it first launched too, but they've done a lot of

495
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,480
work on it and trying to figure out what's the right thing to charge for what. And even though,

496
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,200
yes, it still has some transparent, oh, they're trying to get me to buy expanded storage,

497
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,360
you can still earn the currency for that expanded storage by walking. You just have to do a lot of

498
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,960
it. Or you can recycle other Pikmin. It's just, you know, you have to learn to let things go.

499
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,240
And, you know, there are other ways to get in the game. So, Peridot is fixable,

500
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,240
but in its current state, it's nothing more than a tech demo that's going to last three days,

501
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,880
and then you're going to be over it. I wonder if Niantic needs to get bought by another company

502
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:32,720
that actually makes games. And I've been one of their biggest supporters and champions here

503
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:39,120
on this platform, on social media, and so forth. And even I'm starting to be like, yikes.

504
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:49,040
I don't know what else to say. Dr. T and Chat says, I'm not sure if I'm 100% on board with

505
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,880
AI yet. I don't know if you meant to talk about AR because that's what I was talking about.

506
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,120
I don't know if you've seen the beer commercial, but some of it seems odd for lack of a better

507
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:04,720
term. No, I haven't seen that. And AR still is something that's in its infancy, but I can see

508
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:13,120
how it's getting there slowly. And I saw how it was getting there slowly. I remember several

509
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:19,120
years ago when Bobby Blackwolf had a developer hololens kit that I got to try, and there was a

510
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,160
really cool little demo that was like a detective game that you played in AR. That was really cool.

511
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,120
I know the answer. Microsoft needs to buy Niantic. That is what I want to happen. I want

512
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:38,160
Microsoft to buy Niantic. If Microsoft can't buy Activision Blizzard, then I want them to buy

513
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:49,760
Niantic. I said it. Anyway, that was my gaming week in a nutshell. So, we're going to move on

514
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,360
to some news, and then we'll, of course, get to your calls a little later in the show as well.

515
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,360
Dejirama S in chat says, Rob Roberts, whatever you're smoking, please put it down. Am I wrong?

516
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,080
Doesn't Niantic need help in making games right now?

517
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:12,080
Because Niantic has a lot of good stuff in the AR space that lends itself very well to gaming. Oh,

518
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:18,560
isn't this what Microsoft was trying to do with the hololens? But then they had to pivot,

519
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:23,680
and now they're not using it for gaming anymore, but they're using it for business, which tends to

520
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,400
be Microsoft's biggest bread and butter anyway. They pivoted it to that, just like they did

521
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:36,320
Kinect. Isn't that a great marriage waiting to happen? I don't know. But Niantic is probably

522
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,360
a really expensive company. I mean, despite all the facts, and they're also not publicly traded,

523
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,040
which is also extremely obvious, by the way. Niantic is not a publicly traded company,

524
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,920
and when you see all the mistakes they keep making when they should be writing so high,

525
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,600
it is so obvious they're not a publicly traded company, because the stockholders would have

526
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:02,560
thrown a fucking fit at several of these things that have come up so far. But anyway.

527
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,800
SG100Matt in chat says, I don't know how I feel about the idea of Niantic being better if they

528
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,560
got bought. I get it. I get the reservations. I really do. And I'm not a fan, usually, of big fish

529
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:21,680
eating bigger fish. However, I feel like Niantic needs a lot of help in making games.

530
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:28,320
Do you want to talk about NBA All World? Did you all forget about NBA All World already?

531
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:33,280
The game that they licensed with the national basketball? Do y'all remember that Niantic has

532
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:43,360
an NBA game right now? Yeah. Yeah. Niantic needs help. Anyway. Let's move on. Let's get into some

533
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:49,600
other headlines and what all is going on in the gaming industry. And then we'll get to your calls

534
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,240
and your emails later in the show. But first, some headlines. Loki, we'll go to you. Yeah,

535
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:03,040
so Valve's updated their Steam's code of conduct. So now it's added gambling as part of the code of

536
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:10,480
content that basically it's outlawing engaging in commercial activity is the actual bullet point.

537
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,960
Examples of such prohibited behavior include posting advertisements, running contests,

538
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:20,400
gambling, buying or selling Steam accounts, selling content, gift cards and other items,

539
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:27,120
and begging. So this is also targeting, you know, the CSGO skins, gambling stuff that I think they

540
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:34,240
even fought in court, as well as, you know, other, you know, unauthorized selling of accounts and

541
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:42,640
whatnot. So it's finally now on, I guess, on paper. So now they can ban people if they're

542
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:50,000
caught doing this, whereas before it was just kind of frowned upon. So it makes sense. They

543
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,360
don't want to run afoul with, you know, the gambling laws and stuff like that in other,

544
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,560
you know, countries. So it makes sense that they would add that as something they would ban people

545
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:08,480
for. Yeah, it's interesting because Steam has had a lot of, you know, on the storefront they've

546
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,480
had a recent kind of redesign. It's almost like they're trying to position themselves for

547
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,640
something. I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into it because certainly just wanting to

548
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,160
stay out of legal hot water is, I guess, good enough. But it does seem like there's been a lot

549
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,720
of activity on the Steam front lately. And maybe that's just as simple as the Steam deck seems to

550
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,640
be doing well, and we're probably going to get more of it. But it's just it's just interesting

551
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,200
timing. That's all with this. Do you think there's anything to read into that? Or it's just it's just

552
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,080
wanting to make sure that

553
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,720
Zachary Reality It's probably just to fix like some discoverability and stuff like that on the

554
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:50,560
storefront. You know, maybe making a little bit more of like a making it work better with like

555
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,160
the Steam deck for something like that, because they probably see the Steam deck as something

556
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,000
that they could sell a lot of. And so making the storefront maybe look better on the Steam

557
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,520
deck would be a possibility. I haven't seen a whole ton of changes. I mean, honestly, like

558
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:11,840
the storefront, it's not all that useful as far as discovering things. But I don't know.

559
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,600
The only thing I discover is all the adult games that they keep making it into that list.

560
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,600
It's like you just have to look at the names and you say, okay, well, that's interesting.

561
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,920
Zachary You know, it's funny. I didn't talk about it during my gaming week. But since

562
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,320
Steam got brought up, I saw a tweet that was talking about a game that came out on Steam,

563
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,520
and it's a free game. And that's honestly about all this game is worth. But it was it gave me

564
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,320
some tee hees. And that game is called Flappy Souls. And it's a mix of Flappy Bird meets Dark

565
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:52,000
Souls. And I played Flappy Bird already hard. I know it's like the physics in this game were

566
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,600
somehow even harder. And like I barely got very far at all. But I was getting souls for whatever

567
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,120
that's worth. So it's it was silly. But yeah, just just goes to show that like they'll put anything

568
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:09,520
on that store any these days won't they? Like here we Flappy Bird clones in 2023? Really? On my

569
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:18,400
internet? It's time to come back. So Mike Defton chat says I wonder if I'm still good at Flappy

570
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,720
Bird? Don't use this game to answer that question because the answer will be no.

571
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,840
All right. Let's talk about maybe a place where they can announce Flappy Souls 2. That is Summer

572
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,200
Game Fest 2023 is coming up. We've been talking a little bit about this, but this game is somewhat

573
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:45,200
on the horizon. It is happening on June 8 at 12 Pacific 3 Eastern 12 noon Pacific. It will be on

574
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:50,640
YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook, all the places you can expect to see a video. They are talking

575
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:56,160
about world premieres, gameplay demonstrations and announcements. And it will be in front of a

576
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,000
live audience. So for the last few years because of COVID lockdowns and so forth, and the world kind

577
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
of finding its balance after that, it's been 100% virtual and all that. But it will be in front of a

578
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
live audience this year just like the game awards were. So that's not a huge surprise. It will be

579
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,200
at the YouTube theater and I believe tickets are on sale now. Over 40 companies have been announced

580
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:29,200
as taking part. The list is too long. I will read you some highlights. Activision, Bandai Namco,

581
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:36,080
Capcom, Devolver Digital, Disney Interactive, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Gearbox, Magic

582
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:46,960
the Gathering, Microsoft or Xbox, Netflix, Niantic, Lord help us, Samsung, Sega, Sony

583
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:54,480
Interactive Entertainment or PlayStation, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Valve, Warner Brothers Games, which

584
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,320
might tie into something we're gonna talk about in a little bit. I didn't even name everybody.

585
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:06,160
Everybody is here except one. There's one company I didn't say who's not on the list,

586
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,120
which is actually a little bit surprising because usually they participate in Geoff Keighley stuff.

587
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:18,560
Nintendo. Nintendo's not there. They'll do their own thing. That's right. Nintendo does their own

588
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:24,640
thing right around this same time. But I'm still a little bit surprised they're not giving one

589
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,600
they're not giving one little nugget to Geoff Keighley, even if it's a like more of an indie

590
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,960
tone type of game or a smaller shadow drop release type of thing. I'm a little surprised at that,

591
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,920
but it is what it is. Well, they may not necessarily announce everybody that's gonna

592
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,640
be there if they really want to be. I don't know. We'll see. Who cares? Yeah, maybe. But I wouldn't

593
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:53,440
get the hopes up on that whole thing. So S.J.O. and Hunter Matt says the Disney and Square Enix

594
01:00:53,440 --> 01:01:00,160
mention got folks excited. Oh, people reading into Kingdom Hearts 4. Maybe. But we also know

595
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:06,880
I would actually say, yeah, Kingdom Hearts 4 isn't off the table. However, don't forget Disney just

596
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:14,480
put out a pretty big Mario Kart clone on mobile phones that they are trying to enhance and make

597
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,880
that Disney speedster or something like that. So I imagine they want to announce something that,

598
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,280
you know, probably new characters, new tracks. I hear that game is very limited in tracks right

599
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,680
now. So probably want to announce like a little more of a roadmap for that game. And I would

600
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:36,480
assume Square Enix, it's time for the update on Final Fantasy 7 rebirth and what's going to

601
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,320
happen there. And if the game is actually coming out for holiday, release day announcement is

602
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:49,520
coming at this for sure. If it is not coming for holiday, we get the trailer that says that

603
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,520
suddenly, magically has a new release day 2024 in the trailer. So I really feel like

604
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,840
Final Fantasy 7 rebirth is what Square Enix is bringing to the table. We'll see.

605
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:11,120
So, all right. We'll find out on June 8th. Let's move on. Dark Sakura was something else out of

606
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:16,800
Nintendo's world. Yeah, and something that nobody should be surprised by because speedrunner is

607
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:26,240
going to speedrun. So as of two days ago, a speedrunner already beat Tears of the Kingdom

608
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:36,560
in 94 minutes. Now, I haven't checked for updates since then, but yeah, one hour 34 minutes and 33

609
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:45,920
seconds for a full speedrun without using an amiibo. And I'm just like, speedrunners,

610
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:52,960
why? Don't ruin it for us. It'll be fun to watch once they start hitting like games done quick and

611
01:02:52,960 --> 01:03:00,400
stuff like that. I can't wait. But he went over some some tricks that were apparently available

612
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,480
in Breath of the Wild that Nintendo was supposedly fixed, but not really. They're still there.

613
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,440
Well, I mean, they're saying that, in fact, I'm just going to read a quote from the person that

614
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,480
did it. From what we can tell, almost none of the glitches that were present in Breath of the Wild

615
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:28,080
seem to have made it into Tears of the Kingdom, but they're still able to perform those glitches.

616
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,480
They just have to activate them in different ways than they did in Breath of the Wild.

617
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:43,040
And he used a lot of the the fusing ability, the Ultra Hand, which I love that it was named after

618
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:56,560
the old Ultra Hand. And of course, they're probably certain that they'll learn more

619
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:03,520
exploits and they'll be new tools. I mean, the one for Breath of the Wild was 23 minutes and 42

620
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,360
seconds. And I'm actually going to take a quick peek and see if this current time has been

621
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,760
exceeded or I should say, defeated.

622
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,600
While you're looking that up, Bobby, who, as you know, follows the games done quick stuff very

623
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:24,720
closely since he participates with that, mentions in chat Breath of the Wild started at 90 minutes

624
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,240
and now it's in half. And actually, it sounds like even more than that with what was just quoted

625
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:37,920
there. But Bobby also asked, how does this ruin it? Did somebody in chat say that? I mean, if I said

626
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:46,480
it, I was just being silly. Yeah. And people are going to play the games they want to play the

627
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,920
games however they want to play as long as they're not like maybe like spoiling the plot by getting

628
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,480
through it fast as long as you're not like copy-posting it out there all over the internet.

629
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:05,520
Yeah. And I didn't mean it was ruining it. It's just, you know, it's not a competition out there

630
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,400
unless you want to make it a competition. It was just saying it for a fact.

631
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:16,160
By the way, speaking of games done quick, I do want to give a quick plug because since we are

632
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:21,680
not out or since we are not here next week and we will be back on the 28th, I do want to point out

633
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:27,600
games done quick starts on May 28th, a little earlier in the day. And of course, Bobby Blackwell

634
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:32,160
from VOG Network is going to be out there doing some announcing. And he talks a little bit more

635
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,560
about the details on his show and on his social about when you can catch him during that.

636
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:41,200
But of course, we'd encourage you to support games done quick and, you know, all the great charity

637
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,240
and all the great speed runners that are going to happen, whether Bobby's in the hosting chair or

638
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:50,640
not. I actually know some other people. A friend of the show goes way back. You remember Asuka

639
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,440
from the tester years and years. I still follow her on Twitter all these years later.

640
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,720
She's there too, hosting and speed running, actually.

641
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,200
Nice.

642
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,640
So, yeah, so there's-

643
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,720
There's a lot of time, by the way.

644
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,200
There's a lot of fun people involved with games done quick. So I would definitely encourage folks

645
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:15,120
to follow that with starting in two weeks since we aren't here next week. So, yeah,

646
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:20,560
let's do one. Matt says, oh, wow, that's a throwback. And Bobby Blackwell says they've

647
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,760
been chatting for a few years and didn't know she was on OLR way back when. I would imagine she

648
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:31,120
doesn't talk about the reality TV stuff a lot. I don't see her ever bring it up on social media.

649
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,680
She was on another reality show, too. I can't remember the name of it, but that was years and

650
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:41,040
years ago at this point. So I'm sure she's forging a new path forward and totally makes sense.

651
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:50,640
Totally makes sense. All right, let's go back to something I hinted at in a previous story. Loki,

652
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,200
what could a new announcement be that's incoming at the Summer Games Fest?

653
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:04,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So NetherRealm is teasing that- well, teasing a new Mortal Kombat. And so they had

654
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:11,280
kind of a picture of a clock that's ticking down or ticking, I guess, down towards 12,

655
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,240
but then goes to one, which makes people think, oh, it's a new Mortal Kombat and it's going to

656
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,640
reboot the franchise. Again.

657
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,960
Again. I was going to say, Mortal Kombat 9 was a reboot, wasn't it?

658
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,120
Well, we're going to do it again. Well, 11 reset the entire timeline, so.

659
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,600
Let's do the time warp again.

660
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,520
So, yeah.

661
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,360
If that song isn't in the trailer, I'm going to be pissed.

662
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,200
Dr. Frank Infertile, DLC character.

663
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,280
Oh, not in that game. I couldn't stand to watch those horrible things happen to Tim Curry's

664
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,520
likeness. I could never watch that. Nothing more than a laser beam, please.

665
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:07,920
So let's see. Mike Defton Chat says, yeah, 9 was a complete reboot, making everything up that it

666
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,640
was a vision. Don't know the lore after that. Well, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, because

667
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:19,120
I can't confess that I follow Mortal Kombat lore super closely, but wasn't the main villain in 11,

668
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,680
aka Jennifer Hale, wasn't she like a time-based villain? Wasn't her thing?

669
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,440
What I just said.

670
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:30,960
Oh, sorry. Yeah. So what, I mean, it would make sense that maybe she

671
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,440
does something that sends everything, you know.

672
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,160
Cronia.

673
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:38,240
Cronia, thank you. She does something that does the time warp again, basically.

674
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:45,360
Well, no, she's defeated and whoever, there was either one or two true endings,

675
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:50,640
and that is either Liu Kang or Shang Tsung win and resets the timeline.

676
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,380
Hmm.

677
01:08:52,720 --> 01:09:00,720
And like, it's, it's all kinds of shenanigans. Like, I mean, spoiler alert, it's already been,

678
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:06,640
the game's been out for a while now, but like, and I honestly think that the Liu Kang ending,

679
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,120
if it was going to be a real one would be the one because they're not going to go with,

680
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:18,240
you know, the shitty everyone dies one. But he went back to the original Kung Lao to start the

681
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:18,720
process.

682
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,320
That also explained, because a lot of people have been asking, if they're doing Mortal Kombat 1,

683
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,240
how are they going to incorporate the new characters? But it kind of seems like in that

684
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:33,840
layup, there's still a way for characters like, I don't know, Cassie Cage and you know,

685
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,240
some of the newer characters, Jackie Briggs and stuff could could be in it.

686
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,880
It's also just as an aside, it's so funny how many of those voices that I'm hearing

687
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,880
in Marvel's Midnight Suns, because Sindel's voice actor is Storm.

688
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,080
Oh, that's funny.

689
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,360
Who's the new DLC character.

690
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,160
Hey, the voice actor world is pretty small sometimes.

691
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:07,920
Yeah, I just recognize voices now. Like, it's like, like Shao Kahn's voice actor is a Ghost

692
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,420
Rider.

693
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,520
Oh, it's funny.

694
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:18,160
And Cassie Cage's voice is Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers. It's just so funny.

695
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,400
But I can hear them now. I'm like, I can't turn it off.

696
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,360
All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about a game. I don't know how I have a Stadia story

697
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:35,520
when Dark Sakura was our resident Stadia fangirl. But it's actually no longer a Stadia story,

698
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,240
because this has to do with a game that is going to be coming out for other consoles finally,

699
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:45,920
because it was a Stadia launch exclusive, a game called I don't I could see this pronounced guilt,

700
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,360
but it looks like Glit was a game that came out. It was a Stadia exclusive. And of course,

701
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,120
because it was exclusive to Stadia, you haven't been able to play it since January.

702
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:02,160
But it will be coming to other platforms PlayStation five and four, and Xbox series and

703
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:08,640
Xbox one, not the switch. But hey, those platforms will see the game release on July

704
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,440
six. It is a third person survival horror game from the creators of Rhyme Tequila Works. And

705
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:21,280
you're sneaking around a sally in a gloomy town and exploring the dark corridors of the school,

706
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,160
while evading monsters and looking for the missing cousin. So it sounds like it was a cute game,

707
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,720
it just maybe wasn't enough. You know, and this was obviously a lot of the, you know,

708
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,400
issues that Stadia had management wise, it wasn't enough to, you know, really turn heads to get

709
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:42,560
people to consider Stadia as their primary source of gaming. So but it's nice that the game will

710
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,960
get a chance to live on. Still had the best version of Cyberpunk.

711
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,360
Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, there. I mean, there were there were good things about Stadia.

712
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:59,040
And then there was Phil Harrison. Anyway, moving on Dark Sakura.

713
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:13,280
Well, in less good news, I mean, it's different news. Deviation games backed by PlayStation,

714
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:23,040
they have laid off around 90 members of their staff, people already posting about it.

715
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:32,080
It's very unfortunate, you know, that these people are having to go through

716
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:41,920
just another symptom of budgetary ineptitude. And I mean that on multiple levels.

717
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:51,440
But yeah, when they were signed on, they were over 100 employees at the time in 2021.

718
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,480
So that sounds to me like it would be the majority of their employees got laid off.

719
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:04,480
Oh, it's really shitty. And I feel bad for all the people having to

720
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,920
go look for work in an economy that doesn't look out for its people.

721
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:17,920
Yeah. Never like to report on that type of stuff. But unfortunately, it is what's happening

722
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:28,000
in the industry right now. So yeah, Mighty Moss is in chat. Hello. I believe this is a long,

723
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,480
longtime listener, first time chatter, who says, talking about the game I was just mentioning,

724
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:37,360
Glit is awesome. Shame it didn't get more attention because on Stadia.

725
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,000
It's Guilt.

726
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,080
It is Guilt. Okay, Guilt.

727
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,880
Not G-L-Y.

728
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,120
Gamers should check it out. Well, you'll get the chance July 6. I wonder if that was some type of

729
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,600
contract expiration with Google, but you would think all of that was out the window anyway.

730
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,000
Maybe it just took time to... Yeah, I guess if they didn't have a lot of notice about

731
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,240
Stadia shutting down or what that would look like, they do have to still go in and change

732
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:05,200
things because you have to change... When you release a game on PlayStation or Xbox,

733
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:10,720
the buttons have to look like the buttons on the controller. And they have to be called what they

734
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,080
are, whether it's the share button, whatever. You have to call things what they are on the

735
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:21,520
various controllers. That's all part of when a game goes gold. That means it's past that

736
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:27,360
certification process where it needs to hit a lot of criteria more than meets the eye sometimes

737
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:33,920
about releasing on those consoles. It's not sadly as easy. A lot of times it's just exporting in

738
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:42,800
Unity to a different console. Mighty Moss follows up saying, I think it was a porting and contractual

739
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,560
hold up with new platforms. Probably a little bit of both coming into play.

740
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,920
As Joe and Hunter Matt follows up on what Jarek Sakro was just talking about, the unfortunate news

741
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,720
about Deviation Games saying, the tech industry is getting hammered with layoffs. Thoughts are with

742
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:02,000
those folks. I would hate to be looking for work right now in the industry. Yeah, it's rough out

743
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,400
there. And then all you hear about are all these companies that think they can solve all their

744
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:18,000
problems with AI, when what AI is, isn't a new concept. We didn't have it on our show tonight,

745
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,120
but Bobby was talking about it a little bit on his show is that Bobby Kotek,

746
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:30,000
sigh, made a comment in a call with employees about Activision. Somebody was asking,

747
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,720
how is AI going to impact Activision? You know that employee was asking from a place of,

748
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:40,240
please don't do what Ubisoft is doing and try to replace quest writing with AI. But the response

749
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:46,160
was, oh, we could see a AI working in a game like Guitar Hero. And like the note charts could be

750
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:54,640
generated by AI. That's happened in games for a long time. And none of them were any good except

751
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,960
maybe Vib ribbon because Vib ribbon was cute and kind of had some other stuff going for it. But

752
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:04,000
like, I mean, the auto generated note stuff is never good in those games. Well, okay,

753
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:11,360
like it was built around random though. And Vib ribbon was like, how many years ago? Like, I mean,

754
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:16,560
I think AI technology has gotten a little bit better since then. Fair. And to be honest,

755
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:23,280
like you could use AI for like a Guitar Hero game to get a starting point. Like I think there's even

756
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:28,000
like different I want to say we like step mania had something where you could, you know, basically

757
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,480
throw something in there and it would generate kind of steps based off of like where it thought

758
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:37,920
beats were and stuff like that. And all that stuff is like, decades old at this point. So yeah,

759
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,160
I could imagine that. Yeah, they would do that. But they're never making another Guitar Hero game.

760
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:49,440
So that's off the table anyways. Yeah. So anyway, but it just, you know, kind of coupling that with

761
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:55,600
the tech layoff and all that stuff is that I swear you have all these idiots in C suites around the

762
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,800
industry who think that AI can replace these and it's just going to make the situation worse

763
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,320
before it gets better, unfortunately, because there's going to come a point where all this

764
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:10,160
shit backfires. All of it is going to backfire. It's just a matter of time. So

765
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,960
I kind of look at it like sort of having the automatic checkout units.

766
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,160
And how often do you have to call the clerk over to fix it?

767
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:25,680
Mm hmm. Kind of the same thing. There's always going to be a need for the human touch, I think.

768
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:34,000
Yeah. The first time AI drops a slur, and it's already happened. Remember the thing about Twitch

769
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,760
and the AI generated thing that was on there? And you can say, oh, they'll block those words. Well,

770
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:45,040
guess what? Society is coming up with new horrible things to call people all the time.

771
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:51,440
So as soon as AI drops something like that in a triple A game or what it's it's over.

772
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,680
Well, and on top of that, I mean, like, obviously, they wouldn't just generate stuff off the fly

773
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:05,360
with I mean, I wouldn't say always wouldn't be obvious. But like, let's put it this way. So at

774
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:11,040
least with the AI stuff now, and like all the companies talking about AI, I rather hear people

775
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,720
talking about AI than blockchain. So, you know, I'll give them that I'll give you that I will

776
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:22,080
give you that. So like, it's fine. Let's talk about AI versus blockchain. Because blockchain

777
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,560
is not going anywhere as far as like what you guys are going to be implementing with games like,

778
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:34,960
say, Oh, yes, let's unnecessarily add blockchain to this piece of DLC. You know, why? Oh, well,

779
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,520
so you can treasure doing games. Oh, that's weird. Because I think you could set that up

780
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:45,040
anyways, you know, if you wanted to, but I don't know, it's just it's silly. I would like to see

781
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,360
what they're gonna do with it. I do think it is a powerful tool. Will it be used poorly in the

782
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,760
beginning? Yeah, I mean, this is like look at any other like gimmick that's come out for consoles

783
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:00,720
and stuff. 3d for the 3ds motion controls. I mean, sure. Like in the beginning when there's games

784
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:04,480
first implementing that they don't know what to do with it. So it's gonna be garbage, but eventually

785
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,240
it'll get better. Until the next thing comes around.

786
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:15,200
All right. Well, let's move on with our next story, which I think is coming from you, Logie.

787
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:27,120
Yeah, so Annapurna, that company is actually parting ways with the studio behind gone home,

788
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:37,680
apparently following a toxic workplace. So the developer Fulbright, they said apparently their

789
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:47,440
co founder Steve Gaynor is made the studio a toxic cesspool according to the article from Kotaku.

790
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:56,240
And apparently, he had stepped away from that position as a writer back in 2021.

791
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:05,680
But I guess having more influence on the company has made it worse. And then of course, saying

792
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:11,760
he's also said that he's used the last two years to reflect and reconsider his working relationship

793
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,160
with the Fulbright team. But says the studio has been long developing and representing open roads

794
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:25,680
moving forward with publisher Annapurna Interactive taking over the front side of marketing.

795
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:32,640
So after a great deal of consideration, it's just no longer a Fulbright's place to represent open

796
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,320
worlds publicly going forward, it'll be credited to the open roads team at launch and will be

797
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:44,960
covered further here as much as I wish the game the best when it does come out. If you've joined

798
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,760
this newsletter and hoping for fresh info on open worlds, you should do yourself a favor and sign up

799
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:57,280
for the Annapurna newsletter on that front. For the record, Annapurna is also having a

800
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,920
pretty massive sale right now on Steam, just throwing that out there.

801
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,240
Oh, really? Hmm. Yeah.

802
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,240
Cool. Good to know. Love sales.

803
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,760
Sales are good. We should be getting like a Steam summer sale here probably in the next

804
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,880
few weeks, I think. Isn't that usually time to the Fourth of July?

805
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:19,680
Yeah, around E3-ish, I think. Sometimes they'll do stuff like around there. Summer games for

806
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,120
that time.

807
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,440
Yeah. Yeah. We'll probably see on the consoles, especially you'll probably see like if a game

808
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,680
gets a sequel announced, the original goes on sale. You see that a lot. So yeah, there's probably

809
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:34,240
some I noticed there haven't been a lot of huge sales on PlayStation lately. Like they have their

810
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:39,360
regular like, it's the May sale, it's the April sale. There's nothing like really big that they've

811
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:43,040
been pushing lately. So I feel like they're they're waiting on something. So we'll see.

812
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,320
All right. Let's move on to this story. This is a little bit about Twitch culture,

813
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,080
but I actually think this is really cool. As somebody who does, you know, obviously we do

814
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:57,680
this show on Twitch. I stream on a personal stream. Dark Soccer does as well. Loki's dabbled

815
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:02,880
in Twitch, but obviously he found a home on YouTube, which is fine as well. More platforms

816
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:08,880
makes more competition. And then you get new features such as what Twitch is doing, which

817
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:16,560
is a new clip editor, which makes it easy to make vertical style clips. So if you go into a clip in

818
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,760
the clip manager in your creator dashboard, you can do an edit and share clip feature that gives

819
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,960
you a tool that will help you to make vertical video clips. Why would you want a vertical video

820
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,480
clip? Because that is the way most people are watching their phones on platforms like TikTok,

821
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:38,720
Instagram stories, whatever, you know, a lot of those video on demand things are vertical. You

822
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,360
can choose to create a video that just shows the one portion of your stream or splits the view that

823
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,440
like putting your camera on top. There were already tools that help people do this for

824
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:54,240
TikToks. I know Alan had used some on his TikTok that, you know, he got some pretty good clips

825
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,640
out of it. He's Alan Alchemy on TikTok. I should give him a plug here. I rarely use TikTok, so I'm

826
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:04,640
not ready to share mine. But you can see that emotion. So it's nice that Twitch is kind of

827
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:10,240
building that in natively. You can also add your channel name to the clip and so forth. You know,

828
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,400
YouTube Shorts also, I didn't even think is another place where they do a lot of verticals.

829
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,280
So you can again, have some love between Twitch and YouTube. And this is again, just a place for

830
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:25,040
me to remind. It's okay, you know, as a Twitch streamer, it's okay if you don't have the money

831
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:30,400
to do subs. And if you don't have the money to do biddies, it's cool. We get it. Like, you know,

832
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,520
everybody's got a tight belt, a tight budget. It is really meaningful when you do hit those buttons

833
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,680
and you are able to do that kind of thing. But a way that you can show just as much love to a

834
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:48,240
streamer honestly, is by using that clip button. If you laugh out loud, use that clip button and

835
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:53,840
take 30 seconds to like crop the beginning and end of what was funny. And I tell you that goes

836
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,920
a long way. And by the way, I noticed some of you actually have done that with a couple of pieces of

837
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:04,640
tonight's show already, such as when, you know, I said the P word earlier in the show. Some of

838
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:10,400
you are using the clip button and that's great. I love that. Dark Sakura, I'm sure you love to

839
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,560
see when clips get made to your stream as well. And this is just another way that you can make

840
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,720
some of that portable. So this is great. I'm glad that Twitch incorporated this.

841
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,720
Oh, I can always use more, but sometimes people clip stuff. I'm like, why?

842
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,080
You know, I think sometimes people accidentally hit the button, especially if they're watching on

843
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,960
mobile because the make a clip button and the like large screen, but are right next to each

844
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,200
other. Cause I've done that. I've accidentally hit the clip button when I didn't mean to do it.

845
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,640
And then I I've even been asked like, what were you trying to make a clip of? And I was like,

846
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:47,840
I wasn't sorry. I'll make clips. I do make clips when I see funny stuff, but sometimes I'm like,

847
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:57,680
I didn't mean to do that. My bad. So anyway. Okay. Before we get to our next segment,

848
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:02,720
actually, I believe we're seeing some late breaking news coming in. Um, this is,

849
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,000
this is, yeah, this is really sad. Uh, we are getting a link. Thank you,

850
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,680
Tigerclaw for the heads up. We've got a link to a tweet from, uh, Tony Grayson at Grayson's Z80,

851
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:20,080
who says just heard about the passing of Brandon O'Brien, the original Crash Bandicoot voice actor.

852
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,320
Uh, it's a huge shock. I've been a fan of Brandon's for years. And recently he and I have

853
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:31,120
been talking about having a role in Anton Blast 2, absolutely gutted and blindsided. Um, R.I.P.

854
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:37,840
1962 to 2023. That was actually made this morning, but just brought to my attention. I was not aware.

855
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,640
So, um, that's a bummer. I'm sorry to end on a bummer, but that's, uh, that's really sad.

856
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:50,960
Like I said, the voice acting world is a small world and, um, yeah. All right. Let's try to

857
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,760
change the tone. Let's pick it up with something that is a fun segment that we like to do here

858
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,960
every week on the show. And I will let the bumper speak for itself.

859
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:15,120
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out

860
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:19,920
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

861
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,560
And what did you pick for us tonight, Dark Soccer, for the classic game?

862
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,800
Picked Fez.

863
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,240
Awesome.

864
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:36,640
Fez came out in 2012. It is an independent puzzle platform game. It was developed by

865
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:46,080
Polytron Corporation and published by Trapdoor. Um, so your character is named Gomez and he wears

866
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:57,360
a fez. Um, his, uh, world appears to be 2d, but it actually rotates around four different

867
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:04,560
two dimensional views to realign these different platforms and solve puzzles. And your goal is to,

868
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:12,800
um, yeah, fezzes are cool. Thanks, Pod Culture. Um, Doctor Who reference. Um, but you have to

869
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:23,040
collect these cubes and fragments to restore order. Um, and it was sort of low profile when

870
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:31,920
it came out, but it really, really, you know, got its own following and the game's been ported

871
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:41,360
elsewhere since then. Um, so, you know, Gomez lives in this happy little 2d world. And then,

872
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:52,080
um, there is, uh, this giant hexahedron thing that basically tears space and time apart and shows the

873
01:27:52,160 --> 01:28:02,080
third dimension. And so, um, the game seems like it's resetting and then you can rotate between

874
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:08,880
the different views. Um, and so you explore quite a bit. You have codes and glyphs and treasure maps

875
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:17,120
and stuff, secret rooms. Um, and you don't really have a lot of guidance to go with. Um, you get QR

876
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:25,280
codes or tetronimos or all kinds of stuff, alts, you know, false clues and everything. Um,

877
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,880
the whole thing is that it uses a very limited palette and it's very pixelated, kind of

878
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:39,280
eight biddish in style and has a lot of nods to Tetris with the, uh, the, um, tetronimos,

879
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:45,280
but it has nods to Legend of Zelda, to Super Mario Brothers, you know, pipe traveling and whatnot.

880
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:52,080
Um, it has all kinds of different settings in there. And then it also has a new game plus

881
01:28:52,080 --> 01:29:01,120
that lets you play first person. Um, and the game went through pretty long developmental, uh, cycle.

882
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:12,240
Um, it, it was, gosh, they said for Phil Fish, the developer, um, it took about five years to

883
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:19,760
make the game. Um, but I mean, once it was, once it was out, it won awards. It was, uh,

884
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:31,440
in PAX 2011, it got the PAX 10 selection. Um, it, Eurogamer basically, you know,

885
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:40,400
was all about the game. Gamasutra gave it positive ratings. It really, it really flew. Um,

886
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:48,880
and then, um, basically when it was released on April 13th, 2012, it sold about 200,000 copies.

887
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:57,760
Um, as long as it was exclusive to the Xbox live arcade platform. Um, and then, but Fish

888
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:04,400
had some problems with Microsoft studios as a co-publisher for not giving it a lot of publicity

889
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:11,520
when the game was released. Um, and so there is a pretty big dispute over how much it was

890
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:19,520
going to cost to patch FES. So after that, there was a Windows port. Um, and then after that,

891
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:27,440
we had an OS 10 and Linux, uh, port. Uh, then we had PS3, PS4, Vita, uh, came out after that.

892
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:38,720
Then it was, oh yeah, and iOS and iOS ports. Um, and that came out in 2017, uh, no Android port,

893
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:50,800
um, had been, been planned or released to my knowledge. Um, but basically the, the game was,

894
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:59,760
uh, actually wrote in a visual, uh, C sharp express and XNA game studio express. Um,

895
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:09,840
and it was done in Trixel, which converts 2d to four-sided 3d voxels, you know, basically

896
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:19,920
like different types of pixels. Um, but the game was designed in Photoshop with the software

897
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:26,480
converting it into 3d assets. Um, you know, most of the levels were designed by just using simple,

898
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:36,640
um, extrusion, um, which to just basically pull up from the flat shapes. Um, it had, you know,

899
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:42,560
all kinds of different stuff tucked in, um, you know, nods, like I said before, to Super Mario

900
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:51,120
Brothers and Legend of Zelda, and even to some of Miyazaki's, uh, open sky feel and, uh, to

901
01:31:51,120 --> 01:32:01,040
Ico as well. Um, the music was done by Disasterpiece, um, also, uh, real name, uh, Rich Vreeland,

902
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:10,560
and it was very chiptune, electronic, um, and it really of course worked well with the game.

903
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:17,840
And then there were of course also tracks that had imitations of bats and thunderstorms and

904
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:24,640
taiko drum and, you know, water dripping off stalactites and all kinds of different stuff. And

905
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:34,960
there were, um, nods to, um, to other games and other movies like, you know, Lord of the Rings and

906
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:45,200
80s horror films and, um, some Legend of Zelda music, some Mass Effect, um, music. So, um, and

907
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:52,880
there's also a synthesized rendition of Chopin's Prelude, Opus 28, number four. Um, the song is

908
01:32:52,880 --> 01:33:02,800
Continuum and, you know, lots of, uh, use of really classic, um, instruments as well, like a

909
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,600
mini-mog. If you don't know what the mini-mog is, it came out in 1970 and it was one of the first

910
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:16,000
home-sized, I would reckon, um, uh, synthesizers put out by Mog, um,

911
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:23,200
if you don't know how it's spelled, look up M-O-O-G, Mog. Um, which is also, by the way,

912
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:29,520
the full Mog is what Wendy Carlos used for Tron and switched on Bach.

913
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,240
Love Tron.

914
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:36,240
Yeah, she's awesome. Um, but at any rate, the soundtrack came out on Bandcamp and

915
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:42,400
basically flew off the virtual, uh, shelves and really good, really good soundtrack. Um,

916
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:50,880
and even, uh, someone was actually mentioning that they heard even references, uh, to, uh,

917
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:57,840
Pink Floyd and Soft Machine and, uh, Kraftwerk in some of the tracks. I thought it was really cool.

918
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:05,360
Love to hear the influences as they show up. Um, but like I said, it was generally favorable.

919
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:14,480
Um, it got for Metacritic on Xbox 360 89 of 100, but, uh, the other releases were between

920
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:23,600
90 and 91 out of 100. Um, most of them gave, gave, uh, eight out of 10 or higher for the rating.

921
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:34,400
Um, and even the New York Times, um, labeled it as a tribute to 1980s gaming as a, and also

922
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,520
said, and I'm going to read the quote here, lovingly almost excessively devoted to the

923
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:45,760
golden age of Nintendo. There were some that were comparing some of the aspects to Cave Story and

924
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:55,280
how well made that was. Um, even some surrealism thrown in there. Um, it's just very, very

925
01:34:55,280 --> 01:35:03,360
interesting. The, the, the ties to other things that people have, um, you know, related this to,

926
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:09,520
I think it's, it's pretty nice. And then of course, Fez itself became, um, an inspiration

927
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:18,560
for a few other games, um, including Monument Valley, uh, Crossy Road, uh, Secrets of Rhyticon

928
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:31,840
and Tunic. Um, there was a announcement for a sequel. Um, it was a one more thing sort of item

929
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:38,960
in the June, 2013 Horizon Indie Game, uh, press conference, um, that was held at E3.

930
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:45,440
And then the project was canceled after Twitter argument between Phil Fish and a journalist named

931
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:54,560
Marcus Beer. Um, so that was it. It was basically canceled because of a snit.

932
01:35:54,640 --> 01:36:07,040
That's your game. All right. The classic, classic game of the week is Fez. A lot of people, uh, in

933
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:12,400
chat commenting because, uh, you know, about Phil Fish and that whole thing, uh, you know, with the

934
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,640
movie and everything, which, you know, I guess maybe this game kind of almost took on a different

935
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:22,640
life in that regard. Um, but yeah, definitely, definitely there's been a lot of coverage on this

936
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:28,880
game in the past. Um, but it just kind of goes to show, you know, um, love it or hate it. Uh,

937
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:34,560
what a modern, uh, you know, contemporary, uh, classic, especially out of the indie scene,

938
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:42,400
it is for sure. Well, even on top of that, as far as, um, it itself being a classic,

939
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:48,480
it draws from classics. And like I said, not just in gaming, but in the music direction,

940
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:56,880
the general art direction of the game. Um, it's, it's a very unique study, especially if you

941
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:03,360
are well versed in music history and, um, and art history. All right. Classic.

942
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:10,960
I'm just saying there was a lot of real intelligence put into this game. Classic

943
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:16,080
game of the week is Fez. I see some other people in chat saying, I should go revisit that game.

944
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,520
So, uh, it's always, always fun when the segment can inspire people to go

945
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,640
revisit something in the backlog. Don't, don't play into death's demands. No, I,

946
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:29,600
I also still really need to play tunic. That's for sure. So, um, my friend who I played,

947
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,120
it takes two with said that's a good game too, but I always, you know, I figured it was a good

948
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:39,760
game. All right. We still have just a few more stories for you and then believe it or not,

949
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,840
we're going to go right into calls. We didn't have quite as many stories slotted for tonight,

950
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,800
just because, uh, it's been a little bit of a lighter week. Honestly, uh, I guess people are

951
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,640
too busy playing Zelda or probably more realistically, uh, with summer game Fest on

952
01:37:54,640 --> 01:38:00,160
the horizon, there just isn't quite as much news coming out, uh, because people are sitting on it

953
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:05,600
for, uh, you know, whether it be the official summer game Fest event or something else timed

954
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:11,280
around that event, uh, with there being no E3 this year, uh, we probably get to be seen a lot

955
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:16,160
more headlines, um, a little closer to that. So it's probably going to be slow for a couple of

956
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:20,400
weeks, but we do have some fast headlines. So let's do some rapid fire news. Loki.

957
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:26,160
Yeah. So we have the announcement from game freak that they're going to be working with

958
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:34,800
take two's private, uh, division label to create a brand new IP that is called a codenamed project

959
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,600
bloom. It is, uh, they have a pretty cool screenshot from this. I'm not really sure what

960
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:45,520
it's supposed to be, but, um, basically it says, uh, to celebrate this announcement private

961
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,960
division and game freak have unveiled the first piece of concept art for the game,

962
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:55,120
which looks like it's like a giant forest and has like some person with either an umbrella or

963
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:59,680
that's a mushroom. I can't really tell. Um, but it's like, it's some sort of action adventure

964
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:06,720
game and it is going to be a new IP. So, uh, we'll have to figure out when that's coming.

965
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:11,520
Not for a while though, because it says the game won't be coming until, uh,

966
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:21,120
2026 fiscal year. So early 2027. Wow. That is very early on. Does this even make the PS5

967
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:28,000
when 2027 be the end of the seven year cycle and the time we start talking about PS6. Yeah. Yeah.

968
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,440
So we'll see. I think whatever that is, it'll be neat. Well, I can tell you what it's not,

969
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:38,560
and that would be Pokemon, but for Sony, um, it seems very clear this is going to be going

970
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,160
a different direction. And because of that reason, it's like, okay, I got nothing to go off of

971
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:46,080
one piece of arts. Not enough for me to know anything about this. Okay. Game freaks making

972
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,840
something for Sony. Cool. Can't wait to see a trailer or something that tells me a little more.

973
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:56,560
And that's, that's, that's all I got on that. Pretty much. It's not much. Um, also we have

974
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:03,760
the announcement that power wash simulator has, um, sold 7 million copies, or I should say have

975
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:08,080
7 million people play it because obviously some of that is going to be game pass and whatnot,

976
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:13,840
but, uh, yeah, very exciting. And I know this year they've, uh, we talked about it weeks ago,

977
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:20,080
but that they've got quite the slate of DLC and stuff coming out for it. So I can't wait to check

978
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,160
that out. I dabble in that every once in a while. I need to go back and visit, especially with some

979
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:28,960
of the recent stuff they've put out. So that's a fun game. Yep. All right. Dark soccer. I think

980
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:37,760
you got one headline for us. I do just a little one. Um, there is a new open beta for street

981
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:46,800
fighter six, um, play test for PS five Xbox series and PC, uh, to go from May 19th to the 21st.

982
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:55,520
It will have, um, eight characters, which will be to me, guile Jamie. That isn't me. Um, Judy,

983
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:03,200
uh, Ken, Kimberly, who's so much fun, Luke and you, and a few different stages like, uh, the

984
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:09,760
carrier Byron Taylor, Gamboo temple, Metro city, downtown, the macho ring channel one,

985
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:16,080
and, uh, the training room. You can customize your avatars and the battle hub. Um, there's

986
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:24,560
cross-play commentary, um, all kinds of stuff. So, uh, definitely something worth checking out

987
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,320
if you can. Yeah. I'll have to check that out. I mean, I played the last beta, but it was,

988
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:32,000
but not enough. I need to play more of it. Speaking of open betas, you know what had

989
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,680
a beta this weekend was Diablo four. I didn't play it. I I'm shocked at myself, but I was busy.

990
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:44,080
I had IRL stuff and I thought for sure I would have until Monday noon when they would pull the

991
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:48,800
plug, but no, they pulled it today. They called it a weekend and then ended it at noon on a Sunday.

992
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:56,320
Silly. So also for Tekken eight, they released the Hwa Rong, uh, trailer. Oh, really? Uh,

993
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:03,680
he used to be like my guy. All right. Well, let's go over to Sony and talk a little bit about

994
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:08,640
PlayStation plus, uh, specifically what is coming to the game catalog. If you're an extra or a

995
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:14,880
premium subscriber, uh, as well as what is getting added to the classics catalog. Uh, so some new

996
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,120
games are showing up in the game catalog. There's probably a few too many for me to read, but I'll

997
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:24,080
just mention some of the highlights. We have Conan exiles, uh, dishonored death of the outsider and

998
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:29,520
dishonored to the evil within two humanity, which is a new release. So that's going to be there as

999
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:34,880
well. Uh, ratchet and clank rift apart. Also a newer one from the PlayStation five rise of the

1000
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:42,000
Tomb Raider 20 year celebration, uh, is coming as well. Sakuna of rice of ruin. Um, let's see,

1001
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,120
we have, uh, some of the Tomb Raider games, the more recent ones are coming as well. Watchdogs

1002
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:54,240
Legion in the classics catalog for the PSP. We have blade dancer, lineage of light pursuit force

1003
01:42:54,240 --> 01:43:00,560
siphon filter, Logan shadow, and PlayStation four Ghostbusters, the video game remastered.

1004
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,440
So, um, I was hoping we'd see more like pick up the pace y'all on those classics. I don't know

1005
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:11,520
what's taken a while for some of them to get. I mean, I guess because they put trophies in them

1006
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:16,000
and they try to really make them full featured releases, but, uh, really would be hoping to see

1007
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,760
more, uh, come into that, but it is, you know, they're trying to beef up what's in that collection

1008
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,160
to begin with. So can't complain about that. All right. Let's travel around the world and check

1009
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:30,640
out some new games coming out this week, uh, on the various platforms in the various countries.

1010
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:39,280
So let's start with the U S Loki. Not a lot. Um, so we've got, let's see humanity on PC PlayStation

1011
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:46,080
four and PlayStation five. That's that new enhanced game, uh, Trinity trigger on PC,

1012
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:53,520
Nintendo switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five war Lander on PlayStation five and Xbox series.

1013
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:59,280
And last but not least Lego two K drive on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four,

1014
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:04,800
PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. All right. Uh, heading over to Japan. It's

1015
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,880
been a slow couple of weeks. We had golden week happened a little bit ago and it's been kind of

1016
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:13,520
slow on the game releases ever since this week. Isn't too much different, but we do have a few,

1017
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:18,960
we have a few games this time. So on the Nintendo switch, we have Wanda fortune R is coming out in

1018
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,120
a regular and special edition from idea factory. And that's really the only big release on the

1019
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:28,560
switch this week. However, over on the PlayStation five, we have a couple of titles dread out to it

1020
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:34,080
comes out this week, as well as transport fever to, uh, both on the PlayStation five this week,

1021
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:40,400
uh, Lego two K drive also we'll get a Japanese release the same day, the U S gets one. And those

1022
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:46,880
are your releases in Japan this week, dark Sakura. How about Europe on the 16th for PlayStation and

1023
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:54,160
switch. We have Trinity trigger. Um, also on the 16th bus simulator, 21 next stop gold edition.

1024
01:44:54,720 --> 01:45:00,880
Um, that's for PlayStation and Xbox. Um, the rest of these are on the 19th for PlayStation shadow

1025
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:08,960
warrior three definitive edition. Um, on switch toy soldiers, um, on PlayStation and switch, we

1026
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:15,200
have a garden simulator. That's got a gnome. And then on the three, we have Lego two cage

1027
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:25,920
wrap. That's it. All right. Uh, that is it for the stories and segments we had slotted outside of

1028
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:31,040
the classic listener round table. Uh, if you would like to give us a call, of course you sure can.

1029
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:35,680
You can join over at vog at network.com slash discord. You can join our green room. We'll take

1030
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:39,840
a couple of calls tonight, but I actually think we have a couple of emails. Uh, you can email us

1031
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,400
every week, participate at orange laundry.com. If you would like to send us some emails and dark

1032
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:50,080
soccer is going to jump in the mail bag and hopefully, um, not find herself drowning in here.

1033
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:58,720
All right. I'll start with the first one from, uh, Mishi. Um, hi all it's your girl Mishi here

1034
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:03,760
back with another gaming week. This week's games consisted of Nintendo switch games, mostly two

1035
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:08,560
games in particular. I just had a slow gaming week as I've been under the weather. Any,

1036
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:14,960
anyway, said games are as follows. No place like home in this game, you play a girl whose father

1037
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,840
went to space to do a mission. The game doesn't really say just as he's not home right now.

1038
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:26,000
So she sees on earth to take care of his farm. Since the world got taken over by garbage,

1039
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,680
his farm got wrecked. So she stayed behind to rebuild it and clean up the mess.

1040
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,360
You have to farm while creating buildings for the farm out of the trash you find

1041
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:39,200
sort of like recycling. If you will, you also get to befriend animals and cook. It's really a fun,

1042
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:44,880
cozy type of game. The next game I'm sure you're all too familiar with Legend of Zelda. Here's the

1043
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:50,160
kingdom. I got to say Nintendo stepped up their game with this one. I can't really say why because

1044
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,960
I don't want to spoil it for anyone wanting to play, but I will say I'm finding it harder than

1045
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:00,160
Breath of the Wild, yet still a lot more fun. I say everyone should check out these games.

1046
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:06,640
Everyone should check these games out at least once. Have a great day and stay safe, everyone.

1047
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:11,600
Peace, love, and game on. Sincerely, Mishi. Thanks, Mishi, and I hope you feel better.

1048
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:18,560
Yeah. All right. Next email. It says quick question, but knowing who sent it,

1049
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,000
I'm going to refrain. I think it actually is pretty quick,

1050
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:27,200
especially comparatively. Good job. Good job.

1051
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:35,600
Hello, L.R. Hi, Y.Y.R. Just a quick question this time, actually. I've only been playing

1052
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:40,640
Pokemon Go since November, so I was seeking an answer to this question from the folks either

1053
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:45,120
hosting or listening to this show who have been playing for far longer than I have.

1054
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:51,360
At the present, Niantic is running an in-game event where all candy for catching Pokemon

1055
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:55,600
has been doubled for an entire week. This stacks with pineapple berries as well.

1056
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:03,120
I've seen them double catch candy before, but only for one or two featured hours,

1057
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:08,080
certainly not for the whole week. So my question is, have they actually done this before?

1058
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:15,040
Do they do this with any sort of regularity or is this some sort of sign of desperation or perhaps

1059
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,360
just another non-answer to recent community concerns?

1060
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,160
Thanks as always for this show and have a great week, Aaron Y.Y.R.

1061
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,120
Yeah, not the answer I think you were digging for, but it has been seen in game before and I

1062
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:34,320
can tell you the time that you can regularly expect it is Halloween because, get it, candy.

1063
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,800
Mike says it's a regular thing.

1064
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:42,720
Yeah. Our Pokemon Go experts in chat kind of agree with what I'm saying is that you can pretty

1065
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:50,720
reliably see this in game for multiple days. You also pointed out that they do it hours at a time,

1066
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:56,400
fairly regularly too, like community days. You want to read what's going on because

1067
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:01,840
usually they either boost candy, they boost Stardust, they boost XP, usually something

1068
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:07,760
like that gets boosted. And then same thing with spotlight hour. You can almost reliably

1069
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:12,640
count on once a month, there will be at least one hour you can get double candy.

1070
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:15,600
And I know that sounds like a lot to kind of hold out for, but

1071
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:23,120
never recycle a legendary unless it's dire inventory space or something.

1072
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:28,160
Never recycle a legendary outside of one of these double candy drops. But if you're, you know,

1073
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:32,880
if you're bursting at the seams, not that people have as many legendaries anymore anyway,

1074
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:40,640
because most people stopped rating. But if you can never shred the legendaries until one of

1075
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:46,560
these spotlight hours at least, but you can, you can expect it around Halloween. I think Easter

1076
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:52,720
had it this last year too. So, you know, just, just think of things where it's cute to work in

1077
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:59,360
candy as a bonus. And usually you're going to see it there. SJ100Matt says, if they're going to do

1078
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:04,880
a community day for a Pokemon that needs a lot of candy to evolve, they'll do double catch candy as

1079
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:12,480
well. I think Noibat had that because that was a 400 candy Pokemon to evolve. So keep an eye out

1080
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:18,240
for that. And sorry, I'm terrible at gifts. YYR, I promise you every time I open the game, I do try

1081
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:23,520
to go into it. I haven't been playing as much lately. I've just been feeling a little meh on

1082
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,920
Pokemon Go. It kind of comes and goes. But I'm sure at some point there'll be something where

1083
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,080
I'm like, oh, I want to go catch a new thing. I'll go Bluetooth, catch a new Pokemon, a new shiny,

1084
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:37,040
I don't know. Maybe I'll play. Actually, I can't do the community day next week because I'm going

1085
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:42,160
to be on a work trip. And I think I'll be in a conference when most, the conference is on a

1086
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:48,080
Sunday, but I'll be in the conference during most of it. So yeah. So apologies if we're Pokemon Go

1087
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:53,280
friends for everybody. I'm terrible at gifts. Conference or Yawn friends?

1088
01:50:55,280 --> 01:51:02,720
Oh, no. I like my job and the stuff I'm going to sounds interesting. I just, my only bitch is

1089
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:08,080
a Sunday. Really? Was it half price? It is weird. Fucking weird.

1090
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:13,440
Yeah, but whatever. It is what it is. I don't get it. Why did they do that?

1091
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:17,040
I don't know. Because the convention center costs less than it does on Friday and Saturday,

1092
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:20,880
I'm sure. But I, why not do like a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? I don't know.

1093
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:23,520
I don't know. All right. The reason.

1094
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,040
Yeah. All right.

1095
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:28,640
Was that it for emails?

1096
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:30,400
Yeah.

1097
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:35,040
All right. Well, if you want to send us an email, participate at orangelandtrader.com.

1098
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:39,440
Don't let us go too many weeks without an email or I'm going to lecture everyone again. I was

1099
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:44,560
kidding. And I was saying this in chat, but I'll say it here too. I kind of feel like the Twitter

1100
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:50,160
question worked out pretty well tonight. As much as I have a love hate relationship with Twitter,

1101
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,120
for the sake of content and interacting with listeners, I'll try to do that a little more

1102
01:51:55,120 --> 01:52:02,080
often, at least until Blue Sky is open invite for all. And assuming that website keeps its legs and

1103
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,840
doesn't become another- Are you on there yet?

1104
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,360
I am. We follow each other.

1105
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:10,320
We do? Okay. Because all these weird people follow me and I'm like, I have no idea who

1106
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:10,880
these people are.

1107
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,320
There are people, because it's a new social platform, there's people that will follow

1108
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:21,280
literally everybody to try to become like the next big, like one of those people that just

1109
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,280
leverages their social media clout for money.

1110
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:25,840
Reasons.

1111
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,480
You know, ads and stuff.

1112
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,080
Well, it's not like I'm following them back.

1113
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:33,360
No, I don't follow them back. If you have more than 10,000 followers already on a closed platform,

1114
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:39,520
or excuse me, if you're following more than 10,000 people on a closed platform like Blue Sky so far,

1115
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,120
I'm not following you back.

1116
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:47,360
If you have 100, less than that, which most people do, then yes, and you say something in

1117
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:52,960
your profile that's like, I'm a gamer. I'm LGBT. Yes, I'll probably follow you back because it

1118
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,400
seems like we might have something in common.

1119
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:02,480
Found a Tia Marie, and I thought it was our Tia because I've never seen anyone else post

1120
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,280
their name like that.

1121
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,040
Oh, you got me excited for a minute.

1122
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,200
And it's not Tia, but they're really cool.

1123
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:08,720
Okay, well, that's good.

1124
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:14,480
Yeah, if you are on Blue Sky, I'm there at Rob Roberts, and Dark Sakura is there too.

1125
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,840
You're just Dark Sakura on there, right?

1126
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:16,880
Yeah.

1127
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,120
Yeah.

1128
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:23,840
My profile shows as DarkSakura underscore OLR to match back to my thing, but yeah,

1129
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,680
it's just DarkSakura with whatever the extension is.

1130
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,320
Yeah, fair.

1131
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,960
Yeah, on the default Blue Sky server.

1132
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,440
I will say if you're waiting to get in there, here's the thing.

1133
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,160
They give us one invite every two weeks.

1134
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:40,960
One invite every two weeks.

1135
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,760
So once you've been on the platform for two weeks, Jamie, they'll send you an invite.

1136
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:48,320
I finally got my first one, and I'm sorry if I didn't send it to you, but I sent it

1137
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:52,800
to the person who asked me for it first, who said that they would use it.

1138
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:56,400
I got mine from another streamer friend.

1139
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,720
I got mine from the same person.

1140
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:04,640
I don't know how they got bulk invites, but yes, that person invited both you and I.

1141
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,560
So I love it.

1142
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:11,200
Yeah, I think I thought he said he sent it to you too.

1143
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,600
So did it make you squee?

1144
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:17,120
I was like, what's this Blue Sky thing?

1145
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:17,360
Okay.

1146
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,880
I was like, what is this thing and why do I want to join?

1147
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,680
Okay, I joined.

1148
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:27,440
Well, and the awesome thing, though, about being on an M1 Mac is that I can run the iOS

1149
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,880
app on my Mac, and it's pretty cool.

1150
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,960
And Mike Def says, I'll get it when I get it, I guess.

1151
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:39,360
And here's the thing, don't let the exclusiveness of it make you feel like you're totally missing

1152
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:39,860
out.

1153
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,360
There are still a lot of parts that's rough around the edges.

1154
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:47,360
Trust me, it's a good thing the floodgates aren't open yet, because there's a lot of

1155
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:50,560
things as a newer network, it's got to figure out.

1156
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,400
And there's a lot, especially when it comes to how are they going to do policy police

1157
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:59,120
some things, some concerns came to light with the terms of service, because it's very boiler

1158
01:54:59,120 --> 01:54:59,680
plate.

1159
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:06,560
But the CEO, who is not Jack, by the way, Jack did start it and I believe is on the

1160
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,800
board because he actually started it when he was at Twitter to do something more decentralized,

1161
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,000
but he is not the CEO.

1162
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:16,080
She's Jay, I think her name is.

1163
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,640
And I think it is Jay.

1164
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:23,600
And she's talked about very openly some of the things that's like, yes, we know this

1165
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:24,000
is bad.

1166
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,200
We're working on it.

1167
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,960
Please give us a little time.

1168
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,240
And that's why they're not opening up the floodgates to the platform yet as much as

1169
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,840
people are ready for it.

1170
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,760
So I get it.

1171
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,160
So all right.

1172
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:41,200
But, you know, an invite, if I have an invite, I'll pass it to you.

1173
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:41,520
Yeah.

1174
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:47,920
An invite every two weeks sounds slow, but like, give it three months and then like,

1175
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:53,040
because in two weeks I'll have an invite and the person I invited will have an invite.

1176
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:57,200
And then in two more weeks, I'll have another, they'll have another, the people we invited.

1177
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,120
So it'll get around soon enough.

1178
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:02,880
Just, you know, you just have to be patient, but give that time to Blue Sky to work out

1179
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:03,760
the kinks.

1180
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:09,600
There's some very basic things, too, that, like, you can't turn off whatever retweets

1181
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,280
or I refuse it to call it the thing that they're trying to force us to call it, reblogs or

1182
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:13,600
whatever.

1183
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,080
You can't turn those reblogs off on that platform.

1184
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:24,000
So that I really need in order to be able to follow certain people, because some people

1185
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:28,640
do it too much and I never see original content and I see it too much.

1186
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:33,040
And I also really need them, too.

1187
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:38,160
When you refresh your feed, it needs to start from where you left off, not at the top.

1188
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,840
That is the most annoying thing to me.

1189
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:42,400
But they'll get there.

1190
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:42,880
They're new.

1191
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:43,440
They'll get there.

1192
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:44,240
They're in beta.

1193
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:45,200
It's not a complaint.

1194
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:46,640
It's just a loud suggestion.

1195
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,120
That's all.

1196
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:48,240
Okay.

1197
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:50,160
It looks like I don't have an extra yet.

1198
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,280
Not yet.

1199
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,840
But you only came in a couple days behind me, right?

1200
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:56,480
You should have one real soon.

1201
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:58,800
Yeah.

1202
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:59,600
All right.

1203
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:04,320
Anyway, that's it, because it was a shorter week and we don't have any calls in the green

1204
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:04,960
room.

1205
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,960
We're ready to wrap it all up for the night.

1206
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,240
So we're going to go around and get some final thoughts.

1207
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:15,840
DarkSakura, I know you are off to do some Dessert by Deadlight streaming.

1208
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,160
Do you have any final thoughts?

1209
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:21,840
Oh, wait.

1210
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:22,720
I need to give the usual.

1211
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:22,960
Sorry.

1212
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,320
I forgot the boilerplate.

1213
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:27,120
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two

1214
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:27,760
about the show.

1215
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,880
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

1216
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,960
want more voices here to put out on air.

1217
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:38,320
Please tell a friend and also a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify,

1218
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:41,200
or wherever you found this show goes an awful long way.

1219
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:44,480
That all being said, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

1220
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,960
I want someone to buy stickers so I can hit my goal for this month.

1221
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:52,480
Please.

1222
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:53,120
Sticker.

1223
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:54,160
I have stickers.

1224
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:59,680
And also, I might try to get another adapt.

1225
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,240
Who knows?

1226
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:02,880
And pray for me because tomorrow I start ballet for real.

1227
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:04,640
Oh, fun.

1228
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:04,960
Good luck.

1229
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,680
Let's sacrifice the chicken and light some candles or something.

1230
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:10,160
And then we'll have some chicken salad by candlelight.

1231
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:12,160
I will have a chicken salad for dinner just for you.

1232
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,480
All right.

1233
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:15,280
Later, taters.

1234
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:15,840
All right.

1235
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:16,640
Bye, DarkSakura.

1236
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,640
All right, Loki, we're going to go to you.

1237
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,840
Your final thought for us tonight?

1238
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:26,960
My final thought is that, well, one, I was going to show off this cool shirt that I have.

1239
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:30,160
I don't know if you can see it, but it's for Master Boot Record.

1240
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:32,480
So it's all like ASCII art.

1241
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:33,440
Oh, OK.

1242
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1243
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:37,760
Because, you know, Master Boot Record, they make music with floppy drives.

1244
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:38,560
So that's awesome.

1245
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:44,000
And then let's see what else.

1246
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:47,280
Unrelated, my neighbor's cat.

1247
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,120
I finally saw her after six months.

1248
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:50,720
She came back.

1249
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:53,760
I thought she was dead because I haven't seen her in so long.

1250
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,360
So she came back for pets.

1251
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:55,760
Let's go.

1252
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,560
She always knocks on the door, which is funny.

1253
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,560
The neighbor's cat knocks on the door?

1254
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,080
Well, she doesn't knock on the door.

1255
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:04,000
She meows at the door usually.

1256
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,600
She'll meow at the door with the door open when the weather's nice.

1257
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:10,000
And she'll want me to come outside to give her pets.

1258
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,680
And she'll actually lay in my lap and let me give her pets and stuff like that.

1259
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:14,400
Which is funny.

1260
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,160
So there's all that.

1261
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,480
So those are the random updates that you get.

1262
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:19,840
Those are my final thoughts.

1263
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:20,240
All right.

1264
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:26,880
My final thought is we will be streaming some Stranger of Paradise tomorrow and some

1265
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,640
theater them on Wednesday.

1266
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:30,560
And then I'm going to be gone over the weekend.

1267
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,680
I'm going to be gone for a bit because this conference is long.

1268
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:36,560
So I'm going to be gone Saturday through Thursday.

1269
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,200
So sadly, my streams next week kind of suffer a little bit.

1270
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,640
But that's you know, it is what it is.

1271
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:43,760
I look forward to the stuff for my day job.

1272
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:44,800
It'll be a good conference.

1273
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:51,280
But yeah, so we will see you in two weeks here at Orange Launch Radio.

1274
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:54,160
There will be no show next week, but I hope you all have a great week.

1275
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:59,680
We will be back, which I believe is Memorial Day weekend and the start of Summer Games

1276
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:00,160
Done Quick.

1277
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:04,160
So it's going to be a busy week in two weeks and probably a bit of news as we start.

1278
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:09,200
Because two weeks after that, Summer Game Fest has happened and the Microsoft event

1279
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:09,840
will be happening.

1280
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:14,320
We're four weeks away from a firehose of news in the gaming industry.

1281
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,840
It's going to be an exciting year.

1282
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,920
Diablo IV is going to be out soon.

1283
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,240
Final Fantasy XVI, not long after that.

1284
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:21,600
Street Fighter VI.

1285
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:23,760
And y'all are eating up Zelda right now.

1286
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:29,840
It is a good year to be a gamer and we will continue this year of the gamer in two weeks

1287
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,120
here at Orange Launch Radio.

1288
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,720
I hope you all have a wonderful week.

1289
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:34,160
We'll see you next time.

1290
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:34,880
Good night.

1291
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:13,520
See you next week.
