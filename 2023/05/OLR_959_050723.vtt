WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.800
Another $70 flagship launch, another critical whiff in terms of bugs, polish and consistency.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.960
Will Redfall become a No Man's Sky or a Cyberpunk 2077? Ask me again in 5 years. Every flagship

00:19.960 --> 00:23.780
title must be a critical hit in order to preserve money, yet cult classic Final Fantasies have

00:23.780 --> 00:27.760
now been allowed in numerous remasters. Which one is more valuable?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.800
This is your knot. Everything is up for an update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob

00:30.800 --> 00:33.680
Roberts, Jamie Sommerson, Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the

00:33.680 --> 00:36.920
week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.920 --> 00:45.520
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:45.520 --> 00:52.720
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode

00:52.720 --> 01:01.040
number 959 of our show for tonight, May the 7th of 2023. I can't believe it. It is May

01:01.040 --> 01:06.760
already. Hi, I'm Rob Roberts here with you every week on Sunday nights with my co-hosts

01:06.760 --> 01:10.840
over there in that little box. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:10.840 --> 01:11.840
Hi.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.120
Hi, how are you?

01:14.120 --> 01:16.120
Not high enough.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.120
Hashtag mood.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.120
Huh?

01:19.520 --> 01:20.520
I said hashtag mood.

01:20.520 --> 01:38.200
I'm a little on the tired and today was another ballet day for me. I did about almost two

01:38.200 --> 01:48.680
hours of just, oh, let me fix my camera, of just stretching and the actual ballet and

01:48.680 --> 01:58.360
then the recovery stretching and then the massage gun and all of the foam rollers and

01:58.360 --> 02:05.120
everything and the feet soaking in ice buckets and all of that. And I have mad respect for

02:05.120 --> 02:13.560
the pros. I only did this for more like an hour and 45 minutes, but the ones that go

02:13.560 --> 02:16.680
and do this as their job. Oh, hell.

02:16.680 --> 02:24.200
Still, it sounds like it's been a super healthy and fun little, I guess, hobby for you. Lifestyle

02:24.200 --> 02:25.200
edition, maybe.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.040
I have something interesting about it is that, well, I had a doctor's appointment on Friday

02:30.040 --> 02:34.720
to have my back looked at because I had been having some pretty bad back pain before. And

02:34.720 --> 02:43.400
a lot of it has fixed itself with having done ballet. I still have the pains, but that's

02:43.400 --> 02:48.640
from activity now and I'm still getting that cortisone shot in my hip. But I've noticed

02:48.640 --> 02:55.680
that since practicing my turnout, where the feet, that it all comes from the hips, I have

02:55.680 --> 03:03.440
better hip rotation. My back has been better. I watch my posture more often. My flexibility

03:03.440 --> 03:08.760
is getting better. I mean, I'm not anywhere near where I want to be or where I used to

03:08.760 --> 03:15.280
be, but I'm getting there. And it's just something about getting up and doing something and challenging

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
myself.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.960
Well, it reminds me of the days when this show started, when you, me, and hi in the

03:19.960 --> 03:25.920
other box, Techmaster Loki, hello, hello. When all three of us got together playing

03:25.920 --> 03:32.200
a Dance Dance Revolution. I was never skinnier. Even today, after I've lost all that weight

03:32.200 --> 03:39.200
since 2022, I'm still not as skinny as I was back when we played DDR several times

03:39.200 --> 03:44.040
a week. And I mean several, like three or four times a week playing hours of DDR. I

03:44.040 --> 03:47.400
was never skinnier than that phase.

03:47.400 --> 03:57.400
Right now I'm doing two hours of ballet every week for now. But I'm actually, I want to

03:57.400 --> 04:02.800
bring out the Dreamcast and play a second mix. My dance pads are so slippery because

04:02.800 --> 04:06.320
the two layers of plastic, because I have official Konami pads and they're dated at

04:06.320 --> 04:11.480
this point, which doesn't help. Yeah. And it's funny. I was watching a video too about

04:11.480 --> 04:16.680
like all of the various codes for all of the DDR machines and it was kind of, I put it

04:16.680 --> 04:19.160
up on my Twitter. I was like, anyone remember this?

04:19.160 --> 04:23.480
Well for actually just real quick, let me, let me pivot on that note over to Techmaster

04:23.480 --> 04:28.080
Loki, because Loki, you were tweeting about DDR machine stuff this week. Did you, you

04:28.080 --> 04:30.360
got back on the extreme in your garage this week, right?

04:30.360 --> 04:35.320
Yeah, I did. Cause I had to hook it back up again. So it still works.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.280
That's well, that's good. It still works.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.840
Yeah. It's go fake, you know, like arcade hardware from the nineties versus computer

04:41.840 --> 04:50.760
from the 2010s, 2020. I think it was like nine, not long ago, like late 2010s, you know,

04:50.760 --> 04:56.680
arcade hardware still fine. Computer's like, no, I can't take, I can't take the weather.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.080
So well,

04:59.080 --> 05:03.640
I'm glad everything still works. How was playing after so long?

05:03.640 --> 05:10.000
I mean, it's, you know, you have to keep just dialing back to, you know, as easy as you

05:10.000 --> 05:14.880
can because it's like your mind, you're like, Oh yeah, I could do that. And then your body's

05:14.880 --> 05:21.360
like, no, you can't. So, I mean, it's obviously, you know, I used to play like pretty high

05:21.360 --> 05:25.880
end, like doubles and stuff. So now it's just, I mean, this is what it was like too. I remember

05:25.880 --> 05:31.200
like coming back into it, like from a long time when I first got the machine, it was,

05:31.200 --> 05:38.620
you know, starting off singles and doing, you know, I think it was like five to six

05:38.620 --> 05:46.460
footer songs. I think now I'm doing, yeah, like four to six. And it's, I was doing the non-stop

05:46.460 --> 05:50.620
site. I tend to do a pop four all the time. Cause it's kind of like middle of the road,

05:50.620 --> 05:56.860
like pretty easy stuff just to get your stamina back up. And because it is a lot when you're,

05:56.860 --> 06:02.060
you haven't done it a while. It's not, I mean, for one, yeah, it's stamina, like very tired

06:02.060 --> 06:08.220
too. Your muscles will like hurt a lot, obviously from not doing it for a while. So it's just

06:09.580 --> 06:14.940
getting used to it again. So it just has to, I have to keep doing it regularly and they'll,

06:14.940 --> 06:19.980
he'll come back somewhat. Yeah, that's definitely the regularity is definitely the key.

06:21.340 --> 06:26.620
I also want to say hello to our folks in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at

06:26.620 --> 06:30.140
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,

06:30.140 --> 06:35.980
even though he wasn't here tonight, he was on a personal trip. But we do tape live on Sunday

06:35.980 --> 06:41.500
nights at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash V O G network. Bobby will be back next week.

06:41.500 --> 06:46.220
He starts an hour before we do, and we will be here next week. We will not be here live in

06:46.220 --> 06:51.180
two weeks. It's not a holiday or anything. It's just a very random day job conflict for me.

06:51.180 --> 06:55.740
So ironically, I believe Bobby had a day job conflict thing today. That's why he wasn't

06:55.740 --> 06:58.620
live and I have one in two weeks. It just, that's the way it goes sometimes.

06:59.340 --> 07:05.660
Also, I may not be here next week because of a Golden State Pinball festival.

07:05.660 --> 07:06.060
Oh.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.980
So this is the only day I can attend.

07:07.980 --> 07:13.020
Oh, dang. I kind of want to check that out to be honest. Where's, is that in Lodi?

07:14.620 --> 07:18.780
Because they had a big Comic-Con there today. I went to the same place. Yeah, they did.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.540
It's Lodi. I don't pay attention much.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.740
Yeah. One of the voice actors.

07:21.740 --> 07:22.700
Sorry Lodi people.

07:22.700 --> 07:26.460
No, one of the voice actors I met at Dragon Con was supposed to be a guest there.

07:27.020 --> 07:32.620
And I noticed on Twitter had to cancel out just, he had, he had an unfortunate situation in his

07:32.620 --> 07:37.260
family. So yeah, he had to back out, but I saw, I was like, Oh, Lodi. I was like, Oh,

07:37.260 --> 07:41.420
which for those that don't know, which I assume would be most people outside this general area,

07:41.420 --> 07:47.180
it's like, it's a suburb of SAC, but kind of, it's like 45 minutes South maybe. That might be

07:47.180 --> 07:50.220
actually be a little, it depends what part of town you're coming from. Yeah.

07:50.300 --> 07:56.220
It's like maybe a 25 to 30 minute drive for me from where I am.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.340
Yeah. Yeah.

07:57.900 --> 08:03.500
So it's not bad. And the venue is actually, you know, pretty good for what it is.

08:05.660 --> 08:11.340
But I mean, last year they had Weird Al, which I would assume they're going to have it again

08:11.340 --> 08:14.620
this year. Our Weird Al should be arriving before too long.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.180
That's awesome.

08:16.140 --> 08:22.620
But, but yeah. But there's a few other tables that I'm really interested in looking at and

08:22.620 --> 08:27.180
I couldn't, I mean, there's a chance I might be able to do some on Saturday.

08:28.380 --> 08:35.500
And if you want to go together, Rob, we can, I can try to get the half day and see if we can go.

08:36.220 --> 08:40.220
I actually have tentative plans on Saturday. So ironically, Sunday would be the only day I could

08:40.220 --> 08:45.580
go to. So we'll have to see. I would just have to leave early. So we'll see. We'll see.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.940
All right. But anyhow, let's get into the show tonight. Actually, one other quick note,

08:50.940 --> 08:55.580
I do want to point out from chat because I have been reading chat. And by the way, I just,

08:55.580 --> 08:59.180
we had a hype train going and you all have been very generous with your bits and subs.

08:59.180 --> 09:03.260
So I just want to, you know, usually, you know, we don't read those live. Like most Twitch streamers

09:03.260 --> 09:06.620
will stop what they're doing and acknowledge that. But since we are taping a podcast,

09:06.620 --> 09:11.420
which of course you can download on iTunes, Spotify, all the places that you find podcasts,

09:12.220 --> 09:17.020
we don't usually stop for all those. But you know, when you all go above and beyond especially and

09:17.020 --> 09:20.220
do the hype trains and all that, I have to say something. So thank you for your generosity.

09:20.220 --> 09:24.540
I really appreciate that. But several people in chat noting that Loki behind you tonight,

09:25.100 --> 09:33.100
you have streaming some gameplay of Revolution X, the classic Aerosmith shooty bang, bang gallery

09:33.100 --> 09:38.540
game. Why Revolution X tonight? Is this because of their farewell tour that the tickets are going

09:38.540 --> 09:44.620
on sale or whatever? Oh yeah, I forgot about that. No, it's not about that. No, it's more of,

09:44.620 --> 09:48.460
I didn't know what I wanted to put behind me. And because I went to the Hard Rock

09:48.460 --> 09:56.540
casino last night to go see Ali Wong, I just thought, you know, music and yeah, it just kind of.

09:57.820 --> 10:01.660
No, that works. I haven't been out there at all. How is that venue? Is it nice out there?

10:02.140 --> 10:07.820
It's nice. I mean, it looks new for sure. I mean, I got tagged in a TikTok or something

10:07.820 --> 10:12.460
because they're doing an ABBA dance party up there. And I was like, oh, maybe. Yeah,

10:12.460 --> 10:18.380
they have something. They have something Drag Race related. Oh, the official Work the World Tour is

10:18.380 --> 10:24.060
going there. Yeah. Yeah. And like some Diana Ross thing as well. So like they kept like showing that

10:24.060 --> 10:28.780
like on the screens advertising the different venues they're coming. I'm tempted. Dark

10:28.780 --> 10:32.940
Sakurai. You want to go see? I don't even know who's on that tour, but I imagine it's all the

10:32.940 --> 10:39.340
queens. If Sasha Kolbe is on it, I mean, I'll go see mom. I haven't watched the last couple of

10:39.340 --> 10:45.260
seasons, so I might be behind a little bit. I might catch up. I rarely watch it anymore,

10:45.260 --> 10:50.140
but you know, you just, you see the clips are hard to dodge on social media, you know,

10:50.140 --> 10:56.380
of all the big moments. So. Especially with our crowd. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's get into news

10:56.380 --> 10:59.660
and what's going on in the gaming world. We're going to start off with this. Loki,

10:59.660 --> 11:02.380
I don't know if you want to talk about this. I have it up if you don't though.

11:02.380 --> 11:08.060
Yeah, I can talk about it. So it's more of Nintendo being Nintendo. So

11:09.340 --> 11:16.300
you may remember that not that long ago, like a week or two, there was a whole thing about Bowser

11:16.300 --> 11:24.060
and getting arrested for, you know, the whole creating mod chips and stuff for the Wii and

11:24.060 --> 11:29.100
all that. Not done Bowser, but another guy named Bowser. The third Bowser.

11:30.780 --> 11:37.660
Not the king of the Koopas. Bowser had seven kids, so let's not forget.

11:38.220 --> 11:44.060
All the Koopalings are getting in different lines of business. Yeah. So this one is in regards to

11:44.060 --> 11:51.020
the data DMCA takedown requests to GitHub to remove a piece of software called Lockpick,

11:51.020 --> 11:58.620
which is a tool for dumping your system keys from your own switch. The reason that people are upset

11:58.620 --> 12:04.940
about this because this does not actually prevent piracy that's been most prevalent with the switch,

12:04.940 --> 12:10.140
which is emulation because emulators don't need these keys in order to play games on it.

12:11.500 --> 12:16.940
And it's weird, though, that they're like even coming after this because this doesn't necessarily

12:16.940 --> 12:20.860
enable piracy either. It's just like it's a tool to do something.

12:22.620 --> 12:27.340
They want complete control, though. Yeah. I mean, Nintendo can't be happy. I mean,

12:27.340 --> 12:31.980
and I know you have a coupling story with this, but I think a lot of people that follow gaming

12:31.980 --> 12:38.060
know. Well, I think everybody that follows gaming knows that this Friday is a very big day in the

12:38.060 --> 12:43.100
Zelda universe. Obviously, the long wait for the sequel to Breath of the Wild is over. And Friday,

12:43.100 --> 12:50.620
Tears of the Kingdom comes out. And I bet there's multiple people in chat who have the day off work

12:50.620 --> 12:55.980
on Friday in acknowledgment of what's going on. And the reason why I bring that up is that

12:55.980 --> 13:02.460
obviously it's a huge target for piracy and no secret that it's already out there. So,

13:02.460 --> 13:07.580
you know, folks know to kind of watch out for spoilers on social media, careful with hashtags

13:07.580 --> 13:14.860
because people are, you know, dodging that stuff. DJRomaS in chat says, not me. I could care less

13:14.860 --> 13:23.100
about Zelda. Well, let me give a nice hearty, ooh, she's different to that. Yeah. I mean, like,

13:23.100 --> 13:28.460
no, no. I mean, real quick, though, real quick, though, I, I'm not going to pick that up. Here's

13:28.460 --> 13:32.540
the thing. Here's the thing. I'm not going to pick it up right away either because there's just,

13:32.540 --> 13:38.220
there's so much coming out right now that I'm like really interested in, uh, that, you know,

13:38.220 --> 13:43.900
I'll get to Zelda probably later this year. So I understand, I understand it isn't for everyone

13:43.900 --> 13:51.420
day one, but I also recognize this is like the series for some people. There are some people

13:51.420 --> 13:56.620
out there that don't care about most video games, but they care about Zelda, you know? So this is a

13:56.620 --> 14:02.220
big day for some folks. I get it. This would be like when Return of the Jedi came out in theaters.

14:02.540 --> 14:09.180
Yeah. For some. Yeah, for sure. But the thing is, is that, you know, Dan,

14:09.180 --> 14:13.660
I don't think is playing, I just got him Osmond. Um, but other than that, there's not really any

14:13.660 --> 14:19.500
major new gaming going on in my house. So it's perfect for us. You know, this, this,

14:19.500 --> 14:26.220
this Zelda release, this was Abba's voyage album being released. I, so, you know, for, for me and

14:26.220 --> 14:31.420
not everybody gave a shit. I understand. I respect that, you know, even though everybody, most people

14:31.420 --> 14:36.860
would probably say, Abba, yeah, very impactful on pop music, had a huge mark and so forth.

14:37.580 --> 14:40.700
So I could sit here and say the same thing about Zelda. I get it. I completely get it

14:40.700 --> 14:44.860
when people are losing their minds. Just me personally, probably, probably more towards

14:44.860 --> 14:47.900
the end of the year is when I'll get around to it. And we would just tell Abba thank you for

14:47.900 --> 14:52.940
the music. That's right. That's absolutely right. Anyway. Sorry, Loki. I know you're trying to make

14:52.940 --> 14:57.740
a point. No, no, it's fine. Um, no, it's just, I mean, yeah, it's gonna be a good game. I don't

14:57.740 --> 15:03.820
know if it's like earth shattering or anything. I mean, like, yeah, it's a sequel to, you know,

15:03.820 --> 15:11.100
breath of the wild. I watched Celtic play some of it, um, is of course under a partial NDA for,

15:11.100 --> 15:17.500
for some of it, but it looks really, really amazing. I mean, just the innovations that

15:17.500 --> 15:22.940
they've made for the system and everything and brought back a few things that had been in, uh,

15:23.500 --> 15:27.740
intended for the first release, they're able to do in this one and the world building.

15:28.540 --> 15:36.540
I have to say, I like the big thing about certain games for me is the immersive factor, you know,

15:36.540 --> 15:43.340
the, like the culture that was created inside this little universe, you know, it has a language,

15:43.340 --> 15:49.580
it has customs. You can follow the people around as they do stuff in their day, you know, and

15:49.660 --> 15:55.180
that's the kind of thing that I enjoy to see as I like learning more about a universe,

15:55.180 --> 16:00.300
about seeing its lore, you know? And I mean, which is part of the reason why I think I'm so

16:00.300 --> 16:07.740
big into Dead by Daylight, but, um, but that's, that's really the core of it for me is I'm,

16:07.740 --> 16:14.380
I'm excited for learning more about the universe. Now to generally kind of sum up what I, the

16:14.380 --> 16:18.620
discussion I see having in chat right now is that people seem to be on the same page that like

16:18.620 --> 16:23.100
the people that are breaking street date, you know, some people have been so bold as to stream

16:23.100 --> 16:29.580
it, which is a, you know, unless you are an authorized, because I believe they allowed

16:29.580 --> 16:33.660
press embargo to stream like an hour or two on a certain date. And I think that's what Dark

16:33.660 --> 16:37.660
Soccer is referring to too. That's, that's different, but the people that don't have that

16:37.660 --> 16:43.260
and are going beyond, you know, and so forth, uh, just trying to get, you know, internet points,

16:43.260 --> 16:47.420
cool points or something like, obviously people are just irritated with all that and putting out

16:47.420 --> 16:54.220
the spoilers. I think that they're allowing controlled exploration of certain areas.

16:55.020 --> 16:59.820
Probably. Yeah. And sometimes that's what companies will do is say, you may stream

17:00.540 --> 17:05.660
this area up to this point. Like sometimes it gets very specific. I know back when we used to get

17:05.660 --> 17:10.780
that kind of stuff, we would get that sometimes. They were letting Zeltik play ahead and it's,

17:10.780 --> 17:16.940
he's got a pretty long video about it, but there were certain things that he could show,

17:16.940 --> 17:21.660
but not talk about. Like it could be on the screen, but he wasn't allowed to call it out

17:21.660 --> 17:27.340
or certain things that could not be expressly talked about like certain game elements or

17:27.340 --> 17:32.380
different lore in the game. Cause it needed, and this is the whole thing that a company

17:33.180 --> 17:41.420
makes its impact by surprise. You know, the whole surprise and delight your, your customers thing.

17:42.300 --> 17:50.460
That's, I think Nintendo has been really good about, at least as far as what their,

17:50.460 --> 17:54.700
their products are concerned is that the moment that it comes out, it builds all this mystery

17:54.700 --> 17:58.700
around it. You have people leaking this stuff and there goes the mystery. They're not going

17:58.700 --> 18:03.100
to be so surprised, you know, where the person who doesn't know what they're going to get,

18:03.660 --> 18:08.140
but they have a reputation to go on. They're the ones who are going to be going out and

18:08.140 --> 18:14.620
buying it site and see unreviewed, you know, because it's something that they have particular

18:14.620 --> 18:22.700
trust in that brand and they want to be surprised. And I don't fault Nintendo for,

18:22.700 --> 18:29.820
for going all out on this one, you know, for really, really, you know, hammering down those,

18:29.820 --> 18:36.700
those leaks in the rumors because their whole bread and butter for a lot of their games is

18:36.700 --> 18:39.900
how much is it going to surprise and delight their audience?

18:40.620 --> 18:44.940
Well, speaking of bringing the hammer down, Loki, I think there's a second part of this too. And I

18:44.940 --> 18:50.700
saw it got brought up in chat too. Not even really like bringing a hammer down, just Reggie Fils-Aime

18:50.700 --> 18:57.660
memeing on stuff. So yeah, someone posted a screenshot of like, look, I see I'm playing

18:57.660 --> 19:02.300
Tears of a Kingdom on an emulator. And then of course he quoted Liam Neeson's, you know,

19:02.300 --> 19:08.380
Taken line, you know, I have a particular set of skills. I mean, yeah, it's cool, but like, okay,

19:08.380 --> 19:13.340
cool. But like, it's also one of those things where it's like, you know, you're fucking around

19:13.340 --> 19:18.780
and you about to find out. Like it's, it's one of those, like you, you knew what you were doing. So

19:20.380 --> 19:23.820
There is one thing you don't fuck with and that's that man's forehead.

19:24.860 --> 19:30.460
Or that man, period. Like you don't fuck with Reggie Fils-Aime period, end of sentence.

19:30.460 --> 19:37.980
Like, it's just, so yeah. Yeah. Mike Defton chat says that kid found out the hard way. Yes.

19:37.980 --> 19:42.540
Well, you know, speaking, okay, to kind of circle it back a little bit to the GitHub conversation

19:42.540 --> 19:47.260
and on the one hand, yes, I understand why Nintendo is being a little bit hypersensitive

19:47.260 --> 19:53.740
about emulators because, you know, it's not a great feeling to see this game break street

19:53.740 --> 19:59.580
date by at least a week and a half, if not more, with the people that are playing it and so forth.

19:59.580 --> 20:04.780
So I understand Nintendo is kind of doing a broad swipe. However, as you pointed out, you know,

20:04.780 --> 20:10.860
this, this particular component of getting your key does not in itself lend to piracy. And I think

20:10.860 --> 20:15.820
you said there, the emulators don't even require it. So they don't require it. And so like,

20:15.820 --> 20:21.340
that's the thing is like, that's if you want to play like using like your own system type of thing.

20:21.340 --> 20:28.140
But which still a matter of control though, it is. But I also kind of feel like the consumer,

20:28.140 --> 20:33.180
and this has been settled in a court of law is that the consumers do have the entitlement to

20:33.180 --> 20:39.180
make one backup copy for their purposes. It's just obviously you can't put that backup copy on

20:39.740 --> 20:44.140
torrent sites and say, Oh, whoops, sorry about that. You're entitled to make a backup copy for

20:44.140 --> 20:51.820
yourself. And to be fair to the folks that are doing this, the switch is dating technology.

20:51.820 --> 20:57.100
We all know that that's no secret. I think most people kind of accept that Tears of the Kingdom

20:57.100 --> 21:02.540
is probably going to push this thing about as far as it can go, because it already seems like

21:02.540 --> 21:07.020
it's been crying under the pressures of Pokemon, Scarlet Violet, and some of the other recent

21:07.020 --> 21:13.100
releases. So I, I kind of understand why someone might be like, and as long as they can do it in

21:13.100 --> 21:17.820
their own bubble, I'm not talking about streaming it. I'm not talking about putting it out on the

21:17.820 --> 21:23.340
internet. I'm talking about in their own bubble with their own tools on, on get access to,

21:23.420 --> 21:27.420
on get up, taking a copy of their game, playing it on PC and playing it with,

21:28.060 --> 21:35.820
you know, the upped, uh, either graphics or just the speed at which piece modern PCs can process

21:35.820 --> 21:40.460
as opposed to a switch. That's the thing too, is that you may run into a situation where you have

21:40.460 --> 21:46.460
a better experience playing emulated than you would on the, that's it. That's it. Because the

21:47.020 --> 21:54.300
good game, even though it's a $70 game, by the way, $70 game, and you know how great of a tracker

21:54.300 --> 22:03.340
we have at $70 games so far, you know, even if it is a big AAA publisher, like I know it's Nintendo,

22:03.340 --> 22:09.900
but I'm very skeptical that it's going to run smoothly.

22:09.900 --> 22:18.380
Here's the thing, ability to run as smooth as a PlayStation 5 or Xbox series game aside,

22:18.380 --> 22:27.820
that part aside, I do feel like if anybody is justified with that type of price for a day one

22:27.820 --> 22:35.660
release, hold on, it's probably Nintendo in this game. Reason being Nintendo games far more than

22:35.660 --> 22:41.420
their competitors lack those type of day one breaking bugs that you hear about in the games

22:41.420 --> 22:48.140
that other release and they tend to be very well-rounded packages out the gate. I'm sure

22:48.140 --> 22:54.220
this game will have DLC, but it's not going to feel like certain other games that release where

22:54.220 --> 22:58.940
it feels like the DLC is necessary to get the full scope of the game, if that makes sense.

22:58.940 --> 23:04.380
So my point being is that I feel like most of the complaints people have about companies releasing

23:04.380 --> 23:11.740
$70 games, like Nintendo, for better or for worse, doesn't seem to fall to those same issues.

23:12.300 --> 23:17.020
But then again, they've never charged $70 until now. So maybe things are going to change. I don't

23:17.020 --> 23:23.500
know. But I do feel like if anybody, Nintendo puts out the better product off the shelf than

23:23.500 --> 23:28.940
most of their peers in gaming, especially when you look at what's going on, you know, I know we'll get

23:28.940 --> 23:33.180
to it later in the show, but what was going on with Microsoft this week, you know, so.

23:34.620 --> 23:40.380
Let's see. Comments in chat. DJ Rama S says, if we were having this conversation like 10 years ago,

23:40.380 --> 23:44.380
I wouldn't have cared. I'd bootleg all the games. Fuck your feelings. But when you have friends who

23:44.380 --> 23:48.860
work in the industry and you learn more about the inner workings, can't support piracy. Yeah. And I

23:48.860 --> 23:53.260
want to make clear, we don't endorse piracy too. And everything I just said there, I'm talking

23:53.260 --> 23:59.740
about you with your Switch, your game, your PC. Sure. Maybe using some tools on GitHub,

23:59.740 --> 24:03.340
but it's, you're still buying the game. You're still buying everything you need to make it

24:03.340 --> 24:09.100
happen. You're just making it happen your own way, which I do feel like you ought to be able to do.

24:10.060 --> 24:18.220
So let's see. Other comments in chat. Mike Def does point out they did charge $70 in the 90s.

24:18.220 --> 24:21.580
You know, some of those cartridge games. That's why cartridge got to be an expensive format.

24:21.580 --> 24:26.620
That is a fair point. Dark Tetsuya says, I know there have been Nintendo games launching with

24:26.620 --> 24:31.420
issues, but I feel like it's few and far between. And usually not long before those issues are

24:31.420 --> 24:35.660
patched up. Oh yes. I was very, I chose my words very carefully there. And I didn't want to say

24:35.660 --> 24:41.100
these games launch with no issues. I wanted to say compared to their peers, they launched with

24:41.100 --> 24:48.220
the least amount of issues, I think is the better way to phrase that. So anyway. Loki,

24:48.220 --> 24:51.580
any other thoughts on that before we move on to our gaming weeks and all that?

24:52.300 --> 24:59.180
No, I just think Nintendo is still like, because emulation is legal. So like, I think

24:59.180 --> 25:04.860
attacking emulation, especially with GitHub, because they like GitHub is a smaller company.

25:04.860 --> 25:10.460
And Microsoft buy it, ironically? Um, I mean, guess so. But like, I was,

25:10.460 --> 25:15.100
I still assume that they're running kind of separately from Microsoft. So they're probably

25:15.100 --> 25:21.020
complying with a lot of these DMCA takedown notices without fighting it because, you know,

25:21.740 --> 25:26.860
they're not gonna stick their neck out to try to protect something that is been, you know, shown

25:26.860 --> 25:31.900
to have precedent to be safe and okay, they're just gonna take it down so they can have their

25:31.900 --> 25:37.100
safe harbor status. But also at the same time, I think some of these companies abuse that because

25:37.100 --> 25:40.700
they're like, well, what are they gonna do fight us on it, they're not gonna fight us on it,

25:40.700 --> 25:46.300
because we'll sue them if they fight us on it. And even if they may be entitled to do that or not.

25:46.300 --> 25:54.540
Like, for example, you know, when people are cease and desisting, like, just footed gameplay footage

25:54.540 --> 26:00.780
that appears online. Yeah, technically, it's your game and stuff. But like, I don't know, it's I

26:00.780 --> 26:05.180
feel like that that shouldn't just because your game leaked out. First off, just because your

26:05.180 --> 26:10.140
game leaked out. That's your fault. Honestly, like, it's your fault for staging your deliveries

26:10.140 --> 26:15.340
that damn early that it got leaked out. Why are you shipping this product to stores a week in

26:15.340 --> 26:20.860
fucking advance? Don't do that then. Because when I used to work at a distributor, like mom and pop

26:20.860 --> 26:25.420
stuff, which which they always blame the mom pop shops, but it's always the mass retailers that end

26:25.420 --> 26:30.140
up leaking that crap out. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. First off, because the mom pop shops are like,

26:30.140 --> 26:34.620
I ain't leaking this stuff out. Like I can hardly get this stuff on time, let alone you know,

26:34.620 --> 26:41.420
trying to get that like early, like a week early. Um, so it's big box for sure that to blame for

26:41.420 --> 26:47.020
that. I mean, track it down there. Like maybe you should not stage your stuff so damn early than if

26:47.020 --> 26:52.540
you're worried about it leaking out. Or like, implement something that you have to unlock it

26:52.540 --> 26:56.860
at a certain time. Like I know you do that digitally. But like, and I guess that doesn't

26:56.860 --> 27:02.220
necessarily work in, you know, if a console can't connect to the internet, but there's got to be a

27:02.220 --> 27:08.940
way that you could do something. Yeah, I wouldn't be easily defeated. But you know, I just, I don't

27:08.940 --> 27:15.100
get the blame on people stupid. I don't feel sorry for Nintendo about the the game leaking out early

27:15.100 --> 27:20.940
because you I think you illustrated it very well. How that happened. I do feel bad for the fans.

27:20.940 --> 27:26.300
Because inevitably human behavior, especially in a lot of pop culture, specifically nerd culture,

27:26.300 --> 27:31.900
including the umbrella of gaming, people have this desire to one up other people and prove that

27:31.900 --> 27:36.540
they're the coolest kid in town because they got to do said thing first. And sometimes people will

27:36.540 --> 27:42.380
do that by putting spoilers out there like, you know, the boat sinks or you know, those these

27:42.380 --> 27:50.220
types of big spoilers for games to assert them assert some type of strange dominance over others.

27:50.220 --> 27:54.860
And that's that's where I feel bad. But I don't feel bad for Nintendo. I feel bad for the fans.

27:55.580 --> 27:58.940
Because people don't know how to behave themselves. That's that's what it is.

27:59.900 --> 28:04.700
Um, let's see, actually, I want to mention this real quick too, before we get into gaming weeks,

28:04.700 --> 28:10.780
because E3VL asked a very good question that we all kind of run on an assumption on and we

28:10.780 --> 28:16.540
probably need to stop assuming that everybody knows things like this. E3VL says, what is GitHub

28:16.540 --> 28:23.500
anyway? Great question. GitHub is basically, as I understand it, a repository for code,

28:24.220 --> 28:30.060
especially for like people that want to work on something either transparent, transparently,

28:30.060 --> 28:36.060
or sort of crowdsource, you know, help with code. Now, obviously, this also means you can

28:36.060 --> 28:41.420
put code up there. And you know, everybody can grab it and compile it. Yeah, it's also

28:41.420 --> 28:47.900
different applications. It's also for like different. What's the actual terminology for

28:47.980 --> 28:53.980
it's, it allows you to basically store snapshots of your code. So for example,

28:53.980 --> 28:58.780
if I'm working on a project or something like that, I would send over here's my project or

28:58.780 --> 29:03.740
whatever that I've made. And then I make changes to it. And then I send another update to that.

29:03.740 --> 29:10.060
And then if something breaks, I can go back to it's basically a version history, store different

29:10.060 --> 29:16.140
revisions of your code. Yeah, sure, you can work on it collaboratively as well. But it's basically

29:16.140 --> 29:22.300
a repo site that you can just store versions of your code, you can see changes, you can,

29:23.180 --> 29:27.660
you know, fork it off. So like, if I wanted, if I was developing something, and someone wanted

29:27.660 --> 29:33.980
to take that as a base and develop something else, they could do that. Wikipedia, but for the project

29:33.980 --> 29:41.260
you're working on with code, basically, in a way, not really exact, like, I'm trying to, I'm trying

29:41.260 --> 29:46.540
to simplify it, though, for everybody, Loki, like, I know, there's, there's nuances. But also,

29:47.740 --> 29:52.780
and I kind of want to point out with this, the irony is, sure, Nintendo DMCAs GitHub,

29:52.780 --> 29:57.900
and I'm sure they took it down. But part of the reason why people put it up on GitHub in the first

29:57.900 --> 30:02.140
place is because now it's on the internet, everybody can literally grab the code and compile

30:02.140 --> 30:08.700
their own versions, like, Nintendo did nothing to stop the distribution of this. Because, and

30:08.700 --> 30:14.060
honestly, you know, and I love every, I know everybody loves to overuse that Streisand effect

30:14.060 --> 30:19.020
comparison. But that's what it is. And that is the whole like, when a company does something like

30:19.020 --> 30:25.660
this, they only shine a spotlight on it, because everybody reports on it. And that name comes from

30:25.660 --> 30:31.100
when Barbra Streisand tried to stop photos of her house being published, then everybody ran the

30:31.100 --> 30:37.020
story with a picture of the house in question. So it's that whole type of thing is that Nintendo

30:37.020 --> 30:42.460
probably only brought a spotlight to this tool. And what is because I, I never knew this was a

30:42.460 --> 30:46.300
thing. Until here, we are talking about it now. I never knew this was a thing.

30:46.300 --> 30:52.620
Yeah. And especially when you consider like, you know, that modding your console is probably going

30:52.620 --> 30:58.700
to be more risky than just downloading and playing the games on your PC. Plus, they'll run better.

30:58.700 --> 31:03.900
Plus, you can just run them off Steam Deck, which is going to run it just fine. And if there's more

31:03.900 --> 31:10.860
powerful Steam Deck type consoles or computers coming out, like, okay, cool. Now I don't need

31:10.860 --> 31:16.620
those keys. So what have you really done? You've you've driven people to now figure out, Oh, hey,

31:16.620 --> 31:21.820
this is way much easier than the other stuff. I'm just gonna do this instead. Yeah, less people

31:21.820 --> 31:27.900
buying. I gotta admit, I'm, I'm legit curious about how a switch game might run on my PC and

31:27.900 --> 31:32.620
how all I can bought it. Now I don't, I'm not going to be brazen enough to stream it or do

31:32.620 --> 31:37.980
anything. There's just for my own little tee-hees in my own little house. Like I, but now I'm like,

31:37.980 --> 31:44.780
wow, it sounds like Nintendo telling all these people to stop has only shown a spotlight on,

31:44.780 --> 31:50.220
like, there's all these really cool things modders and people are doing to these games that are,

31:50.220 --> 31:54.300
that are making them better in some ways. I mean, I guess it's opinion, but, you know,

31:55.500 --> 32:00.620
I'm curious about it more than anything, to be honest. So anyway. All right, let's move on.

32:00.620 --> 32:05.180
Let's talk about the things that struck our curiosity in our gaming weeks and the types

32:05.180 --> 32:09.260
of games that we have been playing this week. So let me go over to Dark Sakura and ask,

32:09.260 --> 32:15.740
how was your gaming week? I, of course, played Dead by Daylight. I started, well,

32:15.740 --> 32:22.300
continued on with my second playthrough of Marvel's Midnight Suns. My, my streaming days

32:22.300 --> 32:26.300
are going to change because of ballet. So I'm actually going to be starting two streams on

32:26.300 --> 32:29.500
Monday and I'm believing one of them is going to be cold to the lamb.

32:30.620 --> 32:36.940
Start over and play through the new DLC. I also played world cup soccer for pinball

32:37.580 --> 32:43.740
and I played Beatles because I freaking love it. That game is like a total asshole. And then it's

32:43.740 --> 32:48.860
a gentleman. It's like the one between it's either really nice to you and it suddenly hates you,

32:48.860 --> 32:54.220
or it just hates you the whole time. And then you suddenly have a good ball. Like I got denied my

32:54.220 --> 32:59.260
multi ball on my third ball and I was like, excuse me, what? All because I didn't make a ramp.

33:01.580 --> 33:07.820
I was like, dang. But, but yeah, and I'm trying to think of something new that I want to,

33:08.460 --> 33:15.260
you know, try out. I don't know. I've got a few things that I've acquired recently,

33:15.900 --> 33:22.860
but I may, depending on if anyone is able to play with me tonight, I may go back on my

33:23.500 --> 33:30.460
adept attempts for DBD. And you know, a lot of people have been asking like lately, you know,

33:30.460 --> 33:36.060
has the change to any of the, like the healing or any of that, you know, how do you feel about

33:36.060 --> 33:40.940
and I'm like, honestly, with the way I play, it hasn't changed a thing. It's still the same.

33:43.100 --> 33:49.740
So that's it. All right. Also, I just want to add, there's a really good video out there

33:49.820 --> 33:53.500
of how all the metas have changed over the course of the game being out.

33:54.220 --> 34:00.460
And people need to stop bitching. Okay. It used to be a lot worse. All I'll say to that is

34:01.100 --> 34:06.060
Infinite Freddy. The game, I mean, I've played a little bit of Dead by Daylight this week as well,

34:06.060 --> 34:12.780
and overall the game's in a decent place. I still think like some killers don't hold up well against

34:12.780 --> 34:22.300
others. Um, but also tunneling. My God is just, I have an idea. What do you think about this? And

34:22.300 --> 34:28.620
this is just a pie in the sky idea. What do you think that if somebody was the last person hooked

34:28.620 --> 34:34.860
and they get picked up again, maybe they get some type of increased wiggle, like their wiggling

34:34.860 --> 34:39.500
becomes stronger because they've been picked up back to back. I don't know. Just a, just a theory,

34:39.740 --> 34:45.740
like a built-in boil over type of thing. I like, I like that as an idea. And of course,

34:45.740 --> 34:51.740
my other one for camping was that the hook timer stops when the killer's in a certain

34:51.740 --> 34:58.300
distance from the hook. I'd support that too, for sure. So I think that's the one little tweak that

34:58.300 --> 35:04.380
would be great. Yeah. But the, like the perk metas seem like they're in a, like, I feel like

35:04.380 --> 35:09.260
there's nothing where it's like people have to take a certain thing anymore. Like, I feel like,

35:09.260 --> 35:13.420
you know, I'm sure some players would disagree with that assessment, but I feel like, again,

35:13.420 --> 35:17.660
like use it comparatively to where the game has been before much better, much better place.

35:17.660 --> 35:22.780
You know, the, the series of perks that I bring in, which is like typically botany knowledge,

35:22.780 --> 35:29.980
self-care balanced landing and, um, urban evasion. Nothing really has changed with those

35:29.980 --> 35:37.180
over the, since I've started playing survivor last year. Yeah. And they tend to be stable.

35:37.820 --> 35:43.660
They tend to be fair and they're good for me playing like a ninja because of my mouse.

35:44.300 --> 35:49.180
Not to get, not to get too far on DBD. Cause I know not everybody out there plays it,

35:49.180 --> 35:53.660
but I just want to say, you know, cause you know, it is an ongoing game. A lot of people play huge

35:53.660 --> 35:58.860
on Twitch. Um, I really love the perk distortion. I pretty much run it in every build right now

35:58.860 --> 36:02.780
because it suppresses auras for the killers. And there's a lot of killers that run things

36:02.780 --> 36:07.740
to read auras. So basically they can see where you are for a few seconds and distortion kind

36:07.740 --> 36:13.740
of suppresses that a certain amount of times in a match. Um, which is nice. Yeah. Um, I,

36:13.740 --> 36:20.060
I love that perk, but right now when I'm running solo queue, my favorite build to run is, uh,

36:20.060 --> 36:27.260
kindred bond, open-handed distortion. And what that does is that, uh, kindred allows everybody

36:27.260 --> 36:32.540
to see the killer and the other survivors when you're on a hook, but open-handed increases the

36:32.540 --> 36:38.860
aura range. So if a killer is proxy camping, you, you see it, you see, and this, this came into play

36:38.860 --> 36:46.540
on a match I did on, um, raccoon city with, um, I want to say it was a pig that was very obviously

36:46.540 --> 36:51.100
going around the hallways. Well, sorry, Jamie, I don't pick the killers. It was, uh, that was just

36:51.180 --> 36:59.260
patrolling the hallway back and forth, but because of kindred open-handed, my team could see how she

36:59.260 --> 37:04.780
would pace this way, pace that way, pace this way. So the minute she started pacing the other way,

37:04.780 --> 37:09.420
unhook run away the other way she wasn't pacing and it was great. So I love that perk for it.

37:10.460 --> 37:16.140
Yeah. Uh, well, my, my whole thing is that it's hard for me to go without my urban

37:16.140 --> 37:22.940
and my balance landing because those are because of how I have to play urban is like my bestie and

37:22.940 --> 37:26.780
you wouldn't believe the number of chases I've gotten out of with balance landing.

37:27.420 --> 37:30.940
Oh yeah. Balance landing's great. Or quick rescues.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.180
All right. And that was your DVD update. All right.

37:34.540 --> 37:38.140
Darsakra, do you think we may be one of these days we need to just give in and have a side

37:38.140 --> 37:43.420
to Dead by Daylight show? Well, I've already been thinking about it, but I kind of want to do

37:44.380 --> 37:48.220
one that's in character. Uh, yeah. And I, I always say,

37:48.220 --> 37:51.820
Oh, this show would be a great idea. And then I'm like, Oh, Rob, stop overextending yourself.

37:52.540 --> 37:55.740
Don't commit to anything. Well, I want you to be a character,

37:55.740 --> 37:59.500
but it means you don't have to do it all the time. Okay. That's fine. All right.

37:59.500 --> 38:05.580
Yeah. How good is your German accent? Who are you? Oh, Felix. You want me to be

38:05.580 --> 38:11.260
Felix? I'm thinking. All right. We'll see. I think it would be a hilarious Dwight.

38:11.260 --> 38:18.860
I can't speak German, but I can, if you like. Anyway, uh, Dark Knight asks, isn't there a new

38:18.860 --> 38:25.100
killer coming? Uh, if yeah, there's rumors out there. And if DVD stays on its current timetable,

38:25.100 --> 38:29.980
we should know in about three weeks who the next killer is. I'll just say so skip forward

38:29.980 --> 38:34.700
30 seconds. If you don't want to maybe spoiler, but potential spoiler out there, I'm assuming

38:34.700 --> 38:38.620
you already know this Darksakra. The new killer is rumored to be the singularity,

38:39.420 --> 38:43.020
which makes me think a robot type of killer. Maybe,

38:43.820 --> 38:46.540
Oh no, I was thinking maybe a commentary on AI or something.

38:47.180 --> 38:53.820
Singularities have to do with gravitational, uh, anomalies in space when the word singularity

38:53.820 --> 39:00.620
is typically being used. And so my thought is that we have our, an alien.

39:01.580 --> 39:07.900
Hmm. I'm not saying like aliens, you know, as in, you know, you know, xenomorphs,

39:07.900 --> 39:14.060
but I'm saying something that has like a black hole power or, or some sort of gravitational

39:14.060 --> 39:20.220
ability. Um, that would be my thought, uh, Dark Knight in chat says someone said, Megan,

39:20.220 --> 39:27.580
I fucking wish like, I talk a lot of shit. I talk a lot of shit about dead by daylight,

39:27.580 --> 39:33.660
but if by some grace of God, Megan were to become a killer in the game, like I, that's it. I will

39:33.660 --> 39:42.540
become a full-time dead by daylight streamer done. Or should I say period. Well, you know why they

39:42.540 --> 39:49.340
won't do Megan? Uh, kids. She appears to be a child. Yeah. Kids. A big reason that they're

39:49.340 --> 39:56.540
using the Japanese Sadako and not the stupid, you know, terrible movie Samara for Ringu because she

39:56.540 --> 40:03.340
was 19. And they did a grownup Yuichi. Yeah. And on top of that, did you, I might've said this

40:03.340 --> 40:09.900
before, but she is the first canonically intersex character in Dead by Daylight. Or a video game,

40:09.900 --> 40:14.780
I think. We'll see. Um, and Steve and Nancy are 18, even though they're in high school and

40:14.780 --> 40:20.460
stranger things in DVD canon, they are 18 years old. So yeah. Anyway, let's move on. Sorry,

40:20.460 --> 40:23.580
Loki. I know you're a big fan of dead by daylight, but what do you want to talk about?

40:24.140 --> 40:29.100
Oh, I was going to say, if it was going to be the singularity and you're saying robot, the first,

40:29.100 --> 40:36.380
the only thing that comes to mind is of course, uh, the oral knots rendition of C-3PO,

40:36.380 --> 40:41.820
who always talks about the singularity, uh, creepy-o. So that would have been hilarious.

40:41.820 --> 40:46.940
Imagining like an, an evil C-3PO killing people. No, we would've got that.

40:46.940 --> 40:53.100
There wasn't, there was an evil protocol droid in the old extended universe for Star Wars,

40:53.100 --> 40:57.100
if I remember correctly. May the 4th came and went. That was the perfect opportunity

40:57.100 --> 40:59.820
to say something like that. If that was ever going to be a thing.

40:59.820 --> 41:03.980
And we've passed both revenge days, the revenge of the fifth and the revenge of the sixth.

41:03.980 --> 41:10.460
Yes. Yes. So Dark Knight says maybe the Terminator. I, I don't think it's going to be

41:10.460 --> 41:14.380
licensed, but I obviously I'd eat that kind of stuff up to be honest.

41:15.100 --> 41:24.940
Terminator was already licensed to, um, uh, but characters, characters get licensed multiple

41:24.940 --> 41:29.180
times. Sometimes it doesn't have to, it depends on the contracts, of course, but like, you know,

41:29.180 --> 41:33.740
the stranger things stuff. Well then they unlicensed it. So, but, uh, Texas Chainsaw

41:33.740 --> 41:39.260
Massacre, they've, they've dug their heels in saying that despite the upcoming game for Texas

41:39.260 --> 41:44.300
Chainsaw Massacre, that they're not pulling Leatherface from a DVD. So, but I wish they

41:45.260 --> 41:47.660
playing him and I play it, hang again, playing against him.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.460
All right. Let's talk about other games.

41:50.460 --> 41:54.060
We'll get, we'll get Dracula and Renfield. That'd be funny. Um,

41:55.900 --> 42:01.900
so let's see. I played, of course, a DDR extreme this week. I played not a lot of it,

42:01.900 --> 42:06.140
uh, like 30 minutes because it took me some time to get the cabinet hooked back up.

42:06.140 --> 42:10.940
Um, I was having issues where I wasn't getting any video and that's because I forgot that it

42:10.940 --> 42:16.700
goes through a board to do that. And I had it plugged in the wrong spot. So I finally got that

42:16.700 --> 42:21.500
all working and everything works great. And I'm very excited that the cabinet is not broken

42:21.500 --> 42:29.980
because that would make me very sad. Um, then of course, uh, lots of Minecraft. So I like really

42:29.980 --> 42:35.340
grinded Minecraft this week. I was trying to get my video out this weekend, but I got sidetracked

42:35.340 --> 42:42.300
with other things I have to do first. So a part of that is developing a mod. That's going to work

42:42.300 --> 42:50.780
with, um, the stuff that we have right now in channel 64 to help bring in the custom 3d models

42:50.780 --> 42:57.180
I have for the robot masters themselves. So I finally finished that. I mean, there's about 99%

42:57.180 --> 43:02.300
done today. I it's working at the tweak, some of the models so that they look nicer and everything.

43:02.300 --> 43:06.700
Um, and I got to go commission the rest of those cause I only have the first three done,

43:06.700 --> 43:11.420
but yeah, lots of building. Like I did a ton of building this week. It was

43:12.780 --> 43:19.420
just really large builds, three of them. I, I built another giant mega man enemy, which I've

43:19.420 --> 43:23.900
already kind of teased that out there on the internet and stuff. So it's, it's awesome.

43:24.540 --> 43:29.980
Um, and I just need to edit my video now, uh, which is going to be this week. I'm just trying

43:29.980 --> 43:36.620
to keep up cause like I'm, I have to keep some base to get done by like, we were targeting only

43:36.620 --> 43:43.100
a certain more, like a certain amount of time left in the season. It's still a lot of time,

43:43.100 --> 43:48.380
but I got a lot to, I need to do. Oh, cool. My camera. I was just about to say you had a weird

43:48.380 --> 43:55.420
hiccup. Like, uh, I thought it was, uh, um, uh, internet like spike, but I think you might've had

43:55.420 --> 44:01.340
a brownout or something. That was weird. No, no, nothing's flashing over here. Weird. Just the

44:03.020 --> 44:07.820
I'll do it. Do we do turn it off, turn it back on again? That's usually the trick. All right.

44:08.780 --> 44:13.340
Um, well, really quick while you're playing with that, let me ask you about this because you're

44:13.340 --> 44:20.300
like the, um, Minecraft guy around here. Minecraft legends. I know that just came out. Is that

44:20.300 --> 44:26.220
something I should, you know, be caring about or pass? Like what's, what's the deal with Minecraft

44:26.220 --> 44:33.820
legends? Um, it looks interesting. It's like an, and I guess like a more like a real time strategy

44:33.820 --> 44:42.860
game, but it's also, um, I don't know. It's, it's not like in the same sense as, um, like a command

44:42.860 --> 44:50.460
and conquer or something like that. It's more of like a, um, I don't know. I really don't play a

44:50.460 --> 44:55.740
lot of real time strategy games. Okay. I don't know what's up with the camera. It's the software.

44:55.740 --> 45:02.220
It just keeps crashing. So I don't know. I mean, I could just put no background, but no one wants

45:02.220 --> 45:11.580
to see that. Um, so basically just, I haven't really played it too much, but you, you build

45:11.580 --> 45:17.020
different structures that then allow you to create units and you use those units kind of

45:17.020 --> 45:21.660
like direct them to go do stuff. And as far as like gathering resources, you have your allies

45:21.660 --> 45:26.300
that go and collect resources from a certain area. I don't know. It didn't really seem that

45:26.300 --> 45:32.940
interesting to me. And honestly, like the more I saw of it, it's still not very interesting. I

45:32.940 --> 45:37.260
hear it's fun and it's probably worth checking out at least on game pass because it's free.

45:38.140 --> 45:42.540
Well, it's not free. You're paying for game pass, but it's included with game path. So,

45:43.500 --> 45:48.060
you know, it'd be worth checking out for that. Um, is it something that I would play like longterm?

45:48.060 --> 45:52.220
Eh, I don't know. Like I'd be more interested in Minecraft dungeons than it. And I haven't

45:52.220 --> 45:56.460
even played Minecraft dungeons yet. I play a little bit of Minecraft dungeons. I enjoy it.

45:56.460 --> 46:00.380
It's good. Yeah. That looks fun. Um, it's just legends. Like I just don't,

46:01.340 --> 46:08.220
I don't know. It seems weird. Like just the, the way it's set up. Like I wish it was more

46:08.220 --> 46:12.540
like a traditional RTS game where it's like, that's why I used to love doing like with

46:12.540 --> 46:16.620
command and conquer red alert is just, I wouldn't even really play. I mean, I would play through all

46:16.620 --> 46:22.700
the story missions and stuff, but my most favorite thing doing was just creating skirmish matches

46:22.700 --> 46:27.660
where you just have a random map or you create your own map and then you just put you, okay,

46:27.660 --> 46:31.260
I'm going to have one faction here, one faction here, one faction here. And you just all play

46:31.260 --> 46:35.660
against the AI stuff. And it was a lot of fun. Like I used to do that for hours, but

46:37.180 --> 46:42.220
this, I just, I don't know. Not really interested in it. I don't know why.

46:42.220 --> 46:46.940
Uh, Minecraft dungeons is good. It's, it's basically an ARPG, a very competent one,

46:46.940 --> 46:53.180
uh, that is meant to be played on a controller. It's a, it's a lot of fun. I like it. So yeah.

46:53.180 --> 46:59.500
All right. Well, um, if you're all done, uh, then I will go to my gaming week. So my gaming week,

46:59.500 --> 47:05.580
um, let's see, my gaming week was, uh, I played a little more final fantasy one pixel remaster

47:05.580 --> 47:12.700
because I actually completed the platinum trophy. So I have now platinum two games on PlayStation

47:12.700 --> 47:17.820
with Diablo three and now final fantasy one pixel remaster. Uh, all I had to do was hunt down a

47:17.900 --> 47:23.660
warmack, which is like a one in 64 spawn in the last dungeon where you get Tiamat. And that was

47:23.660 --> 47:29.260
it really, uh, the other things were very easy to pick up. So, um, yeah, that was, that was that.

47:29.260 --> 47:35.980
And then pretty much, uh, the majority of my week, otherwise I started playing final fantasy origin

47:35.980 --> 47:41.100
stranger of paradise. That was the other big game I started playing. And, uh, this game has

47:41.100 --> 47:45.900
been interesting. So I I've kind of stayed away from it until it dropped in price. And at some

47:45.980 --> 47:51.100
point it finally did come down to 20 bucks. So it's been on sale, I think like permanently or

47:51.100 --> 47:56.860
whatever to 40 bucks. And then some places put it on sale, like target, Amazon, et cetera,

47:56.860 --> 48:01.820
for 20 bucks. And I think I mentioned this on the show last week, I picked up the PS4 version

48:01.820 --> 48:07.180
because it has a free upgrade to PS5. So I've been playing it a little bit and I am enjoying it. Um,

48:07.180 --> 48:12.460
I like the combat system and how they incorporate the final fantasy jobs into it a lot.

48:12.460 --> 48:16.380
I like that you can flip back and forth between like, Oh, I'm a red mage. Oh,

48:16.380 --> 48:23.740
now I'm a Ninja. Like you can do that except you are limited to only two until you stop and you

48:23.740 --> 48:28.860
get to the cubes on a map that you can change it. So it is a little bit limited in what you can do,

48:28.860 --> 48:35.820
but, um, you know, I, I understand there are some technical limitations or what have you with that.

48:35.820 --> 48:41.260
So, um, that's, that's a bummer. Otherwise, like some of the maps are really cool. And what I didn't

48:41.260 --> 48:48.060
realize that this game does is it actually, even though the story is basically an alternate

48:48.060 --> 48:55.500
universe type of final fantasy one story, it actually incorporates maps from other final

48:55.500 --> 49:02.620
fantasy games. Um, like for example, one of the early areas you go to says, this is like dimension

49:02.620 --> 49:08.860
14, where the pirates hang out and dah, dah, dah. And it's because it's, uh, the pirate fight from

49:08.860 --> 49:13.420
final fantasy one, which is in the town of Provoca early on you fight a pirate. Well,

49:13.420 --> 49:18.540
what they did, they took the final fantasy 14, Cistosia dungeon, which was a pirate layer in

49:18.540 --> 49:23.500
that game and made it like the map that you go through to get to the pirate that you fought in

49:23.500 --> 49:27.980
Final Fantasy one. And like, there's another map later on that was from Final Fantasy 13,

49:27.980 --> 49:32.460
and it has the weather mechanics. If you've ever played 13, there's that map with the orbs that

49:32.460 --> 49:37.020
turn it from rainy to sunny. So I think that is actually one of the coolest things that final

49:37.020 --> 49:42.060
fantasy origins kind of brings to the table is yes, it's a retelling of one, but it incorporates

49:42.060 --> 49:48.460
the other games. The story itself is just as ridiculous and over the top as all the trailers

49:48.460 --> 49:54.300
made it out to be. Um, it kind of, you kind of notice that maybe some corners were cut on some

49:54.300 --> 50:01.660
things they couldn't pull off. Like you talk to NPCs on the map, the main map, you just hit start

50:01.660 --> 50:06.700
talk. And then like all these different NPCs, like, I feel like there's a town mechanic that

50:06.700 --> 50:11.340
was just removed. Uh, for whatever reason, maybe they come and pull it off. I don't know. Also,

50:11.340 --> 50:19.500
my biggest annoyance with the game, there's no map. Really? There's no map? Like what year is

50:19.500 --> 50:26.060
it? 2023. I can't hit a button and get a map. Give me a break. So, but otherwise overall, I am

50:26.060 --> 50:33.420
enjoying the game enough as, you know, transparent as the story may be. And, you know, as tunnely as

50:33.420 --> 50:38.460
some maps might feel, I don't know. I don't get as frustrated with it, but, um, I think I would

50:38.460 --> 50:44.460
have maybe thought 70 was too much, but 40 is fine. 20 is better than five, but 40 is fine.

50:44.460 --> 50:49.580
So, um, that's, that's my take on stranger paradise. I saw much more of the game to finish.

50:49.580 --> 50:54.060
I've only gotten through like maybe five. I haven't even got the first, I think I'm on the

50:54.060 --> 50:59.820
map to get the first crystal, but I've done every side quest off stream. So I'm trying to like

50:59.820 --> 51:05.020
stream my gameplay, but I do all the side quests off stream. So yeah, that's, that's been a

51:05.020 --> 51:10.620
change your paradise. All right. Um, we're going to get into some more news and what else is going

51:10.620 --> 51:16.860
on in the gaming world this week. So we'll go over to you, Loki. All right. Sounds good. Um,

51:16.860 --> 51:26.460
so this week we had, um, some disappointment, red fall, uh, the big first party supposed to be

51:26.460 --> 51:32.780
banger of a game came out. Um, and it was not, not, it was not a good game.

51:32.780 --> 51:35.740
Well, um, I want to point something important now. I'm sorry. I don't mean to cut you off, but

51:36.940 --> 51:42.940
in the, in the eyes of critics and the pulse on social media, it doesn't appear to be a good game.

51:42.940 --> 51:46.860
The only reason I'm putting it that way is because I've had people that have come into my chat that

51:46.860 --> 51:51.420
are like, red falls fine. Once you get past the first 45 minutes, like it sounds like it might

51:51.420 --> 51:54.460
have a rough introduction, but once you kind of get past the first part of it, like there's some

51:54.460 --> 51:58.380
people that are like, this isn't as bad as people are saying it is. No, it's technical issues. I

51:58.380 --> 52:03.900
think it's actually, it's not so much the story. It's just that the world is empty. A lot of times

52:03.900 --> 52:13.820
the AI is bad. The gunplay is bad. The frame rate is bad. Um, it's, it's a lot of things.

52:13.820 --> 52:18.700
It's not just like, well, you know, it's not like a Saint's row. Well, I mean,

52:18.780 --> 52:24.620
Saint's row is bad too, but, um, it's, it's not one that's like, you know, subjectively bad. It was

52:24.620 --> 52:30.700
just that like tech, it's a, it's a fallout 76, basically. It's, um,

52:30.700 --> 52:35.340
That might be an interesting comparison. You could, you could, well, it's also Bethesda,

52:35.340 --> 52:43.500
you could, um, enjoy it, but it's a slog to get through all that stuff to enjoy it really

52:43.500 --> 52:51.740
for a $70 game. And the Polish that the studio has been known for in Dishonored and, um,

52:51.740 --> 52:57.740
time loop. And, or what was it? Uh, what was the game that they had before that? Death loop? Yeah,

52:57.740 --> 53:03.020
that's right. Death loop. Yeah. Um, death loop, you know, that had, those were very polished

53:03.020 --> 53:08.620
games. And now this comes out and it's like, not so much. So because of that, you know,

53:08.620 --> 53:12.940
Just quickly, some comments from chat. I'm sorry. Uh, DJ Rama S says, most people I know that got

53:12.940 --> 53:17.660
the game, said it's pretty good. Meesh says, I honestly liked it. Questbuster says, as a fan of

53:17.660 --> 53:22.220
Arcane, it was disappointing to see what their reactions in general were. Some streamers did

53:22.220 --> 53:26.620
play it through to the end, if only because they wanted to see where the story went. One of the

53:26.620 --> 53:32.300
terms I had heard about the game is that it was aggressively mid, you know, and I wonder, and I,

53:32.300 --> 53:37.420
I've kind of seen this take online too. I can't take credit for this, but I feel like I'm getting

53:37.420 --> 53:43.500
a sense that people that paid $70 for it, not happy. People that are getting it included with

53:43.500 --> 53:50.300
game pass, content. Because they didn't have to pay anything extra for it. And I think I could

53:50.300 --> 53:54.860
see where that is definitely a reality is that, yeah, if you didn't spend 70 bucks on this game,

53:54.860 --> 53:57.660
and it's just part of this monthly thing that's in your budget anyway, you're probably like,

53:57.660 --> 54:03.260
oh, this is cool. This is a fun distraction for a little while. Just a thought. Yeah.

54:04.220 --> 54:10.860
Of course, you know, folks are kind of upset with how it turned out. And, you know, Phil Spencer,

54:10.860 --> 54:16.140
you know, kind of took, you know, responsibility for that and basically said, you know, there's

54:16.140 --> 54:22.220
nothing more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community just to kind of watch the

54:22.220 --> 54:26.540
community lose confidence. Be disappointed. I'm disappointed. I'm upset with myself.

54:27.100 --> 54:31.820
Um, you know, basically saying, you know, I think back to the announcement of 60 FPS,

54:32.700 --> 54:36.860
and then we weren't shipping 60 FPS. That was kind of a punch right to the chin

54:37.820 --> 54:42.300
a couple weeks ago, and then seeing the game come out and the critical response was not what we

54:42.300 --> 54:47.900
wanted. It was disappointing. So I kind of picked myself up and what can we learn? How can we get

54:47.900 --> 54:53.980
better? One things that I'll fight is a sort of what we want, or sort of what went wrong.

54:53.980 --> 54:59.820
There's clearly a quality and execution of things that we can do. But one thing I will not do is

54:59.820 --> 55:04.620
push against the creative aspirations of our teams. I know a lot of people will say, hey,

55:04.620 --> 55:09.260
you've got teams, teams know how to do one kind of thing and just force them to do one kind of thing.

55:09.260 --> 55:14.540
Well, yeah, I agree with that. Because, you know, obviously, that's not necessarily bad,

55:14.540 --> 55:18.620
you know, sure, you should give the teams the creative freedom to make the type of games that

55:18.620 --> 55:23.580
they want. But then again, you should also not force them to make games that they're not used to

55:24.060 --> 55:31.900
a, you know, what was it? I can't, I can't, well, let me, why are you sitting on that? Let me just

55:31.900 --> 55:38.140
say like the the thing I will credit Phil Spencer with here and big kudos, quite honestly, is that

55:38.140 --> 55:44.860
at least he takes responsibility for the issue. He doesn't try to deflect it onto it was this

55:44.860 --> 55:50.620
other thing or it was the team or I was, you know, but he takes accountability. And you know what,

55:50.620 --> 56:00.140
I'm gonna be honest, name another US executive that does that in gaming. Nobody, you can't.

56:00.140 --> 56:05.900
Japan, you can, you know, we had, of course, Iwata, the infamous pay cut, Miyamoto with the

56:05.900 --> 56:11.260
Wii U underperformed, took a pay cut. That's why people have a lot of respect on Iwata's name and

56:11.260 --> 56:16.300
remember him fondly. But I digress, you know, this this is about certainly and you look at a

56:16.300 --> 56:23.260
lot of other CEOs running companies over here and it's not it's a lot of refusing to take

56:23.260 --> 56:29.020
accountability for anything. Obviously, I'm shining a fucking spotlight laser beam on Bobby

56:29.020 --> 56:35.980
Kotek with this, right? Not being able to take accountability. Now that said, like, I get it

56:35.980 --> 56:44.460
that he's taking accountability for that. But yeah, there is a but but but not only is the game

56:44.460 --> 56:50.460
back, you know, like technically not polished enough, but they knew it because they didn't

56:50.460 --> 56:58.060
allow him they embargoed the game reviews until after the game came out. They did not give pre

56:58.060 --> 57:04.300
release code out to these publications. So they they tried to control the narrative and not let

57:04.300 --> 57:12.060
people know how bad of shape the game was in at launch. Yeah, no, I can say kudos to Phil Spencer

57:12.060 --> 57:17.580
for taking accountability. But at the same time, you ultimately allowed this game to go out to the

57:17.580 --> 57:24.780
wolves. Like, yes, you have to also be accountable for that. And there's some other you know, a lot

57:24.780 --> 57:29.660
of comments about the QA team and chat She-Hulk also with this comment here, which is I think,

57:29.660 --> 57:33.740
you know, the approach a lot of people would have She-Hulk 10 and chat says it is in a pre

57:33.740 --> 57:39.660
alpha stage game, but in six years 2029, it will be a classic. And you know, Phil Spencer talked

57:39.660 --> 57:45.100
a lot in that statement about story and creative freedom and that's not the complaints I'm hearing

57:45.100 --> 57:50.620
about the game. I'm maybe I'm reading the wrong things. I'm not hearing complaints about the story

57:50.620 --> 57:55.180
or what the game is trying to do. I'm hearing complaints about technical.

57:55.180 --> 58:01.500
Even the presentation of the story is not great. Because like the way they did it is like, this is

58:01.500 --> 58:07.180
once again $70 title, you look at like other games that they've done like Dishonored and whatnot,

58:07.180 --> 58:13.900
they've got like real time kind of cutscene type stuff that there's like voice acting and

58:13.900 --> 58:18.700
everything in that their stories that they had here were done kind of like a slideshow.

58:19.900 --> 58:23.660
It's like ridiculous. It's like a slideshow not even like a comic thing. But it's like

58:23.660 --> 58:28.860
it was still frames that they slightly move across the screen and stuff like that. Like,

58:28.860 --> 58:33.020
that's not even necessarily like a pre presentation, like a stylized presentation

58:33.020 --> 58:39.180
or anything like that. It's just, well, we just didn't want to animate these scenes. And so the

58:39.180 --> 58:44.460
cut time, you know, development time, we're just going to put it out like this. Like it just it

58:44.460 --> 58:51.660
screams like corners cut. And, and it's not even I wouldn't even blame the QA team this surely the

58:51.660 --> 58:56.780
QA team knows about all these issues. It's more of like what they had to prioritize. And they

58:56.780 --> 59:01.260
forced them to get it out when they did. And I mean, we've got a story coming out a little

59:01.260 --> 59:05.660
later on talking about some other future like announcements from Microsoft and stuff. But like,

59:05.660 --> 59:10.220
it almost feels like that that's necessary now because people are like, well, if this is bad,

59:11.500 --> 59:16.620
the other big game this year is starfield. That's also Bethesda and Bethesda games are like,

59:17.820 --> 59:18.700
here's, you know,

59:18.700 --> 59:23.900
here's the other thing and that take to go back to she hoax comment about is this a game that can be

59:23.900 --> 59:29.340
rescued? Can it be the next Diablo three fantasy 14 destiny and this growing list of games that

59:29.340 --> 59:35.580
got fixed after they were released? Can it be this? It could be, but here's my concern she

59:35.580 --> 59:41.100
hulk and anybody else out there on these thoughts. Here's my concern. I feel like this game was

59:41.100 --> 59:46.540
willingly thrown out to the wolves. I'm not sure I can piece together why yet, but here's the thing

59:46.540 --> 59:52.060
is that starfall has been, or has been delayed, or excuse me, starfield has been delayed how many

59:52.060 --> 01:00:00.700
times other X X-Box titles have been delayed how many times. So I feel like they'll delay. And in

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:05.820
fact, red fall was even delayed at least once. Wasn't it? So I pushed us to the summer a little

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:12.140
bit. They're willing to delay games to get it right. But for some reason they didn't do it with

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:20.300
this. And I wonder if this was the sacrificial lamb to counter the audience. And, and I think

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:26.380
E3VL nails it. They probably needed to release something due to investors. And I actually think

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:33.420
that it, I think nail that's the head. I think they had to say, yo, we've got to release something

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.780
now because otherwise people are going to start unsubscribing from game pass. There's nothing to

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:44.380
play on it. Although I think HiFi rush was a great addition, but I get it. You can't let HiFi rush

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:48.780
is not going to fund game pass for 12 months, but you know, I get it. There's gotta be these

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:53.980
big releases, but there's a part of me that can't help but feel this was the sacrificial lamb to

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:59.660
get people to stop bitching. The Microsoft isn't doing anything. Well, it's not helping that you

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:05.740
had these 10 pull titles. So this in Starfield this year, plus also the acquisition of Activision

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:10.700
Blizzard. Well, the Activision Blizzard thing is kind of falling through right now. This isn't very

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:17.420
strong. It all's now pinned on Starfield. If that's not strong. But there's, there's Forza,

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:23.740
there's Fable, there's Setsuna's Revenge. There's all these games Microsoft's had in the pipeline

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:29.900
for a very long time. But like, look at these acquisitions, though, like what, what good has

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:36.060
it done? Like, you know, so far, we have our first thing from Bethesda, which has not been strong.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:40.940
And whereas the studio has been strong in the past, this particular portion of Bethesda. I mean,

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:46.540
I was gonna say HiFi rush was also Bethesda. I would say that was probably the best thing in the

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:53.580
first three months of this year. So it was pretty good. Yeah, some you lose some. I'll say I'll say

01:01:53.580 --> 01:02:00.060
it was a great argument for game pass. In some ways, as is this. Again, I go back to what I said

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.060
before, if you paid 70 bucks for this, you're pretty pissed off probably. But if you got it as

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:09.820
a part of game pass, you're not bothered. Yeah, exactly. You're you're you're less bothered by

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:14.220
because it's like, well, that's fine. I'll just go play something else that there's tons of things on

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:19.580
there. Like, I don't it's Yeah, that certainly helps. It certainly helps with the conversation

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:26.060
of all these games being $70 too. I mean, because that game pass was like 15 bucks a month, you know,

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:31.980
that's already like a quarter of the year or third year. And then some five months at least,

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:38.300
you know that you have here for just the price of one game. I mean, you can definitely play a game

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:43.900
within that time. The other thing, of course, you know, along with that, he made comments talking

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:48.220
about, you know, because of this, you know, even starfield, you know, being on the platform, he

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:52.380
doesn't feel that that's enough to get people that can, you know, basically trade in their PlayStation

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.700
fives for a series X or S. I mean, who's gonna really trade in their system? I think most people

01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:02.140
buy a second system. But But yeah, I think it's more of a long game for a lot of these studios

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.500
that they purchase, you know, once all these titles come out, they'll probably, you know,

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.820
build a bolster everything. I mean, not everything is gonna be perfect. Like Redfall to me wasn't

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.260
very exciting of a game anyways, leave it even when they were talking about the preview. Yeah,

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:19.420
it wasn't really on my radar either. That's why I'm not super bothered by a lot of this. Like,

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:25.980
yeah, exactly. Like if starfield's garbage, then yeah, I'll be disappointed if starfield isn't

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:31.740
good. But like, I mean, I fully expect we know Bethesda proper to have a certain amount of jank

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:37.660
to their games. And that's just, that's the charming part, right? It's charming. Like when

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.900
it's not like game breaking, like if it's just like, just charming jank.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:47.420
It's community theater. So sometimes some of the some of the bad acting you're inevitably

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.860
going to see in community theater is part of the charm, right? It's just like, it's just like,

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:57.580
was it Saints Row now? Like, so gearbox has been pushing, you know, volition. Saints Row's got a

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:02.620
bunch of updates that are coming out in DLC, that they're seeing that they're fixing the game. And

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:09.100
like, I don't even want to look at it anymore. Like it, this game is not even like, it's just

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:15.500
bad. Like it's not, it's not stupid jank like it, like the older games were, but it's just,

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:21.580
it's bad. It's bad jank. It's not a good jank. Yeah, I get it. All right. Anyway, I think we've

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:24.540
talked a lot about that. Let's move on. We have some more stories to get through for tonight.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:30.220
Let's talk about another game that is coming out really soon. It's kind of wild how fast June is

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:36.380
creeping up on us with all these releases and it's Final Fantasy XVI. And Final Fantasy XVI

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:44.300
apparently has been banned in Saudi Arabia of all places. And why is Final Fantasy XVI being banned

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:51.820
in Saudi Arabia? Because apparently it has to do with LGBTQ content. In fact, one tweet went so far

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:58.460
as to say there is an explicit gay sex scene in Final Fantasy XVI and that is why it was banned

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.700
in Saudi Arabia. I'm going to call that out right now and say that is not the truth.

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:10.380
That is not Squares MO. That is not Squares MO. And here's the thing. I think that is a

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:14.860
miss. I don't want to say mistranslation, but I think that's a misunderstanding of the word

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:23.100
explicit because I bet Saudi Arabia called it explicit in their review because two men.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.940
Yeah, two men pecking.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.100
Is the Final Fantasy VII remake banned there too?

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.220
I mean there's cross-dressing.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:40.460
Yeah, it's true. So I believe that maybe the review board in Saudi Arabia called it explicit,

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:45.740
but I think we all know that if a guy is giving another guy a hug or saying I love you or

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.980
something, that's not explicit. And I'm sorry, this is not going to have two dudes going at

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:55.180
it behind the Chocobo stable. That is not what this is, okay?

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.500
Are they going to play the Chocobo team now?

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:57.900
What's that?

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:07.660
Let's get... You know what? Not that I would ever do Boilesque, but if I did,

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.780
that's going to be my song.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:17.100
Mike, do you see what Mike said?

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.820
Mike Defton chat called it Choco Back Mountain.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:28.300
You know what? How many of you in chat? Put one in chat if you

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:33.340
would get on the stripper pole to Crazy Chocobo. All right.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.240
Anyway.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:41.980
That depends on the first part. Would I get on a stripper pole?

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.860
All right. Thank you all for the ones in chat. Thank you. All right. Here's the thing.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:52.300
And here's my serious point with it is that I think there's been a rumor for a little bit

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:58.860
now that this game is going to have an openly gay character in it. And so this type of banning makes

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.380
it seem like, okay, this is just confirmation that yes, we're going to have an openly gay

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:08.060
character in the game. No, they're not going to be boating. It's just, there's a guy probably

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:13.180
having a love thing for another guy in the game. Cool. I would say it's the first openly gay

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.780
character in Final Fantasy because I don't think it's the first gay character in Final Fantasy

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:24.220
because you're not going to change my head canon. Fang and Vanille, they were not just sisters,

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:29.020
okay, in Final Fantasy 13. All right. Everybody kind of reads differently into it and that's

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:35.900
fine. But this will be the first game of openly gay character. However, usually at this point,

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:42.300
because I love the Final Fantasy series, I love the fact that this is June and this game is

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:47.660
literally releasing Pride Weekend. I just want to say, usually I'd be busting out the confetti

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:53.900
cannons and the rainbow flags going, hooray, this is wonderful representation. I'm roadblocked a

01:07:53.900 --> 01:08:02.140
little bit because I feel I can't celebrate because whereas they may have done a good thing

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:07.740
here, we all know they did a not great thing when it came to racial representation and the response

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:15.580
to said thing. And that continues to be an issue. As I've stated on the show before, I believe it's

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:21.340
an issue much bigger than just this one game and Yoshi P, but it is an issue and it holds me back

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:30.940
from being able to go, yay. Because even though I like to think because I'm an ally, I can't

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.540
celebrate unless we're all celebrating and we're not all going to be celebrating. So it's a bummer.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:42.380
Well, that's how I feel about folks playing Blizzard games.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:51.180
Well, and everybody also draws their lines in certain places. So that's how I feel about

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:58.220
certain social media websites, but it is what it is. SSJ went ahead and met with a very interesting

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:03.820
comment saying, doesn't the Saudi public investment fund own part of Square anyways? Not saying that

01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.140
they have a say in the matter, but just interesting to think about. Oh no, very interesting to think

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:14.940
about because we've heard about how Saudi investments more and more and more in certain

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:20.060
gaming companies and this whole, and there's a whole, I don't want to get too far down this

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:25.260
rabbit hole, but I have to just as somebody who is gay and I'm not going to apologize for it

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:31.180
on this particular program. Saudi Arabia has also been like, actually, wait, I don't want to

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:35.260
misstate this. I don't want to get this wrong. I think it might be another country.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:47.740
There's a country that criminalized LGBTQ in the media this week that then said,

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.060
oh, but we don't want to discourage gay people from coming here and visiting and spending their

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:56.060
tourist dollars. They don't have anything to worry about if they come out here.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:06.620
No, it wasn't Uganda, Rama. Maybe it was Qatar during the World Cup. I feel like it was Saudi

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.220
Arabia in the news this week. No, I think you're right. I think it was.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:15.340
Yeah. So I apologize profusely if I am misappropriating that comment, but

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:24.860
I'm not able to Google in the moment here. But I just remember seeing it cross my timeline and I

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:32.780
was like, if you don't treat us all with respect, you do not have the right to these dollars,

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:45.660
period. I think it goes for any factor that you feel strongly enough. And people will

01:10:46.860 --> 01:11:01.740
look in judgment at anyone who says they're an ally who does this. If you're an ally to

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:09.100
trans people, you won't put money in Harry Potter. If you're an ally to women, you won't put

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:20.700
your money into things that have hurt women. If you're an ally to having free human rights all

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.420
over the world, you won't visit places with those massive human rights violations.

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:34.300
Right. SSJ 100 Matt doing the research and finding out apparently Saudi Arabia owns 4.32%

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:39.100
of Square Enix. That is very interesting, actually. And part of this I hadn't considered

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:44.620
before, to be honest, that Saudi Arabia actually has a stake in Square Enix and now is suppressing

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:50.700
arguably one of Square Enix's biggest releases of the year in their own country. It's just wild to

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.180
me. That's how much they don't like gay stuff. It's just wild.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.020
I'm also posting in the chat, but for anyone who wants to look, if you look up

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:06.620
the Human Rights Watch website, they have a map of where there's anti-LGBT laws by country.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:15.340
And so I think everyone owes it to themselves and others to be educated on this and make ethical

01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:15.820
decisions.

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:21.980
All right, let's move on to something happier. A follow-up, actually, of something we talked

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:25.900
about a few weeks ago, because I remember we were making our own predictions about this story,

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:32.380
but now we know what, DarkSakura? Well, we know who is making it into the

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:41.260
video game hall of fame, and those are going to be Computer Space, Barbie Fashion Designer,

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:47.260
The Last of Us, and Wii Sports. I believe that I named three of those.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:52.540
I'm trying to go back and find the receipts if I save that document from that episode.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:13:01.180
I might have my notes from when I, no, I just have my classic game lists.

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:04.140
Yeah, I'd have to go back to that episode. I really should have saved those guesses.

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.780
I know I said Barbie, and I know I said Computer Space.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.820
Yeah. But at any rate,

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:23.260
these are all games that had absolute influence and notability for what they contributed to

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:29.580
video games in popular culture and in general.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:41.100
The first one, of course, being the first commercial video game that was

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:48.620
Computer Space. If you think about it, in 1970, there wasn't a video game market.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:55.580
This began it. Barbie Fashion Designer was the first one to target girls.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:05.900
Very gender role oriented, but still. And Last of Us, it stood out for being

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.620
more than a game. It being a full story experience.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:11.680
Yeah.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:19.740
And of course, Wii Sports was the one that gets everybody playing the game.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.060
Targeted at retirement homes. Just kidding.

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:29.580
I mean, but still, it could get children into gaming. It got the elderly into gaming.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:35.900
Because make no mistake, yes, it's physical activity, but it is also gamifying physical

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:40.620
activity, which can go a long way. I mean, that's sort of the approach I've been taking to

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:47.340
how I'm doing ballet. I set myself these levels to get, you know, it's gratifying to get a score

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:52.220
and it's gratifying to find yourself getting better at the game. It's the same thing.

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:58.700
And I honestly, well, brava. Those are some good selections.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:02.780
Yeah, they're good. I seem to remember on my personal list, I'm pretty sure I had Barbie and

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:07.420
Wii Sports, but I know for a fact, I did not put computer space on it. And I'm pretty sure

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:12.460
I didn't put Last of Us on it because I kind of felt like Last of Us, I felt was a little bit

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:17.660
more of the recency bias with the TV show and so forth. But I'm not mad about the pick whatsoever.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:22.140
Like I get it. I totally get it. You know, these are all strong picks. It's just, you know, the

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:26.700
short list, I believe had Wizardry on it. I think that was one of the ones that I had selected.

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:31.820
But still, it's a very decent, it's hard to be mad at this list for sure.

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:37.580
I'm double checking the other ones. Well, yeah, in computer space,

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.700
one of the important things about that is that their developers went on to establish Atari.

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:43.200
Yeah.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:49.100
Okay, there was also Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, FIFA,

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:54.380
GoldenEye 007, NBA 2K, Quake and Wizardry. I think I might have mentioned Quake.

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.860
Yeah, I feel like Quake was on my shortlist too, but yeah.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:07.260
But no, I totally agree with this list of winners for the reasons listed. They were all notable.

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:14.700
And I do actually completely agree with The Last of Us being on there, because I think it is one

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:21.980
of those few games that has pushed the border of entertainment, you know, between how much of this

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:27.100
is narrative and how much of this is game and the emotional investment involved. Because I

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:32.300
don't think I've talked to a single person who's played it that hasn't gotten somewhat emotional

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.420
over parts of the game.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:42.460
Yeah. And I get it. Again, I can't help but feel like the recent success of the HBO show

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:49.820
lent itself to that. And how much is that a reflection of the original game, especially

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:55.900
compared to some of these other older titles? But at the same time, sure. Obviously the fact

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:59.820
that the source material lent itself to be able to make something like that, I get it. I understand

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:04.700
why it's on the shortlist and why ultimately they picked it. Maybe I'm just being an old man saying,

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.020
but there's older games they should have played. I get it. There's got to be a contemporary title

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:14.700
or two to make everybody pay attention. It's so funny because this is the same week as the Rock

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:19.420
and Roll Hall of Fame, right? Because we've seen all those posts about Missy Elliott made the

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.580
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Because if you're not already aware, because they put in Dolly Parton

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:29.900
last year, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is really like the Music Hall of Fame. It's not just

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:37.420
rock music. It's all music basically. But anyway, I digress. All right. Let's move on to a game that

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:43.820
will this, will this end up in the Hall of Fame someday? I don't know. I don't know, Loki.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:56.380
It might, but like, yeah. You know, Dead Game, of course, Pokemon Go hit its lowest revenue in five

01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:00.780
years. But of course, you know, Niantic isn't confirming that to be the case. Of course,

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:08.220
why would they? So according to the market research tool App Magic, they have determined

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:15.900
that in the month of April, that the revenue was down to $34.7 million, which is the lowest monthly

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:24.060
game revenue since February 2018. But Niantic says nope, nope, nope. In fact, revenues up.

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:31.820
Um, I mean, cool. That's still making quite a bit of money. I would like to make

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:40.060
$30 million in a month. Deft in chat took the words right out of my mouth. Niantic responding

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:47.660
to this so fast and not to the community is hilarious and sad. I actually think I'll take

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.820
out the word hilarious and just say sad. I understand your usage of it completely

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:57.020
Deft, but I just want to focus on the negative here. There's a rare thing on this show. I love

01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:03.020
games and I try to be very positive about games. And I've been trying to be very positive about

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:10.780
this company too. This continues to piss me off and nothing exacerbates it more than this example.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:18.700
They responded to this story within a day. They still have not responded to the community. Fuck

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:27.020
off. It's so upsetting. Well, gotta please the shareholders, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Deft says,

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:30.220
believe me, I'm not laughing in a happy way either. No. And I get the way you meant it.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:36.060
Sometimes you have to laugh because you've expended every other emotion.

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:41.580
I guess it's sometimes why people laugh at funerals. It's how we process grief.

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:51.340
Anyway. Yeah, it's, I mean, obviously, like, I don't believe it. I don't believe that they were

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:57.100
up. I think that obviously it's starting to come around. But like, still, it's a lot of money that

01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:02.460
they're making. Like if one starts getting down to the single digit millions, and let's call it,

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:08.460
you know, that they're suffering. But right now, it's like, oh, no, they only made $34 million.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.660
I can tell you right now, it's not like they're breaking the bank. They didn't put $34 million

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:20.700
worth of development into the game during the month of April. So they're making plenty of money.

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:26.940
Like, it's just, I don't know. It's, it's so wild with Niantic. So Niantic's putting out a

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:30.700
new game this week. I don't know if y'all know, but that Peridot is finally releasing, at least

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:34.860
in the US. I don't know if it's a global release or just the US, but it's coming out this week. So

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:39.660
do with that info what you will. I will say this. I found out they're working on another

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:45.420
application and it's, I've been out for a little bit in testing. It's called Truffle. And it's the

01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:50.860
type of social media, social network they're working on. It's only in beta test in the Austin,

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:55.740
Texas area right now, because I believe they soft launched it with South by Southwest in Austin,

01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:01.020
Texas. But it's interesting because we remember the words about Niantic purchasing a social

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:05.900
network and what were they doing it for? And it appears it's this, and it's an interesting type of

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:14.140
your friends pointing out the cool places in town and the hotspots with these, this app. It sounds

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:20.300
interesting. Yeah. It almost sounds like a, a sort of an evolution of sorts of four square.

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:24.540
So I'm curious to get, I can't tell you cause I can't use it. It's only available in Austin right

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:29.020
now, but it's interesting to see how Niantic goes in all these other directions. And that's why I

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:35.420
feel like again, Niantic on some, on some principle, I don't think it's going to be hurt

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:42.220
by the shit they're pulling in Pokemon go and, and the potential revenue being lost, you know,

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:47.900
whether it's factor perceived or whatever it is at this point, because they have all these other

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.820
things going on that seem like they're really interesting and probably going to be positive,

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:57.740
but it's so weird to watch a company like literally leave money at the altar.

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:03.660
Or on the table, whatever you want to call it. They're literally leaving money at the table

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:08.780
by doing this. I it's, it's just, I've never seen anything like it in gaming.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:19.900
I mean, yeah, I don't know. They feel it's a, it's a, they feel that it's a gamble. I mean,

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:27.020
they just look at the numbers. We can, we can't see their backend data. So to them, you know,

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:34.860
yeah, it's, it's a balance between pissing off the fan base and pissing off the people that

01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:40.860
are paying for these in game purchases. If it doesn't upset the whales, then whatever.

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:47.820
I can't see in our chat right now says you could most likely chalk up most of the industry's

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:56.220
problems to shareholders and execs. Oh, this show turns 21 next, next month. If there's one lesson,

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:02.700
I want you to take from 21 years of orange lounge radio. It's that every, everything that's wrong in

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:09.500
this industry is shareholder isn't execs. Every bad decision ever made in gaming was made in a

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:15.420
boardroom. It wasn't made by an artist. It wasn't made by a level designer. It wasn't made by a QA

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:21.420
tester. It wasn't made by the hardworking people on the front lines. It wasn't made by it. Every

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:27.260
bad decision was made in a boardroom. If you could take anything from 21 years of this show,

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:38.220
take that. Enjoy. All right. Anyhow, moving on. I think we're over to, oh, me talking about

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:43.820
Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. Ah, yes. After all, I have been playing this series a little bit,

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:48.460
at least the first game. I kind of got sidetracked from playing the second game, thanks to Stranger

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:54.220
of Paradise. But at some point I'll get back to it. Anyway, the sales have been bragged about a

01:23:54.220 --> 01:24:00.540
little bit for the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. They have crossed 2 million units worldwide.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:06.540
That's right. Now that these have been released on more platforms, Square has announced that they

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:13.340
have sold over 2 million units worldwide. In a tweet, Final Fantasy wrote, we're delighted

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:17.740
to announce we've shipped and digitally sold over 2 million copies of the Final Fantasy

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:22.860
Pixel Remaster series across Steam, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and mobile. Thank you all

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:26.860
for joining us. If you haven't, now's the perfect time. Yes, yes. Put that in there. Of course,

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:33.900
now that doesn't say if it's 2 million from 6, if you bought all 6, does that count as 6 or does

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:41.260
that count as 1? Because I bet it counts as 6. But still, not bad numbers for something that was

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:47.980
probably a smaller team to make than something like Final Fantasy XVI or, you know,

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:53.260
Forespoken or some of Square Enix's other recent releases. So, I'm sure they're feeling pretty

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:58.220
good about this number. It's a bummer they couldn't put out more physical copies because

01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:04.780
there's a lot of people that still want those, can't get them. But anyway, I guess there are

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:10.620
other people leaving money on the table, who knew? But congrats on the sales. I hope it encourages

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:16.700
the remake of more retro. I hope we get something like this for more retro titles. Chrono Trigger.

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:25.900
Hello. It's Square. It's time. Square. Square Enix. It's time. Chrono Trigger. You've had

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:30.460
these Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters. You've had Chrono Cross. I realize that's probably not the

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:35.580
best example, but you fixed Chrono Cross a year later. You've done Live Alive. You've got that

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:45.660
Square. Chrono Trigger. It's time. Do it. Tactics 2, please. Thank you. All right, moving on.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:54.140
Dark Sakura. For a moment, I was making sure that I wasn't muted because I had been munching. But,

01:25:54.860 --> 01:26:02.620
you know, there's still that big news censorship issue going on in Russia, especially in regards to

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:12.140
their horrid acts against Ukraine. But a Finnish newspaper is doing something about it. The

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:17.180
newspaper is called, I am going to butcher this. That's not the name of it, by the way.

01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:27.020
Helsing and Sonomat, they were bypassing Russia's censorship using Counter-Strike.

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:37.180
So, basically, the thing is that while the news outlets are blocked, foreign media and whatnot,

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:53.260
online games are not banned. And Counter-Strike is really, really popular in Russia. So, you can

01:26:53.900 --> 01:27:02.540
make custom-made maps that anyone can download and use. And so, that is what this paper is pretty

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:07.820
much doing. In fact, they unveiled this on World Press Freedom Day, which was this past Wednesday.

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:16.060
They have a basement in one of the apartment buildings. And in a hidden room,

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:26.380
there are Russian-language reporting by newspaper war correspondents in Ukraine. So,

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:34.060
you can actually see what the true documentation is outside of Russia. And it's a digital room

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:40.540
lit up by red lights and plastered with news articles and pictures that report on the various

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:46.620
events going on. And on one of the walls, players can find a map of Ukraine that shows

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:52.460
where there are details on attacks on civilian populations and a Russian-language recording

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:59.980
of someone reading the articles allowed playing in the background. And basically,

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:08.140
these are escaping Russian propaganda. And then that map has been downloaded over 2,000

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:17.740
times though the paper can't track the downloads by geography. But even so, this is...

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:25.180
Actually, I'm gonna read this quote from one of the people behind this. This definitely underlines

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:29.980
the fact that every attempt to obstruct the flow of information and blind the eyes of the public

01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:43.580
is doomed to fail in today's world. And this is like the modern equivalent of the air raids that

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:51.100
would drop flyers on countries during World War II. It's an awfully clever way to get through

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:56.860
that firewall of information. I will say it's fascinating that it's in a video game too,

01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:02.140
but pretty cool for gaming because we don't always get associated with the good stories.

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:05.980
But this is super clever how they're doing this. The irony that it's in Counter-Strike,

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:13.580
which is an anti-terrorism TV team type of thing. And the fact that it's so popular,

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:23.020
I think that it has something like over 4 million players in Russia. If even a quarter of people

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:31.020
download this map on some kind of whim and then see all of this, they're gonna talk about it.

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:35.660
Of course, then we have the counter. How long is it gonna take the Russian government to start

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:43.100
noticing as well and shut this down? But at any rate, I'm glad the information is out there.

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:50.780
I'm glad that the truth is being known. They haven't shut down podcasts though,

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:55.900
because I don't want to shine a spotlight on anyone, but I know in our Discord,

01:29:55.900 --> 01:30:02.060
we have somebody over there that participates with this show and is aware of what's going on

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:11.100
over there. They're not plugging up all the holes. Well, no, I think that it's impossible to

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:17.980
you know, to plug up everything. And on top of that, I wouldn't even be surprised if there are

01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:29.340
maybe lower level politicians who don't really care for what their country is doing.

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:33.100
And they may have to tow a public line, but I wouldn't doubt that there are

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.620
sympathetic people who are letting the information come through.

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:43.740
Yeah. All right. Well, let's move on. We have some more stories. Let's go to this.

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:50.300
Timely with next month being the time when E3 would have happened, but you know.

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:58.620
Yes. So Xbox Game Showcase, which is going to be Sunday, June 11th at 10 a.m. Pacific time,

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:05.900
which they're going to have a Starfield Direct immediately following the Xbox Game Showcase.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:13.260
More of like, OK, listen, Starfield's not as broken as Redfall. Trust us. You know,

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:20.460
we still have time to. So, yeah, I'm curious to see what that's going to look like.

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:25.500
Obviously, the Xbox Game Showcase is going to show us more of what the Xbox studios are working on.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:30.140
So hopefully we'll see some more stuff out of that as well. And being that Starfield's got

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:40.700
its own direct. Maybe, you know, other things, so. Yeah, apparently also on June 13th,

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:47.340
they're going to be airing a Xbox Game Showcase extended and says it's a stream

01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:55.820
that will host some interviews based off of the game announcements. I'm excited.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:02.140
Yeah. What else from Microsoft Studios would you like to hear more about?

01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:10.620
Fable. Yeah, that's a new Fallout game or like not necessarily the Fallout, but like

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:17.820
whatever was it? Obsidian is working on. Oh, oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. I can't remember

01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:22.460
the name of the game. There's another game that they're working on. It's another medieval game.

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:26.540
Yeah, pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. They showed a preview for it at one point and I

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.180
totally can't remember what it was called now, but yes.

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:34.140
I would like to see that. I just like to see like it's more of the stuff that we don't know

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:40.060
is coming yet. Like, I think that's exciting. I'm still hopeful for Starfield. Like, I'm not,

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.300
it's Starfield's not something I'm like super excited about, but like, I'm going to check it

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:50.460
out. But like, it's I'm just like trying to see what, you know, stuff to anticipate, you know,

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:57.260
what new things are out there. I mean, you know, obviously for some other sports is cool. I mean,

01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:01.660
I'm more excited about whatever the next Horizon game is. That said, I still haven't played the

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:06.940
last Horizon game or maybe I did play the last Horizon game. I don't know. Probably still need

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:12.780
to play the last Horizon game because Horizon's awesome, but I'm more excited about the Horizon

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:20.060
series versus like the mainline sports series. But I mean, I don't know. Let's see what other

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:27.260
cool stuff they have coming. All right. I wanted to mention as show 100 Matt in chat says, needless

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:32.620
to say that Sunday show role will be written on the fly to accommodate that. As is typical that

01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:36.620
we've done in year past, usually what we do is we kind of block off the opening of the show to just

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:41.340
say, we're going to talk about whatever Microsoft unveiled this morning. So we've, we've done that

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:46.220
with the traditional E3 press conference schedule. If you go back a few years, usually we would say,

01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:50.540
first half of the show, we're going to talk about Microsoft and Sony. Second half of the show,

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.580
we're talking about Nintendo. So, you know, we'll do something like that with whatever

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:58.780
additional press conferences we may get or information dumps that week. So yes,

01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:02.460
sometimes we have to be a little bit flexible on the fly because we have no idea what they will say

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:06.140
because there might be something that blows us away. You never know. Something that didn't

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:10.620
make the show world tonight, but there are continued, it wasn't our discord.

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:15.180
Now I'll urge you all to go over to our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:20.940
But earlier today, there's more rumors going around about Sony's continued partnership with

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:26.460
Konami. And we know that the Silent Hill 2 remake is something that's exclusive to PlayStation 5.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:33.980
Apparently those rumors are ramping up that there's also going to be a Metal Gear Solid 3,

01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:38.220
for some reason, remake. It seems odd to me they're going straight for 3 and not doing the

01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:43.260
trilogy, but that's what happens with these rumors sometimes is they're weird. That's happening. And

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:48.460
then something new in the Castlevania universe is rumored that's going to be a Sony exclusive,

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:54.300
a reimagining of Castlevania. Again, take it all with a grain of salt. But the reason why I say

01:34:54.300 --> 01:35:00.460
all that is that that could be huge news if a Castlevania game comes out of nowhere. I'm sorry,

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:06.060
but that's bigger than almost anything to me because I love that series. I'd be so excited

01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:12.620
if that happens. Assuming it's not looking like the Xbox 360 games and a little more maybe like

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:24.060
the PlayStation Saturn games. All right. If I'm looking for a new game to play, the Xbox app on

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:30.300
PC, because that's the thing is you run apps on your PC now, especially Windows 11, you can find

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.900
games based on accessibility features now. So you can actually go in and look for games on Game Pass

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:44.540
based on accessibility types of features. Also, so mean like narrated game menus, a steady camera,

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:50.540
volume controls. Those are some examples of things you can sort for in the Xbox app. Also, you could

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:56.060
also sort on the how long to beat. So this was already in there because I know you look at some

01:35:56.060 --> 01:36:00.060
games and they'll show you like the estimation on how long is it to beat and how long is it to fully

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:09.660
complete. And you can actually sort on these as well. As an example, Mass Effect 3 says it takes

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:15.180
24 and a half hours to beat the main story, but 50 total hours if you want to do everything,

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:18.940
including side quests, which sounds about right. That's about how long it took me and I did

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:24.300
everything including side quests. So, but that is neat that you can sort for that as well,

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:29.820
especially the accessibility features. Very cool for folks that are looking for something new to

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:35.580
maybe can't keep track of, oh, this game has this, this game has that, and that stuff.

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:42.140
All right, let's take time now to take a step back in time with this segment.

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:58.460
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:03.340
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:11.260
But it's not just a game because once a month, it's a non-video game. What did you pick for us

01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:14.380
this month, DarkSakura? I picked Operation.

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:24.300
Good pick. Because it's got some electronics in it. Yeah, some electronics. Very shocking little

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:37.180
game. Anyway, Operation is a game that originally came out March 27th, 1965 and went through very

01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:47.500
few aesthetic changes until I'd say more recently. But it is a, it runs on batteries and it is a game

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:53.420
of physical skill that tests your hand, eye coordination, and fine motor skills.

01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:59.820
It was developed, actually, the prototype was invented in 1964 by the University of Illinois'

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:07.020
industrial design student, John Spinello, and then he sold the rights to a toy designer named

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:16.780
Marvin Glass for $500 and the promise of the job. He never got the job. But it was produced by

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:23.900
Milton Bradley in 1965 and is currently produced by Hasbro and the franchise is worth about

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:33.660
$40 million. It is a variant of an older, older game that was popular at fairs. It involved an

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:40.940
electrified wire loop. But this one is an operating table. It's lithographed with this

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:51.340
lightness of a patient who's nicknamed Cavity Sam and has a large red light bulb for the nose and

01:38:52.300 --> 01:39:00.540
no junk. And on the surface are different openings that are labeled with the names and functions for

01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:06.940
different ailments that have plastic pieces in there. And then in general, you have to use

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:13.260
tweezers to remove these objects without touching the edge of the cavity opening.

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:23.260
So at any rate, and also one thing I think is absolutely hilarious at the Kaiser doctor's office,

01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:29.260
not far from me, there's a giant painting of an operation table in the lobby and I think that's

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:35.660
fantastic. I'll take a picture of it next time I'm there. But anyway, you have two sets of cards

01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:42.140
on the game and there's a specialist card that you get at the start of the game and extra cards

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:46.700
are removed from play. The doctor cards are shuffled to make a deck and are placed face down.

01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:56.220
The American and Australian versions, you take turns taking a doctor card and the top doctor card

01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:03.820
and then offering a cash payment for removing the object. So the player in control uses a pair of

01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:09.660
tweezers that are also referred to as electro probes connected to the board by a wire to remove

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:15.500
the piece without touching the metal edges of the cavity. So if you remove it, then you turn the card

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:21.740
over and the value is what you're paid. A failure will allow you to use your specialist card for

01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:28.300
that ailment to remove it for double value. And then if you lose your specialist card or if no

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:33.580
one is holding it, the doctor card is returned to the bottom of the deck. And then the cards

01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:43.340
are both types removed from play as soon as the pieces are retrieved. If you draw a

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:50.060
certain doctor card while holding its corresponding specialist card, then you can deliberately fail

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:57.100
the first one and then use the second one for that double value. But the winner is the player

01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:05.340
that has the most money after all the pieces have been removed. And it is definitely a challenging

01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:14.940
game because these little holes in there are kind of deep. The wishbone to me was probably

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:24.220
one of the harder pieces. The Adam's apple being that it's round is also a fairly difficult one.

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:33.900
I always found the butterflies easy and the rubber band. The charlie horse was also hard.

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:39.260
I thought the rubber band was a monster. Oh, no, thank you. I just have to read this comment.

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:44.860
This is so funny. Bonz006 says, so this game was undercover black market organ harvesting.

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:46.240
Yeah.

01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:58.220
Pretty much. But at any rate, the pieces are as follows. There's the Adam's apple,

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:04.300
which is an apple in the throat. And that's $100. There's a broken heart. There's a heart with a

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:11.260
crack on it. That's also $100. The wrenched ankle, which is a wrench in the ankle for $100.

01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:18.300
Butterflies in the stomach, which is a butterfly in the stomach, $100. Spare rib, which is two ribs

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:24.700
fused together as one piece for $150. Water on the knee, which is a pail, a little plastic pail

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:33.020
for $150. The funny bone is a cartoonish bone for $200. A charlie horse is a small horse that

01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:39.820
rests near the hip joint. I always think of charlie horses as being in the ankle, but never mind.

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:45.900
Ryder's cramp, which is a pencil in the forearm for $200. The ankle bone connected to the knee

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:50.700
bone. That's the rubber band that is stretched between the two pegs. It is the only non-plastic

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:58.780
piece and the challenge where you have to insert it rather than remove it. And it comes from the

01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:07.100
song Dem Bones. Anyway, the wishbone, like the chicken wishbone located in the chest for $300.

01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:14.940
Brain freeze, which is an ice cream cone in the brain for $600. That was added in 2004 when

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:21.660
Milton Bradley had fans vote on a new piece. And the promotion was called What's Ailing Sam?

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:29.100
And the top prize was a $5,000 shopping spree. The other contenders were tennis elbow and growling

01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:34.300
stomach. And then of course the last piece is the bread basket, which is a slice of bread.

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:44.300
It's a very small notch. The notch is removed to make you able to grab it, but it's a

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:50.460
it's a thousand. I honestly, I never thought that one was super hard. It seems to me like some of

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:57.660
the quote easier ones were some of the harder ones. As far as other variations, the very first

01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:06.540
variation of this by Hasbro came out in 2009. It was an update called Operation Sound Effects.

01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:12.220
It was the only one to remove the buzzer and cards in place of the speaker. And so the game

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:18.300
could announce the pieces to be removed by the player using an audio cue such as twang for the

01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:25.020
rubber band and a busy tone for the cell phone. There's a cell phone? But you had to press Sam's

01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:30.060
nose after removing the piece. And when all the pieces had been removed and Sam's nose is pressed,

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:35.340
the game plays a victory song. It also will allow you to do standard operation

01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:40.780
by sliding the power button to a lightning bolt. There are licensed versions out there,

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:47.340
including a few Spider-Man ones. There's a Fallout version where you operate on Vault Boy.

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:57.580
And the rads alarm is Sam's nose buzzer. In 2020, there was one called Operation Pet Scan,

01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:04.060
where you removed objects from a dog's digestive tract. The Dutch version is called Dr. Bibor,

01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:11.020
which is translated to Dr. Shakey. That's a better name for the game.

01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:21.180
I like that it was included, Dr. Bibor. Plus, I found a rad video in the YouTube-related clips

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:25.900
that say SpongeBob SquarePants Operation Game. Oh, is that legit?

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:32.620
Yeah, I think so, yeah. The funny thing about Operation, this is a great pick, by the way,

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:39.020
Darzaga, and I actually have a recent story about this too, which is wild, is that I went on the

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:49.500
Star Trek cruise a few weeks ago, really, a couple months ago, and they actually did a live on-stage

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:55.660
game of Operation during the variety show. They had a giant oversized operation board,

01:45:55.660 --> 01:46:00.060
and they had the doctor, because Robert Picardo was there, they had the doctor

01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:04.060
go against somebody else that was in the audience. And of course, the person in the audience won.

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:10.940
But it cracked me up because it's so obvious. The entertainment company that does the Star

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:15.340
Trek cruise is infamous. The very next week, they do a cruise called the 80s cruise,

01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:21.500
and they get a bunch of old 80s bands and the 80s MTV VJs, like Martha Quinn and stuff, go on the

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:27.420
cruise. It's that. It's very obvious that they had an operation thing on the ship for 80s week,

01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:33.580
and they were like, how could we use this for Star Trek week? Oh, we'll get the doctor to play.

01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:39.980
You know, I'm also looking at Hasbro's website, and in addition to the PET scan,

01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:45.900
there's an Operation X-Ray matchup, and there is Operation Junior.

01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.700
Zenmonkey11 talking about SpongeBob in chat says he doesn't have organs or bones.

01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:59.100
Don't put logic into Milton Bradley's Operation game.

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.820
How dare you put logic in the fantasy?

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:02.860
You will not go far.

01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.020
It does not belong here.

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:11.900
DJ Rama S is asking about the 80s cruise, Kurt Loder. Kurt Loder is more of a 90s icon,

01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:19.980
and believe it or not, Kurt Loder is more like 90s. I associate him with the news that,

01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:24.380
I know this is terrible, but it is what it is. I associate him with the news that Kurt Cobain

01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:29.340
passed away, because remember that was the big thing. It broke, you know, and it's Kurt Loder.

01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:35.340
Kurt Loder is like in his late 70s. Not saying that it's too old to cruise, but that man is a

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:41.500
lot older than you think, because he was kind of older on MTV for the average. I mean, the sad part

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:45.580
is he was probably our age when he was on MTV, but that was older than most of the people you

01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:51.340
saw on MTV at the time. So Kurt Loder's a little older. Oh, thank you. Rama says he's 78. So Kurt

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:57.180
Loder's a little older. Probably even this, I would say those 80s, like Martha Quinn's

01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:04.860
gotta be maybe what, like late or early 60s, late 60s maybe. So, you know.

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:05.820
I love Martha Quinn.

01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:13.260
Yeah. Anyway, ZenMonkey11 says, I miss 90s and early 2000s MTV. Don't we all? Don't we all miss

01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:18.780
that era when MTV actually played music videos? But the reality is, now we just see music videos

01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:25.500
whenever we want on YouTube. So it's interesting. Anyway. All right. Thank you for taking us down

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:33.260
memory lane with the non-video game of the month operation. All right. Let's do some other news

01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:38.540
around the gaming industry in a segment we call Rapid Fire News. Loki, you want to start us off?

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:46.780
Yeah. So we have a cool indie game being made, or I should say like, it's not like a deep,

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:55.180
sort of a de-make, but probably an improvement. It is a custom Zelda Game Boy game based off of

01:48:55.180 --> 01:49:05.580
one of the CDI Zelda games. So they've taken that now, the story of that and created a top-down RPG

01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.180
in the style of a Game Boy. I covered that last week.

01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:16.380
Oh, you did? Okay. Yeah. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't done it already.

01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:22.940
Um, and then we may have some more casting news regarding the new moral combat movie that's

01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:28.780
supposed to be coming out, the new sequel. Um, the rumor is that apparently Carl Urban will be

01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:32.220
playing Johnny Cage. What?

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:39.580
It, yeah, I have a hard time picturing that. Like honestly, shaved Carl Urban maybe,

01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:43.420
like just like right now in the boys Carl Urban. I don't really see it.

01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:48.220
Somebody in Discord, it may have been Tiger Claw. Sorry if I'm misappropriating this comment,

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.860
but I believe suggested it could be an older, burnt out Johnny Cage, like an older take on

01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:57.500
the character. And considering in the later Mortal Kombat games, Johnny Cage has a kid,

01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:03.260
right? Cassie Cage. It may make sense to go that route. Could be interesting.

01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:04.060
That makes sense. Yeah.

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:11.260
Multiple people in chat suggesting Carl Urban for Kano, but I believe Kano was in the last movie,

01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:21.660
right? You know, though, I honestly, my, my ultimate Carl Urban is as Judge Dredd.

01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:26.540
What has he been in lately? I just, I don't know anything outside of Star Trek.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:30.620
That show. Okay. It's awesome. Got it.

01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:37.420
Yeah. Tiger Claw says it here in chat. Thank you. Says I could see a Johnny Cage as an

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:43.420
aging actor who hasn't had a hit movie for some time. Yeah. It's, it's, it could be that take on

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:49.260
Johnny Cage. It's not the, the modern, younger take. And if they want to put in characters like

01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:55.740
Cassie Cage and Jackie Briggs, they, they may do some, some aging, a little bit of the characters.

01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:58.300
I love Cassie and Jackie and they need to be there.

01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:02.220
Yeah. I, I would, I would like to see the more modern characters involved too.

01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:05.580
The new Mortal Kombat movie wasn't bad. It was okay.

01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:09.980
I never did see it. I'm lame. I still haven't seen the Mario Brothers movie.

01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:17.500
I know you need to see D and D. See the Dungeons and Dragons movie. If you're going to go see a

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.940
movie, go see Dungeons and Dragons. I still need to see Guardians of Galaxy 3 that just came out

01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:25.980
this week. But like, can I even see D and D anymore in theaters? Yeah, I think so. I mean,

01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:31.740
I figured. Let's go. Wait, see Mario or D and D? Both. But are we going to theater hop?

01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:35.180
No, we can do D and D. Like, like we're 17.

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:40.780
I think if you choose the two, between the two, I think you'll have more fun seeing D and D. Like,

01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:43.500
honestly. I do want to see them both. I like Mario, but like.

01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:51.180
I can't see since D and D's on Netflix. It's on digital now. Yeah. That's how fast,

01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:54.940
yeah. That's how fast the movies are. Scream 6 is on Paramount Plus already.

01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:57.820
That was just out in theaters like six months ago.

01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:59.900
Oh, well then there you go. Watch it on Netflix.

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:03.740
I guess so, but I want to watch it again. I can still come to Dark Sakura's house and eat

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:07.980
popcorns. Yes, I have two courses of popping. Okay.

01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:15.500
All right. Well, I think it's on like, yeah, because I don't know if it's on demand in the

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:21.580
sense that you can rent it like on demand. It's not like included with your subscription on demand

01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:27.420
yet. It's probably still in theaters. I think Mario was dated for the first week of June.

01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:30.860
I want to say I saw an early date for digital that was the first week of June.

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:38.300
But yeah, the days of like six months between theaters and those days are gone.

01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:45.340
It's mere weeks now. It's pretty wild, but I kind of like it to be honest. Like,

01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:50.460
and plus for those people, you know, not everybody is still comfortable going to a movie theater,

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:54.780
masked or not. Not everybody's still comfortable with that. So it, you know, for those folks,

01:52:55.420 --> 01:53:01.500
they don't have to wait that long. It's not too bad. So. All right. Oh, Def says Mario was

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:05.580
supposed to be on demand this week. Are you kidding me? Well, if I just sit around Twitter

01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:10.060
long enough, apparently I'll get a copy from Argentina. Like I thought there was news though

01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:16.380
that got delayed because it was doing so well. So they don't want to immediately like cut into their

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:23.420
sales. I think they got pushed back. Zen Monkey 11 in chat says I watch it on VR on a big screen

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:28.140
like I'm in a movie theater. Then I eat Jelly Belly popcorn flavor. It's close to the real

01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:35.180
thing. Dude. I used to love those Jelly Belly popcorn jelly beans. Now I don't eat them anymore

01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:42.220
because LOL diabetes, but they were good. They were really good. Anyway.

01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:47.420
Those are the only kind of jelly beans I can eat because of allergies, but I feel bad about eating

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:52.220
them now because of who they supported. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of Jelly Belly

01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:57.100
at all, to be honest. But before all that happened, when I was eating them more, it was

01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:04.300
that and toasted marshmallows by far my favorite flavor, just to be clear. All right. Moving on,

01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:11.020
I think Dark Soccer, you have a rapid fire story. I do. Street Fighter 6 comics.

01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:17.900
There was something that came out for free comic book day. Of course, the art is being done by

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:24.620
Udon, which has done many, many of the releases for the Street Fighter comics over the years.

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:36.460
But the Street Fighter 6 number zero was out. It had behind it, you know, folks from Capcom,

01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:45.340
Genzo Man, Edwin Huang, and Matt Moylan. The first issue, though, did get pushed back and will

01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:53.820
release on May 24th with other issues coming afterwards. So it is a lead in that follows Ken

01:54:54.540 --> 01:55:02.460
as he is invited to a mysterious tournament that then endangers his family. And that's why

01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:13.900
he apparently is parading around as a displaced person. So in the game. But yeah. But I mean,

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:18.380
and also, you know, for other goodies about it, there's going to be, you know,

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:25.020
a steelbook case and there's new music tracks coming out. And still more talks about a movie.

01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:32.940
Good times. I can't wait for Street Fighter 6. I hope it doesn't get lost amongst the other games

01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:38.140
for me. I like the demo. I did try the demo, by the way. I loved how you just fight random people

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:46.540
on the street. It was pretty cool. All right. Yeah. I love the time I played it. It was so

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:52.460
much fun. Shane showed up in chat and says I said something wrong. Did I say it was six months ago

01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:57.260
that Scream 6 was in theaters? I meant to say weeks, six weeks ago, that these movies are

01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:01.820
turning around fast. He says I said months, but sometimes I feel like he's gaslighting me. All

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:09.180
right. Anyway, let's talk about Xbox Game Pass and some new additions coming to Xbox Game Pass in

01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:13.580
early May, which of course we all know Red Fall. We talked about that, but what else do you have

01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:18.620
to look forward to on Game Pass? Ravenlock just came out on the 4th and coming out tomorrow is

01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:25.580
Weird West Definitive Edition on series X and S. Also Shadowrun Trilogy coming out for PC.

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:31.420
This is, it's already on cloud and console, but now it will be on PC. So that is, if you're

01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:35.660
thinking I've already played that on Game Pass, it's now going to be on PC. These are the tactical

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:45.340
RPG Shadowrun games now on PC. Fuga Melodies of Steel 2 will also be out. This is a day

01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:51.660
one release and it's a sequel to the first Fuga Melodies of Steel. Some other games that recently

01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:57.740
released on Game Pass, Besiege, Quantum Break returned if you weren't already aware, and then

01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:06.460
some download games you can get. LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga now has Luke Starkiller in it.

01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:13.020
I don't know if that's something you get free. Is it Luke? Like clone Luke from the books?

01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:16.940
Oh, it is the early concept design of Luke Skywalker.

01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:22.060
Oh yeah. Cause that was his name during the Blue Harvest days.

01:57:23.020 --> 01:57:26.780
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:32.540
some games that you'll be playing a little sooner than Starfield. Loki.

01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:40.460
Yes. Darkest Dungeon 2 out on PC this week. Dookapon Kingdom Connect on Nintendo Switch.

01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:47.260
Fuga Melodies of Steel 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:53.980
and Xbox Series. Marvel's Midnight Suns on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And last but not least,

01:57:54.780 --> 01:58:00.140
Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom Better Not Pirate Edition on Nintendo Switch.

01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:05.340
I'm pretty sure that's the DLC for Midnight Suns because the Bloodstorm pack is coming out

01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:16.620
as a download character. I think that maybe it, well, no, it's the actual game because it

01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:23.420
launched on next gen and stuff. Now it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. But yes, also the

01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:30.300
DLC is coming out for the Switch. The DLC is coming out and then they said something about

01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:35.660
the Switch version being canceled. What? Oh, it's such a good game and people just weren't

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:41.340
giving it enough of a chance. I'm looking forward to the future Vampire Storm coming in.

01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:46.860
Yeah. No Switch version for Marvel's Midnight Suns, which I think was shown at a Nintendo

01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:54.380
Direct. Bravo. All right. Well, let's move on and check out what's coming out in Japan. We're

01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:59.500
coming off of Golden Week. So what are the big releases this week? Well, on the Nintendo Switch,

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:04.540
nobody wants to go up against The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom because pretty much that is

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:11.100
the release. But like regular edition, collector's edition, there's an amiibo coming out for it.

01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:19.340
There's third party covers, ear pod collections, a new front cover, a pouch, a hard case. You name

01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:24.300
it, you can get it for Tears of the Kingdom and Zelda. Because as I was referencing earlier in

01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:29.420
the show, we talked about it at the top of the show, this is the game that some people drop

01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:36.940
everything for. So this is that game's moment. As far as any game willing to release against

01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:42.060
this game in Japan, no, nothing on the Switch. Let me check the PlayStation 5 real quick.

01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:49.180
No, there's nothing on the PlayStation 5 either. Nobody's willing to touch Zelda this week.

01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:53.900
That's it. What about the PS4 if I go back that far? Sorry. I'm just like,

01:59:53.900 --> 02:00:03.100
really? Nobody's releasing anything. No, not even on PS4. Zelda and that's it in Japan. Dark

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:11.340
Soccer. You're gonna like it. That's right. On May 11 for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch, we have

02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:22.140
TT Isle of Man Ride on the Edge 3. We have on the 12th on Switch Legend of Zelda Tears of the

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:29.500
Kingdom. And that's it. That is fucking it. Sounds like a lot of stores are gonna make

02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:32.700
their money off of Zelda this week and there really doesn't need to be anything else coming

02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:40.460
out this week. I'm waiting for Puzzle Bobble. I'm just saying. No. Ooh, she's different. Okay.

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:47.660
I love this baseball's reference there, Dark Knight. Zelda the flamethrower,

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:54.220
merchandising. All right, moving on. We have some more headlines for you and then we'll get to your

02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:57.420
calls and your emails. I think we actually have a couple emails tonight, so we'll get to those

02:00:57.420 --> 02:01:04.540
and we'll get to your calls over on Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. But first, Loki.

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:11.340
Yes, and a new episode of What Year Is This? We have a brand new Double Dragon game coming out.

02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:18.700
What year is this? Double Dragon Gaiden Rise of the Dragons. It is a brand new game

02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:28.140
that I guess is a sequel to, or maybe a side story of, developed by Motus Games and it includes,

02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:33.340
they have like some roguelite elements to it. There's four different missions you can choose

02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:39.260
from that have randomized stage lanes. I'm sorry, hold up, hold up, rewind, backtrack.

02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:46.140
You said roguelike in a Double Dragon game? Yes, they have some of that, but then there's also,

02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:54.220
there's 13 playable characters. There's a two player co-op mode. They have even a tag team

02:01:54.780 --> 02:02:00.380
like ability so you play as two characters at once type of thing. It looks interesting. It's

02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:07.420
coming out on PC, Xbox consoles, PlayStation 4 and 5 and Switch. Don't get me wrong. I love me

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:16.060
a roguelike. I love a Dead Cells. I love a roguelike. Does everything need it? I guess so.

02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:19.180
Okay, let's put it this way. I don't think it's necessarily like

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:25.580
roguelike in the sense that you play through different levels that are somewhat randomized

02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:34.460
and you have money to unlock upgrades. It's as much roguelike as Ivan Iron Man Stewart's

02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:41.180
super off-road. Okay, that game was fucking awesome. If you had called it an Iron Man,

02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:46.620
Ivan Stewart super off-roading type of game, then I would have been no questions. 10 out of 10,

02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:50.700
no notes. No, I'm just saying it's like they have purchasable upgrades or something like that.

02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:57.180
Okay, well that's all right then. So that's the thing. Yeah, it looks cool. It's all done like

02:02:58.060 --> 02:03:05.020
a retro pixel style type thing. I mean, it looks good. So, I'll check it out.

02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:07.340
I have to, okay, hold on.

02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:14.300
I have to look at this because even I'm thinking, like, Dark Tetsuya in chat says,

02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:19.820
oh yeah, I want a new super off-road. And I'm like, fuck yeah. That's the fucking game I want.

02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:24.460
So the first thing I had to look up was, is Ivan Stewart dead? Because I have no idea,

02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:28.860
to be quite honest. I'm like, maybe there's a reason we have no more Iron Man Stewart.

02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:35.660
I have good news, everyone. Ivan Stewart is 77 years old and is still with us on this earth. So

02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:41.100
there could be another Ivan Iron Man Stewart super off-road game. And why we're not getting one,

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:44.380
I don't understand. Because he's sick of that shit.

02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:51.340
You know what? And they're still making Madden games even after Madden has left this earth. So

02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:56.300
I just, I don't understand. I don't understand why some sports series go on and on and on.

02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:59.500
This is this game that never ends. It just goes on and on.

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:04.140
You know Madden fake, he's on somewhere with Elvis on their home planet.

02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:09.580
But I'm literally sitting here going, this is a sports game I want every year and I will buy

02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:12.300
money every year. Crickets.

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:20.060
Well, I mean, for that you have dirt. I mean, it's rally racing. It's not exactly the same thing,

02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:22.140
but I don't know. It's not the same thing.

02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:26.780
They had like a, well, they had an off-road Thunder, which is pretty fun. That was a

02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:34.940
racing game. It's not the same, but you know, I would take another arcade game.

02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:39.340
I bet if I fucking go to a round table pizza, some of them still have a fucking off-road cabinet.

02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:47.740
Yep. That hasn't been cleaned underneath since 1993.

02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:53.900
The monitor is like as dark as you remember the lights being in the, in the pizza place,

02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:57.820
but nope. It's just the monitor that's burnt out because it's from the eighties, you know?

02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:06.620
Oh my God. You know, there's, there's kids today listening to this program that have no idea

02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:11.260
what Ivan Ironman Stewart, who, first of all, you don't know who Ivan Ironman Stewart is.

02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:16.060
And second of all, you've never played his game. And that's, that's just a goddamn shame.

02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:17.420
Let's just make it clear.

02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:19.820
I had to explain to someone who Evel Knievel was.

02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:24.460
Are you kidding me? SSG100Matt says he has 140 followers on his Twitter.

02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:29.580
Rob has more followers than him. Are you, are you sure it's him or is this somebody else?

02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:30.540
Like, is there photos?

02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:32.620
Can't be certain anymore.

02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:37.100
I know he can't be certain anymore. What's the at? Drop the at.

02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:42.460
Hold on. This is important.

02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:46.940
Nope. Yeah. Well.

02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:50.060
Okay. Twitter slash Ironman Stewart.

02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:58.300
Oh, wow. There's like videos and stuff. Are you kidding me? He has 160 followers?

02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:00.060
Are you-

02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:00.860
Following him.

02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:06.780
I'm following him too. This, this, this is y'all go, go follow Ironman Stewart.

02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:15.820
This is an official shout out. I don't understand that his likeness brought us the greatest

02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:20.380
pizza arcade video game ever made. And y'all get to give him 160 followers.

02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:24.380
This is what's wrong with gamers today. Get off my lawn.

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:28.780
Posting. Why isn't any, why aren't you guys following this guy?

02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:34.300
Seriously? I want to know. All right. Oh yeah.

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:39.180
Oh no, please. Oh no. S. Jonah and Matt is checking for any questionable RTs. Oh,

02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:45.340
please don't. Oh no. Oh no. I can't. I can't have him having retweeted. You know who from,

02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:47.340
Oh God, please, please.

02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.780
It doesn't appear. I don't-

02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:52.380
Please do not have participated in cancelable behavior.

02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:55.740
I have an Ironman Stewart. Please let me have this. Let me have

02:06:57.180 --> 02:07:00.780
this vanilla latte fantasy, please. All right.

02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:01.980
I'm sitting in the big chair.

02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:03.360
All right.

02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:07.340
And owls. He has an owl camera.

02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:15.020
No, S. Jonah and Matt, legit a concern. I understand. I understand. I get it.

02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:20.140
I mean, I don't see anything.

02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:23.260
Okay, good. Let's just stop there. Stop digging.

02:07:25.340 --> 02:07:29.420
Everybody stop. We agree if there's been no tweets in the past two years,

02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.140
then everything else is figureoutable.

02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:32.940
People change.

02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:39.420
People change. People change. People grow. All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:43.260
I can't move on from that. We have to worship the legend.

02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:44.060
Right?

02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:55.180
Hold on. Okay. At any rate, we have more sad closures going on. Sony shut down

02:07:56.060 --> 02:08:00.460
the concrete genie studio Pixel Opus.

02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:06.060
They put the announce that it was going to be closing down.

02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:14.700
They are- Hold on. I'm trying to- Yeah. They were launched in 2014,

02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:16.620
and their first game was Entwined.

02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:23.260
And then they put out the announcement that the game was available same day.

02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:32.380
And then they put out Concrete Genie, and that was nominated for two BAFTA Game Awards.

02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:36.300
And then they were going to be working on something in collaboration with

02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:42.220
Sony Pictures Animation, but now it's down. It's gone.

02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:49.100
I remember when- That was the year I was at the PlayStation conference on the ground floor.

02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:52.380
It was the year they announced Entwined. It was like the first announcement of the night.

02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:54.140
And it was like, it's out today.

02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.420
And they dropped it right there.

02:08:55.420 --> 02:09:02.060
Yeah. I played it when I got home. It was decent. I think it was a $10 game, if I remember right.

02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:09.100
It wasn't a premium title, but for a $10 game, it was fine. But that's a bummer.

02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:19.660
Yeah. It makes me so angry when the little studios are consumed, or at least they're

02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:25.260
you know, conceived. And then all of a sudden, nope, we don't think you're viable anymore,

02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.860
even though you do really good things and have a lot of good potential.

02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:34.140
It's just disgusting. It's all money.

02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:43.180
SSJ100Matt, who's on the investigation assignment of Ivan Ironman Stewart for

02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:47.980
Cancelable Behavior says, confirmed he's just a cute old man that watches

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:54.060
owls and cuddles with his dog. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for letting us have this.

02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:00.460
Perfect. Perfect. We love retired life of having owls and cuddling your dog. Perfect.

02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:01.820
Sounds like a dream. Perfect.

02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:03.660
Barn owls.

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:05.040
Right.

02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:13.100
Like he even has like camera shot, like the hutch camera where you can see the eggs and everything.

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:15.180
It's so cute. I love him.

02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:18.540
Darth Tetsuya said, I had to refresh and now y'all are following him now.

02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:24.060
LOL. Yes, we've we've gotten him up to 165 followers just in the short time we've been

02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:29.900
doing this show tonight. I'm just saying the greatest pizza parlor game of all time,

02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:35.500
his likeness and every pizza parlor in America and y'all gonna disrespect him with 160 followers.

02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:42.140
How many followers does Perez Hilton have? Just out of curiosity.

02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.340
Who cares?

02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:48.380
That's my point. All right. Anyway, moving on.

02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:54.220
Loki, I think I have to say that there's been some drama going on in the Dead by Daylight community

02:10:54.220 --> 02:11:04.700
around our skull merchant Twitter. And yeah, there's there's a certain streamer has been

02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:11.740
going very transphobic against this person. And honestly, I had forgotten that they existed

02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:17.420
and that they followed them until the drama came to light yesterday. I'll tell you about it later.

02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:22.700
But it's just like, sort of that thing that I think that we remember people in the background,

02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:28.060
and then we sort of stopped thinking about them, you know, and I think retirement might have

02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:33.100
removed some relevancy. So I mean, that could be a very big reason why there's less of a following

02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:39.260
now that and is likely fan base from, you know, racing, you know, or offroading.

02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:45.900
Probably your pre internet people. I'm just thinking about it. I'm trying to think

02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:53.020
logically why. No, yeah, I get it. All right. Let's move on. Loki have more unfortunate news

02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:55.580
in a similar vein of what dark soccer just talked about. Yeah.

02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:03.900
Yeah, so unity is laying off 8% of its global workforce or approximately 600 employees.

02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:12.620
Previously, they laid off about 225 people about a year ago, and another 284 at the start of this

02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:19.740
year. So it says, you know, unfortunately, they haven't, they haven't decided to comment on the

02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:27.660
issue. And apparently, in a recent interview, John Riccitello said that it's all about setting

02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:39.660
ourselves up for higher growth. It's very clear we had too many layers. And I guess, well, he's

02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:45.660
talking about like laying off would affect mill management, because they had too many managers or

02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:51.980
something like that. Yeah, but not with like 600 people, you know, 600 managers, so I don't know.

02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:55.100
All right.

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:59.260
Both the managers and the people that reported to them. Let's do the whole thing.

02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:02.700
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why exactly they were,

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:06.860
you know, what it was. And so you're not commenting on it. But lay off suck.

02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:11.900
You know, there was a comment in Discord again, I apologize. I don't have it up in front of me.

02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:18.700
But somebody had said that could kind of referencing, I think I'm putting a lot of words,

02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:21.980
I'm stretching this comment, but basically suggesting, does this mean we're going to be

02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:27.180
down to just one game engine, every game is going to be made in one game engine? Because if Unity

02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:32.940
were no, no, I don't think unity. No, there's like tons of stuff. There's open source game engines

02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:38.140
out there. Godot is one that you know, a lot of people use for different things. There's like

02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:43.260
GameMaker stuff, there's, you know, running your own engine on Unreal. I mean, there's lots of

02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:49.500
stuff that's out there. It's just, you know, a lot of these different things could be focused on like,

02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:53.500
maybe they're not making enough money in certain areas that they wanted to like, for example,

02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:58.540
mobile ads, like there's infrastructure that they're building it for certain stuff,

02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:03.180
or maybe they're focusing on different areas that they're not necessarily going to focus on anymore.

02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:07.180
I mean, I don't know, I've been solely far removed out of unity for a while that like,

02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:12.140
I don't really know what's going on at the company over there. But I know there's a lot

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:15.740
of stuff that people didn't like, especially recently. I'm not sure if that all started with

02:14:15.740 --> 02:14:21.020
John Riccitello. But like, there's a lot of things that they don't like where unity is going with

02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:26.940
stuff. So you know, quest buster has some a plus takes in the chat and says, No way unity is doing

02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:31.900
well. It's behind Honkai star rail and Genshin impact among many other games. Yeah, those are

02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:36.940
huge games on Twitch right now. And pointing out also this is the I think really the a plus comment

02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:43.900
but unity doesn't have Fortnite to fund it. Facts. That is a big, big facts.

02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:52.140
Yeah. VX Jason XV Hello Hello says unity epic cry where I don't know if source two is still viable,

02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:55.660
but I know it's out there. So yeah, all right. There are other options. Good to know.

02:14:57.180 --> 02:15:03.100
All right. Well options on where to get your news about Zelda tears of the kingdom. You know,

02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:07.260
again, this is going to be all over the all over Twitch the day this game is released. That's for

02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:10.860
sure everywhere Friday, all these streamers are going to be playing it. But if you want,

02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:14.540
you can watch the official Nintendo stream because there is going to be an official

02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:18.860
Nintendo treehouse live showcase just before release. And you know,

02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:22.860
Nintendo will be shutting down all of those streams that dare to play this game before

02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:29.100
release. Although I don't know how they're going to do that with Europe, because actually Japan

02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:33.500
will have at first. So technically streamers in Europe and Japan aren't going to be breaking the

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:39.020
law if they play. I hope they don't do that. That happened with some other game is that they shut

02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:42.940
down all these European streamers saying the game's not out yet, but it's like, no, it was

02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:50.540
out in Europe. It just wasn't out in the U S yet. So they better be careful. All right. Anyway,

02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:58.780
there's going to be an official treehouse stream on May 11th, the day before the game launches.

02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:03.740
There will be a Nintendo treehouse live. That's going to be the game counting down to its release

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:08.940
up to the midnight launch of Legend of Zelda, but I'm assuming that's midnight East coast time.

02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:17.500
The stream starts at 9 45 Eastern time. And that's, yeah, gonna, gonna be something you

02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:21.820
can watch while you tick down to the game, actually being available and unlocked on your

02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:29.020
system. Fun. All right. But look out for spoilers. I would suggest if you do go to

02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:33.900
watch that stream, hide the chat, because if I were a troll, I'm not, but if I were,

02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:37.980
that would be the number one place I'd go to, to start screaming out spoilers. So hide the

02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:44.620
chat if you do go to watch that stream. All right. With that, let's get to the listener round table.

02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:49.180
We'd love to hear your comments and feedback. We're going to open up our discord over at

02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:52.780
vognetwork.com slash discord. But first I think we actually have a couple of emails

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:58.460
that came in tonight over at participate at orange lounge, radio.com. There's okay.

02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:09.260
Yeah, we got some. So going to the first one, if it will open, come on. Thank you. Oh my God.

02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:16.540
Okay. Oh, big font. Okay. Hi. It's I can't see from Twitch and discord. The eighties and nineties

02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:21.740
TV and mall talk takes me back. As far as the eighties, nineties TV, there should be a database

02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:26.860
or guide that lists where these iconic shows are available. Have you seen the night court reboot?

02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:33.660
Please spell out your words. People don't like the writing, but it has that eighties, early nineties

02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:41.100
sitcom vibe that may either be the laugh tracks or, or, or how they record it. As far as malls,

02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:46.380
my area still has a smaller mall, which is always packed as far as the accessibility modes and

02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:52.940
sliders. I agree about slugs and snails. Sorry. I just vomited in my mouth a little bit.

02:17:55.020 --> 02:18:04.460
Just the, the mention of them just as, as, as horizon, the whole flip-flop of the review bomb

02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:12.140
crowd confuses me to no end. What PS I'm, Oh, I'm a straight white man and I don't like where

02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:17.980
the U S is headed. Sorry to get political. As far as cloud gaming, people comparing Stadia

02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:21.740
to streaming services and subscriptions, it was more like a storefront steam, et cetera,

02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:27.980
in the cloud description, akin to O GPS plus games with gold or even humble bum, dual subscription.

02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:34.780
I beg to differ. It was both. You could buy your games. You also had access to free games that

02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:41.980
came with your subscription. So it was both. Side note, Luna is a subscription. There have

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:48.940
been people who want the ability to buy games there. My brain, I have to make myself remember

02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:55.260
that PPL is people. Also people complain about the series. So why don't they allow Game Pass

02:18:55.260 --> 02:19:01.180
subscribers to play purchased games on X cloud? People also complain about large file sizes,

02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:11.340
but we cloud gamers were ahead of the curve. Also Nintendo uses EBITDAS. As far as the classic game

02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:16.300
or non-game of the week, I am, am I the only one who thinks that some of these board games

02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:19.420
that have been featured mentioned or would make great multiplayer video games,

02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:24.060
mainly the ones that have electronic components, moving parts, examples, the Omega virus,

02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:29.340
Forbidden Bridge and Crossfire. Anyway, I thought I'd give some general thoughts in the last episode

02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:35.340
as well as others that have been rattling around in my head. Cool. Thank you. You covered a lot of

02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:39.020
ground in that email. I'm worried I'm going to miss some points, but I think I caught the new

02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:43.900
Night Court reboot, which sadly, no, I haven't watched it, but I've heard as far as like these

02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:47.980
reboots of old shows go, I've heard it's one of the better ones. So it's one of those, I'll have

02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:54.220
to binge it at some point and catch up on it. What was the other thing I wanted to mention?

02:19:54.220 --> 02:20:00.380
Oh, the Xbox part, because that kind of caught me off guard. He, he said you can't play your

02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:08.380
purchased games on xCloud. I thought you could if it was digital, but maybe I am mixing that

02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:13.740
up with Game Pass because I do happen to have Game Pass, but you have to have, you know what,

02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:19.180
you have to have the rights for cloud streaming. You know what it is? There isn't anything they

02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:24.380
don't have the rights for cloud streaming on that isn't on Game Pass because that's how Microsoft's

02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:29.100
been doing it. So I think I see the point being made. That's, I never stopped to think about that

02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:37.740
though. That is interesting. I, I feel like though, as more and more devices get more cloud

02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:45.900
gaming. And again, I think we are just 5g over the air accessibility, more of that. I think in

02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:52.860
about five years, we're going to really see much more cloud gaming through 5g over air, um, to

02:20:52.860 --> 02:21:01.420
revisiting some of those conversations. So anyway, um, I think I hit on all the key points I wanted

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:05.660
to respond to. Oh, I, there was also, I'm sorry, there was one passage in there. He said something

02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:10.460
like, uh, he had a political opinion, but I'm, I'm a straight white man and I don't agree with

02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:14.700
where this country is headed sometimes. Look, I, I'm not straight and I don't always agree with

02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:19.740
everything either. Like this, this country is without getting too political, but it's going

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:26.940
to happen sometimes. There's just so much inaction that's happening as you see people

02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:34.300
really rooting themselves in polar opposites. There are certain straight white men who need

02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:41.260
to be removed. Certain ones, yes, but certain ones are fine. Loki's good. Loki can stay.

02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:49.900
And I can't see has conducted himself with a wonderful grace and so forth. I don't see how

02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:57.420
he's a problem. Um, anyway. And, and I do need to explain. Um, I, I, I had no problem with

02:21:57.420 --> 02:22:03.500
abbreviations in the email, really. It's just my brain, the way I process information. Um,

02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:09.340
I read by the shape of a word, which is how a lot of people read. But for me, if the shape is

02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:16.060
not in a logical pattern, it's an autism thing with me. Like I actually literally stop and my

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:22.780
brain has to reset where I am until I get used to it. So this one is to say that's honestly,

02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:30.060
that's where 90% of my grammatical problems come from is just that general, the way it looks,

02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:32.780
not necessarily the way it is. Does that make sense?

02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:39.020
Yeah. I think of those tests I've seen where it's like the letters are reversed,

02:22:39.020 --> 02:22:42.700
but the words the same length and you should still be able to read this. Like I've seen little

02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:47.260
things like that. So I understand when you say I look for a word to be a certain length. Like I,

02:22:47.260 --> 02:22:52.060
I've seen weird memes that kind of flex that trait. Yeah.

02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:56.780
And that's typically, um, we actually went through this in history of typography

02:22:56.780 --> 02:23:04.060
is that the standard reader, this is why it's not a good idea to have all of your stuff in all,

02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:10.220
uh, capital text because of a good reader will read the shape of a word.

02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:16.460
Um, whereas a poor reader is going to stop and try to spell out each letter in the word. They're

02:23:16.460 --> 02:23:24.700
not going to see the picture of it. Um, but at the same time, you know, when people have different,

02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:30.380
you know, neurological issues, sometimes that doesn't work out in one's favor.

02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:35.020
Interesting though, reading something by the shape of the word, I can actually see that

02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:40.300
institute. Yeah, I get that. There's actually a test you can perform that if you take two,

02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:46.140
uh, two same phrases, one in capitals, one in lowercase, and then you cut off the midpoint

02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:53.500
on every word and then show it from the bottom up or from the halfway point up,

02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:57.980
you can still read the words in lowercase. Not so easy in every case.

02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:03.100
Interesting. All right. Anyway, there's some, there's a psychology of typography.

02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:08.700
Let's see. We've had a typography tangents, uh, Ironman Stewart on Twitter. Uh, what else

02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:12.380
this week's episode of OLR going to bring tangent wise. All right.

02:24:12.940 --> 02:24:19.260
Dan got me pizza and it was delicious. Yeah. And I can't see, I understand that, um,

02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:22.700
that you're legally blind and that's why, you know, it was perfectly okay.

02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:29.820
It's just the way my brain operates and I had to stop and go, what? Okay. But yeah.

02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:34.460
I feel like that might be your way of saying, don't take it personally. If I'm like,

02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:38.540
why is this word shortened or what have you like, you just need a minute.

02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:46.780
I think that to everyone I have to reset. Um, anyway, last email. Um, hi guys, Misha here.

02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:51.660
I wanted to do a last minute game of the week for you guys. This week's games include included

02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:57.660
on Xbox. I played red fall. Um, now I know many people hate the game, but I can see why,

02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:04.860
but I'm having a lot of fun with it. It's your typical, uh, looter shooter type game to me.

02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:09.900
It's like back for blood, but with vamps, it may or may not be better with co-op,

02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:15.900
but here's the thing I don't like. There is no couch co-op. Like I thought would be like,

02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:20.860
I thought it would be, and that's what I was expecting and didn't get. Other than,

02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:26.300
other than that, it is a good game for what it is. That's pretty much been my game this

02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:29.100
week outside of Nino Cooney on switch. Sincerely, Misha.

02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:33.020
Well, thanks Misha. I know you're one of the people that were like red falls,

02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:36.780
not as bad as everyone's saying it is, but that's it. I had no idea about the, uh,

02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:40.300
lack of couch co-op. That's really important to a lot of people.

02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:46.140
I also really appreciate how I can't see use the very, very big fun. It made it so

02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:51.100
much easier to read. Cause all the other emails are like, I need a microscope.

02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:56.940
Well, I think that's just default is I wonder if that can be changed in the reader,

02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:01.340
but I don't know. I don't know to be honest. It can, but it was just like, Oh, font.

02:26:02.460 --> 02:26:07.980
Nice. Yeah. Um, no, I mean, I can read down to a four point font, so

02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:15.660
Oh, I just need to take off my glasses and get the monocle, but no seriously. Cause, um,

02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:20.060
I'm supposed to actually have progressives, but the thing is it because I'm super nearsighted.

02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:24.620
When I take off my glasses, I get super close vision, like microscopic vision. It's so,

02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:30.380
but, but without my glasses, I can't see shit. I see blurs and not the band.

02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:36.140
Um, Misha and chat says that reminds me, LOL. Is there a way to make the font bigger? Cause I even

02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:41.340
have a hard time reading this. The, the quick and dirty way to try is, and it depends on your

02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:45.580
browser, but hold the control key and use your scroll wheel to go up and down. Cause that'll

02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:49.740
change the font, but that you can have mixed results with that. So do it slowly so you can

02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:53.740
revert it back. If you don't like it. I believe it's very similar on a PC to how it is on a Mac

02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.780
or on a Mac it's command plus to zoom. I think you can control plus to zoom on a PC. That is

02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:04.540
what Jason's actually confirming control equals, which is the same key. I think. Yeah. So yeah,

02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:09.660
something to play with. All right. Um, anyhow, that was it for emails, right?

02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:17.100
Um, yeah, that's it. All right. Uh, I was surprised that there was more than one.

02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:21.820
Yeah. Yeah. I guess me threatening to pull the plug on emails got people to say, Oh,

02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:25.980
nevermind also. So I, I feel bad. I guilted people into it, but at the same time,

02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:30.300
it's been lovely to hear from people in the mailbag. So maybe I don't feel bad. All right.

02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:37.340
Participate at orange lounge radio.com. If you would like to say hello, uh, uh, this next week,

02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:41.500
uh, we'd love that. I don't see any calls waiting in the green room, which is fine. Cause we're

02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:46.460
coming up on about two and a half hours. So I do want to check in though, to see if there are any,

02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:51.580
uh, last minute stories from Loki or dark Sakura. There are not. Yeah. I feel like we,

02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:55.420
we hit them all this week. There wasn't as many this week as there usually are probably because of

02:27:56.060 --> 02:28:01.020
Japan's golden week. But, um, I'm sure we'll see some more next week. And especially when we start

02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:06.060
to get into early June, it's going to ramp up. Then again, I also expect the gaming industry

02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:12.060
to be very quiet on Friday. Cause most people. Golden state pinball festival.

02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:18.780
I want to check that out. It'd be fun. Is it running on Friday? Cause I can go on Friday.

02:28:18.780 --> 02:28:21.260
Friday's Saturday and Sunday. Maybe I'll go on Friday.

02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:26.060
I I'm still got work, so I don't know what's going to happen.

02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:30.380
Okay. We'll compare notes. All right. I might have, I might have to blow some time.

02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:33.900
I also want to go to, um, California extreme if that's happening again,

02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:38.380
but watch this happening. I think it's probably going to be the same weekend that I'm

02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:42.620
planning on going somewhere else, which I'm hoping I can finally talk about next week.

02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:47.740
So, and, um, well, and then there's Twitch con coming up.

02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:48.940
Yes. Yeah.

02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:56.220
Which I, I finally have made enough money from Twitch to pay for my damn ticket.

02:28:56.220 --> 02:28:59.500
Oh, that's great. Wait, are Twitch con tickets available?

02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:07.260
Uh, I think so. I saw something about them posting them and then they weren't on the site.

02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:08.460
So maybe soon.

02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:14.300
Oh, Ooh. I can't see reminds me that this coming weekend is the next Diablo open beta.

02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:17.180
That's right. Diablo 4 has another open beta this weekend.

02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:21.740
I have plans Saturday though. So I don't know how much I'll really get to dive into that.

02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:24.700
We'll see. Change your plans then.

02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:28.700
I know change my plans for a video game. I mean, I've done it before. All right.

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:37.020
I've been sitting here going, do I take Friday before my birthday off and say it's because of

02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:42.300
my birthday, but in my heart, I know it's to play a certain FF16, but we'll see. All right.

02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:43.980
What did I do for my birthday?

02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:45.340
You did a subathon.

02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:46.700
I took the whole fucking week off.

02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:53.100
I can't, I can't take that much time off. I mean, I can, but I just know like I have

02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:56.700
these other things I'm doing that yeah, I'd rather have the time for.

02:29:56.700 --> 02:30:02.380
Yeah. For, for me, things worked out and my work gives us a three days for the Thanksgiving holiday,

02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:05.740
except in my group, we get to take them whenever we want through a certain period of time.

02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:09.580
So I took them off for my birthday and then took a bonus day off. Cause I work a four 10.

02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:15.660
That's the show and I'm at is our Google champion tonight saying California extreme is August 19th

02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:20.780
through 20th. Excellent. That is a free weekend for me right now. I kind of, I kind of really

02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:24.620
want to do it this year. I have, I haven't done it for like fucking 10 years.

02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:27.340
I talked to Melody about it. Melody has a room.

02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:28.540
Oh yeah.

02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:33.260
And I basically were like, you know, I'm going to crash out at some point in your room during

02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:37.660
the middle of the day. So yeah. We're going.

02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:38.940
Okay. Good times.

02:30:40.300 --> 02:30:40.940
At least a day.

02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:47.900
I don't blame you. All right. Final thoughts time. Before I turn it around for final thoughts,

02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:51.260
I want to say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was your first

02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:56.140
episode or your 959th episode, we appreciate you being here. Thank you so much for being in our

02:30:56.140 --> 02:31:01.100
chat or just listening along with the show on our podcast feed. We appreciate you being here.

02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:03.980
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend or two,

02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:06.700
help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:10.380
but we need more voices to put out here on air. Definitely need that.

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:15.740
Tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on a

02:31:15.740 --> 02:31:20.460
site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show, that all goes an awful long way

02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:24.860
as well. We super appreciate all of that. Okay. With that, let's get final thoughts.

02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:29.580
DarkSagra. I almost said Loki, but DarkSagra, you're going to go do your stream. So your

02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:30.060
final thought.

02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:35.500
I am. I don't know if I'm going to do killer, but if enough people pop in and folks want to play

02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:39.820
with me, I'd love to open up the lobby and just run a muck in the fog.

02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:40.780
A muck, a muck, a muck.

02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:42.940
Yep. A muck.

02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:44.620
All right. Have fun with a muck.

02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:46.540
See y'all later, taters.

02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:49.820
See ya. All right. Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:54.220
My final thought is I'm going to be busy. Hopefully you'll see a new episode for me

02:31:54.220 --> 02:31:54.940
later this week.

02:31:55.980 --> 02:32:00.940
Awesome. My final thought, two parts. Number one part, I'll be streaming more Stranger

02:32:00.940 --> 02:32:04.940
of Paradise this week, at least probably until I beat it. I might as well see the game through

02:32:04.940 --> 02:32:08.780
to completion and I am playing on Bobby. No, I'm not playing on Bobby Black Wolf mode

02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:12.700
completely because the game can get even easier than where I'm playing it now, but I'm on

02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:17.020
pretty easy mode to be honest. I'm playing in story mode, but it's good. So I'm hoping

02:32:17.020 --> 02:32:20.140
to get through that game this week and then probably I'll go back to the Pixel remasters

02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:25.580
if nothing else. But also I just want to make sure I plug Dragon Con. I know I talk about

02:32:25.580 --> 02:32:29.420
it a lot. Bobby talks about it a lot, but it is coming up this Labor Day weekend. Alan

02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:33.660
is going for the first time. He's not going as a guest, sadly, and I think he's a little

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:37.580
shy about doing panels that Akani doesn't know very well, but he'll be there. I'll be

02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:41.820
there and I will certainly be doing panels, whatever they'll give me, as will Bobby.

02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:45.820
I've heard some early, I can't say anything. Maybe I'm already saying too much. I've

02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:52.780
heard some early things on what type of panels there might be this year and I'm really

02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:56.700
excited. That's all I can say. Of course I'm going to say that though, right? But I

02:32:56.700 --> 02:33:03.420
mean it. I really do. All right. Let's see. I think that's it. It's time to wrap up

02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:07.020
and get on out of here for the night. Thank you for being here. We'll be back next week,

02:33:07.580 --> 02:33:12.380
May 14th, with the latest and greatest. I'm sure plenty of your impressions on

02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:16.700
Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. We're ready to hear them. So enjoy. Happy Zelda Day to those

02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:19.660
that celebrate. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next week. Bye.

02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:32.540
