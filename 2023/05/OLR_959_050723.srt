1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Another $70 flagship launch, another critical whiff in terms of bugs, polish and consistency.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,960
Will Redfall become a No Man's Sky or a Cyberpunk 2077? Ask me again in 5 years. Every flagship

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,780
title must be a critical hit in order to preserve money, yet cult classic Final Fantasies have

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,760
now been allowed in numerous remasters. Which one is more valuable?

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,800
This is your knot. Everything is up for an update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,680
Roberts, Jamie Sommerson, Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,920
week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:45,520
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,720
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:01,040
number 959 of our show for tonight, May the 7th of 2023. I can't believe it. It is May

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,760
already. Hi, I'm Rob Roberts here with you every week on Sunday nights with my co-hosts

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,840
over there in that little box. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Hi.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,120
Hi, how are you?

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Not high enough.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,120
Hashtag mood.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Huh?

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
I said hashtag mood.

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm a little on the tired and today was another ballet day for me. I did about almost two

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:48,680
hours of just, oh, let me fix my camera, of just stretching and the actual ballet and

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:58,360
then the recovery stretching and then the massage gun and all of the foam rollers and

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,120
everything and the feet soaking in ice buckets and all of that. And I have mad respect for

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,560
the pros. I only did this for more like an hour and 45 minutes, but the ones that go

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,680
and do this as their job. Oh, hell.

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,200
Still, it sounds like it's been a super healthy and fun little, I guess, hobby for you. Lifestyle

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
edition, maybe.

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,040
I have something interesting about it is that, well, I had a doctor's appointment on Friday

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,720
to have my back looked at because I had been having some pretty bad back pain before. And

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:43,400
a lot of it has fixed itself with having done ballet. I still have the pains, but that's

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,640
from activity now and I'm still getting that cortisone shot in my hip. But I've noticed

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,680
that since practicing my turnout, where the feet, that it all comes from the hips, I have

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,440
better hip rotation. My back has been better. I watch my posture more often. My flexibility

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,760
is getting better. I mean, I'm not anywhere near where I want to be or where I used to

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,280
be, but I'm getting there. And it's just something about getting up and doing something and challenging

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
myself.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,960
Well, it reminds me of the days when this show started, when you, me, and hi in the

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,920
other box, Techmaster Loki, hello, hello. When all three of us got together playing

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,200
a Dance Dance Revolution. I was never skinnier. Even today, after I've lost all that weight

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,200
since 2022, I'm still not as skinny as I was back when we played DDR several times

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,040
a week. And I mean several, like three or four times a week playing hours of DDR. I

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,400
was never skinnier than that phase.

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Right now I'm doing two hours of ballet every week for now. But I'm actually, I want to

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,800
bring out the Dreamcast and play a second mix. My dance pads are so slippery because

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,320
the two layers of plastic, because I have official Konami pads and they're dated at

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,480
this point, which doesn't help. Yeah. And it's funny. I was watching a video too about

46
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,680
like all of the various codes for all of the DDR machines and it was kind of, I put it

47
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,160
up on my Twitter. I was like, anyone remember this?

48
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,480
Well for actually just real quick, let me, let me pivot on that note over to Techmaster

49
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,080
Loki, because Loki, you were tweeting about DDR machine stuff this week. Did you, you

50
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,360
got back on the extreme in your garage this week, right?

51
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,320
Yeah, I did. Cause I had to hook it back up again. So it still works.

52
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,280
That's well, that's good. It still works.

53
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,840
Yeah. It's go fake, you know, like arcade hardware from the nineties versus computer

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:50,760
from the 2010s, 2020. I think it was like nine, not long ago, like late 2010s, you know,

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,680
arcade hardware still fine. Computer's like, no, I can't take, I can't take the weather.

56
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,080
So well,

57
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,640
I'm glad everything still works. How was playing after so long?

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:10,000
I mean, it's, you know, you have to keep just dialing back to, you know, as easy as you

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,880
can because it's like your mind, you're like, Oh yeah, I could do that. And then your body's

60
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,360
like, no, you can't. So, I mean, it's obviously, you know, I used to play like pretty high

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,880
end, like doubles and stuff. So now it's just, I mean, this is what it was like too. I remember

62
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,200
like coming back into it, like from a long time when I first got the machine, it was,

63
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,620
you know, starting off singles and doing, you know, I think it was like five to six

64
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:46,460
footer songs. I think now I'm doing, yeah, like four to six. And it's, I was doing the non-stop

65
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,620
site. I tend to do a pop four all the time. Cause it's kind of like middle of the road,

66
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,860
like pretty easy stuff just to get your stamina back up. And because it is a lot when you're,

67
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,060
you haven't done it a while. It's not, I mean, for one, yeah, it's stamina, like very tired

68
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,220
too. Your muscles will like hurt a lot, obviously from not doing it for a while. So it's just

69
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,940
getting used to it again. So it just has to, I have to keep doing it regularly and they'll,

70
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,980
he'll come back somewhat. Yeah, that's definitely the regularity is definitely the key.

71
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,620
I also want to say hello to our folks in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at

72
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,140
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,

73
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,980
even though he wasn't here tonight, he was on a personal trip. But we do tape live on Sunday

74
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,500
nights at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash V O G network. Bobby will be back next week.

75
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,220
He starts an hour before we do, and we will be here next week. We will not be here live in

76
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,180
two weeks. It's not a holiday or anything. It's just a very random day job conflict for me.

77
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,740
So ironically, I believe Bobby had a day job conflict thing today. That's why he wasn't

78
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,620
live and I have one in two weeks. It just, that's the way it goes sometimes.

79
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,660
Also, I may not be here next week because of a Golden State Pinball festival.

80
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,060
Oh.

81
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,980
So this is the only day I can attend.

82
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,020
Oh, dang. I kind of want to check that out to be honest. Where's, is that in Lodi?

83
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,780
Because they had a big Comic-Con there today. I went to the same place. Yeah, they did.

84
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,540
It's Lodi. I don't pay attention much.

85
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,740
Yeah. One of the voice actors.

86
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,700
Sorry Lodi people.

87
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,460
No, one of the voice actors I met at Dragon Con was supposed to be a guest there.

88
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,620
And I noticed on Twitter had to cancel out just, he had, he had an unfortunate situation in his

89
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,260
family. So yeah, he had to back out, but I saw, I was like, Oh, Lodi. I was like, Oh,

90
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,420
which for those that don't know, which I assume would be most people outside this general area,

91
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,180
it's like, it's a suburb of SAC, but kind of, it's like 45 minutes South maybe. That might be

92
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,220
actually be a little, it depends what part of town you're coming from. Yeah.

93
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,220
It's like maybe a 25 to 30 minute drive for me from where I am.

94
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,340
Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,500
So it's not bad. And the venue is actually, you know, pretty good for what it is.

96
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,340
But I mean, last year they had Weird Al, which I would assume they're going to have it again

97
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,620
this year. Our Weird Al should be arriving before too long.

98
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,180
That's awesome.

99
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:22,620
But, but yeah. But there's a few other tables that I'm really interested in looking at and

100
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,180
I couldn't, I mean, there's a chance I might be able to do some on Saturday.

101
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:35,500
And if you want to go together, Rob, we can, I can try to get the half day and see if we can go.

102
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,220
I actually have tentative plans on Saturday. So ironically, Sunday would be the only day I could

103
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,580
go to. So we'll have to see. I would just have to leave early. So we'll see. We'll see.

104
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,940
All right. But anyhow, let's get into the show tonight. Actually, one other quick note,

105
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,580
I do want to point out from chat because I have been reading chat. And by the way, I just,

106
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,180
we had a hype train going and you all have been very generous with your bits and subs.

107
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,260
So I just want to, you know, usually, you know, we don't read those live. Like most Twitch streamers

108
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,620
will stop what they're doing and acknowledge that. But since we are taping a podcast,

109
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,420
which of course you can download on iTunes, Spotify, all the places that you find podcasts,

110
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,020
we don't usually stop for all those. But you know, when you all go above and beyond especially and

111
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,220
do the hype trains and all that, I have to say something. So thank you for your generosity.

112
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,540
I really appreciate that. But several people in chat noting that Loki behind you tonight,

113
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:33,100
you have streaming some gameplay of Revolution X, the classic Aerosmith shooty bang, bang gallery

114
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,540
game. Why Revolution X tonight? Is this because of their farewell tour that the tickets are going

115
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,620
on sale or whatever? Oh yeah, I forgot about that. No, it's not about that. No, it's more of,

116
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,460
I didn't know what I wanted to put behind me. And because I went to the Hard Rock

117
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:56,540
casino last night to go see Ali Wong, I just thought, you know, music and yeah, it just kind of.

118
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,660
No, that works. I haven't been out there at all. How is that venue? Is it nice out there?

119
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,820
It's nice. I mean, it looks new for sure. I mean, I got tagged in a TikTok or something

120
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,460
because they're doing an ABBA dance party up there. And I was like, oh, maybe. Yeah,

121
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,380
they have something. They have something Drag Race related. Oh, the official Work the World Tour is

122
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,060
going there. Yeah. Yeah. And like some Diana Ross thing as well. So like they kept like showing that

123
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,780
like on the screens advertising the different venues they're coming. I'm tempted. Dark

124
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,940
Sakurai. You want to go see? I don't even know who's on that tour, but I imagine it's all the

125
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:39,340
queens. If Sasha Kolbe is on it, I mean, I'll go see mom. I haven't watched the last couple of

126
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,260
seasons, so I might be behind a little bit. I might catch up. I rarely watch it anymore,

127
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,140
but you know, you just, you see the clips are hard to dodge on social media, you know,

128
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,380
of all the big moments. So. Especially with our crowd. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's get into news

129
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,660
and what's going on in the gaming world. We're going to start off with this. Loki,

130
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,380
I don't know if you want to talk about this. I have it up if you don't though.

131
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,060
Yeah, I can talk about it. So it's more of Nintendo being Nintendo. So

132
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:16,300
you may remember that not that long ago, like a week or two, there was a whole thing about Bowser

133
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:24,060
and getting arrested for, you know, the whole creating mod chips and stuff for the Wii and

134
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,100
all that. Not done Bowser, but another guy named Bowser. The third Bowser.

135
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:37,660
Not the king of the Koopas. Bowser had seven kids, so let's not forget.

136
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,060
All the Koopalings are getting in different lines of business. Yeah. So this one is in regards to

137
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:51,020
the data DMCA takedown requests to GitHub to remove a piece of software called Lockpick,

138
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:58,620
which is a tool for dumping your system keys from your own switch. The reason that people are upset

139
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,940
about this because this does not actually prevent piracy that's been most prevalent with the switch,

140
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,140
which is emulation because emulators don't need these keys in order to play games on it.

141
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,940
And it's weird, though, that they're like even coming after this because this doesn't necessarily

142
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,860
enable piracy either. It's just like it's a tool to do something.

143
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,340
They want complete control, though. Yeah. I mean, Nintendo can't be happy. I mean,

144
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,980
and I know you have a coupling story with this, but I think a lot of people that follow gaming

145
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,060
know. Well, I think everybody that follows gaming knows that this Friday is a very big day in the

146
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,100
Zelda universe. Obviously, the long wait for the sequel to Breath of the Wild is over. And Friday,

147
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:50,620
Tears of the Kingdom comes out. And I bet there's multiple people in chat who have the day off work

148
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,980
on Friday in acknowledgment of what's going on. And the reason why I bring that up is that

149
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,460
obviously it's a huge target for piracy and no secret that it's already out there. So,

150
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,580
you know, folks know to kind of watch out for spoilers on social media, careful with hashtags

151
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:14,860
because people are, you know, dodging that stuff. DJRomaS in chat says, not me. I could care less

152
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:23,100
about Zelda. Well, let me give a nice hearty, ooh, she's different to that. Yeah. I mean, like,

153
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,460
no, no. I mean, real quick, though, real quick, though, I, I'm not going to pick that up. Here's

154
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,540
the thing. Here's the thing. I'm not going to pick it up right away either because there's just,

155
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,220
there's so much coming out right now that I'm like really interested in, uh, that, you know,

156
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,900
I'll get to Zelda probably later this year. So I understand, I understand it isn't for everyone

157
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:51,420
day one, but I also recognize this is like the series for some people. There are some people

158
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,620
out there that don't care about most video games, but they care about Zelda, you know? So this is a

159
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,220
big day for some folks. I get it. This would be like when Return of the Jedi came out in theaters.

160
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:09,180
Yeah. For some. Yeah, for sure. But the thing is, is that, you know, Dan,

161
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,660
I don't think is playing, I just got him Osmond. Um, but other than that, there's not really any

162
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,500
major new gaming going on in my house. So it's perfect for us. You know, this, this,

163
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,220
this Zelda release, this was Abba's voyage album being released. I, so, you know, for, for me and

164
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,420
not everybody gave a shit. I understand. I respect that, you know, even though everybody, most people

165
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,860
would probably say, Abba, yeah, very impactful on pop music, had a huge mark and so forth.

166
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,700
So I could sit here and say the same thing about Zelda. I get it. I completely get it

167
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,860
when people are losing their minds. Just me personally, probably, probably more towards

168
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,900
the end of the year is when I'll get around to it. And we would just tell Abba thank you for

169
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,940
the music. That's right. That's absolutely right. Anyway. Sorry, Loki. I know you're trying to make

170
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,740
a point. No, no, it's fine. Um, no, it's just, I mean, yeah, it's gonna be a good game. I don't

171
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,820
know if it's like earth shattering or anything. I mean, like, yeah, it's a sequel to, you know,

172
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:11,100
breath of the wild. I watched Celtic play some of it, um, is of course under a partial NDA for,

173
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,500
for some of it, but it looks really, really amazing. I mean, just the innovations that

174
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,940
they've made for the system and everything and brought back a few things that had been in, uh,

175
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,740
intended for the first release, they're able to do in this one and the world building.

176
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:36,540
I have to say, I like the big thing about certain games for me is the immersive factor, you know,

177
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:43,340
the, like the culture that was created inside this little universe, you know, it has a language,

178
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:49,580
it has customs. You can follow the people around as they do stuff in their day, you know, and

179
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,180
that's the kind of thing that I enjoy to see as I like learning more about a universe,

180
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,300
about seeing its lore, you know? And I mean, which is part of the reason why I think I'm so

181
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,740
big into Dead by Daylight, but, um, but that's, that's really the core of it for me is I'm,

182
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,380
I'm excited for learning more about the universe. Now to generally kind of sum up what I, the

183
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,620
discussion I see having in chat right now is that people seem to be on the same page that like

184
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,100
the people that are breaking street date, you know, some people have been so bold as to stream

185
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,580
it, which is a, you know, unless you are an authorized, because I believe they allowed

186
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,660
press embargo to stream like an hour or two on a certain date. And I think that's what Dark

187
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,660
Soccer is referring to too. That's, that's different, but the people that don't have that

188
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,260
and are going beyond, you know, and so forth, uh, just trying to get, you know, internet points,

189
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,420
cool points or something like, obviously people are just irritated with all that and putting out

190
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,220
the spoilers. I think that they're allowing controlled exploration of certain areas.

191
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,820
Probably. Yeah. And sometimes that's what companies will do is say, you may stream

192
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,660
this area up to this point. Like sometimes it gets very specific. I know back when we used to get

193
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,780
that kind of stuff, we would get that sometimes. They were letting Zeltik play ahead and it's,

194
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,940
he's got a pretty long video about it, but there were certain things that he could show,

195
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,660
but not talk about. Like it could be on the screen, but he wasn't allowed to call it out

196
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,340
or certain things that could not be expressly talked about like certain game elements or

197
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,380
different lore in the game. Cause it needed, and this is the whole thing that a company

198
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:41,420
makes its impact by surprise. You know, the whole surprise and delight your, your customers thing.

199
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:50,460
That's, I think Nintendo has been really good about, at least as far as what their,

200
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,700
their products are concerned is that the moment that it comes out, it builds all this mystery

201
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,700
around it. You have people leaking this stuff and there goes the mystery. They're not going

202
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,100
to be so surprised, you know, where the person who doesn't know what they're going to get,

203
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,140
but they have a reputation to go on. They're the ones who are going to be going out and

204
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,620
buying it site and see unreviewed, you know, because it's something that they have particular

205
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:22,700
trust in that brand and they want to be surprised. And I don't fault Nintendo for,

206
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,820
for going all out on this one, you know, for really, really, you know, hammering down those,

207
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,700
those leaks in the rumors because their whole bread and butter for a lot of their games is

208
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,900
how much is it going to surprise and delight their audience?

209
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,940
Well, speaking of bringing the hammer down, Loki, I think there's a second part of this too. And I

210
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,700
saw it got brought up in chat too. Not even really like bringing a hammer down, just Reggie Fils-Aime

211
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,660
memeing on stuff. So yeah, someone posted a screenshot of like, look, I see I'm playing

212
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,300
Tears of a Kingdom on an emulator. And then of course he quoted Liam Neeson's, you know,

213
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:08,380
Taken line, you know, I have a particular set of skills. I mean, yeah, it's cool, but like, okay,

214
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,340
cool. But like, it's also one of those things where it's like, you know, you're fucking around

215
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,780
and you about to find out. Like it's, it's one of those, like you, you knew what you were doing. So

216
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,820
There is one thing you don't fuck with and that's that man's forehead.

217
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,460
Or that man, period. Like you don't fuck with Reggie Fils-Aime period, end of sentence.

218
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,980
Like, it's just, so yeah. Yeah. Mike Defton chat says that kid found out the hard way. Yes.

219
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,540
Well, you know, speaking, okay, to kind of circle it back a little bit to the GitHub conversation

220
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,260
and on the one hand, yes, I understand why Nintendo is being a little bit hypersensitive

221
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:53,740
about emulators because, you know, it's not a great feeling to see this game break street

222
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,580
date by at least a week and a half, if not more, with the people that are playing it and so forth.

223
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,780
So I understand Nintendo is kind of doing a broad swipe. However, as you pointed out, you know,

224
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,860
this, this particular component of getting your key does not in itself lend to piracy. And I think

225
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,820
you said there, the emulators don't even require it. So they don't require it. And so like,

226
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,340
that's the thing is like, that's if you want to play like using like your own system type of thing.

227
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:28,140
But which still a matter of control though, it is. But I also kind of feel like the consumer,

228
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,180
and this has been settled in a court of law is that the consumers do have the entitlement to

229
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:39,180
make one backup copy for their purposes. It's just obviously you can't put that backup copy on

230
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,140
torrent sites and say, Oh, whoops, sorry about that. You're entitled to make a backup copy for

231
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:51,820
yourself. And to be fair to the folks that are doing this, the switch is dating technology.

232
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,100
We all know that that's no secret. I think most people kind of accept that Tears of the Kingdom

233
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,540
is probably going to push this thing about as far as it can go, because it already seems like

234
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,020
it's been crying under the pressures of Pokemon, Scarlet Violet, and some of the other recent

235
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:13,100
releases. So I, I kind of understand why someone might be like, and as long as they can do it in

236
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,820
their own bubble, I'm not talking about streaming it. I'm not talking about putting it out on the

237
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,340
internet. I'm talking about in their own bubble with their own tools on, on get access to,

238
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,420
on get up, taking a copy of their game, playing it on PC and playing it with,

239
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:35,820
you know, the upped, uh, either graphics or just the speed at which piece modern PCs can process

240
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,460
as opposed to a switch. That's the thing too, is that you may run into a situation where you have

241
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,460
a better experience playing emulated than you would on the, that's it. That's it. Because the

242
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:54,300
good game, even though it's a $70 game, by the way, $70 game, and you know how great of a tracker

243
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:03,340
we have at $70 games so far, you know, even if it is a big AAA publisher, like I know it's Nintendo,

244
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,900
but I'm very skeptical that it's going to run smoothly.

245
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:18,380
Here's the thing, ability to run as smooth as a PlayStation 5 or Xbox series game aside,

246
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:27,820
that part aside, I do feel like if anybody is justified with that type of price for a day one

247
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:35,660
release, hold on, it's probably Nintendo in this game. Reason being Nintendo games far more than

248
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,420
their competitors lack those type of day one breaking bugs that you hear about in the games

249
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,140
that other release and they tend to be very well-rounded packages out the gate. I'm sure

250
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,220
this game will have DLC, but it's not going to feel like certain other games that release where

251
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,940
it feels like the DLC is necessary to get the full scope of the game, if that makes sense.

252
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,380
So my point being is that I feel like most of the complaints people have about companies releasing

253
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:11,740
$70 games, like Nintendo, for better or for worse, doesn't seem to fall to those same issues.

254
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,020
But then again, they've never charged $70 until now. So maybe things are going to change. I don't

255
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,500
know. But I do feel like if anybody, Nintendo puts out the better product off the shelf than

256
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,940
most of their peers in gaming, especially when you look at what's going on, you know, I know we'll get

257
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,180
to it later in the show, but what was going on with Microsoft this week, you know, so.

258
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,380
Let's see. Comments in chat. DJ Rama S says, if we were having this conversation like 10 years ago,

259
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,380
I wouldn't have cared. I'd bootleg all the games. Fuck your feelings. But when you have friends who

260
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,860
work in the industry and you learn more about the inner workings, can't support piracy. Yeah. And I

261
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,260
want to make clear, we don't endorse piracy too. And everything I just said there, I'm talking

262
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,740
about you with your Switch, your game, your PC. Sure. Maybe using some tools on GitHub,

263
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,340
but it's, you're still buying the game. You're still buying everything you need to make it

264
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:09,100
happen. You're just making it happen your own way, which I do feel like you ought to be able to do.

265
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:18,220
So let's see. Other comments in chat. Mike Def does point out they did charge $70 in the 90s.

266
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,580
You know, some of those cartridge games. That's why cartridge got to be an expensive format.

267
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,620
That is a fair point. Dark Tetsuya says, I know there have been Nintendo games launching with

268
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,420
issues, but I feel like it's few and far between. And usually not long before those issues are

269
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,660
patched up. Oh yes. I was very, I chose my words very carefully there. And I didn't want to say

270
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,100
these games launch with no issues. I wanted to say compared to their peers, they launched with

271
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:48,220
the least amount of issues, I think is the better way to phrase that. So anyway. Loki,

272
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,580
any other thoughts on that before we move on to our gaming weeks and all that?

273
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:59,180
No, I just think Nintendo is still like, because emulation is legal. So like, I think

274
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,860
attacking emulation, especially with GitHub, because they like GitHub is a smaller company.

275
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,460
And Microsoft buy it, ironically? Um, I mean, guess so. But like, I was,

276
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,100
I still assume that they're running kind of separately from Microsoft. So they're probably

277
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,020
complying with a lot of these DMCA takedown notices without fighting it because, you know,

278
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,860
they're not gonna stick their neck out to try to protect something that is been, you know, shown

279
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,900
to have precedent to be safe and okay, they're just gonna take it down so they can have their

280
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,100
safe harbor status. But also at the same time, I think some of these companies abuse that because

281
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,700
they're like, well, what are they gonna do fight us on it, they're not gonna fight us on it,

282
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,300
because we'll sue them if they fight us on it. And even if they may be entitled to do that or not.

283
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:54,540
Like, for example, you know, when people are cease and desisting, like, just footed gameplay footage

284
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,780
that appears online. Yeah, technically, it's your game and stuff. But like, I don't know, it's I

285
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,180
feel like that that shouldn't just because your game leaked out. First off, just because your

286
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,140
game leaked out. That's your fault. Honestly, like, it's your fault for staging your deliveries

287
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,340
that damn early that it got leaked out. Why are you shipping this product to stores a week in

288
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,860
fucking advance? Don't do that then. Because when I used to work at a distributor, like mom and pop

289
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,420
stuff, which which they always blame the mom pop shops, but it's always the mass retailers that end

290
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,140
up leaking that crap out. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. First off, because the mom pop shops are like,

291
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,620
I ain't leaking this stuff out. Like I can hardly get this stuff on time, let alone you know,

292
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:41,420
trying to get that like early, like a week early. Um, so it's big box for sure that to blame for

293
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,020
that. I mean, track it down there. Like maybe you should not stage your stuff so damn early than if

294
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,540
you're worried about it leaking out. Or like, implement something that you have to unlock it

295
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,860
at a certain time. Like I know you do that digitally. But like, and I guess that doesn't

296
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:02,220
necessarily work in, you know, if a console can't connect to the internet, but there's got to be a

297
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,940
way that you could do something. Yeah, I wouldn't be easily defeated. But you know, I just, I don't

298
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:15,100
get the blame on people stupid. I don't feel sorry for Nintendo about the the game leaking out early

299
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,940
because you I think you illustrated it very well. How that happened. I do feel bad for the fans.

300
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,300
Because inevitably human behavior, especially in a lot of pop culture, specifically nerd culture,

301
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,900
including the umbrella of gaming, people have this desire to one up other people and prove that

302
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,540
they're the coolest kid in town because they got to do said thing first. And sometimes people will

303
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:42,380
do that by putting spoilers out there like, you know, the boat sinks or you know, those these

304
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:50,220
types of big spoilers for games to assert them assert some type of strange dominance over others.

305
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,860
And that's that's where I feel bad. But I don't feel bad for Nintendo. I feel bad for the fans.

306
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,940
Because people don't know how to behave themselves. That's that's what it is.

307
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,700
Um, let's see, actually, I want to mention this real quick too, before we get into gaming weeks,

308
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,780
because E3VL asked a very good question that we all kind of run on an assumption on and we

309
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,540
probably need to stop assuming that everybody knows things like this. E3VL says, what is GitHub

310
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:23,500
anyway? Great question. GitHub is basically, as I understand it, a repository for code,

311
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,060
especially for like people that want to work on something either transparent, transparently,

312
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:36,060
or sort of crowdsource, you know, help with code. Now, obviously, this also means you can

313
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,420
put code up there. And you know, everybody can grab it and compile it. Yeah, it's also

314
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:47,900
different applications. It's also for like different. What's the actual terminology for

315
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,980
it's, it allows you to basically store snapshots of your code. So for example,

316
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,780
if I'm working on a project or something like that, I would send over here's my project or

317
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,740
whatever that I've made. And then I make changes to it. And then I send another update to that.

318
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,060
And then if something breaks, I can go back to it's basically a version history, store different

319
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:16,140
revisions of your code. Yeah, sure, you can work on it collaboratively as well. But it's basically

320
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,300
a repo site that you can just store versions of your code, you can see changes, you can,

321
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,660
you know, fork it off. So like, if I wanted, if I was developing something, and someone wanted

322
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:33,980
to take that as a base and develop something else, they could do that. Wikipedia, but for the project

323
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:41,260
you're working on with code, basically, in a way, not really exact, like, I'm trying to, I'm trying

324
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,540
to simplify it, though, for everybody, Loki, like, I know, there's, there's nuances. But also,

325
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,780
and I kind of want to point out with this, the irony is, sure, Nintendo DMCAs GitHub,

326
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,900
and I'm sure they took it down. But part of the reason why people put it up on GitHub in the first

327
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,140
place is because now it's on the internet, everybody can literally grab the code and compile

328
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:08,700
their own versions, like, Nintendo did nothing to stop the distribution of this. Because, and

329
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,060
honestly, you know, and I love every, I know everybody loves to overuse that Streisand effect

330
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:19,020
comparison. But that's what it is. And that is the whole like, when a company does something like

331
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:25,660
this, they only shine a spotlight on it, because everybody reports on it. And that name comes from

332
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:31,100
when Barbra Streisand tried to stop photos of her house being published, then everybody ran the

333
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:37,020
story with a picture of the house in question. So it's that whole type of thing is that Nintendo

334
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:42,460
probably only brought a spotlight to this tool. And what is because I, I never knew this was a

335
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,300
thing. Until here, we are talking about it now. I never knew this was a thing.

336
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:52,620
Yeah. And especially when you consider like, you know, that modding your console is probably going

337
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:58,700
to be more risky than just downloading and playing the games on your PC. Plus, they'll run better.

338
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,900
Plus, you can just run them off Steam Deck, which is going to run it just fine. And if there's more

339
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:10,860
powerful Steam Deck type consoles or computers coming out, like, okay, cool. Now I don't need

340
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,620
those keys. So what have you really done? You've you've driven people to now figure out, Oh, hey,

341
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,820
this is way much easier than the other stuff. I'm just gonna do this instead. Yeah, less people

342
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,900
buying. I gotta admit, I'm, I'm legit curious about how a switch game might run on my PC and

343
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,620
how all I can bought it. Now I don't, I'm not going to be brazen enough to stream it or do

344
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,980
anything. There's just for my own little tee-hees in my own little house. Like I, but now I'm like,

345
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:44,780
wow, it sounds like Nintendo telling all these people to stop has only shown a spotlight on,

346
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,220
like, there's all these really cool things modders and people are doing to these games that are,

347
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,300
that are making them better in some ways. I mean, I guess it's opinion, but, you know,

348
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,620
I'm curious about it more than anything, to be honest. So anyway. All right, let's move on.

349
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,180
Let's talk about the things that struck our curiosity in our gaming weeks and the types

350
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,260
of games that we have been playing this week. So let me go over to Dark Sakura and ask,

351
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,740
how was your gaming week? I, of course, played Dead by Daylight. I started, well,

352
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:22,300
continued on with my second playthrough of Marvel's Midnight Suns. My, my streaming days

353
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,300
are going to change because of ballet. So I'm actually going to be starting two streams on

354
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,500
Monday and I'm believing one of them is going to be cold to the lamb.

355
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:36,940
Start over and play through the new DLC. I also played world cup soccer for pinball

356
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,740
and I played Beatles because I freaking love it. That game is like a total asshole. And then it's

357
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,860
a gentleman. It's like the one between it's either really nice to you and it suddenly hates you,

358
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:54,220
or it just hates you the whole time. And then you suddenly have a good ball. Like I got denied my

359
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,260
multi ball on my third ball and I was like, excuse me, what? All because I didn't make a ramp.

360
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:07,820
I was like, dang. But, but yeah, and I'm trying to think of something new that I want to,

361
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:15,260
you know, try out. I don't know. I've got a few things that I've acquired recently,

362
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:22,860
but I may, depending on if anyone is able to play with me tonight, I may go back on my

363
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:30,460
adept attempts for DBD. And you know, a lot of people have been asking like lately, you know,

364
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:36,060
has the change to any of the, like the healing or any of that, you know, how do you feel about

365
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,940
and I'm like, honestly, with the way I play, it hasn't changed a thing. It's still the same.

366
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:49,740
So that's it. All right. Also, I just want to add, there's a really good video out there

367
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,500
of how all the metas have changed over the course of the game being out.

368
00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:00,460
And people need to stop bitching. Okay. It used to be a lot worse. All I'll say to that is

369
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,060
Infinite Freddy. The game, I mean, I've played a little bit of Dead by Daylight this week as well,

370
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:12,780
and overall the game's in a decent place. I still think like some killers don't hold up well against

371
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:22,300
others. Um, but also tunneling. My God is just, I have an idea. What do you think about this? And

372
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:28,620
this is just a pie in the sky idea. What do you think that if somebody was the last person hooked

373
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:34,860
and they get picked up again, maybe they get some type of increased wiggle, like their wiggling

374
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,500
becomes stronger because they've been picked up back to back. I don't know. Just a, just a theory,

375
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,740
like a built-in boil over type of thing. I like, I like that as an idea. And of course,

376
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:51,740
my other one for camping was that the hook timer stops when the killer's in a certain

377
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:58,300
distance from the hook. I'd support that too, for sure. So I think that's the one little tweak that

378
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:04,380
would be great. Yeah. But the, like the perk metas seem like they're in a, like, I feel like

379
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,260
there's nothing where it's like people have to take a certain thing anymore. Like, I feel like,

380
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,420
you know, I'm sure some players would disagree with that assessment, but I feel like, again,

381
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,660
like use it comparatively to where the game has been before much better, much better place.

382
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,780
You know, the, the series of perks that I bring in, which is like typically botany knowledge,

383
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:29,980
self-care balanced landing and, um, urban evasion. Nothing really has changed with those

384
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:37,180
over the, since I've started playing survivor last year. Yeah. And they tend to be stable.

385
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,660
They tend to be fair and they're good for me playing like a ninja because of my mouse.

386
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,180
Not to get, not to get too far on DBD. Cause I know not everybody out there plays it,

387
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,660
but I just want to say, you know, cause you know, it is an ongoing game. A lot of people play huge

388
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,860
on Twitch. Um, I really love the perk distortion. I pretty much run it in every build right now

389
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,780
because it suppresses auras for the killers. And there's a lot of killers that run things

390
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,740
to read auras. So basically they can see where you are for a few seconds and distortion kind

391
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:13,740
of suppresses that a certain amount of times in a match. Um, which is nice. Yeah. Um, I,

392
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:20,060
I love that perk, but right now when I'm running solo queue, my favorite build to run is, uh,

393
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:27,260
kindred bond, open-handed distortion. And what that does is that, uh, kindred allows everybody

394
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,540
to see the killer and the other survivors when you're on a hook, but open-handed increases the

395
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:38,860
aura range. So if a killer is proxy camping, you, you see it, you see, and this, this came into play

396
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:46,540
on a match I did on, um, raccoon city with, um, I want to say it was a pig that was very obviously

397
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,100
going around the hallways. Well, sorry, Jamie, I don't pick the killers. It was, uh, that was just

398
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:59,260
patrolling the hallway back and forth, but because of kindred open-handed, my team could see how she

399
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,780
would pace this way, pace that way, pace this way. So the minute she started pacing the other way,

400
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,420
unhook run away the other way she wasn't pacing and it was great. So I love that perk for it.

401
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:16,140
Yeah. Uh, well, my, my whole thing is that it's hard for me to go without my urban

402
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:22,940
and my balance landing because those are because of how I have to play urban is like my bestie and

403
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,780
you wouldn't believe the number of chases I've gotten out of with balance landing.

404
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,940
Oh yeah. Balance landing's great. Or quick rescues.

405
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,180
All right. And that was your DVD update. All right.

406
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,140
Darsakra, do you think we may be one of these days we need to just give in and have a side

407
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,420
to Dead by Daylight show? Well, I've already been thinking about it, but I kind of want to do

408
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,220
one that's in character. Uh, yeah. And I, I always say,

409
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,820
Oh, this show would be a great idea. And then I'm like, Oh, Rob, stop overextending yourself.

410
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,740
Don't commit to anything. Well, I want you to be a character,

411
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,500
but it means you don't have to do it all the time. Okay. That's fine. All right.

412
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:05,580
Yeah. How good is your German accent? Who are you? Oh, Felix. You want me to be

413
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:11,260
Felix? I'm thinking. All right. We'll see. I think it would be a hilarious Dwight.

414
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:18,860
I can't speak German, but I can, if you like. Anyway, uh, Dark Knight asks, isn't there a new

415
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:25,100
killer coming? Uh, if yeah, there's rumors out there. And if DVD stays on its current timetable,

416
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,980
we should know in about three weeks who the next killer is. I'll just say so skip forward

417
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,700
30 seconds. If you don't want to maybe spoiler, but potential spoiler out there, I'm assuming

418
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,620
you already know this Darksakra. The new killer is rumored to be the singularity,

419
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,020
which makes me think a robot type of killer. Maybe,

420
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,540
Oh no, I was thinking maybe a commentary on AI or something.

421
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,820
Singularities have to do with gravitational, uh, anomalies in space when the word singularity

422
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,620
is typically being used. And so my thought is that we have our, an alien.

423
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:07,900
Hmm. I'm not saying like aliens, you know, as in, you know, you know, xenomorphs,

424
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:14,060
but I'm saying something that has like a black hole power or, or some sort of gravitational

425
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:20,220
ability. Um, that would be my thought, uh, Dark Knight in chat says someone said, Megan,

426
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:27,580
I fucking wish like, I talk a lot of shit. I talk a lot of shit about dead by daylight,

427
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:33,660
but if by some grace of God, Megan were to become a killer in the game, like I, that's it. I will

428
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:42,540
become a full-time dead by daylight streamer done. Or should I say period. Well, you know why they

429
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:49,340
won't do Megan? Uh, kids. She appears to be a child. Yeah. Kids. A big reason that they're

430
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:56,540
using the Japanese Sadako and not the stupid, you know, terrible movie Samara for Ringu because she

431
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:03,340
was 19. And they did a grownup Yuichi. Yeah. And on top of that, did you, I might've said this

432
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:09,900
before, but she is the first canonically intersex character in Dead by Daylight. Or a video game,

433
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,780
I think. We'll see. Um, and Steve and Nancy are 18, even though they're in high school and

434
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:20,460
stranger things in DVD canon, they are 18 years old. So yeah. Anyway, let's move on. Sorry,

435
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,580
Loki. I know you're a big fan of dead by daylight, but what do you want to talk about?

436
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:29,100
Oh, I was going to say, if it was going to be the singularity and you're saying robot, the first,

437
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:36,380
the only thing that comes to mind is of course, uh, the oral knots rendition of C-3PO,

438
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,820
who always talks about the singularity, uh, creepy-o. So that would have been hilarious.

439
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,940
Imagining like an, an evil C-3PO killing people. No, we would've got that.

440
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:53,100
There wasn't, there was an evil protocol droid in the old extended universe for Star Wars,

441
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,100
if I remember correctly. May the 4th came and went. That was the perfect opportunity

442
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,820
to say something like that. If that was ever going to be a thing.

443
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,980
And we've passed both revenge days, the revenge of the fifth and the revenge of the sixth.

444
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:10,460
Yes. Yes. So Dark Knight says maybe the Terminator. I, I don't think it's going to be

445
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,380
licensed, but I obviously I'd eat that kind of stuff up to be honest.

446
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:24,940
Terminator was already licensed to, um, uh, but characters, characters get licensed multiple

447
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,180
times. Sometimes it doesn't have to, it depends on the contracts, of course, but like, you know,

448
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,740
the stranger things stuff. Well then they unlicensed it. So, but, uh, Texas Chainsaw

449
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:39,260
Massacre, they've, they've dug their heels in saying that despite the upcoming game for Texas

450
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,300
Chainsaw Massacre, that they're not pulling Leatherface from a DVD. So, but I wish they

451
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,660
playing him and I play it, hang again, playing against him.

452
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
All right. Let's talk about other games.

453
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,060
We'll get, we'll get Dracula and Renfield. That'd be funny. Um,

454
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:01,900
so let's see. I played, of course, a DDR extreme this week. I played not a lot of it,

455
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,140
uh, like 30 minutes because it took me some time to get the cabinet hooked back up.

456
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,940
Um, I was having issues where I wasn't getting any video and that's because I forgot that it

457
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:16,700
goes through a board to do that. And I had it plugged in the wrong spot. So I finally got that

458
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,500
all working and everything works great. And I'm very excited that the cabinet is not broken

459
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:29,980
because that would make me very sad. Um, then of course, uh, lots of Minecraft. So I like really

460
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:35,340
grinded Minecraft this week. I was trying to get my video out this weekend, but I got sidetracked

461
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:42,300
with other things I have to do first. So a part of that is developing a mod. That's going to work

462
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:50,780
with, um, the stuff that we have right now in channel 64 to help bring in the custom 3d models

463
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:57,180
I have for the robot masters themselves. So I finally finished that. I mean, there's about 99%

464
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,300
done today. I it's working at the tweak, some of the models so that they look nicer and everything.

465
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,700
Um, and I got to go commission the rest of those cause I only have the first three done,

466
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,420
but yeah, lots of building. Like I did a ton of building this week. It was

467
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:19,420
just really large builds, three of them. I, I built another giant mega man enemy, which I've

468
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,900
already kind of teased that out there on the internet and stuff. So it's, it's awesome.

469
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,980
Um, and I just need to edit my video now, uh, which is going to be this week. I'm just trying

470
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:36,620
to keep up cause like I'm, I have to keep some base to get done by like, we were targeting only

471
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:43,100
a certain more, like a certain amount of time left in the season. It's still a lot of time,

472
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,380
but I got a lot to, I need to do. Oh, cool. My camera. I was just about to say you had a weird

473
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:55,420
hiccup. Like, uh, I thought it was, uh, um, uh, internet like spike, but I think you might've had

474
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:01,340
a brownout or something. That was weird. No, no, nothing's flashing over here. Weird. Just the

475
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,820
I'll do it. Do we do turn it off, turn it back on again? That's usually the trick. All right.

476
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,340
Um, well, really quick while you're playing with that, let me ask you about this because you're

477
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:20,300
like the, um, Minecraft guy around here. Minecraft legends. I know that just came out. Is that

478
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,220
something I should, you know, be caring about or pass? Like what's, what's the deal with Minecraft

479
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:33,820
legends? Um, it looks interesting. It's like an, and I guess like a more like a real time strategy

480
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:42,860
game, but it's also, um, I don't know. It's, it's not like in the same sense as, um, like a command

481
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:50,460
and conquer or something like that. It's more of like a, um, I don't know. I really don't play a

482
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,740
lot of real time strategy games. Okay. I don't know what's up with the camera. It's the software.

483
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:02,220
It just keeps crashing. So I don't know. I mean, I could just put no background, but no one wants

484
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:11,580
to see that. Um, so basically just, I haven't really played it too much, but you, you build

485
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:17,020
different structures that then allow you to create units and you use those units kind of

486
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,660
like direct them to go do stuff. And as far as like gathering resources, you have your allies

487
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,300
that go and collect resources from a certain area. I don't know. It didn't really seem that

488
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:32,940
interesting to me. And honestly, like the more I saw of it, it's still not very interesting. I

489
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,260
hear it's fun and it's probably worth checking out at least on game pass because it's free.

490
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,540
Well, it's not free. You're paying for game pass, but it's included with game path. So,

491
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,060
you know, it'd be worth checking out for that. Um, is it something that I would play like longterm?

492
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,220
Eh, I don't know. Like I'd be more interested in Minecraft dungeons than it. And I haven't

493
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,460
even played Minecraft dungeons yet. I play a little bit of Minecraft dungeons. I enjoy it.

494
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,380
It's good. Yeah. That looks fun. Um, it's just legends. Like I just don't,

495
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:08,220
I don't know. It seems weird. Like just the, the way it's set up. Like I wish it was more

496
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,540
like a traditional RTS game where it's like, that's why I used to love doing like with

497
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,620
command and conquer red alert is just, I wouldn't even really play. I mean, I would play through all

498
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:22,700
the story missions and stuff, but my most favorite thing doing was just creating skirmish matches

499
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,660
where you just have a random map or you create your own map and then you just put you, okay,

500
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,260
I'm going to have one faction here, one faction here, one faction here. And you just all play

501
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,660
against the AI stuff. And it was a lot of fun. Like I used to do that for hours, but

502
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,220
this, I just, I don't know. Not really interested in it. I don't know why.

503
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,940
Uh, Minecraft dungeons is good. It's, it's basically an ARPG, a very competent one,

504
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,180
uh, that is meant to be played on a controller. It's a, it's a lot of fun. I like it. So yeah.

505
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:59,500
All right. Well, um, if you're all done, uh, then I will go to my gaming week. So my gaming week,

506
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,580
um, let's see, my gaming week was, uh, I played a little more final fantasy one pixel remaster

507
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:12,700
because I actually completed the platinum trophy. So I have now platinum two games on PlayStation

508
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,820
with Diablo three and now final fantasy one pixel remaster. Uh, all I had to do was hunt down a

509
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,660
warmack, which is like a one in 64 spawn in the last dungeon where you get Tiamat. And that was

510
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:29,260
it really, uh, the other things were very easy to pick up. So, um, yeah, that was, that was that.

511
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:35,980
And then pretty much, uh, the majority of my week, otherwise I started playing final fantasy origin

512
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,100
stranger of paradise. That was the other big game I started playing. And, uh, this game has

513
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,900
been interesting. So I I've kind of stayed away from it until it dropped in price. And at some

514
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:51,100
point it finally did come down to 20 bucks. So it's been on sale, I think like permanently or

515
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:56,860
whatever to 40 bucks. And then some places put it on sale, like target, Amazon, et cetera,

516
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,820
for 20 bucks. And I think I mentioned this on the show last week, I picked up the PS4 version

517
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:07,180
because it has a free upgrade to PS5. So I've been playing it a little bit and I am enjoying it. Um,

518
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,460
I like the combat system and how they incorporate the final fantasy jobs into it a lot.

519
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,380
I like that you can flip back and forth between like, Oh, I'm a red mage. Oh,

520
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:23,740
now I'm a Ninja. Like you can do that except you are limited to only two until you stop and you

521
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,860
get to the cubes on a map that you can change it. So it is a little bit limited in what you can do,

522
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:35,820
but, um, you know, I, I understand there are some technical limitations or what have you with that.

523
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:41,260
So, um, that's, that's a bummer. Otherwise, like some of the maps are really cool. And what I didn't

524
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:48,060
realize that this game does is it actually, even though the story is basically an alternate

525
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:55,500
universe type of final fantasy one story, it actually incorporates maps from other final

526
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:02,620
fantasy games. Um, like for example, one of the early areas you go to says, this is like dimension

527
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:08,860
14, where the pirates hang out and dah, dah, dah. And it's because it's, uh, the pirate fight from

528
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,420
final fantasy one, which is in the town of Provoca early on you fight a pirate. Well,

529
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,540
what they did, they took the final fantasy 14, Cistosia dungeon, which was a pirate layer in

530
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:23,500
that game and made it like the map that you go through to get to the pirate that you fought in

531
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,980
Final Fantasy one. And like, there's another map later on that was from Final Fantasy 13,

532
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,460
and it has the weather mechanics. If you've ever played 13, there's that map with the orbs that

533
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,020
turn it from rainy to sunny. So I think that is actually one of the coolest things that final

534
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:42,060
fantasy origins kind of brings to the table is yes, it's a retelling of one, but it incorporates

535
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:48,460
the other games. The story itself is just as ridiculous and over the top as all the trailers

536
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:54,300
made it out to be. Um, it kind of, you kind of notice that maybe some corners were cut on some

537
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:01,660
things they couldn't pull off. Like you talk to NPCs on the map, the main map, you just hit start

538
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,700
talk. And then like all these different NPCs, like, I feel like there's a town mechanic that

539
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,340
was just removed. Uh, for whatever reason, maybe they come and pull it off. I don't know. Also,

540
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:19,500
my biggest annoyance with the game, there's no map. Really? There's no map? Like what year is

541
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:26,060
it? 2023. I can't hit a button and get a map. Give me a break. So, but otherwise overall, I am

542
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:33,420
enjoying the game enough as, you know, transparent as the story may be. And, you know, as tunnely as

543
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,460
some maps might feel, I don't know. I don't get as frustrated with it, but, um, I think I would

544
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:44,460
have maybe thought 70 was too much, but 40 is fine. 20 is better than five, but 40 is fine.

545
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,580
So, um, that's, that's my take on stranger paradise. I saw much more of the game to finish.

546
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:54,060
I've only gotten through like maybe five. I haven't even got the first, I think I'm on the

547
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:59,820
map to get the first crystal, but I've done every side quest off stream. So I'm trying to like

548
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:05,020
stream my gameplay, but I do all the side quests off stream. So yeah, that's, that's been a

549
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,620
change your paradise. All right. Um, we're going to get into some more news and what else is going

550
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:16,860
on in the gaming world this week. So we'll go over to you, Loki. All right. Sounds good. Um,

551
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:26,460
so this week we had, um, some disappointment, red fall, uh, the big first party supposed to be

552
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,780
banger of a game came out. Um, and it was not, not, it was not a good game.

553
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,740
Well, um, I want to point something important now. I'm sorry. I don't mean to cut you off, but

554
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:42,940
in the, in the eyes of critics and the pulse on social media, it doesn't appear to be a good game.

555
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,860
The only reason I'm putting it that way is because I've had people that have come into my chat that

556
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:51,420
are like, red falls fine. Once you get past the first 45 minutes, like it sounds like it might

557
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,460
have a rough introduction, but once you kind of get past the first part of it, like there's some

558
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,380
people that are like, this isn't as bad as people are saying it is. No, it's technical issues. I

559
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,900
think it's actually, it's not so much the story. It's just that the world is empty. A lot of times

560
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:13,820
the AI is bad. The gunplay is bad. The frame rate is bad. Um, it's, it's a lot of things.

561
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,700
It's not just like, well, you know, it's not like a Saint's row. Well, I mean,

562
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:24,620
Saint's row is bad too, but, um, it's, it's not one that's like, you know, subjectively bad. It was

563
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:30,700
just that like tech, it's a, it's a fallout 76, basically. It's, um,

564
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,340
That might be an interesting comparison. You could, you could, well, it's also Bethesda,

565
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:43,500
you could, um, enjoy it, but it's a slog to get through all that stuff to enjoy it really

566
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:51,740
for a $70 game. And the Polish that the studio has been known for in Dishonored and, um,

567
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:57,740
time loop. And, or what was it? Uh, what was the game that they had before that? Death loop? Yeah,

568
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:03,020
that's right. Death loop. Yeah. Um, death loop, you know, that had, those were very polished

569
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:08,620
games. And now this comes out and it's like, not so much. So because of that, you know,

570
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:12,940
Just quickly, some comments from chat. I'm sorry. Uh, DJ Rama S says, most people I know that got

571
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,660
the game, said it's pretty good. Meesh says, I honestly liked it. Questbuster says, as a fan of

572
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,220
Arcane, it was disappointing to see what their reactions in general were. Some streamers did

573
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,620
play it through to the end, if only because they wanted to see where the story went. One of the

574
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:32,300
terms I had heard about the game is that it was aggressively mid, you know, and I wonder, and I,

575
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:37,420
I've kind of seen this take online too. I can't take credit for this, but I feel like I'm getting

576
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:43,500
a sense that people that paid $70 for it, not happy. People that are getting it included with

577
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:50,300
game pass, content. Because they didn't have to pay anything extra for it. And I think I could

578
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,860
see where that is definitely a reality is that, yeah, if you didn't spend 70 bucks on this game,

579
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,660
and it's just part of this monthly thing that's in your budget anyway, you're probably like,

580
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:03,260
oh, this is cool. This is a fun distraction for a little while. Just a thought. Yeah.

581
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:10,860
Of course, you know, folks are kind of upset with how it turned out. And, you know, Phil Spencer,

582
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:16,140
you know, kind of took, you know, responsibility for that and basically said, you know, there's

583
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:22,220
nothing more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community just to kind of watch the

584
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,540
community lose confidence. Be disappointed. I'm disappointed. I'm upset with myself.

585
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,820
Um, you know, basically saying, you know, I think back to the announcement of 60 FPS,

586
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,860
and then we weren't shipping 60 FPS. That was kind of a punch right to the chin

587
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:42,300
a couple weeks ago, and then seeing the game come out and the critical response was not what we

588
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:47,900
wanted. It was disappointing. So I kind of picked myself up and what can we learn? How can we get

589
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:53,980
better? One things that I'll fight is a sort of what we want, or sort of what went wrong.

590
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:59,820
There's clearly a quality and execution of things that we can do. But one thing I will not do is

591
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,620
push against the creative aspirations of our teams. I know a lot of people will say, hey,

592
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:09,260
you've got teams, teams know how to do one kind of thing and just force them to do one kind of thing.

593
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:14,540
Well, yeah, I agree with that. Because, you know, obviously, that's not necessarily bad,

594
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:18,620
you know, sure, you should give the teams the creative freedom to make the type of games that

595
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:23,580
they want. But then again, you should also not force them to make games that they're not used to

596
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:31,900
a, you know, what was it? I can't, I can't, well, let me, why are you sitting on that? Let me just

597
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:38,140
say like the the thing I will credit Phil Spencer with here and big kudos, quite honestly, is that

598
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:44,860
at least he takes responsibility for the issue. He doesn't try to deflect it onto it was this

599
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:50,620
other thing or it was the team or I was, you know, but he takes accountability. And you know what,

600
00:55:50,620 --> 00:56:00,140
I'm gonna be honest, name another US executive that does that in gaming. Nobody, you can't.

601
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:05,900
Japan, you can, you know, we had, of course, Iwata, the infamous pay cut, Miyamoto with the

602
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,260
Wii U underperformed, took a pay cut. That's why people have a lot of respect on Iwata's name and

603
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:16,300
remember him fondly. But I digress, you know, this this is about certainly and you look at a

604
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:23,260
lot of other CEOs running companies over here and it's not it's a lot of refusing to take

605
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:29,020
accountability for anything. Obviously, I'm shining a fucking spotlight laser beam on Bobby

606
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:35,980
Kotek with this, right? Not being able to take accountability. Now that said, like, I get it

607
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:44,460
that he's taking accountability for that. But yeah, there is a but but but not only is the game

608
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:50,460
back, you know, like technically not polished enough, but they knew it because they didn't

609
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:58,060
allow him they embargoed the game reviews until after the game came out. They did not give pre

610
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:04,300
release code out to these publications. So they they tried to control the narrative and not let

611
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:12,060
people know how bad of shape the game was in at launch. Yeah, no, I can say kudos to Phil Spencer

612
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:17,580
for taking accountability. But at the same time, you ultimately allowed this game to go out to the

613
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:24,780
wolves. Like, yes, you have to also be accountable for that. And there's some other you know, a lot

614
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:29,660
of comments about the QA team and chat She-Hulk also with this comment here, which is I think,

615
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:33,740
you know, the approach a lot of people would have She-Hulk 10 and chat says it is in a pre

616
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:39,660
alpha stage game, but in six years 2029, it will be a classic. And you know, Phil Spencer talked

617
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:45,100
a lot in that statement about story and creative freedom and that's not the complaints I'm hearing

618
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,620
about the game. I'm maybe I'm reading the wrong things. I'm not hearing complaints about the story

619
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,180
or what the game is trying to do. I'm hearing complaints about technical.

620
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:01,500
Even the presentation of the story is not great. Because like the way they did it is like, this is

621
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:07,180
once again $70 title, you look at like other games that they've done like Dishonored and whatnot,

622
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:13,900
they've got like real time kind of cutscene type stuff that there's like voice acting and

623
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,700
everything in that their stories that they had here were done kind of like a slideshow.

624
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,660
It's like ridiculous. It's like a slideshow not even like a comic thing. But it's like

625
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,860
it was still frames that they slightly move across the screen and stuff like that. Like,

626
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:33,020
that's not even necessarily like a pre presentation, like a stylized presentation

627
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:39,180
or anything like that. It's just, well, we just didn't want to animate these scenes. And so the

628
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:44,460
cut time, you know, development time, we're just going to put it out like this. Like it just it

629
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:51,660
screams like corners cut. And, and it's not even I wouldn't even blame the QA team this surely the

630
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:56,780
QA team knows about all these issues. It's more of like what they had to prioritize. And they

631
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,260
forced them to get it out when they did. And I mean, we've got a story coming out a little

632
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,660
later on talking about some other future like announcements from Microsoft and stuff. But like,

633
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,220
it almost feels like that that's necessary now because people are like, well, if this is bad,

634
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,620
the other big game this year is starfield. That's also Bethesda and Bethesda games are like,

635
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,700
here's, you know,

636
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:23,900
here's the other thing and that take to go back to she hoax comment about is this a game that can be

637
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:29,340
rescued? Can it be the next Diablo three fantasy 14 destiny and this growing list of games that

638
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:35,580
got fixed after they were released? Can it be this? It could be, but here's my concern she

639
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:41,100
hulk and anybody else out there on these thoughts. Here's my concern. I feel like this game was

640
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:46,540
willingly thrown out to the wolves. I'm not sure I can piece together why yet, but here's the thing

641
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:52,060
is that starfall has been, or has been delayed, or excuse me, starfield has been delayed how many

642
00:59:52,060 --> 01:00:00,700
times other X X-Box titles have been delayed how many times. So I feel like they'll delay. And in

643
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,820
fact, red fall was even delayed at least once. Wasn't it? So I pushed us to the summer a little

644
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:12,140
bit. They're willing to delay games to get it right. But for some reason they didn't do it with

645
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:20,300
this. And I wonder if this was the sacrificial lamb to counter the audience. And, and I think

646
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:26,380
E3VL nails it. They probably needed to release something due to investors. And I actually think

647
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:33,420
that it, I think nail that's the head. I think they had to say, yo, we've got to release something

648
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:38,780
now because otherwise people are going to start unsubscribing from game pass. There's nothing to

649
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:44,380
play on it. Although I think HiFi rush was a great addition, but I get it. You can't let HiFi rush

650
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:48,780
is not going to fund game pass for 12 months, but you know, I get it. There's gotta be these

651
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,980
big releases, but there's a part of me that can't help but feel this was the sacrificial lamb to

652
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:59,660
get people to stop bitching. The Microsoft isn't doing anything. Well, it's not helping that you

653
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:05,740
had these 10 pull titles. So this in Starfield this year, plus also the acquisition of Activision

654
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,700
Blizzard. Well, the Activision Blizzard thing is kind of falling through right now. This isn't very

655
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:17,420
strong. It all's now pinned on Starfield. If that's not strong. But there's, there's Forza,

656
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:23,740
there's Fable, there's Setsuna's Revenge. There's all these games Microsoft's had in the pipeline

657
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:29,900
for a very long time. But like, look at these acquisitions, though, like what, what good has

658
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:36,060
it done? Like, you know, so far, we have our first thing from Bethesda, which has not been strong.

659
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,940
And whereas the studio has been strong in the past, this particular portion of Bethesda. I mean,

660
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,540
I was gonna say HiFi rush was also Bethesda. I would say that was probably the best thing in the

661
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:53,580
first three months of this year. So it was pretty good. Yeah, some you lose some. I'll say I'll say

662
01:01:53,580 --> 01:02:00,060
it was a great argument for game pass. In some ways, as is this. Again, I go back to what I said

663
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,060
before, if you paid 70 bucks for this, you're pretty pissed off probably. But if you got it as

664
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:09,820
a part of game pass, you're not bothered. Yeah, exactly. You're you're you're less bothered by

665
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:14,220
because it's like, well, that's fine. I'll just go play something else that there's tons of things on

666
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:19,580
there. Like, I don't it's Yeah, that certainly helps. It certainly helps with the conversation

667
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:26,060
of all these games being $70 too. I mean, because that game pass was like 15 bucks a month, you know,

668
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:31,980
that's already like a quarter of the year or third year. And then some five months at least,

669
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:38,300
you know that you have here for just the price of one game. I mean, you can definitely play a game

670
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:43,900
within that time. The other thing, of course, you know, along with that, he made comments talking

671
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:48,220
about, you know, because of this, you know, even starfield, you know, being on the platform, he

672
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:52,380
doesn't feel that that's enough to get people that can, you know, basically trade in their PlayStation

673
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:56,700
fives for a series X or S. I mean, who's gonna really trade in their system? I think most people

674
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:02,140
buy a second system. But But yeah, I think it's more of a long game for a lot of these studios

675
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:07,500
that they purchase, you know, once all these titles come out, they'll probably, you know,

676
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,820
build a bolster everything. I mean, not everything is gonna be perfect. Like Redfall to me wasn't

677
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,260
very exciting of a game anyways, leave it even when they were talking about the preview. Yeah,

678
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:19,420
it wasn't really on my radar either. That's why I'm not super bothered by a lot of this. Like,

679
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:25,980
yeah, exactly. Like if starfield's garbage, then yeah, I'll be disappointed if starfield isn't

680
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:31,740
good. But like, I mean, I fully expect we know Bethesda proper to have a certain amount of jank

681
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:37,660
to their games. And that's just, that's the charming part, right? It's charming. Like when

682
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:41,900
it's not like game breaking, like if it's just like, just charming jank.

683
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:47,420
It's community theater. So sometimes some of the some of the bad acting you're inevitably

684
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,860
going to see in community theater is part of the charm, right? It's just like, it's just like,

685
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:57,580
was it Saints Row now? Like, so gearbox has been pushing, you know, volition. Saints Row's got a

686
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:02,620
bunch of updates that are coming out in DLC, that they're seeing that they're fixing the game. And

687
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:09,100
like, I don't even want to look at it anymore. Like it, this game is not even like, it's just

688
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:15,500
bad. Like it's not, it's not stupid jank like it, like the older games were, but it's just,

689
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:21,580
it's bad. It's bad jank. It's not a good jank. Yeah, I get it. All right. Anyway, I think we've

690
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:24,540
talked a lot about that. Let's move on. We have some more stories to get through for tonight.

691
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:30,220
Let's talk about another game that is coming out really soon. It's kind of wild how fast June is

692
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:36,380
creeping up on us with all these releases and it's Final Fantasy XVI. And Final Fantasy XVI

693
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:44,300
apparently has been banned in Saudi Arabia of all places. And why is Final Fantasy XVI being banned

694
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:51,820
in Saudi Arabia? Because apparently it has to do with LGBTQ content. In fact, one tweet went so far

695
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:58,460
as to say there is an explicit gay sex scene in Final Fantasy XVI and that is why it was banned

696
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,700
in Saudi Arabia. I'm going to call that out right now and say that is not the truth.

697
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:10,380
That is not Squares MO. That is not Squares MO. And here's the thing. I think that is a

698
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,860
miss. I don't want to say mistranslation, but I think that's a misunderstanding of the word

699
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:23,100
explicit because I bet Saudi Arabia called it explicit in their review because two men.

700
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:24,940
Yeah, two men pecking.

701
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,100
Is the Final Fantasy VII remake banned there too?

702
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,220
I mean there's cross-dressing.

703
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:40,460
Yeah, it's true. So I believe that maybe the review board in Saudi Arabia called it explicit,

704
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:45,740
but I think we all know that if a guy is giving another guy a hug or saying I love you or

705
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,980
something, that's not explicit. And I'm sorry, this is not going to have two dudes going at

706
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:55,180
it behind the Chocobo stable. That is not what this is, okay?

707
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,500
Are they going to play the Chocobo team now?

708
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:57,900
What's that?

709
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,660
Let's get... You know what? Not that I would ever do Boilesque, but if I did,

710
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,780
that's going to be my song.

711
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:17,100
Mike, do you see what Mike said?

712
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,820
Mike Defton chat called it Choco Back Mountain.

713
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,300
You know what? How many of you in chat? Put one in chat if you

714
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:33,340
would get on the stripper pole to Crazy Chocobo. All right.

715
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,240
Anyway.

716
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:41,980
That depends on the first part. Would I get on a stripper pole?

717
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:46,860
All right. Thank you all for the ones in chat. Thank you. All right. Here's the thing.

718
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:52,300
And here's my serious point with it is that I think there's been a rumor for a little bit

719
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:58,860
now that this game is going to have an openly gay character in it. And so this type of banning makes

720
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:02,380
it seem like, okay, this is just confirmation that yes, we're going to have an openly gay

721
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:08,060
character in the game. No, they're not going to be boating. It's just, there's a guy probably

722
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:13,180
having a love thing for another guy in the game. Cool. I would say it's the first openly gay

723
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,780
character in Final Fantasy because I don't think it's the first gay character in Final Fantasy

724
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:24,220
because you're not going to change my head canon. Fang and Vanille, they were not just sisters,

725
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:29,020
okay, in Final Fantasy 13. All right. Everybody kind of reads differently into it and that's

726
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:35,900
fine. But this will be the first game of openly gay character. However, usually at this point,

727
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:42,300
because I love the Final Fantasy series, I love the fact that this is June and this game is

728
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:47,660
literally releasing Pride Weekend. I just want to say, usually I'd be busting out the confetti

729
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:53,900
cannons and the rainbow flags going, hooray, this is wonderful representation. I'm roadblocked a

730
01:07:53,900 --> 01:08:02,140
little bit because I feel I can't celebrate because whereas they may have done a good thing

731
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:07,740
here, we all know they did a not great thing when it came to racial representation and the response

732
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:15,580
to said thing. And that continues to be an issue. As I've stated on the show before, I believe it's

733
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:21,340
an issue much bigger than just this one game and Yoshi P, but it is an issue and it holds me back

734
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:30,940
from being able to go, yay. Because even though I like to think because I'm an ally, I can't

735
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:36,540
celebrate unless we're all celebrating and we're not all going to be celebrating. So it's a bummer.

736
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:42,380
Well, that's how I feel about folks playing Blizzard games.

737
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:51,180
Well, and everybody also draws their lines in certain places. So that's how I feel about

738
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:58,220
certain social media websites, but it is what it is. SSJ went ahead and met with a very interesting

739
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:03,820
comment saying, doesn't the Saudi public investment fund own part of Square anyways? Not saying that

740
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:08,140
they have a say in the matter, but just interesting to think about. Oh no, very interesting to think

741
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:14,940
about because we've heard about how Saudi investments more and more and more in certain

742
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:20,060
gaming companies and this whole, and there's a whole, I don't want to get too far down this

743
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:25,260
rabbit hole, but I have to just as somebody who is gay and I'm not going to apologize for it

744
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:31,180
on this particular program. Saudi Arabia has also been like, actually, wait, I don't want to

745
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:35,260
misstate this. I don't want to get this wrong. I think it might be another country.

746
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:47,740
There's a country that criminalized LGBTQ in the media this week that then said,

747
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:52,060
oh, but we don't want to discourage gay people from coming here and visiting and spending their

748
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:56,060
tourist dollars. They don't have anything to worry about if they come out here.

749
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:06,620
No, it wasn't Uganda, Rama. Maybe it was Qatar during the World Cup. I feel like it was Saudi

750
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,220
Arabia in the news this week. No, I think you're right. I think it was.

751
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:15,340
Yeah. So I apologize profusely if I am misappropriating that comment, but

752
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:24,860
I'm not able to Google in the moment here. But I just remember seeing it cross my timeline and I

753
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:32,780
was like, if you don't treat us all with respect, you do not have the right to these dollars,

754
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:45,660
period. I think it goes for any factor that you feel strongly enough. And people will

755
01:10:46,860 --> 01:11:01,740
look in judgment at anyone who says they're an ally who does this. If you're an ally to

756
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:09,100
trans people, you won't put money in Harry Potter. If you're an ally to women, you won't put

757
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:20,700
your money into things that have hurt women. If you're an ally to having free human rights all

758
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:25,420
over the world, you won't visit places with those massive human rights violations.

759
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:34,300
Right. SSJ 100 Matt doing the research and finding out apparently Saudi Arabia owns 4.32%

760
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,100
of Square Enix. That is very interesting, actually. And part of this I hadn't considered

761
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,620
before, to be honest, that Saudi Arabia actually has a stake in Square Enix and now is suppressing

762
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:50,700
arguably one of Square Enix's biggest releases of the year in their own country. It's just wild to

763
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,180
me. That's how much they don't like gay stuff. It's just wild.

764
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:59,020
I'm also posting in the chat, but for anyone who wants to look, if you look up

765
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:06,620
the Human Rights Watch website, they have a map of where there's anti-LGBT laws by country.

766
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:15,340
And so I think everyone owes it to themselves and others to be educated on this and make ethical

767
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:15,820
decisions.

768
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:21,980
All right, let's move on to something happier. A follow-up, actually, of something we talked

769
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:25,900
about a few weeks ago, because I remember we were making our own predictions about this story,

770
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:32,380
but now we know what, DarkSakura? Well, we know who is making it into the

771
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:41,260
video game hall of fame, and those are going to be Computer Space, Barbie Fashion Designer,

772
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:47,260
The Last of Us, and Wii Sports. I believe that I named three of those.

773
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,540
I'm trying to go back and find the receipts if I save that document from that episode.

774
01:12:53,740 --> 01:13:01,180
I might have my notes from when I, no, I just have my classic game lists.

775
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:04,140
Yeah, I'd have to go back to that episode. I really should have saved those guesses.

776
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,780
I know I said Barbie, and I know I said Computer Space.

777
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,820
Yeah. But at any rate,

778
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:23,260
these are all games that had absolute influence and notability for what they contributed to

779
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:29,580
video games in popular culture and in general.

780
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:41,100
The first one, of course, being the first commercial video game that was

781
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:48,620
Computer Space. If you think about it, in 1970, there wasn't a video game market.

782
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:55,580
This began it. Barbie Fashion Designer was the first one to target girls.

783
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:05,900
Very gender role oriented, but still. And Last of Us, it stood out for being

784
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:10,620
more than a game. It being a full story experience.

785
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:11,680
Yeah.

786
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:19,740
And of course, Wii Sports was the one that gets everybody playing the game.

787
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,060
Targeted at retirement homes. Just kidding.

788
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:29,580
I mean, but still, it could get children into gaming. It got the elderly into gaming.

789
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:35,900
Because make no mistake, yes, it's physical activity, but it is also gamifying physical

790
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:40,620
activity, which can go a long way. I mean, that's sort of the approach I've been taking to

791
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:47,340
how I'm doing ballet. I set myself these levels to get, you know, it's gratifying to get a score

792
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:52,220
and it's gratifying to find yourself getting better at the game. It's the same thing.

793
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:58,700
And I honestly, well, brava. Those are some good selections.

794
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,780
Yeah, they're good. I seem to remember on my personal list, I'm pretty sure I had Barbie and

795
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:07,420
Wii Sports, but I know for a fact, I did not put computer space on it. And I'm pretty sure

796
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:12,460
I didn't put Last of Us on it because I kind of felt like Last of Us, I felt was a little bit

797
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:17,660
more of the recency bias with the TV show and so forth. But I'm not mad about the pick whatsoever.

798
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:22,140
Like I get it. I totally get it. You know, these are all strong picks. It's just, you know, the

799
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:26,700
short list, I believe had Wizardry on it. I think that was one of the ones that I had selected.

800
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:31,820
But still, it's a very decent, it's hard to be mad at this list for sure.

801
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:37,580
I'm double checking the other ones. Well, yeah, in computer space,

802
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:42,700
one of the important things about that is that their developers went on to establish Atari.

803
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,200
Yeah.

804
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:49,100
Okay, there was also Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, FIFA,

805
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:54,380
GoldenEye 007, NBA 2K, Quake and Wizardry. I think I might have mentioned Quake.

806
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,860
Yeah, I feel like Quake was on my shortlist too, but yeah.

807
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:07,260
But no, I totally agree with this list of winners for the reasons listed. They were all notable.

808
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:14,700
And I do actually completely agree with The Last of Us being on there, because I think it is one

809
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:21,980
of those few games that has pushed the border of entertainment, you know, between how much of this

810
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:27,100
is narrative and how much of this is game and the emotional investment involved. Because I

811
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:32,300
don't think I've talked to a single person who's played it that hasn't gotten somewhat emotional

812
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,420
over parts of the game.

813
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:42,460
Yeah. And I get it. Again, I can't help but feel like the recent success of the HBO show

814
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:49,820
lent itself to that. And how much is that a reflection of the original game, especially

815
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:55,900
compared to some of these other older titles? But at the same time, sure. Obviously the fact

816
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:59,820
that the source material lent itself to be able to make something like that, I get it. I understand

817
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,700
why it's on the shortlist and why ultimately they picked it. Maybe I'm just being an old man saying,

818
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:09,020
but there's older games they should have played. I get it. There's got to be a contemporary title

819
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:14,700
or two to make everybody pay attention. It's so funny because this is the same week as the Rock

820
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:19,420
and Roll Hall of Fame, right? Because we've seen all those posts about Missy Elliott made the

821
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:23,580
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Because if you're not already aware, because they put in Dolly Parton

822
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:29,900
last year, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is really like the Music Hall of Fame. It's not just

823
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:37,420
rock music. It's all music basically. But anyway, I digress. All right. Let's move on to a game that

824
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:43,820
will this, will this end up in the Hall of Fame someday? I don't know. I don't know, Loki.

825
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:56,380
It might, but like, yeah. You know, Dead Game, of course, Pokemon Go hit its lowest revenue in five

826
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:00,780
years. But of course, you know, Niantic isn't confirming that to be the case. Of course,

827
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:08,220
why would they? So according to the market research tool App Magic, they have determined

828
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:15,900
that in the month of April, that the revenue was down to $34.7 million, which is the lowest monthly

829
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:24,060
game revenue since February 2018. But Niantic says nope, nope, nope. In fact, revenues up.

830
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:31,820
Um, I mean, cool. That's still making quite a bit of money. I would like to make

831
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:40,060
$30 million in a month. Deft in chat took the words right out of my mouth. Niantic responding

832
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:47,660
to this so fast and not to the community is hilarious and sad. I actually think I'll take

833
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:51,820
out the word hilarious and just say sad. I understand your usage of it completely

834
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:57,020
Deft, but I just want to focus on the negative here. There's a rare thing on this show. I love

835
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:03,020
games and I try to be very positive about games. And I've been trying to be very positive about

836
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:10,780
this company too. This continues to piss me off and nothing exacerbates it more than this example.

837
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:18,700
They responded to this story within a day. They still have not responded to the community. Fuck

838
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:27,020
off. It's so upsetting. Well, gotta please the shareholders, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Deft says,

839
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,220
believe me, I'm not laughing in a happy way either. No. And I get the way you meant it.

840
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:36,060
Sometimes you have to laugh because you've expended every other emotion.

841
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:41,580
I guess it's sometimes why people laugh at funerals. It's how we process grief.

842
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:51,340
Anyway. Yeah, it's, I mean, obviously, like, I don't believe it. I don't believe that they were

843
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:57,100
up. I think that obviously it's starting to come around. But like, still, it's a lot of money that

844
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:02,460
they're making. Like if one starts getting down to the single digit millions, and let's call it,

845
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:08,460
you know, that they're suffering. But right now, it's like, oh, no, they only made $34 million.

846
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:13,660
I can tell you right now, it's not like they're breaking the bank. They didn't put $34 million

847
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:20,700
worth of development into the game during the month of April. So they're making plenty of money.

848
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:26,940
Like, it's just, I don't know. It's, it's so wild with Niantic. So Niantic's putting out a

849
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:30,700
new game this week. I don't know if y'all know, but that Peridot is finally releasing, at least

850
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,860
in the US. I don't know if it's a global release or just the US, but it's coming out this week. So

851
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:39,660
do with that info what you will. I will say this. I found out they're working on another

852
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:45,420
application and it's, I've been out for a little bit in testing. It's called Truffle. And it's the

853
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:50,860
type of social media, social network they're working on. It's only in beta test in the Austin,

854
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:55,740
Texas area right now, because I believe they soft launched it with South by Southwest in Austin,

855
01:20:55,740 --> 01:21:01,020
Texas. But it's interesting because we remember the words about Niantic purchasing a social

856
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,900
network and what were they doing it for? And it appears it's this, and it's an interesting type of

857
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:14,140
your friends pointing out the cool places in town and the hotspots with these, this app. It sounds

858
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:20,300
interesting. Yeah. It almost sounds like a, a sort of an evolution of sorts of four square.

859
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,540
So I'm curious to get, I can't tell you cause I can't use it. It's only available in Austin right

860
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:29,020
now, but it's interesting to see how Niantic goes in all these other directions. And that's why I

861
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:35,420
feel like again, Niantic on some, on some principle, I don't think it's going to be hurt

862
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:42,220
by the shit they're pulling in Pokemon go and, and the potential revenue being lost, you know,

863
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:47,900
whether it's factor perceived or whatever it is at this point, because they have all these other

864
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,820
things going on that seem like they're really interesting and probably going to be positive,

865
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:57,740
but it's so weird to watch a company like literally leave money at the altar.

866
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:03,660
Or on the table, whatever you want to call it. They're literally leaving money at the table

867
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,780
by doing this. I it's, it's just, I've never seen anything like it in gaming.

868
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:19,900
I mean, yeah, I don't know. They feel it's a, it's a, they feel that it's a gamble. I mean,

869
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:27,020
they just look at the numbers. We can, we can't see their backend data. So to them, you know,

870
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:34,860
yeah, it's, it's a balance between pissing off the fan base and pissing off the people that

871
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:40,860
are paying for these in game purchases. If it doesn't upset the whales, then whatever.

872
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:47,820
I can't see in our chat right now says you could most likely chalk up most of the industry's

873
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:56,220
problems to shareholders and execs. Oh, this show turns 21 next, next month. If there's one lesson,

874
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:02,700
I want you to take from 21 years of orange lounge radio. It's that every, everything that's wrong in

875
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:09,500
this industry is shareholder isn't execs. Every bad decision ever made in gaming was made in a

876
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:15,420
boardroom. It wasn't made by an artist. It wasn't made by a level designer. It wasn't made by a QA

877
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:21,420
tester. It wasn't made by the hardworking people on the front lines. It wasn't made by it. Every

878
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:27,260
bad decision was made in a boardroom. If you could take anything from 21 years of this show,

879
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:38,220
take that. Enjoy. All right. Anyhow, moving on. I think we're over to, oh, me talking about

880
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:43,820
Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. Ah, yes. After all, I have been playing this series a little bit,

881
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:48,460
at least the first game. I kind of got sidetracked from playing the second game, thanks to Stranger

882
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:54,220
of Paradise. But at some point I'll get back to it. Anyway, the sales have been bragged about a

883
01:23:54,220 --> 01:24:00,540
little bit for the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster. They have crossed 2 million units worldwide.

884
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:06,540
That's right. Now that these have been released on more platforms, Square has announced that they

885
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:13,340
have sold over 2 million units worldwide. In a tweet, Final Fantasy wrote, we're delighted

886
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:17,740
to announce we've shipped and digitally sold over 2 million copies of the Final Fantasy

887
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:22,860
Pixel Remaster series across Steam, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and mobile. Thank you all

888
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:26,860
for joining us. If you haven't, now's the perfect time. Yes, yes. Put that in there. Of course,

889
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:33,900
now that doesn't say if it's 2 million from 6, if you bought all 6, does that count as 6 or does

890
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:41,260
that count as 1? Because I bet it counts as 6. But still, not bad numbers for something that was

891
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:47,980
probably a smaller team to make than something like Final Fantasy XVI or, you know,

892
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:53,260
Forespoken or some of Square Enix's other recent releases. So, I'm sure they're feeling pretty

893
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:58,220
good about this number. It's a bummer they couldn't put out more physical copies because

894
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:04,780
there's a lot of people that still want those, can't get them. But anyway, I guess there are

895
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:10,620
other people leaving money on the table, who knew? But congrats on the sales. I hope it encourages

896
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:16,700
the remake of more retro. I hope we get something like this for more retro titles. Chrono Trigger.

897
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:25,900
Hello. It's Square. It's time. Square. Square Enix. It's time. Chrono Trigger. You've had

898
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:30,460
these Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters. You've had Chrono Cross. I realize that's probably not the

899
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:35,580
best example, but you fixed Chrono Cross a year later. You've done Live Alive. You've got that

900
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:45,660
Square. Chrono Trigger. It's time. Do it. Tactics 2, please. Thank you. All right, moving on.

901
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:54,140
Dark Sakura. For a moment, I was making sure that I wasn't muted because I had been munching. But,

902
01:25:54,860 --> 01:26:02,620
you know, there's still that big news censorship issue going on in Russia, especially in regards to

903
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:12,140
their horrid acts against Ukraine. But a Finnish newspaper is doing something about it. The

904
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:17,180
newspaper is called, I am going to butcher this. That's not the name of it, by the way.

905
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:27,020
Helsing and Sonomat, they were bypassing Russia's censorship using Counter-Strike.

906
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:37,180
So, basically, the thing is that while the news outlets are blocked, foreign media and whatnot,

907
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:53,260
online games are not banned. And Counter-Strike is really, really popular in Russia. So, you can

908
01:26:53,900 --> 01:27:02,540
make custom-made maps that anyone can download and use. And so, that is what this paper is pretty

909
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:07,820
much doing. In fact, they unveiled this on World Press Freedom Day, which was this past Wednesday.

910
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:16,060
They have a basement in one of the apartment buildings. And in a hidden room,

911
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:26,380
there are Russian-language reporting by newspaper war correspondents in Ukraine. So,

912
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:34,060
you can actually see what the true documentation is outside of Russia. And it's a digital room

913
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:40,540
lit up by red lights and plastered with news articles and pictures that report on the various

914
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:46,620
events going on. And on one of the walls, players can find a map of Ukraine that shows

915
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:52,460
where there are details on attacks on civilian populations and a Russian-language recording

916
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:59,980
of someone reading the articles allowed playing in the background. And basically,

917
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:08,140
these are escaping Russian propaganda. And then that map has been downloaded over 2,000

918
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:17,740
times though the paper can't track the downloads by geography. But even so, this is...

919
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:25,180
Actually, I'm gonna read this quote from one of the people behind this. This definitely underlines

920
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:29,980
the fact that every attempt to obstruct the flow of information and blind the eyes of the public

921
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:43,580
is doomed to fail in today's world. And this is like the modern equivalent of the air raids that

922
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:51,100
would drop flyers on countries during World War II. It's an awfully clever way to get through

923
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:56,860
that firewall of information. I will say it's fascinating that it's in a video game too,

924
01:28:56,860 --> 01:29:02,140
but pretty cool for gaming because we don't always get associated with the good stories.

925
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:05,980
But this is super clever how they're doing this. The irony that it's in Counter-Strike,

926
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:13,580
which is an anti-terrorism TV team type of thing. And the fact that it's so popular,

927
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:23,020
I think that it has something like over 4 million players in Russia. If even a quarter of people

928
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:31,020
download this map on some kind of whim and then see all of this, they're gonna talk about it.

929
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:35,660
Of course, then we have the counter. How long is it gonna take the Russian government to start

930
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:43,100
noticing as well and shut this down? But at any rate, I'm glad the information is out there.

931
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:50,780
I'm glad that the truth is being known. They haven't shut down podcasts though,

932
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:55,900
because I don't want to shine a spotlight on anyone, but I know in our Discord,

933
01:29:55,900 --> 01:30:02,060
we have somebody over there that participates with this show and is aware of what's going on

934
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:11,100
over there. They're not plugging up all the holes. Well, no, I think that it's impossible to

935
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:17,980
you know, to plug up everything. And on top of that, I wouldn't even be surprised if there are

936
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:29,340
maybe lower level politicians who don't really care for what their country is doing.

937
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,100
And they may have to tow a public line, but I wouldn't doubt that there are

938
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:36,620
sympathetic people who are letting the information come through.

939
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:43,740
Yeah. All right. Well, let's move on. We have some more stories. Let's go to this.

940
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:50,300
Timely with next month being the time when E3 would have happened, but you know.

941
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:58,620
Yes. So Xbox Game Showcase, which is going to be Sunday, June 11th at 10 a.m. Pacific time,

942
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:05,900
which they're going to have a Starfield Direct immediately following the Xbox Game Showcase.

943
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:13,260
More of like, OK, listen, Starfield's not as broken as Redfall. Trust us. You know,

944
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:20,460
we still have time to. So, yeah, I'm curious to see what that's going to look like.

945
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:25,500
Obviously, the Xbox Game Showcase is going to show us more of what the Xbox studios are working on.

946
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:30,140
So hopefully we'll see some more stuff out of that as well. And being that Starfield's got

947
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:40,700
its own direct. Maybe, you know, other things, so. Yeah, apparently also on June 13th,

948
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:47,340
they're going to be airing a Xbox Game Showcase extended and says it's a stream

949
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:55,820
that will host some interviews based off of the game announcements. I'm excited.

950
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:02,140
Yeah. What else from Microsoft Studios would you like to hear more about?

951
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:10,620
Fable. Yeah, that's a new Fallout game or like not necessarily the Fallout, but like

952
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:17,820
whatever was it? Obsidian is working on. Oh, oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. I can't remember

953
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:22,460
the name of the game. There's another game that they're working on. It's another medieval game.

954
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:26,540
Yeah, pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. They showed a preview for it at one point and I

955
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,180
totally can't remember what it was called now, but yes.

956
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:34,140
I would like to see that. I just like to see like it's more of the stuff that we don't know

957
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:40,060
is coming yet. Like, I think that's exciting. I'm still hopeful for Starfield. Like, I'm not,

958
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:44,300
it's Starfield's not something I'm like super excited about, but like, I'm going to check it

959
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:50,460
out. But like, it's I'm just like trying to see what, you know, stuff to anticipate, you know,

960
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:57,260
what new things are out there. I mean, you know, obviously for some other sports is cool. I mean,

961
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:01,660
I'm more excited about whatever the next Horizon game is. That said, I still haven't played the

962
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:06,940
last Horizon game or maybe I did play the last Horizon game. I don't know. Probably still need

963
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:12,780
to play the last Horizon game because Horizon's awesome, but I'm more excited about the Horizon

964
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:20,060
series versus like the mainline sports series. But I mean, I don't know. Let's see what other

965
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:27,260
cool stuff they have coming. All right. I wanted to mention as show 100 Matt in chat says, needless

966
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:32,620
to say that Sunday show role will be written on the fly to accommodate that. As is typical that

967
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:36,620
we've done in year past, usually what we do is we kind of block off the opening of the show to just

968
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:41,340
say, we're going to talk about whatever Microsoft unveiled this morning. So we've, we've done that

969
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:46,220
with the traditional E3 press conference schedule. If you go back a few years, usually we would say,

970
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:50,540
first half of the show, we're going to talk about Microsoft and Sony. Second half of the show,

971
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:53,580
we're talking about Nintendo. So, you know, we'll do something like that with whatever

972
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:58,780
additional press conferences we may get or information dumps that week. So yes,

973
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:02,460
sometimes we have to be a little bit flexible on the fly because we have no idea what they will say

974
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:06,140
because there might be something that blows us away. You never know. Something that didn't

975
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,620
make the show world tonight, but there are continued, it wasn't our discord.

976
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:15,180
Now I'll urge you all to go over to our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

977
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:20,940
But earlier today, there's more rumors going around about Sony's continued partnership with

978
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:26,460
Konami. And we know that the Silent Hill 2 remake is something that's exclusive to PlayStation 5.

979
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:33,980
Apparently those rumors are ramping up that there's also going to be a Metal Gear Solid 3,

980
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:38,220
for some reason, remake. It seems odd to me they're going straight for 3 and not doing the

981
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:43,260
trilogy, but that's what happens with these rumors sometimes is they're weird. That's happening. And

982
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:48,460
then something new in the Castlevania universe is rumored that's going to be a Sony exclusive,

983
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:54,300
a reimagining of Castlevania. Again, take it all with a grain of salt. But the reason why I say

984
01:34:54,300 --> 01:35:00,460
all that is that that could be huge news if a Castlevania game comes out of nowhere. I'm sorry,

985
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:06,060
but that's bigger than almost anything to me because I love that series. I'd be so excited

986
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:12,620
if that happens. Assuming it's not looking like the Xbox 360 games and a little more maybe like

987
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:24,060
the PlayStation Saturn games. All right. If I'm looking for a new game to play, the Xbox app on

988
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:30,300
PC, because that's the thing is you run apps on your PC now, especially Windows 11, you can find

989
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:35,900
games based on accessibility features now. So you can actually go in and look for games on Game Pass

990
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:44,540
based on accessibility types of features. Also, so mean like narrated game menus, a steady camera,

991
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:50,540
volume controls. Those are some examples of things you can sort for in the Xbox app. Also, you could

992
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:56,060
also sort on the how long to beat. So this was already in there because I know you look at some

993
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:00,060
games and they'll show you like the estimation on how long is it to beat and how long is it to fully

994
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:09,660
complete. And you can actually sort on these as well. As an example, Mass Effect 3 says it takes

995
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:15,180
24 and a half hours to beat the main story, but 50 total hours if you want to do everything,

996
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:18,940
including side quests, which sounds about right. That's about how long it took me and I did

997
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:24,300
everything including side quests. So, but that is neat that you can sort for that as well,

998
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:29,820
especially the accessibility features. Very cool for folks that are looking for something new to

999
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:35,580
maybe can't keep track of, oh, this game has this, this game has that, and that stuff.

1000
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:42,140
All right, let's take time now to take a step back in time with this segment.

1001
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:58,460
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1002
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:03,340
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

1003
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:11,260
But it's not just a game because once a month, it's a non-video game. What did you pick for us

1004
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:14,380
this month, DarkSakura? I picked Operation.

1005
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:24,300
Good pick. Because it's got some electronics in it. Yeah, some electronics. Very shocking little

1006
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:37,180
game. Anyway, Operation is a game that originally came out March 27th, 1965 and went through very

1007
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:47,500
few aesthetic changes until I'd say more recently. But it is a, it runs on batteries and it is a game

1008
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:53,420
of physical skill that tests your hand, eye coordination, and fine motor skills.

1009
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:59,820
It was developed, actually, the prototype was invented in 1964 by the University of Illinois'

1010
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:07,020
industrial design student, John Spinello, and then he sold the rights to a toy designer named

1011
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:16,780
Marvin Glass for $500 and the promise of the job. He never got the job. But it was produced by

1012
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:23,900
Milton Bradley in 1965 and is currently produced by Hasbro and the franchise is worth about

1013
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:33,660
$40 million. It is a variant of an older, older game that was popular at fairs. It involved an

1014
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:40,940
electrified wire loop. But this one is an operating table. It's lithographed with this

1015
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:51,340
lightness of a patient who's nicknamed Cavity Sam and has a large red light bulb for the nose and

1016
01:38:52,300 --> 01:39:00,540
no junk. And on the surface are different openings that are labeled with the names and functions for

1017
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:06,940
different ailments that have plastic pieces in there. And then in general, you have to use

1018
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:13,260
tweezers to remove these objects without touching the edge of the cavity opening.

1019
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:23,260
So at any rate, and also one thing I think is absolutely hilarious at the Kaiser doctor's office,

1020
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:29,260
not far from me, there's a giant painting of an operation table in the lobby and I think that's

1021
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:35,660
fantastic. I'll take a picture of it next time I'm there. But anyway, you have two sets of cards

1022
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:42,140
on the game and there's a specialist card that you get at the start of the game and extra cards

1023
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:46,700
are removed from play. The doctor cards are shuffled to make a deck and are placed face down.

1024
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:56,220
The American and Australian versions, you take turns taking a doctor card and the top doctor card

1025
01:39:56,220 --> 01:40:03,820
and then offering a cash payment for removing the object. So the player in control uses a pair of

1026
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:09,660
tweezers that are also referred to as electro probes connected to the board by a wire to remove

1027
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:15,500
the piece without touching the metal edges of the cavity. So if you remove it, then you turn the card

1028
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:21,740
over and the value is what you're paid. A failure will allow you to use your specialist card for

1029
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:28,300
that ailment to remove it for double value. And then if you lose your specialist card or if no

1030
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:33,580
one is holding it, the doctor card is returned to the bottom of the deck. And then the cards

1031
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:43,340
are both types removed from play as soon as the pieces are retrieved. If you draw a

1032
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:50,060
certain doctor card while holding its corresponding specialist card, then you can deliberately fail

1033
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:57,100
the first one and then use the second one for that double value. But the winner is the player

1034
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:05,340
that has the most money after all the pieces have been removed. And it is definitely a challenging

1035
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:14,940
game because these little holes in there are kind of deep. The wishbone to me was probably

1036
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:24,220
one of the harder pieces. The Adam's apple being that it's round is also a fairly difficult one.

1037
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:33,900
I always found the butterflies easy and the rubber band. The charlie horse was also hard.

1038
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:39,260
I thought the rubber band was a monster. Oh, no, thank you. I just have to read this comment.

1039
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:44,860
This is so funny. Bonz006 says, so this game was undercover black market organ harvesting.

1040
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:46,240
Yeah.

1041
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:58,220
Pretty much. But at any rate, the pieces are as follows. There's the Adam's apple,

1042
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:04,300
which is an apple in the throat. And that's $100. There's a broken heart. There's a heart with a

1043
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:11,260
crack on it. That's also $100. The wrenched ankle, which is a wrench in the ankle for $100.

1044
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:18,300
Butterflies in the stomach, which is a butterfly in the stomach, $100. Spare rib, which is two ribs

1045
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:24,700
fused together as one piece for $150. Water on the knee, which is a pail, a little plastic pail

1046
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:33,020
for $150. The funny bone is a cartoonish bone for $200. A charlie horse is a small horse that

1047
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:39,820
rests near the hip joint. I always think of charlie horses as being in the ankle, but never mind.

1048
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:45,900
Ryder's cramp, which is a pencil in the forearm for $200. The ankle bone connected to the knee

1049
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:50,700
bone. That's the rubber band that is stretched between the two pegs. It is the only non-plastic

1050
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:58,780
piece and the challenge where you have to insert it rather than remove it. And it comes from the

1051
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:07,100
song Dem Bones. Anyway, the wishbone, like the chicken wishbone located in the chest for $300.

1052
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:14,940
Brain freeze, which is an ice cream cone in the brain for $600. That was added in 2004 when

1053
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:21,660
Milton Bradley had fans vote on a new piece. And the promotion was called What's Ailing Sam?

1054
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:29,100
And the top prize was a $5,000 shopping spree. The other contenders were tennis elbow and growling

1055
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:34,300
stomach. And then of course the last piece is the bread basket, which is a slice of bread.

1056
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:44,300
It's a very small notch. The notch is removed to make you able to grab it, but it's a

1057
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:50,460
it's a thousand. I honestly, I never thought that one was super hard. It seems to me like some of

1058
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:57,660
the quote easier ones were some of the harder ones. As far as other variations, the very first

1059
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:06,540
variation of this by Hasbro came out in 2009. It was an update called Operation Sound Effects.

1060
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:12,220
It was the only one to remove the buzzer and cards in place of the speaker. And so the game

1061
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:18,300
could announce the pieces to be removed by the player using an audio cue such as twang for the

1062
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:25,020
rubber band and a busy tone for the cell phone. There's a cell phone? But you had to press Sam's

1063
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:30,060
nose after removing the piece. And when all the pieces had been removed and Sam's nose is pressed,

1064
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:35,340
the game plays a victory song. It also will allow you to do standard operation

1065
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:40,780
by sliding the power button to a lightning bolt. There are licensed versions out there,

1066
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:47,340
including a few Spider-Man ones. There's a Fallout version where you operate on Vault Boy.

1067
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:57,580
And the rads alarm is Sam's nose buzzer. In 2020, there was one called Operation Pet Scan,

1068
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:04,060
where you removed objects from a dog's digestive tract. The Dutch version is called Dr. Bibor,

1069
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:11,020
which is translated to Dr. Shakey. That's a better name for the game.

1070
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:21,180
I like that it was included, Dr. Bibor. Plus, I found a rad video in the YouTube-related clips

1071
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:25,900
that say SpongeBob SquarePants Operation Game. Oh, is that legit?

1072
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:32,620
Yeah, I think so, yeah. The funny thing about Operation, this is a great pick, by the way,

1073
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:39,020
Darzaga, and I actually have a recent story about this too, which is wild, is that I went on the

1074
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:49,500
Star Trek cruise a few weeks ago, really, a couple months ago, and they actually did a live on-stage

1075
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:55,660
game of Operation during the variety show. They had a giant oversized operation board,

1076
01:45:55,660 --> 01:46:00,060
and they had the doctor, because Robert Picardo was there, they had the doctor

1077
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:04,060
go against somebody else that was in the audience. And of course, the person in the audience won.

1078
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:10,940
But it cracked me up because it's so obvious. The entertainment company that does the Star

1079
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:15,340
Trek cruise is infamous. The very next week, they do a cruise called the 80s cruise,

1080
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:21,500
and they get a bunch of old 80s bands and the 80s MTV VJs, like Martha Quinn and stuff, go on the

1081
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:27,420
cruise. It's that. It's very obvious that they had an operation thing on the ship for 80s week,

1082
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:33,580
and they were like, how could we use this for Star Trek week? Oh, we'll get the doctor to play.

1083
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:39,980
You know, I'm also looking at Hasbro's website, and in addition to the PET scan,

1084
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:45,900
there's an Operation X-Ray matchup, and there is Operation Junior.

1085
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,700
Zenmonkey11 talking about SpongeBob in chat says he doesn't have organs or bones.

1086
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:59,100
Don't put logic into Milton Bradley's Operation game.

1087
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:01,820
How dare you put logic in the fantasy?

1088
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:02,860
You will not go far.

1089
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:05,020
It does not belong here.

1090
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:11,900
DJ Rama S is asking about the 80s cruise, Kurt Loder. Kurt Loder is more of a 90s icon,

1091
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:19,980
and believe it or not, Kurt Loder is more like 90s. I associate him with the news that,

1092
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:24,380
I know this is terrible, but it is what it is. I associate him with the news that Kurt Cobain

1093
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:29,340
passed away, because remember that was the big thing. It broke, you know, and it's Kurt Loder.

1094
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:35,340
Kurt Loder is like in his late 70s. Not saying that it's too old to cruise, but that man is a

1095
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:41,500
lot older than you think, because he was kind of older on MTV for the average. I mean, the sad part

1096
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:45,580
is he was probably our age when he was on MTV, but that was older than most of the people you

1097
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:51,340
saw on MTV at the time. So Kurt Loder's a little older. Oh, thank you. Rama says he's 78. So Kurt

1098
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:57,180
Loder's a little older. Probably even this, I would say those 80s, like Martha Quinn's

1099
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:04,860
gotta be maybe what, like late or early 60s, late 60s maybe. So, you know.

1100
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:05,820
I love Martha Quinn.

1101
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:13,260
Yeah. Anyway, ZenMonkey11 says, I miss 90s and early 2000s MTV. Don't we all? Don't we all miss

1102
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:18,780
that era when MTV actually played music videos? But the reality is, now we just see music videos

1103
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:25,500
whenever we want on YouTube. So it's interesting. Anyway. All right. Thank you for taking us down

1104
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:33,260
memory lane with the non-video game of the month operation. All right. Let's do some other news

1105
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:38,540
around the gaming industry in a segment we call Rapid Fire News. Loki, you want to start us off?

1106
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:46,780
Yeah. So we have a cool indie game being made, or I should say like, it's not like a deep,

1107
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:55,180
sort of a de-make, but probably an improvement. It is a custom Zelda Game Boy game based off of

1108
01:48:55,180 --> 01:49:05,580
one of the CDI Zelda games. So they've taken that now, the story of that and created a top-down RPG

1109
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:09,180
in the style of a Game Boy. I covered that last week.

1110
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:16,380
Oh, you did? Okay. Yeah. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't done it already.

1111
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:22,940
Um, and then we may have some more casting news regarding the new moral combat movie that's

1112
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:28,780
supposed to be coming out, the new sequel. Um, the rumor is that apparently Carl Urban will be

1113
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:32,220
playing Johnny Cage. What?

1114
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:39,580
It, yeah, I have a hard time picturing that. Like honestly, shaved Carl Urban maybe,

1115
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:43,420
like just like right now in the boys Carl Urban. I don't really see it.

1116
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:48,220
Somebody in Discord, it may have been Tiger Claw. Sorry if I'm misappropriating this comment,

1117
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:52,860
but I believe suggested it could be an older, burnt out Johnny Cage, like an older take on

1118
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:57,500
the character. And considering in the later Mortal Kombat games, Johnny Cage has a kid,

1119
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:03,260
right? Cassie Cage. It may make sense to go that route. Could be interesting.

1120
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:04,060
That makes sense. Yeah.

1121
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:11,260
Multiple people in chat suggesting Carl Urban for Kano, but I believe Kano was in the last movie,

1122
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:21,660
right? You know, though, I honestly, my, my ultimate Carl Urban is as Judge Dredd.

1123
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:26,540
What has he been in lately? I just, I don't know anything outside of Star Trek.

1124
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:30,620
That show. Okay. It's awesome. Got it.

1125
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:37,420
Yeah. Tiger Claw says it here in chat. Thank you. Says I could see a Johnny Cage as an

1126
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:43,420
aging actor who hasn't had a hit movie for some time. Yeah. It's, it's, it could be that take on

1127
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:49,260
Johnny Cage. It's not the, the modern, younger take. And if they want to put in characters like

1128
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:55,740
Cassie Cage and Jackie Briggs, they, they may do some, some aging, a little bit of the characters.

1129
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:58,300
I love Cassie and Jackie and they need to be there.

1130
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:02,220
Yeah. I, I would, I would like to see the more modern characters involved too.

1131
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:05,580
The new Mortal Kombat movie wasn't bad. It was okay.

1132
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:09,980
I never did see it. I'm lame. I still haven't seen the Mario Brothers movie.

1133
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:17,500
I know you need to see D and D. See the Dungeons and Dragons movie. If you're going to go see a

1134
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,940
movie, go see Dungeons and Dragons. I still need to see Guardians of Galaxy 3 that just came out

1135
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:25,980
this week. But like, can I even see D and D anymore in theaters? Yeah, I think so. I mean,

1136
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:31,740
I figured. Let's go. Wait, see Mario or D and D? Both. But are we going to theater hop?

1137
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:35,180
No, we can do D and D. Like, like we're 17.

1138
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:40,780
I think if you choose the two, between the two, I think you'll have more fun seeing D and D. Like,

1139
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:43,500
honestly. I do want to see them both. I like Mario, but like.

1140
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:51,180
I can't see since D and D's on Netflix. It's on digital now. Yeah. That's how fast,

1141
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:54,940
yeah. That's how fast the movies are. Scream 6 is on Paramount Plus already.

1142
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:57,820
That was just out in theaters like six months ago.

1143
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:59,900
Oh, well then there you go. Watch it on Netflix.

1144
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:03,740
I guess so, but I want to watch it again. I can still come to Dark Sakura's house and eat

1145
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:07,980
popcorns. Yes, I have two courses of popping. Okay.

1146
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:15,500
All right. Well, I think it's on like, yeah, because I don't know if it's on demand in the

1147
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:21,580
sense that you can rent it like on demand. It's not like included with your subscription on demand

1148
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:27,420
yet. It's probably still in theaters. I think Mario was dated for the first week of June.

1149
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:30,860
I want to say I saw an early date for digital that was the first week of June.

1150
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:38,300
But yeah, the days of like six months between theaters and those days are gone.

1151
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:45,340
It's mere weeks now. It's pretty wild, but I kind of like it to be honest. Like,

1152
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:50,460
and plus for those people, you know, not everybody is still comfortable going to a movie theater,

1153
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:54,780
masked or not. Not everybody's still comfortable with that. So it, you know, for those folks,

1154
01:52:55,420 --> 01:53:01,500
they don't have to wait that long. It's not too bad. So. All right. Oh, Def says Mario was

1155
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,580
supposed to be on demand this week. Are you kidding me? Well, if I just sit around Twitter

1156
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:10,060
long enough, apparently I'll get a copy from Argentina. Like I thought there was news though

1157
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:16,380
that got delayed because it was doing so well. So they don't want to immediately like cut into their

1158
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:23,420
sales. I think they got pushed back. Zen Monkey 11 in chat says I watch it on VR on a big screen

1159
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:28,140
like I'm in a movie theater. Then I eat Jelly Belly popcorn flavor. It's close to the real

1160
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:35,180
thing. Dude. I used to love those Jelly Belly popcorn jelly beans. Now I don't eat them anymore

1161
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:42,220
because LOL diabetes, but they were good. They were really good. Anyway.

1162
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:47,420
Those are the only kind of jelly beans I can eat because of allergies, but I feel bad about eating

1163
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:52,220
them now because of who they supported. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of Jelly Belly

1164
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:57,100
at all, to be honest. But before all that happened, when I was eating them more, it was

1165
01:53:57,100 --> 01:54:04,300
that and toasted marshmallows by far my favorite flavor, just to be clear. All right. Moving on,

1166
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:11,020
I think Dark Soccer, you have a rapid fire story. I do. Street Fighter 6 comics.

1167
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:17,900
There was something that came out for free comic book day. Of course, the art is being done by

1168
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:24,620
Udon, which has done many, many of the releases for the Street Fighter comics over the years.

1169
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:36,460
But the Street Fighter 6 number zero was out. It had behind it, you know, folks from Capcom,

1170
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:45,340
Genzo Man, Edwin Huang, and Matt Moylan. The first issue, though, did get pushed back and will

1171
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:53,820
release on May 24th with other issues coming afterwards. So it is a lead in that follows Ken

1172
01:54:54,540 --> 01:55:02,460
as he is invited to a mysterious tournament that then endangers his family. And that's why

1173
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:13,900
he apparently is parading around as a displaced person. So in the game. But yeah. But I mean,

1174
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:18,380
and also, you know, for other goodies about it, there's going to be, you know,

1175
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:25,020
a steelbook case and there's new music tracks coming out. And still more talks about a movie.

1176
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:32,940
Good times. I can't wait for Street Fighter 6. I hope it doesn't get lost amongst the other games

1177
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:38,140
for me. I like the demo. I did try the demo, by the way. I loved how you just fight random people

1178
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:46,540
on the street. It was pretty cool. All right. Yeah. I love the time I played it. It was so

1179
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:52,460
much fun. Shane showed up in chat and says I said something wrong. Did I say it was six months ago

1180
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:57,260
that Scream 6 was in theaters? I meant to say weeks, six weeks ago, that these movies are

1181
01:55:57,260 --> 01:56:01,820
turning around fast. He says I said months, but sometimes I feel like he's gaslighting me. All

1182
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:09,180
right. Anyway, let's talk about Xbox Game Pass and some new additions coming to Xbox Game Pass in

1183
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:13,580
early May, which of course we all know Red Fall. We talked about that, but what else do you have

1184
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:18,620
to look forward to on Game Pass? Ravenlock just came out on the 4th and coming out tomorrow is

1185
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:25,580
Weird West Definitive Edition on series X and S. Also Shadowrun Trilogy coming out for PC.

1186
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:31,420
This is, it's already on cloud and console, but now it will be on PC. So that is, if you're

1187
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:35,660
thinking I've already played that on Game Pass, it's now going to be on PC. These are the tactical

1188
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:45,340
RPG Shadowrun games now on PC. Fuga Melodies of Steel 2 will also be out. This is a day

1189
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:51,660
one release and it's a sequel to the first Fuga Melodies of Steel. Some other games that recently

1190
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:57,740
released on Game Pass, Besiege, Quantum Break returned if you weren't already aware, and then

1191
01:56:57,740 --> 01:57:06,460
some download games you can get. LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga now has Luke Starkiller in it.

1192
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:13,020
I don't know if that's something you get free. Is it Luke? Like clone Luke from the books?

1193
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:16,940
Oh, it is the early concept design of Luke Skywalker.

1194
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:22,060
Oh yeah. Cause that was his name during the Blue Harvest days.

1195
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:26,780
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,

1196
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:32,540
some games that you'll be playing a little sooner than Starfield. Loki.

1197
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:40,460
Yes. Darkest Dungeon 2 out on PC this week. Dookapon Kingdom Connect on Nintendo Switch.

1198
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:47,260
Fuga Melodies of Steel 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

1199
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:53,980
and Xbox Series. Marvel's Midnight Suns on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And last but not least,

1200
01:57:54,780 --> 01:58:00,140
Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom Better Not Pirate Edition on Nintendo Switch.

1201
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:05,340
I'm pretty sure that's the DLC for Midnight Suns because the Bloodstorm pack is coming out

1202
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:16,620
as a download character. I think that maybe it, well, no, it's the actual game because it

1203
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:23,420
launched on next gen and stuff. Now it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. But yes, also the

1204
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:30,300
DLC is coming out for the Switch. The DLC is coming out and then they said something about

1205
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:35,660
the Switch version being canceled. What? Oh, it's such a good game and people just weren't

1206
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:41,340
giving it enough of a chance. I'm looking forward to the future Vampire Storm coming in.

1207
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:46,860
Yeah. No Switch version for Marvel's Midnight Suns, which I think was shown at a Nintendo

1208
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:54,380
Direct. Bravo. All right. Well, let's move on and check out what's coming out in Japan. We're

1209
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:59,500
coming off of Golden Week. So what are the big releases this week? Well, on the Nintendo Switch,

1210
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:04,540
nobody wants to go up against The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom because pretty much that is

1211
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:11,100
the release. But like regular edition, collector's edition, there's an amiibo coming out for it.

1212
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:19,340
There's third party covers, ear pod collections, a new front cover, a pouch, a hard case. You name

1213
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:24,300
it, you can get it for Tears of the Kingdom and Zelda. Because as I was referencing earlier in

1214
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:29,420
the show, we talked about it at the top of the show, this is the game that some people drop

1215
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:36,940
everything for. So this is that game's moment. As far as any game willing to release against

1216
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:42,060
this game in Japan, no, nothing on the Switch. Let me check the PlayStation 5 real quick.

1217
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:49,180
No, there's nothing on the PlayStation 5 either. Nobody's willing to touch Zelda this week.

1218
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:53,900
That's it. What about the PS4 if I go back that far? Sorry. I'm just like,

1219
01:59:53,900 --> 02:00:03,100
really? Nobody's releasing anything. No, not even on PS4. Zelda and that's it in Japan. Dark

1220
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:11,340
Soccer. You're gonna like it. That's right. On May 11 for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch, we have

1221
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:22,140
TT Isle of Man Ride on the Edge 3. We have on the 12th on Switch Legend of Zelda Tears of the

1222
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:29,500
Kingdom. And that's it. That is fucking it. Sounds like a lot of stores are gonna make

1223
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:32,700
their money off of Zelda this week and there really doesn't need to be anything else coming

1224
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:40,460
out this week. I'm waiting for Puzzle Bobble. I'm just saying. No. Ooh, she's different. Okay.

1225
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:47,660
I love this baseball's reference there, Dark Knight. Zelda the flamethrower,

1226
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:54,220
merchandising. All right, moving on. We have some more headlines for you and then we'll get to your

1227
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:57,420
calls and your emails. I think we actually have a couple emails tonight, so we'll get to those

1228
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:04,540
and we'll get to your calls over on Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. But first, Loki.

1229
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:11,340
Yes, and a new episode of What Year Is This? We have a brand new Double Dragon game coming out.

1230
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:18,700
What year is this? Double Dragon Gaiden Rise of the Dragons. It is a brand new game

1231
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:28,140
that I guess is a sequel to, or maybe a side story of, developed by Motus Games and it includes,

1232
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:33,340
they have like some roguelite elements to it. There's four different missions you can choose

1233
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:39,260
from that have randomized stage lanes. I'm sorry, hold up, hold up, rewind, backtrack.

1234
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:46,140
You said roguelike in a Double Dragon game? Yes, they have some of that, but then there's also,

1235
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:54,220
there's 13 playable characters. There's a two player co-op mode. They have even a tag team

1236
02:01:54,780 --> 02:02:00,380
like ability so you play as two characters at once type of thing. It looks interesting. It's

1237
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:07,420
coming out on PC, Xbox consoles, PlayStation 4 and 5 and Switch. Don't get me wrong. I love me

1238
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:16,060
a roguelike. I love a Dead Cells. I love a roguelike. Does everything need it? I guess so.

1239
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:19,180
Okay, let's put it this way. I don't think it's necessarily like

1240
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:25,580
roguelike in the sense that you play through different levels that are somewhat randomized

1241
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:34,460
and you have money to unlock upgrades. It's as much roguelike as Ivan Iron Man Stewart's

1242
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:41,180
super off-road. Okay, that game was fucking awesome. If you had called it an Iron Man,

1243
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:46,620
Ivan Stewart super off-roading type of game, then I would have been no questions. 10 out of 10,

1244
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:50,700
no notes. No, I'm just saying it's like they have purchasable upgrades or something like that.

1245
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:57,180
Okay, well that's all right then. So that's the thing. Yeah, it looks cool. It's all done like

1246
02:02:58,060 --> 02:03:05,020
a retro pixel style type thing. I mean, it looks good. So, I'll check it out.

1247
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:07,340
I have to, okay, hold on.

1248
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:14,300
I have to look at this because even I'm thinking, like, Dark Tetsuya in chat says,

1249
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:19,820
oh yeah, I want a new super off-road. And I'm like, fuck yeah. That's the fucking game I want.

1250
02:03:19,820 --> 02:03:24,460
So the first thing I had to look up was, is Ivan Stewart dead? Because I have no idea,

1251
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:28,860
to be quite honest. I'm like, maybe there's a reason we have no more Iron Man Stewart.

1252
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:35,660
I have good news, everyone. Ivan Stewart is 77 years old and is still with us on this earth. So

1253
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:41,100
there could be another Ivan Iron Man Stewart super off-road game. And why we're not getting one,

1254
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:44,380
I don't understand. Because he's sick of that shit.

1255
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:51,340
You know what? And they're still making Madden games even after Madden has left this earth. So

1256
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:56,300
I just, I don't understand. I don't understand why some sports series go on and on and on.

1257
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:59,500
This is this game that never ends. It just goes on and on.

1258
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:04,140
You know Madden fake, he's on somewhere with Elvis on their home planet.

1259
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:09,580
But I'm literally sitting here going, this is a sports game I want every year and I will buy

1260
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:12,300
money every year. Crickets.

1261
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:20,060
Well, I mean, for that you have dirt. I mean, it's rally racing. It's not exactly the same thing,

1262
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:22,140
but I don't know. It's not the same thing.

1263
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:26,780
They had like a, well, they had an off-road Thunder, which is pretty fun. That was a

1264
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:34,940
racing game. It's not the same, but you know, I would take another arcade game.

1265
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:39,340
I bet if I fucking go to a round table pizza, some of them still have a fucking off-road cabinet.

1266
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:47,740
Yep. That hasn't been cleaned underneath since 1993.

1267
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:53,900
The monitor is like as dark as you remember the lights being in the, in the pizza place,

1268
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:57,820
but nope. It's just the monitor that's burnt out because it's from the eighties, you know?

1269
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:06,620
Oh my God. You know, there's, there's kids today listening to this program that have no idea

1270
02:05:06,620 --> 02:05:11,260
what Ivan Ironman Stewart, who, first of all, you don't know who Ivan Ironman Stewart is.

1271
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:16,060
And second of all, you've never played his game. And that's, that's just a goddamn shame.

1272
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:17,420
Let's just make it clear.

1273
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:19,820
I had to explain to someone who Evel Knievel was.

1274
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:24,460
Are you kidding me? SSG100Matt says he has 140 followers on his Twitter.

1275
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:29,580
Rob has more followers than him. Are you, are you sure it's him or is this somebody else?

1276
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:30,540
Like, is there photos?

1277
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,620
Can't be certain anymore.

1278
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:37,100
I know he can't be certain anymore. What's the at? Drop the at.

1279
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:42,460
Hold on. This is important.

1280
02:05:42,460 --> 02:05:46,940
Nope. Yeah. Well.

1281
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:50,060
Okay. Twitter slash Ironman Stewart.

1282
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:58,300
Oh, wow. There's like videos and stuff. Are you kidding me? He has 160 followers?

1283
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:00,060
Are you-

1284
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:00,860
Following him.

1285
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:06,780
I'm following him too. This, this, this is y'all go, go follow Ironman Stewart.

1286
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:15,820
This is an official shout out. I don't understand that his likeness brought us the greatest

1287
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:20,380
pizza arcade video game ever made. And y'all get to give him 160 followers.

1288
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:24,380
This is what's wrong with gamers today. Get off my lawn.

1289
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:28,780
Posting. Why isn't any, why aren't you guys following this guy?

1290
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:34,300
Seriously? I want to know. All right. Oh yeah.

1291
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:39,180
Oh no, please. Oh no. S. Jonah and Matt is checking for any questionable RTs. Oh,

1292
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:45,340
please don't. Oh no. Oh no. I can't. I can't have him having retweeted. You know who from,

1293
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:47,340
Oh God, please, please.

1294
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:48,780
It doesn't appear. I don't-

1295
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:52,380
Please do not have participated in cancelable behavior.

1296
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:55,740
I have an Ironman Stewart. Please let me have this. Let me have

1297
02:06:57,180 --> 02:07:00,780
this vanilla latte fantasy, please. All right.

1298
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:01,980
I'm sitting in the big chair.

1299
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:03,360
All right.

1300
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:07,340
And owls. He has an owl camera.

1301
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:15,020
No, S. Jonah and Matt, legit a concern. I understand. I understand. I get it.

1302
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:20,140
I mean, I don't see anything.

1303
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:23,260
Okay, good. Let's just stop there. Stop digging.

1304
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:29,420
Everybody stop. We agree if there's been no tweets in the past two years,

1305
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:32,140
then everything else is figureoutable.

1306
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:32,940
People change.

1307
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:39,420
People change. People change. People grow. All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

1308
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:43,260
I can't move on from that. We have to worship the legend.

1309
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:44,060
Right?

1310
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:55,180
Hold on. Okay. At any rate, we have more sad closures going on. Sony shut down

1311
02:07:56,060 --> 02:08:00,460
the concrete genie studio Pixel Opus.

1312
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:06,060
They put the announce that it was going to be closing down.

1313
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:14,700
They are- Hold on. I'm trying to- Yeah. They were launched in 2014,

1314
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:16,620
and their first game was Entwined.

1315
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:23,260
And then they put out the announcement that the game was available same day.

1316
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:32,380
And then they put out Concrete Genie, and that was nominated for two BAFTA Game Awards.

1317
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:36,300
And then they were going to be working on something in collaboration with

1318
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:42,220
Sony Pictures Animation, but now it's down. It's gone.

1319
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:49,100
I remember when- That was the year I was at the PlayStation conference on the ground floor.

1320
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:52,380
It was the year they announced Entwined. It was like the first announcement of the night.

1321
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:54,140
And it was like, it's out today.

1322
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:55,420
And they dropped it right there.

1323
02:08:55,420 --> 02:09:02,060
Yeah. I played it when I got home. It was decent. I think it was a $10 game, if I remember right.

1324
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:09,100
It wasn't a premium title, but for a $10 game, it was fine. But that's a bummer.

1325
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:19,660
Yeah. It makes me so angry when the little studios are consumed, or at least they're

1326
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:25,260
you know, conceived. And then all of a sudden, nope, we don't think you're viable anymore,

1327
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:28,860
even though you do really good things and have a lot of good potential.

1328
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:34,140
It's just disgusting. It's all money.

1329
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:43,180
SSJ100Matt, who's on the investigation assignment of Ivan Ironman Stewart for

1330
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:47,980
Cancelable Behavior says, confirmed he's just a cute old man that watches

1331
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:54,060
owls and cuddles with his dog. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for letting us have this.

1332
02:09:54,780 --> 02:10:00,460
Perfect. Perfect. We love retired life of having owls and cuddling your dog. Perfect.

1333
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:01,820
Sounds like a dream. Perfect.

1334
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:03,660
Barn owls.

1335
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:05,040
Right.

1336
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:13,100
Like he even has like camera shot, like the hutch camera where you can see the eggs and everything.

1337
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,180
It's so cute. I love him.

1338
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:18,540
Darth Tetsuya said, I had to refresh and now y'all are following him now.

1339
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:24,060
LOL. Yes, we've we've gotten him up to 165 followers just in the short time we've been

1340
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:29,900
doing this show tonight. I'm just saying the greatest pizza parlor game of all time,

1341
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:35,500
his likeness and every pizza parlor in America and y'all gonna disrespect him with 160 followers.

1342
02:10:37,980 --> 02:10:42,140
How many followers does Perez Hilton have? Just out of curiosity.

1343
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,340
Who cares?

1344
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:48,380
That's my point. All right. Anyway, moving on.

1345
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:54,220
Loki, I think I have to say that there's been some drama going on in the Dead by Daylight community

1346
02:10:54,220 --> 02:11:04,700
around our skull merchant Twitter. And yeah, there's there's a certain streamer has been

1347
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:11,740
going very transphobic against this person. And honestly, I had forgotten that they existed

1348
02:11:11,740 --> 02:11:17,420
and that they followed them until the drama came to light yesterday. I'll tell you about it later.

1349
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:22,700
But it's just like, sort of that thing that I think that we remember people in the background,

1350
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:28,060
and then we sort of stopped thinking about them, you know, and I think retirement might have

1351
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:33,100
removed some relevancy. So I mean, that could be a very big reason why there's less of a following

1352
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:39,260
now that and is likely fan base from, you know, racing, you know, or offroading.

1353
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:45,900
Probably your pre internet people. I'm just thinking about it. I'm trying to think

1354
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:53,020
logically why. No, yeah, I get it. All right. Let's move on. Loki have more unfortunate news

1355
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:55,580
in a similar vein of what dark soccer just talked about. Yeah.

1356
02:11:56,300 --> 02:12:03,900
Yeah, so unity is laying off 8% of its global workforce or approximately 600 employees.

1357
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:12,620
Previously, they laid off about 225 people about a year ago, and another 284 at the start of this

1358
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:19,740
year. So it says, you know, unfortunately, they haven't, they haven't decided to comment on the

1359
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:27,660
issue. And apparently, in a recent interview, John Riccitello said that it's all about setting

1360
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:39,660
ourselves up for higher growth. It's very clear we had too many layers. And I guess, well, he's

1361
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:45,660
talking about like laying off would affect mill management, because they had too many managers or

1362
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:51,980
something like that. Yeah, but not with like 600 people, you know, 600 managers, so I don't know.

1363
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:55,100
All right.

1364
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:59,260
Both the managers and the people that reported to them. Let's do the whole thing.

1365
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:02,700
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why exactly they were,

1366
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:06,860
you know, what it was. And so you're not commenting on it. But lay off suck.

1367
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:11,900
You know, there was a comment in Discord again, I apologize. I don't have it up in front of me.

1368
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:18,700
But somebody had said that could kind of referencing, I think I'm putting a lot of words,

1369
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:21,980
I'm stretching this comment, but basically suggesting, does this mean we're going to be

1370
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:27,180
down to just one game engine, every game is going to be made in one game engine? Because if Unity

1371
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:32,940
were no, no, I don't think unity. No, there's like tons of stuff. There's open source game engines

1372
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:38,140
out there. Godot is one that you know, a lot of people use for different things. There's like

1373
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:43,260
GameMaker stuff, there's, you know, running your own engine on Unreal. I mean, there's lots of

1374
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:49,500
stuff that's out there. It's just, you know, a lot of these different things could be focused on like,

1375
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:53,500
maybe they're not making enough money in certain areas that they wanted to like, for example,

1376
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:58,540
mobile ads, like there's infrastructure that they're building it for certain stuff,

1377
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:03,180
or maybe they're focusing on different areas that they're not necessarily going to focus on anymore.

1378
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:07,180
I mean, I don't know, I've been solely far removed out of unity for a while that like,

1379
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:12,140
I don't really know what's going on at the company over there. But I know there's a lot

1380
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:15,740
of stuff that people didn't like, especially recently. I'm not sure if that all started with

1381
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:21,020
John Riccitello. But like, there's a lot of things that they don't like where unity is going with

1382
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:26,940
stuff. So you know, quest buster has some a plus takes in the chat and says, No way unity is doing

1383
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:31,900
well. It's behind Honkai star rail and Genshin impact among many other games. Yeah, those are

1384
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:36,940
huge games on Twitch right now. And pointing out also this is the I think really the a plus comment

1385
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:43,900
but unity doesn't have Fortnite to fund it. Facts. That is a big, big facts.

1386
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:52,140
Yeah. VX Jason XV Hello Hello says unity epic cry where I don't know if source two is still viable,

1387
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:55,660
but I know it's out there. So yeah, all right. There are other options. Good to know.

1388
02:14:57,180 --> 02:15:03,100
All right. Well options on where to get your news about Zelda tears of the kingdom. You know,

1389
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:07,260
again, this is going to be all over the all over Twitch the day this game is released. That's for

1390
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:10,860
sure everywhere Friday, all these streamers are going to be playing it. But if you want,

1391
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:14,540
you can watch the official Nintendo stream because there is going to be an official

1392
02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:18,860
Nintendo treehouse live showcase just before release. And you know,

1393
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:22,860
Nintendo will be shutting down all of those streams that dare to play this game before

1394
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:29,100
release. Although I don't know how they're going to do that with Europe, because actually Japan

1395
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:33,500
will have at first. So technically streamers in Europe and Japan aren't going to be breaking the

1396
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:39,020
law if they play. I hope they don't do that. That happened with some other game is that they shut

1397
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:42,940
down all these European streamers saying the game's not out yet, but it's like, no, it was

1398
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:50,540
out in Europe. It just wasn't out in the U S yet. So they better be careful. All right. Anyway,

1399
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:58,780
there's going to be an official treehouse stream on May 11th, the day before the game launches.

1400
02:15:58,780 --> 02:16:03,740
There will be a Nintendo treehouse live. That's going to be the game counting down to its release

1401
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:08,940
up to the midnight launch of Legend of Zelda, but I'm assuming that's midnight East coast time.

1402
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:17,500
The stream starts at 9 45 Eastern time. And that's, yeah, gonna, gonna be something you

1403
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:21,820
can watch while you tick down to the game, actually being available and unlocked on your

1404
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:29,020
system. Fun. All right. But look out for spoilers. I would suggest if you do go to

1405
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:33,900
watch that stream, hide the chat, because if I were a troll, I'm not, but if I were,

1406
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:37,980
that would be the number one place I'd go to, to start screaming out spoilers. So hide the

1407
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:44,620
chat if you do go to watch that stream. All right. With that, let's get to the listener round table.

1408
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:49,180
We'd love to hear your comments and feedback. We're going to open up our discord over at

1409
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:52,780
vognetwork.com slash discord. But first I think we actually have a couple of emails

1410
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:58,460
that came in tonight over at participate at orange lounge, radio.com. There's okay.

1411
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:09,260
Yeah, we got some. So going to the first one, if it will open, come on. Thank you. Oh my God.

1412
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:16,540
Okay. Oh, big font. Okay. Hi. It's I can't see from Twitch and discord. The eighties and nineties

1413
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:21,740
TV and mall talk takes me back. As far as the eighties, nineties TV, there should be a database

1414
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:26,860
or guide that lists where these iconic shows are available. Have you seen the night court reboot?

1415
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:33,660
Please spell out your words. People don't like the writing, but it has that eighties, early nineties

1416
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:41,100
sitcom vibe that may either be the laugh tracks or, or, or how they record it. As far as malls,

1417
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:46,380
my area still has a smaller mall, which is always packed as far as the accessibility modes and

1418
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:52,940
sliders. I agree about slugs and snails. Sorry. I just vomited in my mouth a little bit.

1419
02:17:55,020 --> 02:18:04,460
Just the, the mention of them just as, as, as horizon, the whole flip-flop of the review bomb

1420
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:12,140
crowd confuses me to no end. What PS I'm, Oh, I'm a straight white man and I don't like where

1421
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:17,980
the U S is headed. Sorry to get political. As far as cloud gaming, people comparing Stadia

1422
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:21,740
to streaming services and subscriptions, it was more like a storefront steam, et cetera,

1423
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:27,980
in the cloud description, akin to O GPS plus games with gold or even humble bum, dual subscription.

1424
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:34,780
I beg to differ. It was both. You could buy your games. You also had access to free games that

1425
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:41,980
came with your subscription. So it was both. Side note, Luna is a subscription. There have

1426
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:48,940
been people who want the ability to buy games there. My brain, I have to make myself remember

1427
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:55,260
that PPL is people. Also people complain about the series. So why don't they allow Game Pass

1428
02:18:55,260 --> 02:19:01,180
subscribers to play purchased games on X cloud? People also complain about large file sizes,

1429
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:11,340
but we cloud gamers were ahead of the curve. Also Nintendo uses EBITDAS. As far as the classic game

1430
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:16,300
or non-game of the week, I am, am I the only one who thinks that some of these board games

1431
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:19,420
that have been featured mentioned or would make great multiplayer video games,

1432
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:24,060
mainly the ones that have electronic components, moving parts, examples, the Omega virus,

1433
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:29,340
Forbidden Bridge and Crossfire. Anyway, I thought I'd give some general thoughts in the last episode

1434
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:35,340
as well as others that have been rattling around in my head. Cool. Thank you. You covered a lot of

1435
02:19:35,340 --> 02:19:39,020
ground in that email. I'm worried I'm going to miss some points, but I think I caught the new

1436
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:43,900
Night Court reboot, which sadly, no, I haven't watched it, but I've heard as far as like these

1437
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:47,980
reboots of old shows go, I've heard it's one of the better ones. So it's one of those, I'll have

1438
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:54,220
to binge it at some point and catch up on it. What was the other thing I wanted to mention?

1439
02:19:54,220 --> 02:20:00,380
Oh, the Xbox part, because that kind of caught me off guard. He, he said you can't play your

1440
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:08,380
purchased games on xCloud. I thought you could if it was digital, but maybe I am mixing that

1441
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:13,740
up with Game Pass because I do happen to have Game Pass, but you have to have, you know what,

1442
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:19,180
you have to have the rights for cloud streaming. You know what it is? There isn't anything they

1443
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:24,380
don't have the rights for cloud streaming on that isn't on Game Pass because that's how Microsoft's

1444
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:29,100
been doing it. So I think I see the point being made. That's, I never stopped to think about that

1445
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:37,740
though. That is interesting. I, I feel like though, as more and more devices get more cloud

1446
02:20:37,740 --> 02:20:45,900
gaming. And again, I think we are just 5g over the air accessibility, more of that. I think in

1447
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:52,860
about five years, we're going to really see much more cloud gaming through 5g over air, um, to

1448
02:20:52,860 --> 02:21:01,420
revisiting some of those conversations. So anyway, um, I think I hit on all the key points I wanted

1449
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:05,660
to respond to. Oh, I, there was also, I'm sorry, there was one passage in there. He said something

1450
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:10,460
like, uh, he had a political opinion, but I'm, I'm a straight white man and I don't agree with

1451
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:14,700
where this country is headed sometimes. Look, I, I'm not straight and I don't always agree with

1452
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:19,740
everything either. Like this, this country is without getting too political, but it's going

1453
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:26,940
to happen sometimes. There's just so much inaction that's happening as you see people

1454
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:34,300
really rooting themselves in polar opposites. There are certain straight white men who need

1455
02:21:34,300 --> 02:21:41,260
to be removed. Certain ones, yes, but certain ones are fine. Loki's good. Loki can stay.

1456
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:49,900
And I can't see has conducted himself with a wonderful grace and so forth. I don't see how

1457
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:57,420
he's a problem. Um, anyway. And, and I do need to explain. Um, I, I, I had no problem with

1458
02:21:57,420 --> 02:22:03,500
abbreviations in the email, really. It's just my brain, the way I process information. Um,

1459
02:22:04,300 --> 02:22:09,340
I read by the shape of a word, which is how a lot of people read. But for me, if the shape is

1460
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:16,060
not in a logical pattern, it's an autism thing with me. Like I actually literally stop and my

1461
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:22,780
brain has to reset where I am until I get used to it. So this one is to say that's honestly,

1462
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:30,060
that's where 90% of my grammatical problems come from is just that general, the way it looks,

1463
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:32,780
not necessarily the way it is. Does that make sense?

1464
02:22:33,660 --> 02:22:39,020
Yeah. I think of those tests I've seen where it's like the letters are reversed,

1465
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:42,700
but the words the same length and you should still be able to read this. Like I've seen little

1466
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:47,260
things like that. So I understand when you say I look for a word to be a certain length. Like I,

1467
02:22:47,260 --> 02:22:52,060
I've seen weird memes that kind of flex that trait. Yeah.

1468
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:56,780
And that's typically, um, we actually went through this in history of typography

1469
02:22:56,780 --> 02:23:04,060
is that the standard reader, this is why it's not a good idea to have all of your stuff in all,

1470
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:10,220
uh, capital text because of a good reader will read the shape of a word.

1471
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:16,460
Um, whereas a poor reader is going to stop and try to spell out each letter in the word. They're

1472
02:23:16,460 --> 02:23:24,700
not going to see the picture of it. Um, but at the same time, you know, when people have different,

1473
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:30,380
you know, neurological issues, sometimes that doesn't work out in one's favor.

1474
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:35,020
Interesting though, reading something by the shape of the word, I can actually see that

1475
02:23:35,660 --> 02:23:40,300
institute. Yeah, I get that. There's actually a test you can perform that if you take two,

1476
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:46,140
uh, two same phrases, one in capitals, one in lowercase, and then you cut off the midpoint

1477
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:53,500
on every word and then show it from the bottom up or from the halfway point up,

1478
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:57,980
you can still read the words in lowercase. Not so easy in every case.

1479
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:03,100
Interesting. All right. Anyway, there's some, there's a psychology of typography.

1480
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:08,700
Let's see. We've had a typography tangents, uh, Ironman Stewart on Twitter. Uh, what else

1481
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:12,380
this week's episode of OLR going to bring tangent wise. All right.

1482
02:24:12,940 --> 02:24:19,260
Dan got me pizza and it was delicious. Yeah. And I can't see, I understand that, um,

1483
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:22,700
that you're legally blind and that's why, you know, it was perfectly okay.

1484
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:29,820
It's just the way my brain operates and I had to stop and go, what? Okay. But yeah.

1485
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:34,460
I feel like that might be your way of saying, don't take it personally. If I'm like,

1486
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:38,540
why is this word shortened or what have you like, you just need a minute.

1487
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:46,780
I think that to everyone I have to reset. Um, anyway, last email. Um, hi guys, Misha here.

1488
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:51,660
I wanted to do a last minute game of the week for you guys. This week's games include included

1489
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:57,660
on Xbox. I played red fall. Um, now I know many people hate the game, but I can see why,

1490
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:04,860
but I'm having a lot of fun with it. It's your typical, uh, looter shooter type game to me.

1491
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:09,900
It's like back for blood, but with vamps, it may or may not be better with co-op,

1492
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:15,900
but here's the thing I don't like. There is no couch co-op. Like I thought would be like,

1493
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:20,860
I thought it would be, and that's what I was expecting and didn't get. Other than,

1494
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:26,300
other than that, it is a good game for what it is. That's pretty much been my game this

1495
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:29,100
week outside of Nino Cooney on switch. Sincerely, Misha.

1496
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:33,020
Well, thanks Misha. I know you're one of the people that were like red falls,

1497
02:25:33,020 --> 02:25:36,780
not as bad as everyone's saying it is, but that's it. I had no idea about the, uh,

1498
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:40,300
lack of couch co-op. That's really important to a lot of people.

1499
02:25:40,780 --> 02:25:46,140
I also really appreciate how I can't see use the very, very big fun. It made it so

1500
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:51,100
much easier to read. Cause all the other emails are like, I need a microscope.

1501
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:56,940
Well, I think that's just default is I wonder if that can be changed in the reader,

1502
02:25:56,940 --> 02:26:01,340
but I don't know. I don't know to be honest. It can, but it was just like, Oh, font.

1503
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:07,980
Nice. Yeah. Um, no, I mean, I can read down to a four point font, so

1504
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:15,660
Oh, I just need to take off my glasses and get the monocle, but no seriously. Cause, um,

1505
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:20,060
I'm supposed to actually have progressives, but the thing is it because I'm super nearsighted.

1506
02:26:20,060 --> 02:26:24,620
When I take off my glasses, I get super close vision, like microscopic vision. It's so,

1507
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:30,380
but, but without my glasses, I can't see shit. I see blurs and not the band.

1508
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:36,140
Um, Misha and chat says that reminds me, LOL. Is there a way to make the font bigger? Cause I even

1509
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:41,340
have a hard time reading this. The, the quick and dirty way to try is, and it depends on your

1510
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:45,580
browser, but hold the control key and use your scroll wheel to go up and down. Cause that'll

1511
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:49,740
change the font, but that you can have mixed results with that. So do it slowly so you can

1512
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:53,740
revert it back. If you don't like it. I believe it's very similar on a PC to how it is on a Mac

1513
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:58,780
or on a Mac it's command plus to zoom. I think you can control plus to zoom on a PC. That is

1514
02:26:58,780 --> 02:27:04,540
what Jason's actually confirming control equals, which is the same key. I think. Yeah. So yeah,

1515
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:09,660
something to play with. All right. Um, anyhow, that was it for emails, right?

1516
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:17,100
Um, yeah, that's it. All right. Uh, I was surprised that there was more than one.

1517
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:21,820
Yeah. Yeah. I guess me threatening to pull the plug on emails got people to say, Oh,

1518
02:27:21,820 --> 02:27:25,980
nevermind also. So I, I feel bad. I guilted people into it, but at the same time,

1519
02:27:25,980 --> 02:27:30,300
it's been lovely to hear from people in the mailbag. So maybe I don't feel bad. All right.

1520
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:37,340
Participate at orange lounge radio.com. If you would like to say hello, uh, uh, this next week,

1521
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:41,500
uh, we'd love that. I don't see any calls waiting in the green room, which is fine. Cause we're

1522
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:46,460
coming up on about two and a half hours. So I do want to check in though, to see if there are any,

1523
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:51,580
uh, last minute stories from Loki or dark Sakura. There are not. Yeah. I feel like we,

1524
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:55,420
we hit them all this week. There wasn't as many this week as there usually are probably because of

1525
02:27:56,060 --> 02:28:01,020
Japan's golden week. But, um, I'm sure we'll see some more next week. And especially when we start

1526
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:06,060
to get into early June, it's going to ramp up. Then again, I also expect the gaming industry

1527
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:12,060
to be very quiet on Friday. Cause most people. Golden state pinball festival.

1528
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:18,780
I want to check that out. It'd be fun. Is it running on Friday? Cause I can go on Friday.

1529
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:21,260
Friday's Saturday and Sunday. Maybe I'll go on Friday.

1530
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:26,060
I I'm still got work, so I don't know what's going to happen.

1531
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:30,380
Okay. We'll compare notes. All right. I might have, I might have to blow some time.

1532
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:33,900
I also want to go to, um, California extreme if that's happening again,

1533
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:38,380
but watch this happening. I think it's probably going to be the same weekend that I'm

1534
02:28:38,940 --> 02:28:42,620
planning on going somewhere else, which I'm hoping I can finally talk about next week.

1535
02:28:43,740 --> 02:28:47,740
So, and, um, well, and then there's Twitch con coming up.

1536
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:48,940
Yes. Yeah.

1537
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:56,220
Which I, I finally have made enough money from Twitch to pay for my damn ticket.

1538
02:28:56,220 --> 02:28:59,500
Oh, that's great. Wait, are Twitch con tickets available?

1539
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:07,260
Uh, I think so. I saw something about them posting them and then they weren't on the site.

1540
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:08,460
So maybe soon.

1541
02:29:08,460 --> 02:29:14,300
Oh, Ooh. I can't see reminds me that this coming weekend is the next Diablo open beta.

1542
02:29:14,300 --> 02:29:17,180
That's right. Diablo 4 has another open beta this weekend.

1543
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:21,740
I have plans Saturday though. So I don't know how much I'll really get to dive into that.

1544
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:24,700
We'll see. Change your plans then.

1545
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:28,700
I know change my plans for a video game. I mean, I've done it before. All right.

1546
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:37,020
I've been sitting here going, do I take Friday before my birthday off and say it's because of

1547
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:42,300
my birthday, but in my heart, I know it's to play a certain FF16, but we'll see. All right.

1548
02:29:42,300 --> 02:29:43,980
What did I do for my birthday?

1549
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:45,340
You did a subathon.

1550
02:29:45,340 --> 02:29:46,700
I took the whole fucking week off.

1551
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:53,100
I can't, I can't take that much time off. I mean, I can, but I just know like I have

1552
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:56,700
these other things I'm doing that yeah, I'd rather have the time for.

1553
02:29:56,700 --> 02:30:02,380
Yeah. For, for me, things worked out and my work gives us a three days for the Thanksgiving holiday,

1554
02:30:02,380 --> 02:30:05,740
except in my group, we get to take them whenever we want through a certain period of time.

1555
02:30:06,300 --> 02:30:09,580
So I took them off for my birthday and then took a bonus day off. Cause I work a four 10.

1556
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:15,660
That's the show and I'm at is our Google champion tonight saying California extreme is August 19th

1557
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:20,780
through 20th. Excellent. That is a free weekend for me right now. I kind of, I kind of really

1558
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:24,620
want to do it this year. I have, I haven't done it for like fucking 10 years.

1559
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:27,340
I talked to Melody about it. Melody has a room.

1560
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:28,540
Oh yeah.

1561
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:33,260
And I basically were like, you know, I'm going to crash out at some point in your room during

1562
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:37,660
the middle of the day. So yeah. We're going.

1563
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:38,940
Okay. Good times.

1564
02:30:40,300 --> 02:30:40,940
At least a day.

1565
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:47,900
I don't blame you. All right. Final thoughts time. Before I turn it around for final thoughts,

1566
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:51,260
I want to say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was your first

1567
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:56,140
episode or your 959th episode, we appreciate you being here. Thank you so much for being in our

1568
02:30:56,140 --> 02:31:01,100
chat or just listening along with the show on our podcast feed. We appreciate you being here.

1569
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:03,980
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend or two,

1570
02:31:03,980 --> 02:31:06,700
help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1571
02:31:06,700 --> 02:31:10,380
but we need more voices to put out here on air. Definitely need that.

1572
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:15,740
Tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on a

1573
02:31:15,740 --> 02:31:20,460
site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show, that all goes an awful long way

1574
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:24,860
as well. We super appreciate all of that. Okay. With that, let's get final thoughts.

1575
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:29,580
DarkSagra. I almost said Loki, but DarkSagra, you're going to go do your stream. So your

1576
02:31:29,580 --> 02:31:30,060
final thought.

1577
02:31:30,780 --> 02:31:35,500
I am. I don't know if I'm going to do killer, but if enough people pop in and folks want to play

1578
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:39,820
with me, I'd love to open up the lobby and just run a muck in the fog.

1579
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:40,780
A muck, a muck, a muck.

1580
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:42,940
Yep. A muck.

1581
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:44,620
All right. Have fun with a muck.

1582
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:46,540
See y'all later, taters.

1583
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:49,820
See ya. All right. Loki, your final thought tonight?

1584
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:54,220
My final thought is I'm going to be busy. Hopefully you'll see a new episode for me

1585
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:54,940
later this week.

1586
02:31:55,980 --> 02:32:00,940
Awesome. My final thought, two parts. Number one part, I'll be streaming more Stranger

1587
02:32:00,940 --> 02:32:04,940
of Paradise this week, at least probably until I beat it. I might as well see the game through

1588
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:08,780
to completion and I am playing on Bobby. No, I'm not playing on Bobby Black Wolf mode

1589
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:12,700
completely because the game can get even easier than where I'm playing it now, but I'm on

1590
02:32:12,700 --> 02:32:17,020
pretty easy mode to be honest. I'm playing in story mode, but it's good. So I'm hoping

1591
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:20,140
to get through that game this week and then probably I'll go back to the Pixel remasters

1592
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:25,580
if nothing else. But also I just want to make sure I plug Dragon Con. I know I talk about

1593
02:32:25,580 --> 02:32:29,420
it a lot. Bobby talks about it a lot, but it is coming up this Labor Day weekend. Alan

1594
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:33,660
is going for the first time. He's not going as a guest, sadly, and I think he's a little

1595
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:37,580
shy about doing panels that Akani doesn't know very well, but he'll be there. I'll be

1596
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:41,820
there and I will certainly be doing panels, whatever they'll give me, as will Bobby.

1597
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:45,820
I've heard some early, I can't say anything. Maybe I'm already saying too much. I've

1598
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:52,780
heard some early things on what type of panels there might be this year and I'm really

1599
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:56,700
excited. That's all I can say. Of course I'm going to say that though, right? But I

1600
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:03,420
mean it. I really do. All right. Let's see. I think that's it. It's time to wrap up

1601
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:07,020
and get on out of here for the night. Thank you for being here. We'll be back next week,

1602
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:12,380
May 14th, with the latest and greatest. I'm sure plenty of your impressions on

1603
02:33:12,380 --> 02:33:16,700
Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. We're ready to hear them. So enjoy. Happy Zelda Day to those

1604
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:19,660
that celebrate. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next week. Bye.
