00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What does a KFC Double Down and 70 Dollar Games have in common? Both of them exist because people think they're valuable. The Double Down Cross Diablo 4 shenanigans are rumored to be coming back giving you quote unquote free in-game cosmetics while your IRL1s are staying. The saving grace for me is that my closest KFC closed down in April. I was planning on trying out a Double Down for the first time and giving my coat away to a friend. Oops. This is your greasy finger update.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell me more about these and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:23,080
Hi.

4
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,120
Hi, how are you?

5
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm okay.

6
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,280
Yeah.

7
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm a little tired.

8
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,560
I was gonna say, I've been reading on social media your increased ballet activity and this working out you're doing to support that.

9
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,320
It doesn't help that some feline in my house named Midna woke me up by smacking wood blinds around.

10
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,080
That's not nice.

11
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,800
But I got up and is armed a gun show.

12
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,800
Hey, now that should be a point redeemed. All right.

13
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,000
It is a redeem in my channel.

14
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,280
Is it? Okay, that's good.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
Yeah, no, seriously.

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,480
I put it in there for Fixie because Fixie mentioned it, so I put it in there.

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,960
We need to think about point redeems here at VOG Network.

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,920
We used to do the collection plates for the special streams and technically we still, we still, I know we still owe the listeners a foodie.

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm sorry, everybody, but you know, the drama that happened there, we'll, we'll, we'll get on scheduling that.

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:26,040
Maybe it can be a thing for our anniversary because believe it or not, I was just looking at the calendar today and we're less than, we're less than a month away from our 21st anniversary.

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
This show will be old enough to drink.

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,560
That's right.

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,160
You know what that means, Rob?

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,560
What?

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,080
You know what that means?

26
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,440
What?

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,400
We, we might have to do a drunk show revival.

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,160
I, I, I may have a libation or two on the show, but I have to work the next day.

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,480
I can't drink like that anymore though.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:43,840
I know.

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,760
I can't.

32
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,400
Yeah, not the way we used to here.

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Uh, but maybe.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
I mean, just physically, I don't have an actual stomach anymore.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,560
Maybe we can give all of our drinks to the one and only tech master, Loki.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,040
Maybe.

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,400
Maybe.

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,800
Although I don't think you drink much these days anymore either.

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,640
No, not really.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,160
I have to steal Loki's waffles again.

41
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
I did eventually buy you waffles.

42
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,560
Those are some good times.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,000
Um, uh, dark to see in chat.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Uh, I'm, I'm curious if you happen to know what episode number that

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
particular show we keep referencing was, cause I know it's deep within the

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,520
archives, um, it was episode number something, uh, I love this comment from

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,560
Fixie in our chat or fixation gaze to use the legal name, uh, saying a point

48
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,960
redeem for news stories, like picking a topic.

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,440
I love that idea, but to be fair, we, we let people do that for free.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
Uh, if you want to submit topic ideas are like a coffee talk.

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,480
Yeah.

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,400
Our, our discord is always open.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,040
You know, we don't, we don't require the point redeems for that, but I do

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,680
love the idea in theory, but then Fixie goes on to say, uh, Oh wow.

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,040
This show is only a year-ish older than me.

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,880
Okay.

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,040
Now, now you can leave.

58
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,680
Thank you.

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,240
Thank you, but please stop immediately.

60
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,120
I'm just kidding.

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,560
Don't leave.

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,880
Mentally.

63
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,160
I haven't aged at all.

64
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,000
I know.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,360
I know it's, it's so funny.

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,640
Like I'm, you know, around the time that this show turns 21, uh, I will turn 45.

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,680
Uh, so I have a multiple of five birthday coming up, which I guess those are kind

68
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,880
of big deals, I guess, depending on, you know, how you view those types of things.

69
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,200
And you know, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, now that

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm halfway to 50 in this decade, it's like, do I feel older?

71
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,960
It's like, not really like actually, no, you know what it was?

72
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,920
I wrote this on a blue sky or Twitter or one of those this week.

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,200
Okay.

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,040
Here's the thing.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
So there's a, I'm not going to get into politics too much tonight.

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,120
I promise.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,280
However, there is a certain really ugly political candidate who threw their hat in

78
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
the ring for president this week.

79
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,080
And if you think about one of the ugliest people you've ever seen on TV, you'll know

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,280
exactly who I'm talking about.

81
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,360
Here's the wild orange or is it the other one?

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,320
No, they're not orange, but they got married at Disneyland and then never went

83
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,840
again or Disney world, excuse me.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,520
And then never went again.

85
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,640
Apparently, um, that is blasphemous.

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,680
Anyhow, I don't want to get into that, but what I do want to get into is that that

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,640
guy is like six months younger than me.

88
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,440
Here's the thing I said, thank you.

89
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,800
Thank you.

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,520
Like, look, I'm humble.

91
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,640
I try not to have a gigantic ego.

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,680
I know people joke about it, but I try to be humble and everything, but I know, I

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,240
know I'm way better looking than that guy, but here it is.

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,800
Here's my seat.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm going to tell you, here's my secret and dark soccer.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,560
I know you share the secret.

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,240
Do you know what the secret is to staying young and good looking?

98
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,240
I'll be a deuce bag.

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,920
Support trans rights.

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,240
That's, that's it.

101
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,560
That's it.

102
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
If you support, I thought mine was spite.

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,880
No, if you support trans rights, it will keep you young and good looking.

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,640
If you don't, then you're going to look like, you know, who?

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Her.

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,880
That one, that person that shall not be named.

107
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,000
So there it is.

108
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,280
Hushido.

109
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,400
All right.

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,360
Except to have a friend named Hushido, so nevermind.

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,440
Anyway, all right.

112
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,080
I promise.

113
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
I also, I also think spite though, does help.

114
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,680
Yes.

115
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
Spite, spite helps a little bit.

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,280
Um, anyway, and there's this whole talk on social media about pride month, and

117
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,640
there are certain people on Twitter who are always hating, who took this pride

118
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,720
month and they turned it into a graphic where as it goes down, pride month,

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,200
pride month, and then in the bottom, it says demon in rainbow.

120
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,400
And I'm like, they really thought they owned us with that graphic, but never

121
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,160
have I wanted a t-shirt more than the big demon energy that pride month brings us.

122
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,360
I'm going to make it.

123
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,280
Just you wait.

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
I will make that.

125
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Just be careful because I believe there may actually be a, um, trans artist who's

126
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
claiming that they actually came up with that idea first.

127
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,200
So I, but, but take, take a look on social media and find out or put your own twist

128
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,440
on it.

129
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
I'll do it in another language.

130
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,520
Ah, there you go.

131
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,040
All right.

132
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,800
That works.

133
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,800
Um, anyway, uh, let's get to the show.

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,200
We're going to get to some of those, uh, big announcements from the PlayStation

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,560
showcase this week, but first we actually have a special message.

136
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,800
I mentioned, uh, Bobby Black Wolf was not here at the voice of geeks network

137
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,280
tonight because he is currently out in Minneapolis at the summer games done

138
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,760
quick.

139
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
I almost wanted to say convention, but it's not really convention.

140
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,880
It's, you know, charity fundraiser that's con adjacent, but the way it was also

141
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,040
explained to me is that it's very much like a cruise, but not floating in the

142
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,920
water because it's, you know, that week of programming that apparently there's

143
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,200
excursions for people wanting to go into downtown Minneapolis and all this stuff.

144
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,720
So, yeah.

145
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,600
So anyway, we have a special video message from the one and only Bobby

146
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Black Wolf, uh, filmed earlier today, live in Minneapolis going to give us a

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,760
little look behind the scenes.

148
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,960
Sorry to my cohost.

149
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,600
You're not going to hear this as it plays, but we'll summarize this on the

150
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,120
other side.

151
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,800
So let's turn it over to Bobby Black Wolf at summer games done quick.

152
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
Hello, orange launch radio, Bobby Black Wolf here.

153
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,400
Sorry.

154
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,440
I couldn't be there tonight.

155
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,760
Sorry.

156
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,160
I allowed you to actually start on time, but I am at summer games done quick 20,

157
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,600
23 in beautiful downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota.

158
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,680
I am once again, hosting in person, one of the 22 hosts really looking forward

159
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,280
to it, but I wanted to give you a little bit of a taste, a look of what it looks

160
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,880
like here at, uh, it's kind of a convention, but not really, but this week

161
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,120
long event, uh, some of the arcade machines have already gotten in.

162
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
There's going to be more arcade machines loaded in today and tomorrow.

163
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,640
Uh, so when, if you tune into my show, the Bobby Black Wolf show next week, you

164
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,560
will see more of what things look like as the week progresses.

165
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
They're still kind of in the setup mode.

166
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,320
Now, if you want to catch me on the air, I am going to be working on Monday

167
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,200
morning at around 11 AM Eastern, 8 AM Pacific alien swarm attack on Titan two

168
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,640
and crisis core final fantasy seven reunion.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,640
And then Tuesday night at around 11 PM Eastern 8 PM Pacific, I'm going to be

170
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,400
hosting for silent Hill, home, poor and signal us.

171
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,920
Now you've probably never heard of silent Hill home poor.

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
You've heard of homecoming and downpour.

173
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
Well, silent Hill downpour has.

174
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,880
No skippable cut scenes, unskippable cut scenes.

175
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,880
So they play silent Hill homecoming during the cut scenes of downpour, and

176
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,400
they can actually finish homecoming twice during the unskippable cut scenes of

177
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,320
downpour, so that's going to be a lot of fun.

178
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,160
Uh, so check them out over at games done quick.com or over at

179
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,840

180
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Uh, so, uh, get, get some donations in if you are able, but if not, at least enjoy

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,680
the marathon, I'll let you get back to orange lounge radio now.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,240
All right.

183
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,960
Thank you so much, Bobby black Wolf for that report from Minneapolis where

184
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,640
summer games done quick is going on.

185
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,800
Now I'm actually told, and he did say that I could repeat this.

186
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,240
So when I first saw the video and you could see, I'm sorry to the podcast

187
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,200
listeners, you can't see the visuals, but he was actually showing the arcade there.

188
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
And there was lots of great machines there and folks in chat are noticing

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,640
that as well.

190
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,920
Uh, the tiger class has the F zero X run in the background.

191
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

192
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,360
That's the actual speeder on those playing behind Bobby.

193
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,920
But, um, you could actually see some of those arcade machines.

194
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,560
I saw like a UB there's a DDR machine, but it was really spaced out.

195
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,680
And I was like, wow.

196
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,680
Are they still doing the COVID spacing that they were doing last year?

197
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Even, you know, now I know they are taking still a lot of COVID precautions.

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,560
Like everybody in that audience who was not on stage was still masked.

199
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
So that's, that's great that they're still, you know, taking those types of

200
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,280
precautions, but I was a little surprised they didn't fill in the room more.

201
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,440
However, what I'm told, and I am allowed to repeat this, apparently there's an

202
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,440
anime convention going on across the street at a convention center and all of

203
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,800
the machines are there.

204
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,960
So as the anime convention finishes, they will then relocate over to summer

205
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,880
games done quick.

206
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,440
So what you saw in the video was really only about a quarter of what they plan

207
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,920
on having there at summer games done quick, but you know, it's not really all

208
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,880
about the arcade there on site because obviously all of us are participating on

209
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,200
the internet and so forth, watching the various speed runs.

210
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,840
I noticed there, we got to see that first Sonic run of the day was being played

211
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,880
there and you could see kind of what that looked like there in studio.

212
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,760
So that was really cool.

213
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
So thanks very much.

214
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,240
DJ Rama S says, what anime con?

215
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,160
Anime Minneapolis?

216
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,880
I guess, I don't know, but it's, he said it's at a convention center across the

217
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,280
street.

218
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
So yeah.

219
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,440
Dark Tetsuya says, I did spot the theater at the arcade.

220
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
Heck yeah, I saw that too.

221
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,480
That's awesome.

222
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,080
As J-100 Matt says, GDQ is a nerd bucket list thing to attend in person.

223
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,960
Yeah, I think it would be a lot of fun as well.

224
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,760
It's kind of a bummer.

225
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,240
They seem to always do it at East Coast sites.

226
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,800
I'd love if there was like a Vegas one or something was a little closer to our side,

227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,000
but it is what it is.

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,640
I'd still love to get to one someday.

229
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,920
Maybe not the whole week, but a few days just to enjoy it.

230
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,280
And you know, cause I know that they apparently still do panels.

231
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't know if they're doing them this year.

232
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,400
I would assume they are, you know, some of those types of things as well.

233
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,160
So, but again, you can participate from the comfort of your own home.

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,520
You just head on over to their channel over at Games Done Quick.

235
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,840
And again, Bobby will be on the stream doing some announcing tomorrow morning

236
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,360
and Tuesday morning, as he mentioned there in the message.

237
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,080
So break a leg, Bobby Black Wolf.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,400
And if the convention does not break 3 million, then break the other leg as

239
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,720
well.

240
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,400
No, I'm just kidding.

241
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,480
Every dollar raised is incredible for Doctors Without Borders.

242
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,000
All right.

243
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Also, I do want to mention Bobby Black Wolf will be back next week to talk all

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,200
about that because Bobby and us here at OLR, we do tape live every Sunday night.

245
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,760
We are at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby

246
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,640
Black Wolf show at eight o'clock Eastern, five o'clock Pacific here at the

247
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,360
Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

248
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,480
That's V-O-G Network.

249
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,520
And of course, you can chat along with us and our show just like folks are in our

250
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,240
chat tonight.

251
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,200
All right, moving on with gaming topics that happened throughout the week, we're

252
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,520
going to get caught up on some of the news we missed last week, but there was a

253
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,560
pretty big bombshell, I guess, drop this week on us, a little bit of a surprise

254
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,440
announcement of sorts.

255
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,760
I don't know.

256
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,440
I thought it was kind of a surprise.

257
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,560
It caught me off guard a little bit, but PlayStation announced one of their state

258
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,040
of play announcements for Thursday, and they actually announced quite a bit of

259
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,480
stuff here.

260
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm going to ask Loki to give us the rundown here in just a moment, but I mean,

261
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,440
they even talked about new hardware, kind of, kind of, so we'll talk.

262
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,040
Yeah, yeah, kind of, big, yeah, but we'll talk a little bit about that, but, you

263
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,720
know, that was essentially, I mean, I don't know if that's their E3 replacement

264
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,960
presentation, but it very well could have been, although rumor is on social media,

265
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,760
this is however much you want to invest on social media rumors or not, take it or

266
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,920
leave it, that they are planning another one for later in the summer.

267
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,880
I would assume, I would say it would make sense to see something else July or

268
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,200
August, but this is probably what we're getting in lieu of the early June E3

269
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,720
timeframe announcements, but anything can happen.

270
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,520
Anything's possible.

271
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,080
It's still...

272
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh, but how about just, you know, E3 into the sun and rebrand it?

273
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,600
Well, I mean, some would consider Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest is that, and

274
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,520
I would assume Sony will probably drop a couple things at Summer Game Fest as

275
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,320
well, I think, I think that's probably a guarantee.

276
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,400
So there's still more to come, but we got a lot out of this.

277
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
Loki, walk us through some of the big announcements here.

278
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,640
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of big announcements at the, well, it wasn't

279
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,760
really a state of play, it was a PlayStation Showcase.

280
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,640
Oh, excuse me, pick, pick a fucking name and stick with it, y'all.

281
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,480
Pick a name.

282
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, it's more of the, the different state of plays are a little bit shorter,

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,440
whereas like the Showcase is like a much longer thing.

284
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,040
Like the last time they did one was back in 2021.

285
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,840
So things that they show.

286
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,160
So it was an E3 replacement then, if they're calling it a showcase.

287
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,520
Yeah, yeah, basically.

288
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,280
So they had lots of game trailers and announcements, some brand

289
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,920
new kind of live surface games.

290
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,000
So we had fair game or yes, it's fair games with a dollar sign.

291
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,240
It was, I guess, because punctuation makes everything more hardcore.

292
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,000
Excuse me, hardcore exclamation point.

293
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,560
It's OK. The dollar sign is to represent all the microtransactions, right?

294
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,920
You want to be punctual with your punctuation?

295
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,280
Yeah, I'm sure it's I'm sure the dollar signs just represent

296
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,200
all the microtransactions in the game.

297
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,000
But apparently it's about, I guess, groups of people who are robbing

298
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,200
some sort of corporation or like industrial thing or something like that.

299
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,080
It's just, I don't know, neat, neat looking.

300
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,600
It's going to be coming out on PlayStation five and PC.

301
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,960
We had a was this the game from Jade Raymond Studio?

302
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,960
I think I think that was the other big deal around.

303
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,800
This was this was the Jade Raymond Studio game.

304
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,120
Was it? I don't know.

305
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,920
I believe so.

306
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,440
What studio was it? It was.

307
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,960
Yeah, it is Haven Studios.

308
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,880
Yep. OK, so that's that's the other reason

309
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,600
this is kind of bumped up, because, you know, her influence

310
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
has a lot of clout in the industry.

311
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,360
So people are very curious what she's been up to since

312
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,840
she came and went from Stadia.

313
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,240
I don't think she ended up doing anything at Stadia, honestly,

314
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,800
but I don't blame her the way that whole ship sailed.

315
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,520
So, yeah, good for her.

316
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,800
Sorry, you know, all the Stadia shade is directed at a Mr.

317
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,360
Phil Harrison. That's it.

318
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,120
Mm hmm. Anyway, bring in the Shadia. Yeah.

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,120
So what else we had?

320
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,360
I think there's some additional shooter games that they had as well.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Helldivers two look pretty cool.

322
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,280
That's not a shooter, though.

323
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,600
That's a top down third person.

324
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,680
Well, I guess it's still a third person shooter,

325
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,360
but I guess this one is.

326
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,960
Yeah, it's going to be a third person shooter, whereas the original was

327
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
like a top down shooter.

328
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
So it looks a little bit different.

329
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,800
I thought it looked kind of cool, actually.

330
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,120
I never played the original.

331
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,120
What else? So Ghostrunner two looked pretty awesome.

332
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,160
So it took the kind of like wall running and like futuristic cyberpunk

333
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,160
swordplay from the original game

334
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,240
and added a motorcycle because that is just awesome.

335
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,880
You know, I love the idea of riding a motorcycle

336
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,760
down a giant like cyberpunk building.

337
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,400
And apparently it's something you can do in the game.

338
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
So looks cool.

339
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,520
So it's now a Biden ghost writer.

340
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,160
Kind of a little bit, a little, a little bit,

341
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,400
a little bit of spirit of vengeance and heads being on fire. Right.

342
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,280
What else? So we have it.

343
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Immortals of Avium,

344
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,680
which is a first person wizard combat game, look kind of neat.

345
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Yeah, I have to say, as much as I'm concerned, because this game is an EA game

346
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
and that means it's going to be,

347
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,600
you know, loot box, microtransaction city and all that stuff.

348
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,520
I have to say this game gives me big hex and vibes.

349
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,640
And I am kind of here for that.

350
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Like, I'm going to give EA.

351
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,760
We can't hear you.

352
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

353
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,920
I accidentally brushed the mic and muted myself.

354
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,520
It's giving me big hex and vibes.

355
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,080
So please do not let me down EA.

356
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,280
Leaving you speechless.

357
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,240
Yeah. Yes, exactly that.

358
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
Sigh. Can I not have audio problems tonight?

359
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,360
I take one week, one week.

360
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,560
And it all breaks.

361
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,080
Well, it's been Phantom Blade zero.

362
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
It's a third person action game.

363
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,080
That's kind of along the lines of like Ghost of Tsushima.

364
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,920
And let's see what else.

365
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,000
This one's pretty cool.

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,280
So there is a game called Sword of the Sea.

367
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,080
It's like a it has definitely journey vibes

368
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,760
because I guess it's from the former team that did Journey.

369
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,840
Pathless and Abzu.

370
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,400
And it looks pretty awesome as you like skating on this like hovers

371
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,720
surfboard thing over the sands and stuff like that

372
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,920
through half pipes and stuff like that, and even have like dolphins

373
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,680
flying through the air.

374
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,600
So OK, crazy visuals.

375
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,840
I definitely see the Journey vibes from this whole thing.

376
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,960
So but it's not the same studio, right?

377
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,200
It's just some of the same talent that the developers that worked on the game.

378
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,400
OK. You know, honestly, that that's a pretty strong resume.

379
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,600
That's enough for me to check it out.

380
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,480
It does look really pretty.

381
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,040
And it's cool because the thing that you're surfing on is your sword.

382
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,680
So well, it looks a lot like the Journey scarf, to be honest.

383
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,120
There's I feel like there's a lot in common.

384
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,240
Wouldn't it be would it be neat if it was like in the same universe or something?

385
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,800
I mean, not not that every game has to be like a direct sequel

386
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
or influence to something else, but it certainly looks similar.

387
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,240
I love it when there's like a little tie in at the end, like, you know,

388
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,280
spoiler alert, but like at the end of Final Destination 5,

389
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,640
they're boarding the flight from the original movie twist.

390
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,480
You know, it's just it's it's fun. I don't know, whatever.

391
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,480
I haven't seen any of those movies.

392
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,400
They're they're disgusting, but I get forced to watch them anyway.

393
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
I used to watch them all the time, and then they stopped after

394
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,120
I don't remember how many sequels.

395
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,280
All right. Anyway,

396
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,280
the Talos Principle two looks pretty awesome.

397
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,120
One that was one of those games.

398
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,880
I think I have it in my library, but I need to check it out.

399
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,920
But puzzle first person shooter game looks pretty awesome.

400
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,640
Niva, which is from the folks that did

401
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,360
Gris sequel to Greece, Greece.

402
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Yeah. And that's supposed to be coming out next year.

403
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,840
I don't know much about this game, Dark Soccer.

404
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,160
What what what's Gris?

405
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,720
It's a puzzle game where about a girl battling her depression.

406
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,160
Oh, wow. I feel like now that you bring that up, I feel like I like

407
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,360
saw that, but I don't think I ever played it, but that's OK.

408
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,440
But I'm here for the giant antler wolf, so, you know.

409
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,040
Of course. I mean, this is the same system that runs The Last Guardian.

410
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,320
So, you know, good times.

411
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Yeah, it looks very pretty.

412
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,440
We had Cat Quest, Pirates of Perobeen.

413
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,000
The Perobeen, the get out.

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,040
It's really called the Perobeen.

415
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,600
Yes. So Cat Quest, Pirates of the Perobeen.

416
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,360
Why would anyone be surprised?

417
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,360
Honestly, go off like if you're going to do it,

418
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,600
if you're going to do something like Cat Quest, go big like just do it.

419
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,400
I love it. That's like pretty sweet.

420
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,760
And then there's this one from Square Enix.

421
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,200
It's an it's another live service game from Square Enix.

422
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,440
Oh, is it totally going to fail?

423
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,360
But so it's a game that people are comparing it to like Splatoon.

424
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,080
Yeah, this is just basically Splatoon on the PS5, and I'm totally here for it.

425
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm sorry. It's called Foam Stars.

426
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,320
And you like shoot foam everywhere and do things with foam

427
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
and all that kind of stuff.

428
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,120
And it's got

429
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,120
TV anime people in it and not ska music, but that's OK.

430
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,920
It's not ink. It's it's foam.

431
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,480
It's a dark sakura.

432
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,480
That's exactly how the pitch went in my mind.

433
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,360
It's one of those foam parties that I guess are big and like, you know.

434
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,800
Let's just put it this way, though.

435
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Nobody jumps off and, you know, breaks their leg or something.

436
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,480
Square Enix has a track record with live service games.

437
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,920
That is not good. Yeah, that's that's fair.

438
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,760
I will say this.

439
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,000
And look, I'm not I'm not here to like say Splatoon is bad or anything.

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,080
Of course it's not.

441
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,880
But how many times have you played a Nintendo title and gone like, man,

442
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,840
this would be even better if it like had the PlayStation

443
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,360
or Xbox series kind of power behind it.

444
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,360
And now that's kind of like what they're doing with this.

445
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,960
But yes, there's there's every right to be concerned

446
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,720
that there's going to be, you know, microtransaction hell

447
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,600
or it's going to be a little bit, you know, wonkier than, you know, Splatoon.

448
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,560
You know, Nintendo does put a lot of time into the quality of their games

449
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,360
and there's something to be said about that.

450
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,200
So totally, totally fair, to be honest.

451
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,760
But I'm sure I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.

452
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,240
There was a whole period in the NES era when Tengen did it better.

453
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,720
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

454
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,520
I like how they go from like the CG part of the trailer to the gameplay,

455
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,640
and you're like, oh, it's like massively like

456
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,840
not as good as the CG part.

457
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,680
It's like, oh, this just looks pretty plain.

458
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,400
SSJ 100 Matt says this is like vanilla ice trying to say that ice ice baby

459
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,200
is different from under pressure.

460
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,640
Yeah, exactly. Exactly right.

461
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,280
More than 50% change.

462
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,640
Pirate Pound Town says get clean by playing dirty.

463
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,440
Orange Wright suggests the name bubble bath battlers.

464
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,680
Wait, that might be a bad name.

465
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,240
Yeah, don't don't call your game bubble bath babes

466
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,600
because people will think it's a completely different game from the NES era.

467
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,000
You can Google that, but it's NSFW just leaving that out there.

468
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,720
Anyhow. Yeah, it looks interesting.

469
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,080
I don't know. Neat.

470
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,160
We've got another trailer trailer for the plucky squire,

471
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,800
and it's a that RPG game that takes place like books.

472
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,360
And then you kind of kind of has a was it the

473
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,280
was it that gameplay element from the Legend of Zelda

474
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,160
in between worlds where you kind of like kind of go squish to like flat.

475
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
And so you're yeah, you go to D.

476
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,760
So kind of like that, I guess.

477
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,840
Mario Odyssey is similar.

478
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,080
Looks pretty sweet.

479
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,280
Console version of Teardown is coming.

480
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,440
That game is pretty awesome.

481
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,120
It's kind of a voxel heist game

482
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,080
and very, very cool because it's all physics based.

483
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,880
You can destroy buildings and all sorts of crazy stuff.

484
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,200
So cool that that's coming to consoles.

485
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,960
The rumored Metal Gear Solid three Snake Eater remake is a thing now,

486
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,560
and it's coming to the PlayStation five.

487
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,680
I think maybe even other platforms as well.

488
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,080
No word on when that's coming, but it is something that is in development.

489
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,360
I mean, yeah, that is neat.

490
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,200
I'm not not mad at that at all.

491
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,920
But is it a little weird that it's three and not one or two?

492
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,040
Like, wouldn't you want to do it was one of the best in the series, I guess.

493
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,320
Yeah. And I guess to be fair, like Silent Hill two is getting a remake.

494
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,560
So maybe it's just one of those.

495
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,400
They're remaking some of the PlayStation two era actually wasn't.

496
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,440
I can't remember. Was Metal Gear Solid three a PS two game or a PS three game?

497
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,080
This is a PS two game, wasn't it?

498
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,160
So then maybe they're maybe they're remaking the PS two era games

499
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,280
for whatever reason, had the most epic song.

500
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,520
The song better be intact.

501
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,320
It's in the trailer, so I'm assuming it's good. Good.

502
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,000
Good, good. Because sometimes you feed on a tree fog

503
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,400
because they they they, of course, after like teasing everything

504
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,080
because they don't really show you what what the trailer is for.

505
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,520
Initially, it's just a bunch of animals and stuff.

506
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,120
And then you see snake and then the music comes in.

507
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,720
It's like, yeah.

508
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,200
A couple of comments in chat on some of these things we're talking about,

509
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
but some really good feedback here in chat.

510
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,720
Tiger Claus pointing out Sony's copied Nintendo several times.

511
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,360
Remember PlayStation All Stars, which is a clone of Smash Brothers?

512
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,600
Yeah. And sadly, it wasn't quite as good, but that's not to say it was bad.

513
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,080
That game definitely had their fans.

514
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,040
And there's a lot of people they did with it.

515
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,800
A lot of people would love to see another one of those games, to be quite honest.

516
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,320
So I like how it like it combined like the backgrounds combined

517
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,640
like two different games together and they kind of like

518
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,840
there is stuff that went along with that.

519
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,600
So I think that was pretty sweet.

520
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,320
And I wish like we would get that a little bit more with like Smash Brothers

521
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,120
where instead of having like, say, a Kirby level,

522
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,320
you could have a Kirby level and then like Zelda stuff,

523
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,360
like kind of mashing together almost like in the stuff interacting.

524
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,920
It'd be really cool.

525
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,560
Fixation Gaze in chat says,

526
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,160
Does Sony not have their own ideas or do they need to copy others homework?

527
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,960
To be fair, I mean, I get I totally get that perspective.

528
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,600
It's Square Enix. That is true.

529
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,440
It's a Square Enix game.

530
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,520
But and certainly Square Enix has plenty of their own ideas,

531
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,960
even though, you know, they've made one game 16 times.

532
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
But they are all different.

533
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,160
They seem completely original.

534
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,040
Yeah. But also, you know, Sony is, you know, God of War and Last of Us.

535
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,760
They do they have the bandwidth to be able to do their own stuff, too.

536
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,080
But that is a good point that technically it's Square Enix

537
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,200
that's bringing it to Sony.

538
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,080
Yeah. And they all you know what?

539
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,320
You know what? If you think about sorry, I don't mean to cut you off.

540
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,880
But if you think about what Splatoon was anyway,

541
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,520
I mean, Splatoon was kind of a derivative idea.

542
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,240
If you think about it, it's just that it was the very Nintendo cutesy

543
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,880
way of doing a shooter and doing, you know, one of those more competitive

544
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,920
types of games.

545
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,440
And, you know, so was Splatoon itself a really original idea?

546
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
Eh, not really.

547
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,040
But Nintendo has their way of putting their own polish on everything.

548
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,840
So, you know, there's a lot of video games that are derivative

549
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,600
of something else, but they perfect the formula.

550
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,920
They make it better. Right.

551
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,520
So you can tell when you get your hands on the game.

552
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,920
I think that's, you know, obviously going to be the key.

553
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,400
Is this just a rip off or is this, you know, oh, it's an evolution,

554
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,160
because I would say there's a big difference between those two types of games,

555
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,320
an evolution and a rip off.

556
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,840
Anyhow, we had a game show called Towers of Gospa,

557
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,560
and it looks pretty sweet, pretty epic, kind of reminds me a bit

558
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,440
of Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, at least with the verticality to it.

559
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,520
They show these giant,

560
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,800
I guess they're like salmon or catfish or something like that,

561
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,120
giant flying catfish that you can actually land on

562
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,280
and collect things from and stuff like that and fighting monsters.

563
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,840
So kind of a little Monster Hunter vibe to it as well.

564
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,080
That looks pretty sweet.

565
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,760
We had another trailer for Final Fantasy 16.

566
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,920
So, you know.

567
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,560
Cool. I actually I purposely think all the characters

568
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,160
just look the same after a while.

569
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,600
I purposely did not watch the 16 trailer because I'm

570
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
I don't want to oversaturate at this point.

571
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,040
I want to just wait for the game to come out and play it.

572
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,240
I just have a hard time watching them now, just because I mean,

573
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,120
seriously, their characters have no variation between modern iterations now.

574
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,560
Yeah. Like, oh, all the all the the dark haired women look like Tifa.

575
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,080
Like, seriously, it's just they

576
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,040
their style isn't exciting anymore.

577
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,760
It's pretty.

578
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,520
Well, they're just not as like memorable like I think like Noctis or whatever.

579
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,640
I'm not really enthralled with the group from like 15 even.

580
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,960
Well, and you can even go back to like something like Final Fantasy 12,

581
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,520
where pretty much every character in that game was forgettable,

582
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,400
except for Balthier and Fran.

583
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,200
When you talk about Final Fantasy 12, that's all anybody wants to talk about.

584
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,880
And I'm sure somebody out there in chat is like, but I love Piniello,

585
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,720
but realize that most people could give a shit about any of the characters

586
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,160
in those games besides Balthier and Fran, who were the stars of that game.

587
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,320
Period. Well, I'll also say this.

588
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,480
I tried to play the game and got really bored with it. So.

589
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,720
Yeah, I don't think I've had fun in a Final Fantasy game since like.

590
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,400
Part of eight.

591
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,040
And of course, the MMOs.

592
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,600
Yeah, and I'm going sequentially because I still think

593
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,120
that Final Fantasy five is like the best of them.

594
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,680
Yeah, and I you know, again, I didn't hate 15,

595
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,200
but there was a lot of room for improvement in 15.

596
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,480
And I just it was not near 15 was not as good as 13 to me.

597
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,760
10 and 10 to got. Yeah, I could.

598
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,480
I borrowed your copy of 13, the first one, and I got kind of bored.

599
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,640
It is lightning needed personality.

600
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,360
It it I it's a fair criticism that Final Fantasy 13 takes 20 hours to get going.

601
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,600
It's a completely fair criticism, but I also kind of see to me

602
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,360
like there's certain TV shows that are the same way.

603
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,000
It's until it's not until the end of the first season

604
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,200
where things finally start to fucking escalate.

605
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,000
And that's how Final Fantasy 13 was.

606
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,520
And I think that's that's what kind of broke the deal for a lot of people.

607
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,440
And I get it. So.

608
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,880
But I'm still I'm so excited for the lightning to actually be worthy

609
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,960
of being a main character.

610
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,600
And I know I should have played more and I know she got better.

611
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,960
Yeah, but you know, but she she also gets upstaged by some of the supporting cast.

612
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,240
Like once you get Fang,

613
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,400
Fang is a incredible character that I sort of wish was explored

614
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,360
more in the follow ups.

615
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,200
She's there, but not nearly as much so because of things that happen in 13

616
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,160
dodging spoilers of a very old game. All right.

617
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,760
Anyhow, sorry, Loki.

618
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,640
That's right.

619
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,120
We had a game game play trailer for Alan Wake two, which looks pretty awesome.

620
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,440
And that's how we have October 17th.

621
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,440
They announced the next Assassin's Creed game,

622
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,280
so we have Assassin's Creed Mirage making the full transition

623
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,560
right back to Prince of Persia again. So

624
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,440
it looks interesting.

625
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm OK with that.

626
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,720
Revenant Hill, which is looking forward to this.

627
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,040
Yeah, I guess it's a game developed by Glory Society

628
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,520
where you play a cat named Twigs.

629
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,040
Who is a trying to become a witch's familiar.

630
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,320
That sounds fun.

631
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,400
Yeah, it's pretty fun looking.

632
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,040
I like the art style in it.

633
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,080
It gives me kind of limbo vibes, but.

634
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,440
With a little more with a little splash of color to it.

635
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,440
Yes, I know cat games have been doing very well for Sony,

636
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,920
like everybody lost their fucking mind about Stray.

637
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,040
And now what? Now we get a cat quest sequel,

638
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,760
although that game was everywhere, to be fair.

639
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,960
And you know, now this cat games are going to be all the rage.

640
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,840
And I better not hear a single damn one of you complaining about it

641
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,680
because this is this is a great thing for games.

642
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,080
And that's on period.

643
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,800
There's a trailer for Grand Blue Fantasy Relink,

644
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,800
which is out this winter,

645
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,440
and it is the next entry into the Grand Blue Fantasy series, I guess.

646
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,440
So cool looking JRPG there.

647
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,840
Street Fighter six had a new trailer and.

648
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,960
That game is out this week.

649
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,120
There are there are two heavy, heavy hitters for the year out this week.

650
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,640
Diablo for Street Fighter six.

651
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,000
This is this is a big week for games, you know, going into what would have been

652
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,120
E3 week, essentially the week after, well, maybe two weeks.

653
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,680
But still, it's summer is here, that's for sure.

654
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,480
But yeah, Street Fighter six looks awesome.

655
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,080
Like if I didn't know that, like all of my time would be spent on Diablo

656
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,920
until Final Fantasy 16 is out and then all my time will be spent on that.

657
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,880
I would get Street Fighter six right away.

658
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,200
But as it stands, I'm like, maybe if I can write it out till Black Friday,

659
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,160
I'll get it on a sale.

660
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,200
I know we're interested in it, to be honest.

661
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,480
I kind of only want to play Street Fighter six because of the little like

662
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,880
single player, like story mode or whatever,

663
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,600
because it reminds me a lot of like kind of the demo was great.

664
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,640
Yeah. Like was it the like a dragon stuff?

665
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,640
Oh, yeah. Like kind of weird.

666
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,040
It does have a bit of that. Yeah.

667
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,800
So I'm kind of wanting to check it out because of that.

668
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,160
I'll catch it on sale, probably.

669
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,640
But yeah, it looks interesting.

670
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
We had a game called Ultros.

671
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,600
Not really the final fans. So good.

672
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,800
But it's like a kind of a they compared to like a like a black like

673
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,520
1960s concert poster come to life.

674
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,200
It looks like it's very like this is why Dark Soccer likes it.

675
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,120
It looks like pinball.

676
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,000
It looks like a pinball, well, not the game, but the artwork on a pinball machine.

677
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,680
It looks like a 60s pinball.

678
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,760
But that's not.

679
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,640
But I'm leaning more toward like those

680
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,200
late 60s, early to mid 70s psychedelic posters.

681
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,920
And those are just like.

682
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
The colors are vibrant and they're garish,

683
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,480
but they work well in that style.

684
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,960
So I really just dig the inspiration behind it.

685
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,760
And it's really good.

686
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,160
I mean, we're not sick of Metroidvanias yet, right?

687
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
We're down for another one in the, you know, actually.

688
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,760
Eliminate the term.

689
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,120
Eliminate the term Metroidvania.

690
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,160
Yeah, I mean, it's a platformer.

691
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,080
End of story is exploratory platformer.

692
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,760
Action platformer.

693
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,160
A plant former?

694
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,120
No, I said an action platformer.

695
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,960
I thought you said platformer

696
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,200
based on the art, and I was going to laugh, but I guess I shouldn't.

697
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
No, action platformer or like,

698
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't know, like games like that have existed for well before.

699
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,640
Yeah. Symphony of the night.

700
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,040
Yeah. Before Metroid they existed.

701
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,120
I mean, I guess in some ways, adventure on the 2600

702
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,880
was kind of like that.

703
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,280
So anyway, Dragon's Dogma 2.

704
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,080
So that's Capcom's action RPG game finally coming out.

705
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,680
The sequel at least played some of the first one.

706
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,560
It was all right.

707
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,840
Yeah, I think that was one of those games that had the DLC on disk,

708
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,920
if I remember correctly, way back in the day.

709
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,440
Not a problem anymore, because, you know, I just played it on Mac on my

710
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,640
well, at the time on my PC.

711
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Yeah, they released that game everywhere.

712
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,040
So but it definitely has its fans.

713
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,440
So I know this is getting some people excited.

714
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,760
I like some of the character design looks looks neat.

715
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,160
They showed off more stuff for PlayStation VR, too.

716
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,600
So a few things. Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted Two

717
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,560
is going to be coming to the console as well.

718
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,080
Resident Evil 4 VR mode had a trailer for that.

719
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,440
Arizona Sunshine Two, which is coming out this spring on PlayStation VR

720
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,640
two and PC. Crossfire Sierra Squad,

721
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,920
which is going to be like a PlayStation two

722
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,480
or PlayStation VR two version of the game,

723
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,560
which that looks kind of cool.

724
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,160
Synapse, which we saw a trailer for this before.

725
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,600
I don't remember where exactly,

726
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,560
but this is going to be coming out

727
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,560
actually July 4th. Looks pretty cool.

728
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,520
It looks like a really neat game.

729
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,600
I just wish it wasn't directly first person.

730
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,240
Let me just jump in real quick on Five Nights at Freddy's,

731
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,440
because there's a great comment from Tiger Claw in chat.

732
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,280
Five Nights at Freddy's fans are eating good this week.

733
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,320
A teaser trailer for the movie adaptation got released.

734
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,640
It sure did. That looked pretty good.

735
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,760
So then the next day, a trailer for the ruined DLC for Security

736
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,840
Breach was released, then out of left field here in the PlayStation.

737
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,560
So you get a sequel to the VR game help wanted to

738
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,920
assumeably about the sister location.

739
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,720
So, yeah, it was it was a good week to be a Freddy fan, that's for sure.

740
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,360
Beat Saber's coming to PlayStation VR two,

741
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,760
which I honestly thought it already was, but they're going to be also

742
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,400
throwing in a queen themed music pack,

743
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,760
which I hope is available on all platforms because, you know,

744
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,440
the trailers don't don't stop me now. Yeah.

745
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,280
And I was also surprised Beat Saber wasn't already on PSVR two.

746
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,320
I think it had been announced, but I think

747
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,920
I think now it's it's just it's out now, basically.

748
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,920
So by the way, if you bought the original on PS4,

749
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,160
you can download the new one for free. That was kind of cool.

750
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,880
I saw except I don't have a PSVR two, so it does me no good.

751
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,520
But yeah, that's that's probably the whole thing.

752
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,760
Sony wants me to get one now that I already have a game available to play on it.

753
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,880
But here's the thing, like with the PlayStation VR stuff,

754
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,000
like Sony still didn't show any first party PlayStation VR game. Yeah.

755
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,760
It's like third party stuff.

756
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
And a lot of this stuff is just like.

757
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,240
Cool, Beat Saber.

758
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,480
That's not system seller.

759
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,680
That's on everything like, you know, cool Arizona sunshine.

760
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,160
I mean, that's also on like most VR platforms.

761
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,480
I would agree that this was good

762
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,720
and Sony needed to show some VR stuff

763
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,320
to show that they're sustaining PSVR two.

764
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,640
But you're absolutely right.

765
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,320
We need something first party.

766
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,840
And quite frankly, PSVR two needs its half life, Alex.

767
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,120
Like it needs a game of like that caliber that is exclusive

768
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,520
to the platform to really, I think, woo more people there.

769
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,720
I just don't think that's there yet.

770
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,480
I know they're saying the sales figures, but I can't help

771
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,800
but feel like some things are getting twisted to make that work.

772
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,840
Or maybe it's selling better in other countries.

773
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,240
I don't know. But I again,

774
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,160
I just don't feel like the catalog is really there yet.

775
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,600
But maybe there'll be a surprise for the holidays. Who knows?

776
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,320
Yeah. And then talk about out of nowhere.

777
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,520
So Bungie announced that they're making a new marathon game.

778
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,680
That looked really stylish and cool, to be honest.

779
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,520
It also looks like it has nothing to do with the original.

780
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,680
You have some sort of combo running man battle royale.

781
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,000
Yeah. But I'm, you know, I'm curious.

782
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,080
That's that's a pretty big thing to revive your oldest IP,

783
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,320
basically, and bring it back.

784
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,560
I think that's very interesting.

785
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,480
But I figure this game is probably still like at least two years away, probably.

786
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,520
So nothing to get excited about in the near term.

787
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,320
Destiny two, the final shape is going to be the next

788
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,400
and apparently last big expansion for the game.

789
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,800
So looking forward to those Destiny three trailers next year, I guess.

790
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,080
So that's going to be a thing that's coming out.

791
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,160
Concord, which is a game by Firewalk Studios.

792
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,520
And I don't know.

793
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,920
It looks somewhat interesting.

794
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,560
Not really sure about it because they don't really show too much of it.

795
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,000
Sorry, some audio.

796
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,480
I just see that whole part with them launching out

797
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,680
and it makes me think they've gone to plaid.

798
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,240
I like the like logo treatment that they did there.

799
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,240
But yeah, twenty twenty four.

800
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,840
So cool.

801
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,280
And then we get to some strange things.

802
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,640
So Project Q, which is Sony's answer to it's not really streaming.

803
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,000
So are like it's not like this competing against the steam deck,

804
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,360
but sort of kind of is it is a handheld device that's

805
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,840
based off of streaming games from your PlayStation console via remote play.

806
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,720
Which. I don't.

807
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,120
It's not the PlayStation switch, though, it's basically just like it's like

808
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,000
you can do this on your phone already.

809
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,320
In fact, we even sell like peripherals play that to do this.

810
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,920
But like, I don't know, it just looks ugly.

811
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,640
It looks weird.

812
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,440
I don't like it. I don't like it.

813
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,120
Jamie, I don't like PlayStation five earbuds.

814
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,520
I, I actually I'm not quite as negative as you're feeling, Loki.

815
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,960
I, I understand why something like this exists,

816
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,240
especially in those households where

817
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,120
mom or dad wants to use the TV to watch whatever.

818
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,200
And so you can play your game on this.

819
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,760
I would say this is Sony's version of the Wii U in a way.

820
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,760
It's the play deck.

821
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,520
Yeah. Or that. Yeah.

822
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,520
I mean, yeah, the steam deck, you know, play deck or whatever you want to say.

823
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,880
I think in a way it's that.

824
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,960
I think there could be something to say here.

825
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,840
Like, I think it could be very cool to do the whole like,

826
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,280
I'm going to tap into my PlayStation five while I'm in another city.

827
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,760
So like, for example, I was on San Diego for a work trip last week.

828
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,880
That's why I wasn't here on the show.

829
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,880
That would have been neat to have a device like this,

830
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,040
that I could tap into my PlayStation five. Although Loki, you're fair,

831
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,520
what you said,

832
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,880
you can already do this on your mobile phone if you just have the right little

833
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,600
clip for it. So, you know, but taking that a step.

834
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,960
You can be able to do that with Stadia.

835
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,640
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Taking this a step further and doing this sort of thing,

836
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,240
but it's not even cloud.

837
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,200
It's your PlayStation five that you're able to tap into on the internet.

838
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,640
Can you do it from a distance or do you have to be on the same network for that?

839
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,000
Because I remember that they have, you know, remote play.

840
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,600
When they talk about remote play, my expectation is that it's over the internet,

841
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,480
but I guess I could be wrong. If it's not over the internet,

842
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,320
then I forget what I'm saying here. I don't see the point of this device then.

843
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,560
But if it does it over the internet, then I think, you know, especially again,

844
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,160
as 5g gains more popularity,

845
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,320
there's going to be a space for this. But my concern is,

846
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,960
as Sony does this a lot, if they release it too early,

847
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,560
I'm not sure it's going to sell a ton right out the gate,

848
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,760
and then they're going to give up on it before it could reach its prime.

849
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,360
Yeah, it says you can use PlayStation remote play.

850
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,560
It says when connected to broadband network or mobile data.

851
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,640
So it says you can do it.

852
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,760
My question is, like, if you're going to buy a console for remote play,

853
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,360
I mean, just buy a Steam Deck because it's compatible with PC.

854
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,800
You could probably play this on a Steam Deck already.

855
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,920
Why would I want to buy a device that only works with the PlayStation five?

856
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,000
And is I mean, we don't even know how expensive it is yet. So.

857
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,160
It's probably at least a few hundred dollars, so why bother?

858
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,920
Like, I don't know.

859
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,440
It's yeah, it's got to be priced competitively with a Steam Deck for sure.

860
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,680
The consoles just haven't had much interesting if it's

861
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,120
unless it's the switch is just.

862
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,640
I almost think they're trying too hard with this one.

863
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,240
They're seeing, oh, everyone else has had success with this.

864
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,200
Why don't we try it too late?

865
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,160
The one thing I will say is that, you know, remember,

866
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,720
you can also do other things with your PlayStation in the multimedia world.

867
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,960
But to be fair, it's nothing you can't do with your phone

868
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,200
when it comes to things like streaming services and, you know, movies

869
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,840
and things like that, it's nothing you can't already do with your phone.

870
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,960
I I don't know.

871
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,480
I think this could be interesting, but not not if it's too expensive.

872
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,320
So, yeah, we need more details on this for sure.

873
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,040
I wish I wish PlayStation would just do another dedicated handheld,

874
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,200
but I get why they're hesitant to.

875
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,240
Yeah. And then finally, we got a new trailer for Marvel's Spider-Man two,

876
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,280
which is obviously a big game from Insomniac and one of the things that

877
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,000
Sony is very proud to show off for the PlayStation five.

878
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,040
Well, it's the holiday tent pole, basically.

879
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,200
So this is, you know, the biggest game, basically,

880
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,920
at least for as far as Sony sees it for the for the fall.

881
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,040
So I get it. Yeah.

882
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,560
And they show off Peter using, I guess, the dark venom suit,

883
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,960
as well as we see Miles Morales and some of his abilities as well.

884
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,640
So come out this fall. Awesome.

885
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,400
All right.

886
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,640
So PlayStation Showcase, very busy.

887
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,800
I mean, if you think about it, that was a lot.

888
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,280
That was like that was like 20 titles you just went over.

889
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,680
So there's there's a lot going on here.

890
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,920
So it's going to be an interesting year for Sony.

891
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,840
And it's going to be interesting

892
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,800
to see what Microsoft has ready to go in response in a couple of weeks.

893
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,280
And maybe Nintendo.

894
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,920
I mean, Nintendo is definitely the wild card in the room right now

895
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,560
because we we literally do not know what happens now.

896
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,040
You know, Zelda, of course, still has many people's attention. I get it.

897
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,800
But what comes in six months? We don't know.

898
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,920
So there's kind of an expectation there.

899
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,400
Nintendo is going to tell us soon what's next. What's after Zelda?

900
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,560
So I can't wait until we actually sit down with it,

901
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,360
because I've seen all kinds of fun things that people made.

902
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,000
Someone has officially made a yacht.

903
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,200
I like somebody did like a death trap type of thing

904
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,400
that they were putting the mobs in, like a cage.

905
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,040
They would slam down on the mobs.

906
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,840
It would just like electrocute them over. And I thought it was very funny.

907
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,880
Oh, I saw this awesome one where someone had flamethrowers

908
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,600
that went out in a circle.

909
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,280
And so once everything was lit up, they'd, you know, use the updraft

910
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,960
to to rise up above everything and then watch from above

911
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,840
while it just burned all of the enemies to bits.

912
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,360
It was it was great.

913
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,680
And then, of course, there was the the piss man.

914
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,560
Who had a fire hydrant for.

915
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,600
Yes, yes, yes.

916
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,920
We saw him already.

917
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,400
People, people were making like like at at type thing,

918
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,360
you know, like walking platforms with the

919
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,440
with the wheels as the mechanisms for the legs.

920
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,000
It was there's some really creative people out there,

921
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,720
and it just requires a simple understanding of basic physics.

922
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,920
Mm hmm. And I I'm I'm looking forward to trying to make a Gundam.

923
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,840
All right. I think I've seen that.

924
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,680
I the more and more I see people make these clever things,

925
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,480
the more I feel like I want to get the game.

926
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,040
But, you know, again, it's going to be a busy summer, so we'll see.

927
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,640
I'll find you one of the collections I saw. It was very impressive. Nice.

928
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,040
All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games

929
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,000
we have been playing this week, Zelda or otherwise.

930
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,360
So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you. How is your gaming week?

931
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,760
Two weeks worth of gaming, Rob.

932
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,600
Yeah, sure. Two weeks if you want.

933
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,520
Yeah. So I went to

934
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,960
Golden State Pinball Festival last weekend.

935
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,960
So they had a lot of really good ones,

936
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,320
including the the 007 anniversary limited edition.

937
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,880
And I'm going to tell you this right now.

938
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,000
It's not worth money.

939
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,040
It was not as fun as the the classic bond tables

940
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,800
that they have out there in the style of the the classic ones.

941
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,120
You kind of like what they did with Beatles.

942
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,800
Mm hmm. They're they're themed after different movies.

943
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,720
There was a Dr.

944
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,800
No was one of them, and that's the one that that I played.

945
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,920
I played the data.

946
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,600
I played every Star Wars that was there.

947
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,800
So I played a Data East one.

948
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,240
I played the stern and I played the Sega one.

949
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,120
They had the Foo Fighters table done by Jack Danger,

950
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,120
and they had the L.E., the limited edition, and they had the the pro.

951
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,520
And honestly, I think I liked the pro better than the limited edition.

952
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,480
I mean, having the multiple layers of it was great.

953
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,520
You couldn't freaking hear the music in there,

954
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,880
but I got to play in the tournament room when they were starting to pack up.

955
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,000
And the music was great.

956
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,040
The music selection is fantastic.

957
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,480
And the art in it is hilarious.

958
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,520
It's kind of got like the sort of semi Scooby Doo vibe of them

959
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,800
and their van and everything.

960
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,920
And then as far as oh, and I ran into Amanda.

961
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,240
I know. Thanks for the pick. Yeah. Yeah.

962
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,000
So they had a pin bot there.

963
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,480
They still put googly eyes on it, and it was hilarious.

964
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,840
I played Shaq Attack.

965
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,600
That is I've never gotten to play one.

966
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,360
It's a weird it's one of the gauntlet games.

967
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,360
So, you know, there's a really hit and miss.

968
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,760
It has this like whole mechanic where you go,

969
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,880
you shoot the pinball up a ramp to land in the net.

970
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,840
It's like this big plastic dome over it to protect the glass.

971
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,200
It's kind of kind of ingenious.

972
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,160
They had Galactic Tank Force, which is.

973
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,400
It's not a Jersey Jack, I think, or it might be.

974
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,120
Um, I'd have to look it up again, but it's it's cheese ball.

975
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,960
It's got full motion video.

976
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,560
It makes me think of like an old Sega CD game

977
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,400
with with the little cinematics on there.

978
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,160
I got way too distracted actually watching the the animated bits.

979
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,560
They someone had reskinned an old,

980
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,320
you know, classic table to The Walking Dead.

981
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,480
And that was pretty fun.

982
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,640
I played Mr.

983
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,560
and Ms. Pac-Man, which is a very, very, very weird table.

984
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,640
There was no baby Pac-Man.

985
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,040
I was quite sad.

986
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,840
I played Ultraman and Ultraman is actually identical table to Halloween.

987
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,760
So I enjoyed them.

988
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,840
There's people who are like, it's kind of boring.

989
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,360
I thought it was just fine.

990
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,960
I thought it was fun.

991
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,720
I played a junkyard.

992
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,280
I played this bell ringer thing.

993
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,720
We set some stuff on fire.

994
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,720
Oh, total nuclear annihilation.

995
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,520
Best soundtrack.

996
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,920
It is on Apple Music, Spotify, all of the things.

997
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,440
Absolutely get it.

998
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,920
It's such good.

999
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Retro new wave if you if you like the style.

1000
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,360
And it's it's just such a good table.

1001
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,880
I super love it.

1002
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,440
There was also they had a joust tabletop.

1003
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,920
I play OK, so here was my disappointment of the show, and that was Scooby Doo.

1004
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,640
I mean, it was all the new voices, which I mean,

1005
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,280
some of them are OK, but it just wasn't very fun.

1006
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,240
So, OK, so you know how Black Knight 2000 has the double playfield, right?

1007
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,080
Right. And you have to do the loop and then shoot the top.

1008
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,000
This is almost built like Black Knight 2000.

1009
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,840
But it's so slow and the voices are annoying

1010
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,000
and the sound effects are annoying and it just and the flippers,

1011
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,040
I don't think are a standard with the part and a little bit off center.

1012
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,240
So it just was not fun to me at all at all.

1013
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,240
Although I have to say the aesthetics of the table were were spot on.

1014
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
Absolutely spot on.

1015
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,760
And I said I played Halloween, which I took a lot of pictures of it

1016
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,400
just because I thought the touches in the Halloween one are so good.

1017
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,160
I also

1018
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,320
I played a bunch of Foo Fighters, actually.

1019
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,560
I just had so much fun with Foo Fighters.

1020
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,440
I played yeah, there's there I'm

1021
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,640
actually looking at my photo library so I can see I played the Mandalorian again.

1022
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,240
I played X-Men.

1023
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,880
I played a bunch.

1024
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,840
I just I played the Evil Knievel table when we were talking about,

1025
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,280
you know, racing and stunts.

1026
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,000
And I'm I'm sure the listeners understand

1027
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,560
you played a lot of pinball at the expo, for sure.

1028
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,760
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1029
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,200
But the biggest the biggest ones.

1030
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,200
Oh, and there's another game and I have to have this.

1031
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,800
It's called Bad Cats.

1032
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,920
And it has this little thing in the middle of it

1033
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,040
where like this lady is trying to chase a cat out with a broom

1034
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,080
and the cats all over the table are just like living their best life.

1035
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,440
I love this table. It's so good.

1036
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,760
But yeah, I played a lot of pinball, but I absolutely think

1037
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,000
that the star of the show was Foo Fighters.

1038
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,280
Both versions are tremendously good.

1039
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,040
And if there's someone who knows

1040
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,360
how to have fun in pinball, it's definitely going to be Jack Danger.

1041
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,600
Also, he's given me good advice for buying Dan a birthday present once.

1042
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,880
He's just a cool guy, but he's actually retired from streaming now, I think.

1043
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,920
Yeah, but at any any rate, of course, Dead by Daylight,

1044
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,640
significant amounts.

1045
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,720
I played Midnight Sun's Cult of the Land.

1046
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,920
The new DLC is absolutely hilarious. I love it.

1047
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,360
I've been having a pretty solid good time in that. So, yeah.

1048
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,200
All right. Well, if that is it for your gaming week, we'll go to Loki.

1049
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,120
How was your gaming week?

1050
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,160
My gaming week was just Minecraft.

1051
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,720
I'm doing lots of building and getting ready to put out another episode.

1052
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,880
So nice. Yep.

1053
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
It was a lot of a lot of building.

1054
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,480
Look forward to see. Is it another like like how many bricks in this build?

1055
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,680
I don't know.

1056
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,440
I don't know because like the because it involved digging out a big hole.

1057
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,480
So it it's hard to say.

1058
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,520
There was it was forty six shulker boxes at one point.

1059
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,640
But I didn't I think I I tend to like try to get myself extras

1060
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:06,240
in case I miss something in my schematic that I put together like

1061
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,920
or I want to blend in some of the terrain a little bit more or something like that.

1062
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,960
So I don't know if I used all of them.

1063
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,520
I have that.

1064
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,160
I was going to calculate it when I'm done with all the build,

1065
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,960
but it's pretty much done and just have the redstone left to do inside of it.

1066
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,200
But yeah, there's another giant Mega Man thing that's in there.

1067
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,000
All right. Nice.

1068
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,920
Looking forward to seeing it. Yep.

1069
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,200
All right.

1070
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,920
My gaming week, because I was on a business trip most of the week,

1071
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,560
my gaming week was a little abbreviated.

1072
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,840
But Dark Soccer, you made this is going to surprise you.

1073
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,960
I also played pinball when I was down there because San Diego has a coin

1074
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,240
up like they have here in SAC.

1075
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,680
And, you know, the coin up chain, for whatever reason, they really like pinball.

1076
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,840
I also played the Foo Fighters table this time.

1077
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,120
Isn't it good? It's really good.

1078
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,920
I don't know if it was regular or limited edition.

1079
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,560
I'm sorry. Actually, did it have a top layer?

1080
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,600
I don't think so.

1081
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,640
But let me check, because actually what I can do is thanks to that whole,

1082
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,480
like stern insider thing, which I love.

1083
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,800
You can see I can actually see my history of what I played here.

1084
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,480
So I can actually tell you.

1085
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,200
But I know I played that Avengers machine for the first time,

1086
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,680
and I got two free replays on my first game of that.

1087
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,800
So that was like awesome that I was able to do that.

1088
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,200
So let's see, I'm going in and looking right now.

1089
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,040
OK, Foo Fighters Pro, it says pro.

1090
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,680
All right, you play the pro.

1091
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,600
OK, and then I played Godzilla Pro Avengers Infinity Quest.

1092
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,560
That was a machine I got three replays on.

1093
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,000
Was pro. And then I played Mandalorian.

1094
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1095
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,320
The Avengers game is actually pretty good.

1096
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,040
I liked it. I liked it.

1097
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,440
So that was, yeah,

1098
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,520
random pinball adventure of my own that when I was trying to kill time

1099
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,440
in San Diego in the evening.

1100
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,480
If I can add one more thing.

1101
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,400
Yeah, we actually just getting rid of our medieval madness.

1102
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,200
And I forgot what else we got rid of.

1103
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,720
It might have been Iron Maiden.

1104
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,560
And we now have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1105
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,800
The newer one. Oh, we have Black Knight Sword of Rage.

1106
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,120
And we have we already had the limited edition topper.

1107
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,800
So that's getting added on.

1108
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,600
And then, of course, Weird Al's on his way.

1109
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,280
I'm I'm sure you've heard of it, but I was listening to Bobby's show last week

1110
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,440
since we weren't here to hear it live.

1111
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,200
And he was talking about

1112
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,360
like a vinyl soundtrack for some pinball games, including medieval madness.

1113
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,960
And I was like, total nuclear annihilation is getting one. Interesting.

1114
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,600
I just I wasn't sure if you were on this because I knew you were a fan

1115
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,400
of medieval madness.

1116
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,160
And I this the like when I heard the song that

1117
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,560
like that whole thing of like, oh, I've heard this in Darksiders garage.

1118
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,560
That was only that was Black Knight 2000.

1119
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,600
Oh, no. Yes, it was Black Knight.

1120
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,960
Sorry. Medieval something.

1121
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,160
Sword of Rage has a Black Knight 2000 mode

1122
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,720
that plays some of the the old stuff.

1123
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,920
Interesting.

1124
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,840
By the way, I sent you the picture of the of the bad cats.

1125
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,280
I'll have to check that out.

1126
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,680
Sorry, my phone is on monitor right now. But yeah.

1127
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,600
Discord.

1128
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,080
As far as video games go, I've been playing more Dead by Daylight

1129
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,280
than I usually do, just with the double blood points happening this weekend.

1130
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,520
I'm like, oh, I guess I should like actually work on the tome.

1131
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,360
So I finally got Renaldo to prestige one.

1132
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,200
That's cool, I guess.

1133
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,400
Renaldo is so loud, though.

1134
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,440
Oh, well, I mean, I just wanted his perks.

1135
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,120
So yeah. But do you think he's like Leon levels of loud?

1136
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
He's pretty loud.

1137
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,200
I thought they were going to equalize that.

1138
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,600
They're supposed to equalize all the volumes at some point. I don't know.

1139
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,520
But I've been I've been working on.

1140
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,040
So I have like every perk on Cheryl, every perk on Leon, purple perk meeting.

1141
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,520
I want to do that for Dwight.

1142
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,160
I think I'm going to work on now as well.

1143
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,520
So, yeah, so it's been placed in Dead by Daylight.

1144
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,360
Final Fantasy 14 got a new patch this week, the Dark Throne.

1145
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,280
This is the one where Golbez is a big fight in it.

1146
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,400
I mean, spoiler alert, but we know that they've been doing

1147
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,480
a lot of Final Fantasy 4 content with these patches.

1148
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,720
So it just was natural that you're going to fight Golbez.

1149
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,840
I thought they did it really well.

1150
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:08,160
Again, Soken kicks butt on the soundtrack and he did a remix of the moon theme

1151
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,480
that plays on the outside of the moon, the really haunting kind of song.

1152
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,800
He did that for like the I won't get too much into the details,

1153
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,600
but for the place, you would assume a theme like that would be used

1154
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,680
in Final Fantasy 14 as well is very, very well done.

1155
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,400
So I like where the story went there.

1156
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,640
I'm very curious to see what the expansion lead up ends up being,

1157
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,800
because I could see it kind of go in a couple of different directions right now.

1158
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,480
So it'd be very interesting.

1159
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Yeah, so that was pretty much my gaming week, honestly,

1160
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,720
not a lot of new stuff.

1161
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,880
But this week, I know there's some big stuff coming.

1162
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,400
So I'm very, very excited about it, that's for sure.

1163
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,280
All right, we're going to get into some news here at the top of the show,

1164
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,040
even though we're like an hour in because the PlayStation Showcase.

1165
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,840
But I thought we could start tonight with some headlines that actually focus

1166
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,280
on last week because we we missed some big announcements

1167
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,880
by not being here last week.

1168
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,320
So, Loki, what was one of the big things we heard about last week?

1169
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:06,040
Last week, we got the reveal of the new game from NetherRealm Studios.

1170
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,880
It is another reboot of Mortal Kombat.

1171
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,360
So now Mortal Kombat one is going to be coming out September 19th.

1172
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,720
Let's do the time warp again.

1173
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,880
It would technically just reset the timeline in Mortal Kombat 11.

1174
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,240
Yeah, that's but now but now it's like, oh, but in this timeline now,

1175
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,680
Sub-Zero and Scorpion can be friends, as can maybe Katana and Mileena.

1176
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:38,920
So now and now Liu Kang is a god and Raiden's just a normal farmer.

1177
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,440
So that was from the end of Mortal Kombat 11.

1178
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,560
No, I know. So yeah, they are they are continuing the story,

1179
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,400
but I can't help but feel like, OK, they just did this in Mortal Kombat 9.

1180
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,400
But OK, I mean, do we really care? Nah.

1181
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,200
Like, as long as the game's good, who gives a shit?

1182
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,960
Let him reboot it every game. Who cares?

1183
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,320
Just just have some good characters, some good moves, fluid gameplay,

1184
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,240
and people are going to eat it up. It's fine.

1185
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,440
I think the like alternate take could be interesting.

1186
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,080
But the only thing that's going to be weird about it, sorry.

1187
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,600
The only thing that's going to be weird about it is that meanwhile,

1188
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,240
we have these updates on the Mortal Kombat 2 movie.

1189
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,200
So they've cast the actresses that are going to play like Jade and Katana,

1190
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,160
like some of the news is out there about that.

1191
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,040
So they're doing a second Mortal Kombat movie, obviously.

1192
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,920
But now it's like, OK, wait a minute.

1193
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,400
So now we have the movie timeline, the game timeline

1194
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,280
that it's starting to feel like Marvel over here.

1195
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,040
So but it's fine. It's just it's just funny.

1196
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,200
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's it's.

1197
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,600
I assume the movie is going to be like a different.

1198
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,200
I mean, they have like I don't know if that movie really felt like

1199
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,320
it followed one of the official timelines of the game.

1200
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,640
They kind of do their own thing, but.

1201
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,480
I'm sure it'll be fine.

1202
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,600
Comment in chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network.

1203
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Zen Monkey 11 says I was over Mortal Kombat after Mortal Kombat 3,

1204
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,920
as were a lot of people, to be fair.

1205
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,000
Not everybody took to the 3D.

1206
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,560
I liked Mortal Kombat 4 and I think 4 had some really good characters.

1207
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,440
Like I love Tanya.

1208
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,000
I love like who is the wind god, Fujin, I think.

1209
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,520
Like there were some really good characters in 4 that I liked.

1210
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,480
But I understand the shift to 3D.

1211
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,640
It didn't work completely for Mortal Kombat.

1212
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,240
And then I think what made Mortal Kombat hard to follow for me

1213
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,960
for a while was that it left the arcades.

1214
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,640
So then they had a string of a bunch of games like Deadly Alliance,

1215
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,400
Armageddon and all these games that were console only releases.

1216
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,240
Basically.

1217
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,280
So I think a lot of people and they didn't number them anymore.

1218
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,440
So I think a lot of people kind of fell out of the series

1219
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,200
while they were releasing these console only things that wasn't having

1220
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,800
parity with arcade releases.

1221
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,120
And then finally, Mortal Kombat 9 essentially rebooted Mortal Kombat.

1222
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,680
That was the first reboot.

1223
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,040
And that was I mean, because that was kind of a neat.

1224
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,160
Even though, yes, I play those games, I'm like, God, the violence is

1225
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,720
the violence is starting to be a bit much in these games, especially

1226
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,720
11 and 10.

1227
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,240
Like, damn, it's it's hard to watch.

1228
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,600
It's hard to watch, quite frankly.

1229
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,880
But at least I know when to look away, you know, the game.

1230
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,320
But the game itself is really fluid.

1231
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,000
So it's it's it's it is a good fighter.

1232
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,520
Like it's you can't deny that.

1233
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,200
So there's that.

1234
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,600
Anyway, so I'm excited for Mortal Kombat 1, just from a story perspective,

1235
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,800
as much as I tease it for doing the time warp again,

1236
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,400
I think it will be kind of interesting.

1237
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,200
And I'm curious what direction they go with it.

1238
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,160
But of course, it is about the gameplay.

1239
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,840
So. All right.

1240
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,560
Well, moving on to another story here.

1241
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,600
Unfortunately, last week, we had a legend in the industry pass away.

1242
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,400
So I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of Bob

1243
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,080
Smith to video game culture.

1244
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,160
Bob Smith was from Atari and iMagic back in the day.

1245
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,280
He was a programmer at Atari in the early 80s.

1246
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:20,320
His first big game was video pinball, which was a pretty, pretty epic.

1247
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,920
I mean, obviously you play it now and you go, this is kind of compared to like

1248
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,720
but for its time, right?

1249
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,200
It was like, oh, it's like pinball on my TV.

1250
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,960
It was pretty cool for the time.

1251
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,880
So he brought that.

1252
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,920
But I mean, if you think about it, that would be like the first pinball video game.

1253
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,840
I think there may be a computer game that predates it.

1254
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,400
But the first major, I guess we'll say that

1255
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,600
he was then a supervisor.

1256
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,080
He actually was Howard Scott Warshaw's boss.

1257
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,160
So, you know, you could maybe blame ET a little bit on him.

1258
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,160
No, I don't know. Anyway, he also programmed games to the Atari 2600,

1259
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,280
including one of my very favorites from iMagic.

1260
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,160
I did a YouTube on this that's still on my channel like seven years ago.

1261
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,560
Dragon Fire, one of my absolute favorite 2600 games.

1262
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,480
You are correct.

1263
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,840
What?

1264
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,600
About video pinball.

1265
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,040
It was the first? OK, cool.

1266
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,600
1977. Wow.

1267
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,000
Golly, golly. OK, so.

1268
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,200
But yeah, he did Dragon Fire, which is a really underrated classic.

1269
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,640
Riddle of the Sphinx.

1270
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,400
That's a really good game, too.

1271
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,360
Holy shit. That's a trip down memory lane.

1272
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,880
I haven't thought of that game a long time.

1273
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,080
Moonsweeper.

1274
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,560
And he did the port of the Star Wars arcade game that was on Atari,

1275
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,600
which for what it was, was the best they could do on the Atari hardware.

1276
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,880
So that's that's awesome.

1277
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,600
So kudos and a tip of the hat to Bob Smith on an incredible career

1278
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,840
who went on to work at companies like Accolade, the 3DO company,

1279
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,480
and then a mobile startup called Innovative Leisure that was by some Xbox folks.

1280
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,240
He also went to the Portland Retro Game Expo an awful lot.

1281
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,960
So but unfortunately, yes, he passed away last week.

1282
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,160
So just rest in peace and thank you for the contributions to gaming culture.

1283
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,760
Thank you, Tiger Claw, for digging up the YouTube channel

1284
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,040
and the YouTube on Dragonfire, which again, it's a great game.

1285
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,960
It's one of those.

1286
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,760
It's that formula of the 2600 era that I love.

1287
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:23,200
It's an incredibly simple concept with a highly addictive game loop.

1288
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,760
And Dragonfire was basically two screens.

1289
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,800
It was the bridge screen and the treasure room screen.

1290
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,080
And when you're on the bridge,

1291
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,080
you're dodging fire that the dragon's spitting at you, basically.

1292
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,760
And then when he gets to the treasure room,

1293
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,080
you try to collect all the treasure again while dodging the dragon's fire.

1294
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,320
You escape that.

1295
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,240
You're back on the bridge and you're doing this game loop over and over.

1296
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,680
And it's very it's very addictive.

1297
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,400
And I know that sounds very simple,

1298
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,320
but a lot of the 2600 games were and that's what made them great.

1299
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,520
Think about a game like Kaboom,

1300
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,880
which is like one of the all time greatest Atari 2600 games.

1301
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,160
What a simple fucking game.

1302
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,280
And that's the one with the water buckets where you catch the bombs.

1303
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,960
That's all. It was a paddle game.

1304
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,240
That's all you've you've played this at some point in your life.

1305
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,680
You all have. Yeah.

1306
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,880
It's an incredibly simple game,

1307
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,040
but without it, there's so much other that followed it.

1308
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,160
Anyway, I'm digressing a little bit.

1309
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,920
Old man yells at Cloud.

1310
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,280
Let's move on.

1311
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,880
Dark Soccer, now I know you want to talk to us about some Dead

1312
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,760
by Daylight news that came out last week,

1313
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,920
but I think a little more important,

1314
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,640
possibly some community updates from this week.

1315
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,640
I want to give you some space

1316
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,160
to talk about what's going on in the DVD community, actually.

1317
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,200
So for anyone,

1318
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,680
I don't think that hardly anyone has ever gone

1319
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,800
to a Dead by Daylight stream and not heard of PUPPERS.

1320
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,280
Well, I mean, especially, you know,

1321
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,480
behavior issued like a a charm.

1322
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,320
But but PUPPERS has been dealing with ALS,

1323
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,000
which was formerly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

1324
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,440
It's a neuromotor function disorder that causes

1325
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,000
in the spine to start stiffening up and it affects,

1326
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,080
of course, respiration, everything else.

1327
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,440
It's terrible. It's terrible.

1328
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,400
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1329
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,640
And well, PUPPERS has it.

1330
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:16,200
And on the 25th, you went into respiratory distress

1331
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,040
and went into the hospital

1332
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,800
and needed a bunch of oxygen, but just decided to to come home.

1333
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,240
You know, there there wouldn't have been.

1334
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,120
According to what what Sunshine Post did,

1335
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,080
there isn't going to be like much use in it.

1336
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,280
It would just be a few days of prolonging as opposed to,

1337
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,640
you know, anything significant.

1338
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:45,440
But then as of the 27th, so yesterday for us,

1339
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,680
he went back into the hospital because of aspiration pneumonia.

1340
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,520
And so right now he's in the hospital.

1341
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,080
But there's a kudos board up.

1342
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,040
I'll find the link.

1343
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,120
And apparently all of these messages

1344
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,720
of affection and support have just meant a whole lot.

1345
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:10,320
So I'm going to find the kudos board and link it to everybody.

1346
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,760
So if you want to, you know, leave a a good word,

1347
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,400
then I'm sure that it would be very appreciated.

1348
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,240
Well, well, there's still time to do so.

1349
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,160
I will point out as well, you know, for those that play the game,

1350
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,680
maybe a little bit lightly or what have you.

1351
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,520
I will point out that there is a charm you can actually get in the game

1352
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,760
and you can still get it.

1353
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,600
And the code is warrior puppers, all one word there.

1354
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,840
And you can actually get a charm.

1355
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,040
And there's a lot of people in game.

1356
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,760
You might actually saw this charm on a hook this weekend while I was playing.

1357
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,240
And it actually took me a minute to have it click.

1358
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,720
And then when I was on Twitter later, I was like, oh, right.

1359
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,800
And so that's actually so there's a lot of people that are rocking this charm,

1360
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,360
just kind of like in support right now of everything.

1361
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,600
So, again, that's warrior puppers.

1362
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,800
I haven't I haven't played since all that went down

1363
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,760
except to log in for my my daily bonuses.

1364
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,800
But yeah, when I sign on tonight,

1365
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:15,680
I'm going to be going in and the Vic Viper will be retired in favor of puppers.

1366
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,000
So, yeah, so obviously, you know, and I will admit

1367
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,120
I was not super familiar with puppers until.

1368
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,120
But I have a lot of friends that are.

1369
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,920
So it's it's getting in the algorithm in my social media person.

1370
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,120
Yeah. And I actually went back and watched some clips

1371
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,440
and he seemed like a lot of fun.

1372
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,600
And boy, does the man resemble bald Dwight.

1373
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,360
That was right.

1374
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,440
That was like, dang,

1375
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:47,000
there's really resembles him saying that Dwight should be renamed Max.

1376
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,920
Mm hmm. I honestly think that the bald Dwight

1377
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:56,640
skin just needs to be made the like the Max cosmetic, kind of like how

1378
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,080
there's other character cosmetics for like there's the Chris and Carlos

1379
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,520
for Leon and whatnot.

1380
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,360
I've seen some discourse trademark patent pending on Twitter about

1381
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,360
would it be appropriate to have him as a survivor in the game that gets killed?

1382
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,960
It might be a little in poor taste for some.

1383
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,880
My perspective is do whatever the family and him wants in this case.

1384
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,520
I think it would be very nice.

1385
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,480
I think a nice, you know, this this particular charm

1386
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,640
we just talked about, they gave away for free.

1387
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,080
What if they did a shirt where the funds raised from the shirt for

1388
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,480
for a survivor, Dwight or whoever, although how would it not be Dwight?

1389
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,800
But like the survivor shirt, maybe for the core four or something

1390
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,880
that maybe can raise money for ALS research and support.

1391
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,720
I thought I'd buy that in a heartbeat.

1392
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,920
I think that would be a great thing to do.

1393
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,360
Behavior actually put out a really sweet letter

1394
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,480
and even harkened back to that Dwight resemblance. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. So.

1395
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,120
I don't know, I think that we'll we'll see something, you know, when when people

1396
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:07,240
you know, when people like that have touched so many others, you know.

1397
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,440
They they just become

1398
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,120
something a little bit more than just the person, you know what I mean?

1399
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:20,280
And I would have to agree that everyone's been calling them

1400
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,960
a light in the fog, and I agree. Yeah.

1401
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,240
So well, our thoughts go out to the family and the loved ones, for sure.

1402
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,760
And of course, puppers in this case.

1403
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,320
I my my my comment on the Kudo board was that

1404
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,160
I hope that these next days are full of peace. Mm hmm.

1405
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,720
Um, anyway, I know it's a difficult pivot, but let's talk about some of the other

1406
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,200
Dead by Daylight news that came out officially from Behavior

1407
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,760
this this two weeks ago, I guess this one because of leaks.

1408
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,800
Behavior did their anniversary live stream early.

1409
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,040
And and I'll I'll be honest, I I had already watched the trailers

1410
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,720
and everything myself, but they had done that teaser at first

1411
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,800
saying that Nicolas Cage was going to be in the game as a survivor.

1412
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,400
And while we're not seeing much of anything official, Eurogamer.

1413
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,520
Said that that according from to the official blurb,

1414
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,040
I'll just read this after countless awards and over 100 movies

1415
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,600
shot across the globe, Nicolas Cage has seen it all and done it all.

1416
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,680
Or so he thought.

1417
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,360
While on set filming the role of a lifetime, his performance

1418
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,080
summoned the entity, a malevolent being of incomprehensible power,

1419
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,320
a.k.a. Mia.

1420
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,160
The actor soon found himself cast in otherworldly, worldly fog,

1421
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,040
forced to survive against a host of terrifying killers

1422
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,480
deadlier than even the most scathing film critic.

1423
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,040
That means they have to have Roger Ebert as a killer.

1424
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,480
Just saying, I, I really don't know what to think about this.

1425
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,520
This is just really like, do you do you remember the meme

1426
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,520
from like 10 years ago of the old lady going, what?

1427
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,520
Like that, that was my reaction to this trailer. What?

1428
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,560
But it's okay.

1429
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,480
Honestly though, the outfit that he was wearing in the trailer,

1430
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,400
someone pointed out that it's very much like in another movie coming out.

1431
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,680
So I'm not sure, but there were quite a few things that were brought up

1432
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,000
in the seventh anniversary live stream.

1433
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,560
Oh, just real quick before you get into that, I'm sorry.

1434
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,600
I just want to say, I don't hate this for the record.

1435
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,720
I think it's it's a very Nic Cage thing to do.

1436
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,720
So why not?

1437
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,680
Loki, let me ask you for a minute.

1438
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:37,040
Does Nic Cage in Dead by Daylight make you more interested in Dead by Daylight?

1439
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,960
It does increase my interest in Dead by Daylight.

1440
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,160
See, there you go.

1441
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,800
And that's that's the why I would be so that I would be interested

1442
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,800
to see like what like they pair them up with.

1443
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,680
Because I'm going to become a Nic Main.

1444
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,600
Well, they don't.

1445
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,280
To be fair, there are characters that come out with no killer.

1446
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,880
Like, for example, Ash from Evil Dead does not have a counterpart killer.

1447
01:15:58,920 --> 01:15:59,920
And there are just as.

1448
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,240
And there's killers that came out without survivors like Leatherface and Ghostface.

1449
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,200
As long as he gets a perk called One True God, then we're good, I think.

1450
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,720
I think it goes back to the red.

1451
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,480
So those that have a raising Arizona skin.

1452
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,960
But it's actually it's funny because it was

1453
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,400
Tiara was the one who told me

1454
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,640
and they were like, are they trying to get me to play this game?

1455
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,960
I'm like, if anyone I know loves Nic Cage, it's them for sure.

1456
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:36,640
So, yeah, anyway, there there is so much more awesome, though,

1457
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,160
because they're going to be a lot of quality of life improvements,

1458
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,120
including an anti camping technique,

1459
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,320
which isn't too far off from the one I suggested.

1460
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:52,280
Remember, I said that the the countdown timer should stop

1461
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,800
depending on the distance of the killer to the hook.

1462
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:59,640
Well, now what's going to happen is that there's a timer. Yes.

1463
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,600
But it's the closer they are to the hook.

1464
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,320
The the killer, the killer, the survivor on the hook

1465
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:12,840
will be able to unhook themselves a lot deliverance or slippery meat.

1466
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,240
But it also works on second hook.

1467
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,200
OLR stays winning on the predictions in 2023, that's for sure.

1468
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,360
But I do kind of see abuse for the second hook one for people who bring Moris.

1469
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,960
Mm hmm. Now they would do something about tumbling, then we'd be perfect.

1470
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,360
But we know we're waiting on it.

1471
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,800
And then, of course, there was the new trailer for in transmission,

1472
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:40,120
which is therefore aid the sci fi horror, which I think is cool.

1473
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:46,560
They have the killer is called the Singularity, which is this.

1474
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,800
I guess it's a cybernetic creature that started absorbing human parts

1475
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,600
so that it could function more effectively and killed everybody.

1476
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,880
You know, very aliens, alien like.

1477
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,760
And Gabriel Soma is the survivor and he's very pretty.

1478
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,480
The Mori is disgusting, by the way.

1479
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,320
Have you seen have you seen the Mori? It's disgusting.

1480
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1481
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,040
I saw Nick play some of it on because, you know, I still can't get PTB

1482
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,200
to work on the thing. Right.

1483
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,520
Not like the Borg. Think of the Borg in reverse.

1484
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,680
OK, wait, I'm going to I'm going to play this on stream,

1485
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,200
but I'm going to put a content warning out.

1486
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,720
But I am I am just playing a video game here.

1487
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,280
So and you won't be able to see us on the podcast feed anyway.

1488
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,080
But let me let me play this Mori for you on stream here.

1489
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,520
Sorry, I'm getting it set up here because you'll see that this

1490
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,320
it really goes next level with some of the light gore

1491
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,160
that they're doing in the game, basically.

1492
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,360
So and that's the new survivor.

1493
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,840
And so it's it's pretty gross. But

1494
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,800
that's what some people want out of Dead by Daylight

1495
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,240
is melted faces.

1496
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,600
So there you go.

1497
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,600
OK, the shot is done for those that looked away.

1498
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,800
All right. At any at any rate, the well, you know,

1499
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,160
people are just going to walk around taking pictures of the corpses.

1500
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,040
I'm sorry, I do that.

1501
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,000
But but anyway, the thing's power is really neat, though,

1502
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,680
because you put these globs up that act as cameras.

1503
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:16,920
And so you can pretty much watch like whole areas of the map

1504
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,320
and then shoot the glob onto somebody.

1505
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,040
And you have to do shit to get it off.

1506
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,200
And yeah, I'm not going to go in.

1507
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:29,720
I love S.H.A. 100 Matt's comment in chat saying like any horror franchise,

1508
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,760
it eventually ends up in space. Yes.

1509
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,800
And Fixation Gaze, big fan of the Mori saying DBD needs more of this.

1510
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,440
There are a lot of people

1511
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,400
who does not like getting Moried at all.

1512
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,480
Like, I will die on that second hook to avoid a Mori.

1513
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,680
That's just how I am.

1514
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,680
I don't know what it is.

1515
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,680
It's just like some thing in my brain.

1516
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,280
But at any rate,

1517
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,640
they're also going to be doing partnerships for cosmetics

1518
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,080
for with Slipknot and Iron Maiden.

1519
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,040
And the one that makes me really happy is with Nakamura Ikumi,

1520
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,640
who is just a wonderful, wonderful concept artist.

1521
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,240
But my the best cosmetic in the universe is coming out.

1522
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,080
We are finally getting Sukeban Julie.

1523
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,760
I've told we know what a Sukeban is, right?

1524
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,120
Well, for the listeners that don't.

1525
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:29,360
OK, so it was very much a big trope in like 80s manga anime TV.

1526
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,080
It's the the schoolgirl that wears the extra long like Zaki in Project Justice.

1527
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,520
Mm hmm. Or Sukeban Deco, which was another anime, The Girl with the Yo-Yo.

1528
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,360
But like wear the mask, although hers is the full legion mask,

1529
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:48,360
the hair pulled back and the extra long pleated skirt and the kind of oversized,

1530
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,600
you know, sailor top and, you know, kind of a bad ass girl.

1531
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,640
It kind of like go go you body. But.

1532
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,640
This is. Yeah, and she did.

1533
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:04,480
She had just a regular schoolgirl outfit and not a not the Sukeban look

1534
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,320
is very specific, but I'll find I'll find a picture.

1535
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:11,640
But for anyone who played Project Justice, it's Zaki kind of same

1536
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,960
same relative look.

1537
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:18,400
Yeah. And not like the sweater outfit, but the full on sailor top.

1538
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,040
But anyway, I'm very happy about that because Julie needs

1539
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,800
all the love because Susie gets all the cosmetics. Just saying.

1540
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,760
All right. To our relative.

1541
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,160
There's one more thing. One more.

1542
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,480
Yeah, I was to say, there's one more thing I'm waiting for you to get to,

1543
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,440
because I think it's really exciting.

1544
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:41,040
Yeah, but supermassive games, as in the group

1545
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:47,440
that did the quarry is going to be working on a game

1546
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,080
with their subsidiary, Midwinter Entertainment,

1547
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:55,640
doing a new game in the Dead by Daylight universe.

1548
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:02,160
It's a single player interactive story that will sit

1549
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,080
sit very well with the lore of Dead by Daylight,

1550
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,480
even though half the lore contradicts itself, but whatever.

1551
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,920
So you will have a team of up to four players

1552
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,120
going into a different area in the in the entities realm.

1553
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,960
And, you know, I'm guessing sort of like

1554
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,600
maybe like left for dead ish is kind of my thought. Yeah.

1555
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:32,040
But I, I, I really like it, although I think that having something

1556
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:36,440
kind of like the quarry in Dead by Daylight universe would be also cool as well.

1557
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,920
As to be awesome. I as soon as that was announced,

1558
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,880
I got a text from our pal Shane, who, you know, he's usually pretty.

1559
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,160
Yeah. Oh, is he? He was usually pretty whatever about Dead by Daylight.

1560
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,840
But yeah, when the supermassive thing was announced, he's like, all right,

1561
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,880
I guess I have to be interested in Dead by Daylight now,

1562
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,760
because supermassive is making a game about it.

1563
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,600
And I'm like, honestly, there's a ton of original characters.

1564
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,040
It makes that's actually how I heard about it,

1565
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,640
because I wasn't able to watch the thing live.

1566
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,920
Oh, yeah, Shane is in chat.

1567
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,680
Supermassive game is what will get me interested in DVD,

1568
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,160
which is crazy, since DVD has a good amount of characters I love already.

1569
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,640
I wouldn't expect the licensed characters get over into the supermassive game,

1570
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,280
but like it's got a lot of interesting characters in it,

1571
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,200
especially in the survivor side of things.

1572
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,480
I mean, some of the killers are very like, like to me, like Billy is like,

1573
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,120
because they didn't have Leatherface license yet. So they made.

1574
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:31,520
So some of it's very derivative, but some of some of the killers are really cool.

1575
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,040
Well, and of course, that also leads

1576
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,880
to the mini game in Dead by Daylight when you hear a chainsaw.

1577
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,080
Which one is it? Yeah, right.

1578
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,800
But but yeah, I kind of have have a feeling that it would be like

1579
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,080
the first for, you know, Dwight, Meg,

1580
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,000
Jake and Claudette. Yeah.

1581
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,360
As as the four and, you know, being,

1582
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,920
quote, the first, I'd say, group together in the fog. Yep.

1583
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,800
You know, and there's a fanfic I actually super like,

1584
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,520
I'll just touch on it for a second and someone fixie, it's that fanfic

1585
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:12,240
where they talk in this fix, like little headcanon thing.

1586
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:17,280
They had that when you meet somebody in a match

1587
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,440
and bring them out with you, that they can join your campfire.

1588
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,640
And that that's how, you know, even people who had been there for a while,

1589
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,120
how they eventually came to meet each other.

1590
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:35,360
And so I kind of like that idea and adapting that into this game,

1591
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,760
that they were like the first people to meet up and actually be a team.

1592
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,760
I guess it wasn't the supermassive game,

1593
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,760
but the other game you were talking about, like the the more sci fi.

1594
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,560
No, no, no. The other DBD spinoff game that they're making

1595
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,000
that sounded like it was about the survivors or excuse me,

1596
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,000
like not the folks in the entity,

1597
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,280
but the families and friends of people that have been abducted

1598
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:02,160
by the entity looking for them, that that's like the plot of that game.

1599
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:10,000
That sounds like a neat concept for a game, too.

1600
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,960
So where was this from?

1601
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,840
I don't know. No, no, no.

1602
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,280
It's it's a legit thing that they announced. I don't remember.

1603
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,720
I haven't seen that. Dang it.

1604
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,320
Let me see.

1605
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,360
Sorry, if you can hear my typing coming through.

1606
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,960
I have a life left because I'll just be doing nothing but playing all of this.

1607
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,080
OK, OK. Supermassive is making the quarry

1608
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:38,040
is making the single player adventure game like,

1609
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,360
but you mentioned midwinter entertainment.

1610
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:45,120
They are making the other game, the PVE co-op game that is its own thing.

1611
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,080
So these are two separate games.

1612
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,840
By the way, I put the picture of Julie as the skib on.

1613
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,800
And of course, her knife is like a tanto. I love it.

1614
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,000
The other, by the way, the other characters getting the treatment

1615
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,720
from Nakamura-san is the oni.

1616
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,880
He's getting sort of like the classic ghost where

1617
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,760
he's got the candles attached to his head.

1618
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:12,000
For anyone who ever watch Ranma and Nibu no Ichi, it's like Ghost and Coogie.

1619
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,920
And then Yui is getting sort of like a semi posh exercisey look.

1620
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,480
It's like Yui's day off, I guess.

1621
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,320
But anyway, yeah, I thought Yui's getting new cosmetics, too.

1622
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,000
So, yeah, there's a lot of exciting stuff going on in Dead by Daylight.

1623
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,800
I know we talk about this game a lot because we play it a lot,

1624
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,160
but I'll say one other quick thing about it and then we'll move on to other games

1625
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:40,040
because there was a comment that came up in chat and hooked on you on consoles.

1626
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,200
Fixie brought up that, you know, Nick Cage, it's not uncommon

1627
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,960
for them to release killer or survivors by themselves.

1628
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:52,280
And actually, if you look at the roadmap,

1629
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,520
which I think Fixie had pointed out,

1630
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,840
the roadmap actually shows that there's going to be either it is it seems

1631
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,320
in this new roadmap, there is some new stuff coming out

1632
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,640
where killers or survivors are being released on their own.

1633
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,400
It actually looks like for this year,

1634
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,760
a lot of these upcoming releases are going to be solo killers or survivors,

1635
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,680
which indicates they're probably killers

1636
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,200
that don't necessarily have a memorable survivor, I hate to say it,

1637
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,840
or my hope is the survivor that's coming out on their own.

1638
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:26,080
My hope, my prayer, my demonic worshiping circle, Sidney Prescott,

1639
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,520
please let that be the survivor that's coming out on their own

1640
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,160
to finally couple with Ghostface. I hope, I hope.

1641
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,840
But it's not the same Ghostface unless they do like

1642
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,120
like another skin that would be...

1643
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,680
They could, yeah, do another skin or I don't think anybody's going to care.

1644
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,040
I mean, maybe the Laura Piris will, fine.

1645
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,840
But like put Nev and Sidney, they could...

1646
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,280
I don't think that Nev has signed off on that, on her likeness.

1647
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,160
They could, I could also honestly, and this would be a little bit cheaper,

1648
01:27:59,160 --> 01:27:59,840
but they could do it.

1649
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,640
But I could see them doing the sisters from five and six,

1650
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,120
Jenny Ortega, and I can't remember the other gal's name,

1651
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,240
but I could see them doing them as survivors as kind of a

1652
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,680
the Freddy character we got was Quentin.

1653
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,880
Oh, that would be my other pick.

1654
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,680
Heather Logenkamp from Freddy would be a great solo survivor.

1655
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,880
Yeah. Although, although if they bring out Nancy,

1656
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,440
I want a freaking Alice skin, OK?

1657
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,280
Alice was the best. She kicked way more ass.

1658
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,960
I'm talking about original Nancy.

1659
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,320
Yeah. And Shane points out the franchise is moving on from Nev's character.

1660
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,600
So it'd also be weird at this point,

1661
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,600
not necessarily because we get classic character releases sometimes,

1662
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,800
but I could absolutely see them doing the sisters from the newer movies.

1663
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,960
As far as solo killers,

1664
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,920
it's funny that somebody brought up the Babadook because actually I,

1665
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:57,400
I think the community would go fucking wild if for Pride Month,

1666
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,280
they announced the Babadook as a new killer. I'm sorry.

1667
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,960
Like people would go crazy. I think that would be incredible.

1668
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,960
I have no idea what the powers would be or anything, but they'll make,

1669
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,760
they'll figure out a way. They will. I also, I'm still hoping someday Penny,

1670
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,920
I know we have a clown already, but we don't have Pennywise from it.

1671
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,440
And that's, that's the killer I most want to see. License.

1672
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,360
Fixie brought up Candyman and that's actually been a rumor for like the last

1673
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:27,360
three years because the original actor posted that he was working with behavior

1674
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,200
on something.

1675
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,960
Oh, that's, of course. And that would make a lot of sense for,

1676
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,480
honestly probably doesn't have a survivor with it.

1677
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,880
And then B. Morrie.

1678
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,560
Oh man. That'd be great.

1679
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:44,680
People have been begging or, or pumpkin head maybe.

1680
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:49,120
But I don't know. You know who I think actually should be the killer?

1681
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,760
Kathleen Turner, a serial mom.

1682
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,840
Hell yes to that. Hell yes to that. Beverly Sutphin.

1683
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:04,160
But it needs, it needs Mink Stole as the cousin or whoever is,

1684
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:08,800
or the neighbor that's on the phone. You know, did you just say pussy willows?

1685
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,360
Anyway. All right. Moving on, moving on. Uh, Loki,

1686
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,000
you get to take us away from Dead by Daylight. Bring up,

1687
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,480
let's get back to news from this week. So Loki,

1688
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,640
what happened in gaming this week?

1689
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,640
So this week, uh, Daedric or yeah, Daedalic, um,

1690
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:31,520
Entertainment had released the game Lord of the Rings

1691
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,280
Gullum and apparently it was garbage.

1692
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,000
It's another game and another, another garbage game. Um,

1693
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,840
there's lots of bugs, lots of, uh,

1694
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,560
graphic glitches and whatnot. Um,

1695
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,000
it's got bad UI that looks horrible. Um,

1696
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:53,320
it just plays like garbage and yeah, so apparently,

1697
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,480
oh, and it was a $70 game by the way. Um, so they,

1698
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:01,400
of course put out an apology as you do nowadays.

1699
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,240
As this tradition with the white text on a black background and all the,

1700
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,800
and all the works. Yep. Yep. Yep. Dear players,

1701
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,080
we would like to seriously or sincerely apologize for the underwhelming

1702
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,680
experience many of you had with the Lord of the Rings Gullum upon its release.

1703
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,840
We acknowledge and deeply regret that the game did not meet your,

1704
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,880
meet the expectations we set for ourselves for dedicated community. Yeah.

1705
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,240
But you knew that when you released it. So, uh,

1706
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,040
we please accept our sincere apologies.

1707
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:34,560
Our goal is to, well, let's see, are they going to fix it?

1708
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,920
Our development team has been working diligently to address bugs and technical

1709
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,920
issues. Many of you have experienced,

1710
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,800
we are committed to providing you with patches that will allow you to enjoy the

1711
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,640
game to its fullest potential. You know,

1712
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,040
how about you do that before the game comes out? You know, like how about, um,

1713
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,200
we look at say, tears of the kingdom, you know,

1714
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,960
they've delayed that game by a year to do extra polishing and stuff,

1715
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:01,760
and now you guys are just rushing the stuff out and this isn't the first game.

1716
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,120
This is like not even the first game within the last month that has done this.

1717
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:05,960
So

1718
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:13,040
I don't know. I don't know. Stop pre-ordering games. There you go.

1719
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,120
You can do that. Yeah. Right. Just stop pre-ordering games. Uh,

1720
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:21,520
and this is why people do that. So, um, yeah. Um,

1721
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,600
especially $70 games, like it's like, it runs awful.

1722
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:30,800
But like the fact that you're saying, well, we need $70 for this game, $70.

1723
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,160
Once again, when I hear a $70 price tag for a game,

1724
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,760
I have a $70 level of expectation for that. And I'm,

1725
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,120
I'm tired of people saying, well,

1726
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,920
games were more expensive when I was younger and stuff like that,

1727
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,560
like on the super Nintendo and stuff like that. Yeah. But the, you,

1728
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,200
you forget that that's just the sticker out the door sticker.

1729
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,320
You also forget that there's all the game passes. There's the season passes.

1730
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:58,440
There's different battle passes, different DLC.

1731
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:03,440
That was not something that was in available when you had $89

1732
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,840
games at, you know, you retailers there for like Street

1733
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,120
Fire 2 or something like that.

1734
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:12,480
So you have to remember, even though it's just it,

1735
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,640
it's just not, um,

1736
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,240
it's just not comfortable.

1737
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,680
You can't really draw a comparison from that.

1738
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:28,680
Actually, when I bought Killer Instinct in 1995 for 60 bucks,

1739
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,240
that's like 120 bucks today. Yeah.

1740
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,920
So 70 now is actually

1741
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,240
less than what I would have spent for that then.

1742
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,600
And even with DLC and everything,

1743
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:47,040
how many games are you going to pay double the money of the original game?

1744
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,600
Well, OK, never mind. I played Dead by Daylight. Never mind.

1745
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,840
I'm I'm also like, I'm just sick of studios putting out these types of

1746
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:59,320
notices that we see here on stream and that Loki just read for us when, like,

1747
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,800
they knew the game was of a certain quality when it releases.

1748
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,440
It was it was these boardroom decisions and investor decisions and,

1749
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:12,040
you know, executive decisions to release the game,

1750
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,400
despite the fact that they know it's not in a great condition.

1751
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,280
And for once, can I also say this for once?

1752
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,400
I would like to see a company put out one of these notices

1753
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,720
that just get to the fucking point, release this. This is it.

1754
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,080
That's the note we need to see.

1755
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,240
Sorry, we fucked up that. That's it.

1756
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,360
Like spare me all of these other words and say that you're really sorry

1757
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,280
that you fucked up.

1758
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,040
Yeah, because half the time when they have these roadmaps

1759
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:44,560
to fix their games and it's it's always a roadmap like you can clearly see

1760
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,560
that they needed at least six months to a year's worth of more

1761
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,840
development time, but they want to recoup some of their money or whatever.

1762
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:56,920
But like half the time, they don't even bother with fixing everything

1763
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:59,120
that's been broken with it.

1764
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:03,640
Or that pushes off like other like DLC plans and stuff that you may have had.

1765
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,200
So you buy the game.

1766
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,080
Oh, cool. I'll get this extra content in a month.

1767
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,800
Oh, well, no, I can't because they screwed up a bunch of stuff

1768
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,200
when they were developing the game.

1769
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:14,520
And now we have to wait another year before we even see any of that.

1770
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,280
Shane wants to point out in chat,

1771
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,840
OG Killer Instinct is still worth one hundred and twenty bucks

1772
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,720
for the soundtrack alone.

1773
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,760
I mean, I have to have two copies of the soundtrack. Fair.

1774
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,640
Killer Cuts.

1775
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:31,080
Killer Cuts. Yeah, it had like some really weird versions

1776
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,640
of some of the stuff, though.

1777
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:36,040
Dejirama says seventy dollars and still no instruction booklet.

1778
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,360
Amen to that.

1779
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,240
Bring those back.

1780
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,920
All right. Let's see. Let's move on.

1781
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,440
Oh, another company had a gaming showcase this week.

1782
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,040
It wasn't PlayStation, though, but it was another studio

1783
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,680
that makes some games that,

1784
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,120
you know, I think folks around here probably played a few of these.

1785
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,640
And that is Marvelous.

1786
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:58,680
Marvelous Entertainment did a showcase this week of some games.

1787
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,680
It was about a 30 minute showcase where they talked about games like

1788
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:05,880
Fashion Dreamer, which is a game of the Nintendo Switch fashion game.

1789
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,680
I believe it's actually been shown in some of the Nintendo directs.

1790
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,120
So this isn't totally new news.

1791
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:14,560
Project Magia, a new frontier is coming out as well.

1792
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:20,880
Project Life, which is a brand new IP that is influenced from Japanese RPGs.

1793
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,040
And then Story of Seasons will continue.

1794
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,920
There is another installment for Story of Seasons.

1795
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,000
I know some people were really into that on Switch.

1796
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,600
So that is going to get a new game as well.

1797
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:35,320
Rune Factory getting a spin off project called Project Dragon

1798
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,440
is going to be coming out as well.

1799
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,520
And then a confirmation that Rune Factory 6 is underway,

1800
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:43,280
but nothing else to say beyond that right now.

1801
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,440
And the last game they showed, or didn't show as the case may be,

1802
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:53,560
was Daemon Demon Cross Machina Titanic Scion.

1803
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,240
That is being produced by Marvelous's first studio

1804
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:03,160
and being helmed by producer Kenichiro Tsurakuta.

1805
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:07,200
It is a third person mech shooter series coming out.

1806
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,600
I don't know if this is a mech game on your radar, Loki,

1807
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,200
but that is something that you can check out.

1808
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:12,880
It is not.

1809
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:13,440
All right.

1810
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,000
OK, so that was Marvelous.

1811
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,400
DJRomaS in chat says, Ah, Marvelous.

1812
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,480
They be hitting with some niche anime games at times.

1813
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,480
That is exactly what these folks are known for.

1814
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,600
And I know these games are up some of y'all's alley.

1815
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,920
So that's why I mention it.

1816
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,520
No One Special in chat says,

1817
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:33,320
Does Marvelous Games have any relation to Marvelous Entertainment,

1818
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,240
who is behind some anime series?

1819
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:38,360
And DJRomaS, who would know this answer better than I, says,

1820
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,320
Yes, same company.

1821
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,440
So that's good to know.

1822
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,320
All right, let's move on.

1823
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,720
Dark Sakura with an interesting update in the preservation realm.

1824
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:51,640
Yes, so there is a well,

1825
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:55,120
there was a rare Castlevania arcade machine,

1826
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:00,360
and it has been preserved so that it can be played on a PC.

1827
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,680
It is it works with a controller, but you originally,

1828
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:09,160
I think, had like a whip controller that you would use.

1829
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:14,960
And it's just it was a neat game.

1830
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,960
But of course, it was Akuma Joe Dracula.

1831
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,040
The arcade is what the name was.

1832
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,920
So Demon Castle Dracula.

1833
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,400
But in progress, there's a

1834
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,360
Discord server that I think that has the information on it.

1835
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:36,480
But I mean, this was like you can play it with a mouse.

1836
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,640
You play it with a remote to use the whip mechanic.

1837
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:43,800
But it is considered the rarest in the series

1838
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:48,560
because of just how few of them that they made for Japan and even less for US.

1839
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,080
So there is a sorry,

1840
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,560
video has a link to download it.

1841
01:38:55,880 --> 01:39:00,080
And so what I will do is I will get the YouTube video link

1842
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,640
and post it in chat.

1843
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,640
And sorry, some of the audio leaked through there.

1844
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,240
I try to mute YouTube so that they all stay muted.

1845
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,720
But sometimes for whatever reason, it resets.

1846
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,600
Yeah, I'm playing the video live on stream here.

1847
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,240
So because honestly, I feel like I saw this like one time.

1848
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:18,480
Go ahead.

1849
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,920
It was automatically playing for me and I was telling it to stop.

1850
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,480
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1851
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,680
So but yeah, this is this is definitely like

1852
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:29,240
a piece of Castlevania history that most people probably forgot.

1853
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,520
So that's really cool that they got that working, to be honest.

1854
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,960
So good for them.

1855
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,640
All right, let's I'm pretty, pretty happy.

1856
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,800
Yeah, I want to check that out at some point, for sure.

1857
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:42,400
Let's see.

1858
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,920
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I saw this only once at a convention.

1859
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,360
Dr. Tzuyu says the music is cool,

1860
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:52,040
but from what I understand, sound effects aren't working yet.

1861
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,160
They'll get there.

1862
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,080
This reminds me of when they were emulating MAME stuff in the early days,

1863
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:00,280
like a lot of stuff took some time to get right and get the

1864
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,560
get all the sound and stuff, but very interesting.

1865
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,280
All right.

1866
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,240
This is kind of some surprising news, Loki, in the industry.

1867
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,800
This is almost a little weird, I'd say.

1868
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,880
I feel like this isn't being talked about enough for the volume of what this is.

1869
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,800
So apparently and it's still very vague, too,

1870
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,360
because we don't know why partnership was with.

1871
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:26,040
But apparently the Embracer group said that a two billion dollar

1872
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,760
partnership deal that they had with some other mysterious company

1873
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,240
has fallen apart now as of this week.

1874
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:36,960
And so apparently the collapse of the mega deal,

1875
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,200
the partner, which has not been revealed, was expected.

1876
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:43,040
Embracer said they had a verbal commitment in October

1877
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,240
and described negotiations as taking far longer than expected.

1878
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,520
Their shares were down 40 percent.

1879
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:53,120
And of course, you know, they're they're not happy about that.

1880
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,160
They said it's been a rough night.

1881
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,600
But hey, this is business.

1882
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,000
So cool.

1883
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,600
There's I mean, there's I'm curious to see what that was about.

1884
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,880
Were they looking for an acquisition or something?

1885
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,760
Like, were they expecting, you know, two billion dollar investment?

1886
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,680
A two billion dollar investment.

1887
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,880
That's like this was something major.

1888
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:26,040
And the fact that it was being taught, they had a verbal agreement

1889
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:29,760
and this mystery company backed out of a verbal agreement.

1890
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,920
Now, granted, you can do that. It's not a legal agreement.

1891
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:33,440
It's not a binding thing.

1892
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:37,520
But whatever transpired between the verbal agreement

1893
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,640
and now whether it was a prototype, I'm assuming there was a prototype

1894
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:43,440
of some sort that was come together in a couple of months.

1895
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,480
And it must have been so bad, at least to the rights holder,

1896
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,480
that they decided to walk away from a two billion dollar deal like this.

1897
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:55,440
I mean, the thing is something of that magnitude.

1898
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,520
This could have ramifications on Embracer Group that are very bad.

1899
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,880
And for a studio that's been really trying to build themselves

1900
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:05,440
with the portfolio over time and stuff, this this is

1901
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,200
this is just not good.

1902
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,600
And the fact that the CEO is being as transparent as this,

1903
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,840
which is in part a relief,

1904
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:18,400
but also like very rarely a side that you hear about in games.

1905
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,960
I mean, things get canceled all the time.

1906
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,200
Agreements get broken all the time.

1907
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,160
I don't know if it's at this stage all the time,

1908
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,000
but there are things that happen a lot.

1909
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,040
Something of this magnitude.

1910
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,400
This is huge.

1911
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,160
And so it's it's going to have ramifications on Embracer Group's future.

1912
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:44,200
And I think we're all dying to know who the fuck stood them up majorly here.

1913
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:48,040
And but well, it's going to take time.

1914
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,440
It will come out eventually.

1915
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,680
It always does.

1916
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:54,040
Somebody on the inside will leak it eventually.

1917
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:56,520
But it's going to take some time for that to come out.

1918
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,560
DJ Rama S says, Wasn't Tomb Raider involved in this deal?

1919
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,960
No, this is a different deal.

1920
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,760
But Embracer happens to have Tomb Raider.

1921
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,640
Yeah, they already own Tomb Raider.

1922
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:09,880
So no, it's not involved in that.

1923
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:13,680
Yeah, unless it was something about making the games exclusive.

1924
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:17,520
I don't think that I don't think they said I think they said the deal was a new game.

1925
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,800
They were going to be investing in like two billion dollars in a new game,

1926
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,360
which makes me think it was definitely something on the scope of like an always

1927
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:27,840
online, always connected type of stuff or franchise or something.

1928
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:31,120
I don't know. Yeah, we'll never know.

1929
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:40,520
All right, let's move on to our next story and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

1930
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:45,200
But first, I've got this story, which is about, of course, Diablo four is on its way.

1931
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:51,040
And Diablo four is doing a partnership again with Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1932
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:56,560
And through this promotion, you can get some very special cosmetics.

1933
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:02,480
So last time it was entry into the closed beta or whatever, you know, the preorder only beta.

1934
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:10,320
This time, the promo period from May 29th, apparently, which is tomorrow.

1935
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:14,480
So I'm not hearing if that's finalized yet through July 2nd.

1936
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:20,640
But certainly around the time this game comes out, you'll be able to earn five special in-game rewards.

1937
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,440
They are weapons because there's five classes in the game.

1938
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:30,120
So they are five weapons, including things like the Dread Pheasant Slayer for you.

1939
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,120
Get it? Pheasants, chickens.

1940
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,080
That's something you can get for your rogue.

1941
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:38,640
You can also get the Vessel of the Eleven, which is for your druid.

1942
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,240
Get it? Eleven herbs and spices.

1943
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:44,000
That's stupid.

1944
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:48,000
This is colossally stupid, but I kind of love it.

1945
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,400
No, the best pun, the best pun of them all.

1946
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,040
Hold on. I'm going to bring this up on the other screen because it's one of those things you have to see it to believe it.

1947
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,320
All right. You ready? You ready?

1948
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:01,320
The best pun of them all, the Foul Reaper.

1949
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,840
I quit, I'm done by.

1950
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:06,320
Logging off.

1951
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:07,800
That's awesome.

1952
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:14,160
I'm so glad I hate the collab, but I like I like how I like that.

1953
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:14,760
They leaned into it.

1954
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,040
I'm glad. Yeah, exactly.

1955
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,920
Exactly. They're leaning into it.

1956
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:25,960
Now, that said, while while cringy as it is, it's still not up to the magnum opus.

1957
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,160
That was the cup noodle.

1958
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:37,760
It's really, you know, cross Final Fantasy 15 like that was just that's just that's just a level of amazement that we'll never, ever see again in this life.

1959
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:41,640
Look, you you all wondered what Intern Drew is up to these days.

1960
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,040
I'm very glad he got a job.

1961
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:48,400
Very glad that he got a job at KFC's marketing department.

1962
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,320
Side job.

1963
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,120
Well, I mean, yeah, because he and I are co-workers.

1964
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,600
Don't ruin the fun. Stop ruining the fun.

1965
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,480
All right. All right.

1966
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,880
Well, let's let's have some fun with a classic segment.

1967
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,960
I don't know what I like to do here on Orange Lounge Radio, but I will let the bump say the rest.

1968
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:25,520
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1969
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,680
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1970
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,520
All right, DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?

1971
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,560
While I get the b-roll queued up here.

1972
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,480
I know you're going to laugh because I did it just for you.

1973
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:45,400
I know. Honestly, it was one of those things when you when I saw this, I was like, wait, one of those nights that DarkSakura wasn't here.

1974
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,280
I never picked this game.

1975
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,760
How is that possible?

1976
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,600
Because you must be psycho and have ESPN.

1977
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,520
I guess. All right.

1978
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,080
So what is the classic game of the week?

1979
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:00,800
It's Diablo. The Diablo.

1980
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,680
The one and only.

1981
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,720
Without without a numerical modifier.

1982
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,880
So Diablo is an action RPG that was developed by

1983
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,600
developed by Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment.

1984
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:21,320
It came out in July 1997 and is the very first in the series.

1985
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:26,360
It is set in the kingdom of Konduras in the mortal realm.

1986
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,880
And you play a hero who works to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror,

1987
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:37,560
and then you fight through randomly generated dungeon levels

1988
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,200
and then go to hell and then you face Diablo.

1989
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:45,040
So there were also expansion packs for this.

1990
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:51,040
And November the same year by synergistic software came Diablo Hellfire.

1991
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:55,880
And then EA did release Diablo for PlayStation.

1992
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:01,520
It was also the version was developed by Climax Studio

1993
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:04,520
and had direct control of the main character's direction

1994
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:08,560
using the PlayStation controller instead of the point and click like the original.

1995
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:12,960
There's a Sega Saturn version considered, but never released.

1996
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:17,800
It's been up there as considered one of the greatest games of all time.

1997
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,080
And of course, it's had sequels.

1998
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,400
Diablo two, Diablo three, and now Diablo four just about to come out.

1999
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:28,120
And in 2022, there was a mobile version called Diablo Immortal.

2000
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:35,640
Anywho, you in the original, of course, you point and click and go different places.

2001
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:39,520
You have actions like casting a spell with your keyboard.

2002
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:44,880
You get items, you learn spells, defeat enemies and interact with NPCs.

2003
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:50,520
The dungeons, as I said earlier, they are procedurally generated

2004
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:54,560
with themes for each level, like a catacomb with long corridors

2005
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,160
and rooms and caves are more nonlinear.

2006
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,640
And of course, different items to help you level up.

2007
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,200
So there are three character classes.

2008
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,520
You have the warrior, the rogue and the sorcerer,

2009
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,840
and each have different attributes, of course.

2010
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:17,120
And, you know, of course, like the warrior is low magic, but

2011
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,840
he can't learn the higher spells like the sorcerer can.

2012
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,600
But he's a hardcore melee guy, you know,

2013
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:27,320
and then the rogue is the mid range weapon type person.

2014
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,800
And then in Hellfire, the monk was added,

2015
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,120
who is proficient at melee with staff.

2016
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:38,200
And later on, we got the bard and the barbarian.

2017
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,920
They were actually unfinished.

2018
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,200
And but they were in.

2019
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:50,560
The game is hidden characters, and you could enable them with a little bit of hack

2020
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:54,200
and you would basically

2021
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:58,760
give the rogue and the warrior their abilities.

2022
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,240
You could get, you know, all kinds of items, white items

2023
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:07,320
were normal, blue were magic, gold were unique.

2024
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:12,920
Anything that was not one of those, they had to be identified.

2025
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:16,800
You got bows, you got blades.

2026
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:21,120
You could pay an NPC to have items restored.

2027
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:24,160
You know, just all kinds of stuff like that was fairly

2028
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:28,000
in depth. And there's multiplayer.

2029
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,160
So you get to play up to four players.

2030
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,360
The characters are saved periodically.

2031
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:38,320
And you can either be aggressive

2032
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,560
or play co-op with other players.

2033
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:46,480
You would use a modem connection or battle.net back in the day.

2034
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,520
The old battle.net

2035
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,680
or IPX network connection.

2036
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:58,120
It did not have the anti-cheats that the later characters did.

2037
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,600
So lots of people altered the characters.

2038
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:04,320
And there were lots of trainers out there using the cheat engine.

2039
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,600
But at any rate, I'm not going to go too much into the story,

2040
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,160
because honestly, if you haven't played it now, then hey.

2041
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,720
But it was conceived by David Breivik

2042
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,920
while they were developing the fighting game Justice League

2043
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:24,600
Task Force in 1995 and developed by Japanese studio Sunsoft

2044
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:28,560
with two American studios, Condor Games, which became Blizzard North

2045
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:34,560
on Sega Genesis and Silicon Snaps for SNES.

2046
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,520
So basically, he wanted to do a roguelike

2047
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,320
that had turn-based gameplay, but wanted it to have

2048
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:48,000
a quicker enhancement, quicker leveling through it.

2049
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,280
And so, you know, they also had plenty of influences in it,

2050
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:56,720
like Telengard, Legend of Zelda, Doom.

2051
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:04,920
And then Diablo was based on Mount Diablo, where Breivik lived.

2052
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,120
That's pretty cool.

2053
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,920
Just bring in your influences.

2054
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,960
The game was conceived originally to be a claymation game,

2055
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:19,760
like Clay Fighter, but they went for 3D isometrics instead.

2056
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:26,680
So Blizzard acquired Condor Games and named them to Blizzard South.

2057
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,760
And then there was Blizzard.

2058
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,240
Sorry, their Irvine location was called Blizzard South

2059
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:34,840
and Condor Games was called Blizzard North.

2060
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:38,840
And then Blizzard South was at the time working on Warcraft 2.

2061
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:46,040
This also, though, led to the development of Battle.net.

2062
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:54,160
So to keep going on, the music for Diablo only had six tracks.

2063
01:52:54,160 --> 01:53:00,000
It was composed by Matt Ilman and the soundtrack was released in 2011.

2064
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:05,280
Diablo would normally require the original CD to play,

2065
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,680
but there are shareware versions out there.

2066
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:14,200
It's called Diablo Spawn, and then you could unlock different things.

2067
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:20,360
And then finally, of course, there's, I believe,

2068
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:26,440
the GOG version that has some enhancements now in 2019.

2069
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:29,840
They didn't think it was going to sell great.

2070
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,480
They thought it would be OK.

2071
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:36,920
But because of all the positive press, the estimates actually shut up.

2072
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:42,560
Their preorders surpassed 450,000 units.

2073
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:48,920
And so their original shipment of 500,000 units

2074
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:51,440
had to be staggered so that people could get their copy.

2075
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:57,200
It held number one for three months before being displaced

2076
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:01,560
by X-Wing versus TIE Fighter, which is another game I probably need to cover.

2077
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,480
But yeah, I mean, the game was very well received.

2078
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:11,800
The 94 out of 100 on Metacritic, which is pretty damn high.

2079
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,120
Not everyone liked it.

2080
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:20,000
Like, IGN gave it a 7.5 out of 10 for the PlayStation version.

2081
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:27,320
But the PC version was definitely ranked higher than the PlayStation version.

2082
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,760
The PlayStation version kind of had its issues, too.

2083
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:33,960
Like, I understand why people would rank it lower, for sure.

2084
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,360
So, like I said, there were

2085
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:42,640
expansion packs and Blizzard actually sold the world rights

2086
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:47,320
to develop, publish and distribute the console versions to EA in 1996.

2087
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,600
So that's when, in 1998,

2088
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:55,520
the PlayStation version came out that had no online play.

2089
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:58,360
It had a two-player co-op mode.

2090
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,200
But there were new lighting effects, auto-aimings for weapons,

2091
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:05,200
an option for increased game speed.

2092
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:09,280
And the weird thing is that it doesn't support the PlayStation mouse.

2093
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:16,360
There was a PAL release that was dubbed into French and German and Swedish.

2094
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,640
And then, of course,

2095
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:24,760
the 1998 Blizzard Game of the Year collection contained

2096
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:27,000
Diablo, StarCraft and Warcraft II.

2097
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:31,000
And then the anthology that came out in 2000 included

2098
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,480
Diablo, StarCraft, StarCraft Brood War, Warcraft II Battle.net Edition.

2099
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:40,200
And so, yeah, there's just been like a bajillion releases overall.

2100
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,320
And then for the 20th anniversary at BlizzCon,

2101
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,440
this is in 2016,

2102
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:49,400
Diablo III would receive a patch called The Darkening of Tristam

2103
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:53,600
that recreated the original game with a 16-level dungeon,

2104
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:58,040
four main bosses from the 1997 one and special graphic filters,

2105
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,440
eight directional limited speed like the original.

2106
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:06,200
They did a test patch and then the public test realm,

2107
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,800
and then they had it in there.

2108
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,720
So you can still get the game on GOG.

2109
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:14,240
There's two versions.

2110
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:18,120
There's the original 1996 version and a DirectX-based version

2111
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:23,480
built in-house by GOG that has extra display and graphical options.

2112
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:28,400
So that is your game, Diablo.

2113
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:32,640
Great pick, and I really can't state

2114
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,400
how many hours I lost in college

2115
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:38,880
on Battle.net playing this game,

2116
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,960
because you were talking about some of the multiplayer stuff in there.

2117
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,440
And this is this is an epic game to be playing on Battle.net,

2118
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:47,680
because, you know, this is in the era of like Doom and Quake

2119
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,760
and those same games are coming out.

2120
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,400
But I was never good at the first person shooters.

2121
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,440
But this this is definitely more my jam.

2122
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:56,080
But it's it's weird because it's this is a really hard game

2123
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,440
to go back and play now.

2124
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:02,600
Like I've picked it up on GOG and the Diablo III integrations cute.

2125
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,160
But, you know, it's still Diablo III basically with Diablo levels.

2126
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:08,680
But I picked it up on GOG and I tried to go back and play it.

2127
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:10,080
And it's it's it's hard.

2128
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,640
It's even hard to play Diablo II now, honestly.

2129
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:18,840
But obviously without it, you know, I think there's so many ARPGs,

2130
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:22,920
action based RPGs that owe so much to Diablo that we just you know,

2131
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,560
we wouldn't we wouldn't have these games without Diablo.

2132
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:28,360
So. Yeah, great pick.

2133
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:33,160
All right. Of course you do.

2134
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,400
All right. We're going to get to some rapid fire news

2135
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,840
and then some world release dates.

2136
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,520
And then we're going to open it up to you all

2137
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,400
who might want to participate with the show tonight

2138
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:44,280
over on our Discord over at vog network dot com slash discord.

2139
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,760
Or I'm going to see as well.

2140
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,320
Maybe we have some tweets tonight.

2141
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:48,600
I don't know if we had emails.

2142
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:51,120
I don't think I saw any come in, but we'll see.

2143
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,320
But let's get to the rapid fire news first.

2144
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,880
Loki. Yeah.

2145
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,200
So they have a brand new Lego set that's super exciting.

2146
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,120
It is kind of cool.

2147
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:02,960
It is a Pac-Man bar top cabinet.

2148
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:04,640
This looks fucking rad.

2149
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:08,240
And it's pretty sweet because they actually have like elements

2150
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:12,040
on the game of the play field to actually move around

2151
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:13,920
when you like turn a crank and stuff.

2152
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,240
Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.

2153
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:20,560
Like this is actually, I think, up to the level of like the Lego

2154
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,720
and Nintendo Entertainment System that they did.

2155
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,600
The twenty six hundred one wasn't as great, but this one looks really cool.

2156
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,520
So that is going to be out.

2157
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,680
I don't know when it's actually out here.

2158
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,880
Oh, June 4th.

2159
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,240
For two hundred and seventy dollars.

2160
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:40,640
It looks really cool, I think.

2161
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:46,080
I mean, they started that whole sort of live element with the Nintendo.

2162
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:48,720
Yeah, so that was pretty cool.

2163
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,560
Yeah, looks cool.

2164
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,520
So I have to check it out.

2165
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:56,480
And then, of course, so we have Super Mario Advance

2166
01:58:56,480 --> 01:59:01,720
now joining Nintendo Switch online, so they've added that as well as

2167
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:07,680
what was it, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance three and Super Mario World

2168
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:12,680
Mario Advance two, which, you know, those are just ports of the other games.

2169
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:17,160
So. Cool. All right.

2170
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,600
I'm excited about that.

2171
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:24,680
Yeah. Yeah. Well, for another little

2172
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:28,640
teensy bit of news is that the most evil of all Tetris games,

2173
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:31,440
which is Tetris, the absolute Grandmaster two plus,

2174
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:36,400
it will be showing up on the switch via the Arcade Archives

2175
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,360
collection starting on June 1st.

2176
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:41,040
And yeah, be prepared to cry.

2177
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,120
It's painful. It is.

2178
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:48,880
All right. And I've seen people beat like do tournaments on that.

2179
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,080
And oh, my God. Well, I mean, just don't blink.

2180
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,080
It is summer games done quick season.

2181
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,720
So we have to bring up our old pal Kevin DDR, who,

2182
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,520
you know, was there a few years doing Grandmaster

2183
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:02,160
and showed us all how it was done, for sure.

2184
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:08,160
All right. Speaking of summer season, it's also time almost for summer game fest.

2185
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,320
Of course, we know that without E3,

2186
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,640
this is kind of going to be one of the press events we are getting.

2187
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,440
It is going to be, of course, on June 8th.

2188
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:16,640
We know all this already.

2189
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,600
What's the new stuff we're getting this week?

2190
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:24,760
Word from Jeff Keighley that the live show will feature three or four things

2191
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:27,200
that are, quote, pretty big for this audience.

2192
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,040
I think that's I think that's living in Vagueville.

2193
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:34,600
I think the thought of six.

2194
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,080
Yeah. Yeah, right.

2195
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,200
Pretty big is also a very relative thing, right?

2196
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:42,760
Like Elden Ring was a huge fucking deal to a lot of people.

2197
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:47,280
But there's other people that were like, you know, so I think it's it's very.

2198
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:51,200
You know, relative, but I think it's going to

2199
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,200
I'm excited to see what they come up with, for sure.

2200
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:56,440
So. All right.

2201
02:00:58,280 --> 02:01:01,120
We'll see at the event

2202
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:05,320
on June 8th, which is less than two weeks away at this point.

2203
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:10,560
Yes, it's going to start ramping up these next few weeks, that's for sure.

2204
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:11,600
That's for sure.

2205
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:14,000
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some games

2206
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,400
that are coming out this week.

2207
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,800
Here we are. We're getting the big releases, right, Loki?

2208
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,360
Only one of them, though, remember, because the other one's

2209
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:23,720
actually two weeks from now.

2210
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:26,520
So we have Etrian Odyssey

02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:48,960
System Shock on PC. Oh, yeah.

2216
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,240
That's yeah. That reboot. Yeah. Yeah.

02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:57,960

2226
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:43,200
on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

2227
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,680
I forgot you're right.

2228
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:49,920
Diablo four is technically two weeks because the early access is this week.

2229
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,920
So technically, yes, it's two weeks.

2230
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,520
But, you know, the the crazies like me will be playing it a little early.

2231
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:00,520
All right. But I'm sure it look either you're playing

2232
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:03,680
Diablo four or you're playing Street Fighter six this weekend.

2233
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:07,040
Like it's a big weekend for games or maybe the Katamari rerelease

2234
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:08,440
sounds pretty good, too.

2235
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:10,560
There's a lot of good stuff in the future.

2236
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:13,520
All right. Well, let's travel over to Japan where you have a lot of overlap

2237
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,440
as well. And we have a week where we have big game releases coming out.

2238
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
We mentioned Marvelous earlier in the show, and they are releasing in Japan

2239
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,520
this week, Loop eight Summer of Gods on the Switch, which I believe

2240
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:25,920
we heard in the US as well.

2241
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:30,360
We love Katamari Reroll and Royal Reverie is out this week as well.

2242
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:32,960
Reverie, excuse me, is out as well in Japan this week.

2243
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:37,800
Eterion Odyssey Origins Collection is also out in Japan this week.

2244
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:42,520
And that is in a regular and a limited edition because of course it is.

2245
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:46,520
And that is it for Japan on the Switch.

2246
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,600
But let me take a look at PS5 real quick.

2247
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:51,040
Company Heroes three is out on May 30th.

2248
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:55,520
That same collection of We Love Katamari is out as well on the PlayStation five.

2249
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,600
And of course, Street Fighter six also released in Japan

2250
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:02,640
this week on the second same day as everywhere else.

2251
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,800
Speaking of everywhere else, what's going on in Europe? Dark Sakura?

2252
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,880
Oh, only a few things, really.

2253
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:13,320
We've got a killer frequency on the first,

2254
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:16,480
and that is for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

2255
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:18,760
And then the others are on the second for Switch.

2256
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:21,600
We have We Love Katamari Reroll and Royal Reverie.

2257
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,520
Try saying that really fast.

2258
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:27,520
And then on PlayStation and Xbox, we have Street Fighter six.

2259
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:32,160
Something that I actually already have on Steam

2260
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:35,520
is coming out later in the month, and that's Aka R.

2261
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:40,480
Oh. Yeah, which was originally

2262
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:43,840
a failed Atari game like like there was a proto.

2263
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:48,080
And then it's getting it has its release on Steam.

2264
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:50,800
So interesting. Very, very trippy game.

2265
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:56,400
All right. Well, we are about to the close of the show.

2266
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:59,040
We'll get some last minute stories here in a little bit.

2267
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,800
But first, we want to open up the roundtable to all of you.

2268
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:06,440
You can call in via our Discord channel in the green room over at vognetwork.com

2269
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:07,160
slash discord.

2270
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:10,720
We already have somebody in the green room waiting to be on the air.

2271
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:11,880
So why don't we bring them in?

2272
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:13,760
It's been a few weeks since we've heard from this individual.

2273
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,560
Hello. You are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2274
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,520
Hi, it's Fixation Gaze.

2275
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,280
Hey, Fixation Gaze.

2276
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:24,160
May I call you Fixie?

2277
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:27,000
Of course. How are you doing tonight, Fixie?

2278
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:28,880
Great, great.

2279
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:32,560
I just wanted to pop in to talk about something that's kind of important

2280
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:36,320
in the realm of video games, but also in the realm of video game movies.

2281
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:38,040
Oh, which one?

2282
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:38,480
Let's hear it.

2283
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:42,720
Hadn't heard much chatter in the Discord about the Iron Lung movie

2284
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,280
coming out by Mark Fischbach.

2285
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:46,240
Well, he's directing and starring in it.

2286
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:49,640
If you haven't talked about it yet, we have not.

2287
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:51,640
So please enlighten us.

2288
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:54,600
OK, so first I'm going to start off with the preface of Iron Lung,

2289
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:56,960
which was an indie game done in 2022.

2290
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:02,360
It is about basically being in a tiny submarine in an ocean

2291
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,440
of blood on a moon in a post-apocalyptic world.

2292
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,560
Oh, I remember that.

2293
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:10,280
It was played by the by Mark Fischbach,

2294
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:13,560
also known as like his better gamer tag, which is Markiplier.

2295
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,560
And he immediately fell in love with the game,

2296
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,840
reached out to the indie developer, which is David.

2297
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:23,960
I'm going to butcher this last name.

2298
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,520
Oh, gosh, where is it?

2299
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,080
Now I know where I heard it is.

2300
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:28,000
I heard this.

2301
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,520
I heard this is the Markiplier connection.

2302
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,680
Yeah, Skamansky, I think.

2303
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:34,200
Skamansky. Yeah.

2304
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:37,520
And so Markiplier recently

2305
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:41,280
released a trailer for the movie,

2306
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:45,160
which he has already finished filming. Wow.

2307
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:50,960
Yeah. And he I'm expecting a lot out of this,

2308
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,040
considering I don't know if you guys have seen his other work,

2309
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:58,360
such as In Space with Markiplier, which almost won him an Emmy.

2310
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,720
He was Emmy nominated for that.

2311
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:03,480
The Death of Markiplier,

2312
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:07,520
which was also like his kind of branch out into making this sort of content.

2313
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:11,880
But he is now kind of severeing

2314
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:16,280
harder into the movie instead of the action adventure

2315
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:21,360
sort of click story mode he did, where you could pick different options to go on.

2316
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:26,680
But now he is fully immersed into the movie creation,

2317
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,320
which is one of the passions that he has mentioned for his his newer projects,

2318
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:34,920
which I'm super excited to see him make more movies. Hmm.

2319
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:37,840
And for the record, if you want the game on Steam,

2320
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:40,160
the deluxe edition is under seven bucks.

2321
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:42,120
Oh, yeah, it's an incredible game.

2322
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:46,720
It's very affordable for the absolute terror it brings.

2323
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,600
For the fact that Mark played it once and then was like, I need to make a movie.

2324
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:54,080
I think it's yeah, I think it's also fascinating

2325
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:56,640
how we've gone from like YouTube personality

2326
02:07:56,640 --> 02:08:00,800
to like now taking on Hollywood, like literally YouTube taking on Hollywood.

2327
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,920
And I know we've kind of talked about this for for years now,

2328
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:07,400
about the hours that people spend watching YouTube or say things like Twitch

2329
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:10,280
or other type of content online versus, you know,

2330
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:14,440
how much people are watching cable and, you know, movies

2331
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:17,600
and streaming services and so forth. This is very interesting to me,

2332
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,760
this pivot and how he's going to be able to

2333
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:24,880
mobilize his audience to support something like that

2334
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:28,640
and what kind of profit it can ultimately make versus Hollywood.

2335
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:33,360
What's really surprising is he actually has mentioned his issues with Hollywood

2336
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,880
and with because he he was I mentioned he's Emmy nominated. Right.

2337
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:39,280
He went to the red carpet.

2338
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:43,280
He was on the red carpet and he commented like not saying it in a narcissistic way,

2339
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:48,080
but that nobody talked to him because they didn't care nor knew who he was.

2340
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:51,560
He made something that was far longer

2341
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:54,800
than a movie in space with Markiplier, if you haven't seen it.

2342
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:59,160
It's, you know, a choice game where you can go on several endings

2343
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:02,520
through several different like timelines based off of your choices

2344
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,760
in which video you press, which choices you make.

2345
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:12,400
And it was an incredible feat for for acting, for effects.

2346
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:15,880
It was like watching a movie that was 10 hours long. Huh.

2347
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,760
And you could keep it had replayability

2348
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:21,440
because you could find a new ending, you could find a secret.

2349
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:23,160
It was a whole thing.

2350
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:24,560
And it got him Emmy nominated.

2351
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,880
And nobody cared about this new evolution in movie making.

2352
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:30,640
Nobody thought, huh, what if we took this

2353
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:33,640
and we made it like an in-depth thing for our movies?

2354
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,440
What if choices like we could do voting in movie theaters

2355
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:38,640
to see how something would end?

2356
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,760
But instead, they kind of flatlined

2357
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:44,880
when it came to actually talking to him or networking with him.

2358
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:49,120
And so now he has a lot more passion towards making a movie

2359
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:51,040
because he wants that to be recognized.

2360
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:54,200
He doesn't want YouTube or Twitch streamers to be sidelined

2361
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:57,840
for Hollywood celebrities and directors who are already out there.

2362
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,200
Number one, everything you're saying about this, though,

2363
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:04,680
replaced with Twin Peaks, The Return, and that's how I feel about it.

2364
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:08,280
The 10 hour TV show that was a movie based on one long movie,

2365
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:11,040
completely snubbed by the Emmys and all that stuff.

2366
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:14,400
It was a disgusting robbery of epic proportions.

2367
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:18,920
But yeah, but but on a serious note, I admire, you know, I'm going to be honest,

2368
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:21,200
I don't follow a lot of the big YouTubers.

2369
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:22,560
I'm aware of Markiplier.

2370
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,520
Everything I've heard about him is that he's one of the good guys.

2371
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:27,600
You know, a lot of people seem to be really into him and that he's

2372
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:28,640
essentially a director.

2373
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:30,640
Yeah. And essentially a pretty nice guy.

2374
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:36,600
I love that he is forcing himself into the room because

2375
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,240
and there's there's a lot of places. I mean,

2376
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:43,200
not to get all grandpa, but I'm going to for a minute, you know,

2377
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:46,560
think about when podcasting first came, first,

2378
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:51,920
think about when podcasting first rolled out and this whole show and how we had

2379
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:56,440
to insert ourselves into the conversation because people weren't

2380
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:01,120
like willing to take this whole emerging thing seriously, right?

2381
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:04,520
Like people don't want to take podcasts seriously because we weren't an

2382
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:07,080
established magazine or, you know, things like that. Now,

2383
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:10,440
not that I'm trying to put us on the same scale as Markiplier. However,

2384
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:15,480
what I am saying is that I have a respect for somebody who is forcing their way

2385
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:20,400
into the conversation, whether Hollywood is ready for it or not.

2386
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:22,920
I think that's great. And I wish him luck. I really do.

2387
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:28,720
Markiplier is a fascinating case study of somebody who has repeatedly made,

2388
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:33,000
like, I'm going to say, take for example,

2389
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,200
another thing that he did was technically like directed and, uh,

2390
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:37,680
that was Unus Annus,

2391
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:42,400
which a lot of people cast by the wayside until it was way too late because the

2392
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:43,720
entirety of Unus Annus,

2393
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:47,560
even though he was making one video every single day and he was producing those

2394
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:52,000
videos and editing those videos, same day, every day for an entire year.

2395
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:56,000
But if you actually read into it, there was a script, there was a story.

2396
02:11:56,280 --> 02:12:00,040
And sometimes you wouldn't see it cause some videos were like rooted in reality,

2397
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:01,400
but it went into a very,

2398
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:06,080
very nuanced discussion about death and about leaving your mark and about

2399
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,680
lasting longer than your life. Like what your,

2400
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,640
what is your content going to say about you in 40 years when you're gone?

2401
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:16,040
And then it was all gone, deleted because of everything eventually is gone.

2402
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:17,400
You,

2403
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:21,600
even your legacy will be gone someday and that you need to live in the present

2404
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,440
in the moment and make for yourself.

2405
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:28,280
And that was a beautiful thing that people didn't realize until it was way

2406
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:32,200
gone. And we are left with only memory of what he did.

2407
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:37,760
And that in of itself is another innovation that people are kind of

2408
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:40,840
overlooking because they go, Oh, Markiplier, he's one of the big dogs.

2409
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:42,160
He just isn't for the money.

2410
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:47,320
He is a director and he has been refining his

2411
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:49,840
talent for years.

2412
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:54,920
And it's now that people are going to finally like recognize that

2413
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:59,120
he is, he's a talented director and he is pushing games.

2414
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:02,960
He is pushing movies and he's pushing YouTubers. Honestly,

2415
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:07,240
he is creating a platform for YouTubers to rise up from just being YouTubers

2416
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,160
and to being creators that the public respects.

2417
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,800
Um, I got our chat rooms lighting up.

2418
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,880
I got to get some of these comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2419
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:19,760
Uh, E3VL says Hollywood is part of a cliche.

2420
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,120
Prince Peach Fuzz says Hollywood is full of nepotism.

2421
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:27,480
Um, SSJ100Matt says James Cameron will do the same thing and everyone will think

2422
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,640
it was his idea. Ouch. The truth in that comment. Um,

2423
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:35,000
DJ Rama S says I've had anime cons reject my press application because they said

2424
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,280
podcasting isn't a news outlet. And this is, and this is the thing,

2425
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:43,440
but I bet they will give press passes to a small newspaper out of a small town

2426
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:48,240
in, you know, you name the country or you name the County USA.

2427
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:52,040
I'm not trying to use corporate sponsored podcasts.

2428
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:55,640
Yeah, exactly. And I'm not trying to shade the,

2429
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:59,400
like these newspapers because let's be real, like newspapers and magazines,

2430
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:02,920
it's a dying art form. However, my point is,

2431
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:05,080
it's a very old school set of criteria.

2432
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:10,320
How many people actually into anime fandom are going to read that article on the

2433
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:15,400
back page of a newspaper versus the amount of fans that would care about the

2434
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:19,640
subject matter that your show reaches. And I would bet your show,

2435
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:20,560
as small as it is,

2436
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:24,840
reaches more people than some of the newspapers they're giving press passes to.

2437
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,480
And again, I'm not trying to be shady towards the newspaper,

2438
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:31,400
but I am trying to be shady towards these old school ways of thinking.

2439
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:34,680
People are scared of podcasts. Honestly,

2440
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:38,680
like people are scared because podcasts are independent and that means that

2441
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:40,560
they are not, they are not paid for.

2442
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:43,960
They are just people who are speaking with a microphone and that's what people

2443
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:47,200
are scared of. They want to be able to pay that press off.

2444
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,080
They don't want to have somebody actually come to their show and be like,

2445
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:51,400
so this is the stuff I didn't like.

2446
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:54,600
This is the stuff I liked because they want money in the pocket.

2447
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:58,240
There's another reason why Pump Up the Volume is one of my favorite movies.

2448
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:03,280
That's the reason is, you know, what they were doing with their ham radios,

2449
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:07,320
you know, is what we now do with, with our podcasts and our live radio.

2450
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:12,400
Oh no, that's, remember Orange Launch Radio is not rooted in podcasting.

2451
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,240
I think that's a, that's a very, you know,

2452
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:16,880
because the show is so old it predates podcasting.

2453
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:19,440
I'm sorry to make this topic about us, but it's going to happen.

2454
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:24,480
Is that if you think of this show is inspired by long

2455
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:29,320
form radio shows, which you rarely hear about anymore. That's why,

2456
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:31,040
cause everybody always goes, they, you know,

2457
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:33,160
when I introduced the show and talk about it at conventions,

2458
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:35,600
I can't tell you how often I hear from other podcasters,

2459
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:40,960
you do a two and a half, three hour podcast and every week people listen to that.

2460
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:45,640
I'm like, yeah, it might not be 11 D billion people.

2461
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:49,200
We might not have the reach of a IGN or something like that,

2462
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:52,040
but you know what? There are people that are like, Hey,

2463
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:55,960
I'm going to put in my earbuds as I'm doing my work on Monday and you get me

2464
02:15:55,960 --> 02:16:00,480
through the entire day on Monday. And I love it. And that's, you know,

2465
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:02,880
that's why we keep doing what we're doing. You know,

2466
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:05,000
maybe we need to evolve, but I don't think so.

2467
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,440
I love what we're doing to be honest. We've evolved.

2468
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:11,240
I love Orange Launch Radio. Honestly, since Dark Separat showed it off me.

2469
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:15,040
And I hope I'm a listener for a very long time.

2470
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:17,680
Thank you. I hope you are too. Well, and, and, and.

2471
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:20,160
For killing all of us in dead by daylight, right?

2472
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,960
Don't apologize. Do it again. I told you how we met, right? We had a bad bill.

2473
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:33,840
Oh, there was something to be in the bad. And I didn't know.

2474
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:34,920
That's right.

2475
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:38,720
He was going around behind me and Gwen making noises and fast vaulting and shit.

2476
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:42,240
And so we talked to Fixie about it afterwards.

2477
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,680
And then Fixie watched the stream,

2478
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:46,800
which I also believe was when we all fell in love with get bonked, bitch.

2479
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:50,560
Yeah, it was hilarious.

2480
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:53,960
I didn't realize because when you're streaming one sided as a killer,

2481
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:56,560
you're not thinking of what the other person is saying.

2482
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,000
So I go back and I watch it. I was like, oh God, that bill is actually.

2483
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:03,560
Oh, wait, they said something as they bonked me. That's hilarious.

2484
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:09,000
And I absolutely fell in love with Dark Sakura and the group,

2485
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,560
and apparently I've been adopted as their sibling. So that is.

2486
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:15,680
I have adopted Fixie.

2487
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:17,080
Fixie.

2488
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:20,440
Although from what I heard about your age earlier in the show,

2489
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:22,960
you might actually be the niece, nephew.

2490
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:25,760
What?

2491
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,600
Rob.

2492
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:28,760
What?

2493
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:30,160
Nope.

2494
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:34,320
Nope.

2495
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:37,920
I guess you could call me next gen Orange Lounge radio.

2496
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,280
Oh, love that. Love that.

2497
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:43,640
It's going to be you and Loki's kids.

2498
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:44,160
That's it.

2499
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:47,040
Instead of Orange Lounge, we're going to have you be the Tangerine Dream.

2500
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:48,480
Oh, God.

2501
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:52,040
That reminds me too much of

2502
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:54,680
the Jamba Juice smoothie, the Orange Dream Machine.

2503
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:59,640
Orange Lounge Radio 2.0 or not New Coke, but New Orange Lounge.

2504
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,320
There you go.

2505
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:02,760
You have to call in and talk about food one day.

2506
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:07,560
It has to be the the Star Trek font going next gen.

2507
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,480
The next generation. I love that.

2508
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:11,320
I love that.

2509
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,920
To make it all edgy.

2510
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,720
Anyway, I won't take any more of your time.

2511
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:18,560
I just wanted to pop in and talk about a project that's near and dear to me

2512
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,800
and also just needs to be talked about more.

2513
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,320
So I'll hop on out.

2514
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:23,840
It was wonderful talking with you.

2515
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,480
It was wonderful to have you here.

2516
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:27,800
Fixie in a little bit anyway, right?

2517
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:28,560
Hmm.

2518
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:30,720
We get to hear more from you in a little bit, though, right?

2519
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:33,720
Yeah, there's definitely going to be a stream.

2520
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:35,880
All right. Well, thank you so much, Fixie.

2521
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,120
Oh, go ahead.

2522
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:39,120
I'm rebranding my avatar.

2523
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:42,480
So if people pop on over to soccer or my streams,

2524
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:44,280
they're going to see something new.

2525
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,520
All right. Sounds good.

2526
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:46,960
We'll be keeping an eye out after the show here,

2527
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:48,520
which will wrap up in just a few minutes.

2528
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:50,480
We're going to sneak in one more call here before we do.

2529
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:51,760
But have a good one, Fixie.

2530
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:53,360
Thanks so much for the call.

2531
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:56,400
You too, Rob. All right. Bye bye.

2532
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:58,400
I always appreciate when they take a moment to call into the show.

2533
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:00,520
It's always pleasant to hear from them.

2534
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:02,040
Fixie is a quality person.

2535
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:05,160
Yeah, let's move to another call because somebody else

2536
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:07,600
just popped in the green room and I want to take this call, too.

2537
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:10,200
So hi there. You are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2538
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:12,720
The one and only D.J.

2539
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:15,080
Ron Mez, how is everybody doing tonight?

2540
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:17,360
I'm fabulous now that you're here, Rama.

2541
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:19,720
It's great to have you here.

2542
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:21,840
Rob, what?

2543
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,840
My brother in Christ.

2544
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:27,520
Wow. I haven't been called that ever.

2545
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:33,320
Jamie, my sister in Christ, Loki, my other brother in Christ.

2546
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:38,040
Let me tell you, I don't know what you know about Jamie's personal life, but

2547
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:44,200
how about how about we just say mishpocha?

2548
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:46,600
Fair enough.

2549
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:50,600
Now, there's no secret that

2550
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:56,360
M.A. Jam Session is loosely based off of Orange Lounge Radio.

2551
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:00,080
OK, and I know it's a cool show.

2552
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:04,040
Imitation is the finest form of flattery.

2553
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:05,560
Thank you so much.

2554
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:06,880
I like what Fixie said.

2555
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:08,680
From another console.

2556
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:11,480
Oh, my God.

2557
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:17,120
So part of the reason why I started podcasting is because I have

2558
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:21,080
I can't write. I'm terrible with writing.

2559
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:23,680
Jamie has read my emails.

2560
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:26,280
She has given me grief for it.

2561
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:28,960
I've had a manager that has given me grief for it.

2562
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:33,680
I feel this one hundred percent.

2563
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:37,320
In high school, I had to take the regents exams.

2564
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:42,520
I double talked my way through the essays just so I could pass.

2565
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:48,000
And I would write con reports for other websites, including my own.

2566
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,760
And it got to I just can't do this.

2567
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:54,760
I just feel like I'm repeating myself over and over.

2568
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,800
And I realize if I write notes and I talk about these notes

2569
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,760
and I get feedback.

2570
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:03,680
This is DJ Rama S taking me to church.

2571
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:08,480
This is DJ Rama S taking me to church because I understand him

2572
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:11,480
one hundred percent when he says he can't write.

2573
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,920
Neither can I.

2574
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,880
I have no idea what you're talking about.

2575
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:20,600
Preach. You you sit in the pew and listen.

2576
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:24,040
Play my grandma. She was the English major.

2577
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:31,080
So once I got this going, I'm like, we're going to go to conventions,

2578
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:32,080
we're going to keep this up.

2579
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:34,720
I would sit there and I felt these applications.

2580
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,880
They wanted to know about the last three or four con reports.

2581
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:42,440
I'm just like, shit, I put the links in

2582
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:45,920
and I would tell them exactly what I was going to do for some conventions.

2583
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:49,080
I'm a one man band running around taking pictures, doing interviews,

2584
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:50,400
all this and all that.

2585
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:53,240
And I would tell them we do this on a weekly podcast.

2586
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:55,400
And they will come back and say, well,

2587
02:21:56,480 --> 02:22:00,120
we don't know what podcasting is, so it's not a viable news outlet.

2588
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:02,840
So therefore, your press application has been rejected.

2589
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:05,200
And I'm just like, are you kidding me right now?

2590
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:10,480
I would say you provide live entertainment.

2591
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:14,360
With syndicated publishing.

2592
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,800
I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to write that down.

2593
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,040
I swear to I swear to God.

2594
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:21,160
Oh, how you praise it.

2595
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:24,680
I swear to God, we're going to just start a Vogue network newspaper.

2596
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:27,800
And then that way we can all say we work for a newspaper called Vogue Network.

2597
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:33,600
And that will print one issue every month or one one copy of an issue every month.

2598
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:37,040
So that way it's done and put it in a in a bin somewhere.

2599
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:40,320
And that's it. And then they'll be like newspapers.

2600
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:41,480
Those are so old.

2601
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:43,520
Now, you know, it's about Rob.

2602
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:47,440
Honestly, that would be really good for my resume.

2603
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:49,680
I love Fixies comment.

2604
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,560
We could do a zine. Fuck yes.

2605
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:53,400
We're taking it back to 97.

2606
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:54,960
We're going to do a fucking zine.

2607
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:58,720
I love it. We're going to staple them and do them on a mimeograph.

2608
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:04,440
Don't mind me, I am getting my coffee because, you know, I had to talk,

2609
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:06,400
you know, I had to talk.

2610
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:08,720
Spill that tea, Rama, spill it.

2611
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:13,120
Well, you say if we do the e-zine, we have to save a PDF

2612
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:15,640
version on the website so we can have an archive.

2613
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,920
Yeah, yeah.

2614
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,440
By the way, Rama, I have to ask.

2615
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:20,880
I have to have you do something for me, but I'll tell you offline

2616
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:23,480
because it involves going to a Jewish deli in Crown Heights.

2617
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:25,080
I got you.

2618
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:29,720
I can't help but wonder, is this is this related to why I just got a con report

2619
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,240
for publication at VOG Network?

2620
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:34,760
Because I feel like it might be along those lines.

2621
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:36,520
Yes. Yes.

2622
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:38,720
That's why we built it.

2623
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:41,480
Great. Can't wait to push the publish button on it.

2624
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,920
Yes, I. Yeah.

2625
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:49,560
You know, it's like there are some conventions they are like,

2626
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:50,560
oh, I see what you do.

2627
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:53,680
We'll give you a press pass and others are like, yeah, no.

2628
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:57,480
I've had people like I have never heard of you or I've been told, well,

2629
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:59,200
here's what you got to do.

2630
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,600
Your Alexa ranking has to be a certain amount.

2631
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,760
And I'm just like, are you kidding me?

2632
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:06,280
I'm going to fucking barf.

2633
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:09,240
You know what? I want some money right here.

2634
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:12,240
Does it look like I have Alexa ranking money in my pocket? OK.

2635
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:16,760
No, like some rankings on my Internet in the year twenty twenty three.

2636
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:21,480
What the fuck is your Internet still powered by a fourteen four hundred

2637
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:24,280
baud modem? Like, get the fuck out of here.

2638
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:27,080
Alexa Ray. Is Alexa even still a thing?

2639
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:30,720
Listen, listen, me and Alexa are on a first name basis.

2640
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,080
So it's fine. I'm sorry.

2641
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:35,040
Was my GeoCities address not good enough for you?

2642
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:40,480
Fuck. There is another reason why press outlets like mine

2643
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:42,160
do not like read pop. OK.

2644
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2645
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:51,600
There's a reason why I stopped putting in applications.

2646
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:55,400
Oh, OK. I actually want you to say, well, your site's not popular enough,

2647
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:57,840
so we're going to reject your press pass.

2648
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:59,200
Well, you couldn't pull off E3.

2649
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:03,440
So there the man said, the man said, that is all.

2650
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:06,160
The man said it.

2651
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:10,120
There's no love lost between me and read pop.

2652
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:14,080
As I've told people who keep asking me every year, are you going to Comic-Con?

2653
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:17,120
Absolutely not. It is too crowded for me.

2654
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:18,680
Somebody hit my camera.

2655
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:20,720
These hands are ready to eat for everyone.

2656
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,240
I understand they have some anime stuff.

2657
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:30,760
It was the one year they joined forces with Anime Expo

2658
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:33,400
and it was a giant cluster.

2659
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:36,680
OK. All right.

2660
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:40,160
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry to all the smart speakers

2661
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:45,120
I've been setting off, apparently, by saying the A-L-E-X-A word over and over.

2662
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:47,800
Sorry, Pod Culture and others.

2663
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:53,840
I'm going to go down this rabbit hole and and I apologize for nothing.

2664
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:59,240
Amistad was a cakewalk compared to how and read pop

2665
02:25:59,240 --> 02:26:01,280
and AX pulled off their anime weekend.

2666
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:02,840
OK, it was like that.

2667
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:10,480
But now that we're at a point where everybody's doing a podcast

2668
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:13,760
and people are saying this, it's getting oversaturated.

2669
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:17,280
I'm like, it's only oversaturated if you listen to too many podcasts.

2670
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,360
I do mine. I listen to Yo Guy.

2671
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:20,880
I listen to a lot of people.

2672
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:22,800
I still have time to listen to music and do what I got to do.

2673
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,640
Everybody wants to do something.

2674
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:26,000
So you roll with it.

2675
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,440
I tell people, if you want to do a podcast, just do it.

2676
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:33,480
Don't listen to somebody who says you just do it.

2677
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:34,560
You never know.

2678
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:40,280
As long as you have the love in your heart for it, just have at it.

2679
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:41,240
Here's the thing.

2680
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:44,440
You ready? Get your tea, because I'm going to spill some.

2681
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:45,080
Get it.

2682
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,120
Oh, sucky sucky now.

2683
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:50,360
This is some spicy hot tea, because you fucking ready for this?

2684
02:26:50,360 --> 02:26:51,560
I'm going to say it like it is.

2685
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:56,600
When people say that the market is saturated by podcasts,

2686
02:26:56,840 --> 02:27:00,640
what they really mean is that the market is saturated by white men in

2687
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,760
their basement doing a podcast.

2688
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:08,280
There is nothing wrong with trying to bring more diverse perspectives

2689
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:13,800
and opinions to the table and enabling more people to get their words

2690
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:17,560
out there, because it is through that diversity and through those

2691
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:21,640
other lenses that we are going to get the criticism that a lot of

2692
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:26,160
these old fart ways so desperately need when it comes to these

2693
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:30,720
conventions and these other things that have been built around a

2694
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:35,440
culture that only listens to these particular voices.

2695
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:41,520
Sip on that, because that's what saturation, that's what it is.

2696
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:45,960
That is some bitter vinegar that they all need to drink.

2697
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:49,400
Let me just say this, and I'm going to go about my way.

2698
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:53,400
I'm going to finish my nice, nice roast of coffee here.

2699
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:59,800
I find it amusing that there are some conventions that will not accept

2700
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:06,280
my site or certain others, but yet we're the ones that are doing everything.

2701
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:09,280
I got one person doing interviews.

2702
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:11,000
I got one person actually writing the reports.

2703
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:16,520
I got one person doing photography and we after the end of the weekend,

2704
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:17,360
what do we do?

2705
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,480
We have something ready for you on Tuesday.

2706
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,600
A week later, we got the com report for you.

2707
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:25,840
A few weeks, a couple of weeks later, the photos are edited and

2708
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:27,800
ready to share with the world.

2709
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:30,680
I don't see anybody else.

2710
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:34,440
And as many cons I have gone to and they talk about, oh, we only have

2711
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:37,880
limited amount of press passes, sometimes I find that I'm the only one

2712
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:40,080
that's actually there doing stuff, OK?

2713
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:44,760
But it's OK because I love what I do.

2714
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:52,640
And that's that and that and that is how OLR has lasted 21 years next month.

2715
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,160
And now we know.

2716
02:28:55,360 --> 02:28:57,480
And knowing is half the battle.

2717
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:02,240
On that note, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap this shit up for the night.

2718
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:08,880
Do you have any final thoughts or would you like to plug your, you know, little

2719
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:11,640
underground show that a few cons have heard of?

2720
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:16,560
Yes, I would like everybody, if they're free Tuesday nights around nine o'clock,

2721
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:20,440
to swing through vognetwork.com and animejamsession.com to check out

2722
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:25,280
anime jam session on Twitch and you'll hear me talk about how I should be, I

2723
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:30,480
should not be buying any more figurines and stuff like that because I had four of

2724
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:36,080
them arrive at my porch this week and I've kind of started running out of room.

2725
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:39,440
I just spent three hours clearing out my closet to make space.

2726
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,640
And I just got a new Nightcrawler figure.

2727
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:50,680
Girl, girl, I'm going to turn all the lights on if you can see it.

2728
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:54,120
I have, there's a bunch of figurines right there.

2729
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:57,160
There's a bunch more behind the door over here.

2730
02:29:57,960 --> 02:29:59,680
There's a bunch of pops up there.

2731
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:04,320
I should swing the camera around so you should see it.

2732
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:06,120
Do you see this?

2733
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:07,360
I see it.

2734
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:08,000
I see it.

2735
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,120
Definitely like the board game.

2736
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:12,720
Mario, Mario Kondo is about to punch you both in the face.

2737
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:13,520
Just saying.

2738
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:16,040
Oh, Rob, I'm so proud of you for saying her name, right?

2739
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:18,320
But I also went out and got this.

2740
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:23,440
I got an awesome PDR shirt at the collection and I realized I've run out

2741
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:25,800
of space in the drawer to put it away.

2742
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:29,840
Actually in my defense, it's because I've been cleaning out other rooms

2743
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:32,520
that a bunch of shit's in here, including like some of my gym equipment.

2744
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:32,960
So.

2745
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:37,680
If you all could stop comparing sizes for a minute.

2746
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:42,120
Excuse me while I whip this joke.

2747
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:47,360
Rob, I'm sorry.

2748
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:49,000
I did not know your size, King.

2749
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:49,840
I am so sorry.

2750
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:53,360
Don't, don't you forget it.

2751
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:54,160
All right.

2752
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:57,440
Get off my program.

2753
02:30:58,040 --> 02:30:58,720
I'm done.

2754
02:30:58,920 --> 02:30:59,680
I'm done.

2755
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:01,320
I can't with you.

2756
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:02,480
I cannot.

2757
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:03,800
But I love you.

2758
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:04,720
Love you, Mean It.

2759
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:05,400
All right.

2760
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:06,160
Take care of my friend.

2761
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:06,880
Till next time.

2762
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:15,120
The one and only DJ Roma S from Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays as a part of the

2763
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:18,880
Voice of Geeks network, but on their own Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash

2764
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,720
Anime Jam Session.

2765
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:22,240
Whoo.

2766
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:22,680
All right.

2767
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:29,640
Uh, oh, I had a quick, quick question from Twitter that came through and here it

2768
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:33,840
is, uh, from Garth the Wolf over, uh, to our Twitter at OLR.

2769
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:35,760
We love Garth Wolf.

2770
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:40,520
For all three hosts, name one Final Fantasy series.

2771
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:41,800
Oh, your favorite topic, Jamie.

2772
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,040
Name one Final Fantasy series song that resonates with you.

2773
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:52,760
Um, um, I really like Kiss Me Goodbye.

2774
02:31:54,280 --> 02:32:00,280
I mean, it's just, I love the Angela Aki, like in a really, really, I just

2775
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:01,600
love her voice so much.

2776
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:06,760
Um, and I'm sad that she hasn't put on any new music, but I know that she

2777
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:14,040
went in, uh, to study music in the U S but her, her voice is amazing.

2778
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:19,600
If you want to hear a really good song by her, listen to Tagami and, um, which

2779
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:24,720
means letter, and it's about her talking to her younger self, um, and of

2780
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:25,920
course you want to find translation.

2781
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:30,600
She has covered so many bands in, um, in Japanese.

2782
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:35,160
Uh, she did, she did, we are the champions in Japanese.

2783
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:41,840
Um, but her voice is probably one of my favorite singing voices ever.

2784
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:43,440
And Kiss Me Goodbye is such a good song.

2785
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,560
It was actually the song that got her charted.

2786
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:52,400
Uh, I remember, oh, go ahead.

2787
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:52,640
Sorry.

2788
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:58,640
I just remember, uh, reading an interview with her where she went to go see, um, I

2789
02:32:58,640 --> 02:33:03,600
think it was Anna Tsuchiya at the Budokan and she was like, I want to be up there

2790
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:04,160
one day.

2791
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:09,880
And then right after that, she got the thing for, uh, Squenix to, to do the

2792
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:10,200
song.

2793
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:12,640
And a year later she was playing at the Budokan.

2794
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:16,440
Um, Loki, do you have an answer for this?

2795
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:19,120
Otherworld from Final Fantasy X.

2796
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:21,160
Ah, good pick.

2797
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:23,480
Um, I have two answers for this.

2798
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:27,840
I would say probably above and beyond Terra's theme from Final Fantasy VI.

2799
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:33,320
Um, there's just something epic about the way that game opens with the mech in the

2800
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:33,880
snow.

2801
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:38,360
And there's just, I, the way they kind of weave that theme throughout the game

2802
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:38,880
itself.

2803
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:42,560
And, you know, just the iconic, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

2804
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:46,800
I think it's just, it's, it's just so powerful.

2805
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:49,040
That's just such a powerful, meaningful song.

2806
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,200
A more contemporary answer I would actually throw out there, I'm going to go

2807
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:53,880
to 14.

2808
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:59,000
I have to, but I would say the song To the Edge, which is the fight that you do

2809
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:04,040
against the Warrior of Light, um, uh, that you fight as part of the, um, uh,

2810
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:05,840
Shadowbringers expansion fights.

2811
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:12,200
The reason why I say that song, when you find out the story behind it, how, um,

2812
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:17,920
Soken, the main, main composer you may or may not recall was, was battling

2813
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:22,320
cancer, uh, and was actually in the hospital when he wrote that song.

2814
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:30,040
And it gives a whole nother layer and depth to that, that is so powerful, um,

2815
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:34,680
that I would highly, even if you don't enjoy 14, you don't go watch a video of

2816
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:38,120
this fight, the Warrior of Light fight, or To the Edge is the name of the song.

2817
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:42,000
It's just, I mean, it doesn't really relate to any other Final Fantasy game,

2818
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:45,040
besides who you're fighting, obviously, which is a really cool interpretation of

2819
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:48,880
the original Final Fantasy I Warrior of Light, but just when you hear the full

2820
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:52,320
backstory behind that, it's powerful.

2821
02:34:52,520 --> 02:35:01,160
Um, and just, just goes to show how Soken, not that, not that, um, Nobuimatsu,

2822
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:06,840
my God, brain fart, not that Uematsu can ever be replaced, but if there must be a

2823
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:11,920
successor, Soken is a hundred percent worthy of that.

2824
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:13,480
He's so good.

2825
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:15,200
May I actually make an addition, then?

2826
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,000
Yeah, please.

2827
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,400
All, all of the music outside of Uldah.

2828
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:19,600
Mmm.

2829
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:21,720
Yeah, I just-

2830
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:24,720
I could sit and listen to that for hours.

2831
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:25,440
The work-

2832
02:35:25,440 --> 02:35:26,680
Because I haven't listened to it for hours.

2833
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:35,440
The work that Soken has done on Final Fantasy XIV, history will look back on

2834
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:42,320
it and realize what an impactful fucking guy he was on, on gaming music.

2835
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:46,480
I mean, just the guy from Mario Tennis went on to did this, do this.

2836
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:47,360
It's incredible.

2837
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:48,200
It's incredible.

2838
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:49,840
Anyway, those are my answers, Garth.

2839
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:50,720
All right.

2840
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:55,040
On that note, um, Dark Soccer, I think you were going to bow out just a little early

2841
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:57,320
because I know you wanted to do something before you start your stream, so-

2842
02:35:57,320 --> 02:35:58,480
Yeah, I want to make a sandwich.

2843
02:35:58,520 --> 02:35:59,120
I'm hungry.

2844
02:35:59,160 --> 02:35:59,760
No worries.

2845
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:03,160
Before I check in with Loki on any final stories, then let me go to you with any

2846
02:36:03,160 --> 02:36:05,240
final thoughts you might have before I wrap it up tonight.

2847
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,400
Are they Final Fantasy thoughts?

2848
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:08,480
If you want them to be.

2849
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,600
Uh, no, I don't really have any.

2850
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,360
Oh yeah.

2851
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:17,400
Um, I, uh, I, I really am kind of getting obsessed with ballet.

2852
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Like, I feel awesome.

2853
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:22,960
Good.

2854
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:23,840
And insane.

2855
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:32,240
I found muscles that I didn't know were in my body and all of them are right

2856
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:35,200
around my hip and my knees and they're like, Hey, guess what?

2857
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:42,320
You old, but, but I, uh, I, I, I fall in love with it more and more every day.

2858
02:36:42,320 --> 02:36:49,120
And I, I feel like I can call myself a dancer, even if I'm, I never liked dancing

2859
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:54,920
before, unless it was DDR, you remember me saying that ballet has become my DDR.

2860
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:56,560
All right.

2861
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:59,560
Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go have a good stream tonight.

2862
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:00,800
All right.

2863
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:02,400
Have fun storming the castle.

2864
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:03,400
We'll try.

2865
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:04,000
All right.

2866
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:05,760
Think it'll work.

2867
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:07,320
It'll take a miracle.

2868
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:07,800
There you go.

2869
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:08,800
Bye.

2870
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:11,920
See, I knew she'd be pissed if I didn't give her the follow-up line.

2871
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:12,440
All right.

2872
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:13,320
Uh, low key.

2873
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:14,120
Let me check in real quick.

2874
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:16,400
Any, um, um, last minute stories for us.

2875
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:16,560
Yeah.

2876
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:17,600
Yes, we do have one.

2877
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:23,480
Uh, so this is not much of a surprise, but apparently, uh, Nintendo was asked

2878
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:30,320
valve to, uh, remove the dolphin emulator off of their, uh, storefront.

2879
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:33,640
I want to say, I'm sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but there was some very

2880
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:37,280
interesting discussion on this, on our discord server over at vod network.com

2881
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:37,880
slash discord.

2882
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:41,320
And the reason why I say that is that there was chat about that the press may

2883
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:46,480
not be framing this accurately because it sounds like valve actually contacted

2884
02:37:46,480 --> 02:37:52,160
Nintendo saying, um, thoughts and Nintendo replied saying, and I'm

2885
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:55,960
paraphrasing, we don't like it, get rid of it type of thing.

2886
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:59,160
So it actually sounds like, even though it sounds like, oh, Nintendo's lawyers

2887
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:03,080
strike again, it sounds like valve may have actually initiated.

2888
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:06,720
Like, um, are you, you mad bro?

2889
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:09,840
Like, it seems like valve may have initiated that conversation, which I

2890
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:12,760
understand, you know, as much as we want to say, ah, fuck valve for doing that.

2891
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:17,240
I understand why from a legal perspective, they're probably going, you know what, if

2892
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:20,680
we don't go to the lawyers, the lawyers are going to come to us.

2893
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:23,960
So I do understand from that perspective, but anyway, I'm sorry, Loki, go ahead.

2894
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:26,520
I just wanted to get that because I did see folks talking about that on discord.

2895
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:30,160
I do want you all to know, even if I don't always respond to every message, I read

2896
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:31,080
discord all the time.

2897
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:31,760
So anyway,

2898
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:37,320
according to the dolphin developers, they said that we've been notified by valve, um,

2899
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:42,120
that the Nintendo has issued a cease and desist, fighting the DMCA against the

2900
02:38:42,120 --> 02:38:47,160
dolphins steam page and had removed dolphin from steam until the matter is

2901
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:47,720
settled.

2902
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:52,600
Um, they're currently investigating their options and we'll have a more in depth

2903
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:53,760
response in their future.

2904
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:56,160
It may be just like some of the stuff that's on there.

2905
02:38:56,440 --> 02:39:01,520
Uh, but according to, they said the legal notice is they accused dolphin of using

2906
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:06,560
cryptographic keys without Nintendo's authorization and decrypting ROMs at, or

2907
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:08,240
immediately before runtime.

2908
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:08,840
Wow.

2909
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:10,560
So, all right.

2910
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:13,560
Well, we'll just have to use all the other ways to get that.

2911
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:18,240
It's not like you can't get that thing on a steam deck if you don't know if you, if

2912
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:19,920
you know there's ways to do it anyway.

2913
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:20,600
All right.

2914
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:23,320
Thank you all so much for listening to orange launch radio this week.

2915
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:25,400
Thank you for downloading the show or listening to us live.

2916
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:28,520
However you consume the show, I'm sure you heard it earlier in the show.

2917
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:33,880
It's, it's hard to stick out sometimes and it's hard to, um, you know, go against

2918
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:36,080
all these very large corporate podcasts.

2919
02:39:36,280 --> 02:39:39,880
So we appreciate you for finding us on our little portion of the internet and I

2920
02:39:39,880 --> 02:39:40,960
hope you enjoyed what you heard.

2921
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:44,760
Um, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are

2922
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:46,080
the show where every gamer has a voice.

2923
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:47,880
We need more voices to put out there on air.

2924
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:51,960
Um, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever you heard

2925
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:55,480
this podcast, they go an awful long way and we really appreciate it all.

2926
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:58,560
Um, so with all of that, let's get final thoughts for the night.

2927
02:39:58,600 --> 02:40:00,320
Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.

2928
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:07,080
Well, thought is, uh, I'm hopefully going to keep, I need to keep a pace to get all

2929
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:09,040
my stuff done for the end of the season.

2930
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:11,480
So, but yeah, the next episode is going to be cool.

2931
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:13,000
All right, awesome.

2932
02:40:13,400 --> 02:40:17,920
Um, my final thought is I had a great time at my work conference and there's stuff I

2933
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:22,520
learned there that I feel like I can apply to the stuff I do here and throughout my,

2934
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:24,640
the rest of my life as well, which is always a great feeling.

2935
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:30,240
Um, and, um, number two, Diablo four comes out this week and I'm fucking excited as

2936
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:32,440
somebody who's been a Diablo fan for a very long time.

2937
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:35,320
So it is going to be a great gaming week.

2938
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:40,160
The big summer of gaming begins right now and it is exciting.

2939
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:43,560
Oh, and third, I'm taking a third final thought cause we missed last week.

2940
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:48,920
Um, you'll notice tonight I am wearing my pride, uh, wristband here on my Apple watch.

2941
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:54,040
That is because pride month, as far as I'm concerned, has officially been extended from

2942
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:55,920
Memorial day to the 4th of July.

2943
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:56,280
That's right.

2944
02:40:56,280 --> 02:41:01,240
There's been an extension on pride month because of all the fuckery, these assholes

2945
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:02,600
out there keep putting us through.

2946
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:08,600
It is very clear that one month is not enough for us to say we're here, we're queer.

2947
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:09,720
Get used to it.

2948
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:12,760
And on that note, I'm going to roll the credits.

2949
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:14,160
Have a wonderful week, everybody.
