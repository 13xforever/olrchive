9815	12697	The mainstream merchandising of Nintendo properties continues.
12697	14899	Welcome, LEGO Animal Crossing.
14899	24626	A relative newcomer debuting in the 2000s with less frequent releases than Mario's mainline titles, Animal Crossing nevertheless strikes a chord going against the grain of fast-paced action genres gaming is more often known for.
24626	28469	Nintendo's modern licensing is going much better than its attempts in the 90s and 2000s.
28469	29990	This is the Brick and More Bricks headline.
29990	34994	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34994	37096	Starting right now on the show, wherever your gamer has a voice,
39154	41996	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41996	46658	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46658	49140	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49140	58265	We are live once again tonight, October the 8th of 2023 with episode number 977 of our show.
58265	63828	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every Sunday night along with my co hosts.
63828	67110	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
68050	68730	Oh, hi.
68730	68990	Hello.
68990	69291	Hello.
69291	71031	How are you?
71031	73592	I'm feeling pleased.
73592	79575	I managed to get my Discord, not my Discord, but my Stream Deck audio working finally.
79575	80875	I had to route it the right way.
80875	84577	I had to find the right output, but now the sound is playing.
84577	87578	Sad thing I can't get it to work through Discord, but I'm working on that next.
87889	94513	I always love this little background that you use on your VTuber because I just I always hear it in my mind.
94513	97255	I feel like like when I introduce you, you're just going to go.
97255	99537	The last Metroid is in captivity.
99537	101638	The galaxy is at peace.
101638	104660	Well, at least I didn't do my my second pick.
104660	106161	Which would have been what?
106161	109403	The blood pouring out of the elevator from The Shining.
109403	111605	Well, it is it is October.
111605	113246	It's it's that time if you're going to.
113246	114967	I'll work in no play make Jack a dull boy.
117075	121158	No, no, it's all work and no play make Jamie a dull person.
121158	121599	Yeah.
121599	123520	So there you go.
123520	125342	All right.
125342	126503	Also say hello.
126503	128764	I've been into a different horror series lately.
128764	131186	Also say hello to somebody who could never be a dull person.
131186	133668	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
133668	136190	I think a lot of people disagree with that.
136190	137131	Oh, come on now.
137131	137791	Come on now.
137791	141614	You're you're the coolest Minecraft dad out there on YouTube.
141614	142055	Give me a break.
142948	143349	All right.
143349	144870	Oh, I think I recognize the game.
144870	155599	This is a play behind you tonight because we do tape live every Sunday night over at the Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
155599	159682	And even though we try to keep it mostly audio because we know a lot of you listen on the podcast feed.
159682	166228	We just can't help but have some video and visual references such as the Super Metroid background I referenced a moment ago with DarkSakura.
166928	171709	and the game that's playing behind Loki tonight, which I think is Phasmophobia.
171709	172870	That's the name of that game, right?
172870	173330	Yes.
173330	174410	Yay, I got one!
174410	183212	Okay, because that was being streamed on Twitch by a lot of Dead by Daylight streamers for a hot minute, and then I'd say 90% of them dropped it.
183212	190834	I was gonna guess either that or Demonologist, but it looks more like Phasmo, so... I only knew that scene where he went in the truck and looked at the board.
190834	192895	Like, I was like, oh, I recognize that.
192895	194515	I completely recognized it.
194515	194635	So...
195177	195877	Yeah.
195877	197759	Great.
197759	199059	Well, why Phasmore?
199059	201501	Is it scary games because it's October?
201501	202902	It's that season?
202902	203562	Yeah.
203562	203802	Yeah.
203802	206123	Because I'm running out of games to put in there.
206123	206544	I see.
206544	207424	I understand.
207424	210166	What are just just kind of taking a poll real quick.
210166	213968	We have some news on scary games coming out tonight, but I'm kind of curious.
213968	218371	Do you have some games that kind of put you in the mood for the season?
218371	222013	Do you have favorite, you know.
222013	223634	Macabre games
224977	239943	evil or just you know a little bit you know is there is there something you and not really like i don't i'm desensitized all the death by daylight i guess i was gonna say if you did say that by daylight i'd be kind of shocked um yeah
244765	258376	I like my October video games like I like my scary movies cheesy as fuck so I would say I like 8-bit Friday the 13th is one of my favorite classics for sure.
258936	261058	Maybe Splatterhouse, but the original.
261058	264500	I like, do you know what game used to scare the shit out of me when I was younger?
264500	274568	Okay, it was Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo when they tried to emulate that whole like, because Doom and Wolfenstein 3D were all the rage.
274568	280453	So they tried to do like a version of that using a combination of Mode 7 and like sprites.
280453	283035	It looked like garbage, but they kind of pulled it off.
283595	293542	And so you were in these like you were you would go in these tunnels and then suddenly like you would turn around and a fucking velociraptor would jump out and attack you and it was scary.
293542	295403	That was a scary experience.
295403	299246	So I would say all the playthroughs I've been watching of Alien Isolation.
299979	300679	Oh yeah.
300679	301060	Oh yeah.
301060	305622	That, that, those, those are like the, those games are almost too scary for me now.
305622	313385	I love how perfectly they, they caught the aesthetic from the original movie, because I mean, that's only 15 years later.
313385	314946	So the aesthetics wouldn't have changed that much.
314946	319588	Not like 57 years where Aliens was, uh, you know, was.
319588	320488	Right.
320488	326291	So, I mean, I liked that they kept that sort of, uh, seventies future theme.
328413	330515	I love branding and I love theming.
330515	332377	Looking at chat for some comments.
332377	336100	Questbuster agreeing alien isolation is so good.
336100	341606	Fifth Dream throwing it way back saying Atari 2600 haunted house terrified me.
341606	343007	So many jump scares.
343007	347992	You know, I was just reading, I was just looking this up because I was looking for the news tonight and
348913	355178	Haunted House, the Atari game, you know, Atari is leaning into some of their old classics and doing these remastered games.
355178	360542	And they just had a re-imagining of Haunted House on the Atari 50 collection, right?
360542	364305	Which kind of is a throwback to the old school game, but like, you know, in modern graphics.
364305	370009	But there's another, another Haunted House game coming out that's like a roguelite.
370009	373132	But when I was looking at it, like they made it like with kids,
373772	374872	going into a haunted house.
374872	377213	It kind of like it doesn't look scary at all.
377213	378574	Or like it's it's scary.
378574	381595	Like, are you afraid of the dark on Nickelodeon is scary.
381595	383036	You know, like it's it's not.
383036	387658	I mean, yeah, like I could think of like that would be cool, though.
387658	393080	Like if you go into it as this is the presentation, like it is supposed to be like, are you afraid of the dark?
393080	394421	I think that would be kind of cool.
394421	395461	Yeah.
395461	402604	But yeah, it's it's almost like they're very interchanging, you know, alone in the dark and haunted.
403120	409765	Mansion or Haunted House or whatever to just make a game and slap one of our licenses on it.
409765	410285	We'll do that one
411705	415748	SGO 100 Matt says Rob didn't have fun when he streamed Slenderman that one time.
415748	418530	Oh my god, that was years ago, years ago.
418530	420711	But that was mostly Shane's fault for making him play it.
420711	422873	Well, he tends to do that.
422873	425535	And SheHulk10 says Friday the 13th is a great game.
425535	426355	Very scary.
426355	437723	Yeah, you know, you know, for as much crap as that old 8-bit Friday the 13th gets, when you go in the houses in that first person mode, when you turn a corner and Jace is right there and the music goes boom, boom, boom,
437963	446753	like it's it's legit kind of freaky like it's a jump scare you know it's a it's old school but that's what we had before five nights at freddy's you know so
448620	449921	There's that.
449921	451303	All right.
451303	456508	Let's get into some video game news and what's going on around the gaming world.
456508	457689	We have a kickoff topic tonight.
457689	460191	This is kind of a big one.
460191	467338	The cord continuing to be cut, so to speak, on some consoles of the not too distant past.
467338	469280	Loki, why don't you fill us in on what's going on here?
470186	475408	I'm actually surprised that they're still doing that because they were shutting down the marketplaces for these for a while.
475408	482670	But now Nintendo has announced they're going to stop supporting the 3DS and Wii U online in 2024, April 2024 to be exact.
482670	483851	So at this point, you know, like
488602	495145	The Pokemon Bank will be the only software accessible online.
495145	498127	I love that they had to make an exception for Pokemon Bank.
498127	500808	You know why they had to make an exception for Pokemon Bank?
500808	501549	Anger everybody.
501549	507752	Well, you literally cannot transfer from earlier gens without it at this point.
507752	509513	I mean, I'm trying to think.
510855	514276	I really don't think there's a way to do it, especially once they pull online support.
514276	533703	Yeah, because you could technically put cartridge in cartridge and I mean, and there was the like Pokemon yellow and stuff they released on 3ds that had in it, but I want to say even going cartridge to cartridge cartridge, you could cartridge hop those Pokemon all the way up to like sun and moon probably but then you can't without Pokemon bank, you can't get them off of there.
534363	540487	So without this, you literally will have Pokemon that are stuck forever that you can't bring into the newest games.
540487	547271	So they had to make an exception for that, which I think is wild because like just make it doable on the Switch already.
547271	548412	Good God.
548412	549693	Anyway, sorry.
549693	553075	No, we can't do that.
553075	561620	But yeah, this is a part of they said the part of the natural life cycle of any product as it becomes less used by consumers over time.
563558	577443	I mean, yeah, I get it, but also sometimes like with that, you know, we perhaps should have, like, for example, Pokemon Bank transitioned it over to the Switch already because how long has the Switch been out?
577443	578344	A while.
578344	581005	Like, what is the holdup?
581005	583666	We're going to be on like another Switch here pretty soon.
583666	586367	Switch 2 or whatever we're going to call the next thing of hardware.
586367	591829	It's, you know, they're going to have to do something.
591829	592029	Yeah.
593001	597843	You know, and it's just it really is a crime that we don't have the older Pokemon games on the switch.
597843	599564	It's it's like, what are they holding out for?
599564	600725	Well, I know what they're holding out for.
600725	602606	They want to charge more money to play.
602606	604847	They don't want to just throw them in the Nintendo library.
604847	608708	But like, come on, like, it's time to rerelease some of the old games already.
608708	612890	And some would argue, Rob, if you want gem one, you could get let's go Pikachu, let's go Eevee.
612890	615412	But like, it's it's not it's not the same damn thing.
615412	615892	And you know it.
616914	618275	and there's still gen two and three.
618275	620496	I mean, I guess once you get up to gen four, there's the remakes.
620496	626558	But you know, like it's it's high time we have some proper Pokemon back catalog on the switch.
626558	629320	Or at least I hope they're thinking about a successor if nothing else.
629320	631380	I like let's let's go Pikachu.
631380	636543	But um, I mean, are they going to make any more of those anytime soon?
636543	637343	Probably not.
637343	639124	Yeah, like, it's too bad.
640768	649239	Anyway, but what do you think about the fact that okay, outside of Pokemon, which I've been hyper focusing on, but what about all the other games that are going to be, you know, losing their online support?
649239	649599	I mean,
650708	655472	It's eventually going to happen, so it makes sense that they would do that.
655472	660636	I don't think it's really utilizing that much of their bandwidth or anything.
660636	675587	It's almost too bad that they can't have, instead of dedicated servers, it's just peer-to-peer or some way to just keep open a small subset of servers that can handle the multiplayer for a bunch of different games or whatever.
675587	678349	But it's understandable that they're going to do that.
679602	680342	Thanks for watching!
704218	705439	It's interesting, though.
705439	709501	I mean, I I kind of understand that they're pulling the plug on the Wii U. That I get.
709501	712824	I don't think there's many people that are still rocking the Wii U at this point.
712824	722089	The 3DS, on the other hand, I feel like I still see people that use 3DS, you know, like it's it's still a smaller system than the Switch overall.
722089	725472	I think more kids maybe have a 3DS.
725472	726632	It's a good starter system.
726632	729174	So I'm I'm a little bit surprised that they're pulling that.
729174	732456	But maybe they kind of go, well, kids don't eat online because that's where the creepers are.
735938	751310	There's other services like Pretendo for example that's emulating their Nintendo Network and they're about two thirds of the way complete as far as being able to support a lot of the stuff that was being used for like the Wii U and 3DS.
753817	762667	Right now the only thing they have that works 100% is Wii U chat and friends, but everything else is still kind of a work in progress with that.
762667	769995	And you know, and unfortunately with that, like I could see them getting all the way to 100% or getting close to it and Nintendo's like,
770928	774451	Yeah, even though these are old systems we don't support anymore, we're also jerks.
774451	778054	So cease and desist for you, you know, type of thing.
778054	780776	Yeah, they're gonna have to be very careful in how they release something like that.
780776	789463	They have to do it in a manner where it's like, it's not fully announced until it's on the internet, because then you can't pull it once on the internet, always on the internet, right?
789463	796229	That's the only way these things don't get shut down is you have to you have to keep it in your pants until it's time.
796229	796609	And then
797630	800513	Boom, stealth release, here it is, download now.
800513	805179	And then even if the lawyers come out, oh, sorry, it's already on BitTorrent everywhere.
805179	807281	You know, like, that's, that's it.
807281	816772	So, but I yeah, I noticed how quick on social media, some of the homebrew in that community was quick to say that they're working on solutions, basically, which is which is interesting.
817192	823979	Now, Bobby Blackwolf does point out Nintendo hasn't shut down the Wii version yet, and it's been 100% for years.
823979	829244	Wiimifi, I don't know how you pronounce that, but it's been out for a while.
829244	830045	And I guess that's true.
830045	839634	I've seen the replacement Nintendo Network stuff on there, like the news channel on the Wii still running with current headlines and stuff.
839634	840635	Kind of fascinating to me.
841138	844260	Yeah, that is kind of weird that it's not shut down.
844260	845741	I wonder what the case is for that.
845741	859550	Maybe is the Wii like still available, like say, other countries like Brazil or something like that where they aren't getting like modern consoles or, you know, one of those territories?
859550	861971	Is that why they're keeping that stuff alive?
861971	866154	No, I assume that was all running like third party or through one of these homebrew things.
867683	869744	Number one, we have to talk about how amazing
889320	896332	the WeConnect24 theme is because it's it sounds very urgent when you hear it.
896332	897373	I don't know if you remember.
897373	903103	I apologize, my co-host, because you're not going to hear it as I play it, but I'm going to play it here real quick for the listeners here.
907841	922949	See that sense of urgency with that duh, duh, like, you know, and then this is actually somebody going into a modern Wii Connect news channel because the whole thing of this YouTube is that they're pulling up the mugshot of our former president on a Nintendo Wii.
922949	924109	Yeah, I've seen this one, yeah.
924109	934114	So you can see this inglorious like 300 resolution or whatever god awful resolution it is.
934114	935675	But it's proof it still works.
936519	941551	It's proof it still works.
941551	941892	Anyway.
945031	946011	Ah, let's see.
946011	948492	Looking at chat, it looks like a lot of people laughing along.
948492	950433	sjo100mat says, chef's kiss.
950433	951213	Yes.
951213	955615	So those services, somebody's still running them, whether it's official or not.
955615	956015	All right.
956015	966878	But sadly, no Wii Connect 24 on the Wii U. So I think, you know, in the arms of the angel, that's where the Wii U and 3DS are destined to go.
966878	969699	I mean, I guess, to be fair, I'm not using them a lot.
969699	971860	So I guess I can't say I'm going to miss them.
971860	972040	But
973130	976471	sometimes a throwback would be fun.
976471	977672	All right.
977672	982234	Speaking of throwbacks, let's talk about the types of things we've been playing this week in our gamey weeks.
982234	986976	How was your gamey week where we talk about the games past or present we have been playing in our weeks.
986976	988617	Let's go to DarkSakura to start us off tonight.
988617	990097	How was your gamey week?
990097	993038	I played something different and I played it today.
993038	998601	I played through Raiden Densetsu for Super Famicom because I was just testing it out and I ended up beating it.
1000077	1000717	Hey, P.S.
1000717	1002678	I cheated.
1002678	1007760	I played it in my own personal stress relief mode, and it was great.
1007760	1017323	Although it's so... I was like, I miss my big electric weapon from Raiden 2, plus, you know, the one that goes in twisties and wraps around things.
1017323	1022365	Y'all might have seen it in my little video I made to introduce the Classic Game of the Week.
1022365	1022665	Uh-huh.
1023633	1027457	Um, I also, uh, I beat Live Alive last night.
1027457	1033041	I didn't, you know, get, I did, I, for some reason I didn't grab all of the people.
1033041	1041288	So I didn't get like all of their particular endings, but I did get, I'm going to call it the, the best butt ending.
1041288	1042910	Um, so I did that.
1042910	1046593	So next week, I'm not doing the best butt.
1047185	1053926	Next week, I'm not doing a retro game for Retro Night unless I just play like whatever the fuck I want to, like maybe some Jackie Crush or something.
1053926	1060848	But my next game I'm doing for Retro Night is Magic Knight Rayearth for Super Famicom.
1060848	1069630	So, yeah, I mean, I know we've all seen the Saturn one and those of us who have it never let that go.
1069630	1073010	So but I'm playing the first RPG that came out.
1073010	1075971	You've done Final Fantasy V, second at set to three.
1077108	1077568	Live Alive.
1077568	1082853	So you're doing this trend of games that never came out in America.
1082853	1084574	Or the original versions of them.
1084574	1087036	Well, yeah, because I guess Live Alive technically is out in America now.
1087036	1088237	But yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
1088237	1089038	Final Fantasy 6.
1089038	1090840	I did Final Fantasy 6 and 4.
1090840	1093582	I did translated, unedited ROMs.
1094282	1095543	Oh, that's right.
1095543	1099006	And I do own both Japanese and American copies, so I felt justified.
1099006	1100708	Yeah, of course.
1100708	1107793	And I've done well, actually to play Link to the Past, even though it doesn't really count, but I fucking love that game.
1107793	1109315	I've done Terranigma.
1109315	1110436	I've done Seiken Densetsu 3.
1111216	1113158	Rayearth, Emerald Dragon
1126787	1127788	PC Engine games.
1127788	1129109	I haven't decided.
1129109	1134113	Dan was like, you should go for Mega Drive and do some of the Phantasy Stars.
1134113	1137275	And I'm like, I never played the Phantasy Stars growing up.
1137275	1139196	So I'm sticking with Super Famicom.
1139196	1142139	I'm probably going to, at some point, go back to the original Star Ocean.
1142139	1143520	I haven't decided.
1143520	1146062	But the game I want to play is
1149922	1151223	and LadyStalker.
1166131	1182656	I might just do Dreamlike Valley because it's my cozy vibes game, and I will be still in the middle of getting ready for TwitchCon, which my cosplay is getting to be a lot more of a handful than I thought it was going to be.
1182656	1190138	When I got my seifuku for doing the Tsukiban version of Julie, the schoolgirl outfit,
1191938	1193079	It said it had a blue collar.
1193079	1194620	It had a white collar.
1194620	1196741	And I don't have time to wait for another order.
1196741	1206848	So I'm going to have to figure out how to color it and then get a close up of the kanji on her lapel, because I don't have the way to rip the the files anymore to get that directly.
1206848	1209690	So I might be kind of screwed.
1209690	1212112	So it might just be Pigu this year.
1212112	1213713	I can't believe TwitchCon is in two weeks.
1213713	1214213	My goodness.
1215497	1218279	Yeah, and I get to see TR-ra-ra.
1218279	1219279	That'll be fun.
1219279	1220800	And you get to see TR-ra-ra.
1220800	1221641	I sure hope so.
1221641	1227825	And lots of people on Twitch that, you know, I got to see last year at TwitchCon, a few folks that are returning this year.
1227825	1229226	It'll be nice, you know.
1229226	1231487	Although I don't think LC is going this year.
1231487	1233088	Oh, that's too bad.
1233088	1237511	Yeah, but I mean, we'll have other friends that we'll get to see, so.
1237511	1239412	Make new friends, that's what it's all about.
1239412	1243095	A few people I wanted to see aren't going to make it this year, but might next year.
1243688	1246429	Well, hey, if y'all are going to be in Vegas at TwitchCon, we'll be there.
1246429	1254172	And joined by VOG Network's very own Bobby Blackwolf is also going to be there for his TwitchCon first.
1254172	1258513	He is working with the Games Done Quick mini marathon that's happening at TwitchCon.
1258513	1260334	So that's pretty rad.
1260334	1261554	So.
1261554	1261994	Yeah.
1261994	1267036	We will be there to clap and support and see everything that's at TwitchCon.
1267036	1269777	Well, yeah, I did play Dead by Daylight and Dreamlight Valley.
1269777	1270998	Well, I mean, that goes without saying.
1270998	1271798	Of course.
1271798	1271938	Yeah.
1272348	1273689	All right, then we'll go to Loki.
1273689	1275611	How was your game week?
1275611	1278553	My game week is all Minecraft as usual.
1278553	1281635	We this week we did a little bit something different.
1281635	1285238	We had a booth at a convention.
1285238	1291683	So it's called CubeCon and the convention's entirely in Minecraft, which is kind of fun and it's free for.
1292323	1293543	any way to come visit.
1293543	1298085	So there's different booths that people design and different events going on.
1298085	1302086	I mean, it's basically all the stuff that you would have at a convention.
1302086	1309368	They have speakers, they have like meet and greets, they do games, there's different events and stuff like that.
1309368	1310929	So that was a lot of fun.
1310929	1320892	We were hanging out with different people and checking out some of the mini games and watched a live recording of the Withering Effect podcast and some of that stuff.
1321830	1322831	That's pretty fun.
1322831	1326173	And then just working more on my builds and stuff.
1326173	1329354	Just putting off making video.
1329354	1330695	I have everything ready to go.
1330695	1334677	I just need to sit down, edit, and watch the film stuff too.
1334677	1337799	But the building part's done.
1337799	1340061	So hopefully they'll be done this week.
1342133	1342813	My gaming week.
1342813	1347575	Believe it or not, it might not sound like it, but I was pretty sick this week, actually, because I'm better now.
1347575	1352317	It was just this weird, like, thing that just kind of came and went real quick, but I was really out of it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
1352317	1367542	Like, most of Thursday, I was just kind of sleeping on and off a lot, so I didn't get a lot, a lot of gaming in, but I did get to play some things, such as the new Final Fantasy XIV patch, which I love that there's all this new stuff to do in Island Sanctuary, which is, you know, my favorite part of the game right now.
1367542	1369583	I have to say, the story is...
1370363	1370583	I don't
1392855	1398582	Oh, I have a solution to fix the problem and it involves going back to where we were at in the last expansion.
1398582	1403026	Let's go and let's go revisit all these places and talk to these people we haven't seen in a while.
1403026	1405549	And it just, it just feels like
1406380	1431685	filler content which is weird because usually I sit here and I talk about how 14 has like one of the greatest stories in gaming and I still stand by that for the base expansions but man these latest patches have been a journey like it I guess maybe creatively it was some type of choice because you know if you know you don't already know the Final Fantasy and Walker expansion ended a 10 year story arc that they started in Realm Reborn
1432225	1438370	and in the base patch, the 6.0 patch, they ended the Zodiarch Hydaelyn storyline.
1438370	1446915	So this is all patches leading into what's next, but they're kind of like self-contained, and so that's why I'm like, boy, they feel filler.
1446915	1459744	Like, it's this weird place we're in where it's like, oh, because they ended the main story, and now they're doing a side story, it turns out the side story isn't as interesting, unfortunately, no matter how much retro stuff you throw at it.
1461700	1465363	Hopefully it's something that can be course corrected before the next expansion.
1465363	1470007	Realm Reborn had some really long patch stuff too.
1470007	1472349	But at least, man, there were some really good cutscenes.
1472349	1474591	There were some Game of Thrones level cutscenes.
1474591	1476392	I mean early seasons, not late seasons.
1476392	1480515	There were some good early season cutscenes in the Realm Reborn stuff.
1480515	1486741	So hopefully we can get back to that type of storytelling with the new expansion, but we'll see, we'll see.
1486741	1488142	Otherwise, I've been playing Diablo 3 and 4.
1490143	1496025	3 because I think I talked about on last week's show, I want to see like this last new content that they've made for the game.
1496025	1502486	Because once they go to season 30, they've said the game's on autopilot at that point, they're just going to cycle through old shit at that point.
1502486	1510188	Diablo 4 is more about kind of closing up the books on the first season and getting ready for season two, which is only nine days away.
1510188	1514409	And they announced a lot of like updates for Diablo 4 this week.
1514409	1518730	With that new season, lots of quality of life stuff and things people have been bitching about in general.
1519310	1525814	and I kind of get it like I, I think the internet as usual tends to hate on things more than it deserves.
1525814	1534058	And I don't think Diablo 4 deserves quite the hate that it gets from some but a lot of the concerns have merit.
1534058	1536419	There is some stuff where it's like, okay, they need to iron this out.
1536419	1539521	But you know, you know what else sucked at first to Diablo 3?
1540181	1544022	And it took them a little while to get that right, so I have faith that Diablo 4 is going to get better and better.
1544022	1548244	I enjoyed enough the first season, and I'm really excited about the second season.
1548244	1561409	The only thing that kind of sucks is, the day the second season launches is when I start my trip out of town for LA and then TwitchCon, so I won't be playing Season 2 until a week into it, but that's alright.
1562252	1564434	There's no race, anyway.
1564434	1574903	One other thing that I played this week, and even I surprised myself, but because I was so like, meh, with Final Fantasy XIV right now, I was like, oh yeah.
1576055	1584937	World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King classic started maybe I'll maybe I'll pay for a month to dip my toe in so consider my my toe dipped.
1584937	1587598	I've been playing a little bit I started a blood elf.
1587598	1592479	I have a blood elf priest named honey smacks after the sugar filled cereal.
1592479	1596640	And I'm up to like level 11 I think so.
1596640	1597060	Here's that.
1598022	1602564	I realize they still do not have Dungeon Finder, but they said they're bringing it.
1602564	1609848	They finally said it's coming to WoW Classic, but they've held off on it for a long time because I guess it's controversial.
1609848	1612109	I don't know why, like Dungeon Finder is the best thing.
1612109	1613550	So they need to get on that.
1613550	1614291	I will.
1614291	1622495	I will be going back to WoW as soon as the company is out of a certain somebody's hands, which I think we're talking about it soon, which may be next week.
1624185	1627669	So we'll be until then, not a drop of my money goes to them.
1627669	1628370	Yeah.
1628370	1628630	All right.
1629967	1631048	Uh, well, let's move on.
1631048	1633789	Let's talk about what else is going on in the gaming world.
1633789	1639972	I think I kind of referenced it a little bit ago, but we're going to be gone in two weeks for TwitchCon.
1639972	1645734	So there'll be no show in two weeks, but we will be here next week, um, to wrap up the gaming news.
1645734	1651157	And then we'll, we'll be on break the night of October 22nd due to TwitchCon.
1651157	1651657	Okay.
1651657	1655519	Um, let's get into our first story tonight from Loki.
1656653	1665998	Yeah, this is kind of well, I mean, it's very current considering all of the landscape right now with the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild.
1665998	1669720	You may remember that recently they had voted to
1671138	1685426	allow the union leaders to start a strike against the video game companies for voice acting and motion capture because they are also not paying their fair share of wages.
1685426	1698874	And here is one story from very famous voice actor Jennifer Hale, who went on the My Perfect Console podcast and was discussing the pay
1700642	1704725	the very low pay that she received for working on Metal Gear Solid.
1704725	1716874	It was $1,200, a grotesque disparity saying that with the $176 million that the game made, it's indicative of what's happening in modern culture.
1716874	1722558	For every dollar that the workday person makes, and voice actors are workday people,
1723278	1743476	all actors on camera voiceover whoever are not celebrities and now workday people we make a dollar for every 399 executives make so um so essentially what she's saying is boss makes a dollar i make a dime that's why i poop on company time that's what she's saying right
1744002	1745623	Yeah, to an even greater extent.
1745623	1752049	I think Dollar Diamond nowadays is not even close, like a penny, a fraction of a penny.
1752049	1761277	Even if it's $19.97 or whatever, it's still, yeah, when you put it next to the amount that the game ended up making overall, not cute, not cute.
1762584	1767346	Yeah, this is why you have a lot of actors that want a percentage of gross profits.
1767346	1772368	Like, I want to say Margot Robbie got a gross, I could be wrong, but I don't think I am.
1772368	1778911	Margot Robbie gets a gross of the profits for the Barbie movie, which, as you know, made a shit ton of money.
1778911	1786794	And so, you know, she was an essential part of that movie because I believe she's a co-producer as well, you know, Barbie.
1786794	1790216	So she made quite a bit of money off that, as she should.
1791056	1810682	um because one could argue would that movie have been the same with amy schumer i don't think it would have been so uh you know a lot of the success is owed to that but a lot of the time can you imagine if that's that's the lead that they decided to go with that movie oh that was where it was originally going did she amy schumer was really attached to that why
1811819	1817041	Well, it's because it was before Greta Gerwig was involved or anybody, it radically changed directions.
1817041	1818961	And for the... Have we not learned?
1818961	1820642	I know, I know.
1820642	1833746	Anyway, um, the real point is, you know, with Metal Gear Solid, and you know, Jennifer Hale should be entitled to some percentage of profits, maybe not as much as what Margot Robbie gets off Barbie.
1833746	1839128	But then of course, you know, you look at something like Metal Gear Solid, I would be curious what David Hayter made off of that.
1839368	1840830	Yeah.
1840830	1846536	And don't forget, do not forget Konami screwed him over big time.
1846536	1850280	Remember when they when they got Kiefer Sutherland's going to voice Snake now?
1850280	1852863	Like they didn't even send David Hader a fucking card.
1853574	1862916	What was the point just to get like, nobody, like, honestly, like, I don't even remember that Kiefer Sutherland was Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4 on a normal basis.
1862916	1865877	Like, I don't even think of that anymore, at all.
1865877	1870518	I don't know if it was, one could hypothesize a lot of things.
1870518	1876220	So I'm gonna, I'm gonna give a hypothesis that probably isn't fair, or true.
1876220	1878060	So I'm just gonna say it's a hypothesis.
1879181	1883183	But Kojima seems to be somewhat of a star fucker.
1883183	1890467	And I noticed this in what's happening with like Death Stranding and some of these big names that he's getting in his titles.
1890467	1895069	He very much wants to be a Hollywood director, even though
1895469	1896510	StarfuckerTendencies
1925668	1934213	Well then I'd be curious if that was maybe the case then like what the relationship between David Hathor and Kojima are then.
1934213	1938995	Like if there's like some beef there or if it's just like not that.
1938995	1943358	That'd be kind of more indicative of like what was going on.
1943358	1952783	Also like on top of that you know I'm sure that there's res- I'd hope that there's residuals for these re-releases or remasters or whatever like that because I mean
1954380	1957542	Is anybody getting money from all that stuff when they redo those?
1957542	1958583	Yeah.
1958583	1961124	Go to our chat room at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1961124	1966347	To what you said earlier about the Barbie movie, Loki, when I talked about Amy Schumer being attached, you're like, haven't we learned?
1966347	1968529	Bobby does point out we did learn.
1968529	1971190	That's why she wasn't involved.
1971190	1973852	Well, yeah, I mean, but like to even consider
1975450	1976350	We had to go through a cloud.
1991699	1995362	at any point of the trip is still bad.
1995362	1997763	Yeah, it was Atlanta to Chicago with three layovers.
1997763	1998904	Like it wasn't necessary.
1998904	1999204	All right.
1999204	2001646	Anyway, um, let's see.
2001646	2008951	S2100Matt on a serious note in chat says, I think folks are discovering the harsh reality of how little production staff and actors get.
2008951	2012534	You're seeing VFX artists, visual effects artists, go on strike as well.
2012534	2016917	Low pay, low benefits, low everything, while mediums make massive profits.
2017737	2022939	DarkTetsuya does say a little credit to what I was saying about Kojima saying, I thought that was Kojima's idea.
2022939	2025380	Obviously, I don't know the details.
2025380	2030801	Dijirama S says, what's interesting is that what Konami did is kind of the norm in the voice acting industry.
2030801	2036623	And the thing is that when it happens, it's too late because 99% of voice roles are coded that you don't know.
2036623	2041125	Well, I mean, look at what happened with the Silent Hill HD remaster.
2041125	2041725	Remember that?
2042585	2049491	and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I don't think Kojima saw it as beef, he just saw it as a way to get a AAA actor in his game.
2058039	2072484	Kojima thought is that I'm saying there would be some tension in the relationship between David Hayter and Kojima based off of the decision not to cast him in another game with the character that he's been, you know, voicing for years now.
2072484	2078826	That's what I was saying is like, is there any beef now between the two, like any tension because of that?
2078826	2083288	And that would be more indicative of maybe what the motivations were, unless he just doesn't know.
2083288	2086229	And maybe he's just a very professional actor and is like,
2087225	2088027	Yeah, that's fine.
2088027	2095001	You know, I think, though, that he was outspoken about that when that time came, so I don't think he took it lightly.
2096345	2100787	Dark2C in chat says, I know Hater still does the Solid Snake appearances, so I'm not sure.
2100787	2105889	Well, I mean, Charles Martinet still does Mario appearances, and you know, it's true for movies, too.
2105889	2115972	Robert England still makes Buku Bucks doing Freddy, even though technically they replaced him, too, which was a questionable decision in and of itself, but it is what it is.
2115972	2121274	I'm just saying the same thing happens in Hollywood, and people will make convention appearances based on their old rules.
2121274	2122395	Or look at somebody like
2123335	2150960	Julie Newmar is it I think will still do the occasional convention appearance and sign your sign things as Catwoman well not during the strike but you know before that whole thing happened and obviously there's been like seven other folks that have played Catwoman since then but Julie Newmar is one of the all time greats so you know there's that so you know this it is interesting no video game video game voice actors will still absolutely cash in on some of those roles that they played why shouldn't they well
2151323	2156867	What's her name that voiced Bayonetta before Jennifer Hale did?
2156867	2157647	Oh God, what was her name?
2157647	2161910	Remember, she made those horrible videos trying to get the sympathy and we all saw right through it.
2161910	2162511	That bitch?
2162511	2163371	Yeah, her.
2163371	2164352	Her, period.
2164352	2166574	I don't even remember her name.
2166574	2171237	You know she's going to make as much money as possible off of that because that's all she's ever going to have now.
2171237	2172638	She showed her entire butt on that one.
2173395	2175456	Anyway, all right.
2175456	2181040	Anyway, but back to the main point, voice actors shouldn't have to rely on convention appearances.
2181040	2197409	But if you do feel some sort of way if you do feel the voice actor should be paid more, then don't bitch when you go to a convention and it's why do they charge 60 bucks for a selfie like a selfie should be like five bucks if even that why it's promo for them.
2197409	2198330	It's okay.
2199289	2206664	you don't get to say voice actors are grossly underpaid and then complain about one of their biggest sources of income at this point.
2206664	2207766	Like pick your battle.
2207766	2207987	Also,
2209027	2211828	Bruce Campbell at the Crest Theater
2238712	2240493	Do you know why I did this?
2240493	2241913	I had to pay for my house.
2241913	2243233	You know, just different things like that.
2243233	2249315	It's like, it's like, yeah, I like to do, you know, some of them because they're, you know, they're good money.
2249315	2250215	They're fun shows.
2250215	2252576	But in the end, it's a job.
2252576	2255217	Going to these appearances are a job.
2255217	2259998	It is part of the job you have as an independent contractor, basically.
2261097	2262859	Bruce Campbell is a great example of that.
2262859	2269647	Literally anybody Star Trek, anybody Star Trek from a bit player all the way up to Bill Shatner.
2269647	2270428	Any of them.
2270428	2272110	That's exactly that, right?
2273398	2274018	You can't say that.
2274018	2275879	Lemmy Shatner did do TJ Hooker as well.
2275879	2276320	That's true.
2276320	2279701	And that recent show where all the celebrities went to Mars, but it wasn't really Mars.
2279701	2280662	It was just a soundstage.
2280662	2281322	Like, what was that?
2281322	2281702	What was it?
2281702	2283263	This is what happens when the writers go on stage.
2283263	2283803	I don't know.
2283803	2286745	I don't keep up with him anymore just because of his comments about lots of people.
2286745	2287785	No, I know.
2287785	2289026	He's not great.
2289026	2294269	But I mean, he's he is an example of somebody who makes buku bucks off conventions and all this other stuff.
2294269	2296350	So anyway.
2296350	2297110	All right.
2297110	2297570	Let's talk.
2297570	2299291	I guess as we're talking about Konami franchises.
2299291	2300612	Cisco is still the best captain.
2301470	2310373	Let's talk about I, I'm still kind of partial like for me, Disco took a long time to get there.
2310373	2316555	I'm still and I also I'm always going to be partial to Georgiou when it comes to Disco.
2316555	2319336	But I'm going to always be Discovery.
2319336	2320137	Yeah.
2320137	2323298	I'm always going to be partial partial partial to Janeway.
2323298	2326239	Like that's just like there's there's never going to be another better captain.
2326239	2326859	I'm sorry.
2326859	2328980	It's all about a captain named Hawk.
2328980	2329400	All right.
2329400	2329920	Anyway, you
2330374	2333115	The moment that he got the hawk look back, it was on.
2348693	2351135	No, I mean, it's a pinnacle.
2351135	2366404	Well, what's interesting, if we can go on a Trekkie binge for a minute here, DSpace9 is experiencing this very interesting renaissance because of streaming, because now people can view it as the one large story arc.
2366404	2368946	It was kind of, well, you know what I mean?
2368946	2374910	Larger story arc other than, you know, Peril of the Week, people can view it as it was kind of intended.
2375350	2377271	And it's catching more people now.
2377271	2379232	They did a whole documentary on this.
2379232	2382454	This whole, like, new resurgence of Deep Space Nine.
2382454	2385916	And there's plenty of people that would side with you, DarkSakura.
2385916	2389157	Deep Space Nine being the pinnacle of Star Trek is an uncontroversial opinion.
2389157	2391538	Like, there's a lot of people that would side with you.
2391538	2398262	One of the big things about it that divides people is that it was one of the, I'm just gonna say, post-Roddenberry series.
2399436	2406598	And it veers away from this, oh, beautiful utopia and we're all perfect and prime directive and blah, blah, blah.
2406598	2412320	It shows what happens when you take away the utopia.
2412320	2413560	What are people like?
2413560	2415081	They went back during World War Three.
2415581	2417682	They're in the middle of a war.
2417682	2424485	You see people, you know, betraying their own morals to save lives in a war.
2424485	2428267	And so it's... I love it.
2428267	2432509	It was probably one of the most real and departure series of all of them.
2432509	2434930	And it belongs in my heart forever.
2434930	2436731	And you know what?
2436731	2438572	When everyone's gone, Morn will still be there.
2439721	2440261	That's so funny.
2440261	2445405	I thought you said disco at first you met Michael Burnham because she's a really good character.
2445405	2449307	But but like, it's Discovery's just weird.
2449307	2451289	It's a weirdly paced show.
2451289	2454371	Because now that's a show that's made for streaming.
2454371	2458793	So it's almost like you have these 13 hour movies that really set up the story there.
2458793	2461575	And there's just these jarring differences between the different seasons.
2461575	2463977	But anyway, I guess I'll save that for another day.
2463977	2464217	All right.
2465781	2472187	I want to do a group watch and just start at the beginning of Deep Space Nine.
2472187	2475410	Oh, nobody's ever done that podcast.
2475410	2476371	I'm not saying it's a podcast.
2476371	2478613	I just want to watch it.
2478613	2481255	Or do a best episode.
2481255	2486280	Have everyone in the group pick their favorite episode and then we sit and watch it.
2486280	2488222	And also, I still love Esri, so shut up.
2489564	2495231	I'm also sad that I don't have a new Silent Hill game to play, but it seems like that dry streak might be coming to an end soon because apparently
2508668	2512312	Silent Hill Ascension, which is one of the multiple silent games they've announced.
2512312	2514834	This is not the new PlayStation 5 game.
2514834	2516916	This is not the 2 remake.
2516916	2522761	Silent Hill Ascension is that mini-series, the interactive mini-series that I want to say Behavior was involved with.
2524513	2528234	but it looked a little more like Until Dawn or one of those types of games.
2528234	2534655	Apparently a listing on Google Play says that this mini series is coming October 31.
2534655	2537276	What an appropriate day that would be.
2537276	2538556	Could that be a placeholder date?
2538556	2546978	Who knows because the producers and developers of Silent Hill Ascension have not said they haven't confirmed if this is the date that it would launch, but that would be kind of rad.
2547578	2552219	Silent Hill Ascension is going to be an interactive live-action series where viewers decide on the outcome.
2552219	2565523	It's being developed by Bad Robot Production Company, that means JJ Abrams, King of the Lens Flares, and yes, Dead by Daylight Studio, Behavior Interactive, and Genvid, I hope I said that right, Entertainment, are all participating in that.
2566523	2569585	Yeah, bring on- remember that Silent Hill thing earlier this year?
2569585	2573587	And it was like, you get a Silent Hill and you get a Silent Hill, you all get a Silent Hill.
2573587	2577389	It's like, okay, now let's see those games because there's a lot of good stuff in there.
2577389	2579771	I really want that 2 remake, to be honest.
2579771	2581872	And the Silent Hill F looks sweet.
2581872	2582552	So.
2582552	2588135	I want a completely, completely redone Silent Hill 3, please.
2588135	2591237	Or another game with Heather that isn't Dead by Daylight.
2593030	2600153	All right, uh, let's move on in I can't believe it, but I kind of can, DarkSakura.
2600153	2602553	Well, there's a claim out there.
2602553	2604834	Okay, well, let's take a step back.
2604834	2607475	Lord of the Rings Golem sucked.
2607475	2614878	It, it was plagued by just lazy, lazy programming.
2614878	2621160	Um, you know, and also the fact that somebody thought it was a good idea to make a game out of Golem.
2624067	2631930	Yeah, well, the other thing, I mean, there were scenes that were created and then they couldn't complete, so they just had Gollum watching it while they played the audio.
2631930	2633430	You know, it's just terrible.
2633430	2646435	Well, they, the thing is, is that because the apology needed to be said, you know, it was, uh, you know, Daedalic didn't have anything to do with it in particular.
2647655	2652878	It's said that it was written by ChatGPT.
2652878	2664083	That was said by a couple of the previous employees there who worked on the game.
2664083	2669505	And that basically, Daedlic had no knowledge of the Apology or what was included on it.
2669505	2672827	It was handled by the publisher, Nacon.
2672827	2674748	So, yeah.
2677215	2683077	Again, AI, don't rely on AI.
2683077	2685298	Have people write stuff.
2685298	2688319	Check out that completely empty environment in this game.
2688319	2690359	It's very, very fascinating to me anyway.
2693386	2695227	You know what I bet happened here?
2695227	2697628	You know, it's it's interesting, because again, it's a claim.
2697628	2700128	So they can't prove that ChatGBT wrote it.
2700128	2702289	So you know, but I guess it's insider whatever.
2702289	2703370	I'm gonna try something.
2703370	2705290	I'm gonna pull it up and say, write me an apology.
2705290	2706671	Write me an apology.
2706671	2707831	I'm gonna do it.
2707831	2711233	You should tell ChatGBT to write an apology for existing.
2711233	2711873	Here's the thing, though.
2712793	2717194	I, and people have been using ChatGBT for this a lot.
2717194	2722456	I wonder if someone didn't say, start me off, help me write an apology.
2722456	2731358	And then probably somebody went through and, you know, tweaked it a little bit so that it didn't completely sound AI written, because this is a very common thing people do now.
2731358	2738320	But it also goes to show that there is, you know, because we've been hearing about all these layoffs within the game industry.
2739318	2743121	And I don't know to what extent either of these companies has a PR department.
2743121	2749006	I can't imagine it's very large because these are two companies you've only really heard bad news about.
2749006	2751228	So they can't have very large PR team.
2751228	2758014	And I wonder if they're thinking, oh, ChatGPT is a substitute for PR, which unfortunately, we all know the answer.
2758014	2758774	No, it is not.
2758774	2759595	Yes, it is.
2759595	2760956	But just a bad substitute.
2760956	2763278	Well, unfortunately, I am not signing up, by the way.
2763278	2764199	They want my phone number.
2764199	2765059	And the answer is no.
2765059	2765620	You get
2765920	2767802	Crap goes in, crap goes out?
2795733	2797555	You're gonna get what you pay for.
2797555	2804280	And now now here's this headline continuing to dump on this company that's already had a bad year.
2804280	2805942	Yeah.
2805942	2809444	But I mean, they still should have known better.
2809444	2809765	Yeah.
2809765	2816330	sg100mattinchat says I could have sworn I said that their statements sounded like a canned copy paste we're sorry response.
2816330	2816951	Well, to be fair,
2817910	2835503	most of the internet was also saying that it did feel very copypasta that white text on a black background type of apology we've come to accept that yes, chat GPT or any AI probably learned from all these other companies and then presto.
2835503	2836344	Why not?
2836344	2841207	Twitter now apparently will learn AI from your tweets now.
2841207	2845830	That's a thing that just happened in the last month that your terms of service there now allow
2846929	2851672	Xcorp to use your tweets to do that whole thing.
2851672	2854493	So that's- I need to go back and delete all of them.
2854493	2858736	Another- I'm going through that slow, slow removal.
2858736	2860117	Yeah.
2860117	2861557	All right.
2861557	2865079	Let's move on to other brands we love.
2865079	2866880	Loki.
2866880	2872103	This is- We've got a whole string, because we've got another story after this.
2872103	2873364	It's like, what about this brand?
2873364	2874345	All right, so Loki-
2875369	2883640	So this isn't necessarily a new thing for this brand being Shell Oil, Shell being a major
2884414	2887655	Shell Ultimate Road Trips
2915858	2921345	energy sources, you know, that may be more renewable, less like, you know, awful for the planet.
2921345	2923287	But there's already is for gasoline.
2923287	2924269	You can put it in your car.
2924269	2925029	You can inhale it.
2925029	2927052	You don't do that at home, kids.
2928149	2951388	Apparently, the website Media Matters has identified at least a half a dozen streamers, including folks with Punisher, NateHill, Chica, and Brekeb, who have a combined Twitch following of 5.5 million subscribers, helped promote this Fortnite map and the Fossil Fuels during sponsored streams that had millions of views on it.
2952153	2956095	Now, my first disappointment wasn't necessarily from this.
2956095	2964741	It's actually, even before this, also using another... I'm going to say, like, celebrity influencer.
2964741	2973546	She's not so much of an influencer right now, but she is... Carrie Bryan, who was on Mythbusters, if you may remember.
2973546	2978189	A very big proponent of, like, clean energy and all that stuff.
2979235	2985978	immediate shill now for shell made multiple videos now promoting their stuff.
2985978	2993781	I mean, granted, it's a paid job, but it's like goes very much against like your morals in this sense.
2993781	2996082	But yeah, the morals are for sale.
2996902	3000404	Of course, you know, it's a tough market out there right now.
3000404	3013492	Apparently the creators, the Shell Gasoline propaganda have combined the audience of 8.5 million TikTok followers, 1.5 million Instagram followers and 11 million YouTube subscribers.
3013492	3017655	They also paid for a sponsored post on IGN.
3017655	3019936	We know IGN is trash anyway, so there you go.
3022654	3033136	and uh yeah so apparently though the good thing at least with that is people aren't necessarily just going okay i'll use more gas i mean
3034304	3041431	Shell's super expensive anyways, like even if you are going to use gas, you're probably not buying Shell anyways, unless it's all that's available.
3041431	3048357	But apparently, people have been making lots of comments- Why is Shell Gasoline partnering with like Fortnite streamers?
3048357	3051400	Why wouldn't you partner with like Disney Speedstorm?
3051400	3054603	And then it could be like the the the smell of Autotopia.
3054943	3069017	because whenever you go to that ride at Disneyland it's like you get a gas high like you cannot go to Autotopia or I think actually at one point that fucking ride was Chevron Presents Autotopia and it smelled like Chevron all over the fucking ground.
3069017	3072100	Carbon Monoxia.
3072100	3074882	The land of Carbon Monoxia.
3074882	3077085	I think, is she a Disney princess?
3079327	3085613	I think a lot of those sponsored items were there at first just to keep the park running, but yeah.
3085613	3089176	Exactly, and a lot of it was just, yeah, just to kind of help with that.
3089176	3100147	I mean, it's a staple, but yeah, it's a staple that smells like, you know, a mini golf go-kart track with a bunch of... At the back of a truck stop.
3100768	3117585	yeah it's pretty because you know like even at like say like a indy golf course where they have go karts and stuff and that's kind of smelly there but like imagine you tent you you up the amount of cars tenfold it's pretty bad but yeah that aside um
3118723	3125210	Apparently though, at least with that, it seems like that the target demographic for this isn't buying their crap.
3125210	3129274	They understand that like, I don't trust seeing you big oil company.
3129274	3130395	I'm sorry.
3130395	3132297	That's not gonna happen.
3132297	3138423	Um, QuestBuster in chat says wait time for carbon monoxia is 45 minutes.
3138423	3140065	Please breathe responsibly.
3143113	3148990	uh yeah and on top of that there's the law here that we're not going to be able to buy gas cars
3151258	3155442	I mean, eventually, eventually, I think the writing is on the wall for them.
3155442	3156723	I think for sure.
3156723	3161487	Once we just need to get more adoption for it and the infrastructure built out for electric vehicles.
3161487	3164030	But yeah, I mean, it's not going to be fossil fuels forever.
3164030	3165491	It can't.
3165491	3174239	That's the problem, though, is this company is willing to pivot back to gasoline over like researching cleaner energy sources because that's what they have.
3174239	3177062	And they feel that, hey, if I throw enough money at this problem,
3177602	3180184	then we're just not gonna be obsolete.
3180184	3182286	But I don't know if that's the case.
3182286	3192035	Also, I don't know if like, through Fortnite, that's really like, your best angle, like, are people really gonna see this and go, you know, gasoline sounds pretty good.
3192035	3193936	I'm just not gonna buy an electric car.
3193936	3196339	I'm gonna go to Shell because I saw it in Fortnite.
3197007	3198168	Like, I don't know.
3198168	3201730	I'm going to open up the app that tells me where the cheap piss gas is.
3201730	3203471	That's what I'm going to go put in my car.
3203471	3204251	Exactly.
3204251	3210695	You're going to you're going to drive up the shell and you're going to say, hmm, their gas is like six dollars and 50 cents a gallon.
3210695	3214017	Whereas across the street, it's only like five dollars a gallon.
3214017	3215277	Yeah.
3215277	3216418	Literally, I am.
3216418	3220060	I will put Costco piss gas in my car every time because you know what?
3220902	3222344	It works doesn't matter.
3222344	3222945	It doesn't matter.
3222945	3224006	I have a hybrid anyway.
3224006	3225968	It only it's only half gas anyway.
3225968	3234979	What's what's great too is on their website they talk about like so the shell website actually has this ultimate road trip saying talking about like Fortnite and stuff like that.
3234979	3236521	Explore the island of Fortnite.
3236521	3237542	Get ready for an adventure.
3237542	3239625	It's all about speed, acceleration, performance and
3239745	3242666	powered by Shell V-Powered Nitro Plus.
3242666	3247047	Okay, first off, that's a really awful name for the gas, like Shell V-Powered Nitro Plus.
3247047	3248988	What is this, Street Fighter 2?
3248988	3250168	Premium Gasoline.
3250168	3258811	And then right below that it says, this is an ad, this is fantasy, this isn't a real performance about Shell V-Powered Nitro Plus Premium Gasoline.
3258811	3265853	Shell's going to need to get out of this and they're going to need to pivot to something a little more wholesome and contributing to society like cigarettes and alcohol.
3270741	3273002	We're going to get Shell gasoline flavored vapes.
3273002	3278044	How much how how much money would Shell have to pay us for us to rebrand the show?
3278044	3281485	Shell presents Orange Lounge Radio.
3281485	3282666	I don't know.
3282666	3286648	I think we would end before something like that happened.
3286648	3287428	I think so, too.
3288971	3293113	Anyway, our next story tonight on Intellivision Amico presents Orange Lounge Radio.
3293113	3293593	No, I'm kidding.
3293593	3294073	I'm kidding.
3294073	3294513	I'm kidding.
3294513	3300376	But you know, it's a completely have no money completely uncontroversial brands.
3300376	3304537	This is one of those of course, of course type of stories.
3304537	3310640	Astro smash, you know, the classic Intellivision title that they were reimagining at one point for the Intellivision Amico.
3311180	3323873	Well, if this isn't news that the Intellivision Amico is surely to come out before I die, it turns out Astro Smash is coming to the Nintendo Switch on October 12th, next week.
3323873	3324994	That's right.
3324994	3326115	That's an actual console.
3326555	3347427	get ready to unleash your inner astronaut in the space epic game look the old school astronaut is fine or astronaut old school astro smash is fine and it's basically you know the same thing reimagine whatever this but this is the game they've been showing a lot of footage for and really pushing for the amico it's not the first one to come out for the switch but this is is this the first
3349141	3349962	Intellivision
3371575	3372676	I don't think the Amico's still...
3389773	3410798	like being worked on anymore like I like I'm there's confusing there's are they saying that they're really going to like actually try to use this to fund us why just don't stop just I see you remember that was an old thing they were trying to do was they were going to use the games to try to leverage the Amico or something
3411364	3414746	I bet people felt really great about pre-ordering all those games.
3414746	3417988	You got your wonderful NFT thing.
3417988	3418889	That works.
3418889	3421230	It's going to work great when that console comes out.
3421230	3426673	So to answer your question, because I actually did do a little research on this earlier today.
3426673	3428394	So, you know, I love to bring the receipts.
3428394	3435879	So what I'm showing on the other screen right now is I'm showing the Intellivision.com website, which is still pushing the Amico as if it's a thing that's going to happen.
3436540	3444401	and again to help fund you know all we have to sell literally anything limited collectors boxed edition bundles
3445402	3454127	Each boxed edition comes with a 3D card, a metal coin, an RFID game card that will automatically activate once the title is available.
3454127	3460611	So these are literally boxes with no game inside of them, but someday a game will magically appear.
3460611	3471016	And if you want to buy a collection of these games for your own, which by the way, do not seem to include Astro Blaster anymore now that I'm looking at it, you can get a pack of four for $80.
3473720	3475704	Don't do it.
3475704	3475804	It's...
3483972	3486094	I can't believe they still have that on their website.
3504394	3516204	like this is going to be like a CDI and like Philips CDI systems now they're worth something because it was so notoriously bad now it's worth something so that's what I felt the Amico was worth hanging on to.
3518745	3521186	I have one we were gonna get Ben Heck to fix it.
3521186	3526547	Yeah, but now that's the literally $100 that Tommy Tallarico stole from me.
3526547	3528468	So is it is what it is.
3528468	3534649	This is why I should learn my lesson every fucking time that I shouldn't back these things.
3534649	3535550	And I do.
3535550	3538771	And then, you know, I got my clown dress on tonight.
3538771	3539831	Here we are.
3539831	3544552	So anyway, crowdfunding doesn't work for the most part.
3544552	3547813	That said, there are some things I do want to
3548825	3550967	be a part of crowdfunding wise.
3550967	3559534	We'll talk about that a little bit later, but... Hey, I've got the three things that I put my money into for crowdfunding, I got back.
3559534	3569562	I got my Hot Toful Boyfriend plushies, my Dead by Daylight board game, and... Oh, Bloodstained.
3569562	3571043	Yeah, I back that one too, I guess.
3571043	3576967	But anyway, let's talk about a game whose prospects are perhaps a little more realistic.
3576967	3577588	DarkSakura.
3579355	3589230	So I'm only bringing this one up because my spouse is totally into iRacing.
3589230	3593757	He had that big racing rig built that he would play all the sim racing and iRacing stuff.
3594318	3601042	Well, now iRacing officially has NASCAR's console video game license from Motorsport Games.
3601042	3609227	It is a massive shake-up, and specifically for the sim-style console racing games.
3609227	3614430	But yeah, they are taking it over.
3614430	3616131	They are hoping that
3617392	3632136	Well, actually, what's going to happen is that 704 Games, which is a subsidiary of Motorsport Games, is going to be transferring the licensing to iRacing so that they are going to be able to do, like I said, console games.
3632136	3637357	Until now, they've only pretty much been computer sim racing.
3637357	3638058	So, yeah.
3640252	3656630	Hopefully that will, you know, for everyone who likes to be a fun sim racer and people who wanted to get into it but can't necessarily swing the big-ass, you know, rig that's needed, maybe this is gonna be a good step into sim racing for people by, um...
3657854	3660395	by getting into the console market.
3660395	3663335	So kudos.
3663335	3676198	Dan's rig was really cool, but we've seen people who had racing rigs that were hydraulic and had full-on force feedback and were like a pod, even built into a car before.
3676198	3681379	I've seen one that was built into a Formula One car, or at least the cockpit of one.
3681379	3685200	And yeah, it's pretty big.
3685200	3685640	So there you go.
3686400	3687261	Nice.
3687261	3691706	I have to admit, not a series I know a lot about, but interesting.
3691706	3700176	As Jonah and Matt does kind of, you know, back that up saying iRacing eSports does get a legit audience, so smart on them for getting involved in it.
3700176	3704240	Quest Pressure says iRacing did make big waves during the pandemic with NASCAR 2.
3704240	3706683	Seems like that partnership really worked out for them.
3706683	3707264	Yep.
3707264	3707444	Yeah.
3708218	3708598	All right.
3708598	3709699	Everybody else take notes.
3709699	3735995	Well, and on top of that, if they start bringing in like more, uh, more deals with like companies like Fanatic, for example, that makes all those really good racing wheels and, and rig parts, you know, and then slapping on like maybe an official NASCAR thing in conjunction with this and that, that's going to really be, you know, there's a lot of opportunities there, I think, for NASCAR, uh, being involved with such a dedicated sim racing, uh, company.
3735995	3736215	All right.
3737682	3740428	All right, well, let's move on.
3740428	3741832	Loki, what do you have for us?
3741832	3743055	Sony was hacked again.
3743055	3744097	Yeah, I know.
3744097	3745801	It's like we just talked about this last week.
3745801	3747344	We literally just talked about this last week.
3747344	3747485	Yeah.
3748227	3752608	But yeah, they're like, yeah, you know how we might have been hacked?
3752608	3755929	Well, we also got hacked back in May, too.
3755929	3757830	We just didn't say anything about it.
3757830	3767032	So they apparently sent out a notice to Sony employees saying that there was a hack back in May that involved the personal data of nearly 6,800
3769984	3796581	current and former employees and apparently this was a breach that occurred on May 28th before the exploit was fixed and it led to personal information of thousands of employees at Sony Interactive Entertainment to be compromised and the company is offering the complimentary Equifax Complete Premier Credit Monitoring and Identity Restoration services to those affected.
3798155	3806925	How wonderful of them considering that Equifax was also, you know, didn't they have all their stuff breached as well?
3806925	3810929	So like, you know, should we really be trusting them with that?
3810929	3815674	It's weird because I feel like this isn't getting a lot of traction out there.
3816818	3830109	as compared to, and I mean, I realize because this is more employee-based and it's not like user-based, like I do understand all of that, but it does seem weird to me that this doesn't seem to be gaining a lot of traction out there.
3830109	3834813	Yeah, I would say this is worse than the previous one, because at least the previous one is like, ah, it's Sony IP stuff.
3834813	3835494	Okay, who cares?
3835494	3836475	You know, that's fine.
3836475	3837555	Yeah.
3837555	3840418	But this is like actual employees and people being affected by it.
3840418	3845322	Like one is affecting the executives and their bottom line, one's affecting like the common employee, like
3846725	3850386	I feel more about the you know, employees instead.
3850386	3853047	Yeah.
3853047	3858209	Matt says look forward to that free game in six months the PS plus before the inevitable class action suite suit.
3858209	3860470	Well, is that what they're going to give the employees because they're the ones?
3860470	3861950	No, just credit monitoring.
3861950	3862711	Yeah, that's it.
3862711	3863071	That's it.
3863071	3863751	Credit monitoring.
3863751	3864231	Hard.
3864231	3866272	Nothing.
3866272	3868012	A pat on the ass and job well done.
3868012	3869193	That's what they get.
3869193	3869453	All right.
3870603	3871283	And that sucks, too.
3871283	3872384	It's former employees, too.
3872384	3875706	Can you imagine you left Sony and you're like, all right, I've done that.
3875706	3879148	And it's like, oh, hey, by the way, yeah.
3879148	3882650	I literally know somebody I could ask about this.
3882650	3886292	I literally know somebody I could ask about exactly that.
3887903	3888843	not going to go there.
3888843	3889483	All right.
3889483	3893324	Anyway, let's talk about this is interesting.
3893324	3894605	Atari news.
3894605	3903087	Now look, we talk on the show a lot about retro games kind of getting, you know, like newer 2600 homebrew games getting released, right?
3903087	3908988	Like there's still a community out there using that machine language to write, you know, 2600 games and releasing games for Atari.
3908988	3910989	So we know this is a whole thing out there.
3910989	3915050	But what I think is interesting here is we have now a case of Atari themselves
3915810	3922755	releasing a game, a new game for the 2600 which is of course 46 years old at this point.
3922755	3926058	The new game that's coming out is called Save Mary.
3926058	3934864	Now this game was being developed around the time that you know Atari went belly up all those years ago but now it's being brought back to light.
3934864	3940368	We've seen a few games like you know like Yars' Revenge 2 and some of these other games we've seen but this is you know kind of interesting.
3940368	3942590	Save Mary was in development for two years
3943310	3946452	That was a fucking long time in the Atari 2600 era.
3946452	3948073	Don't forget, games like E.T.
3948073	3949753	were made in six weeks.
3949753	3952075	So a game being in development two years?
3952075	3952535	Unheard of.
3953822	3958724	Um, but Save Mary was, uh, originally made by Todd Fry.
3958724	3964066	That is the guy who made the 2600 version of Pac-Man, for better or for worse.
3964066	3965947	For better because he- He did what he could.
3965947	3967067	Yeah, he did what he could.
3967067	3971989	For better because he pulled it off, for worse because they wouldn't let him have an 8K cartridge to do it.
3971989	3980733	Uh, but Todd Fry, probably more notably known for the Sword Quest series, which, you know, was a great series and, you know, huge, uh, uh, cult audience there.
3981434	3983240	If you want to buy this game, it'll cost you $60.
3986230	3990173	but that's also what these games used to cost back in the day, I suppose.
3990173	3994076	You get a silver... Also, making carts is... it is more expensive.
3994076	3995557	It's not cheap, yeah.
3995557	3999860	$60 will get you a silver collector's edition box, a full-color manual.
3999860	4002702	You don't see that with games anymore, so that's kind of nice to see.
4002702	4004423	And the game itself.
4004423	4009667	Only 500 of these are being made, so they're kind of looking at it as a collector's item as well.
4009667	4013230	And in the game Save Mary, you have to... well, guess what?
4013230	4014051	Save Mary.
4015152	4023379	There's a canyon that's filling up with water and you use a crane to build platforms to help Mary get out of the water or whatever it is.
4023379	4026442	Power-ups will show up on the cliff to help you out.
4026442	4038172	Atari's founder, Nolan Bushnell, in a 1989 interview said it was the, quote, first game in which you rely on construction rather than destruction to save the princess.
4039197	4042319	Interesting.
4042319	4048223	There's other titles that have been out, Mr. Run and Jump or lost games like Aquaventure.
4048223	4054007	But yeah, this is one that really, you know, up to exact standards like the old games.
4054007	4059971	It is of note that Atari, as we've talked about on the show previously, is about to launch their 2600 plus
4061692	4064594	that is designed to play old Atari games.
4064594	4071979	So one could argue that this game being released is kind of interestingly timed with that 2600 plus on the horizon.
4071979	4079104	You know, even if there are only 500 copies, there'll be people that, you know, want to grab this and perhaps play it on their 2600 plus.
4079104	4086730	Although if you're going to buy one of 500 copies of a game, you're probably playing it on your OG Atari 2600, honestly, because those things are built like a truck and still work.
4086730	4087310	Most of them.
4087310	4088431	I'm going to dub that thing.
4088752	4090634	Oh, well, of course, that'll be it.
4090634	4094359	The ROM will be out in moments, but you're not buying this because... Woodpanel glory.
4094359	4095921	Yeah, yeah.
4095921	4096802	Anyway.
4096802	4097543	All right.
4097543	4103530	Well, what an appropriate setup for a all time favorite segment here at Orange Lawns Radio, our next segment.
4114186	4121931	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4121931	4125834	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4125834	4128135	And what did you pick for us tonight, DarkSakura?
4128135	4132138	Oh, Tiger Claw already spoiled it for us.
4132138	4133699	Oh no.
4133699	4135761	No, unwittingly.
4135761	4138843	It's Aliens, the 1990 arcade version.
4140372	4145956	So basically, it is a running gun game that was produced for arcades by Konami.
4145956	4152580	It's based off of, of course, the movie from 1986, the James Cameron masterpiece.
4152580	4159665	But it is side-scrolling shooter where you play Ripley with a Gatling gun, or more like the flamethrower gun thingy.
4160685	4172156	And some parts also go third person, but you play either as Ripley or Hicks, who have their smart gun and have to upgrade their weapons.
4172156	4175298	You know, for example, flamethrowers, missiles, grenade launchers.
4175298	4185888	You have health points, and if they're lost, you, well, I mean, if you get hit by an alien, you lose points, and then, you know, you're out if all your lives are defeated.
4187089	4194681	You've got boss enemies, and of course the final boss is the Alien Queen, and you use the power loader.
4194681	4196243	That's awesome.
4196243	4199008	There is a two-player mode where you can play as Hicks and Ripley.
4202132	4211522	You have all kinds of aliens that you go against, just like the drones in the movie, but there's also, like, the different various versions of them.
4211522	4216827	You see, this was prophetic for all the different ones they're coming out with for Alien Covenant and all that.
4216827	4221572	I like how it has real Contra energy, which was funny because Contra basically stole from Aliens.
4221572	4222573	It's like full circle now.
4223367	4225929	Yeah, yeah.
4225929	4230033	But also, you have two different endings for the game.
4230033	4241962	So when you're fighting the Queen, you can do it by opening the airlock, or you can basically fight the Queen until she bursts apart.
4242723	4245264	And sometimes that's satisfactory.
4245264	4251907	I hate the cover for this because they use some generic blonde lady and this brunette kid is as mute.
4251907	4257390	And I mean, you see in the game, you know, she's blonde, but that that's not Ripley.
4257390	4264353	No, you must emulate as much as possible that hardcore Sigourney Weaver action, just saying.
4265673	4268935	The game did have a worldwide release.
4268935	4273997	Its debut was at the Amusement Trades Exhibition International in London.
4273997	4282761	In Japan, it was exhibited at the AOU in February 1990 and received a wide release in March 1990.
4282761	4291546	North American debut was at Chicago's American Coin Machine Exhibition, or ACMI, that same month.
4293987	4302212	It was declared that it was the best new conversion kit at the Acme Show by Replay Magazine and other distributors.
4302212	4308135	It won a silver award from the American Amusement Machine Association for sales achievement.
4308135	4315240	It was the second best-selling arcade machine that year after another Konami game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
4316973	4326215	In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their April 15, 1990 issue as the second most successful table arcade game, arcade unit of the month.
4326215	4329996	It got very positive reviews.
4329996	4334317	Computer and video games gave it a 91%.
4334317	4335598	Power Play said positive.
4335598	4337838	All Game gave it a 3.5 out of 5.
4337838	4338578	I mean,
4341279	4345281	A lot of people said that it was, you know, nice and gory.
4345281	4354367	It was even quoted as being brilliant graphics and described as one of the goriest coin-ops since Splatterhouse.
4354367	4364893	So, now, the only ones who gave it really bad ratings was CU Amiga because they thought it was bland and drab in the graphics and unresponsive and dull, but I mean,
4366454	4367755	This game is anything but.
4367755	4369376	It's pretty fast-paced.
4369376	4373019	It's a challenging, fun game.
4373019	4384389	And even, you know, a while later, Retro Gamer, their editor-in-chief, still said it was a superb game, even today, that's one of the must-plays of the Alien franchise.
4384389	4386290	And so, that's it.
4386290	4387311	Aliens.
4387311	4389453	With a blonde Ripley, for some reason.
4391448	4398295	5th Dream in chat says we had that in our high school cafeteria.
4398295	4400117	I played it daily.
4400117	4402880	Philof9 says Ripley in parachute pants.
4402880	4404442	MikeDef says I remember playing this.
4406724	4407625	The jumpsuit.
4407625	4409627	I remember playing this in the arcade.
4409627	4414150	Tigerclaw says, I remember the first time I saw Aliens Arcade, it was at the Dade County Youth Fair.
4414150	4421316	There was this trend, I think, where they had an arcade and I saw a tent where they had an arcade and I saw this game for the first time.
4421316	4425800	The funny thing about the Aliens Arcade, even though it's based on the movie, it had a lot of things that weren't in the movie.
4425800	4429943	Well, I mean, the Simpsons arcade game wasn't really based on an episode of Simpsons.
4429943	4430344	It happens.
4430344	4430884	It happens.
4430884	4434607	There actually were things that were in this game
4436497	4445690	There's a channel I like called Alien Theory that went over how some concepts in this were actually cut from the script from the original shooting.
4445690	4452740	So they did have a little bit more to go with like things that showed up in the novelization that didn't show up in the movie.
4452740	4453201	Oh, interesting.
4453870	4463135	Now, yeah, you know, it's it's interesting, because when I think about the old school alien stuff in video games, my brain goes to and I'm almost positive you've covered this as a classic game of the week in the past.
4463135	4478825	But the old Sega classic Alien Syndrome, which I feel like even though maybe that game didn't have the license, I feel like it was inspired in part still by the franchise, which is I feel like there's still like, I feel like if the movie didn't exist, that game wouldn't exist.
4478825	4479225	You know what I mean?
4480865	4484086	Yeah, um, I don't know, maybe.
4484086	4484967	Yeah, just a random thought.
4484967	4496431	But, um, but I mean, keep in mind that when Alien came out, though, it came out what?
4496431	4503894	And it had been in concept since 75, I want to say.
4503894	4508255	And I mean, the concept for Alien predated Star Wars.
4508255	4509636	Predated the concept for Star Wars.
4511089	4529817	And so if you think about it, we might not have had that, you know, we might be missing an entire genre of games from that initial movie because who thought to do a scary movie out in space?
4529817	4532058	So anyway.
4532058	4532899	All right.
4532899	4533459	Well, there it is.
4533459	4535400	Your classic game of the week.
4535400	4536220	Not too surprising.
4536220	4538601	In space, no one can hear you scream because there's no atmosphere.
4539109	4545792	Not too surprising if you've been following what DarkSakura has been kind of, I don't want to say obsessed with, but all about lately.
4545792	4548934	No, you can say I'm obsessed with it because I do that.
4548934	4552036	I get obsessed about certain things and then I move on.
4552036	4553376	All right.
4553376	4553717	All right.
4553717	4560260	Well, let's move on to our rapid fire news where we're going to travel around the world and check out some other headlines pretty quickly.
4560260	4562201	Loki, what's what you got for us?
4563406	4573589	Well, as Jason alluded to in the intro, LEGO has confirmed that LEGO Animal Crossing is going to be a thing that's happening.
4573589	4584852	It had leaked out a while ago that there were going to be multiple different sets coming out between $15 and $75 in March of next year.
4584852	4589313	And they didn't really necessarily say when these are going to be coming out, I don't believe.
4590001	4602417	But they did basically have, you know, they did confirm, you know, with a trailer, cute little minifigs, that it is going to be a thing that's happening.
4602417	4602777	Dang it.
4602777	4606061	I'm going to have to get some of these probably.
4608269	4610151	So that is cute.
4610151	4612053	It is very, very cute.
4612053	4613414	So I love that.
4613414	4617177	It's one of those things I didn't even think that they would think of.
4617177	4620700	And then when they thought of it, I'm like, oh, shit, that's good.
4620700	4622042	That's good.
4622042	4622522	Good shot.
4622522	4623163	Well played.
4623163	4624784	Check and mate.
4624784	4625225	Yeah.
4625225	4630009	So my God, I need the Marshall and the Rosie.
4630009	4630329	Oh, my God.
4630329	4630569	Yeah.
4632228	4634150	So yeah, it'll be interesting to see what they do with that.
4634150	4643920	I wonder if they're going to have blind bags for some of the characters, because that's a thing that they have done within the Mario sets, so I could see them doing that.
4643920	4648985	And this is also something that I've been saying that they should be doing with these different... Sony, actually.
4648985	4652388	Something I've been saying that Sony should do, and I think this should be a thing on the...
4653189	4654049	On Steam and stuff.
4654049	4659632	So Sony is now adding free movies to their expensive version of PlayStation Plus.
4659632	4671617	So PlayStation Plus Premium and Deluxe members are going to get a Sony Pictures Core, which allows early access to certain films like Gran Turismo, for example.
4673158	4685585	This is a rebrand of their streaming service, BraviaCore, and they have allows users to purchase and rent up to 2000 Sony films straight from your console.
4685585	4695050	I hope that they're including these and not just like making you purchase them as well, but you just generally access first first to buy at maximum price before they go on sale.
4696826	4723418	so we'll see like if they are adding some movies it does say for free so there are things that are going to be in there um i'd be curious to see what that lineup looks like but i always thought it would be a good idea with you know to help incentivize i would think even some of the lower tiers and stuff but i think honestly i think that they should be selling movies like on steam and stuff like i i would see
4724596	4741187	you know offering like can you imagine like old retro movies and stuff like that doing like humble bundles of that kind of stuff like oh hey classic 50s sci-fi films you know just for the Halloween and that type of stuff like if I collect collect because I don't play a lot of
4741973	4744934	Like games that way, so why not?
4744934	4748255	You know, they do it already with ebooks and stuff, so why not?
4748255	4751256	I think you can make some pretty good money off of that.
4751256	4753377	And I think this is a cool feature.
4753377	4756858	Will this get me to do PlayStation Plus?
4756858	4759019	Nope!
4759019	4760500	Sorry.
4760500	4762540	It's gonna need more than that.
4762540	4764361	Also, I don't have a PlayStation 5.
4764361	4767502	Also, I would still not pay for that tier.
4768935	4770798	I'm looking in chat here.
4770798	4773781	Fifth Dream says, I have a few movies from Humble.
4773781	4775563	Dark Tattooist says, Loki has a great idea.
4775563	4777425	You just know they'll never do it, though.
4777425	4780488	And Mike Deaf says, I'm surprised they didn't offer this from the beginning, being honest.
4780488	4789057	Yeah, I know I've brought this up before, is why doesn't Sony leverage their other arms that they have to make a more attractive competitor to Game Pass?
4789678	4797301	Because maybe because the way they have their their company split up, like the different divisions aren't necessarily kind of pulling money together.
4797301	4803663	So, you know, you may have one doing well, like, but that may end up as a loss in another one or something like that.
4803663	4805343	And so maybe that's why they're not doing it.
4805343	4807684	But it doesn't seem smart to me.
4807684	4812766	Sony Music is another option, like they should be doing some streaming music stuff with that as well.
4812766	4815927	I think just leverage what you got.
4815927	4816087	Yeah.
4817418	4823207	Alright, well let's travel on and check out some more Rapid Fire news.
4823207	4823948	Let's go to DarkSakura.
4825796	4833162	So, um, with, uh, more of the Atari stuff going around, there is a, an updated Berserk.
4833162	4834863	It's Berserk Recharged.
4834863	4841588	It's been announced for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch PC, Xbox Series.
4841588	4846592	Um, and basically it's, uh, you know, Evil Otto is back!
4846592	4847813	Big ol' grinny face!
4847813	4849674	I love Berserk so much.
4849674	4851976	Yeah, the evil little happy face.
4851976	4852396	I love that.
4853328	4857329	You have a high score mode for arcade.
4857329	4861711	You can do different challenges to shoot and dodge.
4861711	4864312	You can also play with friends.
4864312	4870534	And the soundtrack is very 80s themed, of course.
4870534	4875716	So, of course, there's all these power-ups and local competitive and leaderboards and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4875716	4879097	So, hey, get creeped out by a giant smiley face.
4879097	4879597	It's Berserk.
4881436	4905837	all right uh and then one more kind of announcement of a new game that we got this week uh this is a game um and oops sorry some of the audio is coming through as i'm playing the trailer here live uh but we uh got an announcement for a follow-up to the game time spinner you remember that game uh time spinner is a really good metroidvania that came out uh we actually had the creator on olr a long time ago i don't know if you know
4906497	4907398	TimeSpinner 2 Unwoven Dream
4931253	4932994	And it looks obviously very smooth there.
4932994	4937175	It's set after the events of the first game, you see some familiar faces and so forth.
4937175	4947579	And you know, if you enjoyed the Symphony of the Night goodness that this game brought to the table, you're going to get even more good stuff with Time Spinner 2.
4947579	4949380	Check that out.
4949380	4949700	Very cool.
4950188	4960973	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that are coming out a little sooner to a console or retail platform wherever near you.

5082285	5086447	Alright, well let's take a look at Japan and what's coming out in Japan this week.
5086447	5092450	On the Nintendo Switch, we have Tin Hearts is releasing, as well as River City Rival Showdown.
5092450	5097153	And yes, that is another kind of dating all the way back to the Kunio-kun games.
5097153	5100795	And it kind of looks being called like a Nekketsu, you know,
5101635	5102696	Downtown something.
5121407	5122507	Like, it looks kind of neat.
5122507	5124868	Like, I have to say, I kind of love it.
5124868	5126968	I don't know why it gives me like a Scott Pilgrim vibe.
5126968	5127909	Is that weird?
5127909	5128709	I don't know.
5128709	5131049	But it looks fun.
5131049	5132510	Like, I'd have to check that out.
5132510	5133150	Who knows?
5133150	5137591	So anyway, that is coming out in Japan.
5137591	5140152	Also, we have coming out in Japan this week.
5142353	5144354	close the window, where are we going?
5144354	5150458	Hello, Rear Sakai is also out on the Nintendo Switch this week in Japan.
5150458	5162286	Let's take a quick look and go over to the PlayStation 5 in Japan, where we have the Caligula Effect 2 is coming out in Japan as well as Caligula Overdose.
5163081	5167043	All the Caligula, if you want that, is out this week in Japan.
5167043	5180147	Tin Hearts is also releasing on the PlayStation 5 this week, and Warhammer 40,000 Inquisitor Martyr is also out this week in Japan.
5180147	5180888	That's it for Japan.
5180888	5181968	Let's go to Europe, DarkSakura.
5183303	5187167	So, the MetaQuest 3 is on the 10th of October.
5187167	5196955	Moving also on the 10th of October, we have Wild Card Football for PlayStation and Xbox, Survivor Castaway Camp for PlayStation and Switch.

5225550	5228271	For Switch, Absolute Drift.
5228271	5237294	It's funny, when I first glanced at the picture, even though it's supposed to be like an 8-6, it looked like a water faucet, like, for a second.
5237914	5243018	Anyway, on the 3 as well, Fortnite Transformers pack.
5243018	5247641	Remember, Fortnite sucks now because of Shell, thank you.
5247641	5259029	Transformers Earthspark Expedition on the 3 again, on PlayStation and Xbox, Lords of the Fallen, and that is it for that week.
5259029	5263012	There's more stuff after that, including some Sonic.
5263012	5263372	Sanic!
5265440	5267621	All right, we have a few more headlines for you.
5267621	5272923	And then we're gonna open up the phone lines if any of you want to call us over at VOG at network.com slash discord.
5272923	5276865	I know we have some emails tonight because we got at least two from the same person.
5276865	5278346	So we're gonna get to that later too.
5278346	5280246	But first, we have some more headlines.
5280246	5281947	I need to step away for just a moment.
5281947	5282327	Sorry.
5282327	5283788	So Loki, you want to take it away?
5285642	5288805	Yep, it feels like we're in Bizarro World because what?
5288805	5292209	Some accountability actually happening here?
5292209	5302940	Apparently the French authorities are moving ahead with a criminal investigation regarding the sexual misconduct allegations coming from inside Ubisoft.
5302940	5307025	Five former executives were detained for questioning.
5307905	5319530	including VP Tommy Francois and CEO Yves Gaumont's former right hand, creative Serge... I don't know how to pronounce his last name.
5319530	5322732	I'm going to say Hascote.
5322732	5326533	They're apparently been... It's just part of this investigation.
5326533	5329735	It's more of just, you know, for questioning right now.
5329735	5332596	Could it be that they're moving in on Yves Gaumont?
5332596	5334877	And so now they're getting the people around him, you know, try to
5335673	5336854	Thank you for watching!
5351404	5371628	because you know for a long time it was a bit like three years now um since the allegations came out originally so i'm quite surprised um along with that it says as part of the detentions the former executives will they'll give testimony and that can be used in eventual uh criminal trial also um
5373004	5387668	They're apparently the high profile action that's being taken regarding allegations first came late in 2020 during a multi-year investigation involving interviews with over 50 current and former employees.
5387668	5394070	I'm curious to see who the other three executives were, because they only mentioned two of them.
5394070	5396211	Nail them to the wall.
5396211	5398312	Nail all of them to the wall, especially.
5400220	5404362	put them on display, make an example of them.
5404362	5408725	So, uh, yeah, I'm curious to see what happens with this.
5408725	5411586	Hopefully something comes of this.
5411586	5414648	But right now, I don't know.
5414648	5420191	Mike Defton over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, Wow, people getting accountable for their actions.
5420191	5421092	A total surprise.
5421092	5424073	Not going to lie.
5424073	5425354	I want I want
5426449	5428671	them to publicly suffer.
5428671	5435096	I mean, I we need more examples made of people so they can see they cannot get away with it.
5435096	5437718	I was gonna say we're not quite at full accountability yet.
5437718	5441360	We're like, but but it's like, ooh, we're actually seeing that that's a possibility.
5441360	5445844	And that's exciting, because we're so used to just no accountability ever happening.
5445844	5453229	So it's, it's, well, I don't know, I feel weird celebrating it, because like, we shouldn't have to be doing this in the first place.
5453229	5453609	But it is
5454802	5462266	is nice to see that at least in some places people are held accountable.
5462266	5472591	SGO 100 Matt with a fair statement saying I hope this provides relief for the people they abused slash enabled their abusers.
5472591	5474712	All right, moving on DarkSakura.
5476672	5485286	So the studio behind Just Cause, that's Avalanche Studios Group, are having a union.
5485286	5487590	About 100 employees are unionizing.
5487590	5489433	That's basically a fifth of the company.
5490295	5496959	and they are now in bargaining position for fair wages and respect.
5496959	5504923	They have joined Unionen, which is a Swedish trade union, and they're hoping to grow.
5504923	5509445	They have some issues to go over, but wouldn't share specifically which one.
5509445	5512967	So I'll go ahead and read the statement from Avalanche.
5513687	5519593	As an employer, we're committed to creating the best possible conditions for all avalanchers to thrive.
5519593	5522315	We support and welcome any initiative that goes in that direction.
5522315	5528501	This also means that we listen, invite dialogue, and encourage to bring people forward their perspectives and needs.
5529302	5535670	After all, it's thanks to each and every avalanche that we're able to make the great games we're known for.
5535670	5543399	Even though this is coming after a very public dispute between the companies and their HR department's lack of communication.
5543399	5548345	So it looks like I think they see their back to the wall.
5548345	5548705	All right.
5549817	5550538	We Need More Unions!
5565497	5574389	Yeah, apparently the developers of the wonderful dating sim Hatovo Boyfriend were not paid.
5574389	5580938	They were missing some payments from Epic during their layoffs at Mediatonic and
5583000	5589565	Because of that, now they've been reaching out to Epic to figure out what's going on with the payments.
5589565	5591187	Moa is not happy.
5591187	5592288	Yeah, Moa is not happy.
5592288	5600634	He says, by the way, I've got no royalty payment for Hot Tofu Boyfriend from Epic since they acquired Mediatonic back in spring of 2021.
5600634	5603856	I don't think the sales have been zero for two years.
5603856	5607759	And they say, we're looking into this and the team will be reaching out to you directly.
5611920	5620346	It just goes to show you like, like, even the Epic Marketplace, as we talked about last week, is very bare bones for what it is.
5620346	5622267	How many years has it been up already?
5622267	5625669	Like quite three years, I think, at least.
5625669	5631654	And, and I mean, this is how they're still treating partnerships with people that are on your platform.
5631654	5635556	Like, I'm sure Fortnite's not missing any payments.
5635556	5636437	Like, that's ridiculous.
5636437	5637738	You got to treat people
5639809	5643832	I was going to say, but Bobby already said that the game isn't on the Epic Store.
5643832	5645774	It's just published by Epic.
5645774	5648817	Oh, understandable.
5648817	5658286	But I will say one thing, at least in terms of Mac OS, is that it hasn't been given 64-bit support.
5658286	5662669	I've had to play the iPad version on my M1.
5662669	5664952	So, just saying.
5664952	5665392	Interesting.
5666578	5668319	Yeah, still the best.
5668319	5672000	How does something go so long without getting payment or royalties?
5672000	5675841	It's so, I mean, it's one of those things that just kind of blows my mind.
5675841	5676901	Like, how does this happen?
5676901	5681423	But then, you know, you realize how shitty a lot of things are, and you go, of course, this is what happens.
5681423	5684604	It's just, it's so wild to me.
5684604	5685184	It's weird.
5685184	5688185	It's not like Moa has been quiet about everything.
5688185	5691386	I mean, she's a fairly consistent poster.
5693326	5700890	Um, Bobby with a theory here in chat saying Epic took over the publishing rights when they bought Mediatonic and probably forgot about How to Fool Boyfriend.
5700890	5703151	They didn't forget to pull it from other platforms.
5703151	5708073	I'm wondering if Epic also meant to pull it from Steam and forgot for two years.
5708073	5713076	Honestly, still on it's still on the app store if I recall correctly.
5713565	5718746	No, it says they removed it from iOS and Android and PlayStation stores.
5718746	5719806	It's still in my purchase history.
5719806	5722607	Never mind, because I can always redownload it out of my purchase history.
5722607	5723467	So it's not gone.
5723467	5725567	Yeah, yeah.
5725567	5728188	Once you once you have once you've grabbed it, you can get it again.
5728188	5731128	So it's not until it's completely removed.
5731128	5733448	So.
5733448	5738849	As 200 Matt says, companies get so big, they forget basic stuff like paying their partners.
5738849	5741110	My goodness.
5741110	5742690	If only there was some accountability there.
5743424	5745251	You know what they didn't forget though?
5745251	5746916	Making a partnership with Shell!
5746916	5747539	Yeah!
5749008	5756750	Anyway, let me try to move on to something that, I don't know, I think most of the folks here at Orange Lantern Radio will find this very interesting.
5756750	5765052	It is what we kind of get for DDR's 25th anniversary, you know, which we were talking a lot on the show about last week.
5765052	5775775	Well, apparently, Zuiki, I hope I said this right, Zuikai maybe, I don't know, a company over in Japan just announced a playable mini arcade version of
5776435	5781432	Dance Dance Revolution and it is actually you had it right the first time it is supported
5782473	5783573	by Konami.
5783573	5785514	It will have the fully playable game.
5785514	5789975	So this is different even though yes, there is a mini arcade of DDR out there now.
5789975	5793176	This is going to be a fully playable DDR game.
5793176	5798998	It is not just going to be like three MIDI versions of the song or whatever.
5798998	5805139	This is going to actually be a fully playable and it's it's I guess the ROMs that were in the arcade.
5805139	5806860	I mean, you can play them in MAME now if you
5807660	5810803	Not necessarily because it doesn't have any of the licensed music.
5810803	5812744	It's only the Konami originals.
5812744	5813525	Oh, OK.
5813525	5815626	OK, I know that.
5815626	5817247	Yeah, it's one fifth scale.
5817247	5818248	Oh, God.
5818248	5821390	Third Mix is going to be gutted if it doesn't have any of the licenses.
5821390	5823932	Yeah, they have the song list actually out there.
5823932	5826654	So it I have a search through my Twitter.
5826654	5829056	How long to hack?
5829056	5831898	Yeah, how long to hack to get the full versions back in?
5831898	5835320	I hear I know someone on Twitter that will probably be able to do that.
5835320	5836761	The guy that does all those.
5837584	5838787	Um, the
5840622	5869845	all the different music game stuff and arcade stuff he's been hacking so now this mini is going to be and i'm gonna guess this is what loki referred to earlier it is a crowd funded uh so there's a crowdfunding campaign that launched uh i'm sorry is going to be launching uh soon this week actually on kibidango a japanese version of kickstarter that's k-i-b-i-d-a-n-g-o dot com we don't know what the price is we don't know what you get for backing it or anything like that so uh we'll have that information though
5870165	5876491	probably by the time many of you listen to this show because 7pm JST on October the 10th.
5876491	5882957	So probably at some point during the day tomorrow, we'll find out more about that could be interesting.
5882957	5884819	I'm logging into Kibidango.
5886355	5889798	I like how they have like you can you can replace the marquees on them.
5889798	5891719	They had the little side art as well.
5891719	5895862	It goes beside the actual monitors.
5895862	5897443	Oh, God, there was a song list.
5897443	5901906	So I saw the song list and it was all the like Konami original stuff.
5901906	5909472	I mean, it does make sense that like the licenses are probably long expired, especially because some of those licenses are now in another dance game.
5909472	5910833	You think about it.
5910833	5912534	So it's interesting.
5912534	5912774	Yeah.
5914875	5919819	As Joe and Hunter Matt does say, backing this might be the only way to beat the scalpers and bots to getting this.
5919819	5921120	Ain't that the truth?
5921120	5924323	DarkSakura says also it works with a full size Konami pad.
5924323	5924884	That's why.
5924884	5928727	But how would you how would you see the damn screen?
5928727	5932410	It exports out via HDMI, so you can put it on your TV.
5932410	5933691	Oh, nice.
5933691	5934211	That's fun.
5934211	5936453	Yes.
5936453	5941017	And plus, you can also apparently use the little finger dance pads with their PC game as well.
5941017	5942598	Oh, well, that's a throwback.
5943322	5945144	That's cool.
5945144	5949787	Yeah, it's where is that stupid list?
5949787	5951108	Because they had them all.
5951108	5953350	It was listed.
5953350	5954091	Maybe it's on here.
5954423	5954923	Well, that's fine.
5954923	5960246	While you look it up, I'm going to go to the mailbag because I believe we have some emails about DDR tonight.
5960246	5963208	So every week we invite your emails.
5963208	5966689	Participate at I had to think about what the email address even was for a minute.
5966689	5977575	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us and DarkSakura will put on the hazmat suit and dive into the mailbag and dig out your yucky stinky emails and read them here on air.
5980140	5982461	Make It Better, Trip Machine, Paranoia
6002474	6020212	Second mix we have Make It Better So Real Mix, Keep On Moving, Put Your Faith In Me, Brilliant To You, Put Your Faith In Me Jazzy Groove, Brilliant To You Orchestra Groove, AM3P, SP Trip Machine Jungle Mix, Paranoia Max Dirty Mix, and Paranoia KCET Clean Mix.
6020212	6025136	And then last but not least, third mix we have Afronova, Dead End, La Senorita,
6025917	6035341	SilentHill, PerinoRebirth, and GradiusSickCyberAMDG5Mix.
6035341	6037542	All right, cool.
6037542	6037782	All right.
6037782	6038862	Sounds pretty solid.
6038862	6040903	Of course, they have the best song, so I'm happy.
6040903	6042264	Yeah.
6042264	6045345	All right, let's go to the emails.
6045345	6045465	Yep.
6045760	6047221	First email.
6047221	6050062	My first one comes from Garth Wolf.
6050062	6051682	I'm loading it up.
6051682	6057265	Dear OLR, Honestly, I'm elated to hear that Jim Ryan is departing PlayStation.
6057265	6058985	Actually, I have to read the title first.
6058985	6061266	Not completely Kylie this time, but do you believe in magic?
6061266	6063047	Alright, now I'll continue with the nail.
6063758	6069761	For a while now, don't you feel like Sony has been lacking that magic that comes with having a real champion of the brand?
6069761	6076325	Jim never had a stage presence or put himself out there like Jack Trenton, loved him, or Shawn Layden.
6076325	6084769	And on top of that, Jim has had some fumbles like that international email where he was clearly dismissive of women's reproductive rights.
6084769	6087731	What kind of leader would help Sony out?
6087731	6088491	Huh?
6088491	6089212	I forgot about that.
6089212	6089712	That's all I said.
6089712	6091373	I forgot that that was the thing.
6091373	6091453	Oh.
6092462	6094764	What kind of leader would help Sony out?
6094764	6101809	Do you prefer that it remain relatively faceless in leadership like the approach Jim had taken in the past few years?
6101809	6105331	Or do we need someone energetic like a Reggie to take the reins?
6105331	6107873	That's all and hold on to now, Garth Wolf.
6108920	6112663	Kylie Minogue should be the spokesperson for the Sony PlayStation, quite frankly.
6112663	6113984	Actually, and you know what?
6113984	6119888	You think I joke, but at the same time, do you all remember when T-Mobile first came out?
6119888	6122130	When it was first, it was brand new.
6122130	6125212	They had Catherine Zeta-Jones as their spokesperson.
6125212	6131096	And talk about one of the most infamous spokespeople that was so good for the brand back in the day.
6131096	6132137	Oh, no.
6132137	6132497	Oh, no.
6132497	6133258	You know who they need?
6133258	6133858	Who?
6133858	6135940	Don French as Catherine Zeta-Jones.
6138518	6148506	But anyway, uh, or just get, you know, Jennifer Saunders and all them to, to be the Sony PlayStation people.
6148506	6149167	No.
6149167	6159415	Uh, I, I think, yeah, I think there's a lot more fun to be had with a face, you know, and the industry kind of hasn't had one for a minute, you know, Major Nelson retired.
6159415	6161037	Uh, Phil Spencer is pretty good.
6161037	6163759	You know, he's, he goes on podcasts and does a lot of interviews.
6163759	6164960	He's a pretty good face, you know,
6165120	6165560	Reggie was A+.
6179321	6191849	if I were to bring up somebody like Phil Spencer is somebody who understands the games industry, somebody who is a gamer, somebody who enjoys games, somebody who, you know, understands the good parts about video games.
6191849	6195571	For me, that's more important than any charisma.
6195571	6200354	The person can be an introvert as long as they understand this industry.
6200354	6203796	So that's that's my bigger concern.
6203796	6204876	Oh, my God.
6204876	6207058	We needed the monsoon as a spokesperson.
6209734	6210775	That's it.
6210775	6211475	Anyway.
6211475	6213197	Anyway.
6213197	6222104	So the next email, as soon as it decides to load for me, because our mail server thing is quite slow.
6222104	6225747	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
6225747	6226668	There you go.
6226668	6227188	Hello, LLR.
6227872	6242201	It was really cool to hear the opening segment on last week's show about the 25th anniversary of Dance Dance Revolution, and it's always great to hear the three of you reminiscing about it, but unfortunately, I'm sorry to report that in this country, the game has suffered a major setback as of late.
6242201	6253848	You may recall that back in 2016, Round One USA, which at the time had just a handful of locations, mostly in California, partnered with Dave & Buster's to buy brand new DDR machines and spread them across the country.
6255070	6263717	This led to the North American release of Dance Dance Revolution A, as well as the launch of official e-amusement service to go with it.
6263717	6274466	When Japan got the new content, so did we on the same day when the sequels DDR A20, or A20, sorry, and A20 Plus launched, we got those too.
6274466	6278810	The DDR community gathered around and then grew rapidly.
6278810	6282793	For most of the past seven years, we've been enjoying the current versions of DDR
6283193	6287695	at all of these locations until now.
6287695	6303981	The latest version, DDRe3, launched in Japan in early 2022, first in the exclusive gold 20th anniversary model, followed by the launch on older cabinets last June, but none of these machines in the USA received the upgrade.
6303981	6308183	After over a year of waiting, we finally found out why Dave and Busters did not want to pay for the upgrade.
6308683	6317952	Part of the problem may have been that Konami has been wanting to switch to the same sort of revenue sharing business model that they have been using in Japan for many years.
6317952	6322997	Dave and Buster's vastly prefers the traditional American model of buying the game outright.
6322997	6326600	The two companies did not see eye to eye, and in the end, Dave and Buster's opted out.
6327281	6335649	As a result, all Round 1 locations now have upgraded all their DDR machines to the latest version, reportedly converting them to a revenue-sharing model.
6335649	6342314	All of the DDR machines at DMB have been left behind on the previous version, which is now 18 months out of date.
6342314	6349541	The version is already missing about 150 new songs that are now available in the current version, with more coming every month.
6350121	6357464	And while these outdated machines are currently still connected to the E-Amusement Network, it is only a matter of time until Konami discontinues the network support.
6357464	6364767	They've already kept the network up for longer than they ever have for a discontinued version of DDR, so they could drop it at any time.
6365627	6369471	If and when Konami shuts the network off, players will no longer be able to log in.
6369471	6384725	Obviously, this means no more score saving, rival features, and the loss of several modifiers, but also players will lose access to over 100 songs, including the 90 unlockable ones, as well as any songs that have only challenge level charts.
6386667	6397010	It essentially makes this version of the game even more outdated than it already was, and even if the network is not shut off, D&B players are still missing all the game's new content, events, and tournaments.
6397010	6402011	This is a big blow to the community, especially for anyone who has local D&B, but not a Round 1.
6402011	6408553	For me personally, it means I have to drive an hour each way in order to play, rather than 15 minutes.
6408553	6414995	A new Round 1 is supposed to open next year, but that's only half an hour away from me, but that's still twice as far.
6414995	6415555	Yeah, this sucks.
6416155	6422963	There's still a chance that the American DDR community could continue to grow, but this definitely shrinks the chance of that happening.
6422963	6423884	Sigh.
6423884	6425987	Anyway, thank you as always for the show.
6425987	6427368	Sorry to be a downer.
6427368	6429931	I promise my next email will have better news.
6429931	6430652	Enjoy your week.
6430652	6431874	Erin YYR.
6431874	6432935	There is a follow up email.
6433115	6436358	Actually, before you get to that, can I just quickly respond to some something in this email?
6436358	6444765	Because that is interesting perspective, because let me put something in perspective for you is that in Northern California, let's see, there's round one in.
6444765	6451130	So in Northern California, there's a round one in Roseville, Hayward, Concord, San Jose and soon to be San Francisco near the university.
6451130	6455214	So there's five and it might even be a sixth one, but there's there's five round ones.
6455214	6458276	And in that same area, there's two Dave and Buster's.
6458276	6459057	We're getting a third one.
6459886	6461688	We're building a DMV in Palladio.
6461688	6464490	Is it going to be bigger than the one in Roseville?
6464490	6467393	I think they're building it on the back side of that stupid... It's the aquarium over there.
6467393	6468474	Toby Keith bar is something else now.
6484209	6491072	But my point, okay, even if they open a third DMV in Folsom, that's still five one round round ones to three DMVs.
6491072	6504438	So it's that that's why this I completely missed the memo is because from my perspective and and remember the closest DMV I keep slamming and say is bad because it's just it's not a good DMV.
6504438	6505178	I like DMV.
6505178	6505958	I like the big ones.
6505958	6507139	I like the one in San Jose.
6507139	6507999	I don't like the one in Rosemont.
6507999	6508779	That one's nice.
6508779	6509120	Yeah.
6509120	6509340	Yeah.
6510180	6510762	No, exactly.
6510762	6512967	What we went to was the one in Irvine or whatever.
6512967	6514952	That was like a really nice DMV.
6514952	6515593	Like that one.
6515593	6517578	I haven't been to San Jose, but I hear it's nice.
6517578	6518821	But like the one in Roseville is just like...
6519559	6520700	Is this it?
6520700	6521220	It's like diet.
6521220	6521901	It's a closet.
6521901	6523322	I can't believe it's not DMV.
6523322	6530848	Anyway, my point is, that's how you can see our perspective is skewed because you mentioned that, you know, you have double the commute if you want to find around one.
6530848	6542577	So I get it from your perspective, but to be honest, for the DDR, and this might sound fucked up, and I'm sorry, but for the DDR scene in Northern California, everything we said last week still holds.
6543620	6549764	But that does suck like and thank you for giving me the perspective from somewhere else because it you're right.
6549764	6554207	I mean, of course Konami is going to pull the plug on that someday and it is about money.
6554207	6564193	And those reasons that you're calling out are probably spot on as to why Dave and Busters isn't playing and why Konami is going to pull the plug on them in the next year that that will happen the way you phrase that.
6564193	6564773	Absolutely.
6564773	6566054	And that does suck.
6566054	6567355	Um, you
6569050	6570172	Do I want to go here?
6570172	6571493	Yes, of course I want to go here.
6571493	6579524	You wonder why pirate networks to Konami's EMUs network are flourishing.
6579524	6581146	That's all I got to say about that.
6581146	6581847	Yes, I'm sorry.
6581847	6582407	Go ahead, DarkSakura.
6582407	6583469	There's more in the next email.
6583469	6583889	Yes, yes.
6584785	6586366	Sorry, I lied.
6586366	6589728	I listened a little bit further into this show and I need to chime in again.
6589728	6604836	I can't speak for the entire country, but I can speak for the New York metropolitan area, and I can tell you that according to the most popular current arcade database, as well as my personal experience and knowledge, as of about two years ago, there are no longer any older public DDR machines that are in good condition.
6604836	6605536	Zero.
6605536	6608378	By older, I mean all of the ex-Supernova and earlier cabinets.
6609208	6614052	All of the ones around here either got bought by private collectors or left the area.
6614052	6619336	There are a few extremes and supernovas in the wild, but most are in awful shape, not worth making a drive.
6619336	6626461	If you're looking to play the older versions at this point, unless you want your own machine, the best option is, and I'm not even joking, MAME.
6626461	6629444	MAME now runs the early Bimani games perfectly.
6629444	6636249	With a good USB stage, you're going to get an experience that will match or beat anything you can find in the public in 2023.
6637950	6640031	Once again, have a great week and thanks for the show.
6640031	6640671	See y'all later.
6640671	6642192	Aaron YYR.
6642192	6646053	What's a great place to find Mameroms in 2023?
6646053	6650035	Asking for a friend.
6650035	6651575	I think they're pretty easy just to find.
6651575	6653916	I think you just do a Google search and you'll be able to find them.
6653916	6654897	I guess.
6654897	6663560	We probably shouldn't say them on air, but we do have a Discord server and there's places you can slide in my DMs.
6663560	6665921	Well, to that, there's probably Discord servers
6666777	6668257	dedicated to that type of stuff nowadays.
6668257	6670318	Ah, you're probably right, you're probably right.
6670318	6680181	There used to be specific Bomani Tournament sites too, but like, I haven't been able to, I haven't been on there in a long time.
6680181	6692885	But yeah, I mean, there's things around, for certain, there's a lot of different like, arcades, and I'm sure that like, you know, DDR Ace 3 or A3 or whatever it's called,
6693676	6695958	Let's run on PC anyways.
6695958	6707928	Like a lot of that stuff you can just literally download the PC executable that's been patched by somebody and then you can just run the same software on an existing cabinet or if you have a modded cabinet or something like that.
6708388	6730253	I had a Stepmania setup but my computer died probably because it's in the garage and that cycles between really cold and really hot all the time and so it's just gonna kill a PC eventually but thankfully the System 573 board is still rocking, you know, so far but if I was gonna do it again I'd probably
6730982	6739953	I try to get MAME in there to emulate the older stuff, at least for the arcade versions, and maybe do a little bit of Step Maniac.
6739953	6748104	As much as I love supporting Dance Maniacs, or Step Maniacs,
6750396	6755102	I still wish there was like an emulated version of that too, because there's a lot of really cool songs on it.
6755102	6763971	Even if it was something like you got to pay for it and play it on PC, but you could use your existing hardware to run it, I'd be down.
6763971	6765633	You know what I feel tempted to do?
6765633	6766274	What's that?
6767286	6770812	Mod My Dreamcast Pads and Stream Second Mix
6782542	6802014	um an anonymous chatter uh says in chat name the rom and i got you well my my friend would really love to have ddr third mix and ddr solo 2000 i think would be the two and oh and fourth plus for god's sake fourth plus i think those three would solo bass well solo 2000 has all the soul day stuff in it so
6802794	6803354	Oh, that's right.
6803354	6803975	I forgot about that.
6803975	6805995	Yeah, so that's all you need.
6805995	6816059	And you get the, you know, booty pop that Solo 2000 also had, like the, I'm alive, I'm alive, and you know, the Temple of Butt, as you used to call it, by E-Rod.
6816059	6817300	Yeah.
6817300	6818140	The Temple of Butt.
6818140	6819300	Anyway.
6819300	6820601	All right.
6820601	6821461	Let's see.
6821461	6821701	Okay.
6821701	6822822	Thank you for the emails, YYR.
6822822	6823582	I appreciate it.
6823582	6825423	And Garth Wolf, too.
6825423	6827343	Was that it?
6827343	6828584	Now, who that is?
6828584	6829964	My baby mama.
6829964	6830605	That's a real song.
6830605	6831385	My baby daddy.
6831385	6831525	Yeah.
6832647	6837108	Right now, maybe Mama was the song in DDR, but maybe Mama was the real song.
6837108	6839969	Both of them are fucked up.
6839969	6840649	No more emails.
6840649	6841830	We're good.
6841830	6843510	No, no more.
6843510	6845010	OK, that's it.
6845010	6845771	No, I said no more.
6845771	6846251	That's it.
6846251	6846531	No more.
6846531	6847011	That's it.
6847011	6848151	OK.
6848151	6851552	If you want to give us a call, vognetwork.com slash discord.
6851552	6854253	And you can also join our discord to continue the conversation throughout the week.
6855791	6859555	and find out the latest and greatest that's happening around VOG Network.
6859555	6867643	I was slacking a little bit on the YouTubes this last week because I was sick, but I'm hoping we'll get some more to you next week.
6867643	6872468	I think the latest one on the feed is still the Monster Hunter video, which I actually played a little bit of that today with some friends.
6872668	6873468	Thank you for watching!
6901724	6908294	Okay, um, Loki, I want to check in with you real quick and see if there's any last minute stories.
6908294	6911698	Uh, no, I don't think I have any.
6911698	6911999	All right.
6912888	6915249	All right, well, I guess I guess that's it.
6915249	6917129	Some weeks are long and some weeks are short.
6917129	6917509	That's all right.
6917509	6919690	We still got about two hours in.
6919690	6923971	Well, let me take a minute to thank all of you for listening to our show tonight.
6923971	6929552	Thank you for participating with Orange Lounge Radio, whether you listen live or you downloaded us on your podcast feed.
6929552	6932033	Thank you for spending some time with us here this week.
6932033	6932953	We appreciate you all.
6933273	6936494	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word.
6936494	6941676	Tell a friend or two, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices put out here on air.
6941676	6946318	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way.
6946318	6952320	And please don't forget to follow VOG Network, that's VOG Network, on our Twitch station, as well as on YouTube at VOG Network.
6954276	6955057	That's, that's it.
6955057	6956117	We're gonna get final thoughts.
6956117	6966224	And I'm going to start with DarkSakura, who I believe is moving on to the Dead by Delightening, to the Dead by Delightening for the second time in October.
6966224	6969767	I'm one follower away from hitting my year goal.
6969767	6970307	Oh, good for you.
6971275	6973236	I'm almost a thousand.
6973236	6973676	That's great.
6973676	6976597	So I would love for my dream to come true before TwitchCon.
6976597	6978238	Hint, hint, nudge, nudge, say no more.
6978238	6980679	Oh man, I wish I was going to TwitchCon.
6980679	6987222	To be fair, most of the people here probably already are, but if not... And if not, why aren't you?
6987222	6990804	I subscribe to OLR and I'm a host.
6990804	6991604	Y'all can do this.
6991604	6992384	I'm kidding.
6992384	6993265	I'm not.
6993265	6998307	No, but I'm going to play Dead by Daylight and I might see if I can... I'm working on Nurse.
6998307	6999528	Pray for me.
6999528	7000088	Well, good luck.
7001199	7003000	Thanks, and don't fuck it up.
7003000	7003680	Later, taters.
7003680	7004060	All right.
7004060	7004240	Bye.
7004240	7005341	Have a good one.
7005341	7005901	You too.
7005901	7007061	All right.
7007061	7009783	Loki, I think that we just go over to you for your final thought.
7009783	7012944	What do you want to say to our listeners tonight?
7012944	7019987	Apparently that was at Mega Bloks Xbox 360 is out today, I think, or was out soon.
7019987	7020387	Oh, yeah.
7020387	7021907	We talked about that on a prior episode.
7021907	7022948	That's that's wild.
7023390	7026032	Pre-orders, something, or maybe it was pre-orders, I don't remember.
7026032	7030096	I guess all the wires crossed.
7030096	7037162	Anyways, yeah, hopefully we'll have an episode out maybe this week, so.
7038873	7039534	Pokemon Scarlett
7055031	7057633	It kind of came and went faster than COVID would.
7057633	7060736	So yeah, that's kind of what ended up happening with me.
7060736	7062717	But I didn't do any streams last week as a result.
7062717	7066560	I didn't do anything at VOG or my personal channel just because, you know, it all piles up.
7066560	7070543	But I'll be back on track next week, just in time to then be taking the week off for TwitchCon.
7070543	7072925	But you know, it is what it is.
7072925	7075267	So we'll be back then.
7075267	7075908	But that's it.
7075908	7077849	I hope you all have a great week gaming.
7077849	7081432	We're in that time of year where there's lots of good games coming out and lots of fun things to play.
7081932	7092718	and I hope you all get a chance to play them and don't do what I do and go back to fucking bullshit like World of Warcraft and FF14 so that you never play something new.
7092718	7093638	Right, Mr. Minecraft?
7094555	7097157	Yep, I don't know what that's like at all.
7097157	7101280	I mean, hey, I'll take a break when Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out.
7101280	7104323	I probably should play Starfield, although I like to hear mixed things.
7104323	7104603	We'll see.
7104603	7105204	It's worth checking out.
7105204	7106244	It's worth checking out.
7106244	7106685	All right.
7106685	7107285	Make it a goal.
7107285	7108626	Make it a goal, everybody, to play.
7108626	7109447	Let's make it a goal.
7109447	7111268	Let's make it a pact amongst ourselves.
7111268	7113290	We're going to try to play something new this week.
7113290	7115272	We're going to try to play something new this week.
7115272	7118114	Until then, we'll see you in seven days when we do this all over again.
7118114	7120476	Thank you all so much for participating with the show tonight.
7120476	7121517	We'll see you next time.
7121517	7121757	Bye.
