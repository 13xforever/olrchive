1
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:13,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Founders are typically artists, CEOs are business people.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Founders create products, services, they fulfill needs.

3
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:18,944
[SPEAKER_00]: CEOs manipulate money, damn the consequences.

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:23,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they manipulate themselves into being a community pariah, manipulating themselves out of a role.

5
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:27,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the long tale of Unity's saga will be, but right now it doesn't involve John Riccatello.

6
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,910
[SPEAKER_00]: One CEO out, another CEO out eventually.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about their story, and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:36,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice,

9
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:42,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:47,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:57,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio back one more time with episode number 978 of our program for tonight, October the 15th of 2023.

12
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:00,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I say one more time because we're not here next week, but then we'll be back in two weeks.

13
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:09,051
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk all about that in just a moment, because this also involves not just myself, Rob Roberts, but my co-hosts, including DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

15
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:13,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you?

16
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so busy.

17
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:18,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So much going on.

18
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:28,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's only going to get busier because next week there's no Orange Launch Radio because DarkSakura and I are going to be in Vegas at TwitchCon, which is very exciting.

19
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:28,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So

20
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:36,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Dan was at Pinnagogo in Dixon all weekend.

21
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:41,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I don't like to go because I don't like where it is.

22
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And corn.

23
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:44,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what else was this weekend?

24
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:49,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this probably isn't up your alley, but it's still a pretty big deal, is the Pokemon Regional Championships.

25
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,423
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here in Sacramento, where our show is based.

26
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:53,744
[SPEAKER_03]: no idea that that was this week.

27
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:55,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I knew they were coming.

28
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:59,528
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, honestly, when they announced it, I was like, Oh, it must be a 2024 thing.

29
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:06,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I didn't realize it was like literally this weekend until I was doing Community Day for Pokemon Go at Capitol Park where I usually do.

30
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:14,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, why is there like a cluster of like seven unspun Pokestops all over by the new convention center?

31
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:14,377
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?

32
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:15,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I was and then I was like,

33
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:20,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they set up a whole little special area for the regional championships.

34
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:31,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so yeah, so I tried to get gifts out from that to some Pokemon fans that I know such as Shane, I had to text Shane and be like, you need to open your gift right now, please.

35
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:35,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Mike Deft in our chat, I know would appreciate a gift from there.

36
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:38,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of fun little virtual souvenirs.

37
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not go into

38
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,981
[SPEAKER_03]: the Pokemon regionals, but I peeked my head in the door to see what it looked like.

39
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:49,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just looked like these giant tables of nerds playing card games, which is what you'd expect.

40
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:53,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was good.

41
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:56,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been to that new convention center yet, DarkSakura?

42
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

43
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's nice.

44
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say that.

45
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:03,813
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

46
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

47
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:08,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I've been I've been very focused on other things.

48
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:09,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotcha.

49
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotcha.

50
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:16,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

51
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Loki, I think you're muted.

52
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:18,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

53
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:19,108
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

54
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:19,488
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

55
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I pushed the button.

56
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:20,989
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

57
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing all right.

58
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:27,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to figure out what this looks like a scary game playing behind you tonight that I don't recognize.

59
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like a first person.

60
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's exploring a pool.

61
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are they going to find a body?

62
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,717
[SPEAKER_03]: What game is this?

63
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:34,078
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a liminal game.

64
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:38,101
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called Dream Corps.

65
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

66
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:44,205
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's supposed to resemble like the back rooms and stuff.

67
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:46,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

68
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:47,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

69
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:52,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you can see the games that Loki's playing behind him.

70
00:03:52,092 --> 00:04:02,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific at twitch.tv slash VOG Network Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwell show again, that's VOG Network.

71
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:29,867
[SPEAKER_03]: but of course we are a podcast as well and you can listen to us anyway wherever podcasts are found such as Spotify or iTunes or well not Google Podcasts for much longer as I understand it because Google Podcasts apparently is closing up shop and or they're folding it into YouTube or something like that so there's not going to be that much longer but there's a lot of podcast apps out there and you can find us in pretty much all of them I think at this point because the one I didn't like

72
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,029
[SPEAKER_03]: shut their doors.

73
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have to worry about that anymore.

74
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:37,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to say we're not on.

75
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:38,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not a problem anymore.

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,361
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gone.

77
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, it is what it is.

78
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:42,065
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

79
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:48,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, and I just got tagged with that in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

80
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:53,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike Def talking about the regionals going I know I knew and I wished I could have gone.

81
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:57,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It was VGC trading card game and go they have all that.

82
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:04,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see Fifth Dream says they have regionals in the next town over from me, which is odd because it's such a nowhere area.

83
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,326
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm surprised every time I hear they're here.

84
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:10,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, maybe there's a lot of players in that area or just you know, wherever they can get the convention center cheap.

85
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:23,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And sjo100mat points out the Google Graveyard site continues to grow with the website killedbygoogle.com, which I'm sure probably has pages and pages to say about Google Stadia RIP.

86
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:30,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's get into the gaming news of the week starting off with our big big news.

87
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:37,147
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really a follow up story to something we've talked about every damn week on this show for the last 16 months.

88
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And this might finally be the last time we talk about it.

89
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:40,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

90
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still gonna have ramifications for weeks and weeks but big milestone this week.

91
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on?

92
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,337
[SPEAKER_01]: The Activision Blizzard deal finally

93
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,489
[SPEAKER_01]: has finished.

94
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:56,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So Microsoft has finished their acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

95
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,353
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.

96
00:05:58,353 --> 00:05:59,074
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

97
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:00,014
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the news.

98
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:00,434
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

99
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:01,375
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the news.

100
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So they closed what on Friday the 13th?

101
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that that's a, you know, on this data, you know, start your new business, but all right.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they probably had to close the deal because wasn't the federal

103
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:17,065
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

104
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:50,345
[SPEAKER_03]: One particular individual whose time I've been hoping would be running out this entire time.

105
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:51,485
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more time.

106
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:54,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what is Bobby Kotick's future in this?

107
00:06:54,586 --> 00:07:04,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby Kotick is staying on for the next two months to help aid in the transition, but then he'll be out as of January 1st.

108
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:07,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn shame it's not a swift kick in the nuts.

109
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:08,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a damn shame.

110
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a swift kick in the nuts or the butt.

111
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:11,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take either.

112
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:15,548
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's also only gonna end up with like, you know, $400 million or something.

113
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:20,275
[SPEAKER_03]: That's and that's the really depressing part is this huge golden parachute.

114
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew it was gonna happen.

115
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:22,538
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew it was gonna happen.

116
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,700
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some interesting comments on there too, but most of the comments are pretty positive about him going.

117
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

118
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:39,623
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but there's a few also saying that, like, his staying was, like, some contractual thing.

119
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:50,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but I mean, like, to keep him around for loyalty purposes, when it's his fault their stock took the drop that began the process to begin with?

120
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

121
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:52,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean,

122
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:59,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some some dump level of delusion there.

123
00:07:59,148 --> 00:07:59,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

124
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:02,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, look, I'm not pleased with the golden parachute news.

125
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I the date thing is kind of a whatever.

126
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,451
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a small price to pay to get rid of him.

127
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:06,952
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

128
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:07,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

129
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:18,417
[SPEAKER_03]: But and the date thing is, I mean, it's a it's a very clean cut off date of sorts, I'm sure for financial reasons and transition reasons, like the first of the year is a very ceremonial type of day.

130
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I get it.

131
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:21,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it soon enough?

132
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:21,318
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

133
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:31,663
[SPEAKER_03]: But now now do I now can I make one of those calendars with the little tear off pages that says days until Bobby Kotick is no longer poison in this industry?

134
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can now have that calendar.

135
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:37,546
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make a counter for it on.

136
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:42,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear Unity's looking for a new seed.

137
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:42,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

138
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:43,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

139
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:44,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

140
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:54,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, to be very honest, having him there for two more months does allow things to be transitioned cleanly.

141
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:58,416
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't really talk to each other until the deal was finalized, the quiet period.

142
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:15,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the reality of this situation, as happy as we are to see Microsoft, in the long run, see Microsoft acquire Activision Blizzard, and to be clear, and I feel like I've made this very clear in prior episodes of the show, but before somebody takes me out of context,

143
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:19,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not love the bigger fish eating the big fish.

144
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,342
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not something I love about this industry.

145
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:44,718
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular circumstance, because specifically of Bobby Kotick and the toxins that he has put in this industry, I am highly supportive of this merger because as now we see with our tearaway calendar, only what, 75 more days or whatever it is until Bobby Kotick is no longer poisoning this industry, I support this merger because the end of the day, the punchline is Bobby Kotick's out.

146
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,200
[SPEAKER_03]: The part that's going to suck about this, there's going to be redundancies.

147
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be people that end up laid off.

148
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sucks.

149
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:58,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume it's things where we talk more about publicity.

150
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:06,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's I mean, I don't know, I don't run a company, but I would I could see that there are probably going to be some some over steps there.

151
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:11,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, we already know on the Blizzard front, the eSports stuff really took a hit.

152
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:14,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, a lot of that has already been kind of on its way out.

153
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

154
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:34,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Microsoft has already, like, they had to come out the very first day to talk about Game Pass, didn't they?

155
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:38,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's the question everybody's been asking.

156
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:44,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I believe the, uh, too long didn't read of that was they're saying, don't expect anything right now.

157
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought this was interesting.

158
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:51,969
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, don't expect Call of Duty or Diablo 4 this year.

159
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:57,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And they named those two games specifically, but I thought it was interesting that they didn't name anything else.

160
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:02,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Well they probably have agreements maybe with other...

161
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:04,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Services or something.

162
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:05,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

163
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's also the newness of those games.

164
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:12,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just because there is still a transition period, you know, again, Bobby staying on till the end of the year.

165
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:21,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's probably, you know, there's probably in some ways they're still going to run like separate companies a little bit, you know, as we get closer to the end of the year, you know, and so they don't want to.

166
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:22,349
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a branding switch to happen.

167
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:22,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

168
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:27,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's they don't want to disrupt the holiday season with two of the biggest launches for Activision Blizzard this year.

169
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it all.

170
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:28,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

171
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think it would have been a little bit creepy.

172
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,310
[SPEAKER_05]: James Corden

173
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:57,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby also points out in our chat, the good Bobby, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat points out something very interesting as well saying the other interesting part is that the Activision games that are on Game Pass will not be part of the streaming.

174
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Ubisoft has the exclusive streaming rights.

175
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very interesting because, you know, as we know, they had to give those streaming rights over to Ubisoft in Europe anyway.

176
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:08,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Xcloud Streaming Rights

177
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,889
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm still curious about some of the back catalog games.

178
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:30,731
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there still is a very rich back catalog of games.

179
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:36,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 2 Remastered, Diablo 3 Ultimate Edition, some of the older Call of Duty games, Crash Bandicoot.

180
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,216
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of other games that would make sense.

181
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:43,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, there's already some good stuff on Game Pass.

182
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:52,063
[SPEAKER_03]: If you weren't already aware, because I did this, you can unlock all of the new heroes in Overwatch 2, all of them from all these passes through Game Pass.

183
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:56,145
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to do it on your Xbox version of the game.

184
00:12:56,145 --> 00:13:00,568
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you do that, it syncs up to the cloud and all that good stuff.

185
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:03,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they unlock on your PC version as well.

186
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So and I imagine you won't have to do that forever.

187
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:09,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that that will be something that probably comes together as a result of all of this.

188
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:13,775
[SPEAKER_03]: So you already can get some kind of good deal there.

189
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So interesting.

190
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby is saying it's worldwide.

191
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:24,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear the Ubisoft thing was just Europe, but maybe it has a trickle-down effect with some of the streaming deals.

192
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:35,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to look more into that, because obviously there's a lot that we're going to see settling down over the next few weeks with where does this land, but I would be surprised.

193
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:47,514
[SPEAKER_03]: if Microsoft doesn't push a few titles to Game Pass over the holiday season to really push Game Pass sales over the holiday season and entice people to keep Game Pass.

194
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:56,137
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not going to be Diablo 4, the newest Call of Duty game, but there's still a rich back catalog of other stuff they could put on there that could be very, very interesting.

195
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:59,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So we shall see what becomes of all that.

196
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:01,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned.

197
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:08,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I say even though this is like done, it's not like done, done.

198
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:13,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackelven Chat points out they'll have titles on Game Pass, but for download only.

199
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:16,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, you can still do it that way, of course.

200
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:18,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the streaming element is going to be impacted there.

201
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:21,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

202
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:26,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And Questbuster brought the receipts and shows that, yeah, they have worldwide cloud streaming rights for the next 15 years.

203
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:31,279
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I really did think that was just Europe that they gave that over, not the whole world.

204
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,019
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild.

205
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's the receipts, an article there that talks about it.

206
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:47,544
[SPEAKER_03]: For the next 15 years, Microsoft is relinquishing cloud streaming rights for all Activision games outside the European Economic Area, EEA, a region that constitutes the 27 EU members plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.

207
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:59,412
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that French game publisher Ubisoft is also a big winner, as it will have exclusive global streaming rights outside the EEA, while inside the EEA it will share streaming rights with rivals, including Microsoft Activision.

208
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:05,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a very interesting way to do it, to win over Europe, but I guess that's how they did it.

209
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

210
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:06,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Fascinating.

211
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:16,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going to be on Game Pass, maybe just not, you know, via like the X Cloud or whatever.

212
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:25,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally that, Xbox.com, which you could still do because I've done this with Overwatch 2 because of specifically what I just talked about.

213
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to do this without leaving my chair.

214
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:32,811
[SPEAKER_03]: What you can do is you can stream your Xbox Series X downstairs

215
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:38,616
[SPEAKER_03]: to your PC upstairs so you can play the game on there if you really want.

216
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:42,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I don't know why you would just want to play it on your PC, but everybody has their reasons.

217
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe DarkSakura might have a compelling reason with a Mac OS.

218
00:15:49,226 --> 00:15:56,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're not really an Xbox ecosystem person, but if you were, hypothetically, you could stream from your Xbox Series X in one room to your Mac.

219
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:59,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, so at least I think so.

220
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:01,237
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I think you can't do the website.

221
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:05,782
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got to have some type of standalone client, uh, somewhere, but I know you can do it on PC for sure.

222
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously, it's all built into Windows 11.

223
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:10,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very easy, um, to do it there.

224
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:15,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, that you can do, because I did that.

225
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

226
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:20,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, I removed parallels from my system, so that wouldn't even work for me anyway.

227
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, gotcha.

228
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:22,357
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

229
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

230
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, we'll see what continues.

231
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not taint my Mac.

232
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:28,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, stop.

233
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

234
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,313
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could if I could dual boot my current computer with Mac OS, why wouldn't I?

235
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but two are better than one.

236
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:41,738
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silicon won't support a dual boot for a different OS.

237
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:42,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

238
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:45,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's why I say if, if, if.

239
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,101
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

240
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

241
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, though, Rob,

242
00:16:50,668 --> 00:17:04,324
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what though, I mentioned it before, I was looking into all this stuff about the game porting kit and perhaps something like that would make things work.

243
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:20,285
[SPEAKER_03]: SheHulk10 says Xbox Game Pass is going to blossom, probably creating a lot of stress for people that have a huge backlog of games to play and not completed, like showing up to a smorgasbord and not hungry.

244
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:24,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I get where that comment comes from, to be fair though, Game Pass is already like that.

245
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:33,440
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, adding 20 Activision games by the end of the year, if they go that way, is only going to make the problem worse.

246
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that I will agree.

247
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:41,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I could see games I would actually like to play that I never got around to, like Crash Bandicoot Team Racing, Crash Bandicoot 4.

248
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:48,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are very likely candidates to end up in that kind of thing, that would end up this holiday season, because they're from a few years ago.

249
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:51,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's going to make that problem worse.

250
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So that part, yeah, I totally get that.

251
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:57,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But come January, I can play World of Warcraft with a clean conscience.

252
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:57,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

253
00:17:57,969 --> 00:17:58,990
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

254
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's let's move.

255
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:06,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I saw I'm playing it now, and I sort of feel that there's a lot of toxicity everywhere in the game industry.

256
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:07,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But I digress.

257
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another topic for another day.

258
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,139
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

259
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:16,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

260
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:18,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever publisher may have made the games.

261
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:19,666
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

262
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,347
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

263
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:25,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It was alright, um, I played some pinball, um...

264
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Dead by Daylight a little bit.

265
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:33,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm supposed to have Fringlish playing with me tonight.

266
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since we played together.

267
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:45,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've already beaten Live Alive, I just played some Dreamlight Valley last night, just, you know, to do stuff.

268
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:54,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And after TwitchCon, I'll be starting the SNES edition of Magic Knight Rayearth, or Super Famicom.

269
00:18:55,977 --> 00:19:00,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be fun.

270
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:08,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I played through... I played some Devil's Crush and Jackie Crush and...

271
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot how much I suck at Area 88, or as we got it, UN Squadron.

272
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Sea of Stars like Sea of Thieves?

273
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm totally not into Sea of Thieves.

274
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:20,954
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

275
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Sea of Stars is completely different.

276
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:29,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a retro-inspired RPG.

277
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:29,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

278
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:30,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what that is now.

279
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say.

280
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,942
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have time, but my retro night is actually for retro games.

281
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:49,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, games... My Retro Night is specifically RPGs that came out in Japan that did not originally come out in the US.

282
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:54,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Final Fantasy V took a long time.

283
00:19:54,796 --> 00:20:04,340
[SPEAKER_05]: It's here now, but for years and years it was- Or Seiken Densetsu 3 or Live Alive or Rayearth, Terranigma, you know.

284
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:10,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I started Star Ocean before that, but I'll go back to it a little bit later.

285
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:19,548
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of, well, I mean, I did, I did play through Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IV, but I played direct translations with the censorship removed.

286
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:20,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

287
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:25,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the kind of thing that I'm going for.

288
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:31,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I may switch to Mega Drive stuff later and do Phantasy Star 2.

289
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:35,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the original, unedited Phantasy Star 2.

290
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a few other things, who knows.

291
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:41,902
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was... Rayearth is going to be next.

292
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:49,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, I played some Cult of the Lamb to see if they did anything special.

293
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see anything yet.

294
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but that's kind of it.

295
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:58,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm still trying to find a way to play, uh, Palia.

296
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:00,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's go over to Loki then.

297
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:02,155
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

298
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:05,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I played mostly Minecraft this week as usual.

299
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've just been working on, you know,

300
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:12,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I was messing around, I guess, and gathering materials and all that stuff.

301
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:15,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I started some editing today.

302
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,820
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did actually play one other thing.

303
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:25,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So I noticed at our local department store, they had a demo for Super Mario Wonder.

304
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:30,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to play that, and it's a Mario game!

305
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:30,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

306
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:32,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

307
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:32,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty.

308
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,221
[SPEAKER_03]: That was such enthusiasm.

309
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I mean, it's it's cool.

310
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:40,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I really I like the way it looks and stuff.

311
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,967
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's like a 2D Mario game.

312
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

313
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:45,230
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like that's a good thing.

314
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Wildly different.

315
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,771
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.

316
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:47,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.

317
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:48,412
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bad thing.

318
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:49,533
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not wildly different.

319
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,596
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's neat to check it out.

320
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:52,716
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

321
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually a little bummed.

322
00:21:55,841 --> 00:22:00,706
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a lot going on for me, like for Rob Roberts Gaming Jams next week.

323
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:02,208
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot happening.

324
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm not sad.

325
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:04,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going on vacation.

326
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

327
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,392
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just the timing is very funny.

328
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:15,080
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Diablo 4 Season 2 and the huge patch that's supposed to fix a ton of quality of life stuff is on Tuesday, the day I leave.

329
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And then

330
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:24,565
[SPEAKER_03]: on the 20th is when Wonder releases, which I already have pre-ordered from the Nintendo voucher thing, so I won't be here when that releases either because I'm at TwitchCon.

331
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:32,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, hard to be upset considering the circumstances, but it's just one of those like, of course, the timing is always weird with stuff like that, so a big week for me personally.

332
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:34,610
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot to catch up on when I get back, that's for sure.

333
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:53,348
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're done with your gaming week, then I will talk about my gaming week, which honestly was probably a little less than usual because I had the double shot of the flu vaccine and the updated COVID booster on Monday and left me a little tired Monday on into Tuesday.

334
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:58,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is affected different by that stuff, and it always seems to lay me out, even though

335
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:26,304
[SPEAKER_03]: it may have I don't know it may have been the flu shot too you can't always pin this on the COVID shot because the flu shot has always done this to me too always um I got Pfizer for the very first time so I've had like four Moderna shots and one Pfizer shot so finally I'm gonna have to go get mine tomorrow yeah yeah and I'll be doing ballet oh that's gonna suck yeah so um but uh yeah so I got that so it kind of knocked me out like our the Monday playthrough I was planning with Shane on Pokemon Gen 9 like has been really

336
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:30,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with me being sick last week and then me having the side effects this week.

337
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going on vacation next week.

338
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:32,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it sucks.

339
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:37,320
[SPEAKER_03]: But that project, unfortunately, is going to have to just kind of wait until all this stuff is behind us a little bit.

340
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry to the folks that are looking forward to that.

341
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:40,545
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, you know, things happen and happens.

342
00:23:41,847 --> 00:24:10,967
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh you know i've been continuing to play the outdoor games that i have been doing such as pikmin uh monster hunter now uh i think i'm up to like level 42 or something in monster hunter now uh i did pokemon community day today uh technically i was also doing pikmin day because i wanted to do 10 000 steps and get my little badge but yeah i i thought i would catch some limited time pokemon and you know or shinies and all that stuff uh i don't remember how many shiny timbers i got i think something like 11 like it was a ridiculous amount it was it was unnecessary

343
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:33,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I did that, and then, um, as far as other games, not a lot a lot, uh, continue to do a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, mostly because my island sanctuary is the most important thing to me in that game, and I don't want to fall behind, and I want to make sure I hit max rank as well, that's also very important, so, uh, there's that, and then, um,

344
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:43,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been playing World of Warcraft Classic, which is now on the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.

345
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:50,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I started that up so I could play, you know, WoW when many would argue it was at its peak, which was during Wrath of the Lich King.

346
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:52,957
[SPEAKER_03]: They just added to the game this week, finally.

347
00:24:53,802 --> 00:25:18,919
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for group and I know it seems weird to talk about them adding things to classic but technically looking for group actually debuted during the last patch of the birding crusade so it was always in wrath of the lich king um it's just for whatever reason the classic thing they were keeping looking for group out of it for some time it was a controversial thing but they finally have decided to put that in the game and um I've been having fun with it it is definitely

348
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:46,182
[SPEAKER_03]: some things have not aged as well as others but you know you you kind of know what you're getting into when you play a classic like that for sure so um but otherwise that's that's really it i haven't been playing a lot of console stuff this week at all uh just mostly pc stuff and pretty lightly just with everything else that's been going on so um hopefully we'll get back into things next week as i mentioned a lot of stuff on the horizon for me for when i get back from twitchcom so that's that

349
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:50,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into some more gaming news.

350
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:52,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I've mentioned enough times we're not going to be here next week.

351
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:59,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I should point out Bobby Blackwolf, also on the Voice Geeks Network before us on Sunday night, also will not be here next week.

352
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:01,945
[SPEAKER_03]: He is also at TwitchCon.

353
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:09,872
[SPEAKER_03]: He is actually going to be working with Games Done Quick Express, hosting some of the runs, because you may know Bobby does some of the hosting, some of the voiceover work.

354
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:12,334
[SPEAKER_03]: for reading donations and things like that.

355
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done that for the actual week-long events over the last few seasons.

356
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:21,862
[SPEAKER_03]: But TwitchCon is actually doing like a mini-GDQ, GDQ Express.

357
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:27,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't run 24 hours, but it runs during the time that TwitchCon is running, which is still a pretty good chunk of the day.

358
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:31,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby is doing the opening hosting for Friday and Sunday.

359
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when the whole thing starts on Friday at 10am,

360
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:35,552
[SPEAKER_03]: check it out.

361
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:41,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get to hear Bobby reading some donations and everything is benefiting AbleGamers is the charity.

362
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,874
[SPEAKER_03]: The Games Done Quick Express is benefiting and that is cool.

363
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:48,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I've I have actually had my Amazon Prime on AbleGamers for quite some time.

364
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:48,935
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they call it?

365
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:49,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Smile?

366
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:53,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon, Amazon Smile has been tied to AbleGamers for quite some time.

367
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:56,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a great charity.

368
00:26:56,416 --> 00:27:00,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope GDQ does very, very well at TwitchCon.

369
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So but at some point,

370
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:07,252
[SPEAKER_03]: because this is the very first time Bobby's ever been to Vegas.

371
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:11,415
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, I'm hoping Bobby we can take him to the pinball Hall of Fame.

372
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:13,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that place is a lot of fun.

373
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:15,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And I definitely want to see his reaction to that.

374
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:20,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know my partner Alan will not be opposed to going to that because they have all the Elvira tables.

375
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,343
[SPEAKER_03]: They're his favorite.

376
00:27:21,343 --> 00:27:22,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it's just a fun place to hang out.

377
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a huge building.

378
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:26,467
[SPEAKER_03]: So excited to go check that out.

379
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:32,409
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, um, let's get on Oh, they did they shut down smile two years ago.

380
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:34,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know that.

381
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:39,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I, I've been very bad about actually going to smile dot Amazon.

382
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:40,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

383
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:42,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea they cut they shut that down.

384
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:43,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Sad.

385
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

386
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:47,715
[SPEAKER_03]: You try to do something good.

387
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:50,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it really two years ago?

388
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:51,336
[SPEAKER_03]: What is time anymore?

389
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,737
[SPEAKER_03]: My god, it feels like just last week I was on there.

390
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:55,278
[SPEAKER_03]: My god.

391
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:55,558
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

392
00:27:56,356 --> 00:28:01,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on and talk about what's going on in gaming news.

393
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will start with Loki.

394
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty big headline.

395
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:09,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, it was bound to come out at some point.

396
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:09,163
[SPEAKER_01]: This

397
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:17,410
[SPEAKER_01]: This, there is hints that who, the search of course of the Mario voice actor, who's it gonna be?

398
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:37,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So originally there was some folks that were data mining the kiosk demo for Mario Wonder and they were able to find a list of voice actors in the game and were trying to figure out based off of the voice actors that are in the code, mentioned in the code of the game

399
00:28:37,743 --> 00:28:38,724
[SPEAKER_01]: News on Twitter is fake.

400
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:01,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always.

401
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:02,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

402
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it is.

403
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:05,240
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% of the time news on Twitter is fake.

404
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:15,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they were just guessing because they're like, Oh, well, if if, you know, Kevin Afghani is going to be doing the talking flower, then surely they're not going to be doing Mario as well.

405
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, come to find out.

406
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,851
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're actually doing both.

407
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:26,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, Kevin Afghani did announce finally on Twitter that, yes, I am going to be the voice of Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros.

408
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:27,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Water.

409
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:27,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for him.

410
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, he's young.

411
00:29:31,265 --> 00:29:34,706
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's like, he's a baby compared to us.

412
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:39,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, or at least like this guy can be groomed, like late late 20s or something like that.

413
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

414
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, no, I that's not a knock.

415
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I was it's just one of those things.

416
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:52,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wow, it's like, he's a young guy, especially, you know, like, they're, they're assuming that he will be doing the role in future games.

417
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:54,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Because honestly, that is kind of an assumption right now.

418
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:58,197
[SPEAKER_03]: He did not say, I'm the new voice of Mario forever and ever.

419
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:10,905
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I'm the new voice of Mario in Mario Brothers Wonder that, you know, one can infer that likely means you will see him in future games, just as the voice of Bowser is also still in this game.

420
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:12,487
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't change the other voice actors.

421
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:19,231
[SPEAKER_03]: They only changed because Toadette and Peach is also still in this game.

422
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:22,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosalina is not, but I just don't think the character of Rosalina is in the game.

423
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:26,957
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're still using the other Mario voice actors they've been using.

424
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:31,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know those names because of Southern Fried and the panel I did there and getting to meet all them.

425
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're still in Mario Wonder.

426
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just Mario has changed for whatever reason.

427
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:36,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already kind of gotten into that.

428
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:38,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is with Charles Martinet.

429
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:42,268
[SPEAKER_03]: He will make a fabulous living traveling the country.

430
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:47,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if you feel really, really upset that Charles Martinet is gone, go give him your money.

431
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:50,435
[SPEAKER_03]: You will have the opportunity to go give Charles Martinet your money.

432
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:51,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should.

433
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,036
[SPEAKER_03]: You should do that.

434
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:58,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're all assuming that like, you know, it's Nintendo saying that Charles, you can't do this.

435
00:30:58,298 --> 00:30:59,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he just doesn't want to.

436
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like he wants to do it.

437
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just harder for him to do it now or something.

438
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:04,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

439
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:07,762
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what's, you know, going on with Charles.

440
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:11,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's maybe there's some health issues we ever heard about.

441
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:11,964
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you never know.

442
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:15,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wouldn't assume that it's just like, well, you're too old.

443
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:18,166
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to let you go type of thing.

444
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,207
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think

445
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:24,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And people thinking he's too old is honestly ageism at work.

446
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:25,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.

447
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

448
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, people assuming that was the reason.

449
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just be honest.

450
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:33,526
[SPEAKER_03]: They may have and this could be a little bit of a mix.

451
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:38,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm going to say is they may have wanted a new like five year contract or something.

452
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:46,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe when Charles Marnier started to look at a five-year commitment or some type of extended commitment, that could have been, again, I'm totally theorizing.

453
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know shit, but they could have been trying to make a deal of some length.

454
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:58,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe those years commitment was something he didn't want to do because, you know, like, I would like to retire, please.

455
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:07,270
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I have I was just going to say it just fucking sucks that we're sitting here on one hand talking about Bobby Kotick going into forced retirement and the type of money he's going to make.

456
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:10,548
[SPEAKER_03]: That money should be going to Charles Martinet.

457
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:19,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what television judge courtroom program can I go be an advocate on that Bobby Kotick's money should in fact go to Charles Martinet?

458
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,034
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we as gamers make that happen?

459
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:27,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a take on this one.

460
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:28,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.

461
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:42,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And first of all, I doubt Age has anything to do with it, because if June 4-Ray could do, you know, Rocky the Squirrel, you know, well into her 90s, you know, Age has nothing to do with it.

462
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, after a while, yeah.

463
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she didn't do the voice as well as she used to.

464
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,617
[SPEAKER_05]: She still did Natasha, you know, all of it.

465
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

466
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:50,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

467
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:52,966
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know the story.

468
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:54,207
[SPEAKER_05]: No one knows the story.

469
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:58,211
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know the story, you really shouldn't try to speculate an opinion on it.

470
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:00,313
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's how I feel about it.

471
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:08,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, making an opinion without having fact to back it up is, to me, kind of a useless endeavor.

472
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:16,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I just, all I want for him is to be happy and who's ever doing the voice to not fuck it up.

473
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:28,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you lead to a good point because I think a lot of the concern with somebody new coming on was that the internet was going to bully this person into submission.

474
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:32,172
[SPEAKER_03]: The good news is, for the most part, that doesn't appear to be happening.

475
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:35,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the replies on Twitter were pretty positive.

476
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:45,940
[SPEAKER_03]: as he even went so far as to write a follow-up tweet, I think earlier today, that said something in the effect of, I'm really touched by all the nice things people are saying.

477
00:33:45,940 --> 00:34:05,012
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a few naysayers in the comments, and unfortunately, because of the idiot that runs Twitter, who decided to allow people to pay, to literally pay to be dumpster fires and get elevated to the top of the comments, unfortunately, some of the top comments were things like,

478
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:31,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want our Mario to have pronouns in bio and things like that because Kevin Afghani is a good ally who puts he him in his bio because I had hoped at some point Twitter would have just had that as a field that you can put it in such as discord implemented what like not even a year ago you know things like that is that it would just be a field you put it in and it's no big deal

479
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:43,907
[SPEAKER_03]: But because that's not there and it's not going to happen, see my earlier statement about the idiot in charge, he has chosen to put his pronouns in bio and and of course people take issue with that.

480
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:44,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

481
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:46,988
[SPEAKER_05]: The block the block function still exists.

482
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:48,249
[SPEAKER_03]: That sure does.

483
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:50,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's definitely getting some usage there.

484
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just

485
00:34:52,541 --> 00:35:00,147
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, the thing is, I didn't go into this expecting for there to be a lot of hate and trolling and everything.

486
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:09,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Because on average, at least in my experience, Nintendo fans are pretty gracious people, you know?

487
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:20,743
[SPEAKER_05]: The expectations have been set at a certain level that maybe it's not going to be, you know, that if Nintendo is putting out a game,

488
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:28,879
[SPEAKER_05]: they're gonna, you know, bust their ass to make what they really feel is a good Mario game, you know?

489
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:35,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say anything about any of the third parties having seen Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch and wanting to cry.

490
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:37,965
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also know the capability's not there.

491
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:50,993
[SPEAKER_05]: But back to my point, it's, um... I have experienced more positive than negative.

492
00:35:50,993 --> 00:35:51,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself.

493
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, but then again, maybe it's just because I have the majority of the assholes on block already.

494
00:35:58,683 --> 00:35:59,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

495
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:10,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks in chat, like Bobby is saying, have you heard how upset folks get when Nintendo doesn't show the exact trailer they want during a Nintendo Direct, even if they directly tell you what they're going to be talking about?

496
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, here's the thing about that, too.

497
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:21,356
[SPEAKER_05]: That the loudest people out there are going to be the people who complain.

498
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:22,477
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a minority of people.

499
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:39,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like to think that some of it that goes into it is some of the choice to not announce who it was for some time, to allow a little bit of distance of the Charles Martinet retirement or, you know, role change, whatever you want to call it, news, to allow a little distance between that.

500
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:47,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I do think there has been a lot of talk on various social media, not just the one we've been referencing, but, you know, Facebook, Instagram, so forth.

501
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:51,453
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been talk about basically, you know, hey, this is something that's happening.

502
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:55,175
[SPEAKER_03]: whoever is coming into this role can't control what happened.

503
00:36:55,175 --> 00:36:57,717
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not Kevin Afghani's fault.

504
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:00,099
[SPEAKER_03]: This is his opportunity to shine.

505
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So y'all better act right for the new person.

506
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:17,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like there's been time for that message to kind of get around, get around the people really should just act right and give this new guy a chance that for the vast majority, like obviously there's always going to be dumb dumbs on Twitter, but the vast majority of people are giving this person a fair shot.

507
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:18,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's good.

508
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:21,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I would even just go that back to act right.

509
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

510
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:25,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Unqualified.

511
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:27,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean this.

512
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to have a little bit more faith in people, you know, it doesn't often happen.

513
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: But you must not read the comments, which I should tell myself.

514
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:38,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I always remind myself, don't do it.

515
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it.

516
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't help it.

517
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:40,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help it.

518
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:42,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like, why?

519
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:45,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't read the comments because I'm lazy.

520
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:47,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And therefore I'm not disappointed.

521
00:37:49,638 --> 00:37:54,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I knew, I knew if you look at a circus, you're gonna see clowns.

522
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:57,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what the Twitter comments are every fucking time.

523
00:37:57,383 --> 00:38:02,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, I need to learn to not do that.

524
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:07,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly enough, there's something else that I've learned through doing this show.

525
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:10,332
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some opinions that I just don't care.

526
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:10,893
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair.

527
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:11,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fair.

528
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:16,637
[SPEAKER_05]: If I know you, or if you know me as a person,

529
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:20,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take your opinion in good faith.

530
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:32,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're just a person who has never met me in person and only knows me, well, I wouldn't say in person, but a person who... I'm trying to think of how to phrase this.

531
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:37,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't trust the opinions of people on the Internet.

532
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:37,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good policy.

533
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:42,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like I don't know them and they don't know me.

534
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:51,087
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no basis until we have a conversation and I understand the heart of the opinion, then I can make a judgment on it.

535
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:54,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a cute comment in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

536
00:38:54,888 --> 00:39:02,169
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says, I hope there's a cute moment at the game awards where they both present an award together as a passing of the torch kind of thing.

537
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:03,969
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, that's cute.

538
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:04,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love that.

539
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,570
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be nice.

540
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be fair,

541
00:39:07,755 --> 00:39:10,197
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't happen, I don't think we should be disappointed either.

542
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:17,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because there's a part of me that says, if I were Charles Martinet, I could absolutely think, you know what?

543
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:19,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be on that stage.

544
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:21,004
[SPEAKER_03]: This is his moment.

545
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:24,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to do my thing at these, you know, small town conventions around the country.

546
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:24,867
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

547
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:27,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna let him shine on that stage by himself.

548
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:30,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's, that's an a-okay thing to do as well.

549
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:30,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

550
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:34,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, if I were Charles Martinet, I'd be like, where's my margarita?

551
00:39:38,595 --> 00:39:42,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is something that doesn't involve a video game?

552
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:44,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And my margarita.

553
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:48,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna play croquet in my garden, like in Heather's.

554
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:53,139
[SPEAKER_03]: So here would be my suggestion if Charles Martinet politely declines that idea.

555
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:57,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my completely feasible suggestion.

556
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Have Ben Starr do it instead as the Mario passing of the torch and get up there and act all upset that he didn't get the role and do the whole

557
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:10,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I, I heard that you were actually going to be the voice of Mario.

558
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I was going for that role.

559
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I have right bit to be upset right now.

560
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:17,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, have him do that whole thing.

561
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that would be very funny.

562
00:40:19,046 --> 00:40:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that's something that could be done instead.

563
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,649
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

564
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:31,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, best of luck to get I will say, you know what, in the little clips we've heard so far, he's fine.

565
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,732
[SPEAKER_03]: He's gonna do just fine.

566
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:33,433
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be fine.

567
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:35,917
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's going to be fine.

568
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:36,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck.

569
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck to him.

570
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:39,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to hearing what he's got in store for these characters.

571
00:40:39,878 --> 00:40:41,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Destabilize a fandom?

572
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,360
[SPEAKER_05]: We're already unstable people.

573
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamers?

574
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,862
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

575
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:47,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

576
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:48,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some more news.

577
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:50,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about what's going on in PlayStation's world.

578
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:55,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we anticipated that there would probably be a PlayStation 5 mini at some point.

579
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:57,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, it is coming.

580
00:40:57,306 --> 00:41:01,808
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation 5 Slim was officially announced this last week.

581
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:03,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And as some of the rumors said,

582
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:05,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It did line up with this.

583
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:09,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It will have a detachable drive.

584
00:41:09,115 --> 00:41:19,139
[SPEAKER_03]: This means if you buy the PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition, you could change your mind later and spend $80 to get a drive to add to the console.

585
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:23,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So we knew that through some of the trademarks and things that had gone through earlier.

586
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Although not every trademark becomes reality.

587
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:27,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It did kind of seem this was the direction they were going.

588
00:41:28,323 --> 00:41:37,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does, I will say with the little form factor of the device, if you've seen this, it does slide on in a pretty interesting way.

589
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it does look very like

590
00:41:41,290 --> 00:42:03,378
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't stand out like it doesn't look like the HD DVD plugin for the Xbox where it just kind of sat there on the side like it does fit into the shape of where they're going with the PlayStation 5 mini like I it does work so um I think it does does look pretty cool but people have the decision if they want to buy one versus the other however here's the interesting thing

591
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:08,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though the PlayStation 5 Slim is smaller, guess what?

592
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:11,147
[SPEAKER_03]: The Digital Edition will actually cost more money.

593
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:17,208
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be $450 versus the current $400 edition that's out there.

594
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:22,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means if you want one of those digital editions, you better buy it before it's gone.

595
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:33,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you're going to have to hope you luck into one on a Kmart shelf at one of the three Kmarts left in America later on, like that one person who bought a Wii U in September as that story was going around.

596
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:38,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason they were more expensive is because they have more storage on them.

597
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:58,661
[SPEAKER_03]: yes that is true they do have more storage uh so and which if it is a digital edition that makes sense that you'd want to have the one terabyte and all that so there is that uh five hundred dollars if you want to get the uh ultra hd blu-ray disc included drive uh with the system bundle there november is when this rolls out and it will roll out globally

598
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:09,808
[SPEAKER_03]: in the coming months and Sony is confirming when the current PlayStation 5 model has sold out it is no longer going to be made it's done so all right cool

599
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:34,868
[SPEAKER_03]: this is this is the future of PlayStation five but it makes you know it this has been rumored for some time and makes a lot of sense for the holiday the current I'm looking up because I'm looking at my current PlayStation five that's sitting on the same shelf as the devices that run OLR and I it is kind of a big it is a big monster of a system so you know it makes a lot of sense but yeah um

600
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:40,290
[SPEAKER_03]: If you still don't have a PlayStation 5, maybe this will be appetizing to you.

601
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Loki, you're the one I know without a PlayStation 5.

602
00:43:43,175 --> 00:43:44,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this look interesting to you?

603
00:43:45,558 --> 00:43:53,442
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because like, honestly, now it's it's come down to exclusives for Sony and a lot of that stuff ends up coming to PC.

604
00:43:53,442 --> 00:43:55,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, not at this point.

605
00:43:55,483 --> 00:44:00,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's unfortunate because, you know, I would be interested in like PlayStation VR, too.

606
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:04,848
[SPEAKER_01]: But once again, I'm not paying a thousand dollars to jump in for like a couple of games.

607
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:05,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, thanks.

608
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:07,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said I just.

609
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:07,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

610
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:07,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

611
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:09,190
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you didn't have one either, DarkSakura?

612
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you did.

613
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:10,651
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

614
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:11,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you did for some reason.

615
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:15,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And neither do I have one of the Xboxes.

616
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:19,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this... I have to ask, is this tempting?

617
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that they're gonna be slimmer, can fit the shelf easier?

618
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,391
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

619
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:28,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Still not really anything on there I care about.

620
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:29,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with Xbox.

621
00:44:29,572 --> 00:44:34,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'll be perfectly honest, I'm having a lot of fun with just what I'm playing already.

622
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:37,278
[SPEAKER_05]: and I like playing on my Mac.

623
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:50,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and we see that this generation more than any others, a lot of the Sony exclusive quote unquote titles and inherently a lot of the Xbox exclusive titles end up on home computers as well.

624
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's just the fact of this particular generation.

625
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:57,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you wait long enough, Final Fantasy 16 will be out on PC.

626
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:59,130
[SPEAKER_03]: God of War Ragnarok will be out on PC.

627
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all that stuff is going to be on PC eventually.

628
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get it.

629
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:03,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know,

630
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:14,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and also like back to the $1,000 for like PlayStation VR 2 thing, like I also don't trust them to like, you know, make content for that for a very long time.

631
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:23,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're just gonna forget, they're gonna Vita it, you know, they're gonna forget about it eventually once it's not turning them enough of a profit and

632
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:35,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just can't... If, like, the PlayStation VR 2, like, also doubled as, like, a PC VR, then yeah, maybe that might be worth it, but, like, for just what it is...

633
00:45:36,352 --> 00:45:37,493
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll wait.

634
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:45,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I really do want to play, you know, that Rush of Blood, Spiritual Seek, you know, successor, but not that much.

635
00:45:45,902 --> 00:45:51,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's just... That PSVR 2 is on its way to being a disaster of a device.

636
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:52,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not because of the hardware.

637
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The hardware is great.

638
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:55,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... Oh, yeah.

639
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope maybe some changing of the guard at Sony.

640
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:17,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be too late, I don't know, but I hope some changing of the guard at Sony can strategically change the plan for VR a little bit, because right now, that thing is... I don't know what it really looks like sales-wise, but I would be hard-pressed to not believe it's a disaster of a device, because the software is not there to support it.

641
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:29,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like, I'm looking at a Quest 3 even, and I'm on the fence with that even, because I know I will buy it and it will end up in a box.

642
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:35,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have the space for VR, unfortunately.

643
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:39,156
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do like VR, I do like playing VR games.

644
00:46:40,582 --> 00:46:44,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's cumbersome to like set up an area to do that.

645
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:49,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wish it was, you know, I had more space in my house, but I do want one.

646
00:46:49,866 --> 00:46:54,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think it would be great because I have a Rift S and that's pretty old at this point.

647
00:46:54,748 --> 00:47:01,550
[SPEAKER_01]: So even a Quest 3 allowing me to play PC games I have on my PC that, you know, could clearly handle them.

648
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a really good experience.

649
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:08,134
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's move on with some more news.

650
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:10,356
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a completely different type of story.

651
00:47:10,356 --> 00:47:13,018
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

652
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:17,382
[SPEAKER_05]: So well, you know, I like to look at the way video games help society.

653
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:18,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all do.

654
00:47:18,322 --> 00:47:30,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So there, there is a $5 million NIH grant going to Parkinson's research with patients playing video games during brain surgery.

655
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:37,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's looking into how the brain regulates movement.

656
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:58,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So the assistant professor of bioengineering at UC Riverside, and I'm going to try to pronounce his name, Vasileios Christopoulos, is leading a project, it's a five-year project, that lets them study people during surgery with electrodes while they're playing video games.

657
00:47:59,515 --> 00:48:09,838
[SPEAKER_05]: They're collaborating with folks at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Utah Southwestern Medical School, and the University of Iowa.

658
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:20,662
[SPEAKER_05]: He's quoted saying, we will try to understand how our brain controls the actions we perform, how we make decisions between competing goals, how we stop moving, and how we switch actions.

659
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So, which basically that's what Parkinson's does.

660
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:36,785
[SPEAKER_05]: It's involved with action regulation, causing slower movements, difficulty stopping a movement, freezing, having trouble initiating new actions.

661
00:48:36,785 --> 00:48:39,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all related to dopamine.

662
00:48:39,426 --> 00:48:43,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually lose dopamine as the disease progresses.

663
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:49,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the first things they do is provide like a synthetic dopamine for people.

664
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:58,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of the other things to test is dopamine response while you're playing a game.

665
00:48:58,013 --> 00:49:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically they're awake, they have electrodes implanted, they'll play video games with the joystick before, during, and after the surgery to see how the treatment works in real time.

666
00:49:13,258 --> 00:49:28,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that way, the other goal is to use all of this data gathered to build a large-scale mathematical model of the brain so that they will have a machine model that they can test with as well.

667
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:38,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those who don't know, also about Parkinson's, it is the second most common neurodegenerative disease right after Alzheimer's.

668
00:49:38,302 --> 00:49:47,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Roughly 500,000 Americans are diagnosed with it, and it's doubled in the last 25 years, especially in people under 50.

669
00:49:47,844 --> 00:49:53,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, I mean, it is a terminal disease.

670
00:49:53,986 --> 00:49:56,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Having ways of understanding how to combat its

671
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:08,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The speed of its degeneration could certainly give people longer lives with a better quality of life.

672
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:11,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think it's a good idea.

673
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:13,637
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a really good thing they're doing.

674
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:26,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always nice to hear about how video games are kind of used to get those certain types of stimulations in the brain that have these very interesting effects.

675
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:42,879
[SPEAKER_03]: On a somewhat related note, about like video games and that whole type of thing, I was seeing this study going around this week on social media again, I seem to remember this coming up on the show before years ago, but about like, if a child or even an adult experiences some type of traumatic event,

676
00:50:43,559 --> 00:51:08,161
[SPEAKER_03]: playing Tetris is apparently a really good way to help the brain kind of move past in a way that sort of traumatic event because the way that the spatial and the blocks kind of end up going into your brain and so forth help to kind of suppress some of the some of the damage that's happened by such a such a traumatic event, which I find that kind of stuff very fascinating.

677
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:09,162
[SPEAKER_03]: That in person.

678
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:09,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

679
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:14,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Tetris was actually a very useful tool to me, even as an adult, doing anything spatial and puzzle related.

680
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:34,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say things that might have otherwise caused me a meltdown.

681
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:39,630
[SPEAKER_05]: So really good as a way to make the brain work in a different dimension.

682
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

683
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:45,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting that Tetris is like always that game that we come back to.

684
00:51:45,294 --> 00:51:49,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there's probably other puzzle games that also fit the bill.

685
00:51:49,698 --> 00:51:53,039
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously Tetris is by far the most well known of those games.

686
00:51:53,039 --> 00:52:07,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is very interesting that that one in particular, and I have no idea where it fits into this particular study, but just of some of these other, you know, kind of side related sort of things I've been seeing is interesting how it always comes back to Tetris in one way or another.

687
00:52:07,843 --> 00:52:12,284
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Fonz006 says Tetris is good for all.

688
00:52:12,284 --> 00:52:15,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just take two Tetris and call me in the morning.

689
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,471
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

690
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:23,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else to share on that particular exactly study?

691
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:26,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no, just it'd be nice to see what comes of it.

692
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:27,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

693
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,418
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

694
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:33,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And also something to see nice that this has come of this.

695
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, let's go to the next story.

696
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:38,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's about time.

697
00:52:38,117 --> 00:52:57,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, after all of this Unity debacle with the walkbacks and the unpopular change in payment structure, John Riccatello, the CEO of Unity, has decided to retire from Unity.

698
00:52:57,892 --> 00:53:00,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So he is going to be leaving the company.

699
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:02,936
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, it's been my privilege to lead Unity.

700
00:53:02,936 --> 00:53:03,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure no one cares.

701
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:30,312
[SPEAKER_01]: um and so he is going to be helping the company transition to a new ceo at some point and i don't believe a ceo has been uh named yet he's also going to be earning 8.4 million dollars through stock options over the next six months and that's additionally to the 253 million dollars they already has in unity stock but at least

702
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,713
[SPEAKER_01]: That part of the problem is gone.

703
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:40,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the next person they get, not Bobby Kotick, will lead the company in a better direction.

704
00:53:42,241 --> 00:54:07,599
[SPEAKER_03]: it's you know what here's the thing like I could say something sassy or bitchy but the reality is I when this news happened I said where's the accountability and oh well ding ding the accountability train has arrived at the station and guess who it's taking away like finally the thing that is hap that should be happening is happening and so it's like okay this this is good news applause

705
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:08,380
[SPEAKER_01]: accountability.

706
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,080
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels good.

707
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,881
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels good.

708
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:11,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is this.

709
00:54:11,802 --> 00:54:13,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We got what we wanted.

710
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:14,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Our game is happy.

711
00:54:14,203 --> 00:54:15,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

712
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:16,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting the shift.

713
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:19,007
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Bobby Kotick is leaving.

714
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:20,748
[SPEAKER_01]: John Riccatello is leaving.

715
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:25,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the former, you know, higher ups at Ubisoft are being prosecuted.

716
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just starting this.

717
00:54:26,912 --> 00:54:27,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.

718
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:27,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

719
00:54:27,673 --> 00:54:28,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a nice change of pace.

720
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:30,294
[SPEAKER_03]: But since you brought up.

721
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:31,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Hanukkah?

722
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

723
00:54:32,096 --> 00:54:32,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost.

724
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you brought up Bobby Kotick.

725
00:54:35,698 --> 00:54:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what should have happened to Bobby Kotick a long time ago.

726
00:54:38,961 --> 00:54:43,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nice to see that this is happening to John Riccatello.

727
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:48,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And not everybody is going to like what I'm about to say, but too bad.

728
00:54:48,027 --> 00:54:51,450
[SPEAKER_03]: What John Riccatello did is not as bad as what Bobby Kotick did.

729
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,171
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not by far.

730
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:53,912
[SPEAKER_01]: By far.

731
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:57,835
[SPEAKER_01]: John Riccatello is greedy, which is a lot of CEOs are greedy.

732
00:54:57,835 --> 00:54:59,936
[SPEAKER_01]: They make greedy decisions.

733
00:54:59,936 --> 00:55:01,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Bobby Kotick is actually

734
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:03,628
[SPEAKER_01]: a horrible human being

735
00:55:21,723 --> 00:55:25,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Factually way worse.

736
00:55:25,445 --> 00:55:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does kind of suck that the accountability train didn't take him away in the middle of the night.

737
00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:41,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Loki pointed out, it is nice to see this interesting trend in the past few months of accountability trains showing up in different places, which is

738
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Some comments and chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

739
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonz006 says, say it with your chest, Rob.

740
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I will, I will.

741
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:54,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a tear will be shed at these guys leaving.

742
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,935
[SPEAKER_03]: SSG0100Matt says, now do Yves Guillaumon.

743
00:55:57,935 --> 00:56:00,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

744
00:56:00,017 --> 00:56:06,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster says, this really was a rare display of accountability for a CEO after a disaster of this size.

745
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,463
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what has to happen for people to trust Unity again.

746
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:24,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I would argue, in fact, that there will be developers out there who will now say, OK, we're going to trust Unity again because the train took them away.

747
00:56:24,068 --> 00:56:29,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this company maybe is going to be led in a different way, which we can trust Unity again.

748
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:30,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody.

749
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:32,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying like, oh, everybody can just like get over it completely.

750
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:39,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's gonna be more people now that will say, okay, I can work with Unity again.

751
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:41,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

752
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:45,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there are some people that are on board with that.

753
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,230
[SPEAKER_01]: But not everybody.

754
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some people that's like, that's too late, you know.

755
00:56:50,011 --> 00:56:50,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

756
00:56:50,391 --> 00:56:52,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Jamie, what were you saying?

757
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:53,652
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still charging, though.

758
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:55,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

759
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:57,597
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's a very modified version of it.

760
00:56:57,597 --> 00:57:00,219
[SPEAKER_03]: That's completely not like what they originally put out there.

761
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:01,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very different.

762
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

763
00:57:02,181 --> 00:57:05,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a there was a follow up, but I think it might have been one of the weeks you were out.

764
00:57:05,363 --> 00:57:06,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

765
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:07,225
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

766
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:12,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, let's move on and talk about this story, which I find very interesting.

767
00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:18,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to do with AI because you know, our industry can't shut up about this right now.

768
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:19,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand it's everywhere.

769
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:26,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a case of a voice actor being replaced with AI in a video game.

770
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:28,001
[SPEAKER_03]: But the twist is,

771
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:34,131
[SPEAKER_03]: There was permission given in this scenario by the estate of the deceased actor.

772
00:57:34,131 --> 00:57:35,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going on?

773
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:40,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyberpunk 2077, of course, uses a variety of voice actors.

774
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:46,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to horribly mispronounce this name because it's in a language I don't speak, but Milgust Rezek.

775
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:51,129
[SPEAKER_03]: who is a Polish performer who did Polish voice acting in the game.

776
00:57:51,129 --> 00:57:54,890
[SPEAKER_03]: He played the character of Wiktor Vector, but that's in the Polish version of the game.

777
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:01,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've only played the English version of the game, you've never heard the person, but he was important in the Polish version of the game.

778
00:58:01,873 --> 00:58:03,214
[SPEAKER_03]: He passed away in 2021.

779
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:11,317
[SPEAKER_03]: A report came out this week that showed that the studio moved on from this setback with the help of artificial intelligence.

780
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:22,043
[SPEAKER_03]: In a statement to Bloomberg, CD Projekt Red explained that when they developed the Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077, they weighed a few options.

781
00:58:22,768 --> 00:58:24,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Would they replace Rezik?

782
00:58:24,811 --> 00:58:28,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Would they re-record his lines in the base game with the new voice actor?

783
00:58:28,635 --> 00:58:42,111
[SPEAKER_03]: But, as stated by the localization director, Mikolaj Sved, the idea was rejected in favor of AI, which could keep the performance in the game and pay tribute to his wonderful performance as Victor Vector.

784
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:48,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they did, they hired a new voice actor to record all the necessary lines.

785
00:58:48,156 --> 00:58:57,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a voice cloning Ukraine-based software called ReSpeecher made an algorithm to alter the dialogue to sound like Rezek.

786
00:58:57,563 --> 00:59:06,869
[SPEAKER_03]: The use of AI in the Phantom Liberty expansion was done with permission, and that is a very important part of this whole story, from the family.

787
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:08,971
[SPEAKER_03]: The sons were very supportive of this whole thing.

788
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:15,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting because you've seen this sort of permission granted in other places.

789
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:30,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the last week or two, we've seen the story floating around about James Earl Jones, one of the most infamous voices in Hollywood, has given permission for AI to continue to use his voice as the voice of Darth Vader in the future.

790
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:37,287
[SPEAKER_03]: He basically no longer does the role anymore, but in the future, he will be able to do this through AI.

791
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:38,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway,

792
00:59:39,893 --> 01:00:01,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you know, the permission makes this a little more ethically in the clear, but it's still a little bit of a slippery slope because AI as a whole, not just really in gaming, but in Hollywood, we know this is a really key part of where the SAG-AFTRA debate and those negotiations and all that are going on right now is the use of AI.

793
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this is going to continue to be a hot button issue and so forth.

794
01:00:06,988 --> 01:00:08,329
[SPEAKER_03]: some comments in chat.

795
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:10,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest Buster says Bobby clarified on his show.

796
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:14,912
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the localized Polish version of CP 27 seven Phantom Liberty.

797
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I hope I made that clear when I was reading the story.

798
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:22,577
[SPEAKER_03]: The part his character also features in one of the endings you can get based on the decisions.

799
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:27,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So dark to see you said I need to clarify my stance from what I said on Bobby show.

800
01:00:27,479 --> 01:00:32,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the family's blessing carries a little more weight than the naysayers on social media.

801
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:37,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to say something here.

802
01:00:37,495 --> 01:00:39,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't like this.

803
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

804
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:42,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

805
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:43,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Please let me finish.

806
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:49,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that ethically, does this clear this a little bit more ethically and so forth?

807
01:00:49,044 --> 01:00:49,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

808
01:00:49,424 --> 01:00:51,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have a problem with it on that front.

809
01:00:52,713 --> 01:01:07,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I love the idea of AI permanently giving people parts for the rest of time, because it doesn't allow other people to ever take on the role.

810
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:21,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I think about things like on Broadway, where you very oftentimes have many, many, many people that come in and play a role, you know, and I think about let's think about a play that's been on Broadway for forever, like Chicago,

811
01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:22,409
[SPEAKER_03]: JynxMonsoon

812
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:43,705
[SPEAKER_03]: got to live their lifelong dream of being on Broadway, playing the part of Mama Morton in the production.

813
01:01:43,705 --> 01:01:50,029
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I saw Chicago on Broadway like 10 years ago, the Mama Morton I saw that night was great as well.

814
01:01:50,029 --> 01:01:54,212
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a lot of very talented people that have gone through that production over the years.

815
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:59,375
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is, I feel like if we keep relying on AI like this, it's going to allow... I mean,

816
01:02:00,992 --> 01:02:05,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if they'd done Charles Martinet's voice through AI, with his permission or whatever.

817
01:02:05,795 --> 01:02:12,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like it would, it would, it would rob these other up and comers of this opportunity to take on the role.

818
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would never get to see other takes on characters.

819
01:02:16,202 --> 01:02:18,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, I walk a weird line with this.

820
01:02:18,364 --> 01:02:21,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Because yes, I understand ethically, it's fine with permission, everything.

821
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:22,707
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when it's like,

822
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:29,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a cameo or something like I think about Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.

823
01:02:29,951 --> 01:02:33,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to spoil too much, but had a cameo somewhere.

824
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a very brief thing to tie a story to somewhere else.

825
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:39,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about.

826
01:02:39,216 --> 01:02:39,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll leave it at that.

827
01:02:40,196 --> 01:02:46,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and like a cameo like that, like it bothers me a lot less, because I'm just kind of like, okay, I get it.

828
01:02:46,121 --> 01:02:51,425
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to like tie it to a very specific timeline, and a very specific iteration of that role.

829
01:02:51,425 --> 01:02:52,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have permission or whatever.

830
01:02:52,907 --> 01:02:55,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sits a little better with me.

831
01:02:55,649 --> 01:02:59,332
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, should someone own a role forever and ever?

832
01:02:59,332 --> 01:02:59,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

833
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:02,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm just I, I don't think I love it.

834
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:04,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry, Loki, I know you're trying to jump in there.

835
01:03:04,336 --> 01:03:04,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've said a lot.

836
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:05,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

837
01:03:06,207 --> 01:03:11,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I was going to say, my only worry about it is now where they're giving the permission.

838
01:03:11,669 --> 01:03:23,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I worry that in the future you'll have actors that will get permission through like a contract, but then the company is going to manipulate that contract to a point where it's like, well, now we just own your voice.

839
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:26,136
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need you anymore, you know, type of thing.

840
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm worried that people are going to get into that scenario.

841
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:32,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, you know, at least the

842
01:03:33,759 --> 01:03:43,944
[SPEAKER_01]: SAG-AFTRA is going to be, you know, trying to prevent that type of scenario from happening, so hopefully there's something that comes of that, but I still worry.

843
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:59,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't trust corporations like this, like, because especially of all the, like, shady stuff that they've done, like, I don't doubt that they're going to try to find a way to manipulate that, so it's like, oh, hey, we'll just, you know, we'll use this voice forever.

844
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It's forever now, you know, so I don't know.

845
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:12,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see what Rob is saying.

846
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: When the game version of Scarface was being worked on, they approached Al Pacino to do the part, but he said he just didn't sound the same as he did during the 80s, but he suggested another voice actor to take on the role instead.

847
01:04:25,288 --> 01:04:35,337
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL says it puts a new definition of generational wealth and less opportunities for lower class in the future to rise up in social class.

848
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:39,921
[SPEAKER_03]: SHO100mat talking about the SAG strikes.

849
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:41,563
[SPEAKER_03]: The background actor thing is scary.

850
01:04:41,723 --> 01:04:43,484
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

851
01:05:17,392 --> 01:05:24,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel about AI in general and the fact that companies want to use it without having to offer pay.

852
01:05:25,637 --> 01:05:39,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly, I think that when you're dealing with a role that's iconic, like Vader, or going back to another example, you know, de-aging actors.

853
01:05:39,886 --> 01:05:46,850
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about, I know Bobby had talked about that on his show earlier.

854
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:51,753
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I am fine if permission is granted.

855
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:54,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at these roles as legacies.

856
01:05:55,693 --> 01:06:08,698
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a way to keep the iconic voice and even the brand of the character alive after the originator is gone.

857
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:13,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's like having a painting, in my opinion.

858
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,741
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said.

859
01:06:16,741 --> 01:06:21,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I. For the ones who are using things like

860
01:06:23,175 --> 01:06:34,318
[SPEAKER_05]: machine learning to generate voices to do these things without paying an actor to do it.

861
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:37,939
[SPEAKER_05]: The estates are still being paid for the deceased.

862
01:06:37,939 --> 01:06:42,300
[SPEAKER_05]: The actors are still being paid for their permission.

863
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you are using generated voices that are not given with express permission, that are learned voices,

864
01:06:53,324 --> 01:06:59,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't have to pay the talent, you're just creating a voice.

865
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,069
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I have the problem with.

866
01:07:01,069 --> 01:07:14,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that are leading to basically preventing someone who could have provided that new voice for a new character or a new narration or

867
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:28,022
[SPEAKER_05]: or just anything like it's really prevalent a lot on on certain YouTube videos out there and they're not paying they're not paying people for these roles they're they're renting a machine to do it you know

868
01:07:29,902 --> 01:07:34,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, yeah, there are some roles that, yeah, it's fine for a recast.

869
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:42,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how many times do we have a TV show come out and have, you know, characters from a movie recast and have them be much better?

870
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:45,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Buffy.

871
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:48,009
[SPEAKER_03]: James Bond, I think, is a great example.

872
01:07:48,009 --> 01:07:51,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right, but the whole thing behind his is kind of like The Doctor.

873
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:51,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

874
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:56,132
[SPEAKER_05]: He regenerates into a different Bond, you know.

875
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:56,772
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um,

876
01:07:58,222 --> 01:08:05,947
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that in the case of a very iconic role, there's that.

877
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:12,812
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past, it wasn't technologically possible to do.

878
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:13,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it is.

879
01:08:13,812 --> 01:08:23,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, for these voices that we got to grow up listening to, I think it's great that people are going to get to keep it.

880
01:08:23,278 --> 01:08:23,839
[SPEAKER_05]: But again,

881
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:30,882
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes back to paying the actor and paying their estate.

882
01:08:30,882 --> 01:08:31,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You see where the difference is?

883
01:08:45,104 --> 01:08:45,624
[SPEAKER_03]: fine plays.

884
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:54,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no problem with what's going on here with the AI voice actor thing because they got permission and so forth.

885
01:08:54,950 --> 01:09:05,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen in Final Fantasy XIV where, yeah, they did recast the character in a later expansion because the one couldn't come back for whatever reason, and it was fine.

886
01:09:05,277 --> 01:09:07,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Soap operas do recasting all the time and so forth.

887
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:07,959
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just

888
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:14,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I sort of understand like, you know, and I kind of reference like the legacy character, like, you know, Carrie Fisher and all that stuff.

889
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, it was a short little cameo.

890
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:17,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It was to tie it together.

891
01:09:17,281 --> 01:09:17,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

892
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:18,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

893
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:24,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, you know, and if it's the same thing with Vader, where it's just a line or two, then whatever, like, I don't think it's as big of a deal.

894
01:09:24,963 --> 01:09:32,224
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, if I just don't want to see AI used to make somebody the main character again, type of thing, like recast the part of it's gonna go there.

895
01:09:32,224 --> 01:09:35,105
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's where I'm kind of like, on the fence.

896
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:35,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

897
01:09:36,218 --> 01:09:44,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as far as what you get what you pay for when it comes to AI in some ways, I thank you chat who did post the clip here.

898
01:09:44,183 --> 01:09:51,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize to the podcast listeners, but I am going to show this here real quick for those that are watching on our Twitch channel here.

899
01:09:51,307 --> 01:09:56,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody on TikTok actually oops, sorry, their audio came through too.

900
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I had it muted.

901
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, folks.

902
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:00,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually see there.

903
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:03,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that and then look at that look at that crowd.

904
01:10:03,294 --> 01:10:04,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And that AI like is that person you

905
01:10:06,283 --> 01:10:10,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that looks you get what you pay for.

906
01:10:10,325 --> 01:10:12,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm completely against that.

907
01:10:12,466 --> 01:10:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: They they are composite people.

908
01:10:15,748 --> 01:10:22,452
[SPEAKER_05]: They likely did not get any permission from the people whose likenesses went to train that machine.

909
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:24,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

910
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:32,557
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is what I am against, things that are creating free labor from the work of other people.

911
01:10:32,557 --> 01:10:32,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

912
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:43,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for, to go back to the, you know, the Vader thing, the machine learned one voice and one voice only, and the voice got paid.

913
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:57,241
[SPEAKER_05]: But when, say that, say that you go on one of those AI art things and like, I want a picture of a cat riding a unicorn playing guitar, but I want it done in the style of Da Vinci.

914
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:06,546
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's taking all of the various, you know, it's stealing from a master, number one.

915
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:12,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stealing from all the other artwork that came before it to teach that AI to create this image.

916
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:18,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, a lot of those are like, pick which one is more like what you want.

917
01:11:18,196 --> 01:11:25,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're getting the people who are paying you for the service to train your AI for free.

918
01:11:25,983 --> 01:11:27,204
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I...

919
01:11:29,237 --> 01:11:31,201
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where my problem is.

920
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:35,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I want there to be accreditation where it's due.

921
01:11:35,168 --> 01:11:37,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the people that contribute it paid for.

922
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:38,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Or paid to, I should say.

923
01:11:39,934 --> 01:11:53,343
[SPEAKER_05]: and not being used as a quick replacement for avoiding having to hire extras or avoiding having to hire, you know, for other things.

924
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Having to hire your artist, having to hire your graphic designer.

925
01:11:56,985 --> 01:12:00,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And another thing too, and I know that Fixie has brought this up before,

926
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:12,598
[SPEAKER_05]: is there are people now who are soliciting to create artwork for independent content creators out there.

927
01:12:12,598 --> 01:12:17,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are paying, you know, $50, $100, $200 for something.

928
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:24,049
[SPEAKER_05]: And these people are just generating AI art and sending it to them like they made it themselves.

929
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:25,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And that right there is fraud.

930
01:12:27,905 --> 01:12:48,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the only thing is that these people can't claim any copyright on any of this work, but there has to be a set ethical standard for the use of AI in art, including voice acting, singing, artwork, acting, you name it.

931
01:12:51,152 --> 01:12:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's go ahead and move on.

932
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:58,898
[SPEAKER_03]: This is unfortunately the AI thing, just like the Activision Blizzard Microsoft thing.

933
01:12:58,898 --> 01:13:00,379
[SPEAKER_03]: This ain't the last we're going to hear about it.

934
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:08,185
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hear much, much more, especially as the game industry tries to figure this out, along with the film industry, like where those lines end up getting drawn.

935
01:13:08,185 --> 01:13:10,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to find that out from ongoing contract negotiations.

936
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,689
[SPEAKER_05]: would do if they could get away with it.

937
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:14,650
[SPEAKER_03]: If they could get away with it.

938
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:18,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's why we have SAG-AFTRA to stop that.

939
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

940
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:22,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on, though.

941
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:28,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to a cinematic classic since we're talking about film, DarkSakura.

942
01:13:28,942 --> 01:13:30,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

943
01:13:30,063 --> 01:13:39,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and Dan messaged this to me earlier while I was busy working, and so I just kind of stopped and was like, oh,

944
01:13:41,385 --> 01:13:51,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a mystery pinball company out there in existence that randomly announced that they were doing a labyrinth table.

945
01:13:51,813 --> 01:13:55,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And it turns out that the company is called Barrels of Fun Pinball.

946
01:13:55,196 --> 01:14:01,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like their logo icon, which is basically a flipper and a bald and like an exclamation point.

947
01:14:01,862 --> 01:14:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's great.

948
01:14:04,305 --> 01:14:11,774
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some really amazing people who are involved in this project.

949
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:20,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian Savage, and a few more.

950
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:25,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a trailer out for the game and it looks amazing.

951
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:32,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So they did get permission to use David Bowie's voice, lines from the film, to use his likeness.

952
01:14:33,812 --> 01:14:43,757
[SPEAKER_05]: No view of Jennifer Connelly, but I think the point of the game is that they're putting you as the protagonist in this, that you're traversing the labyrinth.

953
01:14:43,757 --> 01:14:45,877
[SPEAKER_05]: There are lots of sound clips from the movie.

954
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:59,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling that there's an oubliette mode, because I thought I saw, you know, heard a line from the oubliette and saw some of the things on the table.

955
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:04,981
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a full motion video screen, kind of like the Jersey Jack tables.

956
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:05,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

957
01:15:06,286 --> 01:15:12,247
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nice, the mock-up art scenery from the movie.

958
01:15:12,247 --> 01:15:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a little busy for side art myself, but it's really... I'm really impressed by it.

959
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I really am impressed by it.

960
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,071
[SPEAKER_05]: The play field looks beautiful.

961
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:29,691
[SPEAKER_05]: There are tons of figures all over it.

962
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we even have a...

963
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:36,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Ludo, Jennifer Connelly, Sordidimus,

964
01:15:52,855 --> 01:15:58,139
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with that disturbing song and that whole business.

965
01:15:58,139 --> 01:15:59,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Creepy.

966
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,223
[SPEAKER_05]: They have like little pop up heads in the table.

967
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:07,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's it's a beautiful thing.

968
01:16:07,165 --> 01:16:10,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I one of Dan's friends already ordered one.

969
01:16:13,655 --> 01:16:15,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks it looks really good.

970
01:16:15,836 --> 01:16:17,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way the table looks.

971
01:16:17,396 --> 01:16:21,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was trying to show a shot on stream, but I got the wrong trailer.

972
01:16:21,937 --> 01:16:24,618
[SPEAKER_03]: But I finally found at least an image of what that looks like there.

973
01:16:24,618 --> 01:16:30,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously Bowie very heavily featured in the artwork as DarkSakura was kind of saying there with the big video screen and all that stuff.

974
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks the table does look gorgeous.

975
01:16:32,539 --> 01:16:36,360
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not to mention the songs from the movie are in it.

976
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's awesome.

977
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:40,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm I'm stoked.

978
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:42,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm and I'm sure

979
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:56,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I read something about Toby, the guy that played the baby, who's now a puppeteer himself.

980
01:16:56,519 --> 01:16:59,142
[SPEAKER_05]: He was involved with it too, but I'd have to go back and look.

981
01:16:59,142 --> 01:17:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm totally, totally down.

982
01:17:05,378 --> 01:17:11,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I should address this comment here because I'm sure many people that have seen this table were curious about this.

983
01:17:11,366 --> 01:17:18,676
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, I'm guessing the guy from Southern Fried Game Expo, I forget his name but I did see it mentioned on Twitter, is probably going to have to retire his custom table.

984
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:29,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that still remains what it always was, a fan project and fan love that brought that.

985
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:39,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, one could even argue that maybe the visibility that came with that getting all the press may have, who knows, led to what we're seeing now.

986
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:41,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that still plays an important role.

987
01:17:42,194 --> 01:17:45,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But are you gonna see him charging people to play that table?

988
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,516
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that he was not gonna be able to do, but he never did.

989
01:17:47,516 --> 01:17:48,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Or try to sell it.

990
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,037
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he never did.

991
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:52,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a thing that was at expos.

992
01:17:52,438 --> 01:17:55,239
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a, you know, passion project type of thing.

993
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:57,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, and that's where that will remain.

994
01:17:57,701 --> 01:18:00,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume that table still has a place next year.

995
01:18:01,402 --> 01:18:09,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a very to see that somebody hand painted a table and converted like that still is a piece of art in its own way.

996
01:18:09,864 --> 01:18:12,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, these two things can coexist.

997
01:18:12,545 --> 01:18:22,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's hard not to bring that up in light of, you know, this this news, but I still say that just remains what it is, a really incredible fan project.

998
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:38,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and there are so many there are so many modded tables that go to conventions and whatnot, people who've done their own theming of them that it like and even companies are doing it with their own tables, putting out different skins for them.

999
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:46,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I know the Halloween table is also the same one for.

1000
01:18:46,008 --> 01:18:47,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1001
01:18:47,029 --> 01:18:51,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same as another one, and I don't remember what it is.

1002
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Halloween.

1003
01:18:52,271 --> 01:18:53,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll look it up.

1004
01:18:53,131 --> 01:18:53,311
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1005
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultraman.

1006
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,901
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1007
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:01,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I played them both in the same expo.

1008
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:02,263
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1009
01:19:02,263 --> 01:19:08,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's move on from pinball to Loki, one of your favorite games that you create a lot of content about.

1010
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:09,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1011
01:19:09,406 --> 01:19:09,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1012
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:11,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Minecraft Live was today.

1013
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:14,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically kind of like the Nintendo Direct of Minecraft.

1014
01:19:14,587 --> 01:19:15,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of.

1015
01:19:15,248 --> 01:19:17,529
[SPEAKER_01]: They do different announcements.

1016
01:19:17,529 --> 01:19:19,409
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about the next update.

1017
01:19:19,409 --> 01:19:23,751
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of the merger, World of Warcraft will now be playable in Minecraft.

1018
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:23,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1019
01:19:25,013 --> 01:19:31,291
[SPEAKER_01]: uh no no announcement of that yet yet um

1020
01:19:32,021 --> 01:19:37,403
[SPEAKER_01]: They did announce some more DLC regarding Star Wars and Minecraft.

1021
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:40,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do these like DLC map things every once in a while.

1022
01:19:40,885 --> 01:19:47,808
[SPEAKER_01]: So now there's going to be a brand new one that's coming out that's based around it's Star Wars Path of the Jedi.

1023
01:19:47,808 --> 01:19:52,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's coming on the marketplace November 7th.

1024
01:19:52,009 --> 01:19:57,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be able to play as a Padawan during the Clone Wars.

1025
01:19:57,452 --> 01:19:58,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to do all that kind of stuff.

1026
01:19:58,972 --> 01:19:59,452
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked pretty cool.

1027
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:08,098
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, of course, they talked about Planet Earth, you know, that thing that's coming out from the BBC.

1028
01:20:08,098 --> 01:20:10,239
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing DLC with that as well.

1029
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,740
[SPEAKER_01]: They did one for the second one as well.

1030
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:15,301
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, other announcements.

1031
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:19,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So Minecraft is turning 15 years old next year.

1032
01:20:19,602 --> 01:20:22,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be some interesting things with that.

1033
01:20:22,163 --> 01:20:26,184
[SPEAKER_01]: They've also sold 300 million copies of the game.

1034
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few, you know.

1035
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:36,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with that, of course, there's going to be the new update, so 1.21 coming out next year.

1036
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:43,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that we got to see with that, they announced a brand new structure called a Trial Dungeon.

1037
01:20:44,636 --> 01:20:51,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that they've got these trial spawners that spawn unique monsters based on the number of players that you have around.

1038
01:20:51,823 --> 01:20:58,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those is a new monster called the Breeze, which it blows air and it's kind of like an air elemental type thing.

1039
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:03,071
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has some cool interactions with like redstone stuff.

1040
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto-crafting is coming to the game.

1041
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:24,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to have a thing called the Crafter which allows you to actually set recipes and feed blocks into it and they'll actually craft up other items so you can incorporate that into automatic farms and stuff to help either compress some of the drops that you get or to make whatever.

1042
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:25,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of creative things.

1043
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:26,598
[SPEAKER_05]: This game plays itself.

1044
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:56,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't play itself but like people make a lot of automated farms like I have a gold farm for example that I just built and it drops gold nuggets and gold nuggets take up a lot of space so you can compress those down into ingots which you know it takes nine nuggets to one ingot and then you can compress that down into blocks which nine ingots to a block so you can have that all done automatically so your storage isn't like full and you don't have to sit there you know sorting gold nuggets into a crafting bench

1045
01:21:56,890 --> 01:22:00,391
[SPEAKER_01]: for I think it takes me like 10 minutes.

1046
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:03,152
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long time after an AFK session.

1047
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:05,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all that stuff you can do.

1048
01:22:05,293 --> 01:22:08,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, there's some of the crafting recipes like the dispenser.

1049
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:12,495
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really mass create those.

1050
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:15,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could do that as well with this.

1051
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:20,237
[SPEAKER_01]: New copper and new tough blocks are going to be added to the game as well.

1052
01:22:20,237 --> 01:22:22,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a mob vote between

1053
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:37,541
[SPEAKER_01]: a penguin crab and armadillo in the armadillo one so we get an armadillo well justice for penguin it exactly i voted penguin i voted because you're a man of taste

1054
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:39,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.

1055
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:45,606
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why the armadillo vote, so there's different gameplay elements that come along with the mob.

1056
01:22:45,606 --> 01:22:53,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So the crab is going to drop a claw that allows you to reach farther and place blocks and pickup blocks further away.

1057
01:22:53,291 --> 01:23:01,076
[SPEAKER_01]: The armadillo gives you, it drops scoot, which you can be crafted into dog armor and people love their dogs.

1058
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:07,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the penguin allowed your boats to go faster.

1059
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was cool because the penguins are cute.

1060
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:11,963
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like clumsy on land.

1061
01:23:11,963 --> 01:23:13,844
[SPEAKER_01]: They would fall down a lot, which was cool.

1062
01:23:13,844 --> 01:23:15,205
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave it the worst ability.

1063
01:23:15,205 --> 01:23:15,985
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that's.

1064
01:23:15,985 --> 01:23:16,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1065
01:23:16,406 --> 01:23:19,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what that's what it came down to is people.

1066
01:23:19,207 --> 01:23:24,051
[SPEAKER_01]: People vote based off of the gameplay element, not what the creature is.

1067
01:23:24,051 --> 01:23:26,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, Armadillo is fine.

1068
01:23:26,552 --> 01:23:27,853
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my second choice.

1069
01:23:27,853 --> 01:23:28,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Crab was kind of.

1070
01:23:29,597 --> 01:23:30,197
[SPEAKER_01]: dumb.

1071
01:23:30,197 --> 01:23:43,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, like the argument I've been making is like, oh, I wish it should if we've gotten crab how long until we have just oodles and oodles of YouTubes with people reenacting crab crab rave in Minecraft, right?

1072
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:51,122
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that would have had to have been incorporated into the game because they have it where you can play like music discs for paint or not pick was up for parrots and they'll dance.

1073
01:23:51,122 --> 01:23:55,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, they should have just enabled that for crabs.

1074
01:23:55,543 --> 01:23:55,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But

1075
01:23:56,793 --> 01:24:21,799
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i mean the the argument like one of the big things that people were pushing this year is stop the mob vote which they don't want the mob vote as it is and and i agree the way it should be is that these mobs are being developed and it's like hey we're gonna put out these mobs you know in the next couple updates which one do you want first you know we'll develop this one first and then you get all three that's how it should be but instead they're like

1076
01:24:22,675 --> 01:24:30,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we'll just put these other ones in our logs somewhere and eventually maybe come to the game.

1077
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:32,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they said that they did that with the frogs.

1078
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:39,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I don't remember ever having a mob vote with a frog, but allegedly that's what they said.

1079
01:24:39,044 --> 01:24:42,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the only example of mobs that they've, you know,

1080
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,453
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown aside for different things.

1081
01:24:45,453 --> 01:24:46,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't agree with that.

1082
01:24:46,654 --> 01:24:57,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you're going to, you know, incorporate some of these things, like, for example, was it a couple mob votes ago, they had the Glow Squid, the Moobloom, and the Ice Ologer.

1083
01:24:57,641 --> 01:25:01,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of those, actually, all three of those came from other games.

1084
01:25:01,664 --> 01:25:04,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So two of them from Minecraft Earth, one from Minecraft Dungeons.

1085
01:25:04,846 --> 01:25:09,989
[SPEAKER_01]: All the models in the voice, you know, lines and sound effects and stuff are all done already.

1086
01:25:09,989 --> 01:25:11,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you have those models.

1087
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,571
[SPEAKER_01]: They are literally sitting on

1088
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:21,657
[SPEAKER_01]: a vast library of, you know, mob models that are just out there and they just don't want to spend the time to incorporate them into the game.

1089
01:25:21,657 --> 01:25:27,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Like modders were already, day one, when these were announced, already had them functional in the game.

1090
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:35,067
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you can't tell me that, like, your team of developers can't put these in the game, all three of them.

1091
01:25:35,067 --> 01:25:37,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's going to be too much manpower to do that.

1092
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:40,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that one bit.

1093
01:25:40,271 --> 01:25:41,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

1094
01:25:43,228 --> 01:25:49,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, at least this update, there's something I'm excited about with the different, the new structures and the automatic crafting.

1095
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:54,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the last update was like, I'm not really excited about any of it.

1096
01:25:54,558 --> 01:26:02,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, you know, I say it was better than last year, but I think that the mob vote really needs to be retooled.

1097
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:05,286
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, but that's right.

1098
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:08,389
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to just stuff the ballot box for Penguin next time.

1099
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:09,910
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it needs to be.

1100
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried.

1101
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried voting Penguin, but you know.

1102
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:14,394
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't send me the link.

1103
01:26:14,394 --> 01:26:15,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't vote Penguin.

1104
01:26:15,195 --> 01:26:16,475
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1105
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:17,895
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1106
01:26:17,895 --> 01:26:18,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this story.

1107
01:26:18,816 --> 01:26:21,877
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of folks in our Discord were talking about this story earlier this week.

1108
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:29,259
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to join the discussion during the week, you sure can over at vognetwork.com slash discord, especially there being no live show next week.

1109
01:26:29,259 --> 01:26:34,461
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to talk to us about news that breaks next week, I would highly encourage you to do that over at our Discord server.

1110
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:37,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, vognetwork.com slash discord.

1111
01:26:37,182 --> 01:26:40,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how many of you heard about this, but there was a limited time

1112
01:26:40,663 --> 01:26:43,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Trading Card for the game that was released.

1113
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:49,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Pokemon Cross Van Gogh called Pikachu with Gray Felt Hat.

1114
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:58,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a take on a very similar piece of work by Vince Van Gogh, which I'm going to show there on the other screen there.

1115
01:26:58,397 --> 01:27:03,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So for folks that are looking on our Twitch channel, you can see how, yes, it's very inspired there.

1116
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:09,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually kind of looks like one of those AI things, but this was done by an actual person, I'm assuming.

1117
01:27:11,706 --> 01:27:18,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course it sold out instantly because people flooded the museum.

1118
01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:24,651
[SPEAKER_03]: There's chaotic scenes of what this looked like at a museum, mind you, the Van Gogh Museum.

1119
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:29,093
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just what chaos looks like all over YouTube.

1120
01:27:29,093 --> 01:27:33,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like Toys R Us on Black Friday back in the day where people were

1121
01:27:34,055 --> 01:27:37,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, jumping on top of each other to get Cabbage Patch Kids and all this stuff.

1122
01:27:37,496 --> 01:27:39,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just wild.

1123
01:27:39,437 --> 01:27:40,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what was happening here.

1124
01:27:40,637 --> 01:27:44,398
[SPEAKER_03]: People were climbing over each other to get whatever merchandise they could.

1125
01:27:44,398 --> 01:27:45,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And why?

1126
01:27:45,478 --> 01:27:46,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was being scalped.

1127
01:27:46,959 --> 01:27:51,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Scalper, scalper, scalpers trying to buy it up so that they can go profit off of that online.

1128
01:27:52,322 --> 01:28:00,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Company has revealed you can still get this item via the Pokemon Center website.

1129
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,653
[SPEAKER_03]: On the website, they announced this.

1130
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:07,297
[SPEAKER_03]: What will happen is that the promo card, if you do one Pokemon Center order,

1131
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:13,103
[SPEAKER_03]: containing a Pokemon trading card game product.

1132
01:28:13,103 --> 01:28:18,708
[SPEAKER_03]: While supplies last, you can get one Pikachu with gray felt hat promo card.

1133
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:24,673
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're basically having to shift it all online because people don't know how to act right in person.

1134
01:28:24,673 --> 01:28:26,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And scalpers are going to scalp.

1135
01:28:26,514 --> 01:28:30,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there's a lot of people that are quick to blame the scalpers.

1136
01:28:30,237 --> 01:28:30,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.

1137
01:28:30,978 --> 01:28:32,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You should.

1138
01:28:32,019 --> 01:28:36,163
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that really need to be blamed are the people that buy from scalpers.

1139
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:42,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that because it's only enabling all of this behavior and putting the stuff into it.

1140
01:28:42,996 --> 01:28:43,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.

1141
01:28:43,877 --> 01:28:48,381
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always going to be people with that kind of money to spend that are going to pay the premium for it.

1142
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:50,263
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, that's where the blame lies.

1143
01:28:50,263 --> 01:28:58,371
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the people that are buying and to some extent, it's places like eBay where this shit thrives and goes unchecked completely.

1144
01:28:58,371 --> 01:28:58,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1145
01:28:59,452 --> 01:29:04,418
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's whatever I realized it's a it's a very large kind of problem to take on.

1146
01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:09,483
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the whole thing just to kind of see that go down in a museum is really, really gross.

1147
01:29:09,483 --> 01:29:10,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's sad.

1148
01:29:10,564 --> 01:29:19,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I I also kind of hope it's a lesson learned in a way like I'm sometimes I wonder does Pokemon not understand how popular they are?

1149
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:20,315
[SPEAKER_01]: They know.

1150
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:39,750
[SPEAKER_03]: but but when things like this happen or like when Pokemon go even first launched on mobile phones in 2016 and it was like it was so popular it was screwed up like do they not know how popular Pokemon is sometimes I wonder it's just I mean it's it's not a bad problem to have but

1151
01:29:41,271 --> 01:29:47,893
[SPEAKER_03]: SG100 Matt says, honestly, they probably wouldn't do these trading card things again because of it, which hurts everyone.

1152
01:29:47,893 --> 01:29:52,714
[SPEAKER_03]: MikeDef says, they know, but for some reason they lack the logistics for this kind of stuff.

1153
01:29:52,714 --> 01:29:58,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because they gave it to the museum to do, but the museum also lacks the logistics for this stuff.

1154
01:29:58,256 --> 01:30:05,578
[SPEAKER_03]: MikeDef says, granted, after that first day, the thing got under control, but there were people outside the museum harassing people that came out

1155
01:30:06,018 --> 01:30:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy the card and made it pretty uncomfortable for visitors.

1156
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:12,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the people fucking outside a concert.

1157
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any tickets to sell?

1158
01:30:14,741 --> 01:30:16,941
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm fucking here to see the show.

1159
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:20,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have tickets to sell.

1160
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when you know video games weren't things we were going to see in a museum anytime soon in this next segment.

1161
01:30:40,608 --> 01:30:48,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1162
01:30:48,313 --> 01:30:51,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1163
01:30:51,575 --> 01:30:56,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the Classic Game this week?

1164
01:30:56,078 --> 01:31:01,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked Dragon Ball Z's Super Butouden 2.

1165
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:03,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked the second one on purpose, because I like it better than the first one.

1166
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:14,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game that came out in 1993, developed by Tose and published by Bandai for the Super Famicom.

1167
01:31:14,449 --> 01:31:23,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's based, of course, off of the Dragon Ball franchise and is the sequel to Dragon Ball Z's Super Butoden that came out earlier that year for Super Famicom.

1168
01:31:24,197 --> 01:31:29,160
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is cooler because it is The Cell Game.

1169
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:37,866
[SPEAKER_05]: This is probably one of the better story arcs, although, dear lord, it still went on for freaking ever.

1170
01:31:37,866 --> 01:31:46,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And also has some of the movie characters that came out around the same time, like the Borori and Bojack movies.

1171
01:31:48,942 --> 01:31:53,283
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, it uses a six-button configuration to play with.

1172
01:31:53,283 --> 01:31:57,244
[SPEAKER_05]: You have special moves and different playable modes.

1173
01:31:57,244 --> 01:32:01,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's done by the same team.

1174
01:32:01,104 --> 01:32:03,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really improves on the previous one.

1175
01:32:03,645 --> 01:32:08,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So it brings in the tournament mode and has more characters.

1176
01:32:08,086 --> 01:32:18,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really is considered, while it's similar to Super Butoden, it's a little bit, I'd say, it's better.

1177
01:32:19,068 --> 01:32:27,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the pinnacle of that era was Super Butouden 3, but I'm saving that for another day.

1178
01:32:27,032 --> 01:32:44,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the Super Butouden 2, one of the neat things about it, and this is actually a fairly common thing for the Dragon Ball games, is this sort of split-screen thing that happens when the characters are far apart.

1179
01:32:48,076 --> 01:33:02,448
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole point of it is to give this sense of distance and feeling and, you know, you have your aerial attacks and your ground attacks and of course when you're closer together, you know, the little divider goes away.

1180
01:33:02,448 --> 01:33:09,453
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got all kinds of neat special moves that are basically related to their moves in the series.

1181
01:33:12,809 --> 01:33:22,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, it's one of the ways that you can just get a little bit more of that epic feel that the show is known for.

1182
01:33:22,814 --> 01:33:27,876
[SPEAKER_05]: You also have water arenas that are added for this one.

1183
01:33:27,876 --> 01:33:31,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You have counterattack specials.

1184
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:38,301
[SPEAKER_05]: You have meteor combos for consecutive attacks.

1185
01:33:38,301 --> 01:33:40,742
[SPEAKER_05]: In the previous game, only Goku had that.

1186
01:33:42,903 --> 01:33:56,504
[SPEAKER_05]: But at any rate, the people who worked on it had some funny nicknames like JC Pajama.

1187
01:33:56,504 --> 01:33:57,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was funny.

1188
01:33:57,505 --> 01:33:57,886
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

1189
01:34:00,512 --> 01:34:05,856
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game was a real big success.

1190
01:34:05,856 --> 01:34:20,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It was released in Japan on December 17th, 1993, and they actually did release it in Europe in April 1994, and then published in June 1994 by Bandai.

1191
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:27,311
[SPEAKER_05]: In French, it was Dragon Ball Z Legend Slayer, as in Saiyajin Legend.

1192
01:34:28,953 --> 01:34:39,387
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an album of the music that was published in Japan by Columbia Records and had arranged versions of some of the songs.

1193
01:34:39,387 --> 01:34:44,454
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an English version for Latin America that had been made and never released.

1194
01:34:45,956 --> 01:34:56,964
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2015, the Japanese version of Super Butouden 2 was included as a pre-order bonus for Dragon Ball Z Extreme Butouden for Nintendo 3DS.

1195
01:34:56,964 --> 01:35:03,930
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was for people who ordered in the UK through Game or in the US through Amazon that had a code for the title.

1196
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:07,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was its first official release in the United States.

1197
01:35:08,433 --> 01:35:13,656
[SPEAKER_05]: The game was at the top of Famitsu's charts in December 1993.

1198
01:35:13,656 --> 01:35:22,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a success, lifetime sales between 1.15 million according to Famitsu, and 1.2 million units alone in Japan.

1199
01:35:22,961 --> 01:35:24,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in Japan alone, sorry.

1200
01:35:25,703 --> 01:35:27,845
[SPEAKER_05]: had really good music.

1201
01:35:27,845 --> 01:35:34,411
[SPEAKER_05]: To this day, Trunks' theme is like the best music in any video game ever.

1202
01:35:34,411 --> 01:35:41,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what anyone says, it's like one of the best ever pieces of music in a game.

1203
01:35:41,036 --> 01:35:48,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so it's also the first Dragon Ball game I ever owned.

1204
01:35:49,203 --> 01:35:50,784
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have a story about it.

1205
01:35:50,784 --> 01:36:08,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I traded my entire VHS run of Gyver that I had at the time for the entire Cell Game fan subbed and Super Butouden 2 and Super Butouden together.

1206
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:11,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was the cool kid that had the Dragon Ball games in the 90s.

1207
01:36:13,006 --> 01:36:16,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, well before, you know.

1208
01:36:16,467 --> 01:36:20,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I was totally into... I hate to do the hipster thing.

1209
01:36:20,509 --> 01:36:23,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Dragon Ball Z when it was only on Japan.

1210
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,671
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was totally into it.

1211
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:26,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that was my jam.

1212
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:29,332
[SPEAKER_05]: That and Sailor Moon and Ranma 1.5.

1213
01:36:29,332 --> 01:36:36,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the holy trinity of anime back then.

1214
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:40,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And... Oh, that series got me through my first couple years of college.

1215
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:45,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I still have my copies.

1216
01:36:45,832 --> 01:36:47,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I love them.

1217
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:57,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I think the biggest one that was supposed to have eclipsed them was Hyperdimension that came out much later, but I'll be talking about those at some point in the future.

1218
01:36:58,001 --> 01:36:59,742
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1219
01:36:59,742 --> 01:37:02,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Just reading some comments from chat here, remembering this game.

1220
01:37:02,745 --> 01:37:07,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Sjohn100mat says, this was a must have when ROM downloading was a thing.

1221
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:12,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And OrangeWrite says, definitely check this game out during my introduction to SNES emulation.

1222
01:37:12,492 --> 01:37:15,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember to delete the ROM after 24 hours.

1223
01:37:15,795 --> 01:37:16,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just laughing.

1224
01:37:16,655 --> 01:37:21,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how did anybody ever believe that legally that was a thing?

1225
01:37:21,299 --> 01:37:26,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and to answer OrangeWrite on here, I also had a Dragon Ball GT Final Bout.

1226
01:37:27,822 --> 01:37:34,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish I had kept it when I did because it ended up being worth a lot more money until it got a re-release.

1227
01:37:34,647 --> 01:37:44,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But I traded my copy of that game for Blue Stinger on Dreamcast, the Japanese one.

1228
01:37:44,074 --> 01:37:47,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, Blue Stinger was a better game.

1229
01:37:47,957 --> 01:37:49,078
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1230
01:37:49,078 --> 01:37:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.

1231
01:37:49,838 --> 01:37:53,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say I beat Blue Stinger like three times.

1232
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:56,403
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your classic game of the week.

1233
01:37:59,032 --> 01:38:06,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we saw more show to come at you here, including some other headline stories in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1234
01:38:06,557 --> 01:38:08,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll talk about them quickly because it's rapid fire.

1235
01:38:08,918 --> 01:38:10,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1236
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:20,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is kind of strange, but Microsoft Flight Simulator is getting some new DLC for the Juice Goose.

1237
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:21,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's the juice?

1238
01:38:21,746 --> 01:38:22,987
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the Juice Goose?

1239
01:38:22,987 --> 01:38:25,088
[SPEAKER_01]: It is some sort of ATV.

1240
01:38:27,182 --> 01:38:32,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may be wondering, well, what's that have to do with Microsoft Flight Simulator?

1241
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:34,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I don't know.

1242
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:45,410
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently it is something that you can get for $15 and it's actually it's like allows you to drive it.

1243
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:45,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1244
01:38:46,218 --> 01:38:56,952
[SPEAKER_01]: and like go off jumps and go like drive it in the dunes and stuff so it's kind of weird to see Microsoft Flight Simulator to have like driving sim stuff in there as well.

1245
01:38:56,952 --> 01:39:03,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's less weird when you consider this is a third party mod and Flight Sim is enabled for the sale of third party mods.

1246
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:06,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes it less weird.

1247
01:39:06,502 --> 01:39:23,576
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say, you know, I am interested in this because I, you know, the flight sim, the graphics are so incredible in that game and the way, you know, it generates the actual real world based off of, you know, existing satellite imagery and all that stuff, which I haven't played the game in a while.

1248
01:39:23,576 --> 01:39:30,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they've updated it because there's a lot of newer areas in my part of town that, you know, are just fields.

1249
01:39:30,742 --> 01:39:31,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1250
01:39:48,044 --> 01:39:49,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I check it out.

1251
01:39:49,405 --> 01:39:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 15 bucks is a little expensive.

1252
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:53,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Just when I don't know what I'm getting into.

1253
01:39:53,930 --> 01:40:05,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's if there's some really good like trailers of other people playing it not not like a super cut trailer, but like actual gameplay from a streamer or somebody check I would they could maybe sway me.

1254
01:40:05,842 --> 01:40:08,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be very curious what it looked like.

1255
01:40:08,205 --> 01:40:10,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1256
01:40:10,467 --> 01:40:10,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway,

1257
01:40:11,031 --> 01:40:19,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And then along with that, I'm very excited because Earth Defense Force 6 is being localized for North America.

1258
01:40:19,112 --> 01:40:19,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring 2024.

1259
01:40:19,613 --> 01:40:23,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out on PlayStation 5 and PC.

1260
01:40:23,693 --> 01:40:27,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cannot wait because I love me some Earth Defense Force.

1261
01:40:27,314 --> 01:40:30,955
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a trashy game and.

1262
01:40:30,955 --> 01:40:34,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And I eat that trash up.

1263
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy for you, Loki.

1264
01:40:37,356 --> 01:40:39,276
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on, DarkSakura.

1265
01:40:40,423 --> 01:40:46,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a game called Spin Rhythm XD coming out on Switch.

1266
01:40:46,086 --> 01:40:54,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be out October 26th, my brother's birthday, the good brother, with also its first DLC.

1267
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:58,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now it's available on a computer.

1268
01:40:58,312 --> 01:41:01,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Spin Digital is releasing it.

1269
01:41:01,774 --> 01:41:03,494
[SPEAKER_05]: The orders are up as of October 19th.

1270
01:41:05,816 --> 01:41:10,458
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's already been on Early Access on Steam.

1271
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:25,067
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as songs that will be in the first DLC, just all name a couple, Crazy by Tokyo Machine, It's All Over by Shock One, Overkill by Riot, a few of those songs.

1272
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:35,964
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like a kinetic music game and it has over 60 licensed and original tracks in the game already.

1273
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:40,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks pretty.

1274
01:41:40,166 --> 01:41:43,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, kind of.

1275
01:41:43,088 --> 01:41:45,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Spinny guitar hero-ish.

1276
01:41:45,889 --> 01:41:54,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this game was a GDQ the last time around, and Alan streamed this before, so it's yeah, it's it's for music game stuff.

1277
01:41:54,774 --> 01:41:55,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty it's pretty cool.

1278
01:41:55,835 --> 01:41:56,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

1279
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:56,475
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

1280
01:41:57,144 --> 01:41:58,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1281
01:41:58,465 --> 01:42:02,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, talking about Windjammers 2.

1282
01:42:02,889 --> 01:42:04,470
[SPEAKER_03]: There is going to be a free update.

1283
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:06,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out for Windjammers 2.

1284
01:42:06,172 --> 01:42:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It adds new playable characters.

1285
01:42:08,414 --> 01:42:15,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamma GX-03, an android with well-balanced power and speed, and Anna Salinski.

1286
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:25,108
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also going to be new modes added to the game, lessons mode and practice modes, as well as some new online features, including creating a lobby, which seems like a very basic thing.

1287
01:42:25,108 --> 01:42:25,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But

1288
01:42:25,648 --> 01:42:27,709
[SPEAKER_03]: The big thing is crossplay.

1289
01:42:27,709 --> 01:42:36,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So now players on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation can join Steam and Xbox, who I guess were already linked, together in online matches.

1290
01:42:36,432 --> 01:42:37,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.

1291
01:42:37,173 --> 01:42:44,435
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of that, online ranking is being erased and going back to zero because of all this new stuff with everything that's being unleashed.

1292
01:42:44,435 --> 01:42:45,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

1293
01:42:45,636 --> 01:42:47,497
[SPEAKER_03]: The update just came out.

1294
01:42:47,497 --> 01:42:50,858
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can check that all out if you are a Windjammers fan.

1295
01:42:52,265 --> 01:42:57,427
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see what else is coming out very soon in our world release dates.

1296
01:42:57,427 --> 01:42:59,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?

1297
01:42:59,928 --> 01:43:02,930
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things are coming out in the U.S.

01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:04,771

1304
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be.

1305
01:43:30,702 --> 01:43:34,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm wondering if it's also like some of the remakes as well.

1306
01:43:34,527 --> 01:43:38,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, they milk that franchise for money wherever they can.

1350
01:47:59,504 --> 01:48:01,345

1357
01:48:42,684 --> 01:48:44,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what is coming out on the Switch.

1358
01:48:44,224 --> 01:48:47,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopping over to the PlayStation 5 and looking at the releases there,

[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that release to look forward to on the 20th in a regular or collector's edition.

1380
01:50:47,162 --> 01:50:48,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1381
01:50:48,563 --> 01:50:50,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was muted and I was talking.

1382
01:50:50,465 --> 01:50:56,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say, all right, there's plenty to pick from around the world there, no matter where it is that you live.

1383
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:58,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's move on to some more news.

1384
01:50:58,953 --> 01:51:02,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will open up our phone lines and all that good stuff.

1385
01:51:02,456 --> 01:51:03,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, Loki.

1386
01:51:05,025 --> 01:51:12,909
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation Plus Premium is going to start allowing you to stream certain PlayStation 5 games via cloud streaming.

1387
01:51:12,909 --> 01:51:19,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to be supporting, they say, hundreds of titles through this new offering.

1388
01:51:19,992 --> 01:51:25,215
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now while they're beta testing it for the next couple months, they're going to have top PlayStation 5 hits.

1389
01:51:26,095 --> 01:51:28,716
[SPEAKER_01]: that are available from your PlayStation Plus catalog.

1390
01:51:28,716 --> 01:51:37,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the games they mention Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Horizon Forbidden West, Ghost of Tsushima, Mortal Kombat 11 and Saints Row 4.

1391
01:51:37,477 --> 01:51:39,978
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also going to have timed demos for certain games.

1392
01:51:39,978 --> 01:51:48,320
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hogwarts Legacy, The Witcher 3 and Callisto Protocol are going to be available as like a timed demo type thing.

1393
01:51:50,405 --> 01:51:59,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also you'll be able to stream some games that you've purchased as well, as well as some free-to-play titles.

1394
01:51:59,113 --> 01:52:02,576
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Fortnite, Genshin Impact, that type of stuff.

1395
01:52:05,582 --> 01:52:12,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, they say that they're going to support resolutions up to 4K and 60 FPS.

1396
01:52:12,103 --> 01:52:20,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recommend, I guess, about 38 megabits per second transfer speed in order for that to be supported.

1397
01:52:20,725 --> 01:52:26,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, enhanced sound as well, so they're going to support different surround sound methods.

1398
01:52:26,886 --> 01:52:30,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah.

1399
01:52:30,486 --> 01:52:31,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the... Was it right now?

1400
01:52:31,847 --> 01:52:32,747
[SPEAKER_01]: The subscription, I think, is $160.

1401
01:52:34,912 --> 01:53:03,493
[SPEAKER_01]: for 12 months so it's going to be I get up from the 120 it was before or 160 for a year yeah just make sure that's clear uh it is going to be trying to give something to justify that price increase but it's still bullshit i'm sorry yeah um it's going to be a phased rollout they said starting in japan on october 17th and europe is going to be the 23rd and north america october 30th

1402
01:53:05,098 --> 01:53:21,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now it's available in quite a few countries, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg.

1403
01:53:21,426 --> 01:53:26,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of country, a lot of the European regions, UK and US.

1404
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:27,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

1405
01:53:27,949 --> 01:53:30,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

1406
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:30,711
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1407
01:53:30,711 --> 01:53:31,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1408
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:33,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not excited about it still hasn't sold me on, you know,

1409
01:53:35,582 --> 01:53:36,265
[SPEAKER_01]: on all this stuff.

1410
01:53:37,753 --> 01:53:41,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they're playing catch up with Game Pass right now.

1411
01:53:41,455 --> 01:53:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1412
01:53:41,795 --> 01:53:43,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It still doesn't justify the price increase.

1413
01:53:43,476 --> 01:53:48,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, they're playing catch up, but it's still it's going to be half assed because they're still doing the phased rollout slow.

1414
01:53:48,659 --> 01:53:55,282
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hopefully it works well, but it's also streaming like I like I get it like streaming's cool.

1415
01:53:55,282 --> 01:54:03,926
[SPEAKER_01]: In practice, streaming is a cool idea, but it just in this reality that we live in with bandwidth caps and that may not necessarily be the case in other countries.

1416
01:54:03,926 --> 01:54:05,707
[SPEAKER_01]: But like in the United States, it's it's

1417
01:54:06,407 --> 01:54:09,890
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, you may have the controller to do just that, right?

1418
01:54:22,698 --> 01:54:26,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I am kind of on the fence about this one.

1419
01:54:26,881 --> 01:54:31,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Retro-Bit has Sega Saturn Pro controllers.

1420
01:54:31,204 --> 01:54:38,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like they actually have both kinds of connector on it.

1421
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:43,694
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a reproduction of the Saturn controller, which honestly, it's the one I do not prefer to use.

1422
01:54:43,694 --> 01:54:47,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer to use the analog controller.

1423
01:54:47,536 --> 01:54:49,037
[SPEAKER_05]: But they

1424
01:54:51,122 --> 01:54:55,727
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have smaller analog controllers at the bottom center.

1425
01:54:55,727 --> 01:55:08,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems kind of awkward to me, but they come in the black and gray of the American one and the white and gray for the Japanese one.

1426
01:55:08,601 --> 01:55:09,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually the...

1427
01:55:11,234 --> 01:55:16,137
[SPEAKER_05]: They just look very, very, very nice.

1428
01:55:16,137 --> 01:55:24,421
[SPEAKER_05]: The compatibility is for PC, Mac, and quote, other USB enabled devices.

1429
01:55:24,421 --> 01:55:28,103
[SPEAKER_05]: They... I don't know.

1430
01:55:28,103 --> 01:55:30,284
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not... They don't look clunky.

1431
01:55:30,284 --> 01:55:31,965
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like Saturn controllers.

1432
01:55:31,965 --> 01:55:34,326
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like you could play Street Fighter with them.

1433
01:55:34,326 --> 01:55:36,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, cool.

1434
01:55:36,167 --> 01:55:36,387
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1435
01:55:38,097 --> 01:55:42,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, let's move on to some other retro style type of games.

1436
01:55:42,758 --> 01:55:44,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1437
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:54,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, well, I mean, retro in the sense that it, you know, we used to talk about, you know, games getting pirated before release.

1438
01:55:54,081 --> 01:55:57,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, what do you... 2D side-scrollers, but yes.

1439
01:55:57,801 --> 01:55:59,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go fake it.

1440
01:55:59,222 --> 01:56:01,922
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a big temple title like Super Mario Bros.

1441
01:56:01,922 --> 01:56:04,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonder has, of course, leaked online and

1442
01:56:07,083 --> 01:56:10,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And Color Me Not Surprised.

1443
01:56:10,072 --> 01:56:11,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.

1444
01:56:12,705 --> 01:56:18,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it is interesting that some gameplay video was on social media that was quickly taken down.

1445
01:56:18,149 --> 01:56:22,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nintendo, of course, already has their legal team and fire alarms going off.

1446
01:56:22,773 --> 01:56:24,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't don't stream this.

1447
01:56:24,555 --> 01:56:28,318
[SPEAKER_03]: If you if you somehow luck into an early copy, don't do this.

1448
01:56:28,318 --> 01:56:29,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it's legit.

1449
01:56:29,559 --> 01:56:31,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo is notorious about sharing this.

1450
01:56:31,981 --> 01:56:34,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they shut that shit down before release dates.

1451
01:56:34,142 --> 01:56:39,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely don't post on YouTube or anything like that because they're the Nintendo legal department's coming for you.

1452
01:56:39,587 --> 01:56:39,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1453
01:56:40,287 --> 01:57:03,880
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not that much longer right what like five more days and then the game's finally out so yeah you can you can do it you can get there everybody all right well another game that was getting a bit a bit of chat in our discord uh which i thought was kind of funny uh was this new soccer title that's coming out from EA but it's not what you think uh it is a soccer turn by turn turn-based strategy game

1454
01:57:04,613 --> 01:57:07,274
[SPEAKER_03]: EA Sports FC Tactical

1455
01:57:21,478 --> 01:57:24,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Mobile titles coming out for iOS and Android in early 2024.

1456
01:57:24,381 --> 01:57:34,811
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very interesting version of the game coming out, but they're calling it, quote, authentic football action like never before.

1457
01:57:34,811 --> 01:57:38,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Matches are simulated, so you don't actually control the players' actions.

1458
01:57:38,775 --> 01:57:43,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, you focus on strategies like player stamina and power play management.

1459
01:57:43,897 --> 01:57:48,479
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do online friendly matches and what they call intense online competitions.

1460
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:52,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just ranked matches, leagues, guilds, all that type of stuff.

1461
01:57:52,600 --> 01:58:04,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some promotional screenshots out there that show like a one on one battle going on where you see the numbers that skills skill up against each other things like skills like dribbling, one, two, passing, shooting,

1462
01:58:05,285 --> 01:58:10,172
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe a skill move power up thing that you can use there.

1463
01:58:10,172 --> 01:58:21,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, 5,000 licensed players from more than 10 top leagues, probably very similar to what you have in the mainline games, you can train to upgrade moves, unlock new traits, and so forth.

1464
01:58:22,087 --> 01:58:31,309
[SPEAKER_03]: EA Sports FC Tactical embraces strategic gameplay to create an all-new football experience that immerses players in the world's game like never before.

1465
01:58:31,309 --> 01:58:36,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a quote from Vice President of EA Sports, Nick Wlodicka.

1466
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:37,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I said that right.

1467
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:42,611
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is available for pre-registration on iOS and Android ahead of the January 18, 2024 launch.

1468
01:58:46,195 --> 01:58:50,500
[SPEAKER_03]: This may surprise you that I'm going to say this, but I think this is a great idea.

1469
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:54,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is good because I think this is what a mobile soccer game should be.

1470
01:58:54,303 --> 01:58:59,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good that they're not trying to recreate the arcade action and that whole sort of thing.

1471
01:58:59,909 --> 01:59:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing something that makes sense.

1472
01:59:02,632 --> 01:59:04,113
[SPEAKER_03]: for mobile.

1473
01:59:04,113 --> 01:59:06,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think this is the first time EA has done this before.

1474
01:59:06,815 --> 01:59:08,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, ZenMonkey11 points this out in chat.

1475
01:59:08,657 --> 01:59:11,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, I thought they did one for American football.

1476
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:13,000
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been done a few years back.

1477
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,521
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Football Tactics.

1478
01:59:14,521 --> 01:59:16,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess it was turn-based soccer at the time.

1479
01:59:16,783 --> 01:59:20,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was an American football one too, but, and it's brilliant.

1480
01:59:20,545 --> 01:59:22,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on console and PC.

1481
01:59:22,627 --> 01:59:27,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So, which, I mean, I think it's interesting.

1482
01:59:27,851 --> 01:59:29,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just a different type of

1483
01:59:30,968 --> 01:59:33,650
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of fancy strategy type of game.

1484
01:59:33,650 --> 01:59:34,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see anything wrong.

1485
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:39,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think people are just like, wait, it's a soccer game, but you're doing it like strategy.

1486
01:59:39,373 --> 01:59:40,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why not?

1487
01:59:40,534 --> 01:59:44,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's different, and I don't like it.

1488
01:59:44,596 --> 01:59:47,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes a lot of sense for mobile.

1489
01:59:47,478 --> 01:59:53,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes a lot, a lot of sense for mobile, and takes my biggest complaint about mobile games and removes it.

1490
01:59:53,481 --> 01:59:59,446
[SPEAKER_03]: ZenMonkey11 wants to point out the game he was talking about was a game that is not connected to EA, it was made by an indie dev, and was part of Early Access.

1491
01:59:59,446 --> 02:00:00,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for clarifying.

1492
02:00:24,003 --> 02:00:25,984
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our last story that we had slotted.

1493
02:00:25,984 --> 02:00:33,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then we're going to get to the listener roundtable where we invite your phone calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1494
02:00:33,726 --> 02:00:35,967
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also invite your emails.

1495
02:00:35,967 --> 02:00:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.

1496
02:00:40,229 --> 02:00:41,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we have one tonight.

1497
02:00:41,809 --> 02:00:42,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1498
02:00:42,409 --> 02:00:44,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

1499
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:45,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, LR.

1500
02:00:45,290 --> 02:00:49,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to chime in on a couple of things you mentioned last week.

1501
02:00:49,072 --> 02:00:50,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, YYR.

1502
02:00:50,772 --> 02:00:51,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I always know from the greeting.

1503
02:00:53,738 --> 02:00:56,901
[SPEAKER_05]: The new release of Astro Smash was mentioned.

1504
02:00:56,901 --> 02:01:03,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the new version of Astro Smash released last week on Steam, Xbox, and Switch.

1505
02:01:03,828 --> 02:01:07,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might have assumed that Intellivision Entertainment was behind this release.

1506
02:01:07,231 --> 02:01:13,518
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you look at the fine print, you will see that both the developer and publisher listed as BBG Entertainment.

1507
02:01:13,518 --> 02:01:13,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

1508
02:01:13,858 --> 02:01:14,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this, you might ask?

1509
02:01:16,130 --> 02:01:25,074
[SPEAKER_05]: BBG Entertainment is a small developer based in Germany that claims to have more than 10 employees and freelancers, according to their website.

1510
02:01:25,074 --> 02:01:34,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Its founder and president had started a mobile game developer in 2001, became successful enough in 2005, it was purchased by Disney.

1511
02:01:34,398 --> 02:01:40,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, BBG seems to have based its business on acquiring classic IPs and releasing new versions of these games.

1512
02:01:40,701 --> 02:01:44,563
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2017, for example, they acquired the rights for Boulder Dash.

1513
02:01:46,091 --> 02:02:04,366
[SPEAKER_05]: In May of this year, BBG announced that they had successfully acquired the IPs of both Astro Smash and Shark Shark, two of the most popular Intellivision games of all time.

1514
02:02:04,366 --> 02:02:12,313
[SPEAKER_05]: The agreement specifies that Intellivision Entertainment retain the ability to self-release future versions of these games on their own consoles if they are released.

1515
02:02:12,793 --> 02:02:24,039
[SPEAKER_05]: but otherwise gives BBG everything else, so if you choose to drop $15 on either the new Astra Smash or Shark Shark, know that your money is going to BBG, not Intellivision Entertainment.

1516
02:02:28,030 --> 02:02:34,455
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, the games themselves are clearly identical gameplay-wise to the versions that would have released on Amico.

1517
02:02:34,455 --> 02:02:43,442
[SPEAKER_05]: If you compare Intellivision's own Deep Dive videos from some time ago with the trailers for the 2023 BBG releases, they look exactly the same.

1518
02:02:43,442 --> 02:02:46,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to weigh in, I think this whole thing is pretty sad.

1519
02:02:46,124 --> 02:02:54,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Intellivision Entertainment, or what's left of it, is apparently so desperate to stay afloat that they are getting rid of their only thing of value, their IPs.

1520
02:02:55,445 --> 02:03:01,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that wonderful Intellivision Lives collection on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC?

1521
02:03:01,988 --> 02:03:08,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if there's going to be anything like that in the future, they will be missing those two games because they don't even own them anymore.

1522
02:03:08,731 --> 02:03:10,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Sigh.

1523
02:03:10,532 --> 02:03:15,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, excuse me while I place a pre-order for a DDR machine I can actually fit into my apartment.

1524
02:03:16,596 --> 02:03:21,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Regarding that amazing looking DDR mini cabinet, there are a few tidbits you might have missed.

1525
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:26,724
[SPEAKER_05]: One, they will be announcing more songs for it over the coming months, including licenses.

1526
02:03:26,724 --> 02:03:37,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, you can use it to play the overpriced but arcade perfect DDR Grand Prix on PC, which I intend to do for double charts as I have no room for two stages.

1527
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:47,303
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being built by the same folks behind the Taito E-Grit 2 Mini and the Sega Astro City Minis, which means it's going to look and feel amazing.

1528
02:03:47,303 --> 02:03:51,664
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're outside of Japan, you can use a proxy service like Tenso.com to order one.

1529
02:03:51,664 --> 02:03:57,926
[SPEAKER_05]: These services will give you a virtual Japanese address and then forward stuff onto you.

1530
02:03:57,926 --> 02:03:59,807
[SPEAKER_05]: They're reasonably priced and work very well.

1531
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:02,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's also Rakuten I think will do it.

1532
02:04:03,649 --> 02:04:06,751
[SPEAKER_05]: The US dollar is worth more against the Japanese yen right now.

1533
02:04:06,751 --> 02:04:09,073
[SPEAKER_05]: One dollar is worth 150 yen.

1534
02:04:09,073 --> 02:04:12,996
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are going to order this thing, now would be a great time to do it.

1535
02:04:12,996 --> 02:04:14,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, thanks for the show.

1536
02:04:14,458 --> 02:04:15,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy your week off and be well.

1537
02:04:15,899 --> 02:04:17,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be sick for three weeks like me.

1538
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:17,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

1539
02:04:17,941 --> 02:04:18,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Cough, cough.

1540
02:04:18,661 --> 02:04:19,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Erin YYR.

1541
02:04:20,083 --> 02:04:23,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like $299 is what it ends up being US.

1542
02:04:23,844 --> 02:04:28,465
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still pretty pricey, but yeah, I mean, I get it for the hardcore DDR fans.

1543
02:04:28,465 --> 02:04:35,827
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's especially the fact that you can actually put a stage in it and, you know, it works with DDR PC and all that stuff.

1544
02:04:35,827 --> 02:04:36,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1545
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:42,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know if you saw, but like they did add some new songs as I heard they did get some licenses after all.

1546
02:04:42,309 --> 02:04:42,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1547
02:04:42,529 --> 02:04:43,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1548
02:04:43,049 --> 02:04:44,610
[SPEAKER_01]: We got you got Captain Jack.

1549
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:47,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got Captain Jack Grindale and the race.

1550
02:04:47,991 --> 02:04:48,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

1551
02:04:50,443 --> 02:04:51,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a jam, let them move.

1552
02:04:51,884 --> 02:04:54,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta have let them move, you know, and get up and move.

1553
02:04:54,446 --> 02:04:55,867
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we don't have to have that.

1554
02:04:55,867 --> 02:04:59,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently you're gonna have it if they're force feeding it to you.

1555
02:04:59,189 --> 02:05:09,276
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they did make their goal like within three hours, they said, and it's still gonna be up for another 43 days.

1556
02:05:09,276 --> 02:05:10,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks it's cool.

1557
02:05:10,697 --> 02:05:11,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a lot of

1558
02:05:14,762 --> 02:05:27,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually want to go back real quick to the Intellivision part because I actually did figure Intellivision themselves did not put this out on Switch because I don't think Intellivision was making any games in-house.

1559
02:05:27,887 --> 02:05:34,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were contracting with organizations and that type of contract that you outlined there makes a lot of sense.

1560
02:05:34,569 --> 02:05:37,190
[SPEAKER_03]: You make the game and we're going to sell it as us.

1561
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:42,251
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we relinquish those rights, then you can sell it as yourselves, which is what is happening here.

1562
02:05:42,251 --> 02:05:50,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I am actually surprised and a little bit stunned that Intellivision does not get a cut of those sales.

1563
02:05:50,694 --> 02:05:54,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that means, what do they get out of this besides a one-time fee?

1564
02:05:55,934 --> 02:06:06,883
[SPEAKER_03]: to pay creditors by selling off what is one of the biggest in television exclusives, which are few and far between.

1565
02:06:06,883 --> 02:06:09,685
[SPEAKER_05]: They get the dink smell of desperation.

1566
02:06:09,685 --> 02:06:12,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it's just unfortunate.

1567
02:06:12,647 --> 02:06:18,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's nice that the game developers can get a little bit of something, something back, you know, and have it out there in the world, I guess.

1568
02:06:18,432 --> 02:06:23,576
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am not expecting to be blown away by Astro Smash.

1569
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:24,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put it that way.

1570
02:06:25,117 --> 02:06:26,758
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, we'll see.

1571
02:06:26,758 --> 02:06:39,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll, you know, like I said about another game earlier on, instead of a sizzle reel, I'll watch a streamer or a YouTuber, like a real person that hopefully I know, actually play the game and kind of give some thoughts there before I make up my mind on it.

1572
02:06:39,989 --> 02:06:45,854
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not I'm not expecting a lot to be quite honest.

1573
02:06:45,854 --> 02:06:50,618
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, you know, yeah, it is it is kind of sad what happened.

1574
02:06:50,618 --> 02:06:53,220
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very obvious the Amico is never coming out at this point.

1575
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:57,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's what it is.

1576
02:06:57,310 --> 02:07:00,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very sad that this is now what Intellivision's legacy is.

1577
02:07:00,731 --> 02:07:02,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad.

1578
02:07:02,731 --> 02:07:05,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1579
02:07:05,152 --> 02:07:05,832
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1580
02:07:05,832 --> 02:07:09,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you know what's interesting?

1581
02:07:09,193 --> 02:07:17,134
[SPEAKER_03]: For better or for worse, that former CEO got raped through the coals harder on the internet than Bobby Kotick probably did.

1582
02:07:17,134 --> 02:07:20,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that's interesting.

1583
02:07:20,775 --> 02:07:21,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not here to defend

1584
02:07:23,272 --> 02:07:27,276
[SPEAKER_03]: anything, but I just I just think that's interesting.

1585
02:07:27,276 --> 02:07:34,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all I'm getting that where people will spend their time and money and who they're going to direct their anger to in the gaming world.

1586
02:07:34,903 --> 02:07:37,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's interesting.

1587
02:07:37,726 --> 02:07:39,668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1588
02:07:39,668 --> 02:07:41,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1589
02:07:41,089 --> 02:07:48,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with that, I think we are to the point where I can go around and ask if there are any last minute stories to share tonight.

1590
02:07:48,096 --> 02:07:48,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1591
02:07:50,514 --> 02:08:14,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently there was a Tekken 7 tournament part of EGX 2023 and apparently this anti-oil protest group called Just Stop Oil decided to interrupt the finale by spreading paint on the monitors of the two people competing and spraying the stage with water guns.

1592
02:08:15,655 --> 02:08:31,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I would like to, you know, remind a lot of these, um, tournaments, um, or presentation, you know, in the, these different events in the gaming industry, you gotta up your security, man.

1593
02:08:31,107 --> 02:08:35,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Like someone's going to get killed in one of these things, you know, sure.

1594
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:45,057
[SPEAKER_01]: They're protesting and spraying paint, but who let them into an event anyways with paint in the first place or a water gun, like,

1595
02:08:47,638 --> 02:08:50,040
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of security do you guys have at these events?

1596
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:50,981
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.

1597
02:08:50,981 --> 02:08:53,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I get it.

1598
02:08:53,803 --> 02:08:56,846
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, anti-oil is fine, you know, if you want to protest it.

1599
02:08:56,846 --> 02:08:59,008
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, what does that have to do with Tekken 7?

1600
02:08:59,008 --> 02:09:03,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are the people that are like playing Tekken like pro-oil?

1601
02:09:03,792 --> 02:09:05,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

1602
02:09:05,113 --> 02:09:09,076
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it seems like a really weird thing.

1603
02:09:09,076 --> 02:09:09,217
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

1604
02:09:12,352 --> 02:09:13,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.

1605
02:09:13,132 --> 02:09:21,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, as pointed out in chat, the, uh, group that did this is the same group that did this, uh, with the Van Gogh, you know, painting and all this stuff.

1606
02:09:21,794 --> 02:09:26,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Bobby Blackwell says they want you to talk about it and doing it at a tech and event did it.

1607
02:09:26,395 --> 02:09:34,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I suppose, yeah, that's all attention is good attention type of things, but I guess I, I don't know.

1608
02:09:34,156 --> 02:09:38,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I know in the case of the internet trolls, that's especially the case, but yeah.

1609
02:09:39,865 --> 02:09:42,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to respond to this comment too on something we were saying earlier.

1610
02:09:42,346 --> 02:09:46,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So YYR in chat said, Kotick was a jerk, but not a liar.

1611
02:09:46,328 --> 02:09:49,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Tommy basically lied about absolutely everything.

1612
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:54,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I know your comment is well intentioned, but I'm sorry, Bobby Kotick was absolutely a liar.

1613
02:09:54,272 --> 02:09:58,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time he covered up, he lied to the public every day.

1614
02:09:58,514 --> 02:10:00,776
[SPEAKER_03]: about what was really going on at that company.

1615
02:10:00,776 --> 02:10:04,739
[SPEAKER_03]: He lied in hiding the abuse that was happening towards the employees.

1616
02:10:04,739 --> 02:10:08,062
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that that he was doing by covering it up, that was a lie.

1617
02:10:08,062 --> 02:10:16,029
[SPEAKER_03]: And that lie was far worse than blowing smoke up our ass because you got screwed over by a Chinese chip company, which is what happened to Tommy Tallarico.

1618
02:10:16,029 --> 02:10:20,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, not excusing Tommy's behavior and all of that.

1619
02:10:20,272 --> 02:10:21,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make that very clear.

1620
02:10:21,954 --> 02:10:25,376
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I kind of put the who sinned more,

1621
02:10:26,337 --> 02:10:28,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Bobby.

1622
02:10:28,778 --> 02:10:29,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Tommy lied.

1623
02:10:29,918 --> 02:10:32,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he really believed he would deliver what he said.

1624
02:10:32,459 --> 02:10:34,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would actually agree with that.

1625
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:38,461
[SPEAKER_05]: He always just seems to be a really sincere, earnest person.

1626
02:10:38,461 --> 02:10:39,882
[SPEAKER_05]: But foolish.

1627
02:10:39,882 --> 02:10:40,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but foolish.

1628
02:10:41,467 --> 02:10:43,809
[SPEAKER_03]: and YYR says I sit corrected.

1629
02:10:43,809 --> 02:10:44,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1630
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:45,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you would get it.

1631
02:10:45,651 --> 02:10:48,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's why I'm not yelling or raising my voice.

1632
02:10:48,193 --> 02:10:51,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just outlining.

1633
02:10:51,096 --> 02:10:57,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And SheHulk10 going back to the story on the protesters saying they are looking for low security opportunities to protest.

1634
02:10:57,241 --> 02:10:58,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're looking for it.

1635
02:10:58,322 --> 02:10:59,743
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking for those opportunities.

1636
02:10:59,743 --> 02:11:00,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them the opportunity.

1637
02:11:00,964 --> 02:11:03,627
[SPEAKER_05]: If one person exploits it, someone else is going to exploit it worse.

1638
02:11:03,627 --> 02:11:04,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1639
02:11:05,958 --> 02:11:14,740
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, hopefully, well, we know TwitchCon has some, Bobby was talking about the bag policy at TwitchCon, which I didn't even realize.

1640
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:21,342
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a super strict bag policy at TwitchCon, which, I mean, in light of what we are just talking about just now, good.

1641
02:11:21,342 --> 02:11:25,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm glad to hear that TwitchCon's taking safety seriously, so.

1642
02:11:25,203 --> 02:11:27,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Please stay away from the foam pits.

1643
02:11:27,403 --> 02:11:29,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, anybody that's going to TwitchCon, stay away from the foam pits.

1644
02:11:29,404 --> 02:11:32,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Crocs is having a pit.

1645
02:11:32,084 --> 02:11:34,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Crocs, the shoemakers, are gonna be there?

1646
02:11:34,165 --> 02:11:34,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1647
02:11:35,265 --> 02:11:35,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1648
02:11:35,866 --> 02:11:38,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many questions and not enough answers.

1649
02:11:38,948 --> 02:11:40,750
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I... They're comfortable.

1650
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:43,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in my mid-40s.

1651
02:11:43,032 --> 02:11:45,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Any sort of those physical challenges?

1652
02:11:45,914 --> 02:11:47,655
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1653
02:11:47,655 --> 02:11:50,117
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I am too damn old.

1654
02:11:50,117 --> 02:11:53,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think I want to do one this year.

1655
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:54,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

1656
02:11:54,281 --> 02:11:55,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to jowl.

1657
02:11:55,101 --> 02:11:57,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be cheering you down below.

1658
02:11:57,403 --> 02:12:01,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to practice my balance whenever I can.

1659
02:12:01,387 --> 02:12:03,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that I...

1660
02:12:04,743 --> 02:12:10,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put my training to use by knocking people off of a platform for prizes.

1661
02:12:10,405 --> 02:12:14,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you better feel around that pit to make sure it's foamy enough.

1662
02:12:14,446 --> 02:12:16,366
[SPEAKER_03]: If your back should hit it, just be careful.

1663
02:12:16,366 --> 02:12:18,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I just won't fall into it.

1664
02:12:18,247 --> 02:12:19,927
[SPEAKER_05]: She jumped off too, remember?

1665
02:12:19,927 --> 02:12:22,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, but still, still.

1666
02:12:22,728 --> 02:12:22,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1667
02:12:24,518 --> 02:12:25,919
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

1668
02:12:25,919 --> 02:12:36,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, SSU 100 Matt in chat says, Rob, I gotta ask, what did you think of the videos of the Swifties in the movie theater for the new heiress tour movie?

1669
02:12:36,026 --> 02:12:39,288
[SPEAKER_03]: NPR was calling it the new shadow cast movie.

1670
02:12:39,288 --> 02:12:40,109
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny.

1671
02:12:40,109 --> 02:12:49,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was hosting a show last night and, you know, at these shows in between acts, I often tell jokes and I don't write a lot of jokes in advance.

1672
02:12:49,356 --> 02:12:50,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't consider myself a joke writer.

1673
02:12:51,397 --> 02:12:56,202
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm definitely somebody who outlines bullet points and then I talk about stories, basically.

1674
02:12:56,202 --> 02:13:02,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, the theme of last night's event that we did was called The Silver Scream.

1675
02:13:02,768 --> 02:13:05,371
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Cabaret Macabre, The Silver Scream.

1676
02:13:05,371 --> 02:13:09,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually trying to pull up my Instagram stories real fast because I know not all of you are on Instagram.

1677
02:13:09,995 --> 02:13:15,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the performers at the event actually did a full on

1678
02:13:15,781 --> 02:13:18,143
[SPEAKER_03]: PyramidHead routine.

1679
02:13:18,143 --> 02:13:22,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking incredible because yes, it's a burlesque variety thing.

1680
02:13:22,285 --> 02:13:27,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have mostly women, but we also include non-binary and male performers as well.

1681
02:13:27,809 --> 02:13:31,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was a male performer who did a whole PyramidHead inspired act.

1682
02:13:31,991 --> 02:13:37,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that entire costume came off and I will let you theorize what was on underneath all of that.

1683
02:13:37,715 --> 02:13:42,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I'm just going to also shout out MistakenIdentity, the brand newest member

1684
02:13:42,678 --> 02:13:48,265
[SPEAKER_03]: for this routine with Michael Myers to TikTok by Kesha.

1685
02:13:48,265 --> 02:13:49,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so good.

1686
02:13:49,367 --> 02:13:53,111
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite part was she took off that whole thing.

1687
02:13:53,111 --> 02:13:58,038
[SPEAKER_03]: She took off that outfit and there was another outfit underneath.

1688
02:13:58,038 --> 02:13:59,640
[SPEAKER_03]: The same thing but bedazzled.

1689
02:14:01,193 --> 02:14:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: and OutfitReveal.

1690
02:14:22,221 --> 02:14:26,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was telling jokes because I was saying, hey, I know you all could be a lot of places tonight.

1691
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:31,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate that you spent your money here because I know you could have gone to see Taylor Swift, The Heiress Tour, right?

1692
02:14:31,890 --> 02:14:33,371
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because that movie is going on right now.

1693
02:14:33,371 --> 02:14:40,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, have you seen all that crazy shit on TikTok with all like the girls dancing in front of the stage in the circle and doing all these weird things?

1694
02:14:40,698 --> 02:14:43,020
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying it's like the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1695
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:46,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Rocky Horror Picture Show is a cult movie.

1696
02:14:46,163 --> 02:14:47,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Taylor Swift is just a cult.

1697
02:14:48,265 --> 02:14:49,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, don't get me wrong.

1698
02:14:49,746 --> 02:14:51,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Taylor Swift.

1699
02:14:51,327 --> 02:14:57,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I can respect a businesswoman who brings to the table huge, I-can-buy-and-sell-this-company energy.

1700
02:14:57,691 --> 02:15:03,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect the fact that Taylor Swift fucking hated the guy who owned her music so goddamn much.

1701
02:15:03,595 --> 02:15:04,796
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, you know what?

1702
02:15:04,796 --> 02:15:09,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna re-record all of my albums so I no longer have to pay you.

1703
02:15:10,672 --> 02:15:14,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a businesswoman, I fucking respect Taylor Swift.

1704
02:15:14,333 --> 02:15:15,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1705
02:15:15,253 --> 02:15:27,557
[SPEAKER_03]: That does not absolve her of this cult leader, Midsommar bullshit that I'm seeing in the theaters, which is a little bit, it's a little bit like Jesus camp to me.

1706
02:15:27,557 --> 02:15:28,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

1707
02:15:29,566 --> 02:15:43,925
[SPEAKER_03]: but I get big Jesus Camp vibes from it and I'm going to be staying away from the theater until I know those kids are in school and I can go watch that movie in the dark in peace by myself.

1708
02:15:43,925 --> 02:15:44,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1709
02:15:46,655 --> 02:15:49,857
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL in chat says, I watched the heiress tour in theaters.

1710
02:15:49,857 --> 02:15:50,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

1711
02:15:50,677 --> 02:15:50,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1712
02:15:50,958 --> 02:15:53,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I actually, I actually, there's a lot of Taylor Swift songs.

1713
02:15:53,999 --> 02:15:58,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like my favorite album by Taylor by Taylor.

1714
02:15:58,222 --> 02:16:00,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she's different.

1715
02:16:00,363 --> 02:16:04,905
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of albums of Taylor Swift that are like hit and miss for me.

1716
02:16:04,905 --> 02:16:09,148
[SPEAKER_03]: But like 1989 is like legit my favorite Taylor album.

1717
02:16:09,148 --> 02:16:13,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that she's rerecording that one next, I'm actually very interested in that.

1718
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:14,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So it should be interesting.

1719
02:16:16,432 --> 02:16:21,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't love the newer stuff quite as much.

1720
02:16:21,116 --> 02:16:27,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I would agree, Kylie Minogue is superior.

1721
02:16:27,062 --> 02:16:37,652
[SPEAKER_03]: But the energy to re-record around your former label owner is pretty, pretty good energy.

1722
02:16:37,652 --> 02:16:37,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1723
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:44,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwell says, I'm afraid if I play it in Blackwell theater, the Swifties will find my house and come dance.

1724
02:16:44,335 --> 02:16:48,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the other important note to at the end of the day.

1725
02:16:48,858 --> 02:16:56,922
[SPEAKER_03]: This exact same thing is going to happen with the Beyonce movie because of Beyonce is doing the exact same thing.

1726
02:16:56,922 --> 02:17:02,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will be the exact same thing with a very different crowd.

1727
02:17:02,145 --> 02:17:02,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1728
02:17:03,907 --> 02:17:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I see the Beyonce movie as well?

1729
02:17:06,688 --> 02:17:07,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1730
02:17:07,649 --> 02:17:09,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I feel similarly about Beyonce?

1731
02:17:09,690 --> 02:17:10,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, yeah.

1732
02:17:10,470 --> 02:17:13,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of her songs, I love some of her songs.

1733
02:17:13,332 --> 02:17:15,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I can kind of take it or leave it, to be honest, to be perfectly honest.

1734
02:17:15,953 --> 02:17:21,436
[SPEAKER_03]: But unlike Taylor Swift, I actually really dig Beyonce's newer albums.

1735
02:17:21,436 --> 02:17:29,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this last one that was a whole tribute to a New York City voguing scene of the 90s and all that stuff, I thought that album was actually fantastic.

1736
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:32,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to that movie for sure.

1737
02:17:34,331 --> 02:17:38,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this interesting that that's what now like movie theaters are, are these big tours?

1738
02:17:38,634 --> 02:17:44,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, to be honest, this new Madonna tour, I hope it gets a movie too.

1739
02:17:44,018 --> 02:17:44,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard of it?

1740
02:17:44,598 --> 02:17:47,700
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 40 songs in the new Madonna tour.

1741
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:49,161
[SPEAKER_05]: 40.

1742
02:17:49,161 --> 02:17:54,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just watch the one that she did in the 80s.

1743
02:17:54,585 --> 02:17:56,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Truth or Dare?

1744
02:17:56,006 --> 02:17:56,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That is.

1745
02:17:56,306 --> 02:17:56,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Truth or Dare.

1746
02:17:56,926 --> 02:17:57,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1747
02:17:57,727 --> 02:17:58,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, what's her name?

1748
02:18:01,323 --> 02:18:02,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I think of her name now?

1749
02:18:02,524 --> 02:18:04,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Julie Brown, not downtown.

1750
02:18:04,704 --> 02:18:05,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, as Medusa.

1751
02:18:05,765 --> 02:18:06,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Medusa.

1752
02:18:06,465 --> 02:18:07,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was hilarious.

1753
02:18:07,665 --> 02:18:08,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1754
02:18:08,345 --> 02:18:08,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1755
02:18:08,605 --> 02:18:10,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy Griffin's in that movie.

1756
02:18:10,286 --> 02:18:14,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very, very, yeah, older movie.

1757
02:18:14,267 --> 02:18:16,707
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was I going to say?

1758
02:18:16,707 --> 02:18:25,830
[SPEAKER_03]: If Madonna were to release her concert in new theaters, that would also be yet another very different crowd showing up to that in all of their walkers and canes.

1759
02:18:27,743 --> 02:18:31,887
[SPEAKER_03]: and I say that with all self-deprecation in mind.

1760
02:18:31,887 --> 02:18:38,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, with that, we're gonna wrap up the show tonight and move on out of here.

1761
02:18:38,773 --> 02:18:44,538
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I know you have a stream that you're gonna go do, some Dead by Daylight you were mentioning earlier.

1762
02:18:44,538 --> 02:18:48,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like you have an old friend coming back to the stream tonight to play.

1763
02:18:48,081 --> 02:18:48,522
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be fun.

1764
02:18:48,858 --> 02:18:49,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do.

1765
02:18:49,839 --> 02:18:55,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'll have to just double check and see if he's still down for but other than that, it's going to be trying to get more adept.

1766
02:18:55,802 --> 02:19:00,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I make the mad dash to the bathroom and back in time.

1767
02:19:00,764 --> 02:19:03,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will see everybody after TwitchCon.

1768
02:19:03,886 --> 02:19:11,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you find me at TwitchCon, be prepared to be interrogated for my vlog.

1769
02:19:11,010 --> 02:19:12,511
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have fun.

1770
02:19:12,511 --> 02:19:13,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good stream.

1771
02:19:13,471 --> 02:19:14,612
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see.

1772
02:19:14,612 --> 02:19:15,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you next week.

1773
02:19:15,732 --> 02:19:16,993
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of us will see you in two weeks.

1774
02:19:21,002 --> 02:19:25,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot the part where I say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1775
02:19:25,205 --> 02:19:29,249
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices out there to put out on air.

1776
02:19:29,249 --> 02:19:39,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word and nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify, or wherever it is you found this show it goes an awful long way and we appreciate it.

1777
02:19:39,398 --> 02:19:39,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1778
02:19:39,939 --> 02:19:40,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1779
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki with that your final thought.

1780
02:19:43,732 --> 02:19:49,496
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I'm going to be working on hopefully getting another episode out this week.

1781
02:19:49,496 --> 02:19:51,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1782
02:19:51,317 --> 02:19:53,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my final thought is I'm really sorry.

1783
02:19:53,018 --> 02:20:03,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I have fallen so far behind on my own streaming just between being actually sick two weeks ago, being side effects sick this last week, and just a lot going on in my day job.

1784
02:20:03,725 --> 02:20:04,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of stacked everything up.

1785
02:20:04,865 --> 02:20:06,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really had time to do VOG videos either.

1786
02:20:06,766 --> 02:20:07,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry.

1787
02:20:07,427 --> 02:20:09,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I also was hosting two shows this week.

1788
02:20:09,788 --> 02:20:10,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1789
02:20:10,209 --> 02:20:11,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't just host the show tonight or last night.

1790
02:20:12,730 --> 02:20:18,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to host a show at a museum on Thursday, a literal art museum, probably the biggest art museum in this area.

1791
02:20:18,533 --> 02:20:19,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to host a show.

1792
02:20:19,654 --> 02:20:20,955
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

1793
02:20:20,955 --> 02:20:26,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So my emceeing is officially a recognized work of art now.

1794
02:20:27,361 --> 02:20:28,883
[SPEAKER_03]: EgoInflate++.

1795
02:20:28,883 --> 02:20:29,463
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1796
02:20:29,463 --> 02:20:33,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, all kidding aside, I've been very grateful for every opportunity.

1797
02:20:33,447 --> 02:20:33,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1798
02:20:33,927 --> 02:20:34,888
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my final thought.

1799
02:20:34,888 --> 02:20:36,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm grateful for every opportunity.

1800
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:40,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm grateful for all of you that show up here and listen to the show every week.
