9805	16387	PSA to the United States, listeners, there's going to be a test of the emergency alert systems this Wednesday, October 4th at 11.20am Pacific.
16387	20549	This means that your and everyone else's phones is going to make that very attention-grabbing screech.
20549	23830	If you're listening to this after October 4th, sorry about your ears and heart rate.
23830	25411	This is the Public Awareness Intro.
25411	29632	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you about gaming news!
29632	33054	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
33054	34214	Oh.
34214	35394	And... Happy 25th, DDR!
40720	42741	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
42741	47822	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47822	54705	It is Orange Lounge Radio and thank you Jason for that lovely PSA at the top of the show.
54705	55625	It is a show.
55625	60747	Be careful if you're if you're deep into playing video games or MMOs or something and that alarm goes off.
61287	62968	don't say we didn't warn you here at OLR.
62968	65388	But anyway, hi, I'm Rob Roberts.
65388	75371	And we're here every week to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with all of you live at Twitch, and through you know, email and all that good stuff throughout the week.
75371	82113	I'm here with my co host, of course, every week, you know, save for a holiday week here and there, but back all night tonight.
82113	85714	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
85714	87475	Hey, everybody.
87475	88375	Hey, how are you doing?
89425	90585	I'm tired.
90585	92286	I hear that.
92286	94507	Oh, I'm because I'm stupid.
94507	96847	That's not a nice thing to say about yourself.
96847	98848	I can say what I want to about myself.
98848	100428	Yes, but I don't agree.
100428	101909	I do not agree.
101909	105950	Okay, so well, smart people can do stupid things.
105950	107710	Okay, so that is very true.
107710	109071	Yes.
109071	116053	So, so I met up with my friend Alicia for lunch as we say pie even if we don't get pie we go to Sherry's.
117208	120431	and Amazing Pumpkin Pancakes.
120431	128419	But anyway, I got home and I was like, oh shit, I haven't done any of my turnout exercises today.
128419	134585	Because, you know, I've got recital coming up in December and I'm really trying to step up my ballet game.
134585	137728	And so I did 20 minutes of barre right before we went live.
138421	140783	Oh, so you're probably pretty sore as well as tired.
140783	141504	Oh, no, I'm not.
141504	142545	I'm not sore.
142545	149050	Like, I mean, my my ankles are getting a little tight now from just, you know, chilling a bit.
149050	152573	But but no, my.
152573	157917	I'm just a little bit tired because I did like a hundred plies, a hundred eleves.
157917	161680	I did a hundred tendu en croix.
161680	163202	I did some grand battement.
163202	164663	I did a couple of arabesque.
164663	166605	I did lots of stretching and I did in 20 minutes.
169853	172555	Insert more French words here!
172555	176577	Yes, you do all those things so you can eat more macarons.
176577	177718	Anyway.
177718	178719	Possibly.
178719	184883	I don't know, but when I put it in my food tracker it says you get to eat 200 more calories today, unlike chocolate.
185133	187193	There you go, chocolate macaron.
187193	188354	This is this is weird.
188354	196196	So you know, you're talking about your ritual, one of your like ritual Sunday things and, and Alan, my husband has a ritual Sunday thing too.
196196	198096	He always does a Costco trip.
198096	204678	So as we are taping this live, he literally just sent me a message on our app that we chat on saying, you're doing the show.
204678	205838	So fuck my drag.
205838	207138	That's a literal quote.
207138	214840	But and then sends me this these pictures from Costco of this thing called a My Arcade by Atari, which I've never
215300	216982	I've not seen these before.
216982	221508	And this is not the same thing we talked about on the show recently, like Atari is doing their own thing.
221508	231160	But my arcade, who makes those little arcade machines that you've probably seen my collection of before, I guess they make a whole little flashback type of console.
231620	233721	So I've got my DVR one.
233721	234921	Oh, right, right.
234921	242303	So they've got this one, which it looks more like the new school kind of Atari than it does the woodgrain ones.
242303	244364	Yeah, but it's that's interesting.
244364	244684	I don't know.
244684	249946	So I kind of reply 80 bucks is still kind of pricey, but I still put kind of one.
249946	250226	I don't know.
250226	251206	Does anyone own one of those?
251206	253727	I'm curious if they're decent or what?
254661	257122	Let's see going to think we have that one.
257122	259623	But I think we've had like one of the early ones before.
259623	265425	Yeah, there's been at least like eight or nine probably this point flashback consoles, right, which is I think it's another developer.
265425	276669	But yeah, it's like Atari retro, you know, they've tapped that well time and time again, but I will say some of the taps are very effective, like the Atari 50 collections pretty, pretty doggone good.
277469	280452	I'm always a fan of course, you know I like the arcade one-up machines.
280452	285795	I know not every retro person is a fan because they don't like the different sizes, they don't like the modified screens.
285795	290819	But I think for what it is, you know what you're getting into, I think for what it is, it's a nice little modern take on that.
290819	293161	And I think they do a good job with the Atari retro stuff too.
293161	297484	And then of course that Atari thing we talked about a couple weeks ago on the show sounds pretty neat.
297484	301126	That actually plays the old cartridges if they'll still work.
301126	301787	That should be interesting.
302627	314198	I'm looking in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
314198	318221	Chatters over there are saying Dark Tatsuya says, I've heard of that new console.
318221	320083	PodCulture says, I really want that 2600.
320083	324006	NSG100 Matt says, huh, that's interesting.
324006	325267	Yeah, that's kind of my reaction too.
325267	326609	I had no idea that that was a thing.
327269	332414	Um, I just don't have a practical use for one given that I've got the systems.
332414	332854	That's true.
332854	340821	I feel like it's the type of thing I would play for like five minutes, like most things I spend that kind of money on, unfortunately, in video gaming, and then be like, let's go.
340821	343063	Like, I went to heaven for five minutes.
343063	344565	I was like, let's go.
344565	348708	That would be me with that Atari 2600 device, but I still kind of want it.
348708	353452	Maybe I could do some a video review for VOG and make
354820	356482	7 cents of that $70 back.
356482	356822	Just kidding.
356822	358364	We're not even monetized on YouTube yet.
358364	362387	More people need to watch us over at YouTube slash VOG Network, VOG Network.
362387	367392	Speaking of YouTube stars, say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki or LokiOLR.
367392	368012	Hello.
368012	370014	Hi, how are you?
370014	370575	I'm good.
370913	371593	Yeah, good.
371593	372974	Question mark.
372974	373775	I hope you are.
373775	375596	I hope things are fantastic for you.
375596	376237	That's fine.
376237	377657	In the Minecraft creation world.
377657	380639	I saw you started your new season, right?
380639	382621	Yeah, I finally put out an episode for it.
382621	388905	I started the season like a month ago, but you know, it doesn't really start until the rest of us can see it.
388905	389625	That's true.
389625	391647	That's true.
391647	394128	Some first person adventure gaming going on there.
394128	396050	Is that one of the Half-Life games?
396050	396710	I can't tell what that is.
397282	400663	No, no, it is a relatively new game, actually.
400663	402724	It is Ion Fury.
402724	406666	Oh, that's what they had to change from Ion Maiden, huh?
406666	408186	Yeah, exactly.
408186	413428	It was the one that they built in the Build 3D engine.
413428	415469	So the old Duke Nukem 3D engine.
415469	418290	That's why it looks like Duke Nukem 3D.
418290	419110	Got it.
419110	419991	OK, nice.
419991	421251	Yeah, I was going to say it's not.
421251	422972	I would recognize Duke Nukem 3D.
422972	424372	It's definitely not a level in that game.
424372	426253	But OK, Ion Maiden got it, or Ion
427029	427389	Storm.
427389	428490	Sorry, what did they end up calling?
428490	429590	I still call it Ion Maiden.
429590	431131	I know that's not what we're supposed to call it.
431131	432632	But yeah.
432632	433692	Anyway.
433692	436274	Game involving ions in the title.
436274	437314	Yes.
437314	439195	Ion named game.
439195	440976	Let's get into our show tonight.
440976	446459	So usually at the top of the show, we would get into a kickoff topic, one of the big stories for the week.
446459	448480	We are going to do that in a moment.
448480	454683	But it was brought to my attention that we actually passed a pretty big landmark this week that, frankly, I was unaware of.
455763	464549	And so I want to talk a little bit about this little game that I know I used to play an awful lot of, as did DarkSakura, as did Loki.
464549	471473	And maybe once in a while we'll dabble in this game, and I know some of you out there still play this game an awful lot.
471473	476957	I am, of course, talking about the game that brought us all together, that started Orange Lawns Radio, Dance Dance Revolution.
477717	485586	And believe it or not, DDR, as of course we've called it over the years, turned 25 this week.
485586	489571	That's right, DDR is 25 years old.
489571	496679	I didn't realize this because it doesn't quite feel like 25 to us because of course we didn't get it in America for a little while.
497799	502462	But, I mean, and, you know, nuances around when would you consider the official launch?
502462	503663	Was it USA Mix?
503663	506064	Was it when the first machine was imported over here?
506064	509085	I mean, there's a lot of ways you could kind of, you know, measure that.
509085	519091	But, officially, the arcade version of DDR 1.0, you know, Aye Aye Aye, Butterfly, Paranoia, all those songs from the original DDR,
519851	522273	September 26th, 1998.
522273	530240	And of course, you would remember the year if you play DDR over the years, they actually had a song called 1998.
530240	533723	At one point, it was a reference to the year that DDR actually came out.
533723	541870	And of course, believe it or not, 1998 was 25 years ago, however old that might make you feel to hear that.
541870	544352	So yeah, this game that brought us all together, because again,
545425	556991	I know I tell this story once in a while, but for our new listeners that may be out there, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki all met through the community behind this game.
556991	562673	There was a very large internet-based community before there was Twitter, before there was Facebook even.
562673	565415	There was a very large community called DDRFreak.
566255	576850	and myself and DarkSakura and Loki were all posters on that forum at one time or another and we all were local to Sacramento and we would all meet up.
576850	578072	And I got made a mod.
578072	578893	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
578893	579934	You were a mod at one point.
579934	582979	I got a flashy foot eventually thanks to OLR because we ended up
583799	585480	It's interesting how things came full circle.
585480	593022	We ended up with the privilege of debuting songs from Ultramix 4 here on this program years later.
593022	599745	I know it may not feel like it now all these years later, but in the early years of OLR, if you go back to Episode 1, Episode 2,
600545	605146	through about episode 108, I think it was 168, actually, was the crossover number.
605146	608447	And you can find those episodes if you know where to look.
608447	609687	Just remember, they're dated.
609687	614348	But all those episodes, we really talked at length about the DDR community.
614348	617429	Now, granted, you know, how do you fill three hours talking about DDR?
617429	621250	Well, you know, just like there's on this show now, there's many tangents.
621250	624511	You would still have, you know, other types of music games.
624511	630472	I would still say things in the later years, like Guitar Hero, you know, other music games that were
630572	631193	RedOctane
645874	650316	So it's interesting how DDR has really come full circle in a lot of ways.
650316	654018	But obviously I have to take a moment to acknowledge this game that started it all.
654018	660881	Without this game, I would not know DarkSakura, Loki, or probably any of you, quite frankly.
660881	663983	Certainly as well as we know each other now, thanks to Orange Lounge Radio.
663983	668845	And yes, Orange Lounge was the name of one of the bands in later DDR.
668845	673367	So like an ABBA tribute band might call themselves Mamma Mia,
673587	674228	Orange Lounge Radio
692622	707001	you know, where the show was born from of this game that now 25 years on, interestingly enough, feels like it's in a, I don't know if I would say Renaissance, or more like a second life, a second mix, if you will, truly like a DDR second mix.
707001	707742	I'm going to call it that.
708463	712626	of what's been happening in this like round one era, right?
712626	724374	Because like, you know, when we were at our prime in DDR in the show's early days, if we wanted to play import games, that involved us really looking around for them, right?
724374	736083	Like sometimes we might have to go to some of the golf lands in South Bay, had some import machines, or you might, I want to say for a short time, there was some in San Francisco, but usually it involved us driving to LA.
736503	751663	We had to either go to Koreatown, or the Japan Center that's there in LA, or the legendary Arcade Infinity, which I'm sure many of you have heard about from its fighting game roots, that was also a huge hotbed for music games and import and all that.
753515	754536	R.I.P.
754536	756377	and they also sold import cars.
771285	772706	Yeah, it is fascinating.
772706	780908	Orange Lounge Radio and DDR Freak Radio kind of started around the same time, and they were actually independent thoughts of each other.
780908	787351	Because at the time, I mean, I don't know how far down this road I want to go, but it's the past to me now.
787351	790912	But at the time, the moderator that started DDR Freak and I weren't speaking.
791452	797237	And so we would have had no clue that we were thinking of somewhat similar ideas.
797237	800880	Obviously they were deviating quite a bit.
800880	803963	Jamie, you had this interesting position where you got to walk the line of both those things.
805887	814138	But time passed and we came to a point where we ended up getting simulcast on DDR Freak Radio, we ended up kind of helping each other out.
814138	820766	And then like they actually contributed programming to us, I want to say at one point, we did like a countdown show in cahoots with them and so forth.
820766	821788	So, um,
822248	833520	Yeah, it's, it's, you know, a lot of the collaborations we've been able to do over the years have really opened us up to more audiences, whether it's DDR Freak Radio, or, you know, through the years we were on All Games Radio, we met a lot of new faces and so forth.
833520	836884	So it's all been, you know, networking is a great thing.
836884	837344	It sure is.
839433	851981	DJRamaS in our chat, who I know also played DDR back in the back in the day, said it's interesting that Taku and Naoki Madeya haven't said anything about 25 years of DDR.
851981	854583	Well, I think I think very similar.
854583	855223	It's Mida.
857064	857564	Rob.
857564	859306	Oh, I just think I know.
859306	860106	I always think of that.
860106	861387	Yeah, I know.
861387	864249	And I always say something.
864249	869913	But I did get to meet him once, and he does dress just as fashionably as you would imagine.
869913	872215	Just putting that out there.
872215	883063	I was going to say they're no longer employees of Konami, and I'm assuming those are not fond memories in the past, very similar to what Hideo Kojima is looking back in the memories.
883387	885288	Konami knows how to burn those bridges.
885288	887309	Yeah, Konami definitely knows how to burn those bridges.
887309	901757	Plus, Naoki is now doing, like, again, you want to talk about second mix, is doing spiritual successor music in Step Maniacs, which is, it's interesting because DDR and Konami machines exist.
901757	909181	But then, of course, you have Step Maniacs, which also exists as another sort of evolution in a different way, just of a different mind.
909181	909581	And, you know,
909981	919572	It's as if DDR, you know, back in the extreme days would have just kept going in the extreme way and not like in all the other weird ways that they went.
919572	919773	Yeah.
920350	940368	But it's really cool to see a lot of the musical spiritual successors in the Step Maniacs because, you know, they've been very good about getting licenses from the old DDR games or like more contemporary songs from the same artists or even throwback songs from the same artists like E-Rotic, you know, was, you would know that even if you
940828	942170	Our lap giggling at the name.
942170	954125	Yes, that was actually the name of a band in DDR because it was the name of a band that was on the Dance Maniacs CD music collection in Japan, where all the music licenses came from.
954125	955046	Some more of their music.
955046	956808	I still have stuff of theirs in my playlist.
956808	957269	Oh, yeah.
957269	957529	Yeah.
957529	958030	No, those dance
958130	959911	Mostly the ABBA covers.
959911	966096	Those that is like the actually specifically the erotic Megamix album, which you could find on YouTube.
966096	971100	I mean, you find anything on YouTube these days is actually still like a bop to listen to.
971100	973442	But it's it's it's Euro trash.
973442	974743	That's the genre I would put.
974743	976324	It is absolute Euro trash.
976324	977345	But you know what?
977345	981489	I would say Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is also trash television.
981489	983570	That doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching it once in a while.
984951	986352	It's what it is.
986352	988893	Sometimes there's that trash music we like to listen to.
988893	1001537	So anyway, I don't know where I was going with all that, but I felt we needed to kind of just tip our hat and nod to this game that turned 25 years old that really brought us together, DDR.
1001537	1007460	Loki, DarkSakura, I know I've been kind of dominating the conversation, but is there anything you want to say about DDR, DDR memories?
1007460	1008440	Oh, man, it was huge.
1008440	1011701	Like, it was absolutely huge in just our lives.
1011701	1013122	I mean, we played
1014022	1015523	We've done a show about it.
1015523	1016644	We've played it.
1016644	1017424	I own it.
1017424	1019706	Like, it's just.
1019706	1024509	Yeah, I mean, it's still just earlier this week, I was listening to a song on Spotify.
1024509	1031893	I'm like, you know, that sounds like a DDR song, something that they should probably have in there, like, you know, Step Maniacs, I guess, at this point.
1031893	1035175	But yeah, I think it's pretty cool.
1035175	1035976	Yeah.
1035976	1038137	Many of our I mean, go ahead.
1038137	1038237	Hmm.
1039052	1045814	Oh, I was just saying, you know, I remember getting really good balance trying not to slip on my Dreamcast, you know.
1045814	1060558	I have a really good memory of coming home and seeing a dance pad laid out with a big Dreamcast logo on it and seeing Second Mix on my TV.
1060558	1064199	And just going, oh, I have a good hubby.
1064199	1066440	Well, not hubby at the time, but I knew he was a keeper.
1068994	1075717	and going to your place and bringing over the original Disney mix and third mix and fourth mix.
1075717	1082820	Yeah, because I had that really crappy dance pad from the Jungle Book game on PlayStation 1 that you could actually use as a DDR mat.
1082820	1087823	It worked for both, but it was it was for a child, so it was a lot smaller.
1087823	1088943	But I got the job and I lived.
1088943	1089884	We were mentally there.
1089884	1090864	Yeah, I lived it.
1090864	1095286	I lived in an upstairs apartment at the time, which also was really funny in retrospect.
1095286	1096447	So yeah.
1097307	1113165	But yeah, I was gonna say, because Loki you were talking about, you know, just how much DDR is, you know, impacted and, and we in in some sorts of ways have impacted DDR as well, you know, like I said, we got to do some of the previews of songs here on this show, you know, and talk to some of the people and
1113705	1139607	a lot of our friends and well not a lot but you know relatively our friends and peers of the DDR freak era several of them worked on the games you know especially the xbox series although some of the other stuff too so it's it's interesting how the fans sort of ultimately impacted the franchise i got to play supernova in front of naoki that's that's right you were you were the first person outside konami to play ddr supernova i was there i saw it so
1140214	1142697	DVR Association got us on TV playing Early Guitar Freaks at my house.
1155664	1159166	and also taught me how to how to actually hold drumsticks properly.
1159166	1164648	Well, not DDR, but leading to drum mania, you know, leading up to the other games.
1164648	1169410	I I learned a lot and I overcame a little bit of my fear of being in public.
1169410	1181395	I mean, there's a small, tiny part of me that even thinks I might not be doing ballet today if it wasn't for learning how to love moving.
1181395	1182035	Make sense?
1182035	1183276	Yeah, no, for sure.
1183276	1183616	For sure.
1184609	1189957	Yeah, it's interesting the impact this this silly little game with its silly music has had on our lives.
1189957	1199251	But yeah, it's, you know, and as I was kind of referencing, now it's interesting to see that there's a second, a true second mix generation coming up because of round one.
1199711	1206954	because of, you know, now that DDR machines, especially, you know, the newer mixes and so forth are a lot easier to find, right?
1206954	1213657	Because a lot of big cities have round one or there's other ways, you know, Konami has kind of embraced the U.S.
1213657	1220240	distribution a lot more than they did in the past, where I think they more kind of just turned an eye to it where they weren't really watching it.
1220240	1220440	But
1221180	1222481	You know, a lot can be said about that era.
1222481	1228547	But you know, obviously DDR is it's weird to say it's a renaissance, but it's it's really is like a second coming of that era.
1228547	1235354	And now it's funny because there's these podcasts that exist to talk about DDR.
1235354	1239518	And I guarantee you the folks doing this, those shows never heard of this show.
1239518	1240218	And that's fine.
1240218	1241119	Of course not.
1241119	1241620	That's fine.
1241940	1255925	you know, there were probably too old for them to, you know, and again, we moved on from that era at some point, you know, because unfortunately, there were a few dark years in there where Konami was look like they were just going to kill the franchise and never do another one.
1255925	1265088	So I think that's what what makes this whole like second mix and second revival of DDR coming back for its 25th anniversary.
1265088	1269370	All that more sweeter, but it's just a bummer that my body's gotten slower.
1270130	1291915	over the years but I still can't resist you know if I if I see one I do like I do like to get on and play maybe like trick level songs I don't think I do the absolute wild stuff anymore but I'll do no I can't yeah I was just well because I'm way out of shape I need I need to get back into it but yeah it's you have to like really go back to
1293385	1306069	you know, we're talking old school ratings because I still can't take the new ratings and put them back into like the pre, I don't even know when they switched to like 20.
1306069	1311011	But going back to like extreme ratings, you know, I can't do that translation.
1311011	1318734	But for for me, since I'm playing extreme, it would be like a four or five footer song on singles, not doubles.
1318734	1319314	So it's like
1320335	1324680	You really have to go back to like the beginning like you haven't played before.
1324680	1326802	Because it's rough.
1326802	1341037	It's also interesting now because as much as I don't give a hoot what other people think, I'm also acutely aware that if I do play a DDR machine at round one or something like people are going to be like, what's this old ass man doing playing this game?
1341037	1341998	You know, and it's it's
1343240	1345821	It's it does start to make you feel a little self conscious.
1345821	1354805	So like, I don't think anyone really cares about that anyway, especially the people playing it probably like, Oh, hey, I recognize them, you know, like, because yeah, DDR grandpa's up on the machine again.
1354805	1361207	No, it's not that I but you know, I don't I don't want to go when all the people that are showing off are doing their thing.
1361207	1364969	So it's like, you know, I like to I like to find the DDR machine that's in the corner somewhere.
1364969	1367410	I don't even really like to play the new new DDR machines.
1367410	1371492	I like to go find like a DDR Max 2 machine and play Jerry Halliwell or something.
1371492	1371952	Good luck.
1372332	1374372	I know, I know, they're really hard to find anymore.
1374372	1383594	The oldest machine I could find around here is probably, it's a Supernova or a Supernova 2, and it's at that John's Incredible Pizza.
1383594	1384234	Oh, wow.
1384234	1386555	That's like the oldest machine I've seen.
1386555	1391836	We don't live where there's Max and Max 2s and 4th Mix or anything like that.
1391836	1393436	I see them when traveling.
1393436	1394757	I don't see them here locally.
1394757	1400178	It's more traveling, because even more so, I will give less of a hoot what other people think when I'm in another city.
1402619	1402919	Rico's
1414190	1416492	That place has been legendary locally here for years.
1416492	1417652	Are they finally retiring?
1417652	1418713	Is that why they're going out of business?
1418713	1420054	I hope it's a good reason.
1420054	1431061	I have no idea, but I very much think it'd be worthwhile to, you know, see if they still have a machine there and to give it a send off.
1431061	1431641	One last try.
1431641	1437325	Remember when the only Max2 machine in town was at a Giovanni's Pizza, the New York style pizza place?
1439048	1441309	Actually, their pizza was... That place was yummy.
1441309	1442769	That place was bomb.
1442769	1445390	And yeah, they were the only place in town with a Max2 machine.
1445390	1447430	Wonder what happened to all those machines.
1447430	1451992	Like, I mean, I'm sure a lot of individuals own them now, but like... They're in school's garages rotting away.
1451992	1453952	Yeah.
1453952	1462754	I mean, you know, the Mels, our dear friends of the show here, owned the Parapara machine that used to be at Arcade Infinity all those years ago.
1462754	1466596	So like, they end up with private collectors one way or the other.
1466596	1467536	Yeah.
1467536	1467936	All right.
1467936	1468216	Anyhow.
1468514	1471583	DarkSakuraNews had to build Dance Maniacs.
1471583	1472024	What's that?
1472024	1472245	Loki.
1475520	1477221	And Loki was building one, right?
1477221	1477721	For a moment?
1477721	1478882	I wanted to, yeah.
1478882	1489709	I bought sensors and stuff, and I had a whole plan with my candy cab that I was gonna make, like, all the different Bomani machines out of it and stuff, and I had, like, parts and things I had acquired from all that.
1489709	1495893	It was supposed to be, like, a way to, like, have DDR at home, but then when I got DDR at home, I was like, ah, yeah, I'm not gonna do that stuff anymore.
1495893	1501337	Also, the monitor broke, so I have to fix that first on the candy cab before I do anything.
1502017	1503979	But yeah, Dance Maniacs is fun for a while.
1503979	1508962	I think if I actually had a Dance Maniacs machine, I'd probably get tired of it eventually.
1508962	1513365	Only because they don't have a way to do Step Mania stuff in there.
1513365	1520971	Although, I'm sure you could probably do it, make something like that, which would be really sweet.
1520971	1524874	But yeah, I'd be curious to see where all those old machines are, though.
1524874	1529818	Because I'm sure some private collectors have them, but I can't be all private collectors.
1530488	1546383	I mean, probably lots of in the groove machines out there, I guess, old old machines, arcades and things like that, just places you wouldn't think to bowling alleys, you know, in rural America, just, you know, where you yeah, even bowling alleys nowadays, like it's all ticket machines.
1546383	1548185	It's like you can go to arc.
1548185	1552148	I like I go to arcades like I was just at arcade yesterday.
1553687	1557948	And it's always the same machines now.
1557948	1563989	I was surprised because some of the stuff I saw, they had a course like Fruit Ninja on a touch screen.
1563989	1565289	I was like, why?
1565289	1567130	And then I saw Infinity Blade EX.
1567130	1569710	I'm like, that was a free demo.
1569710	1571711	Who's making an arcade game out of that?
1571711	1576432	You can get all of those assets for free on the Epic Games Store.
1576432	1577612	What is the point?
1579725	1584767	But it was a thing, you know, I went to Scandia because we want to play mini golf.
1584767	1586468	But there's no DDR there.
1586468	1592030	It's just all ticket games and it's all ticket games.
1592030	1594571	They have the usual games you see there.
1594571	1599973	You know, there's like the Nerf gun game, which is kind of lame.
1599973	1605175	You know, it's just a few pinball machines, stuff like that.
1605175	1609237	But it's it's there's not a lot of dance games out there nowadays.
1610602	1614084	All right, well, we're gonna move on with the show.
1614084	1619326	We could spend three hours reminiscing on DDR, but we do want to get into this week's news and so forth.
1619326	1620606	So let's get to it.
1620606	1624148	Let's talk about now 25 years later what the big headlines are.
1624148	1626329	Let's talk about the big headline of the week.
1626329	1627649	Loki, why don't I kick it over to you?
1627649	1630831	I mean, this really could be any year because this has happened.
1630831	1633332	This isn't the first time it's happened.
1633332	1635913	It's like at least the second time it's happened recently.
1635913	1636093	So
1637734	1638375	I mean, I don't know.
1638375	1652947	So another hacking group has claimed that they have compromised all of Sony's systems, saying that we won't, we're not ransoming the data, we will sell the data due to Sony not wanting to pay.
1652947	1655349	Data is for sale, we are selling it.
1655349	1658692	According to... So they're not ransoming the data, but they're holding it...
1659438	1660819	That's ransoming the data.
1660819	1666684	No, I mean they were ransoming the data and somebody said we're not paying the ransom, so now they're selling the data.
1666684	1674050	So that'd be like if I kidnap a child, they don't want the child back, and so now I have to sell the child to somebody else.
1674050	1676192	What a horrible analogy, but thank you.
1676192	1678173	Yeah, that's how I've been better with a cat or a dog.
1678173	1683878	I'd look at it more as that they have a better opportunity to make some sort of profit instead.
1684520	1685420	I guess, yeah.
1685420	1700583	So apparently, according to Australian cybersecurity publication Cybersecurity Connect, they had reported that the group has allegedly unearthed screenshots of Sony's internal login pages.
1700583	1711105	They provided them an internal PowerPoint presentation outlining test bench details and several Java files, as well as a documentary of the entire leak housing 6,000 files.
1712445	1716746	So that's the proof that they built, that basically provided them.
1716746	1723408	Within those 6000 files is different documentation, build logs, HTML data.
1723408	1727269	I'm not really sure what necessarily that means as far as like games.
1727269	1731710	I don't think we're talking like source code or anything here.
1731710	1738172	I'm sorry to barge in, but I have some late breaking news and I need to mention this before I drop it.
1738172	1739993	But somebody just got back from Costco.
1741674	1750536	And if you can't see my webcam, I'm holding up a box with the Atari retro video game system that I spoke about earlier in the program.
1751520	1752661	is now in my hands.
1752661	1753401	So there's that.
1753401	1766146	So we'll be we'll be doing a video or two on that pretty I did not realize now what I did not realize is that it's not just 2600 it's 5200 7800 arcade and other other crap too.
1766146	1767347	So that's pretty exciting.
1767347	1771128	So anyway, and bonus game bonus games.
1771128	1775790	Thank you to the amazing Alan Alchemy for picking that up.
1775790	1778231	And he said I'm taking it out of your mortgage check.
1780012	1783035	Anyway, sorry, Loki, but important update.
1783035	1786858	No, absolutely understandable.
1786858	1791602	Basically, Sony has told IGN that they're currently looking into the claims.
1791602	1793423	We're investigating the situation.
1793423	1794824	We have no further comment.
1794824	1795165	Of course.
1797417	1812289	Yeah, so apparently this ransomware operator and ransomware as a service organization, ransom.vc, they have, I guess they operate out of Ukraine or Russia.
1812289	1825740	And they've also reportedly worked with EU's General Data Protection and GDPR and other data privacy laws to report vulnerabilities with companies.
1825740	1826621	So they've
1827438	1831762	They were doing white hat hacking, but then they also were stealing stuff?
1831762	1835906	That doesn't make any sense.
1835906	1836846	All right, well, cool.
1836846	1843592	Weird leaks, because that's really what I'm here for, is I just want to know, like, what games and movies and stuff is Sony hiding from us?
1844440	1848681	I mean, I guess that's really why not come full circle after Xbox.
1848681	1853182	But now here's the problem with the Xbox stuff that happened last week.
1853182	1856803	If you all were here for that, there was a lot of stuff that leaked from Microsoft.
1856803	1858284	That was Microsoft's fault.
1858284	1860264	They uploaded unredacted documents.
1860264	1870627	You know, they oops, they dragged and dropped the wrong folder into, you know, so there was really not an ethical question about if it's OK to talk about that stuff because Microsoft screwed up.
1870627	1870747	It's
1871107	1875593	It sucks for them, but nobody stole anything in that case.
1875593	1884504	Now in this case, it's it's not really the same thing because however you want to sugarcoat it, this stuff was stolen.
1884504	1887508	And it's it's gonna get I'm like, let me tell you.
1888421	1893804	go back and listen to everything I was saying about headlines on blogs and everything.
1893804	1897866	There is no ethic questions that are going to be asked by those folks.
1897866	1899447	Like it's not going to happen.
1899447	1903029	So this news is going to leak out because people want those clicks.
1903029	1904729	YouTubers want those views, right?
1904729	1907431	Like it's, it's gonna happen.
1907431	1913034	So it's just, you know, it's a matter of when it actually comes out.
1913034	1915455	If somebody doesn't buy it to suppress it, which is
1915866	1923289	Or if Sody knows what the data is, so if they're talking like build logs, like... Okay, cool, you have build logs.
1924460	1925561	Yeah, so what?
1925561	1928103	Like, we don't care.
1928103	1930404	Like, like, who needs that?
1930404	1935688	It may just not be interesting, like Java files, like.
1935688	1940551	Well, what about people's logins, like the great PS3 hack and all this stuff where.
1940551	1950638	It doesn't even say that they have that, though, like they just have like a screenshot of the internal login page and internal PowerPoint presentation talking about test bench details.
1951294	1956190	Like, ooh boy, now you're gonna reveal what test benches they run to test stuff.
1956568	1957089	I see.
1957089	1962933	So this may not be as much of a fire.
1962933	1968338	I mean, it's a dumpster fire, but it's not the smoking, you know, hot stuff you want to see.
1968338	1970119	Well, Sony's not saying anything about it.
1970119	1972201	And of course, the group is going to hype it up.
1972201	1973382	They're going to make it sound like that.
1973382	1976704	They have something big because they want somebody to pay for it.
1976704	1977545	Right.
1977545	1981368	I just I'm wondering if it's just it's a nothing burger.
1981368	1983450	So we'll see.
1983450	1984571	Let's time let it leak out.
1984831	1989794	Let's go to some comments from chat because chatter is giving a lot of insight over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1989794	1997619	SheHulk10 says they should pay to protect their customers since they don't invest in their IT and still prosecute as well.
1997619	1998560	Yeah.
1998560	1998860	Yes.
1998860	2002122	Do what a whole wasn't that the setup of the Mel Gibson movie?
2002122	2004824	I'm going to pay the ransom but then I'm going to go shoot the person.
2004824	2005885	I don't know.
2005885	2006465	Maybe I'm mixing.
2006465	2007746	Was it Liam Neeson?
2007746	2008026	I don't know.
2008026	2008606	Who cares?
2008606	2012489	Anyway, SEO 100 Matt says so last time this happened with PlayStation 3,
2013109	2016250	They gave folks, what, a free game and PlayStation Plus.
2016250	2020931	What are they giving folks now in the inevitable class action lawsuit?
2020931	2025753	QuestBuster says there was also another individual that allegedly leaked the dump for free.
2025753	2031874	And for what they listed, it apparently doesn't have anything related to film or games, but it did have information.
2031874	2037196	It did have items like information on certificates, policies, and a license generator.
2037196	2038636	And Bobby follows that up too.
2038636	2040397	Most of the data is probably unremarkable.
2040737	2043678	They accessed the analogy to the company's Google Drive.
2043678	2045279	They didn't store customer data there.
2045279	2047860	It's more internal documentation between teams.
2047860	2055102	So it sounds like it's kind of like one technical step, maybe under what we saw from the Microsoft data leak in some regards.
2055102	2064525	So those certificates and the things you're talking about, that would have nothing to do about bypassing customer security and like security certificates, right?
2064525	2066766	We're talking more about like game certification process.
2067256	2067956	right?
2067956	2069437	Just to make sure I don't know.
2069437	2069857	Right?
2069857	2072098	Because those are two different things, right?
2072098	2079620	And if they somehow make it easier to spoof and fake users, well, that could still be a big deal even without specific names and passwords and information.
2079620	2082161	But we're talking about like game certification process and stuff.
2082161	2086062	Yeah, it's probably gonna be more on the unremarkable license.
2086442	2094767	Generator was like for generating, you know, key pairs so that you could basically put third party like software onto a PlayStation.
2094767	2100130	Like that would be enormous, like even if it's not dev stuff, but I doubt it.
2100130	2100570	It's that.
2102724	2115309	Well, I imagine more will develop on this in the coming weeks because one way or another this information is probably going to get out unless somebody unless somebody at Sony or well connected to them ends up buying it and suppressing it.
2115309	2118591	But I feel like even when that happens, people tend to leak it out anyway.
2118591	2121972	Like you, you can't trust a crook like this.
2121972	2122072	It's
2124786	2125747	It's I don't know.
2125747	2126827	Anyway.
2126827	2127768	All right.
2127768	2134012	Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have been playing this week on Sony platforms or otherwise.
2134012	2135613	How was your gaming week?
2135613	2137454	And we'll go to DarkSakura first.
2137454	2141437	How was your gaming week?
2141437	2141977	Hi.
2141977	2145159	Oh, hi.
2145159	2145799	Hi.
2145799	2146040	Hi.
2146040	2146580	How was your game?
2146580	2147180	It's working.
2147180	2148581	Yeah.
2148581	2148861	Sorry.
2148861	2148881	I
2150253	2152295	I've been having some weird lag, sorry.
2152295	2152975	Yeah, that's okay.
2152975	2154897	We're hearing a little bit of a robot effect.
2154897	2156218	My week was pretty okay.
2156218	2166826	I thought I was going to beat Live Alive last night and no, I instead was trying... I must have heard you like way later.
2166826	2168307	You did.
2168307	2168948	Okay.
2168948	2170269	Am I in real time now?
2170269	2171510	I think so.
2171510	2171950	Keep going.
2174792	2186736	Okay, so anyway, I thought I was going to beat Live Alive last night and instead what happened is I was going after everybody's best weapon and I have one more to go.
2186736	2188797	And then hopefully I can beat the game.
2188797	2190158	I mean, I like the game.
2190158	2193599	I'm having a good time, but I'm kind of ready to be done.
2193599	2198140	Played some Disney Dreamlight Valley, played some Dead by Daylight.
2198140	2201021	I'm doing the thing, Rob.
2201021	2201982	I'm working on Nurse.
2203187	2204090	Oh, fun.
2204090	2208164	I mean, it's if you practice, practice, practice, hear me cry and scream.
2209252	2214355	Well, the thing is, I mean, I am using Plaid Flannel, so I know where I'm going.
2214355	2219217	But, like, I did some just, like, instinctive blinks and got people.
2219217	2221719	So I think I can get there.
2221719	2226681	I think it's like something clicked and the blinking is kind of making a bit more sense.
2226681	2232664	But I was easing myself into it by using the matchbox, which gives her 4.4 movement speed.
2234325	2240106	So just sort of like normal killer speed, but faster than survivors, but with only one blink.
2240106	2244327	And I think I just, if I'm going to do it, I'm just going to, I need to learn to blink.
2244327	2244627	Yes.
2244627	2247427	End of story.
2247427	2251588	So there's, there's that.
2251588	2256169	I got my, I'm slowly just working my way through things.
2256169	2262390	There are, I think they've expired, but if not, they're expiring tomorrow on Monday.
2263270	2267031	So there are two blood point codes.
2267031	2270872	One is Danka in German for thank you.
2270872	2276094	And the other one is Kamsahamnida, which is Korean thank you.
2276094	2279215	And I have them up on my Twitter if anyone wants to know how to spell it.
2279215	2281976	So both of those are 200 blood points a pop.
2281976	2284377	I need to redeem those because Alan sent me the codes yesterday.
2284377	2286337	Sorry, 200,000 blood points a pop.
2286337	2288138	I've played so little DVD lately, though.
2290575	2293838	I'm still enjoying it.
2293838	2308470	And I'm actually putting some work into the... Well, I haven't updated my Mac to Sonoma yet because I have to wait and see if OBS will work.
2308470	2313754	I think that the beta of OBS is going to work fine with it, but I'm still waiting a little bit.
2313754	2317437	But what I want to do next is experiment with the game porting kit.
2319457	2326999	and see if I can't get the emulation working through the game dev kit to actually play native.
2326999	2332380	Because if you've seen what some of these games look like... Oh my goodness.
2332380	2336101	Oh my goodness.
2336101	2343663	The videos that I linked to Loki earlier were all tested on an M1 Pro, and I just have an M1 Mac Mini.
2345324	2363880	But even so, Cyberpunk looked gorgeous, Horizon Zero Dawn, they tested it with RE2, they tested it with all kinds of stuff, and they're looking really good, and I figured something as not intensive as Dead by Daylight, that's gotta be decent enough for me to test it with, so I'm gonna...
2365845	2387653	It's up there, and I'm thinking what I might do is just do a full backup of my system, wipe everything, reinstall all my streaming tools, and, you know, my Final Cut, my Logic, and all that stuff, and see if I can try it myself, and see if I can learn to port games for friends.
2387653	2392054	So that would be fun.
2392054	2392335	And then...
2395653	2406299	I did a ballet and I'm actually, right now, finding the thing that I need for my new Julie cosplay at Twitter.
2406299	2408400	You mean TwitchCon?
2408400	2411062	That is not how you spell my name, Philof9, but thank you.
2413463	2413784	TwitchCon 2021
2433585	2436547	Well, um, I'm fixing up my pig cosplay.
2436547	2442352	I just have to reinforce the inside of the crown so that it actually will stay upright when I'm wearing it.
2442352	2450879	Um, you know, and I'm also bringing the second version of the pig cosplay, which is basically me taking off that heavy-ass, you know, crown and mask and
2452300	2457425	I'll go ahead and spoil it.
2457425	2466294	If I don't do the plaid Julie Legion outfit, I'm going to do the new Skabon outfit, the delinquent schoolgirl.
2468230	2473774	It's interesting with the pig stuff, there's a new Saw movie that just came out with that character in it.
2473774	2477658	I don't follow those movies super closely.
2477658	2479379	She hasn't been in one in a while, right?
2479379	2481721	Didn't they kill her off in one of them?
2481721	2485344	I mean, spoiler alert, but not that I really care about those movies anyway.
2485344	2489948	I don't watch the movies, but I've just read all the stuff about it and watched a few scenes here and there.
2489948	2493450	The reviews are getting the highest score that the series has gotten since the original.
2513058	2528543	it's it's fascinating to me that it's 10 movies in and it's still going you know it's something else so anyway um okay uh if that is it for your gaming week we will trot on over to Loki
2530269	2532011	I just played Minecraft.
2532011	2537318	I've got my episode 1 done for season 3, which is pretty cool.
2537318	2543006	And then I've been just working on different things for the next episode and getting stuff done for that.
2543006	2547532	I filmed some stuff earlier today for that and built a farm.
2548290	2550231	And there are a lot more farms.
2550231	2554792	I have my starter build already designed, so I just have to gather materials and then build that.
2554792	2557793	And that's probably going to be in the next episode as well.
2557793	2563934	So I'm hoping to start ramping up and getting more episodes out sooner than, you know, a month in between.
2563934	2567636	So look for that, hopefully in the next week or so.
2567636	2569036	All right.
2569036	2569236	Nice.
2570723	2575547	My Game of the Week, I've been playing Diablo 3, and no, that's not me misspeaking.
2575547	2585956	I'm pretty done with Diablo 4's season because I finished off the Battle Pass, so I went back to check out Diablo 3 and their latest season because this is the last season with anything new.
2586296	2587036	I'm almost up to level 70.
2587036	2588077	I've started from scratch with no help.
2609203	2614445	But that is, oh, I think that's the thing that lets you play offline on PC, finally.
2614445	2616826	After all these years, PC finally has an offline mode.
2616826	2622369	And I think if you play in that mode, then, yeah, you're not connected with other people or anything.
2622369	2627451	So there's no chance for you to pollute the pool, so to speak, by cheating.
2627451	2629972	So there's that.
2629972	2634674	But I've also been playing, I checked out Foam Stars, the beta for that.
2634674	2635255	You know that one?
2635255	2638156	That's the Square Enix one that everybody's like, oh, it's Splatoon.
2638696	2645318	And yeah, it's it's kind of Splatoon, but it's also a bit Overwatch because it's the hero stuff.
2645318	2650139	So like, you pick your particular person, and then they all have different abilities, right?
2650139	2654700	So like, one of them fires ice cream missiles, and another one might be more like a sniper.
2654700	2658461	And then it's interesting, because it's foam, so it's not like paint,
2659061	2670811	really it you build up and you do like these you can actually build like ramps to kind of like do and instead of going under the foam like you would in Splatoon, you ride a hoverboard on top of it.
2670811	2672552	And so you can do interesting things with that.
2672552	2674854	So yeah, it's, it's interesting.
2674854	2676356	What I find interesting about it is that
2677293	2681095	It's not really a PlayStation 5 graphic level game.
2681095	2688058	It's more what we would have honestly like PlayStation 3 or 4, but it looks it looks nice.
2688058	2693420	And the music is is very different since it's not like ska type of music like you hear in Splatoon.
2693420	2696962	It's more like, you know, J-pop type of stuff, which is interesting.
2696962	2698022	Yeah, I don't know.
2698022	2702084	Like if the game is free when it comes out, I'll check it out again.
2702084	2705365	But if they're going to charge 70 bucks to play it, I'm not interested.
2705365	2706586	Like that's not that's too much money.
2708328	2709189	But it's cute enough.
2724749	2730433	I'll play Overwatch with you, but my one stipulation is that I'm going to roll into a game as Widowmaker and I don't want to hear it.
2730433	2738138	Because usually there's a lot of negative stuff that comes with people playing Widowmaker, but I'm like, no, legit, I'm trying to get better at sniping and I'm not, I'm not bad at it.
2738138	2740479	And I know how to play Widow to like keep moving.
2740479	2747644	You don't want to stay in one spot and, you know, use her venom trap to, you know, alert you to when a Sombra is trying to get you and things like that.
2747644	2751546	So, yeah, it's been, it's been fun to dip into Overwatch a little bit.
2751546	2754068	I don't play a lot of it, but just, you know, a couple matches here and there.
2754868	2776065	um otherwise that's about it uh haven't been playing a lot of FFSE 14 which is not good because i think the new patch is out on Tuesday which means shucks i think there's a holiday event like i have to finish i haven't done yet i guess i need to do that tonight or tomorrow so uh i gotta get on that that game's keeping my subscription active active sometime somehow so
2777622	2778622	All right.
2778622	2779623	Um, let's see.
2779623	2781943	Mike Defton chat says, Rob, we should play together sometime.
2781943	2782904	Are you talking about Overwatch?
2782904	2786785	You must be talking about Overwatch, not Foam Stars, because Foam Stars beta is going to be done after tonight.
2786785	2787725	It's only for the weekend.
2787725	2790706	So I'm assuming you're talking about Overwatch because I know you play that.
2790706	2793147	So yeah, I can play sometime.
2793147	2794327	I'll have to stream it.
2794327	2796088	So I think I've streamed Overwatch before.
2796088	2801029	I'll stream it again and have like open lobbies or whatever you want to call it where we can team up and play.
2801029	2802850	It's fun.
2802850	2804030	That is my gaming week.
2804030	2805891	I was watching my friend play last night.
2805891	2806531	Yeah, it's
2807378	2810141	You know, it's a fun little time waster.
2810141	2811303	I can't play it.
2811303	2812864	I can't play it.
2812864	2813785	It still makes me sick.
2813785	2815327	Yeah, I hear it.
2815327	2822655	It can be very fast moving, which, yeah, if you, you know, have the first person stuff can get a little, yeah.
2822655	2822756	So.
2823377	2827979	All right, well, let's get some headlines out of the way here.
2827979	2832341	There's been a bit going on in the gaming world this week, so I'm going to punt it over to Loki.
2832341	2848268	Oh, let me say, though, quickly, as I did mention TwitchCon earlier, that does mean we will not be here live the night of October 22nd as DarkSakura, myself, and as it turns out, Bobby Blackwolf from the show that's on before us on Sunday nights, are all going to be at TwitchCon.
2848268	2849369	Bobby is working with the
2849969	2859175	Games Done Quick Express, I hope I called it the right name, but they're doing basically a smaller satellite version of Games Done Quick at TwitchCon.
2859175	2866260	And he's going to be one of the announcers for that as he has done some of the announcing for the larger events, awesome games and all that stuff.
2866260	2868522	So that's pretty cool to see that.
2868522	2873385	So I will let you, I will defer to his show for all the details on that.
2873385	2874386	All right, let's get to headlines.
2874386	2874566	Loki.
2875788	2893182	Yeah, so remember we talked a little bit about Sackgraftra and how, you know, they were doing the strike against the different movie studios and stuff, and one of the things that they were able to do, the members at least, were to still participate in video games, doing voice acting and motion capture and that type of stuff right now.
2893182	2893802	However...
2894643	2901026	how times have not changed, but how things have progressed over that short period of time.
2901026	2909811	Now, SAG-AFTRA members have actually approved a video game strike authorization vote with 98.32% yes.
2909811	2918535	So basically, that doesn't mean that they're necessarily striking yet, but that they're, you know, looking to negotiate better deals and that may lead to a strike.
2919109	2920450	Here pretty soon.
2920450	2933377	According to the head of, the president of SAG-AFTRA, Fran Drescher, says, it is time, it's time for video game companies to stop playing games and get serious about reaching an agreement on this contract.
2933377	2946864	The result of this vote shows our membership understands the existential nature of these negotiations and that the time is now for these companies, which are making billions of dollars and paying their CEOs lavishly,
2947364	2954147	to give our performers an agreement that keeps performing in video games as a viable career.
2954147	2963531	After five rounds of bargaining, it has become abundantly clear that the video game companies aren't willing to meaningfully engage on critical issues.
2963531	2971355	Compensation undercut by inflation, unregulated use of AI and safety, AI especially in the video game space,
2972896	2980806	I remain hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement that meets the members' needs, but our members are done being exploited.
2980806	2986613	If these corporations are willing to offer a fair deal, our next stop will be the picket lines.
2988313	2991174	I have to say I'm not surprised things are going this route.
2991174	2998818	I hate to say it like but obviously, you know, a lot of big game companies are kind of tied to movie studios as well.
2998818	3008582	Look at Sony, look at Warner Brothers, you know, with like Mortal Kombat and stuff like a lot of movie studios also have game companies or close relationships with it.
3008582	3011544	So it's not entirely surprising.
3011544	3014265	Unfortunately, obviously, I would like the studios to
3014825	3015025	No, I mean...
3041726	3043948	Yeah, it's it's that's what it takes.
3043948	3048591	But if that's what it takes to get the studios to make an agreement, then so be it.
3048591	3052314	I'm willing to have some games get delayed as a result.
3052314	3053695	It is what it is.
3053695	3057897	The Writers Guild was able to finally get what they were looking for.
3057897	3061160	That was the late breaking news right at the end of our show last week, wasn't it?
3061160	3061540	Yeah.
3061540	3063021	So that's excellent.
3063021	3066804	And then, of course, we're expecting, I think, the Screen Actors Guild to kind of
3068132	3090346	probably pretty closely follow them so maybe we'll hear something even this week about that but if it's you know they're able to negotiate better deals with the movie studios and tv studios and that type of stuff then you know i think that they should be able to negotiate better deals with video games why why should video games be like so special in that sense like if anything
3091640	3103869	I mean, if anything, I think for sure, especially when we're talking about protections against like AI and stuff, the video game space has been more prolific with trying to go that route, like saying, Oh, yeah, that's fine.
3103869	3107312	You know, we'll just pay you for your voice and then we'll use your voice forever.
3107312	3109273	I mean, what, what the hell, man?
3109273	3110234	You're not Ursula.
3110234	3112736	You can't just take someone's voice and use it however you want.
3112736	3115358	Okay, this is the video game industry.
3115358	3116779	You got to treat people like people.
3119941	3122404	I love that analogy.
3122404	3135178	The thing that's a little worrisome about the video game thing is that it might be very tempting for some individuals, because I know there's a lot of people out there that want to break into voice acting and video games, and it's going to be very tempting for some people to want to cross the picket lines to do
3136919	3137760	Get a role or something.
3137760	3144605	And I'm sure there will be companies that will look to try to fill some of their needs with folks that are aspiring and what have you.
3144605	3151411	So a big warning to you, do not cross picket lines to work with the big studios anyway.
3151411	3156115	And that will be important because there will still be indie game makers, not a part of this.
3156115	3156896	It's very similar.
3156896	3158357	Look at what's going on the movie side.
3158737	3161459	There are movies being made that are like exceptions, basically.
3161459	3164581	And there's still going to be indie studios that are not a part of this.
3164581	3167923	And so, you know, you continue to work with them, let them grow.
3167923	3169585	They're the ones we need to help flourish.
3169585	3169825	Right.
3169825	3171946	And all that, you know, help help to grow.
3171946	3180632	But be very careful about that type of stuff, because, again, if you, you know, cross the line, you're you're never going to get into SAG-AFTRA and the nanny will see to that.
3180632	3182514	That's for sure.
3182514	3183254	Looking in chat.
3184615	3191379	SSJ100 Matt says, uh, Fran Drescher talking about video games wasn't on my bingo card.
3191379	3194380	Um, yeah, but you know what?
3194380	3200883	Even the nanny has probably played a game of Candy Crush in her life, even if that statement was very obviously written for her, but that's okay.
3200883	3207527	She's a very busy person and, you know, doing her thing, uh, you know, running SAG-AFTRA and representing in the media and all that stuff.
3207527	3209388	So, um, yeah.
3210428	3214930	Uh, PodCulture in chat says cross in order to just feed their fam.
3214930	3221232	That's not really what I'm talking about because these would be people that are looking to get their break, uh, through this whole thing.
3221232	3224413	And that, yeah, that would not be acceptable.
3224413	3234357	Uh, usually in the cases of these big strikes, they have funds set up to help people that are striking because, you know, when we talk about actors and actresses striking, we're not talking about
3234817	3238119	TomCruises and JLo's, just that, right?
3238119	3245443	We're talking about people that often do get featured in backgrounds or get paid a hell of a lot less than you probably otherwise assume.
3245443	3254647	Look at what some of these people, like, you look at what people make on the convention circuit and you go, so-and-so charges $60 for an autograph or $80 for an autograph.
3254647	3254747	Yeah.
3256608	3265319	Look into how much they made for doing the show because I'll guarantee you it was probably something where you were like, whoa, I expected they made millions of dollars from this.
3265319	3266661	They probably made like $5,000 an episode.
3269312	3271134	if that, if that.
3271134	3272895	So, you know, something to consider.
3272895	3278159	But they have funds set up to help people that are struggling due to the strike and things like that.
3278159	3278359	Yeah.
3278359	3284904	In fact, actually, because of all that, there was like some big actors actually donated quite a bit of money to those strike funds as well.
3284904	3287466	So there's a lot of solidarity going around.
3287466	3288367	There definitely is.
3288367	3288507	So.
3289387	3317138	nobody should should have to cross to do that if anybody felt like they needed to I'm sure they could get in touch with one of these funds and and figure out their options such as you know there's also again indie companies and smaller studios you know if this does go through it's only going to be the major studios that are impacted I'm not sure if that would necessarily include like EA and Ubisoft I didn't read into it or if it's just the ones that are tied to movie studios but even if it did impact the the AAA players like it did last time there's still going to be plenty of
3318178	3322680	companies that are indie and not a part of this.
3322680	3324600	All right, let's move on.
3324600	3330042	Let's talk about some updates going on in the MetaQuest side of things.
3330042	3341347	So as it is today, MetaQuest will allow you to stream Xbox games to the MetaQuest, or the Oculus if you will, and actually let you play video games in it.
3341347	3347589	But now what's happening is that the MetaQuest 3 is going to get official support for Xbox
3347809	3349371	CloudGaming.
3349371	3355360	Now, to be fair, this was already announced at last year's MetaConnect, is what they call that.
3355360	3362950	But at this year's event, Mark Zuckerberg, who is the CEO of Facebook, they say meta, but it's just...
3363911	3365972	I hate all these new tech company names.
3365972	3368873	I'm not calling it X. I'm not calling it Meta, even if I did.
3368873	3372614	At least Meta is a better name than X. Like, you know, I'll give it that.
3372614	3373415	I'll give it that.
3373415	3376716	At least the names continue to somehow progressively get worse.
3376716	3380717	But anyway, now we know when this is going to happen and what it's going to look like.
3380717	3386059	So it's going to happen at some point in December, and you'll be able to stream games from the cloud to the headset.
3386059	3388780	I think the reason why this is such a big deal is because now
3389320	3391982	It basically takes the Xbox out of the equation, right?
3391982	3394184	Or, if you will, the gaming console.
3394184	3408676	Because, remember, the big thing about, you know, where MetaQuest are now, and the advantage, I guess, that it has over the PlayStation or PSVR 2, if you will, or some of the other VR competitors, that it doesn't hook up, and you can just put the headset device on your head, and that's it.
3408676	3410077	That's the VR thing.
3410077	3414521	So this is literally going to allow you to have the power of an Xbox in the headset.
3415001	3416442	through the cloud.
3416442	3417463	So that's going to be pretty cool.
3417463	3423686	So of course, you'll be able to play things that are offered in Xbox Cloud Gaming, Forza Horizon, Halo Infinite, Starfield.
3423686	3428149	Now, it doesn't make all those games suddenly VR.
3428149	3432992	What it is, is that it's a large 2D virtual screen that you're playing on.
3432992	3437574	So think like some of those apps that let you watch a movie on a fake screen, things like that.
3437574	3438535	That's what it's going to be.
3438910	3449288	I remember I didn't watch the full presentation for this but I think that this allows you to do kind of that whole AR virtual screen thing like the Apple
3451524	3472243	I didn't see how AR was involved either but again it's not gonna I think the bigger point is that it's not gonna suddenly make the games VR because they weren't programmed to be that way yeah maybe your environments that you're playing in you can kind of change up and things like that but yeah you'll be able to play the games on a 2d screen but still
3473064	3477549	As long as you have, of course, Game Pass Ultimate, because that's what you need to get Xbox Cloud Gaming.
3477549	3481513	But it is still putting the power of the Xbox in a device that can attach to your head.
3481513	3485758	So that's, you know, and someday, you know, we're getting closer and closer.
3485758	3493426	Someday, those devices are going to have 5G internet when that populates more and more that you could be anywhere.
3494364	3497065	with one of those things on your head play in those games.
3497065	3499887	It's gonna be very interesting when we get to that point.
3499887	3506250	But I could already see a use case for this now is that like, let's say, let's say Loki is playing Starfield on the TV.
3506250	3507170	I'm making up a scenario.
3507170	3508331	I know you're not really playing Starfield.
3508331	3510752	We're gonna say Loki's playing Starfield on the TV.
3510752	3515394	And then Mrs. Loki comes in and says Grey's Anatomy's on, I want the TV.
3515394	3519596	Loki can now take his game and put it on the headset and play right there.
3519596	3522137	And then Mrs. Loki can continue to watch Grey's Anatomy
3522387	3526913	But you don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy in 3D in VR.
3526913	3528835	You'd be right there.
3528835	3536204	Oh, your solution is to give Mrs. Loki the headset and say, you want to watch Grey's Anatomy on the headset.
3536204	3537827	So I'd be right there in the drama.
3539534	3541536	Mercy in the drama.
3541536	3543057	I love it.
3543057	3545178	But yeah, so that's, you know, that's gonna be pretty cool.
3545178	3551463	And now, of course, you know, it goes without saying, Activision Blizzard and that deal looks like it's gonna be a thing.
3551463	3559149	It's only a matter of time before we're talking Overwatch 2, Call of Duty, also potentially in the MetaQuest 3.
3559149	3561251	So interesting how that's all shaping up.
3561251	3568356	Can we talk about how ridiculous the whole their AI avatar, like,
3569002	3569783	Thanks for watching!
3585405	3591047	They have Snoop Dogg as a DM for like a Dungeons & Dragons type roleplaying thing.
3591047	3601290	Like, I know when I think of Dungeons & Dragons, Snoop Dogg is certainly the first person that comes to mind when it's like, it's like you couldn't have gotten anybody like else for that.
3601290	3605231	Maybe I would have stuck with Baldur's Gate 3 if it was Snoop Dogg.
3605931	3608513	Like, it just looks, it looks so ridiculous.
3608513	3611294	I'm like, is that, like, an AI-generated image?
3611294	3621860	Is it not really, like, is it like, haha, it's funny, because I can have Snoop Dogg as my, you know, RPG, uh, you know, DM or whatever, and like, well, I can really do anybody.
3621860	3626943	But no, that's who we chose as the RPG guy is Snoop Dogg.
3626943	3629725	Like, what?
3629725	3630645	Why?
3630645	3631906	Why would you do that?
3631906	3633687	Like, you could,
3634376	3637099	You could talk to him about music.
3637099	3639622	You could talk to him about like drugs.
3639622	3645649	I mean, like, I just don't see him as D&D guy unless there's a part of him that I really am not familiar with.
3646061	3653025	The best thing you could do to show that you hate this shit is not use them.
3653025	3654626	Don't use them as a joke.
3654626	3657208	Don't use them for the lulz.
3657208	3658008	Because you know what?
3658008	3663111	Facebook puts a lot of this stuff people didn't ask for or sometimes even did ask for.
3663111	3667794	For example, remember when we used to be able to play games like Pac-Man inside messaging app?
3667794	3669535	Yeah, they took it away because nobody was using it.
3669995	3678326	So if you want to show your distaste for AI, resist any temptation to just get the tee-hees off of Snoop Dogg being your DM.
3678326	3681070	There are other ways you can support Snoop Dogg.
3681070	3683213	He has his own line of wine.
3683213	3685997	That's an excellent way for you to support Snoop Dogg.
3685997	3686497	Not this.
3687379	3687939	Not this.
3709057	3710618	It is the guy from Dungeons and Drag Queens.
3710618	3720904	He's the guy that does Dimension 20 and he is just a fantastic... Like, I cannot... I don't want to get on a tangent about talking about Dropout TV, but I fucking love that.
3720904	3724546	That entire, like, network is just great.
3724546	3727107	Like, honestly, like, I really like it.
3727107	3732490	It's independent artists doing independent things, separate from all these other, you know, big companies.
3732490	3734451	It's really good produced, you know,
3735164	3735684	content.
3735684	3737205	I eat it all up.
3737205	3739967	But like Brendan Lee Mulligan, seriously, I watch any... I can't hate on that.
3739967	3742208	I can't hate on AI trying to reproduce.
3742208	3743309	Yes, absolutely.
3743309	3747311	You know, no, then you would never be able to recreate Brendan Lee Mulligan.
3747311	3751033	But yeah, second season of Dungeons and Drag Queens coming sometime.
3751033	3751914	Is it the same roster?
3751914	3753354	Are they gonna mix up the drag queens?
3753354	3754275	I don't know.
3754275	3755556	But it is a season two.
3755556	3755956	So that
3756948	3759369	Let's move on to something you can do on your phones besides Facebook.
3779037	3788928	Oh, well, I mean, there's plenty of things that you can do on your phone besides Facebook, but you can also play Resident Evil 4 Remake on iPhone 15.
3788928	3795034	It is available to be ordered on the App Store.
3795034	3797516	It will be released, quote, for free.
3798838	3802760	You know, so you can play through the first mission before you have to pay full price.
3802760	3805001	So what is that full price?
3805001	3806743	60 bucks!
3806743	3813427	You can also purchase weapon upgrade tickets, the ones that are available in the current versions of the game.
3813427	3827336	But yeah, you are buying a full-on game to be played on your tiny handheld computer for what the game normally costs anyway for a full version of the game.
3828172	3836615	So some people might balk at that because they think, oh, my cell phone, it's this, you know, it's not going to play real games.
3836615	3839516	No, your your phone is a computer.
3839516	3847359	And this is a small screen, yes, but it is a full game running on a computer with a dedicated programmed version for it.
3847359	3849520	So 60 bucks.
3849520	3850120	Not surprised.
3850760	3856742	I definitely understand why people are getting their knickers in a twist over this because we've kind of been conditioned.
3856742	3863664	I mean, even when the Final Fantasy Pixel remaster was like $20 on cell phone, a lot of people balked at that.
3863664	3868066	But I actually, I may surprise you and actually go, yeah, I get it.
3868066	3874008	If they're going to charge $60 for Resident Evil on iOS, here's the thing that's really changing my mind on this whole thing.
3875294	3882218	This whole talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on the Nintendo Switch and how they're charging $70 for that.
3882218	3896025	And the reality is the iPhone 15 and the Google equivalent, to be fair, I don't want to be accused of playing favorites, that those, those little computers, as DarkSakura put it, in your hand are probably more powerful than a Nintendo Switch.
3896025	3899427	So if you're going to justify paying... Probably?
3899427	3900008	Definitely.
3900008	3900328	Definitely.
3900328	3901128	Yeah.
3901128	3902789	If you're going to justify paying 60 or 70 bucks
3904623	3917894	for Mortal Kombat 1 on your Switch, then it's not outside the realm of possibility to ask to pay that on your iPhone, your Android, whatever.
3917894	3918595	Especially now.
3918595	3928043	Now, I would usually balk at that because I would say, I'm not playing a f-ing touchscreen version of the game, but we all know you can hook up Bluetooth devices now and you know, da-da-da-da.
3928043	3932447	You could play legit, you know, just like you're playing it on a Switch or whatever it is.
3932827	3938413	But it's steps though, like I mean, like they don't sell the switch without controllers.
3938413	3944540	Yeah, but I'm as far as the price of the game, like that's to talk about the ecosystem, talk about the price of the game.
3944540	3945441	Like I get it.
3945441	3946342	And you know what, here's the thing.
3946342	3946682	Here's the thing.
3946682	3949786	At the end of the day, it is very, very, very, very easy to not buy it.
3950833	3958517	And I think the reality of the $60 and $70 price tag is, like, this is a whole greater conversation.
3958517	3965101	I'm not talking about iPhone, I'm just talking about the sticker shock of these prices of games on any platform you're playing it on.
3965101	3968723	Because I know a lot of people... Oh, go ahead.
3968723	3972165	I'm sorry, I just wanted to add in the point too that you can airplay this to a TV.
3973300	3974540	Oh, fair point.
3974540	3975861	Fair point.
3975861	3978362	And you can use a normal controller with it.
3978362	3987245	I mean, and it's, it's not really, I think, as big of a deal as people thinking it is.
3987245	3994887	You can actually take something much more useful than a Steam Deck.
3997336	3999760	and play the game wherever you freaking want.
3999760	4001483	You can use your cellular to play.
4001483	4003105	I mean, I wouldn't recommend it, but you could.
4003105	4004608	Yeah.
4004608	4010597	So, I mean, you there you're honestly it's almost like you're getting a better value.
4011816	4017158	But well, speaking of that value, there's a lot of people that don't want to pay 60, 70 bucks for any game.
4017158	4020059	And you know, and what I find is happening to be them.
4020059	4025581	Well, what I find is happening is that people are playing a little bit of video game chicken.
4025581	4028322	And I actually think we kind of all do it in one way or another.
4028322	4029803	I'll say in one way, I'm doing it.
4029803	4033964	I'll speak right up and say, Mortal Kombat one is an excellent example.
4033964	4036866	No way in hell am I paying $70 for that game?
4036866	4037586	Because I know
4038266	4039767	I know it's a waiting game.
4039767	4048673	And six months down the line, the Game of the Year edition that includes all of the DLC and all this other stuff will either also be $70 or probably price cut.
4048673	4054056	In fact, I bet Mortal Kombat 1, as it is, price cut on Black Friday down to $45.
4055737	4059340	So the question becomes, how bad do you want it?
4059340	4066425	And you might you might say, Rob, if you wait for all your games to go on sale, you're not really supporting the industry or any of that stuff.
4066425	4067486	Hold on.
4067486	4069707	I didn't say I do this with every game.
4069707	4075031	I think we all pick and choose our battles with how much are we willing to pay for the game.
4075031	4077913	And the same thing happens in the other arts too.
4077913	4078814	Movies.
4078814	4081416	Are you going to pay to go see it on the big screen?
4081416	4083618	Or are you going to wait for it to hit Disney Plus?
4084518	4089202	A lot of people do this battle in a lot of different mediums and different ways.
4089202	4095188	And so for me, yeah, I'm going to wait for Mortal Kombat 1 to go on a discount because I just, I don't need it right away.
4095188	4098370	I know y'all are saying it's a great game and yeah, okay, okay.
4098370	4101953	I believe you, but I'm perfectly content being on the sidelines until later.
4101953	4102154	Now.
4103262	4106685	You want to talk about Final Fantasy 16.
4106685	4109527	You want to talk about Diablo 4.
4109527	4115612	Now those are the games where I go, oh, we're buying the tickets to see it in IMAX.
4115612	4121056	I'm buying the family pass to get the front row and a large popcorn because I'm a fan.
4121056	4123257	Front row IMAX you.
4123257	4124538	But you know what I'm getting at, right?
4124538	4128441	I'm paying for the premium seats to go see this.
4129242	4131184	So premium seats, concerts, right?
4131184	4133365	Another another thing that people paid in price for.
4133365	4144714	But anyway, my point is, the premium being asked for here on iOS, Android, however you slice it, is no different from what it is on other gaming platforms.
4144714	4152680	And so for that reason, I actually I find this whole thing a little bit sensationalist and also but but but on one hand,
4153515	4161542	We don't see it a lot, so I get it, but I think it's just a barometer of where the industry is going.
4161542	4162043	And that's that.
4163877	4170679	I'm going to chat because I'm sure some of you were going to light up and chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
4170679	4171599	Let's see.
4171599	4177460	Jaskrand in chat says my biggest worry with iOS game purchases is support for future versions of iOS.
4177460	4182242	Do I want to spend $60 on a game that I don't know will run on iOS 20 plus?
4182242	4187003	Well, to be fair, how are those PlayStation 3 games working out on your PlayStation 5?
4188277	4196481	So, I mean, I get your point, but it isn't totally different in other worlds either.
4196481	4203144	Um, let's see, uh, BondSub06 says, I have a collection of film stubs here going back as far as 2001.
4203144	4206005	Jaskren says, compare it to buying Doom Remake on Windows.
4206005	4211047	There's an expectation that I'll be able to play it well into the future on future versions of Windows.
4211047	4217430	Um, and cloud gaming could make for a very interesting conversation on all of this in the future, to be quite honest.
4219011	4220953	to be continued, I suppose, on that.
4220953	4223915	Well, and here's also the thing.
4223915	4226677	With iOS games, they are technically cloud-based.
4226677	4245573	You know, if I, say I paid 60 bucks for this game, it's now tied on my Apple ID, and my phone gets run over by a semi, and the, you know, running over by a semi insurance pays for my new phone, all I have to do is sign back in, restore my backup, the game will start re-downloading.
4246712	4250254	Same with just about any device these days.
4250254	4263301	So unlike if your cartridge gets broken or something is delisted, it's actually tied to the account that follows you everywhere.
4263301	4266563	If you get a new phone, you can install it on the new phone.
4266563	4270906	And I will also add in that M1 Macs
4271906	4278491	Well, the Silicon series will run a lot of iOS software.
4278491	4280873	So in reality, you may be getting it for two devices.
4282047	4287809	Um, I want to read this comment in chat too, because this one really got me thinking, and I love when the chat comments get me thinking.
4287809	4292910	SheHulk10 in chat says, A great game has no price limit for me.
4292910	4298012	Some free games on Game Pass, I feel the need to pay companies for their excellence.
4298012	4299432	And I think of a couple scenarios here.
4299432	4307155	I think of, I'm not going to call her out, but maybe a little bit, DarkSakura's impressive collection of cosmetics on Dead by Daylight.
4309417	4312221	Hey, I got to keep all those, so I was happy.
4312221	4317089	But that's a game that's brought you literal hundreds.
4317089	4318110	Are you up to a thousand hours?
4318110	4319593	I bet you're up to a thousand hours.
4320092	4321033	I can check.
4321033	4328157	Well, I mean, I was already there on Stadia, so my Steam would, I don't know.
4328157	4333881	I mean, you were talking about two years of Stadia play and then whatever I've done on Steam.
4333881	4337063	But and then and then here you go, DarkSakura, I teased you.
4337063	4343868	I'll give you one another example of this where SheHulk is talking about, you know, sometimes you feel the need to pay companies to the excellence.
4344828	4348914	I don't know anybody that's ever bought the same game on multiple consoles.
4348914	4349434	No.
4349434	4356103	Who on earth would have bought Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U just to say they bought Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U?
4356103	4357104	Who would have done that?
4360192	4364475	I've got several different iterations of Link to the Past.
4364475	4368837	I have Breath of the Wild on Wii U and Wii.
4368837	4373400	Atari cartridges that are probably sitting in their garage.
4373400	4378443	Who on earth would buy new versions of Atari cartridges that are probably sitting in their garage?
4378443	4380844	Couldn't be me.
4380844	4381965	I've done that too.
4385332	4390019	I think we have Ikaruga, like Orange Rice said, how many copies of Ikaruga?
4391043	4393866	How many versions of Final Fantasy fucking six?
4393866	4395667	Oh, a brilliant point.
4395667	4396248	I love this.
4396248	4399591	Now the chat is the chat is unloading, unloading.
4399591	4402353	Bonds 006 says Pokemon remakes.
4402353	4404074	Damn, could be me.
4404074	4406376	Oh, oh, let's talk about a friend of ours.
4406376	4409119	And just when when a Pokemon game comes out.
4409119	4409860	Right.
4409860	4414964	And literally the Pokemon model is to entice you to buy what is essentially the same game twice.
4414964	4415585	Let's be real.
4416265	4418068	So that's a whole other thing.
4418068	4419129	That's funny.
4419129	4431306	PodCulture in chat says, same kind of person who bought the movies Serenity in all available formats, VHS, HD, DVD, and PSP, UMD.
4432907	4433528	Damn.
4433528	4434048	Impressive.
4434048	4440391	Or how about my collection of Transformers the movie copies, which I have the Japanese Laserdisc.
4440391	4443352	I have multiple DVD Blu-ray versions.
4443352	4450856	I have a video CD of the Japanese version of it that was the only one I could get before I got my Laserdisc.
4450856	4453197	Anyway, I think we've made our point.
4453197	4458500	It's very hard to put a price tag on how far you're willing to take your fandoms.
4459480	4465887	To paraphrase, by the way, one of our favorite animated things, I'm a consumer whore!
4465887	4466588	And how!
4466588	4468009	And how!
4468009	4474816	Hi, I like things, the end, bye.
4474816	4476218	I know, I know.
4476218	4479061	Oh god, I forgot my Gatchaman collection of stuff.
4479547	4484430	Okay, unfortunately, we're having a laugh at capitalism's, you know, about all that.
4484430	4489133	But unfortunately, now we get to the dark side of capitalism with this next story.
4489133	4493936	So Loki, please take it away with another very big headline from this week.
4493936	4496438	So Epic Games has cut their workforce by 870 jobs, or 16%.
4496438	4498619	Apparently, they said for, you know,
4503722	4508023	For a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn.
4508023	4509504	This is coming from Tim Sweeney.
4509504	4515226	It says, I've been long optimistic or long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs.
4515226	4519267	But in retrospect, I see that this was unrealistic.
4519267	4522828	That's a nice way of saying, you know, thanks for your help.
4522828	4526489	I refuse to take a pay cut for my employees.
4526489	4532391	Laid off employees will receive six months severance and health benefits.
4532391	4532931	And yeah.
4533757	4535958	So that sucks.
4535958	4545561	But this is not like this is a very common thing, unfortunately.
4545561	4547782	And how much of a pay cut is Tim Sweeney taking?
4548967	4565329	because certainly, certainly if we're talking about that we have acquisitions that didn't go the way as intended, if we're talking about that the market has pivoted towards this, you know, community based games, which I actually think is a good thing, like, that's pretty cool that you know, they have the whole community program.
4565729	4592909	and that but if if the market is pivoting that way which in turn has them making less money um surely surely uh an executive or a ceo or somebody that's paid to not do anything with the games but to do the business surely the business folks are are are setting things up to you have a little bit bad um are also going to be partaking in some of these cutbacks correct
4593753	4596154	Yeah, I'm sure, of course.
4596154	4603135	Along with the layoffs, they were also going to be selling Bandcamp, which I forgot that they even owned.
4603135	4609197	And spinning off, they said most of the marketing company is super awesome.
4609197	4614638	I don't think it was super awesome that they, you know, laid all those people off.
4614638	4617239	And going to the chat, love this comment.
4617239	4622540	SSG0100 Matt says taps the sign of Iwata took a pay cut to keep his staff.
4622540	4622840	Mm hmm.
4623672	4624172	Mm hmm.
4624172	4625393	That part.
4625393	4632256	This, this is why when we talk about Iwata and his legacy, we say nice things.
4632256	4633456	For the most part.
4633456	4635597	I mean, nobody's nobody's perfect.
4635597	4637658	But for the most part, we say nice things.
4637658	4645541	When we talk about Tim Sweeney, and what type of dumbfuck comment he's made on Twitter this week.
4645541	4652884	It's not exactly not exactly in that same bubble of love that we have for folks like Iwata.
4654283	4657005	I wonder why.
4657005	4659848	No idea.
4659848	4661710	Um, let's see, I was gonna say a lot.
4661710	4662851	I knew how to code a game.
4662851	4664313	But to be fair, so did Tim Sweeney.
4664313	4666475	And to be fair, Tim Sweeney knew how to code great games.
4666475	4668437	And that's what makes this even more frustrating.
4668437	4670619	Tim Sweeney's been there.
4670619	4674823	So it's, it's very frustrating, actually.
4674823	4674943	Um,
4676765	4679947	You always, what's the quote?
4679947	4682968	You live long enough to see the hero become the villain, something like that.
4682968	4686069	Anyway, let's see.
4686069	4690391	Fifth Dream in chat says, I feel guilty getting all those free games.
4690391	4698395	I'm not sure if that was a response to what we were talking about earlier, or perhaps the Epic Game Store and all of their free giveaway games that they do.
4698395	4700436	But again, you shouldn't feel bad about that.
4700436	4702457	That's all business deals that they're doing.
4702817	4707979	They pay the because this was all brought out into the open some time ago through court documents.
4707979	4716222	They pay those companies a flat fee, say $50,000 for maybe a small indie title to potentially millions for a large AAA title.
4716222	4719143	They pay money to put that game out there for free.
4719143	4722164	That again, business decision.
4722164	4731647	Okay, you fifth dream in your computer room, office, bedroom, whatever downloading this game and taking advantage of the deal.
4732604	4736145	has nothing to do with the fact that that deal was already signed, sealed, delivered.
4736145	4740906	Now, the popularity of the game may affect future deals and that sort of thing.
4740906	4749448	I suppose if you want to go that way, but I don't think you should feel bad about taking the opportunity that was presented to you.
4749448	4755670	If that's even what the comment was about, because it may have been about the last story to be fair.
4755670	4755810	So
4757453	4768764	DJ Roma asked with a very fair comment in chat saying, much respect to Iwata for what we're talking about, but it seems that what Iwata did is more a Japanese cultural thing though.
4768764	4772327	Be nice if more American upper management would do that.
4772327	4779914	Yes, it probably was, in fact, a cultural thing, and it is one of those things where we kind of go,
4780735	4791162	You know, considering this is the gaming industry and such the weight that the Japanese market plays on the gaming industry, it is a little disappointing we don't see more American executives.
4791162	4793984	But I guess that would be un-American for them to do that.
4796102	4799225	Anyway, um, let's see.
4799225	4804550	S2100mat says, how much of that money that Epic spent fighting with Apple in the courts could have been used to keep staff?
4804550	4805511	Just saying.
4805511	4806712	Fair.
4806712	4809074	Um, let's see.
4809074	4815059	Questbuster says, from those court docs, Epic noted that they expect Epic Game Store to be profitable in 2023.
4816447	4822208	But interestingly, Apple also countered saying that they expect it to be profitable by 2027, if ever.
4822208	4825229	You know what would make the Epic Games Store profitable?
4825229	4828069	Having a better application.
4828069	4828709	Yes.
4828709	4831730	I'm just like, I'm just gonna call it what it is.
4831730	4836751	For as long as the Epic Games Store has been out, it still feels- How long has it been?
4836751	4841351	A while, and it is still basic as fuck.
4841351	4844272	Especially next to something like
4845172	4847335	Epic Games Store is still resting on the laurels of Fortnite
4865854	4889170	in order to carry forward and that is not a read on the hardworking programmers of the store that is a read on the business developers allocating said resources that's why the Epic Games Store is not profitable it's not it's it's not as attractive as Steam that's what it is anyway
4890950	4894935	give me a reason to really use the Epic Games Store outside the free games.
4894935	4899701	Because you know, there's, oh, yeah, SEO 100 Matt says, How long did it take them to figure out a shopping cart?
4899701	4901423	Oh, yeah, I remember that one.
4901423	4902604	But it's very complex.
4902604	4906649	Like it's not like something that websites have had since the beginning of the internet.
4906930	4912372	But you know, I understand that these, you know, you can't just flip a switch and bam, we have a shopping cart.
4912372	4915533	They are things that you have to, you know, plan to do.
4915533	4917093	But that is my point.
4917093	4926116	It is an executive's job to be strategically thinking about these types of plans and plan for these types of things.
4926116	4931538	And if Tim Sweeney has failed on that, where's his cut?
4931538	4935579	And not just him, the other senior executives at this company.
4936316	4940477	Where's, where's the fall on them?
4940477	4947059	Anyway, it's just, it sucks that here we are yet again, asking that question.
4947059	4951140	When is an executive going to be held responsible for the mistakes?
4951140	4956422	Because we still have Bobby Kotick.
4956422	4961283	The greatest disease on this industry is still gainfully employed.
4961283	4962864	And that sucks.
4966516	4986169	Tim Sweeney, honestly, is like a stage... Tim Sweeney is a mini-grunt in stage 1-1 compared to the end boss Bowser, or no, he's Wart, that Bobby Kotick is.
4986169	4986609	I said it.
4988457	4990759	Let's move on though.
4990759	4997943	Let's talk about someone who has another interesting reputation, a reputation of a much different sort in the industry.
4997943	5004107	Hideki Kamiya, going to be leaving Platinum Games, the studio that he co-founded.
5004107	5005068	That's right.
5005068	5008130	The director of games like Bayonetta, the wonderful 101,
5009891	5012653	He founded this company back in 2006.
5012653	5016856	And he was recently promoted even to VP.
5016856	5022900	But now he said on social media, this was no means by no means excuse me, an easy decision to make.
5022900	5023540	But he's leaving.
5023540	5027783	He's exiting the company on October 12.
5027783	5033507	As for the why that gets a little more misty, because we don't we don't really get a clear reason here.
5033507	5038450	But he says the move came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs.
5039763	5049192	And he says he's going to continue to make games, but he doesn't say if he's going to another company, starting another studio, who knows, but he's in his early 50s.
5049192	5051494	He's only like seven years older than I am.
5051494	5054236	So he's probably not retiring.
5054917	5058960	So a lot of folks are asking, what's going to happen to Bayonetta?
5058960	5060822	What's going to happen to these other games?
5060822	5062383	Honestly, they'll continue on.
5062383	5071350	I don't know how Bayonetta 3 sold, but I'm assuming if it sold well enough, which I have no reason to think it'll continue on, they'll continue to do it without them.
5071350	5075153	And they'll have creative folks that'll do their own take on it, but I'm sure we'll do fine.
5076722	5085166	Yeah, well, and on top of that, that would almost give Kamiya a chance to try something similar elsewhere.
5085166	5086246	Yeah.
5086246	5088127	So we'll see what happens.
5088127	5090168	It'll be interesting.
5090168	5093410	All right, let's move on.
5093410	5100153	Another series of a game director who's long left the company, but we're still seeing that series continue, DarkSakura.
5101487	5105451	So, um, we brought up, uh, Kojima earlier.
5105451	5115441	So, uh, I'm sure that by now people know about the Psycho Mantis scene in Metal Gear, you know, which was funny.
5115441	5121547	It even mentioned games that hadn't quite come out yet when you would do like the read your memory card thing, you know.
5122647	5131291	So that easter egg is going to stay when the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, when people are playing through that.
5131291	5136914	So you can make like a virtual memory card so that it would work in the game.
5140476	5147022	Some of the games that were listed in the Japanese version include Snatcher and Policenauts, for example.
5147022	5149384	I think that's pretty awesome.
5149384	5152847	I wonder if some of that would stay over for the U.S.
5152847	5152967	one.
5152967	5158812	You know, some games that we didn't get but niche versions of them over here.
5158812	5160073	But I think that that's awesome.
5160073	5163936	You know, have some DDR on there maybe.
5163936	5165077	It'd be nice.
5165077	5165898	So, yeah.
5168128	5171689	I think I yeah, I'm actually looking forward to this collection.
5171689	5177150	Because, you know, I have to be honest, you know, the Metal Gear Solid series was one I always kind of, I don't want to say I slept on it.
5177150	5179771	But it's like, there's there's never enough time to play every game.
5179771	5181511	And I never got around to really playing this series.
5181511	5183352	So I'm kind of excited to revisit it.
5183352	5187533	And obviously, I've always heard about this legendary, you know, Psycho Mantis sequence.
5187533	5189693	Oh, I've seen this part of the game, of course.
5189693	5191193	And now it like region memory card.
5191193	5193614	So I like that they kind of found their own way to recreate it.
5193614	5197535	You know, even if it's like a fake memory card you're putting together, like, I still think that's pretty fun.
5199345	5204829	There's all kinds of like little neat things that you can do in the first Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid.
5204829	5218338	Like if you get a handkerchief from a sniper wolf, I don't remember how to do this, it's been an age, but if you have it equipped like the wolves won't try to attack you because they smell her.
5219982	5228965	So like all kinds of little things on there for, for, you know, uh, doing different things, like even equipping the cigarettes does something in other rooms.
5228965	5232646	So, I mean, there's all kinds of just little nods.
5232646	5233546	All right.
5233546	5234167	Well, let's move on.
5234167	5238728	We have a few more stories, then we're going to get to the classic video game of the week, or are we?
5238728	5239929	I'll explain in a minute.
5239929	5242049	Uh, Loki.
5242049	5242709	Uh, yeah.
5242709	5243790	So there is this,
5245554	5254020	There is an event that was done for Van Gogh's 50th anniversary, or I should say the Van Gogh Museum's 50th anniversary.
5254020	5256121	He's been gone a little longer than that.
5256121	5257522	Yeah, exactly.
5257522	5261084	And well, it sounds like a great thing in the beginning.
5261084	5264266	Then you then you mentioned that it has to do with Pokemon.
5264266	5265647	You're like, oh.
5267126	5281600	And so of course, with anything Pokemon, from Happy Meals to apparently the Van Gogh Museum's 50th Anniversary, there was several items that were for sale that were exclusive to that.
5282892	5288034	And so of course, scalpers and everybody just rushed the place and made a mess of everything.
5288034	5298378	So of course, you know, there is a tote bag from the event for 50 bucks, which also included a Pikachu collector card from the trading card game.
5298912	5303093	And now, of course, the trading card game card is up to $700 online.
5303093	5307334	You know, the tote bag's 50 bucks.
5307334	5311835	There is, you know, people taking artwork and they're scalping it online.
5311835	5313715	People are disgusting.
5313715	5315115	I mean, you already knew that.
5315115	5323137	And people that are trying to profit off of scalping this stuff are disgusting.
5323137	5323297	But.
5325130	5326811	What can you do?
5326811	5329192	There's nothing you can do, really.
5329192	5331192	You have to stop supporting scalpers.
5331192	5333193	Unfortunately, that's not going to happen.
5333193	5335554	We're going to make a pact.
5335554	5337034	We're never supporting scalpers.
5337034	5341196	Unfortunately, there's people out there with a lot of disposable money that'll just keep doing it.
5341196	5342577	And it sucks.
5342577	5343877	You literally feel helpless.
5343877	5345458	What can you do?
5345458	5345778	I don't know.
5347458	5354042	Anyway, this is why then this is why some of it's getting ugly, like people meeting scalpers.
5354042	5358064	What was it the PlayStation five scalpers in parking lots just to rob them?
5358064	5359365	Not that I would ever endorse it.
5359365	5370672	But I'm just saying people's frustration with this sort of thing is getting so like it's brimming over that like this is where you see the ugly side of it really coming out, you know, and and all these I'm sure there's plenty of YouTubes of people fucking with scalpers.
5371092	5379057	They're showing like there's a video on online that's showing people just rushing the gift store and like it's like it's a mob.
5379057	5388062	It's like a Black Friday sale mob just rushing in there and just tearing the place apart like.
5388062	5391323	It's a cartoon, it's a trading card game.
5391323	5393204	What's wrong with you people?
5393204	5395666	Like, is this really worth it to make a few bucks?
5395666	5397687	Like, apparently they think it is.
5397687	5399028	I don't know.
5399028	5399528	It's nuts.
5401138	5402679	Alright, moving on.
5402679	5408742	We've had a lot of discussion this evening about kind of the cost, the price of a video game, and how much are you willing to pay for a game.
5408742	5418366	And it's interesting, in some timely remarks, the president of Capcom, Haruhiro Tsujimoto, suggests that maybe it's time to raise the price of games again.
5418366	5424309	And, you know, it wasn't that long ago that we just talked about raising the price to 70 bucks, you know, to support, you know, the
5425249	5429392	A report on September 23rd from Nikkei had some remarks from Sujimoto at the Tokyo Game Show about some various topics.
5443005	5450654	Development costs are about 100 times higher than during the Famicom era, but software prices have not gone up that much.
5450654	5453198	There is also a need to raise wages.
5453198	5460486	Considering the fact that wages are rising in the industry as a whole, I think raising unit prices is a healthy option for business.
5461347	5474093	and then went on to, you know, explain that, you know, recessions and the other factors in the business world, they shouldn't matter when it comes to game prices, but they say those factors have little to do with the game industry.
5474093	5480136	Just because there's a recession doesn't mean you won't go to the movie theater or your favorite artist concert.
5480136	5482597	High quality games will continue to sell.
5484058	5494223	Right, but the problem with that whole statement is assuming that the only cost of a game like back in the Famicom era is the purchase price of the game.
5494223	5496765	And we know that's absolutely not true.
5496765	5501487	Capcom especially knows it's not true because it's not just the game purchase.
5501487	5503268	It is a battle pass.
5503268	5505209	It is the DLC.
5505209	5509231	It is all the other nonsense, the cosmetics and stuff that they throw on top of it.
5509231	5511893	So don't even pretend that first off that they're selling a game for $70.
5512973	5516315	But then they're also making all this money, billions of dollars off the back of stuff.
5516315	5518136	And hey, here's a funny idea.
5518136	5523780	If it's not profitable to do that, then don't make games that cost so much in development.
5523780	5533927	There are a lot of smaller independent games that require a lot less money, that are solely unique, versus you making Resident Evil some more times.
5535780	5539402	I'm sorry, I just don't buy a lot of this stuff.
5539402	5548687	Yes, the cost has gone up for these studios, but no one's forcing them to also employ this many employees to make these complex games.
5548687	5556851	And even still, when they go and sell a $70 game, not necessarily Capcom in this instance, but it's not up to the quality of what I would consider a $70 product.
5558342	5562513	Well, and I'm sorry, that's just the world it is like, you know, the cost to go to the movies is not $70.
5562513	5566242	I mean, sometimes it is, I guess, but it is, you know.
5568118	5570060	You know what the upfront cost is there.
5570060	5570981	I don't know.
5570981	5571982	It's just ridiculous.
5571982	5580250	I get the point he's trying to make when he talks about how the development costs are 100 times higher than the Famicom era, but we're charging a very similar price for games.
5580250	5583994	There's a very convenient fact he overlooks in that whole thing.
5583994	5588538	And that is that the majority of games are now delivered either digitally, which is
5589179	5608384	zero cost or on discs which are relatively extremely low cost compared to what they were in the Famicom era which were these cartridges that were not cheap because essentially you had system parts in a cartridge or if you want to literally say the Famicom disc system still discs that were more expensive than the discs they make today.
5608384	5611225	Let's even go back further than that.
5611225	5618087	Let's go back to when I was working in the video game industry and let's talk about what it actually costs to bring a game to the market.
5618827	5632151	Yo, your average $60 price point game from Capcom would have been sold to a distributor for $48 because there has to be a margin made in there for the distributor and for retail.
5632151	5634411	So $48 for the game.
5634411	5636252	$48 is not Capcom's cost on that.
5636252	5638193	They're making a margin on that as well.
5638193	5642714	So you can take that $60 game and I would say half of that is profit.
5643374	5650819	And on top of that, you're paying, you know, before when they're talking about physical discs being brought out, you know, that there's packaging costs and stuff that went in there.
5650819	5656103	So now you're talking that they're getting more than 50% profit off of that.
5656103	5667532	Um, so yeah, it may have been more expensive, but now your cost to bring that to the customer is much less and you're making up all of that margin that now you're selling directly through these.
5667532	5667892	I mean, sure.
5667892	5669513	You're paying Sony and stuff, but it,
5670013	5676918	Well, maybe Capcom is, but now let's look at some of their peers like Ubisoft that tries to sell games direct.
5676918	5678699	They cut out the distribution too.
5678699	5683803	They become the distributor with things like, whatever the Ubisoft, it's so bad, I never use it.
5683803	5694290	Ubisoft front end is called, or, you know, we'll say the Epic Game Store and publishing Epic Games, you know, they can sell, or Valve, sure, Steam and Valve Games, you know, they self publish, right?
5694290	5697032	So, or self distribute and publish.
5697032	5697392	So it's just,
5698736	5705042	I dunno, like look, I get his point, but he's not making as big of a point as he thinks.
5705982	5707664	Like they want us to make us feel bad.
5707664	5713089	They're like, well, you guys are just really selfish and you really should be paying more for this product that you're giving us.
5713089	5717773	The problem is, though, is like, no, you know, if we don't feel like paying that price, then we're just not going to pay that price.
5717773	5718654	That's how it is.
5718654	5720836	You can charge whatever you want for you.
5720836	5724460	You can put out three fighter seven for one hundred and twenty dollars.
5724460	5725781	Go right ahead.
5725781	5727042	Doesn't mean people are going to buy it.
5727042	5730566	Some people might buy it, but that's that you you as a
5731046	5737852	as Capcom can do whatever you want, but you know, you also have to realize that not everybody's going to agree with you.
5737852	5742136	So do that as you will.
5742136	5745359	If you feel your games are worth more money, then charge more money.
5745359	5748401	But honestly, in the back end, you're already charging more money.
5748401	5755908	And for you, it's your best interest to get people in the ecosystem so they buy all that stupid battle pass and cosmetics and stuff because you want them in the door to do that.
5756708	5774719	So there is something I should point out, and this is something that's become abundantly clear to me just with looking at different tech companies in general, is that, I mean, increasing the price of a game, I'm sorry, it's gonna happen, it happens, massively increasing the cost is not the answer.
5775519	5804092	you know what the big thing is that we need the companies need to look at their infrastructure number one and if the current i mean and yeah reorganizing a business is expensive and difficult but look at the companies that haven't had uh you know that have been making profits have not had as many layoffs as some of the others and see what they're doing right you know um you know if
5805212	5820547	If you have, instead of a big hiring boom, for example, if you keep your new hires, especially, I wouldn't say force that crunch time on anybody, but hire reasonably and don't over-hire.
5821177	5825723	You know, utilize the people that you already have for for related tasks.
5825723	5833875	I mean, there are ways of keeping the costs down, of not hurting your employees and not hurting your consumers.
5833875	5838301	It's balance and people don't want to try to do something different.
5840157	5846279	Um, some great comments in our chat as to 100 Matt says if you keep upping the price at some point a bubble will burst.
5846279	5853121	You put out an $80 game that is two thirds done and buggy as hell your consumers will remember that and guess what won't buy it at full price.
5853121	5856542	And quest buster says XO primal has entered the chat.
5856542	5860904	And you know, what's interesting, I have friends that got super into XO primal because they're playing it on game pass.
5863137	5871679	SheHulk10 says, actually they could reduce executive salary and stockholder payouts and reduce the price of the games by 80%.
5871679	5877680	I love that comment.
5877680	5890423	BobbyBlackWolf with a bit of a realist perspective to that saying, reducing stockholder payouts has the consequence of the stockholders selling all their shares and the company goes out of business due to lack of funds, which is a whole other argument about
5891432	5895500	Publicly traded companies in the first place, but we don't have time for that.
5895500	5900850	What we do have time for is our next segment, which comes with it very own bumper.
5911643	5919408	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5919408	5923271	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5923271	5927714	All right, but once a month, DarkSakura does not pick a video game.
5927714	5933418	She picks a not video game in a 2023 twist to talk about instead.
5933418	5936500	So DarkSakura, what is the classic not video game of the month?
5937988	5943290	So the Classic Not Video Game Month actually has an evolved version.
5943290	5945731	I picked Mystery Date.
5945731	5953153	So Mystery Date was first of all created in 1965 with reissues in 1970, 1999, and 2005.
5953153	5953353	And
5959355	5968501	an evolved version, the 1999 version is an evolved version and I'll get to the name of that one and you'll know what it is.
5968501	5982810	So, Mystery Date is a game that was marketed from girls from 16 to 14 and it was conceived of by a guy, so of course it's very
5984692	5988437	It was conceived by a man named Marvin Glass and created by Henry Stann.
6000954	6018469	Marvin Glass & Associates, by the way, was a toy design engineering firm in Chicago, and some of the other games to their credit is Mr. Machine, Rock'em Sock'em Robots, Light Bright, Ants in the Pants, Mousetrap, Operation, Simon, and the evil Knievel stunt cycle.
6020571	6030269	So, going back, you can play with 2, 3, or 4 players, and the object of the game is to find the best date while avoiding, quote, the dud.
6031209	6044325	Right away, this game is reinforcing very terrible social stereotypes and all kinds of pretty nasty things.
6044325	6050132	So it's very problematic just right from the get-go, but not many people, I guess, thought that it was at the time.
6050673	6063425	So anyway, you have to assemble an outfit by finding three matching color-coded cards, and then you have to match the outfit of the date that's at the mystery door.
6064768	6068329	There was actually a big door in the middle of it.
6068329	6075551	So the date is revealed by spinning the door handle and opening the door on the game board.
6075551	6079752	You have five possible dates.
6079752	6085253	The formal dance date, the bowling date, the beach date, the skiing date, and the dud.
6085253	6093155	The dud is poorly dressed, wearing sloppy clothes, messy hair, and he has a beard shadow.
6096387	6105531	Honestly, that just sounds like any guy I ever went out with in the 90s, I would say, for the few that I did.
6105531	6107232	I mean, it was grunge.
6107232	6109353	I'm kidding.
6109353	6114155	In 1970s version, the bowling date was replaced by a picnic date.
6114155	6120118	So, if your outfit does not match the date behind the door, the door is closed and you continue.
6121143	6130371	So this is where we go up to the 90s, speaking of which, and its evolution.
6130371	6133773	Electronic dream phone.
6133773	6135975	Do we do we know this one?
6135975	6138037	I'll tell you a little secret about it.
6138037	6147284	The box had a a picture of a young Chris Evans on it as Tyler, the beach date.
6147284	6147845	I can see that.
6148768	6154509	Yeah, so anyway, this was like the 90s game.
6154509	6166231	You had a big ass, well, more like the phone looked like it was this big pink, and it's now playing on the thing, by the way, but this little monstrosity.
6166231	6169192	So you would have to find the hot guy.
6169192	6173192	I would have killed to have a big pink phone like that, just saying.
6173192	6175593	You had to find the hot guy who had the crush on you.
6175593	6176253	So huge.
6177451	6183476	So you use the pink phone to talk to guys to gather clues.
6183476	6189881	So it's like where someone wasn't eating, what he wasn't wearing, where he didn't like to hang out.
6189881	6196386	And then you had other ones say, I know who it is, but I'm not telling.
6196386	6197047	And yeah.
6197047	6198748	I think I played this game at one time.
6198748	6204713	I swear I went over to my sister's friend's house and we played this with the phone.
6206083	6215195	So basically you're using the process of elimination to figure out who was the crush and then you call them to confirm.
6215195	6218921	So the crush is basically...
6220388	6222670	The same person for all the players.
6222670	6227453	So the first girl who guesses it is the winner, pretty much.
6227453	6229875	Um, but I don't know.
6229875	6236160	Um, so you had, uh, guys who hung out in different places like the mall or Woodland Park.
6236160	6241143	Um, so you had, uh, a few different guys.
6241143	6246067	You had, uh, Bob, Scott, Tyler,
6247455	6250837	Gary, Dan, Spencer, Jamal.
6250837	6252578	Very 90s looking fellas.
6252578	6253599	There's some other ones.
6253599	6256560	The bowl cut, especially.
6256560	6262944	But yeah, you... Basically, it's really the evolved version of the same game.
6262944	6263924	It truly is.
6263924	6265905	I go to my grave saying so.
6265905	6269027	And that's why I picked the game that I did.
6269027	6272809	Whereas on the board game, you're rolling dice.
6272809	6275331	But the phone game, I mean, it's...
6278204	6298255	It's funny, there's a book called Timeless Toys, and they compared Mystery Date, and I'm going to quote this, it was the result of crossing Barbie in all her high fashion glory with 1965's biggest game show, Let's Make a Deal, calling it an example of simple yet ingenious quality of games that are associated with Marvin Glass.
6302542	6308786	It absolutely is problematic at its core.
6308786	6322333	The game is basically camping on stereotypes, using aesthetics as nothing but the judge of another person's quality.
6325135	6333243	I mean, honestly enough, the Mystery Phone one is, I think, better off.
6333243	6337247	Because they're all supposed to be hotties.
6337247	6338468	But that's the game.
6338468	6341211	Problematic, yes, but iconic, also yes.
6342567	6347770	Mystery Date, the classic non video game of the week.
6347770	6349311	And the mystery phone with it.
6349311	6351632	I was I was somewhat familiar with this game.
6351632	6353453	I never played it, unfortunately.
6353453	6358816	Just like I would say I wanted to play Mall Madness a lot more than my lady friends had.
6358816	6361557	I want to play Mall Madness, which you've already featured this year.
6361557	6363198	But I never did play Mystery Date.
6363198	6366960	But the way you describe it, because you're trying to kind of guess like what's in the center of the board.
6366960	6369462	It makes me think that Clue is just mystery murder.
6369462	6370222	Yeah.
6370222	6372023	Isn't Clue just mystery murder then?
6372433	6375094	Clue is Mystery Murder.
6375094	6379055	Well, I did Clue, didn't I?
6379055	6382496	Well, it came out before, well before this, though.
6382496	6383296	Yeah.
6383296	6383576	I don't know.
6383576	6384477	I'd have to check the wiki.
6384477	6385537	Like in the 40s.
6385537	6388138	Yeah.
6388138	6391179	The first manufactured version of Cluedo was in 1949.
6391179	6392139	Yeah.
6392139	6394520	OK, so.
6394520	6394920	All right.
6394920	6397221	So this game just took murder and turned it into dating.
6397221	6398521	That's fine.
6398521	6398881	All right.
6398881	6401842	What if we took the murder game and made it less murdery?
6405363	6406846	Alright, great pick.
6406846	6407827	You know what?
6407827	6411213	We could revamp this game.
6411213	6415320	And we could make it very, very, very, very gay.
6415902	6417122	No, no, no, no, no, no.
6417122	6419043	I mean, I'm of course I'm all for that.
6419043	6421043	But I think even better.
6421043	6427144	And I think something that everybody would understand would be Mystery Kitty, which which kitties which kitties at your front door?
6427144	6428324	Meow, meow, meowing.
6428324	6430925	That's that's it's Mystery Kitty would be the way to play the game.
6430925	6431585	Yeah, exactly.
6431585	6433085	You found a dead rat.
6433085	6434786	It has Black Cat fur on it.
6434786	6436646	Unfortunately, I play that game in real life.
6436646	6442207	But, you know, it's in my neighborhood is is this Black Cat Midna?
6444590	6448353	And I have to always look in the house first.
6448353	6449513	My cat's in the house.
6449513	6450414	It's not my cat.
6450414	6456938	I saw on my Facebook feed the other day, and it's a legit thing because it's legitimately on their website.
6456938	6463003	They have a spirit Halloween store themed Monopoly board.
6463003	6463363	Why?
6464452	6466012	Who's buying that?
6466012	6466653	But they have it.
6466653	6469393	I want that just for the what the fuckness of it.
6469393	6469813	They have it.
6469813	6478176	And like, it's funny, because like the first the first section of properties on the border, like abandoned mall shop, abandoned like this shop.
6478176	6483277	It's like all the different places you'd find a spirit Halloween store.
6483277	6484598	I thought it was funny.
6484598	6488459	I just never would imagine that as a thing.
6488459	6490019	But it is a thing.
6490019	6493520	What's the equivalent of Boardwalk, former former Target store in San Francisco?
6494823	6498328	Um, you know, I'll tell you what, I will look it up.
6498328	6509943	And while you do that, well, actually don't go too far, Loki, because we need you to tackle some rapid fire news for us as we travel around the gaming world and look quickly at some other headlines and things that are going on.
6511428	6518735	Alright, so we've got a surprise game announcement, actually a surprise game release.
6518735	6529766	It is called Elder Scrolls Castle, and Elder Scrolls Castle is basically an Elder Scrolls skinned version of Fallout Shelter, which, that sounds cool.
6530407	6536632	So that is a thing that is got shadow dropped on the 28th of September and you can check it out.
6536632	6539395	I think it's it's out on Google Play right now.
6539395	6544799	I'm assuming Steam as well and probably consoles at some point.
6544799	6547141	But yeah, it looks like we get the screenshots.
6547141	6554847	It's pretty much exactly Fallout Shelters, but now with Elder Scrolls, which I am down for.
6554847	6555588	I will have to check it out.
6555854	6557075	Yeah, I might check that out.
6557075	6560937	Fallout Shelter wasn't bad, but I'm not really super into the Fallout universe.
6560937	6564219	But Elder Scrolls, that I could go along with.
6564219	6568862	And then we've got five new tracks coming to F-Zero 99.
6568862	6575026	So we've got now two normal F-Zero 99, Mute City 2, Port Town 1, and Red Canyon 1.
6575026	6579509	And in the pro tracks, they have Whiteland 2 and Death Wind 2.
6579509	6585573	And apparently the Queen League will also be appearing in the Grand Prix events as well.
6586674	6588195	I still haven't played F-Zero 99.
6588195	6590255	I haven't either.
6590255	6592816	Oops, I should be supporting F-Zero.
6592816	6600359	And just be like, specifically, we're not bringing a new F-Zero game because that Rob Roberts didn't play F-Zero 99.
6600359	6602760	We had him specifically targeted for this.
6602760	6606802	And we're like, yep, we're gonna green light this game as soon as he plays.
6606802	6607582	Nothing happened.
6607582	6608262	It's me.
6608262	6609583	Hi, I'm the problem.
6609583	6609843	It's me.
6613151	6618395	Anyway, DarkSakura, how about another game I've overlooked completely that I should be playing?
6618395	6620877	Samba de Amigo!
6620877	6628303	So Samba de Amigo Party Central had two more DLC packs on the 28th and more to come.
6629203	6638568	So, um, what we have so far is the Sonic and Japan Culture ones already came out on, uh, in, uh, August.
6638568	6646132	For September, we had the Sega Music Pack and the, uh, K-Pop Pack.
6646132	6654376	And then, uh, this month, October, we're gonna have, uh, the Persona and, uh, Virtual Singer Packs.
6654376	6656738	And then two Mystery ones in November.
6657898	6664905	But the Phantom Thieves music pack will have colors flying high, life will change, and rivers in the desert.
6664905	6669949	There's the Joker and Morgana costume and accessories pack.
6669949	6676556	And the Virtual Singer pack has the vampire, phony, and goodbye declaration.
6676556	6677236	It's a day go.
6678707	6685449	To answer your question, Rob, what is in the boardwalk position on the Spirit Monopoly board?
6685449	6689031	It is unfortunately underwhelming, just like this entire board is.
6689031	6692532	It is the Spirit Halloween corporate office.
6692532	6693552	Oh.
6693552	6695053	Boo.
6695053	6696353	Exactly.
6696353	6696653	All right.
6696653	6697494	Where is that even at?
6697494	6698334	It's got to be in the L.A.
6698334	6701055	area.
6701055	6701435	I don't know.
6701435	6703676	I feel like it's on the Monopoly board.
6703676	6705757	I'm assuming it's in boardwalk.
6705757	6706057	Anyway.
6706905	6710758	Aren't those all, wasn't the original Monopoly all based off New Jersey, Atlantic City?
6710758	6711922	Isn't that what it's all based off of?
6715008	6720731	Speaking of cities and speaking of games that I'd love to play, but we know I never will, Cities Skylines 2.
6720731	6721672	That's right.
6721672	6725954	Kind of the spiritual successor in many ways to SimCity because we all saw what EA did to SimCity.
6725954	6730376	So a lot of people went to Cities Skylines, which was a pretty awesome city building sim.
6730376	6733378	And a lot of people very excited about Cities Skylines 2.
6733378	6741602	And they can continue to be excited until spring 2024 when the game will be out on the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and S. But
6742082	6746945	If you are wanting to play the PC version of the game, it is still coming out October 24th, 2023.
6746945	6750167	That's just a few weeks as it was originally planned.
6750167	6752088	So just a heads up there.
6752088	6755951	Some of the minimum and recommended PC specs have gone a little higher though.
6755951	6759573	So if you haven't looked at those lately, you might want to take a look.
6759573	6760794	There is that.
6760794	6766738	But yeah, if otherwise, if you want to check out the other versions of the games, the console versions are coming out a little bit later.
6767158	6773382	Heads up, City Skylines 2 is still coming to PC Game Pass as well, if you want to check it out that way.
6773382	6778285	It will come out to Xbox Game Pass when the console version of the game comes out.
6778285	6781487	I guess that's cool that it is on Game Pass at least.
6781487	6787771	The cost is one less barrier to getting to play that, so that's kind of cool.
6787771	6789712	So, City Skylines 2.
6789712	6794555	FifthDreamInChat says, I always play City Builders for two days, then drop off.
6795718	6803183	Huh, SSTO 100 Matt, funny enough, it is the Spirit Corporate Headquarters is in New Jersey, Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey.
6803183	6804744	How about that?
6804744	6805065	All right.
6805065	6806806	Okay.
6806806	6814471	Um, let's move on and check out some release dates, some things we're going to be playing a little sooner than the Cities Skylines 2 console release.
6814471	6816813	We'll start in the US, Loki.
6816813	6822177	We have Bilkin's Folly on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6823680	6848665	Trepang2 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Disgaea7, that's gonna be on, or Disgaea7, Vows of the Virtueless on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 Ignystone on PC, iOS, and Android Ira on PC InHisTime on PC
6850424	6855269	Scorn is coming out on PlayStation 5.
6855269	6860093	We've also got Silent Hope on PC and Nintendo Switch.
6860093	6865238	The Lamplighters League on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6865238	6869742	Blossom Tales 2, The Minotaur Prince on Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6873368	6883112	Wordless on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6883112	6887273	And Assassin's Creed Mirage, oh, was that this week?
6887273	6892575	On PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6892575	6898137	Cricket24 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6899233	6917487	Dark Pictures Anthology Little Hope on Nintendo Switch Front Mission 2 Remake on Nintendo Switch Night vs. Giant The Broken Excalibur on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series
6918292	6936306	The Sisters 2, Road to Fame on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series Sword Art Online, oh that's not for this region We've got Wargroove 2 on PC and Nintendo Switch
6938451	6957045	Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition on Nintendo Switch Detective Pikachu Returns on Nintendo Switch NHL 24 on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series Sword Art Online Last Recollection on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series
6960448	6967745	And last but not least, Sunshine Manor on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6968867	6974089	Alright, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases there, it's actually very similar to what Loki just read.
6974089	6976289	There's a lot of overlap this week between the regions.
6976289	6983032	It's not always that way, but this week we also have on the Nintendo Switch, we'll start there, Detective Pikachu Returns gets its release in Japan.
6983032	6987273	Pretty much the whole world is coming out the same day, as Nintendo games do these days.
6987273	6993295	However, also of interest, the Mario Red edition of the Switch OLED model is also out.
6993655	6997496	No, it doesn't actually have Mario on it, but it's just in the Mario red color.
6997496	6999316	So I'm trying to see if maybe it's on the dock.
6999316	7002577	I think there might be a picture of Mario on the dock.
7002577	7004758	Nope, it's just the Switch logo that's on the dock there.
7004758	7009139	So but it's it's that, you know, iconic Mario red, I guess, if anything else.
7009139	7019121	Also in repack, repackaging news, maybe as you're buying that new OLED model, you might pick up Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the booster course pass included.
7019121	7022582	That is a re-release, if you will, that is hitting the shelves in Japan this week.
7022582	7023162	I'm assuming
7023722	7033613	for the quote-unquote holiday season or I guess more appropriately end-of-year season for Japan since we all know Christmas works a little differently there.
7033613	7034974	But that's what we see on the Switch.
7034974	7042222	On the PlayStation 5, again some overlap with what we've just heard about, Assassin's Creed Mirage gets a release in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.
7042983	7055208	Sword Art Online, as Loki referred to, also released in Japan, but you know you get your limited edition and your 10th anniversary memorial limited edition on the PlayStation 5, because of course you do.
7055208	7063931	And a game called Gord is also out in Japan this week, which it looks like it's a multi-language edition of a game being brought over.
7063931	7065412	And that's it for Japan.
7065412	7066272	How about Europe, DarkSakura?
7068054	7074259	On the third for PlayStation and Xbox, we'll have Tripong2, or maybe it's Squared.
7074259	7076541	It has the two, it looks like Squared.
7076541	7079444	Scorn, Special Deluxe Edition.
7079444	7082826	For Switch, we have Silent Hope.
7082826	7086470	Also for PlayStation, Paleo Pines Dino Valley.
7087190	7091755	For Xbox and PlayStation, we have Everspace 2 Stellar Edition.
7091755	7095880	On the 4th for Xbox, we have Warhammer 40K Darktide.
7095880	7101086	On the 5th for PlayStation, Cricket 24.
7101086	7105031	We also have for PlayStation and Xbox, Assassin's Creed Mirage.
7105031	7107113	On the 6th, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition.
7108554	7109755	That's for Switch.
7109755	7113556	For PlayStation, we have Fort Solis Limited Edition.
7113556	7116358	PlayStation, Xbox, NHL 24.
7116358	7120199	For all three, Harvest Moon, The Winds of Anthos.
7120199	7124201	And then for Switch, there's Detective Pikachu Returns.
7124201	7129663	And then for Xbox and PlayStation, we have Sword Art Online, Last Recollection.
7131132	7132273	All right.
7132273	7134034	We have a few more headlines for you.
7134034	7141798	And then we will open up the phones to our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord and the green room.
7141798	7145900	We also will invite your emails participate at orangelandrater.com.
7145900	7150122	Sadly, I think we are another week with no emails, but we'll double check on that in a moment.
7150122	7152924	But in the meantime, we have some headlines.
7152924	7155765	Unless Kylie lyrics count.
7155765	7156886	I think I read that last week.
7156886	7158067	Anyway, you can actually delete that.
7158067	7158427	Okay, yeah.
7160824	7163546	Kylie lyrics always count.
7163546	7174214	In fact, the nearby establishment, The Bolt, which my friend and I go to occasionally, and we always take over the jukebox there.
7174214	7178157	For the last three months, we make it our mission to play Padam Padam every night that we're there.
7178897	7182919	And then we started putting Kylie Minogue's Tension, the single in that.
7182919	7189001	And now my favorite song on the new album, Hold On To Now, for whatever reason, that song, I don't know if that's the next single.
7189001	7190142	It probably ought to be.
7190142	7192203	But that song has now hit the jukebox too.
7192203	7193983	So now we can play that too.
7193983	7198005	So we play a lot of Kylie at the club.
7198005	7199786	But I just can't get her out of my head.
7199786	7200286	Why?
7200286	7200846	Why?
7200846	7203007	Why would we?
7203007	7204508	All right.
7204508	7204768	Anyway,
7205370	7208292	Kylie Minogue, official singer of Orange Sound Radio.
7208292	7214035	I mean, honestly, like the day she hit DDR with what song was it?
7214035	7216857	Everything.
7216857	7224821	Love at First Sight was the song that was in DDR Max 2, and that was that like countries were changed that day.
7224821	7226642	Yeah, it was only the home version, though.
7226642	7226822	It was.
7229449	7254647	over to the actual human wasn't locomotion like a really throwback wasn't that in one of the euro stage fixes like way back when I feel like it was uh maybe yeah anyway all right enough DDR reminiscing let's look forward to the future because this is some interest especially with all the shit talking on executives I've been doing tonight this is some interesting news isn't it Loki
7255424	7262745	Yeah, Jim Ryan, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO, is retiring after four years on the job.
7262745	7269267	After 30 years, I've made the decision to retire from SIE in March of 2024.
7269267	7277008	I've relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners.
7277008	7282269	But I found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America.
7282269	7283970	Understandable, I guess.
7283970	7284950	That is a heck of a commute.
7286886	7288467	Yep.
7288467	7293292	That's why Ryan Seacrest quit live with Ryan and Kelly for the record.
7293292	7295434	Very similar reason.
7295434	7298697	He couldn't stand the commute.
7298697	7301840	Important stuff.
7301840	7303261	All right.
7303261	7304462	Let's see.
7304462	7304883	Yeah.
7304883	7308827	I don't know who's going to be taking over then, or I'm sure they'll probably have to, you know,
7309633	7311437	Figure that out, but that's interesting.
7311437	7316727	It'd be interesting to see who's gonna head up Sony and what that means for the PlayStation.
7318280	7328169	you know, I feel like things have been a little bit down on PlayStation front this generation not to I mean, the PS5 still selling like in that ultimately is the only thing that fucking matters.
7328169	7329390	So you know, it is what it is.
7329390	7340521	But let's not forget just recently, we had like, please let's not forget the price of PlayStation Plus went up extremely by a lot for literally no reason.
7340521	7341682	And that is, you know,
7341882	7345645	It's because games cost a hundred times more than what they used to.
7345645	7348347	And you guys need to pay more to play those games.
7348347	7350488	And PlayStation Now, don't forget that.
7350488	7353731	That is some of the PR mess that has been bungled a little bit lately.
7353731	7356693	But like, look, I get Jim Ryan's reason.
7356693	7359655	And, you know, it's at some point people want to retire.
7359655	7360616	I get it.
7360616	7366660	So it's, you know, I don't think you can directly say, oh, it's because of all this negativity that he's retiring now.
7366660	7368141	Nah, it probably has nothing to do with that.
7368361	7369702	It's but it's still interesting.
7369702	7381186	He doesn't want to whoever the new leader is has to kind of bear that responsibility to, you know, make make Sony popular and fun with the kids again, I suppose.
7381186	7386088	So it's a good thing to know when to retire and not just to hold on to the job until you literally drop dead.
7386907	7392030	Now, as Joe and Matt does point out, Hiroki, Totoki will be the interim, but that's just interim.
7392030	7393431	We don't know if that will be permanent.
7393431	7398555	So there's a fair point because I want to say Nintendo had an interim person too.
7398555	7404539	So, you know, when Iwata passed, so, you know, it's just the ebbs and flows of all this stuff.
7405539	7408962	By the way, very important update on something we were talking about.
7408962	7414327	Orange Wright says The Locomotion by Kylie Minogue was in Dance Maniacs.
7414327	7415988	It was and it was a cover.
7415988	7417549	So it was still The Locomotion, but it was a cover.
7417549	7419050	That's not which to be fair, I think.
7419050	7420572	Well, it was hers as a cover.
7420572	7423134	It was an old, old song from like the 50s.
7423134	7426236	So I think or was it Kylie's version that was in that game?
7426236	7426737	I don't know.
7426737	7427958	Orange Wright, clarify.
7429326	7429546	and a
7451666	7453828	Oh, Orange Right says it was a bass cover.
7453828	7459712	Remember how Dance Maniacs took a lot from the bass series as did the actual DDR solo bass and all that.
7459712	7461773	So I get it.
7461773	7462554	All right.
7462554	7463114	Good to know.
7463114	7465416	But yeah, that song actually predates Kylie.
7465416	7469879	So oh, well, but we still associate her with it.
7469879	7470299	All right.
7470299	7472961	Anyhow, on to some other news.
7472961	7473742	Kind of sad.
7473742	7474122	DarkSakura.
7475798	7476779	Yeah.
7476779	7486205	So, um, basically, uh, character designer behind, uh, Shining Force and Landstalker, uh, Tamaki Yoshitaka has, uh, died.
7486205	7490528	Um, he was 55 years old and he died in July of this year.
7490528	7492969	We're just finding out, um, of cancer.
7492969	7495191	So rest in peace.
7495191	7502796	He did stuff like, not just those, but also Timestalkers and actually a bunch of the Shining Force games.
7502796	7504517	So, yeah.
7505238	7506419	Well, that's sad.
7506419	7517553	That's also sad that we've gone so long without hearing but I understand at some point people retire out of video games to their private life and you know, sometimes takes word for or time for word to get around.
7517553	7523260	So I mean, it just seems to be like a
7527075	7532860	DarkTutsi in chat says, I did play The Shining Force on Sega CD.
7532860	7538526	So some memories there, some fond memories about some of the games that he was involved with.
7538526	7544772	All right, moving on to some other not great news out of Sega of a different sort, Loki.
7545565	7548688	Yeah, it's more cancellation news.
7548688	7550309	Yay.
7550309	7556834	So SIG has canceled a game called Hyenas, which I literally forgot about.
7556834	7561138	I was not aware of what this even was.
7561138	7565761	Apparently, it's a sci-fi space piracy multiplayer FPS.
7565761	7567102	Oh, OK.
7567102	7573888	And yeah, so it was like a PvE type thing or PvP, that type of thing.
7575072	7584714	Apparently, though, they said that on September 11th, this is the game wrapped up its most recent betas, and apparently they've confirmed it's canceled.
7584714	7589116	So let's see.
7589116	7594717	We are so sorry to announce the end of Hyena's development before we even bring out the full version to you.
7594717	7601599	While the decision to cancel the project has not been made lightly, we know that this doesn't make it easier for you to accept.
7601599	7602559	And of course, they don't say why.
7605452	7608434	Oh, well, I mean, that sucks.
7608434	7620264	And along with that, though, of course, Creative Assembly has announced that, or they had made an announcement, I think, of layoffs.
7620957	7633243	So we've made a decision to begin our redundancy consultation process in some of our areas of UK operations alongside any development of hyenas.
7633243	7636925	This may unfortunately result in job losses.
7636925	7645090	We fully understand that this has a significant impact on our people and whether or not they are affected or not, which we are truly sorry.
7648263	7665267	Yeah, they're going to try to relocate anybody whose roles they can relocate to equivalent positions, I guess, in California to minimize any job losses, but there still will probably be job losses.
7665267	7666967	Unfortunate.
7666967	7667807	Yeah.
7667807	7670508	So why was Hyenas cancelled?
7670508	7671288	Let's see here.
7671717	7675320	I don't think like it had recently done a play test, hadn't it?
7675320	7677703	I guess the reaction must have been really bad.
7677703	7688613	Yeah, they're saying that economic downturn due to inflation and because of COVID-19 in response, a lower profitability in the European region.
7688613	7696280	We have reviewed our title portfolio of each of these development base in Europe and resulting actions was cancel hangings.
7697788	7703971	Like, how far do we have to get from COVID-19 before we can stop blaming COVID-19 for some of this?
7703971	7708914	I guess, I mean, technically, if you think about it, a game like that could have been developed for a few years.
7708914	7710795	So that would have been during the pandemic.
7710795	7717058	But like, we're kind of getting out of like, away from 2020 a bit.
7717058	7721781	And I get it that the pandemic happened for a few years, but like, I don't know.
7721781	7726443	I'm like, I'm kind of ready to stop blaming COVID and just start blaming like,
7727292	7730114	Yeah, we done didn't plan that correctly.
7730114	7735998	Yeah, well, our leadership just they just made some dumb decisions, you know.
7735998	7737759	I just don't think it's profitable.
7737759	7742802	Quest Buster in our chat points out Creative Assembly was about to release Total War Pharaoh later this month, too.
7742802	7744884	So.
7744884	7745224	Bummer.
7745224	7745244	I.
7747815	7753278	For the last story I have on the show tonight, this is one of those things where it's like, this is just so wild, I had to bring it up.
7753278	7763125	It's not directly about video games, but it lives on a parallel line with DarkSakura doing her little twist of classic non-video game of the month.
7763125	7769849	Because one of those non-video games I think would be very easy to pick if she didn't already, I don't have a list in front of me, but I don't think she did Pictionary yet.
7770850	7772532	And this last story is about Pictionary.
7772532	7776577	Of course, you all know Pictionary, the legendary board game where you're drawing things.
7776577	7778820	It's like win, lose, or draw as a board game, right?
7778820	7781003	You're trying to draw things people guess, right?
7781003	7784307	Well, how about this new version of Pictionary?
7784307	7787411	Mattel announces Pictionary AI.
7789814	7791435	No, let's just marinate on that for a sec.
7791435	7795236	But actually, here's the guess what I tried to create.
7795236	7796516	OK, but here's the wild thing.
7796516	7805359	When I say Pictionary AI, your brains probably all go to a specific place of like, oh, it's going to try to draw things that you get.
7805359	7807580	That's actually not what it is.
7807580	7810241	It's actually the literal opposite of that.
7810241	7815003	Let me explain what Pictionary AI is or as Pictionary versus AI specifically.
7815838	7820044	What it's doing is it's incorporating AI technology.
7820044	7821166	It's not a video game.
7821992	7828437	But it's an analog board game with an app, an AI enhanced refresh is what they're calling it.
7828437	7833240	So what happens, you are trying to stump artificial intelligence.
7833240	7840025	You get a clue from a card, and you draw on the included whiteboard, just like in the regular game.
7840025	7847410	And then the drawing is sent to a smartphone, where it is analyzed by the AI and the algorithm attempts to guess what you drew.
7848515	7864615	everyone else tries to guess is the AI gonna get it or not and then you make your predictions after seeing the drawings and of course Mattel is saying that's gonna lead to hilarious fun and laughter are sure to ensure with all drawings good and bad
7866090	7879116	I'm not going to contribute to any AI learning about other art and stealing it, nor how to analyze it for basically, I'm not going to pay to contribute to another system's machine learning.
7879116	7881637	And I don't think anyone should buy this game, quite frankly.
7881637	7884898	But this is this is where these things are going.
7884898	7894042	And what actually I have to admit, what shocked me about this was I was going, oh, God, you know, this is it's it's not technically a board game, but they're still they're going to charge people 50 bucks for it.
7894642	7902489	What is interesting, it's only 25 bucks, which for as much as they're touting all this cutting edge technology stuff seems kind of cheap.
7902489	7909275	But DarkSakura, I think you I think you just said the more dark sided part of this.
7909275	7910316	Hmm.
7910316	7912098	Nothing's cheap.
7912098	7912678	What's this thing?
7912678	7914340	Nothing is free.
7914340	7920285	You're either you're paying for something in one way or another, whether it's that whether it's time.
7920923	7925364	the price of the meta quest going up after they severed the Facebook connection and that whole thing.
7925364	7935227	$25 will get you four whiteboards, a smartphone stand, a game board, game pieces, some pens, and a stack of clue cards.
7935227	7936968	You know what, y'all?
7936968	7939129	You could just go on the internet.
7939129	7941009	Look up some Pictionary clues.
7941009	7947171	Ironically, you know what you could even if you really wanted to, you could go to chat GPT and say give me some good Pictionary prompts.
7947171	7949732	And then you could get some pen and paper and play this game with your friends.
7950805	7971093	no no further AI needed pretty much that I don't know I don't know why this just struck me is so shocking like it is and it isn't like you know people trying to leverage AI in weird ass fucking ways that isn't surprising to me but it's just like pictionary a board game
7972395	7975176	And like the, it doesn't even sound set up the right way.
7975176	7982178	Like I would have thought, oh, it's like, you know, go back to something like anticipation, if you will, where it would draw the clue.
7982178	7983098	That's actually legit.
7983098	7986599	One of my favorite NES games, Anticipation, where it would draw the clue, right?
7986599	7989019	And then you buzz in, but it wasn't AI that powered that.
7989019	7995661	All those drawings were scripted, you know, and you play the game enough and you can guess things based on the first couple of lines that are drawn.
7995661	7998022	And that's why nobody wanted to play that game with me at a certain point.
7998582	8004744	But I, I, I would have thought Pictionary AI meant the game is drawing it.
8004744	8008805	But I didn't, when I first read this story, I didn't.
8008805	8011946	Even if it was that way, it'd still be contributing to things we don't want to support.
8011946	8017247	Yeah, but I, I know, but I didn't even think about that darker element of it until I'm reading it here.
8017247	8022589	And you said that about, well, they're doing it this way because now you're going to be teaching the AI for future versions of the game.
8022589	8026250	Like it's just, wow.
8026250	8026410	Yeah.
8026895	8030017	We're going to have you train our AI and you're going to pay for it.
8030017	8032178	Win, win, win, win.
8032178	8036861	Think, think about, think about what you buy for the laughs.
8036861	8038902	Anyway.
8038902	8039342	All right.
8039342	8043064	On that scary note, let's go to, wow, it is spooky season, isn't it?
8043064	8045526	Happy Halloween.
8045526	8047727	All right, let's, let's, let's go.
8047727	8052470	Who needs serial killers when you have, you know, then again, I mean,
8053793	8057714	I was watching Alien earlier.
8057714	8058914	Of course, of course you were.
8058914	8060935	Mother.
8060935	8071817	An SSJ100 Matt, by the way, is saying that I am pronouncing the, of course, I'm pronouncing word wrong, words wrong yet again here on Originals Radio, that I am pronouncing the name of that game on the NES incorrectly.
8071817	8080619	The correct way to pronounce the drawing game with the ice cream cone and the high heel as tokens on the game board is Antissa.
8080619	8081819	Patience.
8081819	8082139	Say it.
8084346	8090589	because after all it is Halloween and spooky season officially.
8090589	8093850	Did you all get out your Tim Curry memes today?
8093850	8096371	Did you all get out your Tim Curry memes because it is October 1st?
8096371	8099313	My entire life is a Tim Curry meme, Rob.
8099313	8105816	It is, but it is, it is, you know, it's the day for the Tim Curry meme where it is September 30th.
8105816	8106356	That's right.
8106356	8108818	You're that Tim Curry, Wadsworth from Clue, but October 1st.
8110517	8111277	You're Frank.
8111277	8112798	You're Frank Inverter.
8112798	8114638	It's spooky season.
8114638	8116119	Or you're Satan.
8116119	8116659	That's right.
8116659	8118940	Or you're Pennywise.
8118940	8122561	Or you're the Grand Witch.
8122561	8127842	Anything can happen on Halloween.
8127842	8128122	Anyway.
8132650	8134191	Uh, where the hell do I go with this show?
8134191	8134611	Oh, yes.
8134611	8135872	I'm a butler.
8135872	8136893	I buttle.
8136893	8141635	If you do not, do not devolve this show into quoting the movie Clue.
8141635	8145137	It will go on for another 90 minutes because I will quote the entire movie.
8151642	8156883	Anyway, uh, you can call in if you want, uh, vognetwork.com slash discord.
8156883	8162225	We can also take your questions in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
8162225	8172668	Um, we'll take your clue quotes too, or, uh, we'll take your emails, except I don't think we got any, uh, at participate at orange lounge radio.com and QuestBusters.
8172668	8174188	Can I quote another movie?
8174188	8174388	Sure.
8175087	8176689	We ain't got shit.
8176689	8177089	Oh, yeah.
8177089	8178650	Oh, I'll paraphrase.
8178650	8186857	Sacramento born, I think, Sacramento raised anyway, Tim Russ, who went on to play Tupac, the guy that can't find shit in the desert.
8186857	8194004	I and you I feel like he gets comments on both equally.
8194004	8202151	Some people love him as Tupac, some people love him as the guy in Spaceballs that can't find shit.
8202151	8203352	Loki, do we have any last minute news?
8204852	8206533	He don't.
8206533	8208055	Oh, he don't.
8208055	8208635	I looked.
8208635	8210016	That's unfortunate.
8210016	8213639	Ranma's trying to say that he sent a last minute email.
8213639	8214800	I already closed the email.
8214800	8215080	Hold on.
8215080	8218203	Yeah, I haven't seen it come through because they all get forwarded to my personal box.
8218203	8219484	I haven't seen it yet.
8219484	8221105	Did it go to spam?
8221105	8224367	Well, I don't I don't do any forwarding.
8224367	8226009	I just go right to the email.
8226009	8228851	No, I. And no, there's nothing.
8228851	8230372	OK.
8230372	8230813	In the junk.
8230813	8233675	I did find something interesting as and I noticed.
8235061	8236522	Oh, go ahead.
8236522	8237744	No, keep going.
8237744	8247593	Oh, I was just saying while I was trying to search to see if what what DDR Euromix had on it, because I thought there may have been more Kylie Minogue stuff.
8247593	8249615	That was the legendary song in that game.
8249615	8251737	Yeah, that game was awesome.
8251737	8254199	Or that song was awesome in that game.
8254199	8260045	But apparently there was a TV show called Dance Revolution that was based off a DDR that was on TV.
8260910	8261790	I remember that.
8261790	8263331	I remember we covered it.
8263331	8264951	I mean, yeah, I'm sure we covered it.
8264951	8268332	I just completely slipped my mind that that was a thing.
8268332	8271473	I remember us covering the porno Dance Dance Fuck.
8271473	8273654	I remember that.
8273654	8275234	Hey, we are not.
8275234	8276875	If we're anything, we are thorough.
8276875	8278655	That's for sure.
8278655	8281696	Do you remember me finally hunting down Final Fuck X?
8281696	8283617	Yeah, that was it was like it was like a combo.
8283617	8286598	We did Final Fuck X and we did Dance Dance Fuck.
8286598	8289619	And then I think there was wasn't there another one?
8289619	8290239	I don't know.
8290239	8290619	I don't know.
8293074	8296336	And for the record, in Final Fuck X, only the women dress up.
8296336	8300258	And then, like, it's for five seconds, and then they're not wearing anything anymore.
8300258	8302440	So it's... Well, I'm just surprised.
8302440	8304561	It's fanboys fucking cosplayers.
8304561	8308903	I'm just surprised that that movie, the FC, got a total of four movies.
8308903	8310765	I didn't realize there were three sequels to that.
8310765	8313146	I knew there was like a couple sequels to it, but four?
8313146	8315087	That's a lot.
8315087	8316848	Who knew?
8316848	8318129	All right.
8318129	8321251	Well, I guess with that... Oh, we have an email, DarkSakura.
8321251	8321471	Yeah.
8322791	8324072	Greetings, everyone.
8324072	8327055	I am glad there was a brief chat on 25 years of DDR.
8327055	8332279	I was hoping that maybe there would be what would have been a list list for favorite DDR songs.
8332279	8336102	But instead, I have three questions for everyone, along with my answers.
8336102	8338864	Five favorite DDR songs.
8338864	8348372	So Ranma suggests My Sweet Darling, Tsukaru, Candy, Trust DDR Mix, and Dance Dance Revolution by DDR All Stars.
8350694	8355217	I will go with Superstar.
8355217	8362922	Because, you know, that was like my warm up song.
8362922	8374429	Brilliant Tea Orchestra Mix, still one of my favorites to this day.
8374429	8377131	Burning Heat, that made it into DDR, right?
8377131	8378572	Yes, it did.
8380561	8385682	and, um... Also, didn't the other Gradius mix make it in there?
8385682	8386783	No, it didn't.
8386783	8388643	It was just pretty weak.
8388643	8391704	The Gyruss mix was in there.
8391704	8392264	In the Xbox.
8392264	8394965	Yeah, I actually really like the Gyruss mix.
8394965	8401146	And, um... Uh... My Baby Mama.
8401146	8402406	Ha!
8402406	8409528	Um... Who is My Baby... Yeah, it was My Baby, because... You know there was a parody of a song called My Baby Daddy?
8410032	8412493	Yeah, no, I know.
8412493	8417875	My five would be, and also I want to point out on the listless thing, a couple issues with the listless thing.
8417875	8421277	Since we do this show virtually, we don't really have guests in studio at this point.
8421277	8423738	We don't really have that kind of part.
8423738	8431041	And then the voting technology that we used to have through vognetwork.com because people can't sign up for VOG Network anymore.
8431041	8433842	We can't allow new people to vote on answers ultimately.
8433842	8436604	So we kind of faded the listless thing a little bit.
8436604	8438144	I'm not going to say it's never going to come back.
8438144	8439305	We may do it, you know.
8440100	8443302	but we can have people vote in Twitch.
8443302	8447184	Uh, don't you have to put a set extension for that?
8447184	8450505	No, it's just built in through the control panel.
8450505	8451766	Oh, okay.
8451766	8454307	I'll have to look into it because I don't I don't ever run polls on there.
8454307	8455868	But I'll look into it.
8455868	8457129	But I can't do it right now.
8457129	8458749	So so later.
8458749	8461711	Um, five songs for me that I can do right now.
8461711	8463312	I'm just gonna go off top of my head.
8463312	8465473	Oh, Nick, please not so quick.
8465473	8469455	Ghosts, Skulk.
8469455	8469555	Um,
8472155	8481057	I'm Alive, the uplifting one because there was two I'm Alive so I'm Alive, I'm Alive, that one and then Together Forever by Captain Jack.
8481057	8483858	Those would be my five.
8483858	8484198	Loki?
8484198	8487619	If I pick five songs, oh gosh.
8487619	8490960	Um, I would say Look to the Sky.
8490960	8494161	Oh, that's a good one.
8494161	8499182	God, there's Moving On from Fifth Mix.
8502683	8504944	There's a lot of stuff I played.
8504944	8511765	There's like a whole bunch of stuff that I played that was, I think, in the home version folder in Xtreme.
8511765	8512825	So, like, look those guys.
8512825	8519647	I'd say, like, Kind Lady, even... Oh, what else?
8519647	8521927	Kind Lady, So in Love.
8521927	8525608	I used to like that one quite a bit.
8525608	8526288	Oh, which was that?
8526288	8528429	What was the tutorial song that was really catchy?
8530185	8534287	Okay, I also do have to add the Silent Hill.
8534287	8537448	Tonight is, you know.
8537448	8540910	Oh, remember the dance mix that was in Extreme US?
8540910	8542811	We debuted that on OLR.
8542811	8543151	Remember that?
8543151	8547613	Yeah, but I still liked the original one.
8547613	8551275	And even though it wasn't a mix, I played a lot.
8551275	8552756	Yeah, start to tune out Simple Barber.
8552756	8553136	That was it.
8553136	8554156	Thank you.
8554156	8556818	Yeah, Simple Barber.
8556818	8557578	You got to move it.
8558064	8560948	I like that song, but I didn't like any of the cuts.
8560948	8570040	I like the one that came on the soundtrack that they gave us for Supernova, but not any of the ones that ended up in the games, unfortunately.
8572507	8581493	I didn't have enough Xbox because obviously Skulk I always put like the entire song list for DDR Ultimix 2 and 3 were like bangers like I am gothic.
8581493	8585095	I like there's just there's so many good songs in those mixes that were really overlooked.
8585095	8585655	I'm so sad.
8585655	8586976	Anything but MIDI head.
8586976	8587996	Yeah, I'm so sad.
8587996	8589938	They're not backwards compatible.
8589938	8590918	Bummer.
8590918	8591719	Anyway, sorry.
8591719	8592319	Back to email.
8592319	8592999	Right.
8592999	8594540	So next question.
8594540	8598623	First difficult song you passed and that for Ranma was Freckles.
8600595	8601096	Ryan78 was slow.
8623385	8624446	Oh, I know what mine was.
8624446	8626326	It was My Summer Love.
8626326	8627307	Oh, that's right.
8627307	8628187	Yeah, yeah, that one.
8628187	8648216	But it was it was the slow Orion 78 mix that where the I still remember to this day, the feet pattern was bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bu
8654297	8656538	Hmm.
8656538	8658659	So Loki, did you answer?
8658659	8659639	Yes.
8659639	8660499	Oh, oh, song.
8660499	8662660	I'm sorry.
8662660	8665561	The first nine letter.
8665561	8666161	I don't remember.
8666161	8669002	I think it was.
8669002	8674744	I don't know if it was like the original Paranoia.
8674744	8680546	Oh, I think the original was only an eight, but it's still like maybe it's maybe it's La Senorita.
8680546	8682327	I don't remember is something.
8683717	8684097	Dynamite Rave
8714945	8720947	So one song you heard on the radio or streaming that you want to see in DDR.
8720947	8726688	And that's Tower of Flower, the ending theme from like, like Chorus Recoil.
8726688	8733150	I've got this answer because I just said something about this earlier, too.
8733150	8739391	It would be Vibrancy from Violet.
8739391	8740952	She's a fantastic
8742800	8744761	What's the genre?
8744761	8748924	Horror synth, dark synth, synth metal producer.
8748924	8750485	Cool.
8750485	8751585	It's a very DDR song.
8751585	8753987	Look it up on Spotify.
8753987	8757429	I will just default to Kylie and say Say Something.
8757429	8758950	My favorite Kylie song.
8758950	8767115	I would probably, actually, I really kind of want to dance to this, and that would be Pink Venom by Blackpink.
8767115	8770917	Because, I don't know, I'm just down for that, or The Girls by Blackpink.
8772028	8772588	You know what?
8772588	8783156	I know it's sacrilegious to change my answer away from Kylie, but I'm going to because I just feel like if we're gonna go cheese, let's go full on cheese and let's get Gaga in DDR already.
8783156	8784097	And let's just go.
8784097	8785057	Let's just go right for it.
8785057	8787099	Let's get Bad Romance in DDR.
8787099	8792323	I thought Gaga was in DDR already.
8792323	8793944	In rock band.
8793944	8796145	I haven't followed the series in a long time.
8796145	8799568	No, I'm pretty sure she's in DDR because I want to say
8801288	8806849	Besides that, you know what I think would be a better song than Bad Romance to dance to?
8806849	8809070	It would actually be Shiza.
8809070	8809890	That's a good song.
8809890	8815311	I thought you might say Dance in the Dark, which is a great song that was never a single.
8815311	8818752	Shiza's my angry driving music.
8818752	8821432	Oh, DJRamaS says Bad Romance was in DDR for 360.
8821432	8822152	Well, shut me up.
8822152	8823033	I forgot about that one.
8823033	8826053	I just think that Bad Romance would be too slow.
8826053	8828814	Yeah, but it's like one of the quintessential Gaga songs, you know?
8828814	8829234	I don't know.
8829234	8829454	Anyway.
8829885	8831506	Fine, I'll go back to my original Kylie answer.
8831506	8832426	I should have never left you, Kylie.
8832426	8835188	Born This Way would probably be.
8835188	8835668	All right.
8835668	8843612	Oh, God, if I had a Kylie song, though, I would want to do I Love It.
8843612	8845754	I can also see the actual song Dancing by Kylie.
8845754	8846354	It would be a great.
8847329	8847829	Yeah.
8847829	8848890	Anyway, anyway.
8848890	8852071	OK, so the email ends.
8852071	8853051	Thanks for reading my email.
8853051	8854691	See you on the flip side.
8854691	8861054	DJ Ranma S. Thanks for the memories, DJ Ranma S. Which is not a song I said I would want to see in DDR, but I guess I could.
8861054	8865755	How about thanks for the memories, because it's Halloween-y.
8865755	8866195	All right.
8866195	8868496	Well, if you want to send us- Oh, you know what needs to be in DDR?
8868496	8869896	Hmm.
8869896	8872757	Radiscal and Devil Doll.
8872757	8874518	I am the Radiscal.
8875495	8876336	Megalovania, Homestuck
8897834	8899276	All right.
8899276	8901678	With all that, we're gonna wrap up the show.
8901678	8905402	Hey, we would love to hear your DDR memories for next week if you want to send us an email.
8905402	8910067	If you're looking for a reason to send us an email, I think some DDR memory lane stuff would be a great one.
8910067	8915653	You don't have to give us five songs, maybe give us like your one song that just makes you really happy from the DDR perspective.
8916695	8920459	But with all of that, we are going to start to wrap up the show.
8920459	8924443	I want to thank everybody for listening to Orange Launch Radio and participating with the show tonight.
8924443	8927286	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two.
8927286	8932852	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, you know, we don't always have the voices to put out here on air.
8933272	8934994	So tell a friend or two, help us spread the word.
8934994	8940180	A nice 5-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify, which I think finally has a ranking for us.
8940180	8943103	Enough of you have ranked us as Spotify, so thank you.
8943103	8943864	Appreciate that.
8943864	8947347	And 5-star reviews there go a long way, so thank you for all of that.
8947347	8949249	Really appreciate that.
8949249	8951352	Jamie, we lost your VTuber, but I think you're still with us?
8953798	8954318	I am.
8954318	8959240	I just went ahead and started switching over so I could, you know, go to the bathroom.
8959240	8959940	Yeah, fair enough.
8959940	8962221	So do you have a final thought for us tonight?
8962221	8965742	Because I know you're going to do your streaming and thing, which we haven't seen you in a couple of weeks.
8965742	8967683	So we'll see you.
8967683	8969104	See you tonight.
8969104	8972185	Actually, I may be playing with some friends.
8972185	8978827	You know, like I said, I'm in my new nurse era, but I'm going to be playing with a couple of friends that I don't often get to play with.
8978827	8979987	So I'll be happy.
8979987	8980548	All right.
8980548	8981088	Have fun.
8981088	8981688	We'll see you in a minute.
8982803	8985665	All right, have fun swimming the castle.
8985665	8987567	Do you think it'll work?
8987567	8988768	It'll take a miracle.
8988768	8989869	Bye.
8989869	8991430	Bye.
8991430	8996314	I always forget it's Carol Kane that played that part, too, who is amazing, by the way.
8996314	8998276	Anyway, let's go to Loki.
8998276	9000138	Why is my camera bigger in this shot?
9000138	9003240	I swear I'm going to just nuke all these OLR shots and make new ones.
9003240	9005122	We're going to get a makeover in a few weeks.
9005122	9008625	All right, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9008625	9010867	I don't want to go back to work.
9010867	9011067	Mood.
9011910	9020616	Um, my final thought for tonight is, uh, I'm going to continue Pokemon, uh, Scarlet on my personal channel with Shane, Pokemon Gen 9 on Monday.
9020616	9027921	We did our first, uh, we did kind of like an hour and a half that's on my YouTube channel, because you have to kind of get to a certain point before you can play multiplayer.
9027921	9037508	And now we're playing multiplayer and we, we, we didn't even get to like the first gym or anything, but because it's open world, we were running around catching so much.
9037508	9038189	So like,
9038969	9045235	We did a good, like, three-hour stream on Monday and got the decks to probably, like, 30 Pokemon, if not more.
9045235	9047877	Yeah, we're just catching different Pokemon out there in the open world.
9047877	9052321	So, and then, you know, we'll go probably tomorrow to take on the first gym or something.
9052321	9054422	I don't know what order we're going to do things, but we'll figure it out.
9054422	9057986	So that will be on my personal channel over at Rob Roberts.
9057986	9061769	And I want to make sure I also shout out VOG Network on YouTube.
9061769	9065332	I did not bring it up tonight otherwise, but we did a video, speaking of Shane,
9065672	9067694	talking about Monster Hunter now.
9067694	9070136	We just did that, and we posted that over on YouTube.
9070136	9071537	So please check that out.
9071537	9076842	And thumbs up, nice ratings, like, share, comment, subscribe, all that good stuff.
9076842	9077923	Help us out.
9077923	9078283	All right.
9078283	9080205	That is going to do it for another episode of Orange Science Radio.
9080205	9084849	Thank you so much to everybody for watching tonight or listening on the podcast feed.
9084849	9086450	We appreciate you all.
9086450	9091215	Have a wonderful week gaming, and let's... God, maybe things can stay calm this week.
9091755	9095597	because I'm with with Microsoft having a leak two weeks ago.
9095597	9098038	Sony had a hack this week.
9098038	9100340	My Nintendo, you're on notice.
9100340	9101240	Look out.
9101240	9103782	They're coming for you.
9103782	9105022	In all seriousness, take care, everybody.
9105022	9105923	We'll see you in seven days.
9105923	9107384	Bye.
