10026	14647	you get when you take a Lil Nas X fan hearing about the Red Cross' warning of a low supply of donated blood?
14647	16448	A custom PC from Blizzard!
16448	26151	Moving away from grease and hypertension, Blizzard is incentivizing the donation of blood by offering in-game loot and a chance at a custom PC build infused with human blood, whose blood has not been stated.
26151	27551	I see you, Hemantapages.
27551	29432	This is the Sanguinarian-friendly intro.
29432	36554	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38951	40933	Hello, my friends.
40933	45737	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45737	55725	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back once again here on October the 29th, 2023 for episode number 979 of our show.
55725	57426	We're back after a week off.
57426	59908	I'm sure we'll talk plenty about that in just a moment.
59908	61590	But first, let's introduce ourselves.
61590	67695	I am Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week, as well as my co-host, first off, DarkSakura, or Jamie Somers.
68757	71099	Not every gamer has all their voice.
71099	72340	Yeah, right.
72340	76824	I'm very Kathleen Turner today after hosting Rocky Horror last night.
76824	78806	It's screaming at the top of my lungs.
78806	84791	Unfortunately, I believe you picked up some sort of thing in Vegas.
84791	85492	I didn't.
85492	86633	I didn't catch anything.
86633	89195	I just have a sinus infection since they're not contagious.
90897	96544	I get a sinus infection a couple of times a year and I was due.
96544	102772	Just the being around things I'm allergic to and all kinds of stuff just happened.
102772	105135	Well, we have a lot to talk about with the convention.
105135	108919	But before we do that, let me make sure I introduce Techmaster Loki as well.
108919	109320	Hey, Loki.
111226	112186	Hey, how's it going?
112186	113107	It is going well.
113107	124691	Ooh, a classic playing behind you tonight, I see, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show, if you want to see us.
124691	126011	But, you know, we're still a podcast.
126011	126972	We focus on the audio.
126972	131993	But I can't help but notice when Loki has an awesome game that I recognize playing behind him.
131993	135134	And tonight is Symphony of the Night, one of the all time greats.
135134	137315	Is this is this a Halloween themed selection?
137315	138015	Of course.
138015	139336	Of course, it's a Halloween theme.
140185	145909	I wasn't sure if, you know, if it was for the for the holidays or what have you.
145909	148771	Your words are as empty as a soul.
148771	151613	Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.
151613	155876	Oh man, the PlayStation 1 had such great voice acting.
155876	157097	Truly an era.
157097	159339	Between this game, Resident Evil.
159339	161581	I mean, there's there's a lot of games we could talk about.
161581	163882	Don't open that door.
163882	165363	You don't want to end up in a jail sandwich.
165363	167485	I hope this is not Chris's blood.
169233	179548	Uh, Loki, I feel like out of any of us, if anyone ran to see the Five Nights at Freddy's movie this weekend, it was you, because the kid, did you go to see this Five Nights at Freddy's movie?
179548	180610	Which apparently is doing very well.
181454	184618	I did not go to see it.
184618	188062	I watched it at home because it is on streaming.
188062	189904	Okay, yes, I knew it was on Peacock as well.
189904	191605	Okay, so how was it?
191605	194429	Because I don't follow the games as closely as I think I do.
194429	195390	I don't either.
195390	196151	Okay, that's fine.
196151	198693	Like I know who some of the characters are.
198693	199494	I liked it.
199494	202177	It is not a scary movie.
202978	210141	So it is certainly geared towards a younger audience, which is what they, you know, it's PG-13, right?
210141	215284	There is violence, but it's like not like a lot of it's off screen.
215284	219406	A lot of it is like very like kind of, oh, it's in the dark over there.
219406	222267	There's like not a lot of gore and stuff.
222267	227629	I'm hoping that there's a director's cut that comes out at some point, you know, for it, because I think that would be good.
227629	228970	I thought it was okay.
228970	229870	Megan was PG-13 as well.
231531	241462	Yeah, but Megan was like, all of it was like CG blood that they added in there, and I guess that's fine.
241462	245747	It was a little weird in parts, I guess, like it kind of goes like...
247621	274573	it almost is like fun time like it like it it kind of like oh hey we forgot we're a horror movie for a while you know and that type of thing um it definitely looks like it's like a fan delivery thing because it's really funny you look at the you know Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic whatever and it's like the critics they don't like it at all but the fans they seem to care they seem to like it a lot more which i mean to be fair it's a horror movie like what critics like horror movies and stuff like that and that's fine like
274813	286997	Did you know that the 10th Saw movie, the 10th Saw movie, which is a franchise I don't care for because of the gore, although it's fascinating to me that, you know, what movie franchises have had 10 movies in them?
286997	287497	Not a lot.
287497	289838	There's some, but most of them are horror, but not a lot.
289838	295080	The 10th one is apparently getting the best reviews out of the whole series, which is wild to me.
295080	297221	I watched everything except the gory parts.
297221	298401	Yeah.
298401	300062	And it was it was pretty good.
300062	303423	I mean, plus, I mean, they brought back Amanda.
304249	305030	Yeah, I know.
305030	305350	I know.
305350	309576	But it's just it's that was like a big point for a lot of people, though.
309576	309816	I know.
309816	320289	But I just I'm just surprised that 10 movies in the series is finding its critical peak, or maybe it's just a part of our culture now that critics have just resigned themselves to accepting Saw.
320289	320670	I don't know.
321431	325376	Well, it went though through another thing too with the art direction in it.
325376	331544	They tried to recreate the same feel for the first movie and pretty much got it.
331544	332785	Yeah.
332785	333246	Yeah.
333246	336009	So they were even like matching color palettes.
337321	339502	I mean, I like the movie.
339502	341163	I hope there's a sequel to it.
341163	343624	I mean, I just like the characters.
343624	345686	The animatronics were fantastic.
345686	350748	Like I heard it made more money than like any other movie in October or this week in October.
350748	352429	So sequel sequels pretty much.
352429	355311	And that's with the movie being on Peacock as well.
355311	358092	So I would say a sequel is pretty much guaranteed.
358092	364896	Like it doesn't take a psychic to figure out that they're going to do a sequel to this based on this weekend alone.
365433	366193	I hope so.
366193	367554	It's definitely worth a watch.
367554	378497	But like if you're going in expecting a scary movie, it's not it really is not like they really ironically, like, you know, everybody always complains about horror movies having like jump scares.
378497	380617	And that's like a cheap scare type of thing.
380617	385219	Like, honestly, they probably should have leaned into that considering the property.
385219	393921	I'm surprised it didn't have a lot of jump scares when it's kind of it had it had some with if you play the game Balloon Boy,
395362	408352	Which, I thought that was funny because I guess, and this had to be explained to me by my son because once again, I don't play FNAF, so... But, Bloomboy's from the second game, and he jumpscares you, but he doesn't, like, hurt you.
408352	410934	It's just like, it's just a cheap jumpscare.
410934	417039	And that's what they used him, like, several times in the movie to do that, and I thought that was funny.
417039	418360	So that was cool.
420602	422184	I love Matthew Lillard.
422184	423164	I mean, he was great.
423164	425366	I think all the actors were really good in the movie.
425366	427788	I think it's pretty solid.
427788	436015	I know some people complained about the storyline and how there's some changes, but I'm like, yeah, but Scott Cawthorn's the one that's writing the story, so it's like...
437156	442982	It's kind of okay because that's, you know, he's doing this.
442982	447006	And also, I mean, you know, the games are separate from the cinematic universe.
447006	449709	So like sometimes people make changes based off that.
449709	453072	But I think overall it was really good.
453072	457576	Sad that Markiplier didn't get to be in there because apparently he was supposed to be in the movie as a
458587	465970	Well, it's in the very first scene, but like as the previous security guard and stuff, which would have been really cool.
465970	470472	But there are other like YouTubers and stuff in there that have cameos that are pretty funny.
470472	471512	It's cute.
471512	474714	We get to some comments from chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
474714	475874	By the way, your camera froze, Loki.
475874	478975	I don't know if it's a big deal, but let's see.
478975	483237	Dr. Tia says, not into horror movies, but we did finally finish Castlevania Nocturne.
483237	486739	You know, I used to say that about horror is that I'm not really into horror.
486739	487419	And then, you know,
487979	496563	Ironically, being involved with the Cult and Horror Movie Festival here locally, kind of opened my eyes that horror is a very nuanced genre, like comedy.
496563	497043	It really is.
497043	498784	There's different types of comedy, right?
498784	502965	There's Adam Sandler comedy movies, which I don't care for.
502965	506607	There's silly comedy, which I can kind of, like, it depends on what it is.
506607	507867	And there's, like, dark comedy.
507867	509548	I hate embarrassing stupid comedy.
509548	512309	Yeah, but then there's, like, dark humor and dark comedy.
512309	513630	Like, wow, that's really fucked up.
513630	514290	That's what I like.
514770	516612	is those types of movies.
516612	519634	Hey, Rob, I know a movie you would like if you haven't seen it.
519634	520755	What's that?
520755	521156	The Others.
522685	524085	Nicole Kidman.
524085	525265	Yeah, I saw that in the theater.
525265	526306	Actually, I love that movie.
526306	526966	That was good.
526966	527626	But that's a good.
527626	528446	I believe.
528446	534927	Okay, so going into this comment here, because Tigerclaw said, they can they can make horror movies for the families, though.
534927	536648	It doesn't have to be about blood and gore.
536648	537348	No, and that's true.
537348	541228	Actually, PG-13 horror movies tend to be my favorite.
541228	543069	I think the others was in that category.
543069	546229	I don't remember it being particularly violent or anything like that.
546229	549550	It's not to say I hate R-rated movies, because like, you know, there's campy ones I like, like,
549930	552914	Sleepaway Camp is a classic, and the Scream movies.
552914	554516	I appreciate the Scream movies for what they are.
554516	555276	They're fine.
555276	557779	They don't bother me, and they're actually pretty enjoyable.
557779	567651	But I actually see PG-13 horror as a challenge, because you can't rely on the shock value of kills necessarily to really scare people.
568792	572156	That's why I kind of dug The Ring, like when it first came out.
572156	576180	And keep in mind, you know, I knew it was kind of based on a Japanese story.
576180	579223	I was not diffed in that universe when I saw that movie.
579223	580825	I enjoyed it for what it was at the time.
580825	586571	And there's a lot of I think, like, or The Sixth Sense, you know, like, those were great PG-13 horror movies.
586571	589294	And those those are the types of things I really dig.
589294	590335	I think it's, it's, um,
590996	595418	a really great thing when you can scare people without having to resort to the gore stuff.
595418	597479	There's a time and a place for that, which is fine.
597479	602341	But yeah, like I like you are obsessed with Cube, that whole and I thought the first movie was really good.
602341	603522	I'm not really obsessed with it.
603522	608304	Well, you talk about a lot, but it's well, I was only talking about it because Brad brought it up.
608304	612906	But and it's disgusting gore wise, but it's it's really good.
612906	615027	So there's only little scenes.
615027	619629	I mean, now the third movie doesn't exist in my my mental universe.
620720	625922	But I like, even if it's a bad movie, I like, you know, like bad in general.
625922	634266	I like a good concept and I can get behind seeing how a concept is executed, even if it isn't necessarily the best acted thing.
634266	640829	Like one of my favorite movies, and for the life of me, I saw it when I was a kid and I only remembered scenes from it.
640829	646952	And then I managed to Google all the pieces together and found it was called The House Where Evil Dwells.
648599	663817	And it's actually work between Toei, the movie side of Toei, and an American company to bring Japanese horror to the U.S.
663817	664418	in the early 80s.
666289	675611	And that movie, going back and it kind of scared the crap out of me as a kid with the, you know, the evil possessed crab sounding like demons.
675611	682052	But as an adult, I can go back and appreciate it a lot more for what it tried to do.
682052	684073	And it actually isn't badly acted either.
684073	689114	I just think it was badly marketed and it was a concept that American audiences weren't necessarily ready for.
689114	690074	But it was really
691475	699058	I like a movie that has a psychological twist to it and I love a good ghost story.
699058	703900	Looking at some other comments and chat at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, D'Artesias says, Does Megan count?
703900	707101	I don't know if you'd consider it good, but it had some horror elements near the end there.
707101	707822	Oh, absolutely.
707822	708502	Megan counts.
708502	711563	But it goes back to that spectrum of horror movies.
711563	715765	Megan very much resides in that sub genre of horror we call camp.
716505	720008	It's a campy, and you know what else would it be in that category?
720008	723050	Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, which is like the queen of camp.
723050	732698	Okay, like these are movies that are, they're, they're scary, like a Disneyland, like Disneyland Haunted Mansion is scary, or Vincent Price in Thriller is scary.
732698	738142	You know, like, it's, it's a very campy genre that is bright.
738142	740124	It's probably my favorite subgenre for sure.
740584	742586	Add something about Megan, by the way.
742586	754358	One of my favorite YouTube channels called Cinematherapy analyzed the movie and showed how it actually was a really good portrayal of the process of grief.
754358	756019	I love Cinematherapy.
756019	761865	Like they also do like Anatomy of a Hero and all kinds of different things and why the Addams Family's relationship goals.
762352	771258	Yeah, Adam's Family is another great camp example, especially Adam's Family Values, which is one of those rare cases where I like, I really think time has shown the sequel superior to the original.
771258	772559	Joan Cusack is a goddess in that movie.
772559	778943	Yeah, Joan Cusack just like, just owns that movie, which is quite the task.
778943	781544	I got Malibu Barbie.
781544	783766	That's not who I am.
783766	786728	I was a ballerina.
786728	786988	Sorry.
789321	790021	All of that I can forgive.
790021	791082	They had to go.
791082	791862	All of this I can forgive.
791862	792483	They had to go.
792483	795784	But Debbie, Pastels.
795784	797405	That movie's so fucking good.
797405	799706	I know what I want to watch this Halloween now.
799706	801247	See, that's horror to me.
801247	802768	I fucking love camp.
802768	808130	And I consider the Disneyland Haunted Mansion is camp in a big way.
808130	810371	Nightmare Before Christmas, in a way, is camp.
810371	812512	That's my genre right there.
812512	814433	Did you ever see a movie called Saturday the 14th?
814433	814473	No.
817105	822909	It was a parody, of course, of Friday the 13th, and I saw it when I was a kid.
822909	829633	And I just, the funny thing about that movie was watching how much my mom's eyes rolled at it.
829633	831514	You know what else is super camp?
831514	833115	Later Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
834136	842445	is where Robert Englund really leaned into the camp nature of Freddy, like that, or like, you know, people getting killed with television sets falling on them and stuff like that.
842445	844207	That was the third one.
844207	847150	It had the best line in there that was actually ad-libbed.
847150	852155	After the second movie just went like bonkers, like the third movie and beyond was camp.
853719	859024	But there were just some really good ad-libbed lines like, welcome to primetime, bitch.
859024	861467	That was like the best ad-lib.
861467	867913	Next to flames on the side of my face.
867913	875160	I remember going to see Freddy's Dead in the theater and like, the fuck shit is this movie?
875160	876161	But I loved it.
877034	881016	especially the scene with Roseanne being crazy.
895382	897924	That song was not in the movie either.
897924	899265	It may have been in the credits.
899265	903068	They had the Five Nights at Freddy's song about Five Nights at Freddy's that was in the credits.
913018	916600	Actual like tune is not in the movie from what I remember.
916600	918640	The thing is, I think it's actually like Public Domain.
918640	921101	It's like the Toreador March.
921101	922182	It's an old song.
922182	924103	It's got to be Public Domain.
924103	926724	I can't remember what the show was now.
928700	929701	Let's see.
929701	932202	Okay, well, let's take a minute.
932202	934024	I know we've talked a little bit about the movie.
934024	944671	I didn't really have an actual kickoff topic scheduled for tonight because the news has been surprisingly not as active as it usually is.
945071	951898	But I did want to take a minute to catch up on we weren't here last week because DarkSakura and myself went to TwitchCon.
951898	960827	Now, earlier in the week, Bobby Blackwolf and I, the day you were coming home, DarkSakura, Bobby Blackwolf and I sat down and we recorded some of our own thoughts on, you know, how it all went.
960827	967814	We did one video on how it went and one video on the announcements they made at TwitchCon over at our YouTube channel at VOG Network.
968294	971977	I've had a few more days to process and I want to hear some more voices on this.
971977	975660	DarkSakura, you were also representing the network there at TwitchCon.
975660	978983	You've been to, this was your second, I believe, right?
978983	981064	Last year at San Diego would have been your first.
981064	983306	What were your thoughts on TwitchCon?
983306	986589	How did you enjoy the experience this year, particularly compared to last?
990126	992227	Last year was better.
992227	993888	The venue was better.
993888	999550	The costs were certainly better.
999550	1002672	It was overall a more pleasant experience.
1002672	1004633	The weather was better.
1004633	1007354	And I'm going to add in saying that I was
1008392	1019844	I was alright with Las Vegas because I got to see Tiara and I got to see all my friends again, although I missed a few people.
1019844	1024928	And we did Omega Mart, which Omega Mart's been on my bucket list.
1025689	1029111	Yeah, I did not- And I stayed for a solid hour and a half after you two left.
1029111	1031032	I was gonna say, we did not- Artie!
1031032	1048980	We, being me and Alan, did not give ourselves enough time to do Omega Mart, and that was a lesson learned on us, but it was also way more crowded than I expected, but I should have figured the day after TwitchCon and the music festival that was going on at the same time- There were a lot of people from when we were young.
1048980	1050961	It was gonna be super crowded, and that is what it is.
1050961	1052162	I'll just quickly say, I think
1052842	1055784	I think Bobby put it best for me in a way he said on his show.
1055784	1060668	He said, all of TwitchCon's problems did not have to do with TwitchCon.
1060668	1063931	They were very much the element of being in Las Vegas.
1063931	1068674	And I would cosign, I would say my biggest problem with this year's TwitchCon was Las Vegas.
1068674	1078922	And for the most part, Twitch itself, I think actually improved on a lot of stuff from last year on the elements they could control.
1078922	1079743	Anyway, sorry, DarkSakura.
1080629	1085513	Well, I actually, I disagree with that too.
1085513	1089896	I mean, first of all, the lines for the meet and greets are not very long.
1089896	1092177	I don't think most of the people there cared about meet and greets.
1092177	1095399	They're just other human beings that you can watch online.
1095399	1097161	End of story.
1097161	1105387	I really hated that the glitch theater was in the main area and that the artist alley didn't have a separate place either.
1107774	1118131	It was convenient to have that giant rather expensive food court in the center, but even so, that was more space you had to navigate around to get some of those other rooms that were upstairs.
1119139	1124303	Um, and the, uh, the map was kind of confusing as well.
1124303	1125664	They didn't really specify.
1125664	1139092	I, it took me forever to find that it was the West entrance and my Lyft driver the first day dropped me off at the North and I had to walk all the way around in, I think it was like 96 degrees, but of course it's drier in Las Vegas.
1139092	1143015	And on top of that, the badge pickup area had next to no shade in it.
1143015	1148159	There was like one little place that you could get some water and stand in front of a swamp cooler.
1150079	1169245	and a lot of us ended up like just trying to find little shady places and I did like having the food trucks there even though they were expensive so that was one thing I did like better especially the pierogi place because I ate pierogis and I felt my my Polish insides felt great but there were
1171460	1177066	I know that they did a lot to try to protect themselves without so many of the physical challenges there.
1177066	1182911	But honestly, some of those physical challenges were, you know, kind of fun distractions.
1182911	1184753	You know, they could have managed those better.
1184753	1193622	They could have, you know, put a little bit more into, you know, like having a cushioned floor or something if they wanted to do something a little bit more physical.
1195463	1200829	And I honestly thought that the sponsorship collaborations were weak this year.
1200829	1203932	The Doritos Mart thing was stupid.
1203932	1204933	Why Chevron?
1204933	1210238	And I think the only reason that the stuff for Gen V was there was because Amazon owns Twitch.
1214254	1221976	Now, I will say that there were some really good other booths there that I didn't see last year.
1221976	1231958	Like, there was a booth for Roland, and it was mostly focused on streaming, but they had some other really good audio interfaces there for, like, music creation.
1236174	1244782	There were a few other really, really good AV companies there.
1244782	1252609	And yeah, they were, again, mostly focusing on their streaming media, but I got to check out some other MIDI equipment.
1252609	1255351	And the Mix It Up guys were there.
1255351	1259134	They had signups for the alpha for the Mix It Up web tool.
1261375	1272899	I networked with the Humane Society and the American Heart Association because my dad's downfall started with a heart attack.
1272899	1275440	You know, stroke killed my grandmother.
1275440	1279561	You know, so it was really good and really good follow up.
1279561	1284222	And I networked with places that might even just turn into a job one day.
1284222	1288504	So it depends on the attitude that you go in there with.
1289544	1309515	And if you're looking for opportunities that are outside of like the, how are you going to benefit me as a streamer and how am I going to benefit you as a streamer, and actually take a step aside, because I may have some ins on doing some Mac testing for software down the line.
1309515	1316499	You know, it was really good to talk shop with some people, especially on the development side of their tools.
1318616	1325079	And I got to meet some people who, because you know, I'm just starting my data visualization education.
1325079	1329822	I got to talk to people who have really good experience in the world of data viz.
1329822	1331823	And I got to learn a lot from people.
1331823	1342749	You know, I went to a couple of the panels, but I think that apart from like the monetization, path to partner things, you know, those are the staples.
1342749	1345971	But I think that some of their panels need to think a little bit more outside the box too.
1346711	1347432	Thank you for watching!
1365854	1381349	Yeah, and that's the kind of feedback that I would leave, although I'm happy that the Twitch RPG had a bigger presence there, and we're really taking into account what people thought of the con itself and the sponsorship.
1383602	1384123	I won a Blurp plushie
1403894	1404695	I love Blurp.
1404695	1409622	They're actually who I use for a lot of my sound redeems in my channel.
1409622	1413607	I got to look at a few manufacturing things.
1413607	1418534	So I kind of went into the con with my business brain on.
1419608	1426075	You know, and it wasn't just, I want a sponsor, I want this, I want that.
1426075	1435724	It was, I want to form a longer term partnership with some of these parties here who are also forming longer term partnerships with their broadcasters.
1436685	1441888	And that was the point of view that I went into meeting all of these dealers with.
1441888	1445670	And then, of course, I vastly enjoyed the Artist Alley.
1445670	1447430	I got to network with some other artists.
1447430	1452413	I may have some commissions that I might be looking for down the line.
1452413	1454994	Lots of great talent.
1454994	1462778	And so there were a lot of positives, but it was a lesson that I learned from last year that to take that
1464449	1471933	Now that I've been through a TwitchCon once, my second go-through prepared me more for doing the kind of network I wanted to do.
1471933	1476136	I also learned probably not the best idea to use business cards anymore.
1476136	1480758	Everything is going to be scan that QR and save it.
1480758	1488723	There was another partner there that gave me a link to a different site where it's like an online business card in general.
1489843	1492624	Kind of Linktree-ish, but a little bit more interactive.
1492624	1494705	I'll have to find the name of it to go.
1494705	1509990	But yeah, that was... I think that I went into it with... God, I'm going to sound old saying this, but I went into it with, I think, a more mature outlook to make the convention work for me.
1511476	1515897	because in the end, that's what conventions like that are for.
1515897	1531802	They are for helping you build your channel, helping sponsors find people to help promote their material too, working with the community, and I was super happy that they were giving more attention to artist communities too, and people who weren't just playing games.
1534820	1536901	Yeah.
1536901	1541362	I enjoy TwitchCon for, you know, certainly it's, it's the chance for the community to get together.
1541362	1544863	And I think in a way, Alan is almost more into it than I am.
1544863	1548504	And at least with his like level of participation he does in the different communities and stuff.
1548504	1554466	So it was really nice being able to meet and mingle with some of the people that, you know, he spends a lot of time with online.
1554466	1556547	And I, I lurk in channels and do that stuff too.
1556547	1560108	Although I find by not chatting more, people don't seem to know me as well, which is fine.
1560108	1560668	It is what it is.
1561048	1561548	Twitch Twitch
1588997	1616354	uh show at a local bar and so we ended up going to that as well and we didn't we missed the first part but we saw the second that's where we dropped you off right yes exactly right that's where you dropped us off because we missed the first part because of dinner which is fine because i wanted to see tiara i've been forever since i've seen him so um this this we saw the second half though and got to see the performers there and honestly like i i don't want to say it was better than the drag show but it was awesome because
1617054	1641862	you got to actually see like club acts like in the club if you know what I mean and uh yeah like Bitchpuddin performed and did this number that was so infectious and so funny London Bradshaw just like brought the house down with some moves I think there was a lot of kills it yeah there was just a lot of but it was really nice to see the drag performances like in a club where I think many of these folks are kind of used to performing so um that was a lot of fun I think some of the
1642302	1647284	Some of the stage performances really would have been suited better for that sort of environment.
1647284	1648445	Strong agree.
1648445	1658028	But the reason why I bring that up, that particular event, that was born of the community and for all intents and purposes has nothing to do with Twitch in regards to the convention.
1658028	1664691	Now, obviously, this is a community of people who met on Twitch and grew on Twitch, but Twitch themselves did not put on this event.
1664691	1669393	So I think it goes to show that when you have the ability to have these kind of satellite events,
1670033	1670153	and
1691348	1698034	Vegas might be a great thing for work-based conventions and professional and industry conventions and that sort of thing.
1698034	1699996	I think it failed us for Twitch.
1699996	1708163	And I'm really happy to hear the news came out this week that representative for Twitch has already gone on record saying TwitchCon 2024 is not in Las Vegas.
1710504	1711385	DarkSakura
1738987	1741148	BlizzCon is coming up this weekend.
1741148	1748913	BlizzCon is another great example of a convention where people want to be able to have their meetups outside the convention too, like guilds and stuff for World of Warcraft.
1748913	1750313	That's huge at BlizzCon.
1750313	1751914	I think Anaheim's a great candidate too.
1751914	1754496	Selfishly, I'd love to see Seattle.
1754496	1757398	I haven't done Seattle for a convention since PAX.
1757398	1758899	I had a great time at PAX.
1758899	1761900	I think Seattle's set up very well for that sort of thing as well.
1761900	1764182	Like if Twitch were to go to a new city,
1764522	1764863	TwitchCon Reno
1780558	1784362	Snow can start happening this early in the year, which I know no big deal.
1784362	1787564	But like, if it's I know that wasn't a serious comment anyway.
1787564	1796572	But if it starts to snow on the overpass, like all the people that would be planning to come in from the Bay Area would have to add like six hours to their trip, put chains on their car and all this crap.
1796572	1799375	Like it's just the twitch going audience would not be prepared.
1799375	1803358	So yeah, Reno Reno is a terrible choice for that reason.
1805327	1808388	If it was a summer convention, maybe, but yeah.
1808388	1811970	Reno's trying to change their image a lot.
1811970	1817592	They're not trying to be Vegas Light anymore, but that's a topic for another show.
1817592	1827176	I think also one big thing I would like to see Twitch lean into a little more, you brought up the sponsorships that do make sense and don't make sense, and I agree.
1827176	1832919	It was cool to see things like Roland, Elgato, the charity things, that all made sense.
1833539	1838262	I was really surprised at how few games were on display.
1849269	1855676	has really been a kingmaker in some ways for some big indie games, right?
1855676	1857859	Five Nights at Freddy's is a great example.
1857859	1866268	Now, granted, YouTube as well, but let's say the streaming, the video, the content creation space made a game like Five Nights at Freddy's, and now look at what it is.
1867149	1867830	Minecraft
1884449	1891178	Smaller mid companies and indie companies that are really trying to connect with streamers because they have the next big thing.
1891178	1893201	Like an artist alley for game makers.
1893201	1894883	I would love that.
1894883	1898408	And I think there's a lot of indie folks that would love that too, to be quite honest.
1898408	1901792	So that would be my wish for a future TwitchCon, but we'll see what happens.
1903664	1910928	Dark to see you in chat says I've seen a lot of retro game devs reach out to a couple streamers I follow in the retro community for sponsored streams.
1910928	1912990	So 100% agree with what Rob's saying.
1912990	1924297	Absolutely get those game makers in front of because here's the thing, Twitch does a great well, the partners might argue they could do a better job massaging the partner relationships, but they have
1924597	1926498	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1951471	1964474	But, um, yeah, I, uh, I, I'm just, I feel like the affiliates that are in the middle that have small but loyal communities, like look at all of you that show up here Sunday night for Orange Launch Radio.
1964474	1965254	We appreciate you.
1965254	1966794	Thank you so much for being here.
1966794	1967814	But like it's communities.
1967814	1969315	We got keyboard cats.
1969315	1969895	Yeah.
1969895	1976276	But like at TwitchCon, there really isn't anybody trying to reach out to y'all.
1977349	1981836	They want to get to the big folks, the partners, or community.
1981836	1983999	But affiliates, I feel like, don't have as much.
1983999	1986222	So I think that would be a great connection.
1986222	1992732	An indie game arcade would be a great place because those indie makers are not going to say no to affiliates.
1994325	1998488	And to be fair, most of the companies that were there were still really good about talking to affiliates.
1998488	1998928	They knew.
1998928	2000789	So I just want to be very clear.
2000789	2006132	But I think there's some companies that pass on TwitchCon, probably, that it's a bummer.
2006132	2011316	By the way, another great reason why I think it should go to Seattle.
2011316	2013777	Just saying.
2013777	2015198	At least try a year.
2015198	2016739	If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
2016739	2020241	But it couldn't possibly be worse than Vegas.
2020241	2021422	Famous last words.
2022839	2024679	Uh, we'll see.
2024679	2027320	Let me ask this question before we get into other news for the week.
2027320	2031781	Uh, did you have any opinions or thoughts on some of the news that came out of TwitchCon DarkSakura?
2031781	2045683	The big one everybody's talking about is the, um, uh, exclusive, yeah, exclusive agreement with, uh, that you can now, if we wanted to, hypothetically, we haven't really talked about it.
2045683	2050484	If we wanted to, we could simulcast this show on YouTube now, at the same time we're doing it on Twitch.
2050484	2052004	There is no more rule about that.
2052580	2053702	It's a matter of time.
2053702	2057489	They've already figured it out with TikTok, so it just seemed inevitable.
2057489	2058030	I'm not surprised.
2058030	2062479	I thought they had some sort of restrictions with, like, pulling chats together, though, or something like that.
2063035	2071760	They have some speak that isn't very specific, I will say, but it is basically that you can't degrade the Twitch experience.
2071760	2082767	And one thing that they call out is the combining of chat rooms, basically, because they don't want you basically, they don't want you to be talking to people that aren't there on Twitch, I think is what they're worried about.
2082767	2086610	But what's interesting, we've already seen some partners kind of stare that in the face and
2087390	2087670	Alright, um...
2110925	2111806	Let's move on.
2111806	2117114	I will, of course, plug the YouTube as well for all the other stories.
2117114	2122402	From Bobby's perspective, he talks a lot about Games Done Quick Express, which was there at TwitchCon as well.
2122402	2125466	So it's kind of neat to say I've been doing Games Done Quick.
2126067	2132472	of sorts, because it really was a very, from what Bobby was telling me, it's a very similar experience.
2132472	2138236	What you saw in that room at TwitchCon is what you would see in the ballroom at a regular GDQ as well.
2138236	2146522	I mean, maybe more people behind the scenes and stuff like that, but for the most part, you got a pretty good sense of what it's like to be at a GDQ by going to that Express at TwitchCon.
2146522	2147262	It was fun.
2147262	2149084	Yeah, it was a good show.
2149084	2152926	Bobby did some great work with them, but I'll let him speak to that on his platforms.
2152926	2154207	But it was a lot of fun to get to see that.
2155421	2156682	Alright, let's move on.
2156682	2158524	We're going to get into the rest of the news for the week.
2158524	2161766	But first, I want to talk about our gaming weeks.
2161766	2163968	So how was your gaming week?
2163968	2166170	Let's go over to DarkSakura.
2166170	2168632	How was your gaming week?
2168632	2170433	Oh, geez, I played a bunch of pinball.
2174274	2183641	I played Dead by Daylight, I played... I didn't start my retro game because I changed the one I was going to play.
2183641	2196749	I was going to play Rayearth, and then instead did Treasure of the Rudra, which I will be starting either next Saturday if I don't go to a party, or the Saturday afterwards.
2196749	2201753	But it was the last RPG that Square released for the Super Famicom.
2202473	2206934	that never came out in the US.
2206934	2209515	I played other stuff.
2209515	2211715	What did I play?
2211715	2217656	I was watching a bunch of people play Devour earlier.
2217656	2223557	We have a couple of mutual friends who are raising money for Streamers for a Cause.
2228075	2232036	I played other stuff, but I'll tell you what, my brain is broken.
2232036	2237677	So... I couldn't remember what I did five minutes ago.
2237677	2239858	Oh yeah, I was talking about TwitchCon five minutes ago.
2239858	2241258	Yes.
2241258	2243839	Um... Yeah.
2243839	2247820	Oh no, I did play some... I played some Gradius, actually.
2247820	2248920	Oh, that's cool.
2248920	2251741	I know I played other retro things.
2251741	2255942	But yeah, my brain is... I don't remember.
2255942	2256862	I don't remember.
2257728	2259771	Alright, well then let's check in with LokiOLR.
2259771	2261955	How was your gaming week?
2261955	2266342	It's all Minecraft, of course, but there was a few different things.
2266342	2269948	So, one, I finished my second episode of
2270851	2271171	Second?
2271171	2274614	Yeah, second episode of Channel 64 Season 3.
2274614	2285923	So that was, it was difficult to get it to what I wanted it to be, but I got the special effects working and it looks amazing now.
2285923	2290887	Basically, I had my starter base walk around the server, like,
2292659	2301731	I've been splitting my time between that and working on the next episode for Channel 64.
2307719	2313904	So RazeWorks is a big technical YouTuber, Minecraft streamer as well.
2313904	2320090	Got like a half a million followers on or subscribers on YouTube and stuff.
2320090	2333381	And so he's doing a thing for his sub server right now that's running my Deep Dark World data pack, plus a modified Deep Dark World data pack that I modified for him.
2333381	2333902	He wanted it
2334572	2338933	to have more Skulk stuff around.
2338933	2344195	So I've actually been playing that with them this week for some of the time.
2344195	2345095	So I've started that.
2345095	2349117	I was actually just about to start editing an episode out for that.
2349117	2353218	So that'll be fun.
2353218	2357039	It's a slow grind, that one, because the amount of
2357914	2367006	Wardens that are out there that you can't, well, I can kill them now because I've killed 10 of them, but they will kill you very fast if you're not careful.
2367006	2372433	And so it's been fun to watch everybody try to like go through that challenge again that I've done.
2374161	2375202	So yeah, it's been fun.
2375202	2376783	I've been doing that.
2376783	2390291	Definitely be getting back into episode three of Child64 this week and working on the storage room because that is integral to all the projects, staying organized and having all your resources and everything all in one place.
2390291	2392873	So I'm very much looking forward to that.
2392873	2395535	And I have it designed already and it looks great.
2395535	2395875	Can't wait.
2397537	2399740	But go check out my second episode if you haven't done it yet.
2399740	2406328	It's really cool, especially the part where my base walks around and talks.
2406328	2413136	So, I basically built the Iron Giant, but out of wood, and he's made out of shipwrecks.
2413831	2416693	I'll have to check that out because that came out probably while I was gone.
2416693	2418855	So yeah, kudos on that.
2418855	2420677	Sounds good.
2420677	2421958	Let's see, my gaming week.
2421958	2428664	Honestly, because I was gone for quite a bit, not just TwitchCon, but Alan and I did a Disney trip before that, which was fun.
2428664	2430886	So got to do the usual rides and all that.
2430886	2438513	But I would say, as far as gaming goes, honestly, the vast majority of my time since I got back, Diablo 4 Season 2.
2439173	2467775	because that started the day I left and so I had to get a week late head start on it which is which not a head start but you know week late start on it but um which is fine because there's no leaderboards there's no reason to rush it you just you know you want to get everything done by the time the season is over in mid-january or whenever it's supposed to end but um I'm having a good time I'm already up to level 47 so just a few more levels I'm playing a barrage rogue um so that's a lot of fun to just keep shooting arrows and knives arrows and knives arrows and knives arrows and knives
2468815	2472316	And yeah, having fun with that.
2472316	2477597	I did a quick stream of that earlier in the week, and I probably will stream it again, but there's a lot of other stuff I need to catch up on.
2477597	2479918	Super Mario Wonder also came out while I was gone.
2479918	2481518	That came out while I was at TwitchCon.
2481518	2482759	Been hearing a lot of great things about that.
2482759	2484519	Did you hear any of the voices?
2484519	2486900	Just what was in the preview.
2486900	2489380	I heard Luigi's voice during gameplay.
2489380	2493861	Yeah, I mean, the new voice actor is very authentic to Charles Martinet.
2493861	2495102	Is he?
2495102	2495322	Yeah.
2496474	2497415	Thanks for watching!
2516514	2521036	So it's it's been a it's been a wild year for games.
2521036	2525419	Another whopper of a release came out this week that nobody's brought up yet.
2525419	2527360	It's being extremely well received.
2527360	2532762	That's Alan Wake 2, which really puts it in my mind like, dang it, I need to go back.
2532762	2536805	I like got all the way to the last chapter of Alan Wake 1 and never finished it.
2536805	2539766	So I need to like go back and play it to remind myself of the story.
2539766	2540887	And then Control
2542007	2545510	Everybody who's played that game raves about it, and I still never played that.
2545510	2552394	So at some point, I just need to like take a week or two and catch up on Remedy Games and play.
2552394	2556517	Alan Wake 2 apparently is really good and seems like the kind of game I'd be into.
2556517	2563662	As a lot of streamers I see playing it, it's great for the Halloween season as a game to play.
2563662	2566624	And yeah, I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on that for sure.
2566624	2571407	So and it's just it's just another game to add to this year of
2572128	2586685	This may be the most interesting Game Awards season we've ever had, because I don't even know what 5 games make the shortlist at this point.
2590069	2590249	Diablo 4
2609348	2612590	So many great games this year.
2612590	2617952	It is going to be impossible to narrow it down to one.
2617952	2627617	I kind of feel like Baldur's Gate 3 has a bit of an edge, just, I don't know, it's what my gut tells me, but I could see it going a lot of different directions.
2628317	2635343	got we still we still have Zelda and now at this at this point I'm like does does the newest Zelda game even get nominated?
2635343	2636584	I think it does.
2636584	2638726	But I could see a situation where it doesn't.
2638726	2641268	And that would be wild to me.
2641268	2644891	So it's but that's that's the year in games we're having.
2644891	2647833	It's wacky wacky wild.
2647833	2651636	Quest Buster in chat points out a new Yakuza game next month too.
2651636	2652257	Oh my god.
2654573	2655433	It's a year.
2655433	2656994	It's a year for releases.
2656994	2660434	But what a great time to be a gamer, that's for sure.
2660434	2665015	So let's get into some gaming news and talk about what else is going on in the industry.
2665015	2676317	And Loki, quite the bombshell following up our big story from last time we were live two weeks ago was the official marriage of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft happened.
2676317	2680218	And now we're starting to see the first changes, right, Loki?
2681010	2698301	Yes, and ironically, not necessarily with Activision, as you might think, but ZeniMax is going to continue, I guess, apparently to operate in limited integration entity led by Jamie Leder, president and CEO.
2698301	2705506	And apparently that they're basically shifting around some of the executives in the company.
2705506	2709369	So thankfully, Bobby Kotick will be out at the end of this year.
2710305	2712287	That was nice to have that reinforced.
2712287	2718235	That was so lovely to now we can put up our countdown clocks that there's only so many days left.
2718235	2722500	Let's see days until Jan 1.
2722500	2723901	64 days.
2723901	2727966	64 days until we get to get to cut the most toxic thing out of this industry.
2727966	2728327	64 days.
2729850	2733652	So basically, what's going to happen is the reorganization of the Xbox division.
2733652	2741317	They're going to have Matt Booty, who is going to be overseeing ZeniMax and Bethesda Game Studios.
2741317	2745199	He's going to be more directly the head of the game services.
2745199	2748901	And along with that, also, I guess,
2750302	2757765	Sarah Bond, the former VP is now going to be the president of Xbox in charge of everything related to the platform.
2757765	2764227	So basically, like the consoles and that type of thing, and the services and all that.
2764227	2771390	Am I correct that now this would be the first time now granted, Phil Spencer is still the head of Microsoft gaming, the large, you know, but
2771730	2783597	If Sarah Bond is over Xbox, the platform, and I am I correct or am I missing something that that would make her the first woman to be the CEO of a major console?
2783597	2784358	Maybe, I don't know.
2784358	2787099	I believe it does.
2787099	2788280	So that's pretty incredible.
2788280	2790381	Yeah, no idea.
2790381	2792323	Let's see.
2792323	2796045	Yeah, so Jamie Leder, president CEO is going to be
2796656	2797276	ZeniMax, MattBooty
2813399	2819405	Things like Redfall, you know, keeping a closer eye on how the studios are going.
2819405	2825452	Because according, you know, previously they said, you know, I feel accountable that we could have done better with Arcane.
2825452	2829856	And so we'll see if that actually ends up being the case, you know.
2829856	2831899	Actions speak louder than words, of course.
2831899	2832800	So, you know.
2834176	2836117	Let's see what happens there.
2836117	2847703	Along with that, real quick, I just because QuestBuster is giving some great supplemental info that just kind of, you know, if you want to read the tea leaves and look at these folks resume and why there are some reasons to be excited.
2847703	2851786	QuestBuster points out Matt Booty was at a gaming company for most of his career.
2851786	2854847	He was the CEO of Midway before he went over to Microsoft.
2854847	2856468	Yes, Midway was a lot of good stuff.
2856468	2858949	Sarah Bond has a great career as well.
2858949	2861831	She was part of the team that turned T-Mobile around.
2862131	2862651	a pretty strong yeah
2885226	2896054	Phil Spencer said that we believe in expanding gaming content organization, one that enables Xbox Game Studios and ZeniMax Development Studios to collaborate effectively together.
2896054	2901859	We'll empower those world-class studios to do their best work in growing our portfolio of games that players love.
2906530	2913415	Sometimes these reorg things are very nerve-wracking announcements, but I like where this is going.
2921861	2923062	I think we knew that wasn't going to happen.
2923062	2929125	But if there's a if there's a phrase that we learned in 2023, it's bet on Bobby.
2929125	2931187	Well, Bobby Blackwolf.
2931187	2934529	But that's that's where I draw that line.
2934529	2935689	I would say with
2937190	2939312	The Gaming Public at Large did not care for that game.
2960049	2974888	Starfield is not a bomb, but I think for as long as that game was in development, again, unfortunately, because that game got delayed to 2023 and Starfield is releasing this year,
2975856	2976796	It's going to get lost.
2976796	2978977	Starfield will not be nominated for game of the year.
2978977	2982038	It's, there's too much other better stuff that came out.
2982038	2994801	But, but my point is what I'm trying to say is that because of these, you know, if you want to call it missteps or whatever from Bethesda on a couple of fronts, I'm glad we're not hearing that all these frontline workers are getting laid off.
2994801	3001683	And instead it's we're rearranging the executives to put a little more oversight over here.
3001683	3003484	And it's, it's, they're trying to shit now.
3004364	3012013	Granted, if this gets followed up with a story next week that, well, we only brought in the executive to, you know, start the chopping block, then I'll be pissed.
3012013	3025588	But if this is where that kind of goes, and it's like, okay, let's try this as opposed to laying a bunch of people off, then I'm happy to hear this, that this is their solution to try to fix a couple of missteps at Bethesda.
3027250	3051174	Yeah, I would say, um, you know, to your point about, like, um, well, Redfall and Starfield, yeah, I think for sure, like, especially with Redfall, at the very least, I would say more so the disappointment was greater in Redfall than it was Starfield, because Redfall, like, Arkane Studios, their games have been, like, fantastic, extremely polished, like, you know, the Dishonored series, just fantastic, um,
3053167	3081424	Starfield I'm still surprised the amount of jankiness in there like I thought the whole point like with these new games is like let's get away from this engine that we've been using for all of these like Elder Scrolls games and like rebuild the whole thing because it's still got some bugs in there and so it's like now we're gonna use it again we're gonna really push it to its limit and like yeah we'll rebuild part of it but like there's still like issues that have been here for
3082335	3083756	How many games now?
3083756	3084616	So many.
3084616	3088118	Like, just build a whole new engine, please.
3088118	3089419	Like, it's not working.
3089419	3090920	You need to start over.
3090920	3095642	Or, like, start over or use, like, Unreal or something, you know?
3095642	3100605	Because its jankiness has been around for a long time.
3100605	3107089	And, yeah, certainly Todd Howard, like Todd Howard likes to do, is overselling the scope of the game.
3108897	3111878	Yeah, yeah, it kind of is oversold.
3111878	3114319	So there's some comments in chat I really want to piggyback on.
3114319	3117720	Mike Deft says, Starfield was standard for Bethesda standards.
3117720	3118781	It was fine.
3118781	3122962	But the answer says, yeah, that's my impression to Starfield is a very Bethesda game.
3122962	3125303	And if you like that formula, there you go.
3125303	3127324	My the way I'm piggybacking on those comments and saying
3127924	3139173	A fine game is getting lost in 2023, because we've had spectacular after spectacular game, 10 out of 10 games coming out every other month this entire year.
3139173	3144197	And it just this was this was not the year for Starfield to be a par release.
3144197	3146059	I think any other year it would do fine.
3146059	3154405	But, you know, there's also folks out there and plenty that feel like Matt do, SJ100 Matt saying, I'm still really enjoying Starfield over 100 plus hours into it.
3154405	3156167	But the whole thing really is Skyrim in space.
3157387	3163169	For sure, just because it could have been better doesn't mean it's not already good.
3163169	3164309	I think it's good.
3164309	3166490	Is it Game of the Year worthy?
3166490	3168850	Maybe some people think that, and that's fine.
3168850	3177913	Honestly, Skyrim has its issues, tons of issues, but that's a game I could easily go back and play another hundred hours in and stuff like that.
3177913	3181534	And so if this is Skyrim in space, I mean...
3183524	3188567	Fallout, you know, like Fallout 4, Skyrim and probably even Oblivion and all that stuff.
3188567	3194251	Like those are games I can go back to and just sink hundreds of hours into again and again and again.
3194251	3199374	It never feels old to me, which is nice so that they have their own charm to them.
3199374	3202716	But yeah, they're not like the most polished of things.
3202716	3209440	I kind of like that as long as it's not breaking the game in the sense that I can't progress in quests and stuff.
3209440	3211781	I'm fine with NPCs glitching out and stuff like that, but
3213905	3223049	I don't know, it's a charm, but it's also like, it's a charm because this is what I have to settle for because they won't make a better game, so, you know.
3223049	3224310	Learn to appreciate it, I guess.
3225816	3227396	Alright, well let's move on.
3227396	3235179	We got some other news stories we want to get to tonight, including talking about some information with the new PlayStation 5 that is highly controversial.
3235179	3239660	When I say the new PlayStation 5, I mean that Slim model we were talking about a couple weeks ago.
3239660	3244902	Well, some news has come out about that optional disc drive for the Slim model.
3244902	3245802	You remember this?
3245802	3252884	How you can get the Slim model and there's an optional disc drive that you can put on that, although you can buy a version that has the two together.
3252884	3253184	But
3253764	3271152	Apparently some small print on the back of the box for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 PS5, the bundle, so they're selling like a slim bundle for this, it says that players who purchase the new model with the optional drive must, required, to connect to the internet when pairing it to a machine for the first time.
3271752	3280515	This is being called a security measure to ensure that the drive is legitimate and not a third party, but this is leading to some preservation concerns.
3280515	3283537	If the accessory requires an internet connection to be verified,
3284747	3286949	What happens when those servers don't exist anymore?
3304404	3305484	So that's kind of weird.
3305484	3307345	Yeah.
3307345	3313806	Now, it could be, and it should go without saying, Sony could release an update that removes the requirement.
3313806	3315467	So, you know, that is always possible.
3315467	3319848	Just like, someday, Steam may release a patch that removes all the DRM.
3319848	3322928	If Steam were to ever go out of business, that is something that they've committed to.
3322928	3324869	They will release a patch that removes the DRM.
3325589	3330111	That will probably not be seen in my lifetime at this point, quite honestly.
3330111	3333793	But they could always patch it out that way.
3333793	3340635	But yeah, apparently this all comes from a way that Sony and Microsoft paired the disk drives with motherboards.
3340635	3347258	An analysis that was done by Wired in 2020 shows that disk drives have daughterboards that pair with the motherboards.
3347258	3349979	I've actually never heard that term, a daughterboard, before, but OK.
3351360	3354824	It creates a handshake that is unique to that pairing.
3354824	3366677	In this research that Wire did, they removed disk drives from PS console launches and swapped them, but the consoles would refuse to recognize the other drive, even though it is identical hardware.
3366677	3367898	Why is this happening?
3368559	3379966	Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which says it is illegal to, quote, circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to copyrighted work.
3379966	3383529	That would be firmware on the disk drive.
3383529	3384589	Interesting.
3384589	3391474	So to prevent piracy, the pairing method is happening to make sure that the console will only work with the drive paired to it.
3391474	3396537	So that way someday you can't come in with, oh, here's a third party drive that plays any game, ta-da.
3397381	3397761	and do it.
3397761	3402923	Uh, I, I, I, it'll be cracked.
3402923	3403903	Daughter board.
3403903	3405223	Daughter board, Loki.
3405223	3406144	Motherboard.
3406144	3412806	Daughter board doesn't mean jack if you like spoof the keys on it so that it thinks it's a legit drive.
3412806	3415407	That's how you used to do it in the Xbox 360 days.
3415407	3420208	Granted, it wasn't necessarily a daughter board that they verified.
3420208	3423449	I mean, you can put all sorts of things in there, but, um,
3424771	3429156	I just feel like if they're taking this measure then that means there's an exploit here.
3429156	3429476	I don't know.
3430839	3431620	Interesting.
3431620	3435622	Yeah, I also can agree that hackers gonna hack and that whole thing.
3435622	3440185	So I'm sure people are still trying to work to break this, but we'll, we'll see.
3440185	3444468	Yeah, Dr. C says, I believe that the hackers are all challenge accepted, right?
3444468	3449391	I mean, technically, Nintendo had their own security measures back in the NES days.
3449391	3456336	And that's, that's what the whole Atari making their own cartridges under the Tengen name and all that with that whole mess came up.
3456336	3460119	And now here we are, what 30 plus years later, and
3461119	3473013	Third-party Nintendo hardware is commonplace now because those, you know, patents and stuff run out, so you have all these other companies like Hyperkin and stuff that just make their own- they're basically making their own Nintendos.
3473013	3474435	What is a Retron?
3474435	3478059	It's a third-party Nintendo Entertainment System, plus other stuff, so.
3478991	3479351	DarkSakura
3505949	3512156	DarkSakura, I don't know if you are muted on Discord.
3512156	3514158	Oh, I think she actually went AFK.
3514158	3516360	So let's go ahead and go to the next story.
3516360	3518503	So Loki, why don't we go to you?
3518503	3521886	All right, let's talk about Unity again.
3521886	3525110	So this is kind of a big duh, like, um,
3526685	3547702	rumor news or whatever but basically that and I know this is gonna come up to a surprise suit but apparently that runtime fee announcement was rushed out like the whole idea of that controversial runtime fee it wasn't well thought out and apparently that is at least what the rumor is regarding this according to some inside sources
3548662	3566117	said that Unity itself, or apparently there was resistance to the runtime fee idea, but those concerns were ignored and certain people in the company made the decision to go ahead and basically push it forward anyways.
3566117	3574184	Also saying that the policy was rushed out and driven by Unity and Ironsource's intense battle with Applovin over the mediation business.
3576781	3588025	They even said, allegedly, that the, um, apparently, uh, John Riccatello, um, said, uh, fuck you, we're not paying.
3588025	3601689	Uh, when it came, when it came, uh, to, I guess, uh, what they said, it's even been claimed one mobile game publisher told, oh, told them basically that, yeah, fuck you, we're not paying your, your fees.
3601689	3601749	Um,
3603226	3604547	I mean, I believe it.
3604547	3605648	Yeah, that's for sure.
3605648	3615774	Like, it seemed rushed out and stupid, and we knew that a lot of it did have some sort of... something to do with the whole Iron Source and Apploven thing, considering that they're like, hey, you know what?
3615774	3620637	If you use our service, you won't have to pay those fees, you know, if you don't use their service.
3620637	3625179	So that's very anti-competitive anyways.
3625179	3626720	So yeah, it makes sense.
3626720	3628882	But hey, it's backtracked now.
3628882	3631423	I'm sure they won't do anything stupid in the future.
3633402	3636244	I'm sure it's just gonna be all smooth sailing from here on out.
3657000	3675779	it's just it's dumb like the whole thing was dumb and it's still dumb but whatever you know uh i think that there's it's certainly hurt them permanently i think um it is you know the trust that they
3677340	3683462	that they have, you know, with their developer partners, it's certainly been broken for a lot of them.
3683462	3691325	So I think for some, it's just like, it's a necessity to work with this engine right now, because that's where we have, our team has the experience.
3691325	3695847	But certainly, I think that, you know, it has probably hurt them.
3696513	3697634	Yeah, absolutely.
3697634	3712994	Because there's some developers out there that even in that, you know, week or however long that gap was between that initial announcement, and then, you know, them backtracking on it, you know, for the most part, I know they kind of came out with something different, but you know, addressing the concerns after the fact, basically.
3713294	3713534	DarkSakura.
3735001	3744212	making the not-so-rush decision in some way about, oh, we need to reevaluate what our long-term plan looks like here because of the action that Unity took.
3744212	3754925	So this whole misstep is fascinating in a business sense, and I think this gets studied in business school in the future.
3755926	3759589	SG100 Matt in our chatroom says, fuck you, I'm crashing this ship.
3759589	3760891	The John Riccatello story.
3760891	3763954	Yeah, in some ways, that could be a great name for the biography.
3765777	3772222	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they won't do anything stupid in the near future, but next year all bets are off.
3772222	3786073	Well, Unity could also pray that Unreal makes a dumb ass decision next year or somebody else, you know, somebody else shits the bed next year and takes the heat off of them because
3787110	3793373	The industry may forgive Unity once, but they certainly won't forgive them again if they make the same problem.
3793373	3797675	I mean, they've done a lot of dumb things that not on this level, not on this level.
3797675	3799716	Yeah, not on this level for sure.
3799716	3802397	But like, it's certainly been going that direction.
3802397	3803658	Yeah.
3803658	3807660	You know, they've been they've been like kind of.
3807660	3812142	Testing the waters with shitting in the bed slightly, and then now they just fully shit the bed.
3812142	3814463	Just a light shitting.
3814463	3815644	It'll be warm for a minute.
3816769	3820841	They're just hotboxing the bed, and then they're just like, oh wait.
3820841	3821544	Nasty people.
3824468	3825749	All right.
3825749	3827190	Um, let's see.
3827190	3828671	Um, let me see.
3828671	3830552	I was gonna see if there's any other comments in chat.
3830552	3832413	Oh, DJRamaS was talking about something else.
3832413	3837016	The Comerica Codemasters NES cart with a switch to get around that lockout chip.
3837016	3838957	Yeah, you know, people have ways of getting around it.
3838957	3843620	And now people are going to have their ways of getting around Unity as well, for sure.
3843620	3845341	Anyway, let's move on.
3845341	3847402	DarkSakura, we'll go to you for the next story.
3849281	3858828	Well, um, I feel extra old now because, uh, Super Mario Brothers 3 is 35 years old.
3858828	3864491	Um, yeah, it came out in Japan on October 23rd, 1990, sorry, 1988 and North America, February 12th, 1990.
3864491	3865152	And in Europe, August 29th, 1991.
3865152	3865192	Um.
3874744	3876025	It was a really good game.
3876025	3879588	I mean, I think we all got our prep for it from The Wizard, remember?
3879588	3880429	Oh, yeah.
3880429	3880789	Oh, yeah.
3880789	3882230	I remember The Wizard.
3882230	3882691	Sure.
3882691	3883491	Yeah.
3883491	3887074	But but yeah, old.
3887074	3887875	Yay.
3887875	3903388	It's funny because I have, ironically, I have a Halloween memory because I want to say the year that that came out in the States, Halloween was on a Friday or Saturday, because I remember hanging out with one of my buddies when I was like nine years old.
3904088	3908931	And we went around trick or treating and I remember going through the and I remember we ate so much candy.
3908931	3910592	We stayed up all night with a sugar rush.
3910592	3914174	We played Super Mario Brothers 3 all fucking night.
3914174	3914574	All night.
3914574	3915335	That's great.
3915335	3921758	Yeah, but that's you know, that's what you did when you're that young, you know, you let's let's stay up till four in the morning because we can and then we'll just sleep till noon.
3921758	3921999	So
3924600	3926401	Anyway, that's great.
3926401	3931125	SSJ100 Matt in chat says Super Mario Brothers 3 was the first game I camped out for.
3931125	3936769	My mom woke up early and we sat in the parking lot at Sears waiting for it to open.
3936769	3937709	Aww.
3937709	3943714	Did you hear about the new Sears that opened in Burbank apparently and how sad it is?
3943714	3944194	No.
3944194	3952220	Yeah, apparently it had closed a couple years ago during the pandemic, but it's the first like new Sears, the first like opening of a Sears in a long time.
3952220	3953941	And it's apparently it's not good.
3955487	3957009	I'm surprised that they're still around.
3957009	3958611	I thought the whole company went out.
3958611	3963376	There's like 22 stores left in the country.
3963376	3965538	There's like, what, 1 Kmart?
3965538	3970043	So there's not a lot left.
3970043	3970924	Wild to think about.
3972885	3980834	Also wild to think about is what Nintendo might be doing for the Switch 2, or the Switch's successor, or whatever you want to call it.
3980834	3993407	And boy oh boy have the rumors picked up steam this week because a patent was filed by Nintendo for a dual screen console that can be split in half and become two separate handheld devices.
3994108	4000316	So this is yeah, and now it's important to say, this is just a patent.
4000316	4004240	That doesn't mean that it's we see patents filed by companies all the time to go nowhere.
4004240	4008706	But it certainly has people going, Oh, does this mean Nintendo is going to go back to the 3DS?
4010455	4019428	Apparently in the patent it shows a device that resembles a 3DS, but it can actually be split in half for wireless gaming between two players.
4019428	4024796	It also features a touchscreen on the outside for interaction even when it's closed.
4024796	4025016	Hmm.
4025837	4032701	So this is very interesting that this may be the direction that the Nintendo Switch 2 is headed.
4032701	4047730	Could it be a device that collapses and looks like a switch on the outside, but then actually opens up to have a second screen, allowing, you know, basically a DS and a 3DS shop or games in the future to have two screens?
4047730	4049531	Now, I don't know.
4049531	4052573	We can dock it and then it could be the Wii U again.
4052573	4053754	We'll call it the Wii U U.
4060806	4062827	Here's the thing.
4062827	4066888	This makes a lot more sense to me in reverse.
4066888	4068589	Here's what I mean.
4068589	4083153	This patent makes a lot of sense to me if we're talking about my Switch 2 and let's say Loki's Switch 2, that when we're hanging out in person, getting together to play games in person, we can
4083973	4093755	put our Switch 2s together and turn them into this Uber Switch 2 that allows for, you know, different types of games and gaming experiences.
4093755	4103037	And the reason why my brain goes that way is because I think about just how many people have a Nintendo Switch these days and take them different places and so forth.
4103037	4109238	Wouldn't it be kind of cool if you could Transformers, basically, it's what this is, it's Nintendo Transformers.
4109238	4111819	Nintendo Transformers your system into
4113359	4116361	a jumbo system or whatever you want to call it.
4116361	4120863	It's funny, Bobby Blackwell in chat points out the Wii was just two GameCubes ducked together.
4120863	4124905	So now if you are duct taped together, so now if you get two switches duct taped together, you get 4K graphics.
4124905	4126066	Exactly.
4126066	4131008	But like maybe something not in this case, because you're going to have, you know, two.
4131008	4136791	It's there's no way that hardware is going to drive three screens like it can barely drive one.
4136791	4138372	So I yeah.
4140057	4142959	Cool, let's see what they come up with and people eat it up.
4142959	4163136	Yum, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num,
4168791	4172094	SSJ100 Matt says, just because they have a patent doesn't mean they're going to make it.
4172094	4173935	Sometimes it's to sit on an idea.
4173935	4174695	Absolutely.
4174695	4175956	And that's fine.
4175956	4179218	And Bobby points out, it's probably a defensive patent.
4179218	4180319	All that can be true.
4180319	4183401	And we can still sit here and go, hmm.
4183401	4186363	I love the patents where it's like, well, we came up with this idea.
4186363	4188105	Now nobody can do it.
4188105	4192808	Yeah, that pushes development and innovation forward.
4193749	4203121	Could Nintendo be sitting on this idea and locking down this idea where they could essentially allow you to emulate 3DS and DS games with your friend?
4203121	4209548	I just think I think the idea of like a Transformers Switch is really interesting to me, but I don't know.
4210109	4219823	I go back to my older idea that I thought the switch would make a lot of sense if they call it the switch three, even though it's the second one, but it's because it does 3d.
4219823	4221906	And it's it's three ways to switch.
4221906	4225772	It's in your hands, it's on the dock, or it's in front of your face doing VR.
4226733	4228074	That makes a lot of sense to me.
4228074	4228774	But what do I know?
4228774	4231196	I don't I don't make video game.
4231196	4232056	Just take two.
4232056	4233537	You'll split the screen in half.
4233537	4236719	You'll take one screen on one side, the other screen on the other side.
4236719	4237679	There you go.
4237679	4238660	There you go.
4238660	4240881	Duct tape it around your head.
4240881	4241882	Perfect.
4241882	4242782	Look at that field of view.
4242782	4246204	It's gonna be sticking out like a good, you know, couple feet on both sides.
4246204	4248165	You know, it'll be perfect.
4248165	4248825	Oh, Lord.
4248825	4249766	All right.
4249766	4250626	Moving on.
4250626	4251327	DarkSakura.
4253170	4263255	So, there was, I don't know if anyone remembers, in 2020 there had been a ransomware attack on Capcom.
4263255	4272760	It had confidential employee information and details on a bunch of games released on the internet.
4272760	4276422	It was performed by the RagnarLokr ransomware group.
4278423	4283348	And they were finally taken down.
4283348	4295339	They were raided in Czechia, Spain, Latvia, and I almost said Latveria, and that's comics, so forgive me, Latvia.
4297461	4310115	and the action began October 16th with the arrest of a major target in Paris that led then to a search of his Czechia home.
4312237	4320266	They also questioned five other suspects in Spain and Latvia.
4320266	4326972	And then finally they were able to pull the infrastructure from the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden.
4326972	4330997	And they basically took their dark web offline.
4330997	4331717	That was cute.
4332778	4355173	Um, and so, uh, Europol was saying that, uh, the, their ransomware, their actual, uh, software they're using that was also called RagnarLocker, um, had targeted, and this is a quote, critical infrastructure across the world, including the Portuguese national airline and an Israeli hospital.
4355173	4360376	Um, they were basically there to extort money in exchange for decryption tools.
4362418	4365900	Keep stuff from getting released online.
4365900	4376127	So it looks like that's one security breach that has been taken care of.
4376127	4381831	So I hope that anyone else out there that they can also get a hold of too.
4383632	4390378	Very interesting that this was something that went far beyond what was going on at Capcom, clearly, as much more the video games.
4390378	4392820	But I'm glad they got them.
4392820	4393340	That's for sure.
4393340	4395622	Hey, people want the money, they go where the money is.
4397236	4398717	All right, let's move on.
4398717	4404681	We're going to go to our next story, which, oh, Loki loves the things that Nintendo does.
4404681	4406782	I'm sure you have some thoughts on this.
4406782	4407923	Especially this.
4407923	4409644	This is great.
4409644	4420271	Yeah, Nintendo has now revealed a whole set of guidelines for small scale fan tournaments regarding, I think this is mostly directed at like the Smash scene.
4420871	4433938	But basically allowing, they have certain guidelines that they have to follow like down to the number of participants, the entry fees, the prize pools, all that type of stuff.
4433938	4436440	Of course, also, you know,
4438120	4443961	different guidelines regarding the use of Nintendo game footage and imagery.
4443961	4446142	Of course, one of the big ones is modified.
4446142	4447782	You know, you can't run mods.
4447782	4449983	So sorry, Smash mods.
4449983	4451043	That's a no, no.
4451043	4451743	They will.
4451743	4456405	The Nintendo police will come after you.
4456405	4462306	It's a whole set of guidelines that really feels friendly to the community.
4462306	4464167	And I hate it.
4464167	4465547	I hate all of it.
4465547	4465787	Why?
4466781	4467161	Why?
4467161	4472207	Because I feel like this is so restrictive regarding tournaments and stuff like that.
4472207	4480175	For example, I don't believe Capcom has the same type of stranglehold on the tournament scene and what people do with that.
4480175	4484299	I get it with running modded games and stuff like that.
4484299	4486401	They would probably be not okay with that.
4487122	4492103	but like just running their actual game as like a competition for things.
4492103	4502005	Like I don't think many companies care like what people are doing as long as you're not like, you know, disparaging their brand or anything like that.
4502005	4513368	They're just like so very locked down when it comes to like even like back not even that long ago when it came to just making Let's Play content with their games, they were very restrictive.
4513368	4514468	Like at some point they're like,
4514978	4516840	No, we want a cut of that money.
4516840	4517701	I remember that.
4517701	4519523	It's just it's very anti-consumer.
4519523	4526290	It's very anti just like fan like for these events.
4526290	4532516	Especially like when they're talking about like the amount of cash that like the organizer should get and stuff like that.
4532516	4537081	Well, what if they're organizing a really big event or they're organizing a really fancy event?
4537081	4537721	Why should we
4538846	4539226	even more.
4551348	4562911	So yeah, of course, you know, some of the stuff is just like legal speak, you know, like obviously you can't say it's presented by Nintendo or it's an officially endorsed by Nintendo, your events and stuff like that.
4562911	4566332	You may not use pirated or modified games or versions of your games.
4566332	4568052	I mean, that's kind of self-explanatory.
4568052	4569613	That makes sense.
4569613	4576835	Games with online play must use the online gameplay services and servers provided by the official
4577955	4585619	Nintendo group, or in other words, you can't use like Warp Pipe or something like that.
4585619	4586320	I don't know.
4586320	4588681	Like, I think it's... I don't like it.
4588681	4590922	I don't like how controlling they are with it.
4590922	4593303	This is like... I like their games.
4593303	4594344	This is Nintendo.
4594344	4595704	The company, I don't like.
4595704	4599326	I don't like the way the company operates in this sense.
4599326	4600647	They're too litigious.
4601252	4604194	Let's get some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
4604194	4611859	Mike Deft says, I was watching a video explaining all this and it seems reasonable considering that other companies have done the same before, for example, Cabcom.
4611859	4618143	DarkDesia says, there was an incident at a Street Fighter VI tournament involving a mod for Chun-Li, so that much I get.
4618143	4620365	If you look it up, it's kind of not safe for work.
4621746	4631694	Mike Deft says this is more about guidelines and keeping stuff in order than them being anti-fun and kind of refers to a video that he was watching that helps get into some of the weeds with this.
4634150	4634230	and
4651511	4655556	And there's a part of me that goes, well, no, they're not going to do that.
4655556	4660822	But I understand why people think that when these types of news stories and this whole thing comes out.
4660822	4668892	Like if you do a, what is that Smash Brothers mod that is very much piracy that adds all these other characters into the game?
4668892	4670254	What the hell is that called?
4670254	4670755	I forget.
4671255	4673455	I don't remember, but yeah, I know what you're talking about.
4673455	4674236	The Melee one.
4674236	4680417	If you run that tournament in your basement, that's not Nintendo's fucking business because it's in your house, right?
4680417	4681617	And it's that.
4681617	4684417	Is this only when like money is exchanged?
4684417	4687838	It's only community, like so, like, for example, they said community.
4687838	4697660	So what they consider a small scale, not for commercial profit tournament, it says up to 200 participants for in-person tournaments or 300 for online.
4699580	4700661	So that's still a lot.
4700661	4701863	That's a big tournament.
4701863	4705406	That's a comic book shop wouldn't get that many people at a tournament.
4705406	4707809	I know going back to like the DDR tournament days.
4707809	4710271	Did we ever get a DDR tournament with 200 people in it?
4710271	4713395	No, not even close.
4713395	4713755	No.
4713755	4714035	Yeah.
4714035	4717739	So well, wasn't there one with a 64?
4717739	4718640	But no, it still wasn't.
4718640	4722024	I would say I would say something like maybe 100 is probably the most I saw the DR days.
4722859	4750867	it would be yeah like it wouldn't it wouldn't be anything of that size so these are these are much larger tournaments like think of like a convention maybe that has okay it would have to be still a pretty large tournament even for something like that but these rules make a lot more sense like even drawing the line there i'm like okay that you are talking about much bigger like professional tournaments than you know joe's comic book shack but that but what they're saying is up to
4751767	4754948	200 participants, so like it's anything.
4754948	4759449	So, yeah, up to not 200 plus it is up to.
4759449	4761610	So there.
4761610	4767551	Yeah, they still are technically going to have to.
4767551	4772113	You'd have to adhere to that still, technically.
4772113	4776634	So if like I have two people that we're going to have a tournament, then I have to follow these rules.
4778067	4780110	but they can't control what I do in my basement.
4780110	4793266	So there's still there's still some sense of I think I think if you have probably a business that is advertising a tournament, they are taking ownership of a tournament, then that's that's the these rules apply to them.
4793266	4796189	It's like a terms of use type of thing or whatever of the game.
4796189	4797070	So yeah, yeah.
4797791	4800675	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says these are guidelines for public tournaments that are advertised.
4800675	4801656	Exactly that.
4801656	4805702	If you have something in your basement, then they can't control that.
4805702	4806743	There's no possible way.
4806743	4814453	But yeah, now, okay, if, you know, Joe's Comic Book Hut wants to do a tournament like this, then they have to kind of follow these rules.
4815216	4818458	but I wouldn't imagine a shop like that would be doing modded.
4818458	4820079	You know, now, but you know what's funny?
4820079	4827203	Now that I'm looking at all of this through a DDR lens, you know, kind of going back to, fuck, how we all met, quite frankly, isn't it funny?
4827203	4832126	Because none of the, those DDR machines, none of them were legal in the US.
4832126	4835849	Did anyone ever go to a DDR USA tournament?
4835849	4839031	I don't think, I don't think- They were legal in the sense that
4839551	4841713	Kanami turned a blind eye to it, that's how it was leaked.
4841713	4860292	Well, Kanami, it's more, it wouldn't be a legality issue for the person having the machine, it'd be a legality issue for the person, for them selling to the United States, I would think, or somebody importing it, because I don't think, it's more of a music licensing issue type of thing, whereas, like, the artists
4861397	4865098	would need to be compensated a certain way, you know, based off where it is.
4865098	4868338	I mean, you get, it's weird licensing stuff.
4868338	4876080	Um, but I, I mean, we, there's import games everywhere nowadays, especially in specific arcades that like specialize in that.
4876080	4882882	So I don't know if they're doing something different there to purchase those Japanese region games.
4882882	4889803	Um, if there's like some sort of licensing deal that they have to work out for that, maybe that's the whole emus thing, but, um,
4891676	4893297	I don't know.
4893297	4898659	But yeah, technically, technically, I guess, is gray.
4898659	4904062	Now, chatters are pointing out in multiple places that there are other companies that have these types of rules as well.
4904062	4906443	Again, going back to the Capcom comment from earlier.
4906443	4910125	So you know, fair is fair as far as the the tournaments and all that go.
4910125	4913327	But it is interesting.
4914167	4928620	this sort of legal area that it puts these smaller tournaments that really want to get the community together in small towns, you know, in places where there might only be 15 people that play this game or whatever it is.
4928620	4936586	It is interesting the impact these sorts of rules have on on that, you know, but for the most part, you know, as long as you're keeping it legal,
4937267	4937808	Thank you for watching!
4953013	4956355	And what if you were to do a tournament where the steps weren't authentic?
4956355	4963500	Like with that, I know it was a different era, but that's just kind of how they would have never approved any of that tournament.
4963500	4964340	Mm hmm.
4964340	4966802	Oh, anyway, it's just an interesting time.
4966802	4972326	The rules, the judging, the prizes.
4974847	4984153	All right, let's move on and talk a little more about old school games from somebody who has some old school perspective on the industry.
4984153	4989997	The former boss of PlayStation, Shawn Layden, has said some interesting comments this week.
4989997	4999003	Now, keep in mind, Shawn Layden left Sony in 2019, but he was on a podcast this week called, oh, hold on, I have a special delivery of coffee from my husband.
4999003	5000564	Thank you, Alan.
5000564	5001865	Alan's wearing my hoodie.
5001865	5002345	Wait, Alan,
5003848	5005889	You wanna show everybody my, the Atari hoodie?
5005889	5007469	Cause it's so cute.
5007469	5008829	And it's covered in cat hair.
5008829	5009890	That's okay, I look a mess too.
5009890	5011170	Nobody watches the show, you're fine.
5011170	5012930	That's the best way to have all your clothes be.
5012930	5014151	You're fine, look at that, look at that.
5014151	5019712	That's my Atari hoodie, and it's covered in cat hair from Cheddar, cause he likes to, yep, with the wood grain on it.
5019712	5020172	I love that.
5020172	5021873	I still need pictures of Cheddar.
5023562	5024783	Oh God, I have a million of them.
5024783	5027286	I need to just, yeah, open up a share folder and send them to you.
5027286	5032511	Anyway, where were we before I got distracted with husband bringing me a coffee?
5032511	5032672	Soda.
5032672	5033152	Ah, let's see.
5033152	5033753	Oh, yes.
5033753	5037937	So Shawn Layden was on a podcast called the Land Party Podcast.
5037937	5040900	And in comments said, I'm hoping that more
5041841	5054429	I always kind of feel bad when people get, which is ironic that I'm about to say this, I know, but I almost feel kind of bad when these executives get quoted on podcasts and it goes everywhere because it makes them apprehensive to do podcasts in the future.
5054429	5055210	But it is what it is.
5055210	5057031	They know what they're getting into by agreeing to do these things.
5058372	5065358	He said, I'm hoping that more people in the industry, certainly the big players, begin to realize there's an obligation and responsibility.
5065358	5067559	This isn't throwaway stuff we're making.
5067559	5073384	This is stuff that should be around for a long time because future generations will enjoy it in the same way that we have.
5073384	5076907	And it's criminal that we're not doing more to protect it.
5076907	5081191	Now, see, some of that was probably hyperbole based on the tone or the attitude of the podcast.
5081191	5085755	But, you know, now all those headlines are like, Shawn Layden says that it's criminal not to preserve.
5086255	5088636	Cloud Gaming.
5088636	5090936	Just fascinating how all that stuff works.
5090936	5097658	So, um, but it's also interesting because Sony's kind of been a big offender in this department in some way.
5097658	5100478	I feel like they are trying to get better and fix some of that through cloud gaming and stuff.
5100478	5105220	But it's like, I don't know, I guess if you have the hardware, it's it's fine.
5105220	5106520	But, um, yeah.
5107896	5114261	Anyway, Nintendo obviously facing criticism for closing the Wii U and the 3DS eShops.
5114261	5130993	In 2021, after Shawn Layden left, Sony announced they would be closing the PS3, Vita, and PSP digital stores, although a partial U-turn was made at some point where the PSP store was closed, but the other ones are still open, at least for a little bit longer.
5130993	5131733	So yeah, I...
5133931	5143515	It's interesting, but we need the folks that are actually on the inside to be doing things about that, for sure.
5143515	5153538	But I feel like the consumers are demanding it more, which is a good thing, because I do feel like, especially we know on Microsoft's front, they're hearing it.
5153538	5157880	They're really trying to do what they can about it, and we just need others to follow suit, for sure.
5159110	5177299	because game preservation is, you know, important and we like to do a little bit of that here on this show every week in our next segment.
5177299	5185062	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5185062	5187664	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5189278	5193719	All right, and DarkSakura, what did you pick for your game this week?
5193719	5197299	I picked Silent Hill the Arcade.
5197299	5202500	Which I've thankfully gotten to play once.
5202500	5210242	It's a lot like House of the Dead, you know, it's on rails, but it's got multiple different endings that you can get.
5210242	5215843	And I'll get to the endings in a little bit with I hope you saw the extra thing I linked you.
5215843	5218403	Yes, but it's going to be hard for me to bring up, but I'll do my best here.
5220843	5229796	It is an arcade spin-off of the Silent Hill series developed and published by Konami.
5229796	5235784	The game was revealed at the 2007 Japan Arcade Operators Union Trade Show.
5238432	5245739	It was released in Japan on July 25, 2007, and then elsewhere in 2008.
5245739	5250163	There was no US release, but it did get a European release.
5252845	5261810	So, at any rate, you use light guns to aim and shoot at your enemies, and then you shoot away to reload.
5261810	5269393	It has multiplayer elements, where you can either be one of two characters, either Eric or Tina.
5269393	5274555	A second player can join in at any time, and your progress is saved with the EMUs pass.
5276296	5283541	So, for the characters of the game, and you know, if it's a Silent Hill game, we've got some fleshed out characters.
5283541	5292086	See, I have a character named Eric, who's a protagonist, who's a 21-year-old college student studying the occult, and he's from Portland.
5293187	5296749	He used to live in Silent Hill, but moved.
5296749	5304113	He lived with his aunt and uncle since his parents died, and his grandfather was the captain of a ship called the Little Baroness.
5304113	5309056	It disappeared on Toluca Lake, so Eric wants to investigate it.
5310096	5315401	Tina is the other protagonist, also 21, and also lives in Portland.
5315401	5323207	She's studying to become a teacher, and she goes to Silent Hill to meet her pen pal, Emily.
5323207	5328992	There is another guy named Bill, and you only see him once.
5330654	5343381	Jessie, Emily, 9-year-old daughter of the Silent Hill Historical Society's chief librarian, and Tina's pen pal.
5345760	5363265	Hannah is born in 1910, a sick little girl whose mother resents her, dies in an accident on the Little Baroness, and is the antagonist of the game.
5365206	5375214	So, there's other characters that are members of the Occult Club that go to Silent Hill, and they all go missing as the story unfolds.
5375214	5384602	So, to go a little bit deeper into it, you basically check into
5385883	5403876	The Jaxx Inn and Eric has big nightmares and then in the morning he finds that Bill has been wounded and the rest of the club is missing except for Tina so they go through Silent Hill, they go to Brookhaven Hospital, they find Emily
5405208	5408653	But she's going by Hannah.
5408653	5411598	You chase her through the hospital.
5411598	5413120	You go to the other world.
5413120	5414963	The pyramid head is there.
5414963	5418508	Of course, he's there to represent concepts of punishment.
5418508	5420491	So maybe someone feels guilty for something.
5422053	5439985	But, you know, after going through the game, you eventually are going to... you get pulled through time to fight off a version of Hana who has turned into a giant monster called the Phantom.
5439985	5440585	And you...
5444674	5451199	Basically, there is some pretty disturbing scenes in there.
5453277	5466001	finds Hanna's mother, Lorraine, who she thinks is her own mother, but Lorraine throws her overboard in the lake like she did with Hanna, so she had drowned her daughter.
5466001	5470362	And that led to the little baroness sinking.
5470362	5477584	So basically, you fight Hanna as the Phantom, and there's different endings based on how well you do.
5478544	5492133	There is a good ending which you have to rescue all of your friends and shoot all of the hands and it plays the promise music from one of the games.
5492133	5498157	The normal ending plays hometown where you destroy the phantom but
5500080	5502461	There are some things that were in the good ending that aren't in that.
5502461	5504342	I don't really want to spoil it too much.
5504342	5509583	Now the bad ending is like you're stuck in Silent Hill forever with other stuff happening.
5509583	5512384	And then there's a UFO ending.
5512384	5514345	I don't know how to get it.
5514345	5520127	But the UFO ending is great because Eric's grandfather comes back on a spaceship.
5521893	5526336	And, uh, he says that you have to chase after him.
5526336	5531839	And so you set off in another spaceship and it's the Vic Viper from Gradius.
5531839	5545566	And as if you skip up a little bit more in this, as you're going through the, uh, it transitions into Robbie, the, the rabbit playing Gradius for the nest.
5545566	5546227	Yeah, that's pretty good.
5547406	5557248	Yeah, and you were basically... Yeah, it actually, like, zooms in on the Vik Viper and then pans back out to showing it morph into the window.
5557248	5561328	So, yeah, even this has a UFO ending.
5561328	5563009	That's pretty great.
5563009	5565689	You do also have different directions that you can take.
5565689	5569590	There's actually maps that were put up.
5569590	5575751	They're in Japanese, but it tells you, like, the best route to take to get, like, the hidden stuff and do the whole game.
5576791	5581676	And it's very, very in-depth.
5581676	5590224	Of course, as far as criticism that the game has received, it was considered out of place in the main series.
5590224	5596349	And it's, you know, a lot more aggressive than the typical psychological horror of the Silent Hill games.
5596349	5599492	And the voice acting isn't great.
5599492	5601634	But the game is about an hour long.
5603419	5608901	And there are, I mean, when this came out, there were lines to play it.
5608901	5620106	But they're having the other world in there and having some of the very familiar scenes from Silent Hill.
5620106	5624048	And honestly enough, it's actually a really pretty game.
5624048	5625949	I mean, it's very good looking for 2007.
5625949	5626749	Not this bug scene, gross.
5631798	5655285	yeah sorry yeah well i mean i know but it's gross i know um but i'm trying to see if i can find what it ran on um i don't see what it ran on but if i can find like a way to play this i'll have to stream through it sometime um but at any rate um
5657627	5665232	One of the wikis that I looked at does list where you can find some, although I don't know when the last time that this was updated.
5665232	5668474	Let me see if I can find a date on it.
5668474	5675938	It doesn't have the last update, but it was saying that there were locations in Puente Hills at Round 1.
5677239	5692125	and Santa Ana also at Round 1, Westfield Main Place Mall, Brookfield, Illinois at Galloping Ghost Arcade, Grapevine, Texas at Round 1, Stonecrest, Georgia at Round 1 at Stonecrest Mall.
5692125	5704170	In Europe, there's Chassonneux du Poitou in France at the Futuroscope theme park, Malaga, Spain at the Devernostrum Arcade,
5705070	5713253	Salo, Spain and PortAventura Theme Park and Bridlington at the Forum Arcade.
5713253	5724157	And then in the Philippines at Festival Mall Alabang, Amazon Block M Mall in Jakarta and Amazon Grand ITC Perma Hijau also in Jakarta.
5724157	5726317	But that might be gone.
5726317	5730919	So I challenge friends who live in any of those areas.
5730919	5731759	Take a picture.
5731759	5733020	See if you see it.
5733020	5733940	I'd love to see.
5733940	5734160	Yeah.
5735381	5737383	Now a little bit of trivia about the game.
5737383	5742269	So there are links to the other Silent Hill games in other ways.
5742269	5749657	The Little Baroness was first mentioned in Silent Hill 2 in an article you find in the Toluca Prison.
5749657	5752280	Of course, we have the inclusion of the Red Pyramid.
5753601	5766364	The Spiral Staircase, which is one of the ways that you get to the sort of time jump, is the same one that appeared in Silent Hill 4, the room that represented Walter Sullivan's inner mind.
5766364	5776607	And the original voice actor of James Sunderland in Silent Hill 2, Guy Chihi, has played the game.
5776607	5779948	So, yay.
5779948	5780748	But yeah, it's...
5781821	5784963	It's a, it's a neat looking machine.
5784963	5791305	It's got like this sort of tattered canopy around the shooting cabinet.
5791305	5793507	Um, I only have like one small picture.
5793507	5796188	So if you look it up, you'll see what I mean.
5796188	5806192	But, um, you know what, you know, this makes me think of as far as the graphic style on it, it makes me think of an Almy game.
5806192	5809394	You know, that's why I want to know what hardware it's running on.
5812246	5815628	In chat, they say it's just PC-based hardware, says Orange, right?
5815628	5816848	PC-based hardware?
5816848	5821031	Okay, well then she should be able to run it.
5821031	5824973	Yeah, but at any rate, that's the game.
5824973	5826594	Silent Hill the arcade.
5827455	5833616	Yeah, I saw one of these once and I thought the pyramid head thing looked so cool, like obviously an iconic figure from the Silent Hill series.
5833616	5841878	And yeah, I never played it though, which considering how scary some of those bug sequences are, I think I'm, I think I'm kind of glad I didn't.
5841878	5849580	So yeah, but there, there it is your classic game of the week, Silent Hill, the arcade version.
5849580	5851600	So we will move on from that.
5852120	5871175	Sorry to those watching live on Twitch while I get the video back up and running But I had to do some magic there to get the UFO ending to be able to show because that was important So it is important and I guess you just Wink wink nudge nudge.
5871175	5874078	What found found the game.
5874078	5875479	Oh, there you go.
5875479	5875739	Nice.
5875739	5875779	Oh
5877008	5878549	That'll be a fun one to stream at some point.
5878549	5879289	Anyway.
5879289	5879910	All right.
5879910	5882131	Appropriate for the season as well.
5882131	5885053	Yeah, DarkTortillas is worth it for the Gradius reference.
5885053	5886173	Yeah.
5886173	5886553	Agree.
5886553	5887354	Agree.
5887354	5895899	All right, we are going to move on to some rapid fire news and cover some news going on in the industry rather rapidly.
5895899	5899341	I think I'm switching it up and start with DarkSakura tonight, if I remember right.
5899341	5901122	So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?
5902033	5906818	I thought I was, we were just switching the story but I'll go ahead and talk about it.
5906818	5916508	So a game that I am very fond of playing is Disney Dream Night Valley and all the talk had been that it was going to be free to play.
5916508	5917469	That is not the case.
5919705	5926988	Gameloft decided that they're not going to go through with the free-to-play plan.
5926988	5933471	With what they've learned from Early Access, so they say, they've made the decision to remain a paid game for the foreseeable future.
5935132	5946082	So, if you want the game, there are different founders packs, and when the game launches on December 5th, there will still be the three different editions.
5946082	5950547	So there's the standard edition for $39.99, that's a digital copy of the game, and $8,000 Moonstones.
5952248	5967882	The gold edition for $69.99, which I think also is the ultimate edition on Steam right now, is the digital copy of the full game, Expansion Pass, 15,000 Moonstones, Flowery, Capybara, Companion,
5968622	5973645	a flowery summer cottage house style and artist's overalls, avatar costume.
5973645	5978488	And then there's the Cozy Edition, which is a retail exclusive for $49.99.
5978488	5990175	That's the physical copy of the game, 14,500 Moonstones, cottage house skin, five raccoon companion skins, a Cheshire Cat sweater, one of six posters, and a sticker sheet.
5990175	5992757	So, yeah.
5992757	5995139	I have a lot of fun playing it, but I'm a little pissed off at it.
5996249	6009906	Because there is one very short, teensy bit of music that apparently has triggered Twitch to give me one of those little warnings and mute the channel, you know, mute that part of the stream.
6009906	6014912	And it's all the music for when you upgrade a building.
6014912	6015312	That's all.
6017969	6022996	So while I will still be streaming the game I will not be keeping my VODs up for it.
6033268	6033868	Thanks for watching!
6058755	6063682	Alright, so apparently there's been an announcement from Annapurna Interactive.
6063682	6071452	They're going to do a collection of 12 of their games for $200 on a single Switch cartridge.
6073444	6076787	So that's pretty amazing that they could fit that all in one cartridge.
6076787	6082893	It is being done, of course, through IM8Bit, and there's only going to be 2,500 copies available.
6082893	6086457	So you got to get in on that because they started pre-orders four days ago.
6086457	6090121	So, you know, good luck.
6090121	6094885	It's supposed to be shipping sometime next year.
6094885	6095966	Cool.
6095966	6097348	I don't think I'll be getting that.
6098226	6103330	And then Dead Cells is getting a brand new Netflix edition.
6103330	6104491	What is that exactly?
6104491	6112717	Well, of course, Netflix, you may remember, offers games as part of a service that nobody seems to play, but Dead Cells is going to be part of it.
6112717	6118661	And as part of this edition that's going to be available on October 31st, it will basically it's like a game of the year edition.
6118661	6124645	It basically has all the DLC included with it, including the Castlevania stuff, because that's including the Castlevania stuff.
6124645	6125266	Nice, nice.
6126446	6133409	So yeah, so if you have a Netflix subscription, you get access to all of these games on both iOS and Android devices.
6133409	6137510	I don't hear PC in there, so no thanks.
6137510	6138490	All right.
6138490	6149034	Well, Sony, you might remember, took some shit a few months ago, and quite frankly, rightfully so, because they jacked up the price of PlayStation Plus up by like 35%, right?
6149034	6151655	We saw a lot of tiers go way up.
6151655	6151915	Well,
6153055	6165899	the Senior Vice President and Head of Global Marketing, Eric Lempel, was doing an interview with Barron's and was asked to basically explain what are these price hikes all about.
6165899	6169500	And in a comment, he said, we want to make PlayStation Plus great.
6169500	6176282	With our reboot last year and introducing the tier system, a lot of consumers have recognized that there's a lot of value in PlayStation 5.
6176282	6181744	Like practically everything else in the world, we have to look at our pricing and we have to adjust to market conditions.
6182324	6190171	I'm happy to say, unlike a lot of other subscription services out there, we haven't touched the PlayStation Plus pricing for 85% of the world in many years.
6190171	6193234	So this was the first time we did something there.
6193234	6198158	It should be pointed out, to be fair, Microsoft did raise the price of Game Pass in July.
6198158	6202942	Granted, it wasn't quite the same level of hike, but okay.
6202942	6206966	In the interview, Lempel was also asked for thoughts on Game Pass.
6208035	6213880	saying, quote, it comes down to what you're going to get in the service in terms of the type of game and the quality of games.
6213880	6222969	I can't comment on what the competition is doing, but with us, we feel we're offering a great curated catalog of games, as well as other features and services with PlayStation Plus.
6222969	6229375	Also, we give you the options with the three tiers to engage as much or as little as you want, depending on what you'd like to do.
6229955	6233637	It's a very different offering, but it's one that resonated with consumers.
6233637	6241603	Since we introduced the tier, we've seen a third of the Plus user base opt for the upper two tiers, which is more than we expected.
6241603	6244344	So at the end of the day, I guess the consumers have spoken.
6245356	6251397	Here's the thing, if this news pisses you off, you have to be willing to vote with your wallet.
6251397	6260279	And it's very clear, so many people are not, I mean, you can't really see, in that figure he's quoting, you don't really see the result of the price increase yet.
6260279	6265360	But you have to be willing to let some of that go if you want to really send a message.
6265360	6269781	Because honestly, I really feel like a lot of what he's saying there in that comment, he doesn't comment on
6270521	6290749	the quality of this sure he offered he says well we have these multiple tiers we're doing these extra thing which they charge more money for in the first place so i'm not hearing what you're saying there and then basically says lol inflation everyone else is doing it why can't we everyone else did it by a dollar
6293743	6307038	SSJ100 Matt makes a very interesting parallel in chat saying they stole this response from the MTA, New York City Mass Transit's playbook to justify fair hikes while meanwhile adding nothing to the experience.
6307038	6309762	Ranma, who also lives in New York, says this.
6310984	6316426	Questbuster says, I guess I'll buy an annual renewal every Black Friday on eBay.
6316426	6318107	Vary that.
6318107	6322389	If I am going to renew, if Black Friday will be the day that I do it.
6322389	6325330	That's the only day I feel like I'm going to be able to find it a reasonable price.
6325330	6331853	But now, now I'm worried they're going to kind of know, and maybe I'm not going to find a good price there.
6331853	6332533	We'll see.
6332533	6334354	Let's see.
6334354	6334594	Anyway.
6335956	6345580	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games I suppose you can play online with these very expensive services that let you play online.
6345580	6348622	Let's start with the U.S., Loki.

6354304	6357546	The Foglands on PlayStation 5 and Quest 2.
6357546	6362768	I'm assuming that's the PlayStation VR, but you know, he doesn't mention that.

6558810	6563252	Uh, that's a lot of games, but, um, granted we're getting into November at this point.
6563252	6566654	Don't worry, there's like two or three more weeks and then that's right.
6566654	6569095	And then dry up till January.
6569095	6570116	Yeah.
6570116	6570516	All right.
6570516	6573558	Well, let's look at Japan and see what the release pattern is over there.
6573558	6576359	Uh, not as busy as here, but still pretty busy.
6576359	6577520	Actually.
6577520	6578540	Uh, Nintendo switch.
6578540	6582602	We'll see the release in Japan of Gensou Skydrift on the switch.
6582602	6585444	Uh, the Fox awaits Mihana, uh, Fashion Dreamer.

6607421	6608922	My Time at Sandrock.
6609562	6630350	some new amiibo figures for Tears of the Kingdom for Zelda and Ganondorf will be releasing this week as well and Pokemon Scarlet plus the hidden treasure of Area Zero so I'm assuming that is a DLC and the game kind of combo pack for those that are interested in that some new Nintendo Switch Lite patterns are coming out as well
6630970	6631330	DarkSakura.
6661840	6669906	So on the second, for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, we have The Invincible.

6704116	6707440	And for the three, Jumanji Wild Adventures.
6710786	6737394	all right that's it uh then with that we will move back into a few more stories but we'll be inviting you all to participate with our show a little bit later on but first we want to get through a few more headlines so we'll go back over to Loki yes so we have news that Media Molecule has laid off 15 to 20 percent of their staff apparently they put out a message regarding this saying Media Molecule has made significant strategic changes during the past year including
6737802	6750876	Shifting our focus from Dreams to our new project, and we've had to make the difficult decision to begin with the consultation process for team members within certain departments of the studio.
6750876	6756062	I think they meant consolidation, because consultation process, that doesn't make any sense.
6756762	6761367	This is a tough moment for the individuals impacted and the studios overall.
6761367	6769395	Every single role has been put at risk or delivered by someone who contributed something special to Media Molecule.
6769395	6774421	We will make sure that those impacted receive the best support we can during this process.
6776587	6779229	So that's unfortunate.
6779229	6780109	That is unfortunate.
6780109	6784412	But I think just kind of goes to show that Dreams maybe didn't quite hit the expectation.
6784412	6787314	But I mean, I feel like that game was so... They didn't push it at all.
6787314	6788054	Nobody pushed it.
6788054	6789015	You're right.
6789015	6789855	Like that.
6789855	6794678	I don't understand why Sony literally slept on that game.
6794678	6795078	It's wild.
6795078	6796639	They treated it like the Vita.
6796639	6796960	I mean,
6797660	6798340	and somebody else said
6821309	6823050	Oh, we're trying to do all these things.
6823050	6825432	And then the reality is not so much.
6825432	6828593	So here's hoping everybody learns to be nice about it.
6828593	6830655	Certain people in charge could take a pay cut.
6830655	6832376	That that is also very true.
6832376	6835237	So because it would be their failure as leadership.
6835237	6842782	Um, since I know this is a British based company, aren't the lay like the laws around redundancies and all that stuff?
6842782	6843942	Aren't they a little stricter over there?
6843942	6848865	Like as far as like regulatory, the things they have to do and report with that?
6848865	6849806	Not yet.
6849806	6849946	Hmm.
6850919	6855642	Alright, uh, well let's move on, DarkSakura.
6855642	6861166	So, um, for the next Awesome Games Done Quick, there's gonna be a new speedrunner.
6861166	6862787	Ashiba Inu, named Peanutbutter.
6866986	6880375	This particular dog, with a little bit of guidance from his human, plays Gyromite.
6880375	6891743	It's going to be a remote play, because Puppers needs to be at home and not nervous around a bunch of strangers.
6894395	6900571	Yeah, we're gonna have a pupper do us a run.
6902776	6903736	I think it's cute.
6903736	6909259	I think it's fascinating, too, in a way, it's taken this long to see something a little bit mainstream.
6909259	6920924	And what I mean by that is, because if the game is Gyromite, then essentially I'm assuming the dog is kind of doing the role of Rob the Robot, which is literally hold this, hold this, hold that.
6920924	6922244	It is very simple.
6922244	6926086	It's basically as human as holding up treats on the button to press.
6927938	6932823	And I still think that it's adorable.
6932823	6940331	Oh, and then according to Bobby in chat, JSR is going to be getting on a plane to do Zelda 2 in person.
6940331	6941953	Oh, wow.
6941953	6944316	I want to see a cat do one of those speedruns.
6944316	6946378	Of course, that would be an even more difficult task.
6946378	6948280	A cat would never obey its owner longer.
6948280	6948740	You know what?
6950482	6955984	I would have Midna speedrun something I hate, which would be just to not run it.
6955984	6959926	Her response would be just to sit on the controller and cancel the game.
6959926	6961006	Yeah.
6961006	6963867	Cats aren't going to do anything a human wants them to do.
6963867	6965768	That's the number one rule of cats.
6965768	6968549	Midna might throw up on a game.
6968549	6968889	She might.
6969810	6970991	That's going to be super cute though.
6970991	6980417	And you know, actually I, you know, when, if you think about Game Stunt Quick and the fact that it really is about the speed runners and the charity, right?
6980417	6985100	A stunt like this, because it's kind of a stunt, but it's, it's the cool kind of stunt.
6985100	6987762	Like, you know, it's, it's, it's the kind we're okay with.
6987762	6994267	A stunt like this is going to get a lot more eyes on GDQ and ultimately donating to the charity.
6994267	6998550	And that whole thing, there will be people that want to get their names read during that speed run and so forth.
6998550	6998690	So,
6999931	7008038	I think it's a very clever idea to, you know, mix it up a little bit and getting, you know, getting more people involved.
7008038	7009459	It's a cute pupper.
7009459	7011180	Yeah.
7011180	7012381	Very cute doggo.
7012381	7013482	Yeah.
7013482	7014523	Very good boy.
7014523	7020368	Bobby is doing a frown saying since it's a remote run, I won't be able to host for it if I get selected.
7020368	7023250	It's at 3pm Eastern on Tuesday.
7023250	7025052	You could be before or after.
7025052	7025913	So don't give up hope.
7027881	7028761	All right.
7028761	7040086	I do love, though, and I love how they are continuing to leverage the remote runs with the in-person runs, like, in a way that allows both to kind of run, you know, seamlessly.
7040086	7042847	It's, yeah, it's a good idea.
7042847	7044028	All right.
7044028	7045688	Well, here's what I think.
7045688	7049430	You know that you can teach a cat to use a soundboard, right?
7049430	7050410	Right.
7050410	7052231	And they can communicate with you.
7052231	7052431	Mm-hmm.
7054770	7059091	would think that it could be indeed possible to teach a cat to play a video game.
7059091	7060671	I'm just gonna say that right now.
7060671	7063912	I'm not gonna try that with Midna because she's old.
7063912	7071254	But my next cat is going to be taught to play DDR.
7071254	7073135	Yeah, my cat's gonna be no help either.
7073135	7076875	Mr. Smush would just sleep and Cheddar would just cry.
7076875	7078736	That's all that's gonna do.
7078736	7082757	I still think you should get Mr. Smush a David Bowie costume because he has the eyes.
7084690	7085351	Seriously!
7085351	7087274	No, I know, it's funny.
7087274	7089418	You could call him, uh, Smushy Bowie.
7090830	7098836	Bobby is also pointing out that if you haven't seen the schedule for Games Done Quick yet, AGDQ, it is posted over at gamesdonequick.com.
7098836	7101898	I think that was one of those things that came out while we were on break.
7101898	7105481	So if you want to see the full schedule, it is there.
7105481	7110144	The hosting part is not filled out yet, but I'm assuming we'll get to know that in the coming weeks as well.
7110144	7115868	I guess if you think about it, if we're getting into November, we're only like two months away.
7115868	7117189	Man, time flies sometimes.
7117189	7117689	It really does.
7118630	7130597	Anyway, let's go back to a game we were talking about earlier in the show and Loki, some interesting comments on this game.
7130597	7138341	Yeah, so Starfield, it's.
7138341	7146466	You know, they may have made it a bit smaller or they said smaller may have been better, because I think
7147481	7159487	What some of the complaints have been so far with the game has been that, hey, you know, it's procedurally generated and there's a lot of like it was a thousand planets or whatever, but they're all kind of empty.
7159923	7162825	There's not a lot to do there.
7162825	7168068	And since it's procedurally generated, you know, you kind of run across the same type of stuff over and over.
7168068	7182116	So one of the former employee, Bethesda employee, Bruce Nesmith, who worked on Starfield as a senior systems designer, talked about their decision to go so massive with it.
7182116	7183777	In an interview, he said that
7184830	7190904	The player expectations around the size of Bethesda Open World Games influence the team to opt for this approach.
7193280	7199683	But you know, also, like, I don't think anybody was necessarily saying that it had to be a thousand different planets and stuff.
7199683	7210867	I don't think anyone's really put that expectation out there, but basically said that, hey, Todd Howard pretty much pulled the number 100 for the number of solar systems out of thin air.
7210867	7221752	But the more we went on, the more it was like, OK, so all core activity takes place in these two dozen unsettled systems and the rest is open space.
7222512	7224413	People love our big games.
7224413	7226294	They love that open area to explore.
7226294	7229977	So let's go ahead and let them have at it.
7229977	7237741	I think some exploration stuff didn't come through as well as it could have because they decided to make other choices and never misunderstand this.
7237741	7243024	In every game studio on the face of this planet, they know the choices that they're making.
7243024	7248488	They know the things that are not going to be in there and they know what players are going to moan about.
7248488	7250249	But you got to make the hard choice.
7250249	7250449	Yeah.
7252154	7254817	I feel like Starfield felt like it was obligated to emulate No Man's Sky.
7268231	7272655	at this point, you know, that it's it is so I wonder if they felt because it's interesting.
7272655	7280240	The early concepts of Mass Effect Andromeda, if you, you know, buy into that stuff was supposed to be a similar thing was that it was going to be all these planets to explore.
7280240	7290408	But they scaled back on that and made it, you know, just the, you know, narrative based planets, which probably was a good thing, despite, you know, how mixed whatever that game may have ultimately been by folks.
7290408	7292490	But yeah, I'm with E3VL.
7292490	7297394	I'd rather have 100 quality planets made by devs than a thousand procedurally generated ones.
7297394	7297554	Yeah.
7297654	7303400	And I love No Man's Sky, and I love the procedurally generated universe of No Man's Sky, but that game is based around that.
7303400	7305102	It's based around exploring the unknown.
7305102	7307225	It's not a narrative game so much.
7307225	7313051	And it's not like anyone had the expectation of, oh, there's a thousand planets that you're going to be able to explore.
7313051	7317416	They put that in our heads because they told us this is what you're going to get.
7317416	7318998	Like if they said, hey,
7320095	7327281	They'd made it more like kind of along the lines of like a Mass Effect game where there's a limited number of planets to explore.
7327281	7330323	I mean, yeah, it's not necessarily like walking around.
7330323	7346296	I mean, it would be like, imagine like Skyrim, but like taking the map, splitting it up a bit and it's having, you know, you fly between different planets and you could still make each one of those planets extensive, like large areas to explore, but you didn't have to like make
7347461	7348402	Thanks for watching!
7365990	7372215	because it's all generated procedurally, it could be different every time you go down there.
7372215	7380200	And so, like, if I go down to a planet and someone else goes down to that same planet, it could look different because it's all procedurally generated.
7380200	7383162	And so that becomes a problem, too, I think.
7383162	7390388	In this case, No Man's Sky, it's perfectly fine because, you know, that's the game.
7390388	7392289	Whereas this is a narrative game and
7393348	7404121	You know, there should be some well-crafted stories and areas, not necessarily just, oh, hey, there's another settlement that needs your help, Fallout 4 type of thing.
7405539	7409841	Questbuster in chat points out an interesting sort of cycle to this whole thing.
7409841	7420066	Questbuster says this was the same problem that Bethesda's older RPGs like Daggerfall, which used procedural generation to create land, towns, and villages between the major cities of the region.
7420066	7428030	Everything started feeling the same after a while, even the dungeons, but it was an impressive selling point for just how much you could explore.
7428030	7431052	Interesting that maybe this has always been Bethesda's kind of
7434160	7455913	Anyway, well, I don't know what better note to end our Halloween episode on or this time of year than this story, and that has to do with the Diablo 4 promotion, where if enough folks donate blood, Blizzard is going to raffle off a human blood infused PC.
7457523	7458904	What?
7458904	7459564	No.
7459564	7460764	Yeah, that's stupid.
7460764	7464806	Giving blood also will earn players in game rewards, which is cute.
7464806	7468207	But don't worry, the donations are actually going to like places that need them.
7468207	7470868	It's not like Blizzard is just collecting them for fun.
7470868	7477111	So this ties into the current season that Blizzard rolled out for Diablo, the season of blood.
7477111	7483413	And it is a month long blood drive in the US and in game rewards will be unlocked as more people participate.
7483413	7483933	Once 666 quarts
7486374	7488654	of course, are donated.
7488654	7497376	Players can enter a sweepstakes for a custom liquid-cooled PC infused with real human blood.
7497376	7497896	No.
7497896	7500517	I'm laughing, just saying how silly this is.
7500517	7502597	Isn't that illegal, like under biohazard laws?
7502597	7512719	Well, I remember when, and Jason references in the intro, Lil Nas X tried to do those shoes, which was a similar thing, and that got shut down.
7514560	7522907	But I think that had to do with Nike did not agree to the whole thing, and I think that's why that got shut down.
7522907	7529313	I'd be less concerned about that and more concerned about that it's just not going to work well.
7529313	7531755	Clearly, this is not something that they tested well.
7534341	7539785	I just don't see that as a viable cooling solution, but sure.
7539785	7541206	Here's my thing.
7541206	7553914	So they say the custom PC is a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, an Intel Core i9 CPU, 64 gigs of RAM, 3 terabyte SSD storage, and the Quantum Vector GPU water block for cooling.
7553914	7558477	Now they don't say how the whole blood thing works, but is it like
7559438	7585668	if I just take my like diabetes check needle and just get like one little drop of blood and put it can would I be able to say it's infused with blood like is that is that what it is one little in the system I still feel like even just that microscopic amount could ruin everything though so I'd be curious yeah because typically you like okay so normally you would want to like put a liquid in there that's not going to
7586923	7587544	Thanks for watching!
7605768	7608010	I would say Bobby's got a good idea what it probably is.
7608010	7611212	My theory is that it's in the plastic mold or something.
7611212	7613113	Yeah, and Bobby's kind of piggybacking on that.
7613113	7613794	That's a good idea.
7613794	7617676	And Bobby says they could probably infuse an emblem on the case or something with it.
7617676	7623080	Not actually a part of the operation, but your theory is very good as well.
7623080	7624041	So, yeah.
7625001	7626482	That's also stupid.
7626482	7629084	Oh my god, SSJ100 Matt, you need to stop.
7629084	7647758	The comment DarkSakura is responding to from the podcast listeners is, this doesn't sound like a positive promotion, but I might be negative on this whole thing.
7647758	7649700	I wish I could play one of my soundbites.
7651636	7653658	All right, well, let's get to the list.
7653658	7656802	The BBC would like to apologize.
7656802	7664030	Let's get to the listener roundtable and take your calls, comments and so forth over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
7664030	7666252	If you have something you want us to talk about.
7666252	7667233	I noticed this comment, too.
7667233	7669956	I want to read from Artie McPhearse, who followed us tonight.
7669956	7670677	By the way, hello.
7670677	7671218	Thank you for being here.
7671778	7673839	saying Activision- Artie is a friend.
7673839	7674579	Nice.
7674579	7681143	Activision Blizzard amazes me of how much they are far from how they used to be when they were just Blizzard.
7681143	7684904	These promotions are not going to work out the way they want.
7684904	7687666	Nope.
7687666	7698471	Yeah, I mean, I won't be giving blood anytime soon, but that's because supposedly I have to abstain from in order to be able to donate blood, and I'm not going to do that.
7698471	7700372	I can't anyway because of my mom.
7701872	7706114	Thanks for the antibodies, mom!
7706114	7713896	If you want to call us on Discord, vognetwork.com is the place to join our Discord.
7713896	7718758	You can join the green room and we will pull some calls on air.
7718758	7722499	We usually take this opportunity to check in with a mailbag as well.
7722499	7726001	Don't think we had anything, but I'll double check that.
7726001	7729042	Honestly, I'm kind of grateful with how my throat feels.
7729995	7733097	But if you want to send us an email for a future week, we always invite that.
7733097	7738021	Participate at orangelaundryday.com is the place to send an email.
7738021	7742624	Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.
7742624	7743945	I don't have any last minute stories.
7743945	7751191	I was just going through the legalese on that blood harvesting to see how if they actually defined how it was infused with blood.
7751191	7751751	They do not.
7753606	7761491	I think y'all are right that it's something to do with the cosmetic portion of the PC as opposed to the actual inner parts of the PC.
7761491	7763112	I think that's what it is.
7763112	7768655	Like, note, contains .000001 from one tech who had a nosebleed over the plastic mold.
7768655	7769195	Yeah, I know.
7769195	7774838	It's like, yeah, and literally, how do you get somebody to be like, okay, it's your blood that's going in the PC?
7774838	7775339	Like, did they,
7776806	7778407	did they get a celebrity to do it?
7778407	7785453	Like, we apparently, um, you didn't say if it was human either some time ago, and I don't know why they just caught a pigeon.
7785453	7788055	I don't know why the fucking Saw movies keep coming up.
7788055	7790637	But it was Saw two or Saw three.
7790637	7799424	I remember this was a thing they actually got Tobin Bell to put blood in the paint that went on the posters for Saw two or three.
7799424	7806270	Now like again, it's like one or two drops but mixed with the paint so they could say his blood is on every poster basically.
7808098	7810699	Well, no, that would have to be in the ink.
7810699	7812821	Yeah, I was gonna say that doesn't work, but whatever.
7812821	7821426	Yeah, and I'm trying to think of knowing what I know about print processing.
7821426	7822827	I mean, I guess it could work.
7822827	7823707	Yeah.
7823707	7832052	But it would, depending on how much was used, it would absolutely change the consistency and, what's the word I'm thinking of?
7835106	7835206	Saw 3.
7835206	7840910	President of theatrical marketing Tim Palin thought of the idea to make 1,000 posters with a small amount of Belle's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink.
7853740	7856442	He said, I asked if it would be possible to use actual blood.
7856442	7857243	There was silence.
7857243	7858204	He said, We could try.
7858204	7859064	But are you serious?
7859064	7860605	I said, I was dead serious.
7860605	7867331	The posters were sold for $20 with the first being auctioned off and the proceeds from the auction poster were donated to the Red Cross.
7867331	7871574	Lionsgate also held the third annual GiveTiloHertz blood drive, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7871574	7876057	So and I'm reading that because it's a very similar gimmick.
7876057	7880661	It's a blood drive to promote something and they use actual blood and part of it.
7882386	7883151	I know, it's weird.
7883151	7885205	No thank you.
7885205	7885729	It's strange.
7886141	7886782	No, thank you.
7886782	7887522	I'm sorry.
7887522	7890404	I'm fine with not having any potential biohazards.
7890404	7894967	You know, I have enough of them in my house.
7894967	7899410	Arty McPherson chat says, Oh, just saw that headline of the seventh guest in VR.
7899410	7900851	And that actually intrigues me.
7900851	7901191	Oh, yes.
7901191	7903052	Those taglines that go along the bottom.
7903052	7912278	Yeah, that's a VR experience of the seventh guest was supposed to come out soon, which obviously is a classic, classic 90 CD-ROM game, but obviously reimagined for the VR world.
7914039	7915581	I'd be curious to check that out.
7915581	7919584	I don't really own any current VR platforms.
7919584	7925730	Excuse me, I have PlayStation VR, but I haven't hooked that up since I moved into this house, so I don't see myself
7926880	7928802	Grabbing that anytime soon.
7928802	7929922	I did think it was interesting, though.
7929922	7937929	One of the vendors that was exhibiting at TwitchCon, going back to that a little bit, was Facebook, or Meta, if you will, showing the MetaQuest 3.
7937929	7939470	I thought that was interesting.
7939470	7942672	They were really trying to get people to get on that a little bit.
7942672	7944474	I was going nowhere near it.
7944474	7947396	It's just my depth perception issues.
7947396	7948617	3D hits me.
7948617	7949898	And I figured out what it is.
7949898	7952400	It's just that I see too much of the 3D.
7952400	7953400	Does that make sense?
7953400	7953580	Sure.
7954713	7962037	Yeah, like my eyes are really sensitive to that.
7962037	7971163	I was just reading comments in chat here, PodCulture pointing out Kiss did that back in the 70s for a comic, which I'm assuming is a reference to the Blood and Ink thing.
7971163	7976966	Yeah, I took Bobby's 3D vision and added it to, you know, to my own collective.
7978948	7979948	All right.
7979948	7983629	Well, I think with that, we're going to move to wrap up the show tonight.
7983629	7986590	I hope everybody has a great Halloween though.
7986590	7992551	I'm sure most of you probably did your events this weekend, but for anybody that's going out on Tuesday night, I hope you all have fun.
7992551	7997753	Thank you all for being here tonight and listening to our show or listening throughout the week as the case may be.
7997753	8000133	We really appreciate you all being here.
8000133	8003354	Thank you ever and always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting the show.
8003354	8006515	If you enjoyed what you heard here, please tell a friend or two, help us spread the word.
8006775	8010377	DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
8036480	8037942	Yeah, I like the whole void thing.
8037942	8039264	I think that's actually pretty fun.
8039264	8045291	And I've had some, some pretty, you know, interesting people want to, like some killers want to actually farm.
8045291	8052120	And of course, I love when you get a farming killer when it's just, you know, running around and being cooperative and hilarious.
8052120	8053722	Can killers get you in the void?
8055143	8059426	Yeah, actually, for everyone in the void, your powers don't work.
8059426	8061067	You can't, you know, heal.
8061067	8062528	You can't do anything.
8062528	8065630	And if they hook you in the void, then you show up on the map.
8065630	8073035	And the interesting thing is the way it's laid out is when you're on a map and you look up, you see that big black spiral, the purple and black spiral.
8073035	8075817	And that's actually where the map is, the void map.
8075817	8077198	Oh, interesting.
8077198	8084723	So you can actually hear a terror radius when they're in the general same vicinity as you as if you were on one of the two story maps.
8086844	8094526	But yeah, I'm gonna play some Debbie as long as I feel up to it.
8094526	8104969	I may not stream the whole time I play, I'll put it that way, but I'm gonna mostly do Killer, but if anyone wants to hop on some Savuvar, I can be convinced.
8104969	8112812	I just have to finish two Killer things so that I can get the Knight's weapon.
8114950	8118114	So yeah, I'll be off to the Debbies.
8118114	8119555	Bye, everyone.
8119555	8119976	All right.
8119976	8120556	Have a good night.
8120556	8121557	DarkSakura, we'll see you next week.
8121557	8122318	You too.
8122318	8123279	Bye.
8123279	8123940	All right.
8123940	8128045	Well, with that, we will move on to Loki and your final thought tonight.
8128045	8132069	My final thought is hopefully there'll be more Minecraft content coming out for me later this week.
8132069	8133891	So look for that.
8133891	8134311	Sounds good.
8135397	8137999	My final thought, I don't know, I don't have a lot.
8137999	8155233	I guess on a non-gaming note, I was able to host yet another Rocky Horror Picture Show last night and it was sold out and it was a great feeling and I've just, I've really been enjoying doing all these like live hosting things, but that was my last one for the year, so I'm hoping that some really good stuff is ahead for next year.
8155233	8163000	Exciting times and looking to do more conventions and all that stuff and trying to amp up some of that in-person stuff.
8163000	8164080	Always a good feeling, so.
8164801	8165362	That's it.
8165362	8167703	Thank you so much for listening to our show this week.
8167703	8169465	We appreciate you all for being here.
8169465	8172427	Have a wonderful week, trick or treat.
8172427	8176210	And we'll see you next time in November, believe it or not.
8176210	8179613	And by this time next week, Mariah Carey will be dethawed.
8179613	8180894	Look out, everybody.
8180894	8182416	Have a good night, everybody.
8182416	8183617	Oh my god, Diddy Archaholic.
8183617	8185438	Hi, good to see you.
