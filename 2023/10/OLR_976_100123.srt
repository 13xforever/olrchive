00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:16,387
[SPEAKER_00]: PSA to the United States, listeners, there's going to be a test of the emergency alert systems this Wednesday, October 4th at 11.20am Pacific.

2
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:20,549
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that your and everyone else's phones is going to make that very attention-grabbing screech.

3
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:23,830
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this after October 4th, sorry about your ears and heart rate.

4
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,411
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Public Awareness Intro.

5
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:29,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you about gaming news!

6
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:33,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:34,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

8
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:35,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And... Happy 25th, DDR!

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:54,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and thank you Jason for that lovely PSA at the top of the show.

12
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:55,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a show.

13
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:00,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful if you're if you're deep into playing video games or MMOs or something and that alarm goes off.

14
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: don't say we didn't warn you here at OLR.

15
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:05,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, hi, I'm Rob Roberts.

16
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:15,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here every week to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with all of you live at Twitch, and through you know, email and all that good stuff throughout the week.

17
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:22,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with my co host, of course, every week, you know, save for a holiday week here and there, but back all night tonight.

18
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:25,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everybody.

20
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:28,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how are you doing?

21
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:30,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired.

22
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that.

23
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:34,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm because I'm stupid.

24
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:36,847
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a nice thing to say about yourself.

25
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say what I want to about myself.

26
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but I don't agree.

27
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:41,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not agree.

28
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so well, smart people can do stupid things.

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that is very true.

30
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

31
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:56,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I met up with my friend Alicia for lunch as we say pie even if we don't get pie we go to Sherry's.

32
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,431
[SPEAKER_03]: and Amazing Pumpkin Pancakes.

33
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:08,419
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I got home and I was like, oh shit, I haven't done any of my turnout exercises today.

34
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:14,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I've got recital coming up in December and I'm really trying to step up my ballet game.

35
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did 20 minutes of barre right before we went live.

36
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you're probably pretty sore as well as tired.

37
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:21,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I'm not.

38
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:22,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sore.

39
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:29,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, my my ankles are getting a little tight now from just, you know, chilling a bit.

40
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,573
[SPEAKER_03]: But but no, my.

41
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:37,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a little bit tired because I did like a hundred plies, a hundred eleves.

42
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a hundred tendu en croix.

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some grand battement.

44
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:44,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a couple of arabesque.

45
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:46,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I did lots of stretching and I did in 20 minutes.

46
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Insert more French words here!

47
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:56,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do all those things so you can eat more macarons.

48
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

49
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:58,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

50
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but when I put it in my food tracker it says you get to eat 200 more calories today, unlike chocolate.

51
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,193
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, chocolate macaron.

52
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:08,354
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is weird.

53
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:16,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, you're talking about your ritual, one of your like ritual Sunday things and, and Alan, my husband has a ritual Sunday thing too.

54
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,096
[SPEAKER_02]: He always does a Costco trip.

55
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:24,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we are taping this live, he literally just sent me a message on our app that we chat on saying, you're doing the show.

56
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:25,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck my drag.

57
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a literal quote.

58
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:34,840
[SPEAKER_02]: But and then sends me this these pictures from Costco of this thing called a My Arcade by Atari, which I've never

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not seen these before.

60
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:41,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not the same thing we talked about on the show recently, like Atari is doing their own thing.

61
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:51,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But my arcade, who makes those little arcade machines that you've probably seen my collection of before, I guess they make a whole little flashback type of console.

62
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got my DVR one.

63
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:54,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right, right.

64
00:03:54,921 --> 00:04:02,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've got this one, which it looks more like the new school kind of Atari than it does the woodgrain ones.

65
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:04,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's that's interesting.

66
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:04,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

67
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:09,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of reply 80 bucks is still kind of pricey, but I still put kind of one.

68
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:10,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

69
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone own one of those?

70
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:13,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if they're decent or what?

71
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see going to think we have that one.

72
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:19,623
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we've had like one of the early ones before.

73
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:25,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's been at least like eight or nine probably this point flashback consoles, right, which is I think it's another developer.

74
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:36,669
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's like Atari retro, you know, they've tapped that well time and time again, but I will say some of the taps are very effective, like the Atari 50 collections pretty, pretty doggone good.

75
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:40,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always a fan of course, you know I like the arcade one-up machines.

76
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:45,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I know not every retro person is a fan because they don't like the different sizes, they don't like the modified screens.

77
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:50,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for what it is, you know what you're getting into, I think for what it is, it's a nice little modern take on that.

78
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they do a good job with the Atari retro stuff too.

79
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:57,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course that Atari thing we talked about a couple weeks ago on the show sounds pretty neat.

80
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:01,126
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually plays the old cartridges if they'll still work.

81
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:01,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be interesting.

82
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:14,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

83
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:18,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatters over there are saying Dark Tatsuya says, I've heard of that new console.

84
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,083
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says, I really want that 2600.

85
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:24,006
[SPEAKER_02]: NSG100 Matt says, huh, that's interesting.

86
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of my reaction too.

87
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:26,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea that that was a thing.

88
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:32,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just don't have a practical use for one given that I've got the systems.

89
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:32,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

90
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:40,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's the type of thing I would play for like five minutes, like most things I spend that kind of money on, unfortunately, in video gaming, and then be like, let's go.

91
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:43,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I went to heaven for five minutes.

92
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:44,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, let's go.

93
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:48,708
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be me with that Atari 2600 device, but I still kind of want it.

94
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:53,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I could do some a video review for VOG and make

95
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,482
[SPEAKER_02]: 7 cents of that $70 back.

96
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:56,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

97
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:58,364
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not even monetized on YouTube yet.

98
00:05:58,364 --> 00:06:02,387
[SPEAKER_02]: More people need to watch us over at YouTube slash VOG Network, VOG Network.

99
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:07,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of YouTube stars, say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki or LokiOLR.

100
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:08,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

101
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:10,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, how are you?

102
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:10,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.

103
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:11,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good.

104
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:12,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Question mark.

105
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:13,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you are.

106
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:15,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope things are fantastic for you.

107
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:16,237
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

108
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:17,657
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Minecraft creation world.

109
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:20,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you started your new season, right?

110
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I finally put out an episode for it.

111
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:28,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I started the season like a month ago, but you know, it doesn't really start until the rest of us can see it.

112
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:29,625
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

113
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,647
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

114
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:34,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Some first person adventure gaming going on there.

115
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that one of the Half-Life games?

116
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell what that is.

117
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:40,663
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it is a relatively new game, actually.

118
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,724
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Ion Fury.

119
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:46,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's what they had to change from Ion Maiden, huh?

120
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

121
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:53,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the one that they built in the Build 3D engine.

122
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,469
[SPEAKER_01]: So the old Duke Nukem 3D engine.

123
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,290
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it looks like Duke Nukem 3D.

124
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

125
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,991
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, nice.

126
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:01,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say it's not.

127
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recognize Duke Nukem 3D.

128
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not a level in that game.

129
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But OK, Ion Maiden got it, or Ion

130
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Storm.

131
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:08,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, what did they end up calling?

132
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I still call it Ion Maiden.

133
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's not what we're supposed to call it.

134
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,632
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

135
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

136
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:16,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Game involving ions in the title.

137
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:17,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

138
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Ion named game.

139
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:20,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into our show tonight.

140
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually at the top of the show, we would get into a kickoff topic, one of the big stories for the week.

141
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,480
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to do that in a moment.

142
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was brought to my attention that we actually passed a pretty big landmark this week that, frankly, I was unaware of.

143
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:44,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to talk a little bit about this little game that I know I used to play an awful lot of, as did DarkSakura, as did Loki.

144
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:51,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe once in a while we'll dabble in this game, and I know some of you out there still play this game an awful lot.

145
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:56,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, of course, talking about the game that brought us all together, that started Orange Lawns Radio, Dance Dance Revolution.

146
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:05,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not, DDR, as of course we've called it over the years, turned 25 this week.

147
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, DDR is 25 years old.

148
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:16,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize this because it doesn't quite feel like 25 to us because of course we didn't get it in America for a little while.

149
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:22,462
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, and, you know, nuances around when would you consider the official launch?

150
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it USA Mix?

151
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:26,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it when the first machine was imported over here?

152
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:29,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of ways you could kind of, you know, measure that.

153
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:39,091
[SPEAKER_02]: But, officially, the arcade version of DDR 1.0, you know, Aye Aye Aye, Butterfly, Paranoia, all those songs from the original DDR,

154
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:42,273
[SPEAKER_02]: September 26th, 1998.

155
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you would remember the year if you play DDR over the years, they actually had a song called 1998.

156
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,723
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, it was a reference to the year that DDR actually came out.

157
00:08:53,723 --> 00:09:01,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, believe it or not, 1998 was 25 years ago, however old that might make you feel to hear that.

158
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this game that brought us all together, because again,

159
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:16,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I tell this story once in a while, but for our new listeners that may be out there, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki all met through the community behind this game.

160
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:22,673
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a very large internet-based community before there was Twitter, before there was Facebook even.

161
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:25,415
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a very large community called DDRFreak.

162
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:36,850
[SPEAKER_02]: and myself and DarkSakura and Loki were all posters on that forum at one time or another and we all were local to Sacramento and we would all meet up.

163
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got made a mod.

164
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

165
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:39,934
[SPEAKER_02]: You were a mod at one point.

166
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a flashy foot eventually thanks to OLR because we ended up

167
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting how things came full circle.

168
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:53,022
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up with the privilege of debuting songs from Ultramix 4 here on this program years later.

169
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:59,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it may not feel like it now all these years later, but in the early years of OLR, if you go back to Episode 1, Episode 2,

170
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:05,146
[SPEAKER_02]: through about episode 108, I think it was 168, actually, was the crossover number.

171
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can find those episodes if you know where to look.

172
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:09,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember, they're dated.

173
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:14,348
[SPEAKER_02]: But all those episodes, we really talked at length about the DDR community.

174
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, you know, how do you fill three hours talking about DDR?

175
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, just like there's on this show now, there's many tangents.

176
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You would still have, you know, other types of music games.

177
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:30,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still say things in the later years, like Guitar Hero, you know, other music games that were

178
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: RedOctane

179
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:50,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting how DDR has really come full circle in a lot of ways.

180
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously I have to take a moment to acknowledge this game that started it all.

181
00:10:54,018 --> 00:11:00,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Without this game, I would not know DarkSakura, Loki, or probably any of you, quite frankly.

182
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:03,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly as well as we know each other now, thanks to Orange Lounge Radio.

183
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:08,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Orange Lounge was the name of one of the bands in later DDR.

184
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:13,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So like an ABBA tribute band might call themselves Mamma Mia,

185
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:14,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio

186
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where the show was born from of this game that now 25 years on, interestingly enough, feels like it's in a, I don't know if I would say Renaissance, or more like a second life, a second mix, if you will, truly like a DDR second mix.

187
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:47,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call it that.

188
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:52,626
[SPEAKER_02]: of what's been happening in this like round one era, right?

189
00:11:52,626 --> 00:12:04,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like, you know, when we were at our prime in DDR in the show's early days, if we wanted to play import games, that involved us really looking around for them, right?

190
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:16,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sometimes we might have to go to some of the golf lands in South Bay, had some import machines, or you might, I want to say for a short time, there was some in San Francisco, but usually it involved us driving to LA.

191
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:31,663
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to either go to Koreatown, or the Japan Center that's there in LA, or the legendary Arcade Infinity, which I'm sure many of you have heard about from its fighting game roots, that was also a huge hotbed for music games and import and all that.

192
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:34,536
[SPEAKER_03]: R.I.P.

193
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: and they also sold import cars.

194
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is fascinating.

195
00:12:52,706 --> 00:13:00,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio and DDR Freak Radio kind of started around the same time, and they were actually independent thoughts of each other.

196
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:07,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the time, I mean, I don't know how far down this road I want to go, but it's the past to me now.

197
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:10,912
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time, the moderator that started DDR Freak and I weren't speaking.

198
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:17,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we would have had no clue that we were thinking of somewhat similar ideas.

199
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:20,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously they were deviating quite a bit.

200
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, you had this interesting position where you got to walk the line of both those things.

201
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: But time passed and we came to a point where we ended up getting simulcast on DDR Freak Radio, we ended up kind of helping each other out.

202
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:40,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like they actually contributed programming to us, I want to say at one point, we did like a countdown show in cahoots with them and so forth.

203
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:41,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um,

204
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:53,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it's, you know, a lot of the collaborations we've been able to do over the years have really opened us up to more audiences, whether it's DDR Freak Radio, or, you know, through the years we were on All Games Radio, we met a lot of new faces and so forth.

205
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all been, you know, networking is a great thing.

206
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:57,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure is.

207
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:11,981
[SPEAKER_02]: DJRamaS in our chat, who I know also played DDR back in the back in the day, said it's interesting that Taku and Naoki Madeya haven't said anything about 25 years of DDR.

208
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think I think very similar.

209
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Mida.

210
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:17,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

211
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just think I know.

212
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:20,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I always think of that.

213
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:21,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

214
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:24,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always say something.

215
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:29,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did get to meet him once, and he does dress just as fashionably as you would imagine.

216
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:32,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Just putting that out there.

217
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:43,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say they're no longer employees of Konami, and I'm assuming those are not fond memories in the past, very similar to what Hideo Kojima is looking back in the memories.

218
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:45,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami knows how to burn those bridges.

219
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Konami definitely knows how to burn those bridges.

220
00:14:47,309 --> 00:15:01,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, Naoki is now doing, like, again, you want to talk about second mix, is doing spiritual successor music in Step Maniacs, which is, it's interesting because DDR and Konami machines exist.

221
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:09,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, of course, you have Step Maniacs, which also exists as another sort of evolution in a different way, just of a different mind.

222
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know,

223
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:19,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as if DDR, you know, back in the extreme days would have just kept going in the extreme way and not like in all the other weird ways that they went.

224
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:19,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

225
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:40,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really cool to see a lot of the musical spiritual successors in the Step Maniacs because, you know, they've been very good about getting licenses from the old DDR games or like more contemporary songs from the same artists or even throwback songs from the same artists like E-Rotic, you know, was, you would know that even if you

226
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:42,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Our lap giggling at the name.

227
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:54,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that was actually the name of a band in DDR because it was the name of a band that was on the Dance Maniacs CD music collection in Japan, where all the music licenses came from.

228
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more of their music.

229
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:56,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have stuff of theirs in my playlist.

230
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:57,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

231
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

232
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,030
[SPEAKER_02]: No, those dance

233
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly the ABBA covers.

234
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that is like the actually specifically the erotic Megamix album, which you could find on YouTube.

235
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:11,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you find anything on YouTube these days is actually still like a bop to listen to.

236
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,442
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's it's Euro trash.

237
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,743
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the genre I would put.

238
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:16,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It is absolute Euro trash.

239
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:17,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

240
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:21,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is also trash television.

241
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching it once in a while.

242
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what it is.

243
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's that trash music we like to listen to.

244
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:41,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I don't know where I was going with all that, but I felt we needed to kind of just tip our hat and nod to this game that turned 25 years old that really brought us together, DDR.

245
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:47,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, DarkSakura, I know I've been kind of dominating the conversation, but is there anything you want to say about DDR, DDR memories?

246
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, it was huge.

247
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it was absolutely huge in just our lives.

248
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:53,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we played

249
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,523
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a show about it.

250
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:56,644
[SPEAKER_01]: We've played it.

251
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:57,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I own it.

252
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just.

253
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:04,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's still just earlier this week, I was listening to a song on Spotify.

254
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:11,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know, that sounds like a DDR song, something that they should probably have in there, like, you know, Step Maniacs, I guess, at this point.

255
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:15,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

256
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:15,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

257
00:17:15,976 --> 00:17:18,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of our I mean, go ahead.

258
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:18,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

259
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:25,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just saying, you know, I remember getting really good balance trying not to slip on my Dreamcast, you know.

260
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:40,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a really good memory of coming home and seeing a dance pad laid out with a big Dreamcast logo on it and seeing Second Mix on my TV.

261
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And just going, oh, I have a good hubby.

262
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not hubby at the time, but I knew he was a keeper.

263
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:55,717
[SPEAKER_03]: and going to your place and bringing over the original Disney mix and third mix and fourth mix.

264
00:17:55,717 --> 00:18:02,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I had that really crappy dance pad from the Jungle Book game on PlayStation 1 that you could actually use as a DDR mat.

265
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked for both, but it was it was for a child, so it was a lot smaller.

266
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:08,943
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got the job and I lived.

267
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:09,884
[SPEAKER_02]: We were mentally there.

268
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:10,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I lived it.

269
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:15,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in an upstairs apartment at the time, which also was really funny in retrospect.

270
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:16,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

271
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:33,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I was gonna say, because Loki you were talking about, you know, just how much DDR is, you know, impacted and, and we in in some sorts of ways have impacted DDR as well, you know, like I said, we got to do some of the previews of songs here on this show, you know, and talk to some of the people and

272
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:59,607
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of our friends and well not a lot but you know relatively our friends and peers of the DDR freak era several of them worked on the games you know especially the xbox series although some of the other stuff too so it's it's interesting how the fans sort of ultimately impacted the franchise i got to play supernova in front of naoki that's that's right you were you were the first person outside konami to play ddr supernova i was there i saw it so

273
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:02,697
[SPEAKER_01]: DVR Association got us on TV playing Early Guitar Freaks at my house.

274
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:19,166
[SPEAKER_03]: and also taught me how to how to actually hold drumsticks properly.

275
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:24,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not DDR, but leading to drum mania, you know, leading up to the other games.

276
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:29,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I I learned a lot and I overcame a little bit of my fear of being in public.

277
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:41,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a small, tiny part of me that even thinks I might not be doing ballet today if it wasn't for learning how to love moving.

278
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:42,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sense?

279
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:43,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, for sure.

280
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:43,616
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.

281
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:49,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting the impact this this silly little game with its silly music has had on our lives.

282
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:59,251
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's, you know, and as I was kind of referencing, now it's interesting to see that there's a second, a true second mix generation coming up because of round one.

283
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:06,954
[SPEAKER_02]: because of, you know, now that DDR machines, especially, you know, the newer mixes and so forth are a lot easier to find, right?

284
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:13,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of big cities have round one or there's other ways, you know, Konami has kind of embraced the U.S.

285
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:20,240
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution a lot more than they did in the past, where I think they more kind of just turned an eye to it where they weren't really watching it.

286
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But

287
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,481
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot can be said about that era.

288
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:28,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, obviously DDR is it's weird to say it's a renaissance, but it's it's really is like a second coming of that era.

289
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:35,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's funny because there's these podcasts that exist to talk about DDR.

290
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:39,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guarantee you the folks doing this, those shows never heard of this show.

291
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:40,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine.

292
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:41,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course not.

293
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,620
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

294
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:55,925
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there were probably too old for them to, you know, and again, we moved on from that era at some point, you know, because unfortunately, there were a few dark years in there where Konami was look like they were just going to kill the franchise and never do another one.

295
00:20:55,925 --> 00:21:05,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's what what makes this whole like second mix and second revival of DDR coming back for its 25th anniversary.

296
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:09,370
[SPEAKER_02]: All that more sweeter, but it's just a bummer that my body's gotten slower.

297
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:31,915
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years but I still can't resist you know if I if I see one I do like I do like to get on and play maybe like trick level songs I don't think I do the absolute wild stuff anymore but I'll do no I can't yeah I was just well because I'm way out of shape I need I need to get back into it but yeah it's you have to like really go back to

298
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:46,069
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're talking old school ratings because I still can't take the new ratings and put them back into like the pre, I don't even know when they switched to like 20.

299
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:51,011
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to like extreme ratings, you know, I can't do that translation.

300
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:58,734
[SPEAKER_01]: But for for me, since I'm playing extreme, it would be like a four or five footer song on singles, not doubles.

301
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like

302
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:04,680
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to go back to like the beginning like you haven't played before.

303
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's rough.

304
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:21,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also interesting now because as much as I don't give a hoot what other people think, I'm also acutely aware that if I do play a DDR machine at round one or something like people are going to be like, what's this old ass man doing playing this game?

305
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:21,998
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's it's

306
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it does start to make you feel a little self conscious.

307
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:34,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I don't think anyone really cares about that anyway, especially the people playing it probably like, Oh, hey, I recognize them, you know, like, because yeah, DDR grandpa's up on the machine again.

308
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:41,207
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not that I but you know, I don't I don't want to go when all the people that are showing off are doing their thing.

309
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, I like to I like to find the DDR machine that's in the corner somewhere.

310
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:47,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even really like to play the new new DDR machines.

311
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to go find like a DDR Max 2 machine and play Jerry Halliwell or something.

312
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:51,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

313
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:54,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know, they're really hard to find anymore.

314
00:22:54,372 --> 00:23:03,594
[SPEAKER_01]: The oldest machine I could find around here is probably, it's a Supernova or a Supernova 2, and it's at that John's Incredible Pizza.

315
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:04,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

316
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the oldest machine I've seen.

317
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:11,836
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't live where there's Max and Max 2s and 4th Mix or anything like that.

318
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:13,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I see them when traveling.

319
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:14,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see them here locally.

320
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:20,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more traveling, because even more so, I will give less of a hoot what other people think when I'm in another city.

321
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:22,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Rico's

322
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That place has been legendary locally here for years.

323
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:37,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they finally retiring?

324
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:38,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that why they're going out of business?

325
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:40,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's a good reason.

326
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:51,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea, but I very much think it'd be worthwhile to, you know, see if they still have a machine there and to give it a send off.

327
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:51,641
[SPEAKER_02]: One last try.

328
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:57,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when the only Max2 machine in town was at a Giovanni's Pizza, the New York style pizza place?

329
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:01,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, their pizza was... That place was yummy.

330
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,769
[SPEAKER_02]: That place was bomb.

331
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:05,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they were the only place in town with a Max2 machine.

332
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonder what happened to all those machines.

333
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I'm sure a lot of individuals own them now, but like... They're in school's garages rotting away.

334
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

335
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:22,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, the Mels, our dear friends of the show here, owned the Parapara machine that used to be at Arcade Infinity all those years ago.

336
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:26,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, they end up with private collectors one way or the other.

337
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:27,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

338
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:27,936
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

339
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:28,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

340
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:31,583
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakuraNews had to build Dance Maniacs.

341
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,024
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

342
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:32,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

343
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki was building one, right?

344
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:37,721
[SPEAKER_03]: For a moment?

345
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:38,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to, yeah.

346
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:49,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought sensors and stuff, and I had a whole plan with my candy cab that I was gonna make, like, all the different Bomani machines out of it and stuff, and I had, like, parts and things I had acquired from all that.

347
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:55,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be, like, a way to, like, have DDR at home, but then when I got DDR at home, I was like, ah, yeah, I'm not gonna do that stuff anymore.

348
00:24:55,893 --> 00:25:01,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the monitor broke, so I have to fix that first on the candy cab before I do anything.

349
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,979
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Dance Maniacs is fun for a while.

350
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:08,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I actually had a Dance Maniacs machine, I'd probably get tired of it eventually.

351
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:13,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Only because they don't have a way to do Step Mania stuff in there.

352
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:20,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, I'm sure you could probably do it, make something like that, which would be really sweet.

353
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:24,874
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'd be curious to see where all those old machines are, though.

354
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:29,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm sure some private collectors have them, but I can't be all private collectors.

355
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:46,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, probably lots of in the groove machines out there, I guess, old old machines, arcades and things like that, just places you wouldn't think to bowling alleys, you know, in rural America, just, you know, where you yeah, even bowling alleys nowadays, like it's all ticket machines.

356
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:48,185
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you can go to arc.

357
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:52,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I go to arcades like I was just at arcade yesterday.

358
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:57,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always the same machines now.

359
00:25:57,948 --> 00:26:03,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised because some of the stuff I saw, they had a course like Fruit Ninja on a touch screen.

360
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:05,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, why?

361
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw Infinity Blade EX.

362
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that was a free demo.

363
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's making an arcade game out of that?

364
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:16,432
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get all of those assets for free on the Epic Games Store.

365
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:17,612
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the point?

366
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:24,767
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a thing, you know, I went to Scandia because we want to play mini golf.

367
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,468
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no DDR there.

368
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:32,030
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all ticket games and it's all ticket games.

369
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,571
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the usual games you see there.

370
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:39,973
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's like the Nerf gun game, which is kind of lame.

371
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:45,175
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just a few pinball machines, stuff like that.

372
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:49,237
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's there's not a lot of dance games out there nowadays.

373
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:54,084
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we're gonna move on with the show.

374
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:59,326
[SPEAKER_02]: We could spend three hours reminiscing on DDR, but we do want to get into this week's news and so forth.

375
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to it.

376
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:04,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about now 25 years later what the big headlines are.

377
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:06,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the big headline of the week.

378
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, why don't I kick it over to you?

379
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:10,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this really could be any year because this has happened.

380
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,332
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't the first time it's happened.

381
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,913
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like at least the second time it's happened recently.

382
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:16,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So

383
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:18,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

384
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:32,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So another hacking group has claimed that they have compromised all of Sony's systems, saying that we won't, we're not ransoming the data, we will sell the data due to Sony not wanting to pay.

385
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:35,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Data is for sale, we are selling it.

386
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:38,692
[SPEAKER_02]: According to... So they're not ransoming the data, but they're holding it...

387
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:40,819
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ransoming the data.

388
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:46,684
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean they were ransoming the data and somebody said we're not paying the ransom, so now they're selling the data.

389
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:54,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'd be like if I kidnap a child, they don't want the child back, and so now I have to sell the child to somebody else.

390
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,192
[SPEAKER_02]: What a horrible analogy, but thank you.

391
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:58,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how I've been better with a cat or a dog.

392
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:03,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd look at it more as that they have a better opportunity to make some sort of profit instead.

393
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, yeah.

394
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:20,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently, according to Australian cybersecurity publication Cybersecurity Connect, they had reported that the group has allegedly unearthed screenshots of Sony's internal login pages.

395
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:31,105
[SPEAKER_01]: They provided them an internal PowerPoint presentation outlining test bench details and several Java files, as well as a documentary of the entire leak housing 6,000 files.

396
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:36,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the proof that they built, that basically provided them.

397
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:43,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Within those 6000 files is different documentation, build logs, HTML data.

398
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:47,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure what necessarily that means as far as like games.

399
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're talking like source code or anything here.

400
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:58,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to barge in, but I have some late breaking news and I need to mention this before I drop it.

401
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:59,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody just got back from Costco.

402
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:10,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't see my webcam, I'm holding up a box with the Atari retro video game system that I spoke about earlier in the program.

403
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,661
[SPEAKER_02]: is now in my hands.

404
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:13,401
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.

405
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:26,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be we'll be doing a video or two on that pretty I did not realize now what I did not realize is that it's not just 2600 it's 5200 7800 arcade and other other crap too.

406
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty exciting.

407
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:31,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, and bonus game bonus games.

408
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:35,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the amazing Alan Alchemy for picking that up.

409
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said I'm taking it out of your mortgage check.

410
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry, Loki, but important update.

411
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:46,858
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely understandable.

412
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:51,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, Sony has told IGN that they're currently looking into the claims.

413
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:53,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We're investigating the situation.

414
00:29:53,423 --> 00:29:54,824
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no further comment.

415
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:55,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

416
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:12,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so apparently this ransomware operator and ransomware as a service organization, ransom.vc, they have, I guess they operate out of Ukraine or Russia.

417
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:25,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've also reportedly worked with EU's General Data Protection and GDPR and other data privacy laws to report vulnerabilities with companies.

418
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've

419
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:31,762
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing white hat hacking, but then they also were stealing stuff?

420
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:35,906
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make any sense.

421
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:36,846
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, cool.

422
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:43,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird leaks, because that's really what I'm here for, is I just want to know, like, what games and movies and stuff is Sony hiding from us?

423
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess that's really why not come full circle after Xbox.

424
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:53,182
[SPEAKER_02]: But now here's the problem with the Xbox stuff that happened last week.

425
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:56,803
[SPEAKER_02]: If you all were here for that, there was a lot of stuff that leaked from Microsoft.

426
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:58,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Microsoft's fault.

427
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:00,264
[SPEAKER_02]: They uploaded unredacted documents.

428
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:10,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they oops, they dragged and dropped the wrong folder into, you know, so there was really not an ethical question about if it's OK to talk about that stuff because Microsoft screwed up.

429
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:10,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

430
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:15,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks for them, but nobody stole anything in that case.

431
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:24,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in this case, it's it's not really the same thing because however you want to sugarcoat it, this stuff was stolen.

432
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:27,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's gonna get I'm like, let me tell you.

433
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:33,804
[SPEAKER_02]: go back and listen to everything I was saying about headlines on blogs and everything.

434
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:37,866
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no ethic questions that are going to be asked by those folks.

435
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:39,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not going to happen.

436
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:43,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So this news is going to leak out because people want those clicks.

437
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTubers want those views, right?

438
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:47,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's gonna happen.

439
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:53,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, you know, it's a matter of when it actually comes out.

440
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:55,455
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody doesn't buy it to suppress it, which is

441
00:31:55,866 --> 00:32:03,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if Sody knows what the data is, so if they're talking like build logs, like... Okay, cool, you have build logs.

442
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so what?

443
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:08,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we don't care.

444
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:10,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like, who needs that?

445
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:15,688
[SPEAKER_01]: It may just not be interesting, like Java files, like.

446
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:20,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about people's logins, like the great PS3 hack and all this stuff where.

447
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:30,638
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even say that they have that, though, like they just have like a screenshot of the internal login page and internal PowerPoint presentation talking about test bench details.

448
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:36,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, ooh boy, now you're gonna reveal what test benches they run to test stuff.

449
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:37,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

450
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:42,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So this may not be as much of a fire.

451
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:48,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a dumpster fire, but it's not the smoking, you know, hot stuff you want to see.

452
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:50,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Sony's not saying anything about it.

453
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the group is going to hype it up.

454
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:53,382
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to make it sound like that.

455
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:56,704
[SPEAKER_01]: They have something big because they want somebody to pay for it.

456
00:32:56,704 --> 00:32:57,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

457
00:32:57,545 --> 00:33:01,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I'm wondering if it's just it's a nothing burger.

458
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:03,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

459
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's time let it leak out.

460
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:09,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to some comments from chat because chatter is giving a lot of insight over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

461
00:33:09,794 --> 00:33:17,619
[SPEAKER_02]: SheHulk10 says they should pay to protect their customers since they don't invest in their IT and still prosecute as well.

462
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:18,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

463
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:18,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

464
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what a whole wasn't that the setup of the Mel Gibson movie?

465
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:24,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pay the ransom but then I'm going to go shoot the person.

466
00:33:24,824 --> 00:33:25,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

467
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:26,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm mixing.

468
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:27,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Liam Neeson?

469
00:33:27,746 --> 00:33:28,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

470
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:28,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

471
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:32,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, SEO 100 Matt says so last time this happened with PlayStation 3,

472
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:36,250
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave folks, what, a free game and PlayStation Plus.

473
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,931
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they giving folks now in the inevitable class action lawsuit?

474
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:45,753
[SPEAKER_02]: QuestBuster says there was also another individual that allegedly leaked the dump for free.

475
00:33:45,753 --> 00:33:51,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And for what they listed, it apparently doesn't have anything related to film or games, but it did have information.

476
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:57,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have items like information on certificates, policies, and a license generator.

477
00:33:57,196 --> 00:33:58,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bobby follows that up too.

478
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the data is probably unremarkable.

479
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:03,678
[SPEAKER_02]: They accessed the analogy to the company's Google Drive.

480
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,279
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't store customer data there.

481
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more internal documentation between teams.

482
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:15,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like it's kind of like one technical step, maybe under what we saw from the Microsoft data leak in some regards.

483
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:24,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So those certificates and the things you're talking about, that would have nothing to do about bypassing customer security and like security certificates, right?

484
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:26,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking more about like game certification process.

485
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:27,956
[SPEAKER_02]: right?

486
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:29,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to make sure I don't know.

487
00:34:29,437 --> 00:34:29,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

488
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:32,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Because those are two different things, right?

489
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:39,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they somehow make it easier to spoof and fake users, well, that could still be a big deal even without specific names and passwords and information.

490
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,161
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're talking about like game certification process and stuff.

491
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:46,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's probably gonna be more on the unremarkable license.

492
00:34:46,442 --> 00:34:54,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Generator was like for generating, you know, key pairs so that you could basically put third party like software onto a PlayStation.

493
00:34:54,767 --> 00:35:00,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that would be enormous, like even if it's not dev stuff, but I doubt it.

494
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that.

495
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:15,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I imagine more will develop on this in the coming weeks because one way or another this information is probably going to get out unless somebody unless somebody at Sony or well connected to them ends up buying it and suppressing it.

496
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:18,591
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like even when that happens, people tend to leak it out anyway.

497
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:21,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, you can't trust a crook like this.

498
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:22,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

499
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:25,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I don't know.

500
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:26,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

501
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:27,768
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

502
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:34,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have been playing this week on Sony platforms or otherwise.

503
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:35,613
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

504
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:37,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go to DarkSakura first.

505
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:41,437
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

506
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:41,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

507
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:45,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi.

508
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:45,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

509
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:46,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

510
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,580
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your game?

511
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It's working.

512
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

513
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:48,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

514
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:48,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I

515
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:52,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been having some weird lag, sorry.

516
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:52,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's okay.

517
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:54,897
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hearing a little bit of a robot effect.

518
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:56,218
[SPEAKER_03]: My week was pretty okay.

519
00:35:56,218 --> 00:36:06,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was going to beat Live Alive last night and no, I instead was trying... I must have heard you like way later.

520
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:08,307
[SPEAKER_02]: You did.

521
00:36:08,307 --> 00:36:08,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

522
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:10,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I in real time now?

523
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

524
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.

525
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:26,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so anyway, I thought I was going to beat Live Alive last night and instead what happened is I was going after everybody's best weapon and I have one more to go.

526
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:28,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And then hopefully I can beat the game.

527
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:30,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I like the game.

528
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:33,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having a good time, but I'm kind of ready to be done.

529
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Played some Disney Dreamlight Valley, played some Dead by Daylight.

530
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing the thing, Rob.

531
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:41,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on Nurse.

532
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:44,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fun.

533
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:48,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's if you practice, practice, practice, hear me cry and scream.

534
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:54,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is, I mean, I am using Plaid Flannel, so I know where I'm going.

535
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:59,217
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, I did some just, like, instinctive blinks and got people.

536
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I can get there.

537
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:06,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like something clicked and the blinking is kind of making a bit more sense.

538
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:12,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was easing myself into it by using the matchbox, which gives her 4.4 movement speed.

539
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:20,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So just sort of like normal killer speed, but faster than survivors, but with only one blink.

540
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:24,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I just, if I'm going to do it, I'm just going to, I need to learn to blink.

541
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:24,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

542
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:27,427
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

543
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:31,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's, there's that.

544
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:36,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my, I'm slowly just working my way through things.

545
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:42,390
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, I think they've expired, but if not, they're expiring tomorrow on Monday.

546
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:47,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are two blood point codes.

547
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,872
[SPEAKER_03]: One is Danka in German for thank you.

548
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:56,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other one is Kamsahamnida, which is Korean thank you.

549
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:59,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have them up on my Twitter if anyone wants to know how to spell it.

550
00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:01,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So both of those are 200 blood points a pop.

551
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:04,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to redeem those because Alan sent me the codes yesterday.

552
00:38:04,377 --> 00:38:06,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, 200,000 blood points a pop.

553
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:08,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played so little DVD lately, though.

554
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:13,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still enjoying it.

555
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:28,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually putting some work into the... Well, I haven't updated my Mac to Sonoma yet because I have to wait and see if OBS will work.

556
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the beta of OBS is going to work fine with it, but I'm still waiting a little bit.

557
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:37,437
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I want to do next is experiment with the game porting kit.

558
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:46,999
[SPEAKER_03]: and see if I can't get the emulation working through the game dev kit to actually play native.

559
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you've seen what some of these games look like... Oh my goodness.

560
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.

561
00:38:56,101 --> 00:39:03,663
[SPEAKER_03]: The videos that I linked to Loki earlier were all tested on an M1 Pro, and I just have an M1 Mac Mini.

562
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:23,880
[SPEAKER_03]: But even so, Cyberpunk looked gorgeous, Horizon Zero Dawn, they tested it with RE2, they tested it with all kinds of stuff, and they're looking really good, and I figured something as not intensive as Dead by Daylight, that's gotta be decent enough for me to test it with, so I'm gonna...

563
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:47,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up there, and I'm thinking what I might do is just do a full backup of my system, wipe everything, reinstall all my streaming tools, and, you know, my Final Cut, my Logic, and all that stuff, and see if I can try it myself, and see if I can learn to port games for friends.

564
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:52,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be fun.

565
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:52,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

566
00:39:55,653 --> 00:40:06,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a ballet and I'm actually, right now, finding the thing that I need for my new Julie cosplay at Twitter.

567
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean TwitchCon?

568
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not how you spell my name, Philof9, but thank you.

569
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:13,784
[SPEAKER_02]: TwitchCon 2021

570
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:36,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, I'm fixing up my pig cosplay.

571
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:42,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to reinforce the inside of the crown so that it actually will stay upright when I'm wearing it.

572
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:50,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and I'm also bringing the second version of the pig cosplay, which is basically me taking off that heavy-ass, you know, crown and mask and

573
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and spoil it.

574
00:40:57,425 --> 00:41:06,294
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't do the plaid Julie Legion outfit, I'm going to do the new Skabon outfit, the delinquent schoolgirl.

575
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting with the pig stuff, there's a new Saw movie that just came out with that character in it.

576
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:17,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't follow those movies super closely.

577
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,379
[SPEAKER_02]: She hasn't been in one in a while, right?

578
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:21,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they kill her off in one of them?

579
00:41:21,721 --> 00:41:25,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, spoiler alert, but not that I really care about those movies anyway.

580
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:29,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch the movies, but I've just read all the stuff about it and watched a few scenes here and there.

581
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:33,450
[SPEAKER_02]: The reviews are getting the highest score that the series has gotten since the original.

582
00:41:53,058 --> 00:42:08,543
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's fascinating to me that it's 10 movies in and it's still going you know it's something else so anyway um okay uh if that is it for your gaming week we will trot on over to Loki

583
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:12,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I just played Minecraft.

584
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:17,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my episode 1 done for season 3, which is pretty cool.

585
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:23,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've been just working on different things for the next episode and getting stuff done for that.

586
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:27,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I filmed some stuff earlier today for that and built a farm.

587
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot more farms.

588
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:34,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my starter build already designed, so I just have to gather materials and then build that.

589
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably going to be in the next episode as well.

590
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:43,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping to start ramping up and getting more episodes out sooner than, you know, a month in between.

591
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:47,636
[SPEAKER_01]: So look for that, hopefully in the next week or so.

592
00:42:47,636 --> 00:42:49,036
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

593
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:49,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

594
00:42:50,723 --> 00:42:55,547
[SPEAKER_02]: My Game of the Week, I've been playing Diablo 3, and no, that's not me misspeaking.

595
00:42:55,547 --> 00:43:05,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty done with Diablo 4's season because I finished off the Battle Pass, so I went back to check out Diablo 3 and their latest season because this is the last season with anything new.

596
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:07,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost up to level 70.

597
00:43:07,036 --> 00:43:08,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started from scratch with no help.

598
00:43:29,203 --> 00:43:34,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is, oh, I think that's the thing that lets you play offline on PC, finally.

599
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,826
[SPEAKER_02]: After all these years, PC finally has an offline mode.

600
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:42,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you play in that mode, then, yeah, you're not connected with other people or anything.

601
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:47,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no chance for you to pollute the pool, so to speak, by cheating.

602
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:49,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.

603
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:54,674
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've also been playing, I checked out Foam Stars, the beta for that.

604
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,255
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that one?

605
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:58,156
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Square Enix one that everybody's like, oh, it's Splatoon.

606
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:05,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's it's kind of Splatoon, but it's also a bit Overwatch because it's the hero stuff.

607
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:10,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you pick your particular person, and then they all have different abilities, right?

608
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:14,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, one of them fires ice cream missiles, and another one might be more like a sniper.

609
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's interesting, because it's foam, so it's not like paint,

610
00:44:19,061 --> 00:44:30,811
[SPEAKER_02]: really it you build up and you do like these you can actually build like ramps to kind of like do and instead of going under the foam like you would in Splatoon, you ride a hoverboard on top of it.

611
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can do interesting things with that.

612
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:34,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's interesting.

613
00:44:34,854 --> 00:44:36,356
[SPEAKER_02]: What I find interesting about it is that

614
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:41,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a PlayStation 5 graphic level game.

615
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:48,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more what we would have honestly like PlayStation 3 or 4, but it looks it looks nice.

616
00:44:48,058 --> 00:44:53,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And the music is is very different since it's not like ska type of music like you hear in Splatoon.

617
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like, you know, J-pop type of stuff, which is interesting.

618
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:58,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

619
00:44:58,022 --> 00:45:02,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if the game is free when it comes out, I'll check it out again.

620
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:05,365
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're going to charge 70 bucks to play it, I'm not interested.

621
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:06,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's not that's too much money.

622
00:45:08,328 --> 00:45:09,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's cute enough.

623
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:30,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play Overwatch with you, but my one stipulation is that I'm going to roll into a game as Widowmaker and I don't want to hear it.

624
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:38,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Because usually there's a lot of negative stuff that comes with people playing Widowmaker, but I'm like, no, legit, I'm trying to get better at sniping and I'm not, I'm not bad at it.

625
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:40,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know how to play Widow to like keep moving.

626
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:47,644
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to stay in one spot and, you know, use her venom trap to, you know, alert you to when a Sombra is trying to get you and things like that.

627
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:51,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's been, it's been fun to dip into Overwatch a little bit.

628
00:45:51,546 --> 00:45:54,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play a lot of it, but just, you know, a couple matches here and there.

629
00:45:54,868 --> 00:46:16,065
[SPEAKER_02]: um otherwise that's about it uh haven't been playing a lot of FFSE 14 which is not good because i think the new patch is out on Tuesday which means shucks i think there's a holiday event like i have to finish i haven't done yet i guess i need to do that tonight or tomorrow so uh i gotta get on that that game's keeping my subscription active active sometime somehow so

630
00:46:17,622 --> 00:46:18,622
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

631
00:46:18,622 --> 00:46:19,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see.

632
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:21,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Defton chat says, Rob, we should play together sometime.

633
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:22,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about Overwatch?

634
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:26,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You must be talking about Overwatch, not Foam Stars, because Foam Stars beta is going to be done after tonight.

635
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:27,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only for the weekend.

636
00:46:27,725 --> 00:46:30,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming you're talking about Overwatch because I know you play that.

637
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:33,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I can play sometime.

638
00:46:33,147 --> 00:46:34,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to stream it.

639
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:36,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I've streamed Overwatch before.

640
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:41,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stream it again and have like open lobbies or whatever you want to call it where we can team up and play.

641
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:42,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

642
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,030
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my gaming week.

643
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching my friend play last night.

644
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:46,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's

645
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a fun little time waster.

646
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't play it.

647
00:46:51,303 --> 00:46:52,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't play it.

648
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:53,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It still makes me sick.

649
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:55,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hear it.

650
00:46:55,327 --> 00:47:02,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be very fast moving, which, yeah, if you, you know, have the first person stuff can get a little, yeah.

651
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:02,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

652
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:07,979
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's get some headlines out of the way here.

653
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:12,341
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a bit going on in the gaming world this week, so I'm going to punt it over to Loki.

654
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me say, though, quickly, as I did mention TwitchCon earlier, that does mean we will not be here live the night of October 22nd as DarkSakura, myself, and as it turns out, Bobby Blackwolf from the show that's on before us on Sunday nights, are all going to be at TwitchCon.

655
00:47:28,268 --> 00:47:29,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby is working with the

656
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:39,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Games Done Quick Express, I hope I called it the right name, but they're doing basically a smaller satellite version of Games Done Quick at TwitchCon.

657
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:46,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to be one of the announcers for that as he has done some of the announcing for the larger events, awesome games and all that stuff.

658
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool to see that.

659
00:47:48,522 --> 00:47:53,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will let you, I will defer to his show for all the details on that.

660
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:54,386
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get to headlines.

661
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:54,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

662
00:47:55,788 --> 00:48:13,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so remember we talked a little bit about Sackgraftra and how, you know, they were doing the strike against the different movie studios and stuff, and one of the things that they were able to do, the members at least, were to still participate in video games, doing voice acting and motion capture and that type of stuff right now.

663
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:13,802
[SPEAKER_01]: However...

664
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:21,026
[SPEAKER_01]: how times have not changed, but how things have progressed over that short period of time.

665
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:29,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, SAG-AFTRA members have actually approved a video game strike authorization vote with 98.32% yes.

666
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:38,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, that doesn't mean that they're necessarily striking yet, but that they're, you know, looking to negotiate better deals and that may lead to a strike.

667
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:40,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Here pretty soon.

668
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:53,377
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the head of, the president of SAG-AFTRA, Fran Drescher, says, it is time, it's time for video game companies to stop playing games and get serious about reaching an agreement on this contract.

669
00:48:53,377 --> 00:49:06,864
[SPEAKER_01]: The result of this vote shows our membership understands the existential nature of these negotiations and that the time is now for these companies, which are making billions of dollars and paying their CEOs lavishly,

670
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:14,147
[SPEAKER_01]: to give our performers an agreement that keeps performing in video games as a viable career.

671
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:23,531
[SPEAKER_01]: After five rounds of bargaining, it has become abundantly clear that the video game companies aren't willing to meaningfully engage on critical issues.

672
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:31,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Compensation undercut by inflation, unregulated use of AI and safety, AI especially in the video game space,

673
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:40,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I remain hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement that meets the members' needs, but our members are done being exploited.

674
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:46,613
[SPEAKER_01]: If these corporations are willing to offer a fair deal, our next stop will be the picket lines.

675
00:49:48,313 --> 00:49:51,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say I'm not surprised things are going this route.

676
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:58,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it like but obviously, you know, a lot of big game companies are kind of tied to movie studios as well.

677
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:08,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Sony, look at Warner Brothers, you know, with like Mortal Kombat and stuff like a lot of movie studios also have game companies or close relationships with it.

678
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:11,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not entirely surprising.

679
00:50:11,544 --> 00:50:14,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, obviously, I would like the studios to

680
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean...

681
00:50:41,726 --> 00:50:43,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's it's that's what it takes.

682
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:48,591
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's what it takes to get the studios to make an agreement, then so be it.

683
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:52,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to have some games get delayed as a result.

684
00:50:52,314 --> 00:50:53,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.

685
00:50:53,695 --> 00:50:57,897
[SPEAKER_01]: The Writers Guild was able to finally get what they were looking for.

686
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:01,160
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the late breaking news right at the end of our show last week, wasn't it?

687
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

688
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,021
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's excellent.

689
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:06,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, we're expecting, I think, the Screen Actors Guild to kind of

690
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:30,346
[SPEAKER_01]: probably pretty closely follow them so maybe we'll hear something even this week about that but if it's you know they're able to negotiate better deals with the movie studios and tv studios and that type of stuff then you know i think that they should be able to negotiate better deals with video games why why should video games be like so special in that sense like if anything

691
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:43,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if anything, I think for sure, especially when we're talking about protections against like AI and stuff, the video game space has been more prolific with trying to go that route, like saying, Oh, yeah, that's fine.

692
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:47,312
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'll just pay you for your voice and then we'll use your voice forever.

693
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what, what the hell, man?

694
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,234
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not Ursula.

695
00:51:50,234 --> 00:51:52,736
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just take someone's voice and use it however you want.

696
00:51:52,736 --> 00:51:55,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is the video game industry.

697
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:56,779
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to treat people like people.

698
00:51:59,941 --> 00:52:02,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that analogy.

699
00:52:02,404 --> 00:52:15,178
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that's a little worrisome about the video game thing is that it might be very tempting for some individuals, because I know there's a lot of people out there that want to break into voice acting and video games, and it's going to be very tempting for some people to want to cross the picket lines to do

700
00:52:16,919 --> 00:52:17,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a role or something.

701
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure there will be companies that will look to try to fill some of their needs with folks that are aspiring and what have you.

702
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:31,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big warning to you, do not cross picket lines to work with the big studios anyway.

703
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:36,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will be important because there will still be indie game makers, not a part of this.

704
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:36,896
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar.

705
00:52:36,896 --> 00:52:38,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what's going on the movie side.

706
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:41,459
[SPEAKER_02]: There are movies being made that are like exceptions, basically.

707
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:44,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still going to be indie studios that are not a part of this.

708
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:47,923
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, you continue to work with them, let them grow.

709
00:52:47,923 --> 00:52:49,585
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones we need to help flourish.

710
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:49,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

711
00:52:49,825 --> 00:52:51,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that, you know, help help to grow.

712
00:52:51,946 --> 00:53:00,632
[SPEAKER_02]: But be very careful about that type of stuff, because, again, if you, you know, cross the line, you're you're never going to get into SAG-AFTRA and the nanny will see to that.

713
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:02,514
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

714
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:03,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking in chat.

715
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:11,379
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt says, uh, Fran Drescher talking about video games wasn't on my bingo card.

716
00:53:11,379 --> 00:53:14,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, but you know what?

717
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:20,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the nanny has probably played a game of Candy Crush in her life, even if that statement was very obviously written for her, but that's okay.

718
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:27,527
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a very busy person and, you know, doing her thing, uh, you know, running SAG-AFTRA and representing in the media and all that stuff.

719
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:29,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.

720
00:53:30,428 --> 00:53:34,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, PodCulture in chat says cross in order to just feed their fam.

721
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:41,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really what I'm talking about because these would be people that are looking to get their break, uh, through this whole thing.

722
00:53:41,232 --> 00:53:44,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, yeah, that would not be acceptable.

723
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:54,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, usually in the cases of these big strikes, they have funds set up to help people that are striking because, you know, when we talk about actors and actresses striking, we're not talking about

724
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:58,119
[SPEAKER_02]: TomCruises and JLo's, just that, right?

725
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:05,443
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about people that often do get featured in backgrounds or get paid a hell of a lot less than you probably otherwise assume.

726
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:14,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what some of these people, like, you look at what people make on the convention circuit and you go, so-and-so charges $60 for an autograph or $80 for an autograph.

727
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:14,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

728
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:25,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Look into how much they made for doing the show because I'll guarantee you it was probably something where you were like, whoa, I expected they made millions of dollars from this.

729
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:26,661
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably made like $5,000 an episode.

730
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: if that, if that.

731
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:32,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, something to consider.

732
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have funds set up to help people that are struggling due to the strike and things like that.

733
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:38,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

734
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:44,904
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, actually, because of all that, there was like some big actors actually donated quite a bit of money to those strike funds as well.

735
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:47,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of solidarity going around.

736
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:48,367
[SPEAKER_02]: There definitely is.

737
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:48,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

738
00:54:49,387 --> 00:55:17,138
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody should should have to cross to do that if anybody felt like they needed to I'm sure they could get in touch with one of these funds and and figure out their options such as you know there's also again indie companies and smaller studios you know if this does go through it's only going to be the major studios that are impacted I'm not sure if that would necessarily include like EA and Ubisoft I didn't read into it or if it's just the ones that are tied to movie studios but even if it did impact the the AAA players like it did last time there's still going to be plenty of

739
00:55:18,178 --> 00:55:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that are indie and not a part of this.

740
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,600
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

741
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some updates going on in the MetaQuest side of things.

742
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:41,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So as it is today, MetaQuest will allow you to stream Xbox games to the MetaQuest, or the Oculus if you will, and actually let you play video games in it.

743
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:47,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But now what's happening is that the MetaQuest 3 is going to get official support for Xbox

744
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:49,371
[SPEAKER_02]: CloudGaming.

745
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:55,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to be fair, this was already announced at last year's MetaConnect, is what they call that.

746
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:02,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this year's event, Mark Zuckerberg, who is the CEO of Facebook, they say meta, but it's just...

747
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:05,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate all these new tech company names.

748
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:08,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not calling it X. I'm not calling it Meta, even if I did.

749
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:12,614
[SPEAKER_02]: At least Meta is a better name than X. Like, you know, I'll give it that.

750
00:56:12,614 --> 00:56:13,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it that.

751
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:16,716
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the names continue to somehow progressively get worse.

752
00:56:16,716 --> 00:56:20,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, now we know when this is going to happen and what it's going to look like.

753
00:56:20,717 --> 00:56:26,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to happen at some point in December, and you'll be able to stream games from the cloud to the headset.

754
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:28,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason why this is such a big deal is because now

755
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,982
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically takes the Xbox out of the equation, right?

756
00:56:31,982 --> 00:56:34,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, if you will, the gaming console.

757
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:48,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, remember, the big thing about, you know, where MetaQuest are now, and the advantage, I guess, that it has over the PlayStation or PSVR 2, if you will, or some of the other VR competitors, that it doesn't hook up, and you can just put the headset device on your head, and that's it.

758
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:50,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the VR thing.

759
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:54,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is literally going to allow you to have the power of an Xbox in the headset.

760
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:56,442
[SPEAKER_02]: through the cloud.

761
00:56:56,442 --> 00:56:57,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be pretty cool.

762
00:56:57,463 --> 00:57:03,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, you'll be able to play things that are offered in Xbox Cloud Gaming, Forza Horizon, Halo Infinite, Starfield.

763
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:08,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it doesn't make all those games suddenly VR.

764
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:12,992
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is, is that it's a large 2D virtual screen that you're playing on.

765
00:57:12,992 --> 00:57:17,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So think like some of those apps that let you watch a movie on a fake screen, things like that.

766
00:57:17,574 --> 00:57:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's going to be.

767
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I didn't watch the full presentation for this but I think that this allows you to do kind of that whole AR virtual screen thing like the Apple

768
00:57:31,524 --> 00:57:52,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see how AR was involved either but again it's not gonna I think the bigger point is that it's not gonna suddenly make the games VR because they weren't programmed to be that way yeah maybe your environments that you're playing in you can kind of change up and things like that but yeah you'll be able to play the games on a 2d screen but still

769
00:57:53,064 --> 00:57:57,549
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you have, of course, Game Pass Ultimate, because that's what you need to get Xbox Cloud Gaming.

770
00:57:57,549 --> 00:58:01,513
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is still putting the power of the Xbox in a device that can attach to your head.

771
00:58:01,513 --> 00:58:05,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, and someday, you know, we're getting closer and closer.

772
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:13,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday, those devices are going to have 5G internet when that populates more and more that you could be anywhere.

773
00:58:14,364 --> 00:58:17,065
[SPEAKER_02]: with one of those things on your head play in those games.

774
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:19,887
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be very interesting when we get to that point.

775
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:26,250
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could already see a use case for this now is that like, let's say, let's say Loki is playing Starfield on the TV.

776
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making up a scenario.

777
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not really playing Starfield.

778
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna say Loki's playing Starfield on the TV.

779
00:58:30,752 --> 00:58:35,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mrs. Loki comes in and says Grey's Anatomy's on, I want the TV.

780
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:39,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki can now take his game and put it on the headset and play right there.

781
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:42,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mrs. Loki can continue to watch Grey's Anatomy

782
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:46,913
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy in 3D in VR.

783
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:48,835
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be right there.

784
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:56,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your solution is to give Mrs. Loki the headset and say, you want to watch Grey's Anatomy on the headset.

785
00:58:56,204 --> 00:58:57,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be right there in the drama.

786
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:01,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Mercy in the drama.

787
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:03,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

788
00:59:03,057 --> 00:59:05,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so that's, you know, that's gonna be pretty cool.

789
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:11,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, of course, you know, it goes without saying, Activision Blizzard and that deal looks like it's gonna be a thing.

790
00:59:11,463 --> 00:59:19,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a matter of time before we're talking Overwatch 2, Call of Duty, also potentially in the MetaQuest 3.

791
00:59:19,149 --> 00:59:21,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So interesting how that's all shaping up.

792
00:59:21,251 --> 00:59:28,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about how ridiculous the whole their AI avatar, like,

793
00:59:29,002 --> 00:59:29,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

794
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:51,047
[SPEAKER_01]: They have Snoop Dogg as a DM for like a Dungeons & Dragons type roleplaying thing.

795
00:59:51,047 --> 01:00:01,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know when I think of Dungeons & Dragons, Snoop Dogg is certainly the first person that comes to mind when it's like, it's like you couldn't have gotten anybody like else for that.

796
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:05,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I would have stuck with Baldur's Gate 3 if it was Snoop Dogg.

797
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:08,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it just looks, it looks so ridiculous.

798
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:11,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, is that, like, an AI-generated image?

799
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:21,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not really, like, is it like, haha, it's funny, because I can have Snoop Dogg as my, you know, RPG, uh, you know, DM or whatever, and like, well, I can really do anybody.

800
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,943
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that's who we chose as the RPG guy is Snoop Dogg.

801
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:29,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what?

802
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:30,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

803
01:00:30,645 --> 01:00:31,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you do that?

804
01:00:31,906 --> 01:00:33,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you could,

805
01:00:34,376 --> 01:00:37,099
[SPEAKER_01]: You could talk to him about music.

806
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:39,622
[SPEAKER_01]: You could talk to him about like drugs.

807
01:00:39,622 --> 01:00:45,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, I just don't see him as D&D guy unless there's a part of him that I really am not familiar with.

808
01:00:46,061 --> 01:00:53,025
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing you could do to show that you hate this shit is not use them.

809
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:54,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use them as a joke.

810
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:57,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use them for the lulz.

811
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:58,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?

812
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:03,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook puts a lot of this stuff people didn't ask for or sometimes even did ask for.

813
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:07,794
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, remember when we used to be able to play games like Pac-Man inside messaging app?

814
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:09,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they took it away because nobody was using it.

815
01:01:09,995 --> 01:01:18,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to show your distaste for AI, resist any temptation to just get the tee-hees off of Snoop Dogg being your DM.

816
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:21,070
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other ways you can support Snoop Dogg.

817
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,213
[SPEAKER_02]: He has his own line of wine.

818
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:25,997
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an excellent way for you to support Snoop Dogg.

819
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:26,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this.

820
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:27,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this.

821
01:01:49,057 --> 01:01:50,618
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the guy from Dungeons and Drag Queens.

822
01:01:50,618 --> 01:02:00,904
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the guy that does Dimension 20 and he is just a fantastic... Like, I cannot... I don't want to get on a tangent about talking about Dropout TV, but I fucking love that.

823
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:04,546
[SPEAKER_01]: That entire, like, network is just great.

824
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, honestly, like, I really like it.

825
01:02:07,107 --> 01:02:12,490
[SPEAKER_01]: It's independent artists doing independent things, separate from all these other, you know, big companies.

826
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,451
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good produced, you know,

827
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:15,684
[SPEAKER_01]: content.

828
01:02:15,684 --> 01:02:17,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat it all up.

829
01:02:17,205 --> 01:02:19,967
[SPEAKER_01]: But like Brendan Lee Mulligan, seriously, I watch any... I can't hate on that.

830
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hate on AI trying to reproduce.

831
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:23,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

832
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:27,311
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no, then you would never be able to recreate Brendan Lee Mulligan.

833
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:31,033
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, second season of Dungeons and Drag Queens coming sometime.

834
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:31,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the same roster?

835
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they gonna mix up the drag queens?

836
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:34,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

837
01:02:34,275 --> 01:02:35,556
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a season two.

838
01:02:35,556 --> 01:02:35,956
[SPEAKER_01]: So that

839
01:02:36,948 --> 01:02:39,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to something you can do on your phones besides Facebook.

840
01:02:59,037 --> 01:03:08,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I mean, there's plenty of things that you can do on your phone besides Facebook, but you can also play Resident Evil 4 Remake on iPhone 15.

841
01:03:08,928 --> 01:03:15,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It is available to be ordered on the App Store.

842
01:03:15,034 --> 01:03:17,516
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be released, quote, for free.

843
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:22,760
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so you can play through the first mission before you have to pay full price.

844
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is that full price?

845
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,743
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 bucks!

846
01:03:26,743 --> 01:03:33,427
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also purchase weapon upgrade tickets, the ones that are available in the current versions of the game.

847
01:03:33,427 --> 01:03:47,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you are buying a full-on game to be played on your tiny handheld computer for what the game normally costs anyway for a full version of the game.

848
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:56,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people might balk at that because they think, oh, my cell phone, it's this, you know, it's not going to play real games.

849
01:03:56,615 --> 01:03:59,516
[SPEAKER_03]: No, your your phone is a computer.

850
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:07,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a small screen, yes, but it is a full game running on a computer with a dedicated programmed version for it.

851
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So 60 bucks.

852
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Not surprised.

853
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:16,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely understand why people are getting their knickers in a twist over this because we've kind of been conditioned.

854
01:04:16,742 --> 01:04:23,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even when the Final Fantasy Pixel remaster was like $20 on cell phone, a lot of people balked at that.

855
01:04:23,664 --> 01:04:28,066
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually, I may surprise you and actually go, yeah, I get it.

856
01:04:28,066 --> 01:04:34,008
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going to charge $60 for Resident Evil on iOS, here's the thing that's really changing my mind on this whole thing.

857
01:04:35,294 --> 01:04:42,218
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on the Nintendo Switch and how they're charging $70 for that.

858
01:04:42,218 --> 01:04:56,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is the iPhone 15 and the Google equivalent, to be fair, I don't want to be accused of playing favorites, that those, those little computers, as DarkSakura put it, in your hand are probably more powerful than a Nintendo Switch.

859
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to justify paying... Probably?

860
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:00,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

861
01:05:00,008 --> 01:05:00,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

862
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:01,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

863
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:02,789
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to justify paying 60 or 70 bucks

864
01:05:04,623 --> 01:05:17,894
[SPEAKER_02]: for Mortal Kombat 1 on your Switch, then it's not outside the realm of possibility to ask to pay that on your iPhone, your Android, whatever.

865
01:05:17,894 --> 01:05:18,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially now.

866
01:05:18,595 --> 01:05:28,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I would usually balk at that because I would say, I'm not playing a f-ing touchscreen version of the game, but we all know you can hook up Bluetooth devices now and you know, da-da-da-da.

867
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:32,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You could play legit, you know, just like you're playing it on a Switch or whatever it is.

868
01:05:32,827 --> 01:05:38,413
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's steps though, like I mean, like they don't sell the switch without controllers.

869
01:05:38,413 --> 01:05:44,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm as far as the price of the game, like that's to talk about the ecosystem, talk about the price of the game.

870
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get it.

871
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, here's the thing.

872
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:46,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

873
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:49,786
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, it is very, very, very, very easy to not buy it.

874
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:58,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the reality of the $60 and $70 price tag is, like, this is a whole greater conversation.

875
01:05:58,517 --> 01:06:05,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about iPhone, I'm just talking about the sticker shock of these prices of games on any platform you're playing it on.

876
01:06:05,101 --> 01:06:08,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know a lot of people... Oh, go ahead.

877
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:12,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I just wanted to add in the point too that you can airplay this to a TV.

878
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fair point.

879
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair point.

880
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:18,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can use a normal controller with it.

881
01:06:18,362 --> 01:06:27,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and it's, it's not really, I think, as big of a deal as people thinking it is.

882
01:06:27,245 --> 01:06:34,887
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually take something much more useful than a Steam Deck.

883
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:39,760
[SPEAKER_03]: and play the game wherever you freaking want.

884
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,483
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use your cellular to play.

885
01:06:41,483 --> 01:06:43,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I wouldn't recommend it, but you could.

886
01:06:43,105 --> 01:06:44,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

887
01:06:44,608 --> 01:06:50,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you there you're honestly it's almost like you're getting a better value.

888
01:06:51,816 --> 01:06:57,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But well, speaking of that value, there's a lot of people that don't want to pay 60, 70 bucks for any game.

889
01:06:57,158 --> 01:07:00,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and what I find is happening to be them.

890
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:05,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what I find is happening is that people are playing a little bit of video game chicken.

891
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:08,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually think we kind of all do it in one way or another.

892
01:07:08,322 --> 01:07:09,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say in one way, I'm doing it.

893
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:13,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll speak right up and say, Mortal Kombat one is an excellent example.

894
01:07:13,964 --> 01:07:16,866
[SPEAKER_02]: No way in hell am I paying $70 for that game?

895
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know

896
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:19,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a waiting game.

897
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:28,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And six months down the line, the Game of the Year edition that includes all of the DLC and all this other stuff will either also be $70 or probably price cut.

898
01:07:28,673 --> 01:07:34,056
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I bet Mortal Kombat 1, as it is, price cut on Black Friday down to $45.

899
01:07:35,737 --> 01:07:39,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question becomes, how bad do you want it?

900
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:46,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might you might say, Rob, if you wait for all your games to go on sale, you're not really supporting the industry or any of that stuff.

901
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:47,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

902
01:07:47,486 --> 01:07:49,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say I do this with every game.

903
01:07:49,707 --> 01:07:55,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all pick and choose our battles with how much are we willing to pay for the game.

904
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:57,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing happens in the other arts too.

905
01:07:57,913 --> 01:07:58,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Movies.

906
01:07:58,814 --> 01:08:01,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to pay to go see it on the big screen?

907
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:03,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you going to wait for it to hit Disney Plus?

908
01:08:04,518 --> 01:08:09,202
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people do this battle in a lot of different mediums and different ways.

909
01:08:09,202 --> 01:08:15,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, yeah, I'm going to wait for Mortal Kombat 1 to go on a discount because I just, I don't need it right away.

910
01:08:15,188 --> 01:08:18,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I know y'all are saying it's a great game and yeah, okay, okay.

911
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:21,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you, but I'm perfectly content being on the sidelines until later.

912
01:08:21,953 --> 01:08:22,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.

913
01:08:23,262 --> 01:08:26,685
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about Final Fantasy 16.

914
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about Diablo 4.

915
01:08:29,527 --> 01:08:35,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Now those are the games where I go, oh, we're buying the tickets to see it in IMAX.

916
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:41,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm buying the family pass to get the front row and a large popcorn because I'm a fan.

917
01:08:41,056 --> 01:08:43,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Front row IMAX you.

918
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:44,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I'm getting at, right?

919
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:48,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for the premium seats to go see this.

920
01:08:49,242 --> 01:08:51,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So premium seats, concerts, right?

921
01:08:51,184 --> 01:08:53,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Another another thing that people paid in price for.

922
01:08:53,365 --> 01:09:04,714
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, my point is, the premium being asked for here on iOS, Android, however you slice it, is no different from what it is on other gaming platforms.

923
01:09:04,714 --> 01:09:12,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for that reason, I actually I find this whole thing a little bit sensationalist and also but but but on one hand,

924
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:21,542
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see it a lot, so I get it, but I think it's just a barometer of where the industry is going.

925
01:09:21,542 --> 01:09:22,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that.

926
01:09:23,877 --> 01:09:30,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to chat because I'm sure some of you were going to light up and chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

927
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:31,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

928
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:37,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaskrand in chat says my biggest worry with iOS game purchases is support for future versions of iOS.

929
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:42,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to spend $60 on a game that I don't know will run on iOS 20 plus?

930
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:47,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be fair, how are those PlayStation 3 games working out on your PlayStation 5?

931
01:09:48,277 --> 01:09:56,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I get your point, but it isn't totally different in other worlds either.

932
01:09:56,481 --> 01:10:03,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see, uh, BondSub06 says, I have a collection of film stubs here going back as far as 2001.

933
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:06,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaskren says, compare it to buying Doom Remake on Windows.

934
01:10:06,005 --> 01:10:11,047
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an expectation that I'll be able to play it well into the future on future versions of Windows.

935
01:10:11,047 --> 01:10:17,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and cloud gaming could make for a very interesting conversation on all of this in the future, to be quite honest.

936
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:20,953
[SPEAKER_02]: to be continued, I suppose, on that.

937
01:10:20,953 --> 01:10:23,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and here's also the thing.

938
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:26,677
[SPEAKER_03]: With iOS games, they are technically cloud-based.

939
01:10:26,677 --> 01:10:45,573
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I, say I paid 60 bucks for this game, it's now tied on my Apple ID, and my phone gets run over by a semi, and the, you know, running over by a semi insurance pays for my new phone, all I have to do is sign back in, restore my backup, the game will start re-downloading.

940
01:10:46,712 --> 01:10:50,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with just about any device these days.

941
01:10:50,254 --> 01:11:03,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So unlike if your cartridge gets broken or something is delisted, it's actually tied to the account that follows you everywhere.

942
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,563
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get a new phone, you can install it on the new phone.

943
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:10,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will also add in that M1 Macs

944
01:11:11,906 --> 01:11:18,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Silicon series will run a lot of iOS software.

945
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:20,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So in reality, you may be getting it for two devices.

946
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:27,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I want to read this comment in chat too, because this one really got me thinking, and I love when the chat comments get me thinking.

947
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:32,910
[SPEAKER_02]: SheHulk10 in chat says, A great game has no price limit for me.

948
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:38,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Some free games on Game Pass, I feel the need to pay companies for their excellence.

949
01:11:38,012 --> 01:11:39,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think of a couple scenarios here.

950
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:47,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of, I'm not going to call her out, but maybe a little bit, DarkSakura's impressive collection of cosmetics on Dead by Daylight.

951
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:52,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got to keep all those, so I was happy.

952
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:57,089
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a game that's brought you literal hundreds.

953
01:11:57,089 --> 01:11:58,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you up to a thousand hours?

954
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you're up to a thousand hours.

955
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:01,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I can check.

956
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:08,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I was already there on Stadia, so my Steam would, I don't know.

957
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:13,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you were talking about two years of Stadia play and then whatever I've done on Steam.

958
01:12:13,881 --> 01:12:17,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But and then and then here you go, DarkSakura, I teased you.

959
01:12:17,063 --> 01:12:23,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you one another example of this where SheHulk is talking about, you know, sometimes you feel the need to pay companies to the excellence.

960
01:12:24,828 --> 01:12:28,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anybody that's ever bought the same game on multiple consoles.

961
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:29,434
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

962
01:12:29,434 --> 01:12:36,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Who on earth would have bought Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U just to say they bought Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U?

963
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:37,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would have done that?

964
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:44,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got several different iterations of Link to the Past.

965
01:12:44,475 --> 01:12:48,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Breath of the Wild on Wii U and Wii.

966
01:12:48,837 --> 01:12:53,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari cartridges that are probably sitting in their garage.

967
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Who on earth would buy new versions of Atari cartridges that are probably sitting in their garage?

968
01:12:58,443 --> 01:13:00,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't be me.

969
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:01,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that too.

970
01:13:05,332 --> 01:13:10,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have Ikaruga, like Orange Rice said, how many copies of Ikaruga?

971
01:13:11,043 --> 01:13:13,866
[SPEAKER_03]: How many versions of Final Fantasy fucking six?

972
01:13:13,866 --> 01:13:15,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a brilliant point.

973
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:16,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this.

974
01:13:16,248 --> 01:13:19,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the chat is the chat is unloading, unloading.

975
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:22,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonds 006 says Pokemon remakes.

976
01:13:22,353 --> 01:13:24,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, could be me.

977
01:13:24,074 --> 01:13:26,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, let's talk about a friend of ours.

978
01:13:26,376 --> 01:13:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And just when when a Pokemon game comes out.

979
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:29,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

980
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:34,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And literally the Pokemon model is to entice you to buy what is essentially the same game twice.

981
01:13:34,964 --> 01:13:35,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be real.

982
01:13:36,265 --> 01:13:38,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a whole other thing.

983
01:13:38,068 --> 01:13:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

984
01:13:39,129 --> 01:13:51,306
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture in chat says, same kind of person who bought the movies Serenity in all available formats, VHS, HD, DVD, and PSP, UMD.

985
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:53,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.

986
01:13:53,528 --> 01:13:54,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Impressive.

987
01:13:54,048 --> 01:14:00,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how about my collection of Transformers the movie copies, which I have the Japanese Laserdisc.

988
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:03,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I have multiple DVD Blu-ray versions.

989
01:14:03,352 --> 01:14:10,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a video CD of the Japanese version of it that was the only one I could get before I got my Laserdisc.

990
01:14:10,856 --> 01:14:13,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I think we've made our point.

991
01:14:13,197 --> 01:14:18,500
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to put a price tag on how far you're willing to take your fandoms.

992
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:25,887
[SPEAKER_03]: To paraphrase, by the way, one of our favorite animated things, I'm a consumer whore!

993
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:26,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And how!

994
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:28,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And how!

995
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:34,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I like things, the end, bye.

996
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:36,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

997
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:39,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, I forgot my Gatchaman collection of stuff.

998
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:44,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, unfortunately, we're having a laugh at capitalism's, you know, about all that.

999
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:49,133
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, now we get to the dark side of capitalism with this next story.

1000
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:53,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So Loki, please take it away with another very big headline from this week.

1001
01:14:53,936 --> 01:14:56,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So Epic Games has cut their workforce by 870 jobs, or 16%.

1002
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:58,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, they said for, you know,

1003
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:08,023
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn.

1004
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:09,504
[SPEAKER_01]: This is coming from Tim Sweeney.

1005
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:15,226
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I've been long optimistic or long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs.

1006
01:15:15,226 --> 01:15:19,267
[SPEAKER_01]: But in retrospect, I see that this was unrealistic.

1007
01:15:19,267 --> 01:15:22,828
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice way of saying, you know, thanks for your help.

1008
01:15:22,828 --> 01:15:26,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I refuse to take a pay cut for my employees.

1009
01:15:26,489 --> 01:15:32,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Laid off employees will receive six months severance and health benefits.

1010
01:15:32,391 --> 01:15:32,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.

1011
01:15:33,757 --> 01:15:35,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sucks.

1012
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:45,561
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is not like this is a very common thing, unfortunately.

1013
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:47,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much of a pay cut is Tim Sweeney taking?

1014
01:15:48,967 --> 01:16:05,329
[SPEAKER_02]: because certainly, certainly if we're talking about that we have acquisitions that didn't go the way as intended, if we're talking about that the market has pivoted towards this, you know, community based games, which I actually think is a good thing, like, that's pretty cool that you know, they have the whole community program.

1015
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:32,909
[SPEAKER_02]: and that but if if the market is pivoting that way which in turn has them making less money um surely surely uh an executive or a ceo or somebody that's paid to not do anything with the games but to do the business surely the business folks are are are setting things up to you have a little bit bad um are also going to be partaking in some of these cutbacks correct

1016
01:16:33,753 --> 01:16:36,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure, of course.

1017
01:16:36,154 --> 01:16:43,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with the layoffs, they were also going to be selling Bandcamp, which I forgot that they even owned.

1018
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:49,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And spinning off, they said most of the marketing company is super awesome.

1019
01:16:49,197 --> 01:16:54,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was super awesome that they, you know, laid all those people off.

1020
01:16:54,638 --> 01:16:57,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And going to the chat, love this comment.

1021
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:02,540
[SPEAKER_02]: SSG0100 Matt says taps the sign of Iwata took a pay cut to keep his staff.

1022
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:02,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.

1023
01:17:03,672 --> 01:17:04,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.

1024
01:17:04,172 --> 01:17:05,393
[SPEAKER_02]: That part.

1025
01:17:05,393 --> 01:17:12,256
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this is why when we talk about Iwata and his legacy, we say nice things.

1026
01:17:12,256 --> 01:17:13,456
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part.

1027
01:17:13,456 --> 01:17:15,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, nobody's nobody's perfect.

1028
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,658
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, we say nice things.

1029
01:17:17,658 --> 01:17:25,541
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about Tim Sweeney, and what type of dumbfuck comment he's made on Twitter this week.

1030
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:32,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exactly not exactly in that same bubble of love that we have for folks like Iwata.

1031
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:37,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder why.

1032
01:17:37,005 --> 01:17:39,848
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.

1033
01:17:39,848 --> 01:17:41,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see, I was gonna say a lot.

1034
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:42,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew how to code a game.

1035
01:17:42,851 --> 01:17:44,313
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be fair, so did Tim Sweeney.

1036
01:17:44,313 --> 01:17:46,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, Tim Sweeney knew how to code great games.

1037
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes this even more frustrating.

1038
01:17:48,437 --> 01:17:50,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Sweeney's been there.

1039
01:17:50,619 --> 01:17:54,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's very frustrating, actually.

1040
01:17:54,823 --> 01:17:54,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1041
01:17:56,765 --> 01:17:59,947
[SPEAKER_02]: You always, what's the quote?

1042
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: You live long enough to see the hero become the villain, something like that.

1043
01:18:02,968 --> 01:18:06,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's see.

1044
01:18:06,069 --> 01:18:10,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth Dream in chat says, I feel guilty getting all those free games.

1045
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:18,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that was a response to what we were talking about earlier, or perhaps the Epic Game Store and all of their free giveaway games that they do.

1046
01:18:18,395 --> 01:18:20,436
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you shouldn't feel bad about that.

1047
01:18:20,436 --> 01:18:22,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all business deals that they're doing.

1048
01:18:22,817 --> 01:18:27,979
[SPEAKER_02]: They pay the because this was all brought out into the open some time ago through court documents.

1049
01:18:27,979 --> 01:18:36,222
[SPEAKER_02]: They pay those companies a flat fee, say $50,000 for maybe a small indie title to potentially millions for a large AAA title.

1050
01:18:36,222 --> 01:18:39,143
[SPEAKER_02]: They pay money to put that game out there for free.

1051
01:18:39,143 --> 01:18:42,164
[SPEAKER_02]: That again, business decision.

1052
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:51,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you fifth dream in your computer room, office, bedroom, whatever downloading this game and taking advantage of the deal.

1053
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:56,145
[SPEAKER_02]: has nothing to do with the fact that that deal was already signed, sealed, delivered.

1054
01:18:56,145 --> 01:19:00,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the popularity of the game may affect future deals and that sort of thing.

1055
01:19:00,906 --> 01:19:09,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose if you want to go that way, but I don't think you should feel bad about taking the opportunity that was presented to you.

1056
01:19:09,448 --> 01:19:15,670
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's even what the comment was about, because it may have been about the last story to be fair.

1057
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:15,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So

1058
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:28,764
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Roma asked with a very fair comment in chat saying, much respect to Iwata for what we're talking about, but it seems that what Iwata did is more a Japanese cultural thing though.

1059
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:32,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice if more American upper management would do that.

1060
01:19:32,327 --> 01:19:39,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it probably was, in fact, a cultural thing, and it is one of those things where we kind of go,

1061
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:51,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, considering this is the gaming industry and such the weight that the Japanese market plays on the gaming industry, it is a little disappointing we don't see more American executives.

1062
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:53,984
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess that would be un-American for them to do that.

1063
01:19:56,102 --> 01:19:59,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, um, let's see.

1064
01:19:59,225 --> 01:20:04,550
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100mat says, how much of that money that Epic spent fighting with Apple in the courts could have been used to keep staff?

1065
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1066
01:20:05,511 --> 01:20:06,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair.

1067
01:20:06,712 --> 01:20:09,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see.

1068
01:20:09,074 --> 01:20:15,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Questbuster says, from those court docs, Epic noted that they expect Epic Game Store to be profitable in 2023.

1069
01:20:16,447 --> 01:20:22,208
[SPEAKER_02]: But interestingly, Apple also countered saying that they expect it to be profitable by 2027, if ever.

1070
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:25,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what would make the Epic Games Store profitable?

1071
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:28,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a better application.

1072
01:20:28,069 --> 01:20:28,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1073
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:31,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, I'm just gonna call it what it is.

1074
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:36,751
[SPEAKER_02]: For as long as the Epic Games Store has been out, it still feels- How long has it been?

1075
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:41,351
[SPEAKER_02]: A while, and it is still basic as fuck.

1076
01:20:41,351 --> 01:20:44,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially next to something like

1077
01:20:45,172 --> 01:20:47,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic Games Store is still resting on the laurels of Fortnite

1078
01:21:05,854 --> 01:21:29,170
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to carry forward and that is not a read on the hardworking programmers of the store that is a read on the business developers allocating said resources that's why the Epic Games Store is not profitable it's not it's it's not as attractive as Steam that's what it is anyway

1079
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:34,935
[SPEAKER_02]: give me a reason to really use the Epic Games Store outside the free games.

1080
01:21:34,935 --> 01:21:39,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know, there's, oh, yeah, SEO 100 Matt says, How long did it take them to figure out a shopping cart?

1081
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:41,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I remember that one.

1082
01:21:41,423 --> 01:21:42,604
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very complex.

1083
01:21:42,604 --> 01:21:46,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not like something that websites have had since the beginning of the internet.

1084
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:52,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I understand that these, you know, you can't just flip a switch and bam, we have a shopping cart.

1085
01:21:52,372 --> 01:21:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: They are things that you have to, you know, plan to do.

1086
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:57,093
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is my point.

1087
01:21:57,093 --> 01:22:06,116
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an executive's job to be strategically thinking about these types of plans and plan for these types of things.

1088
01:22:06,116 --> 01:22:11,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And if Tim Sweeney has failed on that, where's his cut?

1089
01:22:11,538 --> 01:22:15,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just him, the other senior executives at this company.

1090
01:22:16,316 --> 01:22:20,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's, where's the fall on them?

1091
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:27,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's just, it sucks that here we are yet again, asking that question.

1092
01:22:27,059 --> 01:22:31,140
[SPEAKER_02]: When is an executive going to be held responsible for the mistakes?

1093
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:36,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we still have Bobby Kotick.

1094
01:22:36,422 --> 01:22:41,283
[SPEAKER_02]: The greatest disease on this industry is still gainfully employed.

1095
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:42,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sucks.

1096
01:22:46,516 --> 01:23:06,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Sweeney, honestly, is like a stage... Tim Sweeney is a mini-grunt in stage 1-1 compared to the end boss Bowser, or no, he's Wart, that Bobby Kotick is.

1097
01:23:06,169 --> 01:23:06,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I said it.

1098
01:23:08,457 --> 01:23:10,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on though.

1099
01:23:10,759 --> 01:23:17,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about someone who has another interesting reputation, a reputation of a much different sort in the industry.

1100
01:23:17,943 --> 01:23:24,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Hideki Kamiya, going to be leaving Platinum Games, the studio that he co-founded.

1101
01:23:24,107 --> 01:23:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1102
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:28,130
[SPEAKER_02]: The director of games like Bayonetta, the wonderful 101,

1103
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:32,653
[SPEAKER_02]: He founded this company back in 2006.

1104
01:23:32,653 --> 01:23:36,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was recently promoted even to VP.

1105
01:23:36,856 --> 01:23:42,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But now he said on social media, this was no means by no means excuse me, an easy decision to make.

1106
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:43,540
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's leaving.

1107
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:47,783
[SPEAKER_02]: He's exiting the company on October 12.

1108
01:23:47,783 --> 01:23:53,507
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the why that gets a little more misty, because we don't we don't really get a clear reason here.

1109
01:23:53,507 --> 01:23:58,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But he says the move came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs.

1110
01:23:59,763 --> 01:24:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says he's going to continue to make games, but he doesn't say if he's going to another company, starting another studio, who knows, but he's in his early 50s.

1111
01:24:09,192 --> 01:24:11,494
[SPEAKER_02]: He's only like seven years older than I am.

1112
01:24:11,494 --> 01:24:14,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's probably not retiring.

1113
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:18,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of folks are asking, what's going to happen to Bayonetta?

1114
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,822
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen to these other games?

1115
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:22,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, they'll continue on.

1116
01:24:22,383 --> 01:24:31,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how Bayonetta 3 sold, but I'm assuming if it sold well enough, which I have no reason to think it'll continue on, they'll continue to do it without them.

1117
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:35,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll have creative folks that'll do their own take on it, but I'm sure we'll do fine.

1118
01:24:36,722 --> 01:24:45,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, and on top of that, that would almost give Kamiya a chance to try something similar elsewhere.

1119
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:46,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1120
01:24:46,246 --> 01:24:48,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens.

1121
01:24:48,127 --> 01:24:50,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting.

1122
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:53,410
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

1123
01:24:53,410 --> 01:25:00,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Another series of a game director who's long left the company, but we're still seeing that series continue, DarkSakura.

1124
01:25:01,487 --> 01:25:05,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we brought up, uh, Kojima earlier.

1125
01:25:05,451 --> 01:25:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I'm sure that by now people know about the Psycho Mantis scene in Metal Gear, you know, which was funny.

1126
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:21,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It even mentioned games that hadn't quite come out yet when you would do like the read your memory card thing, you know.

1127
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:31,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So that easter egg is going to stay when the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, when people are playing through that.

1128
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:36,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can make like a virtual memory card so that it would work in the game.

1129
01:25:40,476 --> 01:25:47,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the games that were listed in the Japanese version include Snatcher and Policenauts, for example.

1130
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:49,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty awesome.

1131
01:25:49,384 --> 01:25:52,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if some of that would stay over for the U.S.

1132
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:52,967
[SPEAKER_03]: one.

1133
01:25:52,967 --> 01:25:58,812
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some games that we didn't get but niche versions of them over here.

1134
01:25:58,812 --> 01:26:00,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that that's awesome.

1135
01:26:00,073 --> 01:26:03,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, have some DDR on there maybe.

1136
01:26:03,936 --> 01:26:05,077
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice.

1137
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:05,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1138
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:11,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I yeah, I'm actually looking forward to this collection.

1139
01:26:11,689 --> 01:26:17,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, I have to be honest, you know, the Metal Gear Solid series was one I always kind of, I don't want to say I slept on it.

1140
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:19,771
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, there's there's never enough time to play every game.

1141
01:26:19,771 --> 01:26:21,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never got around to really playing this series.

1142
01:26:21,511 --> 01:26:23,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of excited to revisit it.

1143
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:27,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, I've always heard about this legendary, you know, Psycho Mantis sequence.

1144
01:26:27,533 --> 01:26:29,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've seen this part of the game, of course.

1145
01:26:29,693 --> 01:26:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it like region memory card.

1146
01:26:31,193 --> 01:26:33,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that they kind of found their own way to recreate it.

1147
01:26:33,614 --> 01:26:37,535
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even if it's like a fake memory card you're putting together, like, I still think that's pretty fun.

1148
01:26:39,345 --> 01:26:44,829
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all kinds of like little neat things that you can do in the first Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid.

1149
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:58,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you get a handkerchief from a sniper wolf, I don't remember how to do this, it's been an age, but if you have it equipped like the wolves won't try to attack you because they smell her.

1150
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:08,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So like all kinds of little things on there for, for, you know, uh, doing different things, like even equipping the cigarettes does something in other rooms.

1151
01:27:08,965 --> 01:27:12,646
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, there's all kinds of just little nods.

1152
01:27:12,646 --> 01:27:13,546
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1153
01:27:13,546 --> 01:27:14,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on.

1154
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few more stories, then we're going to get to the classic video game of the week, or are we?

1155
01:27:18,728 --> 01:27:19,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll explain in a minute.

1156
01:27:19,929 --> 01:27:22,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Loki.

1157
01:27:22,049 --> 01:27:22,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.

1158
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:23,790
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is this,

1159
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:34,020
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an event that was done for Van Gogh's 50th anniversary, or I should say the Van Gogh Museum's 50th anniversary.

1160
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:36,121
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been gone a little longer than that.

1161
01:27:36,121 --> 01:27:37,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

1162
01:27:37,522 --> 01:27:41,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, it sounds like a great thing in the beginning.

1163
01:27:41,084 --> 01:27:44,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you then you mentioned that it has to do with Pokemon.

1164
01:27:44,266 --> 01:27:45,647
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh.

1165
01:27:47,126 --> 01:28:01,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of course, with anything Pokemon, from Happy Meals to apparently the Van Gogh Museum's 50th Anniversary, there was several items that were for sale that were exclusive to that.

1166
01:28:02,892 --> 01:28:08,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of course, scalpers and everybody just rushed the place and made a mess of everything.

1167
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:18,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, you know, there is a tote bag from the event for 50 bucks, which also included a Pikachu collector card from the trading card game.

1168
01:28:18,912 --> 01:28:23,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, of course, the trading card game card is up to $700 online.

1169
01:28:23,093 --> 01:28:27,334
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the tote bag's 50 bucks.

1170
01:28:27,334 --> 01:28:31,835
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, you know, people taking artwork and they're scalping it online.

1171
01:28:31,835 --> 01:28:33,715
[SPEAKER_01]: People are disgusting.

1172
01:28:33,715 --> 01:28:35,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you already knew that.

1173
01:28:35,115 --> 01:28:43,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And people that are trying to profit off of scalping this stuff are disgusting.

1174
01:28:43,137 --> 01:28:43,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But.

1175
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:46,811
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you do?

1176
01:28:46,811 --> 01:28:49,192
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing you can do, really.

1177
01:28:49,192 --> 01:28:51,192
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to stop supporting scalpers.

1178
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:53,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that's not going to happen.

1179
01:28:53,193 --> 01:28:55,554
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make a pact.

1180
01:28:55,554 --> 01:28:57,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never supporting scalpers.

1181
01:28:57,034 --> 01:29:01,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there's people out there with a lot of disposable money that'll just keep doing it.

1182
01:29:01,196 --> 01:29:02,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sucks.

1183
01:29:02,577 --> 01:29:03,877
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally feel helpless.

1184
01:29:03,877 --> 01:29:05,458
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you do?

1185
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:05,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1186
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:14,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this is why then this is why some of it's getting ugly, like people meeting scalpers.

1187
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:18,064
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it the PlayStation five scalpers in parking lots just to rob them?

1188
01:29:18,064 --> 01:29:19,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I would ever endorse it.

1189
01:29:19,365 --> 01:29:30,672
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just saying people's frustration with this sort of thing is getting so like it's brimming over that like this is where you see the ugly side of it really coming out, you know, and and all these I'm sure there's plenty of YouTubes of people fucking with scalpers.

1190
01:29:31,092 --> 01:29:39,057
[SPEAKER_01]: They're showing like there's a video on online that's showing people just rushing the gift store and like it's like it's a mob.

1191
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:48,062
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a Black Friday sale mob just rushing in there and just tearing the place apart like.

1192
01:29:48,062 --> 01:29:51,323
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cartoon, it's a trading card game.

1193
01:29:51,323 --> 01:29:53,204
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with you people?

1194
01:29:53,204 --> 01:29:55,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is this really worth it to make a few bucks?

1195
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, apparently they think it is.

1196
01:29:57,687 --> 01:29:59,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1197
01:29:59,028 --> 01:29:59,528
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nuts.

1198
01:30:01,138 --> 01:30:02,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

1199
01:30:02,679 --> 01:30:08,742
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a lot of discussion this evening about kind of the cost, the price of a video game, and how much are you willing to pay for a game.

1200
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:18,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting, in some timely remarks, the president of Capcom, Haruhiro Tsujimoto, suggests that maybe it's time to raise the price of games again.

1201
01:30:18,366 --> 01:30:24,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it wasn't that long ago that we just talked about raising the price to 70 bucks, you know, to support, you know, the

1202
01:30:25,249 --> 01:30:29,392
[SPEAKER_02]: A report on September 23rd from Nikkei had some remarks from Sujimoto at the Tokyo Game Show about some various topics.

1203
01:30:43,005 --> 01:30:50,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Development costs are about 100 times higher than during the Famicom era, but software prices have not gone up that much.

1204
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,198
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also a need to raise wages.

1205
01:30:53,198 --> 01:31:00,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering the fact that wages are rising in the industry as a whole, I think raising unit prices is a healthy option for business.

1206
01:31:01,347 --> 01:31:14,093
[SPEAKER_02]: and then went on to, you know, explain that, you know, recessions and the other factors in the business world, they shouldn't matter when it comes to game prices, but they say those factors have little to do with the game industry.

1207
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:20,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because there's a recession doesn't mean you won't go to the movie theater or your favorite artist concert.

1208
01:31:20,136 --> 01:31:22,597
[SPEAKER_02]: High quality games will continue to sell.

1209
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:34,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, but the problem with that whole statement is assuming that the only cost of a game like back in the Famicom era is the purchase price of the game.

1210
01:31:34,223 --> 01:31:36,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that's absolutely not true.

1211
01:31:36,765 --> 01:31:41,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcom especially knows it's not true because it's not just the game purchase.

1212
01:31:41,487 --> 01:31:43,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a battle pass.

1213
01:31:43,268 --> 01:31:45,209
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the DLC.

1214
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:49,231
[SPEAKER_01]: It is all the other nonsense, the cosmetics and stuff that they throw on top of it.

1215
01:31:49,231 --> 01:31:51,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't even pretend that first off that they're selling a game for $70.

1216
01:31:52,973 --> 01:31:56,315
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they're also making all this money, billions of dollars off the back of stuff.

1217
01:31:56,315 --> 01:31:58,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, here's a funny idea.

1218
01:31:58,136 --> 01:32:03,780
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not profitable to do that, then don't make games that cost so much in development.

1219
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:13,927
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of smaller independent games that require a lot less money, that are solely unique, versus you making Resident Evil some more times.

1220
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:19,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I just don't buy a lot of this stuff.

1221
01:32:19,402 --> 01:32:28,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the cost has gone up for these studios, but no one's forcing them to also employ this many employees to make these complex games.

1222
01:32:28,687 --> 01:32:36,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And even still, when they go and sell a $70 game, not necessarily Capcom in this instance, but it's not up to the quality of what I would consider a $70 product.

1223
01:32:38,342 --> 01:32:42,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I'm sorry, that's just the world it is like, you know, the cost to go to the movies is not $70.

1224
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:46,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sometimes it is, I guess, but it is, you know.

1225
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:50,060
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the upfront cost is there.

1226
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:50,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1227
01:32:50,981 --> 01:32:51,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just ridiculous.

1228
01:32:51,982 --> 01:33:00,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the point he's trying to make when he talks about how the development costs are 100 times higher than the Famicom era, but we're charging a very similar price for games.

1229
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:03,994
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very convenient fact he overlooks in that whole thing.

1230
01:33:03,994 --> 01:33:08,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that the majority of games are now delivered either digitally, which is

1231
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:28,384
[SPEAKER_02]: zero cost or on discs which are relatively extremely low cost compared to what they were in the Famicom era which were these cartridges that were not cheap because essentially you had system parts in a cartridge or if you want to literally say the Famicom disc system still discs that were more expensive than the discs they make today.

1232
01:33:28,384 --> 01:33:31,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's even go back further than that.

1233
01:33:31,225 --> 01:33:38,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to when I was working in the video game industry and let's talk about what it actually costs to bring a game to the market.

1234
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:52,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, your average $60 price point game from Capcom would have been sold to a distributor for $48 because there has to be a margin made in there for the distributor and for retail.

1235
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:54,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So $48 for the game.

1236
01:33:54,411 --> 01:33:56,252
[SPEAKER_01]: $48 is not Capcom's cost on that.

1237
01:33:56,252 --> 01:33:58,193
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making a margin on that as well.

1238
01:33:58,193 --> 01:34:02,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take that $60 game and I would say half of that is profit.

1239
01:34:03,374 --> 01:34:10,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, you're paying, you know, before when they're talking about physical discs being brought out, you know, that there's packaging costs and stuff that went in there.

1240
01:34:10,819 --> 01:34:16,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're talking that they're getting more than 50% profit off of that.

1241
01:34:16,103 --> 01:34:27,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, it may have been more expensive, but now your cost to bring that to the customer is much less and you're making up all of that margin that now you're selling directly through these.

1242
01:34:27,532 --> 01:34:27,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sure.

1243
01:34:27,892 --> 01:34:29,513
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying Sony and stuff, but it,

1244
01:34:30,013 --> 01:34:36,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Capcom is, but now let's look at some of their peers like Ubisoft that tries to sell games direct.

1245
01:34:36,918 --> 01:34:38,699
[SPEAKER_02]: They cut out the distribution too.

1246
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:43,803
[SPEAKER_02]: They become the distributor with things like, whatever the Ubisoft, it's so bad, I never use it.

1247
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:54,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Ubisoft front end is called, or, you know, we'll say the Epic Game Store and publishing Epic Games, you know, they can sell, or Valve, sure, Steam and Valve Games, you know, they self publish, right?

1248
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:57,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or self distribute and publish.

1249
01:34:57,032 --> 01:34:57,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just,

1250
01:34:58,736 --> 01:35:05,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I dunno, like look, I get his point, but he's not making as big of a point as he thinks.

1251
01:35:05,982 --> 01:35:07,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they want us to make us feel bad.

1252
01:35:07,664 --> 01:35:13,089
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, you guys are just really selfish and you really should be paying more for this product that you're giving us.

1253
01:35:13,089 --> 01:35:17,773
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, though, is like, no, you know, if we don't feel like paying that price, then we're just not going to pay that price.

1254
01:35:17,773 --> 01:35:18,654
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it is.

1255
01:35:18,654 --> 01:35:20,836
[SPEAKER_01]: You can charge whatever you want for you.

1256
01:35:20,836 --> 01:35:24,460
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put out three fighter seven for one hundred and twenty dollars.

1257
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Go right ahead.

1258
01:35:25,781 --> 01:35:27,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean people are going to buy it.

1259
01:35:27,042 --> 01:35:30,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might buy it, but that's that you you as a

1260
01:35:31,046 --> 01:35:37,852
[SPEAKER_01]: as Capcom can do whatever you want, but you know, you also have to realize that not everybody's going to agree with you.

1261
01:35:37,852 --> 01:35:42,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So do that as you will.

1262
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:45,359
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel your games are worth more money, then charge more money.

1263
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:48,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, in the back end, you're already charging more money.

1264
01:35:48,401 --> 01:35:55,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And for you, it's your best interest to get people in the ecosystem so they buy all that stupid battle pass and cosmetics and stuff because you want them in the door to do that.

1265
01:35:56,708 --> 01:36:14,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is something I should point out, and this is something that's become abundantly clear to me just with looking at different tech companies in general, is that, I mean, increasing the price of a game, I'm sorry, it's gonna happen, it happens, massively increasing the cost is not the answer.

1266
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:44,092
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what the big thing is that we need the companies need to look at their infrastructure number one and if the current i mean and yeah reorganizing a business is expensive and difficult but look at the companies that haven't had uh you know that have been making profits have not had as many layoffs as some of the others and see what they're doing right you know um you know if

1267
01:36:45,212 --> 01:37:00,547
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have, instead of a big hiring boom, for example, if you keep your new hires, especially, I wouldn't say force that crunch time on anybody, but hire reasonably and don't over-hire.

1268
01:37:01,177 --> 01:37:05,723
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, utilize the people that you already have for for related tasks.

1269
01:37:05,723 --> 01:37:13,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are ways of keeping the costs down, of not hurting your employees and not hurting your consumers.

1270
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:18,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's balance and people don't want to try to do something different.

1271
01:37:20,157 --> 01:37:26,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some great comments in our chat as to 100 Matt says if you keep upping the price at some point a bubble will burst.

1272
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:33,121
[SPEAKER_02]: You put out an $80 game that is two thirds done and buggy as hell your consumers will remember that and guess what won't buy it at full price.

1273
01:37:33,121 --> 01:37:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And quest buster says XO primal has entered the chat.

1274
01:37:36,542 --> 01:37:40,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, what's interesting, I have friends that got super into XO primal because they're playing it on game pass.

1275
01:37:43,137 --> 01:37:51,679
[SPEAKER_02]: SheHulk10 says, actually they could reduce executive salary and stockholder payouts and reduce the price of the games by 80%.

1276
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:57,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that comment.

1277
01:37:57,680 --> 01:38:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: BobbyBlackWolf with a bit of a realist perspective to that saying, reducing stockholder payouts has the consequence of the stockholders selling all their shares and the company goes out of business due to lack of funds, which is a whole other argument about

1278
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:15,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Publicly traded companies in the first place, but we don't have time for that.

1279
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:20,850
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do have time for is our next segment, which comes with it very own bumper.

1280
01:38:31,643 --> 01:38:39,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1281
01:38:39,408 --> 01:38:43,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1282
01:38:43,271 --> 01:38:47,714
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but once a month, DarkSakura does not pick a video game.

1283
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:53,418
[SPEAKER_02]: She picks a not video game in a 2023 twist to talk about instead.

1284
01:38:53,418 --> 01:38:56,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So DarkSakura, what is the classic not video game of the month?

1285
01:38:57,988 --> 01:39:03,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Classic Not Video Game Month actually has an evolved version.

1286
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:05,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked Mystery Date.

1287
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:13,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mystery Date was first of all created in 1965 with reissues in 1970, 1999, and 2005.

1288
01:39:13,153 --> 01:39:13,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1289
01:39:19,355 --> 01:39:28,501
[SPEAKER_03]: an evolved version, the 1999 version is an evolved version and I'll get to the name of that one and you'll know what it is.

1290
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:42,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mystery Date is a game that was marketed from girls from 16 to 14 and it was conceived of by a guy, so of course it's very

1291
01:39:44,692 --> 01:39:48,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It was conceived by a man named Marvin Glass and created by Henry Stann.

1292
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:18,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvin Glass & Associates, by the way, was a toy design engineering firm in Chicago, and some of the other games to their credit is Mr. Machine, Rock'em Sock'em Robots, Light Bright, Ants in the Pants, Mousetrap, Operation, Simon, and the evil Knievel stunt cycle.

1293
01:40:20,571 --> 01:40:30,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So, going back, you can play with 2, 3, or 4 players, and the object of the game is to find the best date while avoiding, quote, the dud.

1294
01:40:31,209 --> 01:40:44,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Right away, this game is reinforcing very terrible social stereotypes and all kinds of pretty nasty things.

1295
01:40:44,325 --> 01:40:50,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very problematic just right from the get-go, but not many people, I guess, thought that it was at the time.

1296
01:40:50,673 --> 01:41:03,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, you have to assemble an outfit by finding three matching color-coded cards, and then you have to match the outfit of the date that's at the mystery door.

1297
01:41:04,768 --> 01:41:08,329
[SPEAKER_03]: There was actually a big door in the middle of it.

1298
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:15,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So the date is revealed by spinning the door handle and opening the door on the game board.

1299
01:41:15,551 --> 01:41:19,752
[SPEAKER_03]: You have five possible dates.

1300
01:41:19,752 --> 01:41:25,253
[SPEAKER_03]: The formal dance date, the bowling date, the beach date, the skiing date, and the dud.

1301
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:33,155
[SPEAKER_03]: The dud is poorly dressed, wearing sloppy clothes, messy hair, and he has a beard shadow.

1302
01:41:36,387 --> 01:41:45,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, that just sounds like any guy I ever went out with in the 90s, I would say, for the few that I did.

1303
01:41:45,531 --> 01:41:47,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was grunge.

1304
01:41:47,232 --> 01:41:49,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

1305
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:54,155
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1970s version, the bowling date was replaced by a picnic date.

1306
01:41:54,155 --> 01:42:00,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if your outfit does not match the date behind the door, the door is closed and you continue.

1307
01:42:01,143 --> 01:42:10,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is where we go up to the 90s, speaking of which, and its evolution.

1308
01:42:10,371 --> 01:42:13,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Electronic dream phone.

1309
01:42:13,773 --> 01:42:15,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we do we know this one?

1310
01:42:15,975 --> 01:42:18,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you a little secret about it.

1311
01:42:18,037 --> 01:42:27,284
[SPEAKER_03]: The box had a a picture of a young Chris Evans on it as Tyler, the beach date.

1312
01:42:27,284 --> 01:42:27,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.

1313
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:34,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so anyway, this was like the 90s game.

1314
01:42:34,509 --> 01:42:46,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a big ass, well, more like the phone looked like it was this big pink, and it's now playing on the thing, by the way, but this little monstrosity.

1315
01:42:46,231 --> 01:42:49,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would have to find the hot guy.

1316
01:42:49,192 --> 01:42:53,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have killed to have a big pink phone like that, just saying.

1317
01:42:53,192 --> 01:42:55,593
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to find the hot guy who had the crush on you.

1318
01:42:55,593 --> 01:42:56,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So huge.

1319
01:42:57,451 --> 01:43:03,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So you use the pink phone to talk to guys to gather clues.

1320
01:43:03,476 --> 01:43:09,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like where someone wasn't eating, what he wasn't wearing, where he didn't like to hang out.

1321
01:43:09,881 --> 01:43:16,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had other ones say, I know who it is, but I'm not telling.

1322
01:43:16,386 --> 01:43:17,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

1323
01:43:17,047 --> 01:43:18,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I played this game at one time.

1324
01:43:18,748 --> 01:43:24,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear I went over to my sister's friend's house and we played this with the phone.

1325
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:35,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you're using the process of elimination to figure out who was the crush and then you call them to confirm.

1326
01:43:35,195 --> 01:43:38,921
[SPEAKER_03]: So the crush is basically...

1327
01:43:40,388 --> 01:43:42,670
[SPEAKER_03]: The same person for all the players.

1328
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:47,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first girl who guesses it is the winner, pretty much.

1329
01:43:47,453 --> 01:43:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I don't know.

1330
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:56,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you had, uh, guys who hung out in different places like the mall or Woodland Park.

1331
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:01,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you had, uh, a few different guys.

1332
01:44:01,143 --> 01:44:06,067
[SPEAKER_03]: You had, uh, Bob, Scott, Tyler,

1333
01:44:07,455 --> 01:44:10,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary, Dan, Spencer, Jamal.

1334
01:44:10,837 --> 01:44:12,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Very 90s looking fellas.

1335
01:44:12,578 --> 01:44:13,599
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some other ones.

1336
01:44:13,599 --> 01:44:16,560
[SPEAKER_03]: The bowl cut, especially.

1337
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:22,944
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you... Basically, it's really the evolved version of the same game.

1338
01:44:22,944 --> 01:44:23,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It truly is.

1339
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:25,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to my grave saying so.

1340
01:44:25,905 --> 01:44:29,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I picked the game that I did.

1341
01:44:29,027 --> 01:44:32,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas on the board game, you're rolling dice.

1342
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:35,331
[SPEAKER_03]: But the phone game, I mean, it's...

1343
01:44:38,204 --> 01:44:58,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny, there's a book called Timeless Toys, and they compared Mystery Date, and I'm going to quote this, it was the result of crossing Barbie in all her high fashion glory with 1965's biggest game show, Let's Make a Deal, calling it an example of simple yet ingenious quality of games that are associated with Marvin Glass.

1344
01:45:02,542 --> 01:45:08,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It absolutely is problematic at its core.

1345
01:45:08,786 --> 01:45:22,333
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is basically camping on stereotypes, using aesthetics as nothing but the judge of another person's quality.

1346
01:45:25,135 --> 01:45:33,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly enough, the Mystery Phone one is, I think, better off.

1347
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:37,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're all supposed to be hotties.

1348
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:38,468
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the game.

1349
01:45:38,468 --> 01:45:41,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Problematic, yes, but iconic, also yes.

1350
01:45:42,567 --> 01:45:47,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystery Date, the classic non video game of the week.

1351
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:49,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mystery phone with it.

1352
01:45:49,311 --> 01:45:51,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I was I was somewhat familiar with this game.

1353
01:45:51,632 --> 01:45:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played it, unfortunately.

1354
01:45:53,453 --> 01:45:58,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like I would say I wanted to play Mall Madness a lot more than my lady friends had.

1355
01:45:58,816 --> 01:46:01,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play Mall Madness, which you've already featured this year.

1356
01:46:01,557 --> 01:46:03,198
[SPEAKER_02]: But I never did play Mystery Date.

1357
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:06,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way you describe it, because you're trying to kind of guess like what's in the center of the board.

1358
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,462
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me think that Clue is just mystery murder.

1359
01:46:09,462 --> 01:46:10,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1360
01:46:10,222 --> 01:46:12,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Clue just mystery murder then?

1361
01:46:12,433 --> 01:46:15,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Clue is Mystery Murder.

1362
01:46:15,094 --> 01:46:19,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did Clue, didn't I?

1363
01:46:19,055 --> 01:46:22,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it came out before, well before this, though.

1364
01:46:22,496 --> 01:46:23,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1365
01:46:23,296 --> 01:46:23,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1366
01:46:23,576 --> 01:46:24,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to check the wiki.

1367
01:46:24,477 --> 01:46:25,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the 40s.

1368
01:46:25,537 --> 01:46:28,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1369
01:46:28,138 --> 01:46:31,179
[SPEAKER_03]: The first manufactured version of Cluedo was in 1949.

1370
01:46:31,179 --> 01:46:32,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1371
01:46:32,139 --> 01:46:34,520
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so.

1372
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:34,920
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1373
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So this game just took murder and turned it into dating.

1374
01:46:37,221 --> 01:46:38,521
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1375
01:46:38,521 --> 01:46:38,881
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1376
01:46:38,881 --> 01:46:41,842
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we took the murder game and made it less murdery?

1377
01:46:45,363 --> 01:46:46,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, great pick.

1378
01:46:46,846 --> 01:46:47,827
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1379
01:46:47,827 --> 01:46:51,213
[SPEAKER_03]: We could revamp this game.

1380
01:46:51,213 --> 01:46:55,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could make it very, very, very, very gay.

1381
01:46:55,902 --> 01:46:57,122
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

1382
01:46:57,122 --> 01:46:59,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm of course I'm all for that.

1383
01:46:59,043 --> 01:47:01,043
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think even better.

1384
01:47:01,043 --> 01:47:07,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think something that everybody would understand would be Mystery Kitty, which which kitties which kitties at your front door?

1385
01:47:07,144 --> 01:47:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Meow, meow, meowing.

1386
01:47:08,324 --> 01:47:10,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's it's Mystery Kitty would be the way to play the game.

1387
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:11,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1388
01:47:11,585 --> 01:47:13,085
[SPEAKER_03]: You found a dead rat.

1389
01:47:13,085 --> 01:47:14,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It has Black Cat fur on it.

1390
01:47:14,786 --> 01:47:16,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I play that game in real life.

1391
01:47:16,646 --> 01:47:22,207
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's in my neighborhood is is this Black Cat Midna?

1392
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:28,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to always look in the house first.

1393
01:47:28,353 --> 01:47:29,513
[SPEAKER_03]: My cat's in the house.

1394
01:47:29,513 --> 01:47:30,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my cat.

1395
01:47:30,414 --> 01:47:36,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw on my Facebook feed the other day, and it's a legit thing because it's legitimately on their website.

1396
01:47:36,938 --> 01:47:43,003
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a spirit Halloween store themed Monopoly board.

1397
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:43,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

1398
01:47:44,452 --> 01:47:46,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's buying that?

1399
01:47:46,012 --> 01:47:46,653
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have it.

1400
01:47:46,653 --> 01:47:49,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that just for the what the fuckness of it.

1401
01:47:49,393 --> 01:47:49,813
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it.

1402
01:47:49,813 --> 01:47:58,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's funny, because like the first the first section of properties on the border, like abandoned mall shop, abandoned like this shop.

1403
01:47:58,176 --> 01:48:03,277
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like all the different places you'd find a spirit Halloween store.

1404
01:48:03,277 --> 01:48:04,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was funny.

1405
01:48:04,598 --> 01:48:08,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never would imagine that as a thing.

1406
01:48:08,459 --> 01:48:10,019
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a thing.

1407
01:48:10,019 --> 01:48:13,520
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the equivalent of Boardwalk, former former Target store in San Francisco?

1408
01:48:14,823 --> 01:48:18,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I'll tell you what, I will look it up.

1409
01:48:18,328 --> 01:48:29,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And while you do that, well, actually don't go too far, Loki, because we need you to tackle some rapid fire news for us as we travel around the gaming world and look quickly at some other headlines and things that are going on.

1410
01:48:31,428 --> 01:48:38,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we've got a surprise game announcement, actually a surprise game release.

1411
01:48:38,735 --> 01:48:49,766
[SPEAKER_01]: It is called Elder Scrolls Castle, and Elder Scrolls Castle is basically an Elder Scrolls skinned version of Fallout Shelter, which, that sounds cool.

1412
01:48:50,407 --> 01:48:56,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a thing that is got shadow dropped on the 28th of September and you can check it out.

1413
01:48:56,632 --> 01:48:59,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's it's out on Google Play right now.

1414
01:48:59,395 --> 01:49:04,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming Steam as well and probably consoles at some point.

1415
01:49:04,799 --> 01:49:07,141
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it looks like we get the screenshots.

1416
01:49:07,141 --> 01:49:14,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much exactly Fallout Shelters, but now with Elder Scrolls, which I am down for.

1417
01:49:14,847 --> 01:49:15,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have to check it out.

1418
01:49:15,854 --> 01:49:17,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I might check that out.

1419
01:49:17,075 --> 01:49:20,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Fallout Shelter wasn't bad, but I'm not really super into the Fallout universe.

1420
01:49:20,937 --> 01:49:24,219
[SPEAKER_02]: But Elder Scrolls, that I could go along with.

1421
01:49:24,219 --> 01:49:28,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got five new tracks coming to F-Zero 99.

1422
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:35,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got now two normal F-Zero 99, Mute City 2, Port Town 1, and Red Canyon 1.

1423
01:49:35,026 --> 01:49:39,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the pro tracks, they have Whiteland 2 and Death Wind 2.

1424
01:49:39,509 --> 01:49:45,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently the Queen League will also be appearing in the Grand Prix events as well.

1425
01:49:46,674 --> 01:49:48,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't played F-Zero 99.

1426
01:49:48,195 --> 01:49:50,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't either.

1427
01:49:50,255 --> 01:49:52,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, I should be supporting F-Zero.

1428
01:49:52,816 --> 01:50:00,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And just be like, specifically, we're not bringing a new F-Zero game because that Rob Roberts didn't play F-Zero 99.

1429
01:50:00,359 --> 01:50:02,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We had him specifically targeted for this.

1430
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:06,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, yep, we're gonna green light this game as soon as he plays.

1431
01:50:06,802 --> 01:50:07,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing happened.

1432
01:50:07,582 --> 01:50:08,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's me.

1433
01:50:08,262 --> 01:50:09,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm the problem.

1434
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:09,843
[SPEAKER_02]: It's me.

1435
01:50:13,151 --> 01:50:18,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, DarkSakura, how about another game I've overlooked completely that I should be playing?

1436
01:50:18,395 --> 01:50:20,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Samba de Amigo!

1437
01:50:20,877 --> 01:50:28,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So Samba de Amigo Party Central had two more DLC packs on the 28th and more to come.

1438
01:50:29,203 --> 01:50:38,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, what we have so far is the Sonic and Japan Culture ones already came out on, uh, in, uh, August.

1439
01:50:38,568 --> 01:50:46,132
[SPEAKER_03]: For September, we had the Sega Music Pack and the, uh, K-Pop Pack.

1440
01:50:46,132 --> 01:50:54,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, this month, October, we're gonna have, uh, the Persona and, uh, Virtual Singer Packs.

1441
01:50:54,376 --> 01:50:56,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two Mystery ones in November.

1442
01:50:57,898 --> 01:51:04,905
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Phantom Thieves music pack will have colors flying high, life will change, and rivers in the desert.

1443
01:51:04,905 --> 01:51:09,949
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Joker and Morgana costume and accessories pack.

1444
01:51:09,949 --> 01:51:16,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Virtual Singer pack has the vampire, phony, and goodbye declaration.

1445
01:51:16,556 --> 01:51:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a day go.

1446
01:51:18,707 --> 01:51:25,449
[SPEAKER_01]: To answer your question, Rob, what is in the boardwalk position on the Spirit Monopoly board?

1447
01:51:25,449 --> 01:51:29,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unfortunately underwhelming, just like this entire board is.

1448
01:51:29,031 --> 01:51:32,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the Spirit Halloween corporate office.

1449
01:51:32,532 --> 01:51:33,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1450
01:51:33,552 --> 01:51:35,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo.

1451
01:51:35,053 --> 01:51:36,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1452
01:51:36,353 --> 01:51:36,653
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1453
01:51:36,653 --> 01:51:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that even at?

1454
01:51:37,494 --> 01:51:38,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be in the L.A.

1455
01:51:38,334 --> 01:51:41,055
[SPEAKER_04]: area.

1456
01:51:41,055 --> 01:51:41,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1457
01:51:41,435 --> 01:51:43,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's on the Monopoly board.

1458
01:51:43,676 --> 01:51:45,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming it's in boardwalk.

1459
01:51:45,757 --> 01:51:46,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1460
01:51:46,905 --> 01:51:50,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't those all, wasn't the original Monopoly all based off New Jersey, Atlantic City?

1461
01:51:50,758 --> 01:51:51,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that what it's all based off of?

1462
01:51:55,008 --> 01:52:00,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of cities and speaking of games that I'd love to play, but we know I never will, Cities Skylines 2.

1463
01:52:00,731 --> 01:52:01,672
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1464
01:52:01,672 --> 01:52:05,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of the spiritual successor in many ways to SimCity because we all saw what EA did to SimCity.

1465
01:52:05,954 --> 01:52:10,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people went to Cities Skylines, which was a pretty awesome city building sim.

1466
01:52:10,376 --> 01:52:13,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people very excited about Cities Skylines 2.

1467
01:52:13,378 --> 01:52:21,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can continue to be excited until spring 2024 when the game will be out on the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and S. But

1468
01:52:22,082 --> 01:52:26,945
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are wanting to play the PC version of the game, it is still coming out October 24th, 2023.

1469
01:52:26,945 --> 01:52:30,167
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a few weeks as it was originally planned.

1470
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:32,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a heads up there.

1471
01:52:32,088 --> 01:52:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the minimum and recommended PC specs have gone a little higher though.

1472
01:52:35,951 --> 01:52:39,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you haven't looked at those lately, you might want to take a look.

1473
01:52:39,573 --> 01:52:40,794
[SPEAKER_02]: There is that.

1474
01:52:40,794 --> 01:52:46,738
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if otherwise, if you want to check out the other versions of the games, the console versions are coming out a little bit later.

1475
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:53,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Heads up, City Skylines 2 is still coming to PC Game Pass as well, if you want to check it out that way.

1476
01:52:53,382 --> 01:52:58,285
[SPEAKER_02]: It will come out to Xbox Game Pass when the console version of the game comes out.

1477
01:52:58,285 --> 01:53:01,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's cool that it is on Game Pass at least.

1478
01:53:01,487 --> 01:53:07,771
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost is one less barrier to getting to play that, so that's kind of cool.

1479
01:53:07,771 --> 01:53:09,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So, City Skylines 2.

1480
01:53:09,712 --> 01:53:14,555
[SPEAKER_02]: FifthDreamInChat says, I always play City Builders for two days, then drop off.

1481
01:53:15,718 --> 01:53:23,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, SSTO 100 Matt, funny enough, it is the Spirit Corporate Headquarters is in New Jersey, Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey.

1482
01:53:23,183 --> 01:53:24,744
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

1483
01:53:24,744 --> 01:53:25,065
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1484
01:53:25,065 --> 01:53:26,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1485
01:53:26,806 --> 01:53:34,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's move on and check out some release dates, some things we're going to be playing a little sooner than the Cities Skylines 2 console release.

1486
01:53:34,471 --> 01:53:36,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start in the US, Loki.

1487
01:53:36,813 --> 01:53:42,177
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Bilkin's Folly on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1488
01:53:43,680 --> 01:54:08,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Trepang2 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Disgaea7, that's gonna be on, or Disgaea7, Vows of the Virtueless on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 Ignystone on PC, iOS, and Android Ira on PC InHisTime on PC

1489
01:54:10,424 --> 01:54:15,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Scorn is coming out on PlayStation 5.

1490
01:54:15,269 --> 01:54:20,093
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also got Silent Hope on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1491
01:54:20,093 --> 01:54:25,238
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lamplighters League on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1492
01:54:25,238 --> 01:54:29,742

[SPEAKER_01]: And last but not least, Sunshine Manor on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1501
01:56:08,867 --> 01:56:14,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases there, it's actually very similar to what Loki just read.

1502
01:56:14,089 --> 01:56:16,289
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of overlap this week between the regions.

1503
01:56:16,289 --> 01:56:23,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always that way, but this week we also have on the Nintendo Switch, we'll start there, Detective Pikachu Returns gets its release in Japan.

1504
01:56:23,032 --> 01:56:27,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much the whole world is coming out the same day, as Nintendo games do these days.

1505
01:56:27,273 --> 01:56:33,295
[SPEAKER_02]: However, also of interest, the Mario Red edition of the Switch OLED model is also out.

1506
01:56:33,655 --> 01:56:37,496
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't actually have Mario on it, but it's just in the Mario red color.

1507
01:56:37,496 --> 01:56:39,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to see if maybe it's on the dock.

1508
01:56:39,316 --> 01:56:42,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there might be a picture of Mario on the dock.

1509
01:56:42,577 --> 01:56:44,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, it's just the Switch logo that's on the dock there.

1510
01:56:44,758 --> 01:56:49,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So but it's it's that, you know, iconic Mario red, I guess, if anything else.

1511
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:59,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in repack, repackaging news, maybe as you're buying that new OLED model, you might pick up Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the booster course pass included.

1512
01:56:59,121 --> 01:57:02,582
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a re-release, if you will, that is hitting the shelves in Japan this week.

1513
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:03,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming

1514
01:57:03,722 --> 01:57:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: for the quote-unquote holiday season or I guess more appropriately end-of-year season for Japan since we all know Christmas works a little differently there.

1515
01:57:13,613 --> 01:57:14,974
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we see on the Switch.

1516
01:57:14,974 --> 01:57:22,222
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation 5, again some overlap with what we've just heard about, Assassin's Creed Mirage gets a release in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.

1517
01:57:22,983 --> 01:57:35,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Sword Art Online, as Loki referred to, also released in Japan, but you know you get your limited edition and your 10th anniversary memorial limited edition on the PlayStation 5, because of course you do.

1518
01:57:35,208 --> 01:57:43,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And a game called Gord is also out in Japan this week, which it looks like it's a multi-language edition of a game being brought over.

1519
01:57:43,931 --> 01:57:45,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it for Japan.

1520
01:57:45,412 --> 01:57:46,272
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Europe, DarkSakura?

1521
01:57:48,054 --> 01:57:54,259
[SPEAKER_03]: On the third for PlayStation and Xbox, we'll have Tripong2, or maybe it's Squared.

1522
01:57:54,259 --> 01:57:56,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the two, it looks like Squared.

1523
01:57:56,541 --> 01:57:59,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Scorn, Special Deluxe Edition.

1524
01:57:59,444 --> 01:58:02,826
[SPEAKER_03]: For Switch, we have Silent Hope.

1525
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:06,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Also for PlayStation, Paleo Pines Dino Valley.

1526
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:11,755
[SPEAKER_03]: For Xbox and PlayStation, we have Everspace 2 Stellar Edition.

1527
01:58:11,755 --> 01:58:15,880
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 4th for Xbox, we have Warhammer 40K Darktide.

1528
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:21,086
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 5th for PlayStation, Cricket 24.

1529
01:58:21,086 --> 01:58:25,031
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have for PlayStation and Xbox, Assassin's Creed Mirage.

1530
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:27,113
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 6th, Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition.

1531
01:58:28,554 --> 01:58:29,755
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for Switch.

1532
01:58:29,755 --> 01:58:33,556
[SPEAKER_03]: For PlayStation, we have Fort Solis Limited Edition.

1533
01:58:33,556 --> 01:58:36,358
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation, Xbox, NHL 24.

1534
01:58:36,358 --> 01:58:40,199
[SPEAKER_03]: For all three, Harvest Moon, The Winds of Anthos.

1535
01:58:40,199 --> 01:58:44,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for Switch, there's Detective Pikachu Returns.

1536
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:49,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for Xbox and PlayStation, we have Sword Art Online, Last Recollection.

1537
01:58:51,132 --> 01:58:52,273
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1538
01:58:52,273 --> 01:58:54,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few more headlines for you.

1539
01:58:54,034 --> 01:59:01,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will open up the phones to our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord and the green room.

1540
01:59:01,798 --> 01:59:05,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We also will invite your emails participate at orangelandrater.com.

1541
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:10,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I think we are another week with no emails, but we'll double check on that in a moment.

1542
01:59:10,122 --> 01:59:12,924
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, we have some headlines.

1543
01:59:12,924 --> 01:59:15,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless Kylie lyrics count.

1544
01:59:15,765 --> 01:59:16,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I read that last week.

1545
01:59:16,886 --> 01:59:18,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you can actually delete that.

1546
01:59:18,067 --> 01:59:18,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah.

1547
01:59:20,824 --> 01:59:23,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Kylie lyrics always count.

1548
01:59:23,546 --> 01:59:34,214
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the nearby establishment, The Bolt, which my friend and I go to occasionally, and we always take over the jukebox there.

1549
01:59:34,214 --> 01:59:38,157
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last three months, we make it our mission to play Padam Padam every night that we're there.

1550
01:59:38,897 --> 01:59:42,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started putting Kylie Minogue's Tension, the single in that.

1551
01:59:42,919 --> 01:59:49,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And now my favorite song on the new album, Hold On To Now, for whatever reason, that song, I don't know if that's the next single.

1552
01:59:49,001 --> 01:59:50,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably ought to be.

1553
01:59:50,142 --> 01:59:52,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But that song has now hit the jukebox too.

1554
01:59:52,203 --> 01:59:53,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can play that too.

1555
01:59:53,983 --> 01:59:58,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So we play a lot of Kylie at the club.

1556
01:59:58,005 --> 01:59:59,786
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just can't get her out of my head.

1557
01:59:59,786 --> 02:00:00,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1558
02:00:00,286 --> 02:00:00,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1559
02:00:00,846 --> 02:00:03,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would we?

1560
02:00:03,007 --> 02:00:04,508
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1561
02:00:04,508 --> 02:00:04,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway,

1562
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:08,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Kylie Minogue, official singer of Orange Sound Radio.

1563
02:00:08,292 --> 02:00:14,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, like the day she hit DDR with what song was it?

1564
02:00:14,035 --> 02:00:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.

1565
02:00:16,857 --> 02:00:24,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Love at First Sight was the song that was in DDR Max 2, and that was that like countries were changed that day.

1566
02:00:24,821 --> 02:00:26,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was only the home version, though.

1567
02:00:26,642 --> 02:00:26,822
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.

1568
02:00:29,449 --> 02:00:54,647
[SPEAKER_02]: over to the actual human wasn't locomotion like a really throwback wasn't that in one of the euro stage fixes like way back when I feel like it was uh maybe yeah anyway all right enough DDR reminiscing let's look forward to the future because this is some interest especially with all the shit talking on executives I've been doing tonight this is some interesting news isn't it Loki

1569
02:00:55,424 --> 02:01:02,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jim Ryan, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO, is retiring after four years on the job.

1570
02:01:02,745 --> 02:01:09,267
[SPEAKER_01]: After 30 years, I've made the decision to retire from SIE in March of 2024.

1571
02:01:09,267 --> 02:01:17,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I've relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners.

1572
02:01:17,008 --> 02:01:22,269
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America.

1573
02:01:22,269 --> 02:01:23,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable, I guess.

1574
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:24,950
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a heck of a commute.

1575
02:01:26,886 --> 02:01:28,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1576
02:01:28,467 --> 02:01:33,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Ryan Seacrest quit live with Ryan and Kelly for the record.

1577
02:01:33,292 --> 02:01:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar reason.

1578
02:01:35,434 --> 02:01:38,697
[SPEAKER_02]: He couldn't stand the commute.

1579
02:01:38,697 --> 02:01:41,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Important stuff.

1580
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,261
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1581
02:01:43,261 --> 02:01:44,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

1582
02:01:44,462 --> 02:01:44,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1583
02:01:44,883 --> 02:01:48,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who's going to be taking over then, or I'm sure they'll probably have to, you know,

1584
02:01:49,633 --> 02:01:51,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure that out, but that's interesting.

1585
02:01:51,437 --> 02:01:56,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be interesting to see who's gonna head up Sony and what that means for the PlayStation.

1586
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:08,169
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I feel like things have been a little bit down on PlayStation front this generation not to I mean, the PS5 still selling like in that ultimately is the only thing that fucking matters.

1587
02:02:08,169 --> 02:02:09,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, it is what it is.

1588
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:20,521
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not forget just recently, we had like, please let's not forget the price of PlayStation Plus went up extremely by a lot for literally no reason.

1589
02:02:20,521 --> 02:02:21,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, you know,

1590
02:02:21,882 --> 02:02:25,645
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because games cost a hundred times more than what they used to.

1591
02:02:25,645 --> 02:02:28,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys need to pay more to play those games.

1592
02:02:28,347 --> 02:02:30,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And PlayStation Now, don't forget that.

1593
02:02:30,488 --> 02:02:33,731
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some of the PR mess that has been bungled a little bit lately.

1594
02:02:33,731 --> 02:02:36,693
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, look, I get Jim Ryan's reason.

1595
02:02:36,693 --> 02:02:39,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's at some point people want to retire.

1596
02:02:39,655 --> 02:02:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

1597
02:02:40,616 --> 02:02:46,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, I don't think you can directly say, oh, it's because of all this negativity that he's retiring now.

1598
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:48,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, it probably has nothing to do with that.

1599
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:49,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It's but it's still interesting.

1600
02:02:49,702 --> 02:03:01,186
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't want to whoever the new leader is has to kind of bear that responsibility to, you know, make make Sony popular and fun with the kids again, I suppose.

1601
02:03:01,186 --> 02:03:06,088
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing to know when to retire and not just to hold on to the job until you literally drop dead.

1602
02:03:06,907 --> 02:03:12,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as Joe and Matt does point out, Hiroki, Totoki will be the interim, but that's just interim.

1603
02:03:12,030 --> 02:03:13,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if that will be permanent.

1604
02:03:13,431 --> 02:03:18,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a fair point because I want to say Nintendo had an interim person too.

1605
02:03:18,555 --> 02:03:24,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when Iwata passed, so, you know, it's just the ebbs and flows of all this stuff.

1606
02:03:25,539 --> 02:03:28,962
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, very important update on something we were talking about.

1607
02:03:28,962 --> 02:03:34,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Wright says The Locomotion by Kylie Minogue was in Dance Maniacs.

1608
02:03:34,327 --> 02:03:35,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It was and it was a cover.

1609
02:03:35,988 --> 02:03:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was still The Locomotion, but it was a cover.

1610
02:03:37,549 --> 02:03:39,050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not which to be fair, I think.

1611
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was hers as a cover.

1612
02:03:40,572 --> 02:03:43,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an old, old song from like the 50s.

1613
02:03:43,134 --> 02:03:46,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think or was it Kylie's version that was in that game?

1614
02:03:46,236 --> 02:03:46,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1615
02:03:46,737 --> 02:03:47,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Wright, clarify.

1616
02:03:49,326 --> 02:03:49,546
[SPEAKER_03]: and a

1617
02:04:11,666 --> 02:04:13,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Orange Right says it was a bass cover.

1618
02:04:13,828 --> 02:04:19,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how Dance Maniacs took a lot from the bass series as did the actual DDR solo bass and all that.

1619
02:04:19,712 --> 02:04:21,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get it.

1620
02:04:21,773 --> 02:04:22,554
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1621
02:04:22,554 --> 02:04:23,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to know.

1622
02:04:23,114 --> 02:04:25,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that song actually predates Kylie.

1623
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:29,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So oh, well, but we still associate her with it.

1624
02:04:29,879 --> 02:04:30,299
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1625
02:04:30,299 --> 02:04:32,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, on to some other news.

1626
02:04:32,961 --> 02:04:33,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of sad.

1627
02:04:33,742 --> 02:04:34,122
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1628
02:04:35,798 --> 02:04:36,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1629
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:46,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, basically, uh, character designer behind, uh, Shining Force and Landstalker, uh, Tamaki Yoshitaka has, uh, died.

1630
02:04:46,205 --> 02:04:50,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he was 55 years old and he died in July of this year.

1631
02:04:50,528 --> 02:04:52,969
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just finding out, um, of cancer.

1632
02:04:52,969 --> 02:04:55,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So rest in peace.

1633
02:04:55,191 --> 02:05:02,796
[SPEAKER_03]: He did stuff like, not just those, but also Timestalkers and actually a bunch of the Shining Force games.

1634
02:05:02,796 --> 02:05:04,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1635
02:05:05,238 --> 02:05:06,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's sad.

1636
02:05:06,419 --> 02:05:17,553
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also sad that we've gone so long without hearing but I understand at some point people retire out of video games to their private life and you know, sometimes takes word for or time for word to get around.

1637
02:05:17,553 --> 02:05:23,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, it just seems to be like a

1638
02:05:27,075 --> 02:05:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTutsi in chat says, I did play The Shining Force on Sega CD.

1639
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:38,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So some memories there, some fond memories about some of the games that he was involved with.

1640
02:05:38,526 --> 02:05:44,772
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on to some other not great news out of Sega of a different sort, Loki.

1641
02:05:45,565 --> 02:05:48,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's more cancellation news.

1642
02:05:48,688 --> 02:05:50,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

1643
02:05:50,309 --> 02:05:56,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So SIG has canceled a game called Hyenas, which I literally forgot about.

1644
02:05:56,834 --> 02:06:01,138
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not aware of what this even was.

1645
02:06:01,138 --> 02:06:05,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, it's a sci-fi space piracy multiplayer FPS.

1646
02:06:05,761 --> 02:06:07,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.

1647
02:06:07,102 --> 02:06:13,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so it was like a PvE type thing or PvP, that type of thing.

1648
02:06:15,072 --> 02:06:24,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, though, they said that on September 11th, this is the game wrapped up its most recent betas, and apparently they've confirmed it's canceled.

1649
02:06:24,714 --> 02:06:29,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.

1650
02:06:29,116 --> 02:06:34,717
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so sorry to announce the end of Hyena's development before we even bring out the full version to you.

1651
02:06:34,717 --> 02:06:41,599
[SPEAKER_01]: While the decision to cancel the project has not been made lightly, we know that this doesn't make it easier for you to accept.

1652
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:42,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, they don't say why.

1653
02:06:45,452 --> 02:06:48,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I mean, that sucks.

1654
02:06:48,434 --> 02:07:00,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with that, though, of course, Creative Assembly has announced that, or they had made an announcement, I think, of layoffs.

1655
02:07:00,957 --> 02:07:13,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made a decision to begin our redundancy consultation process in some of our areas of UK operations alongside any development of hyenas.

1656
02:07:13,243 --> 02:07:16,925
[SPEAKER_01]: This may unfortunately result in job losses.

1657
02:07:16,925 --> 02:07:25,090
[SPEAKER_01]: We fully understand that this has a significant impact on our people and whether or not they are affected or not, which we are truly sorry.

1658
02:07:28,263 --> 02:07:45,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're going to try to relocate anybody whose roles they can relocate to equivalent positions, I guess, in California to minimize any job losses, but there still will probably be job losses.

1659
02:07:45,267 --> 02:07:46,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunate.

1660
02:07:46,967 --> 02:07:47,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1661
02:07:47,807 --> 02:07:50,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So why was Hyenas cancelled?

1662
02:07:50,508 --> 02:07:51,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

1663
02:07:51,717 --> 02:07:55,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think like it had recently done a play test, hadn't it?

1664
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the reaction must have been really bad.

1665
02:07:57,703 --> 02:08:08,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're saying that economic downturn due to inflation and because of COVID-19 in response, a lower profitability in the European region.

1666
02:08:08,613 --> 02:08:16,280
[SPEAKER_01]: We have reviewed our title portfolio of each of these development base in Europe and resulting actions was cancel hangings.

1667
02:08:17,788 --> 02:08:23,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how far do we have to get from COVID-19 before we can stop blaming COVID-19 for some of this?

1668
02:08:23,971 --> 02:08:28,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, I mean, technically, if you think about it, a game like that could have been developed for a few years.

1669
02:08:28,914 --> 02:08:30,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would have been during the pandemic.

1670
02:08:30,795 --> 02:08:37,058
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, we're kind of getting out of like, away from 2020 a bit.

1671
02:08:37,058 --> 02:08:41,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it that the pandemic happened for a few years, but like, I don't know.

1672
02:08:41,781 --> 02:08:46,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm kind of ready to stop blaming COVID and just start blaming like,

1673
02:08:47,292 --> 02:08:50,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we done didn't plan that correctly.

1674
02:08:50,114 --> 02:08:55,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, our leadership just they just made some dumb decisions, you know.

1675
02:08:55,998 --> 02:08:57,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think it's profitable.

1676
02:08:57,759 --> 02:09:02,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Quest Buster in our chat points out Creative Assembly was about to release Total War Pharaoh later this month, too.

1677
02:09:02,802 --> 02:09:04,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

1678
02:09:04,884 --> 02:09:05,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Bummer.

1679
02:09:05,224 --> 02:09:05,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I.

1680
02:09:07,815 --> 02:09:13,278
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last story I have on the show tonight, this is one of those things where it's like, this is just so wild, I had to bring it up.

1681
02:09:13,278 --> 02:09:23,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not directly about video games, but it lives on a parallel line with DarkSakura doing her little twist of classic non-video game of the month.

1682
02:09:23,125 --> 02:09:29,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of those non-video games I think would be very easy to pick if she didn't already, I don't have a list in front of me, but I don't think she did Pictionary yet.

1683
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:32,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And this last story is about Pictionary.

1684
02:09:32,532 --> 02:09:36,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you all know Pictionary, the legendary board game where you're drawing things.

1685
02:09:36,577 --> 02:09:38,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like win, lose, or draw as a board game, right?

1686
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:41,003
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to draw things people guess, right?

1687
02:09:41,003 --> 02:09:44,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about this new version of Pictionary?

1688
02:09:44,307 --> 02:09:47,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Mattel announces Pictionary AI.

1689
02:09:49,814 --> 02:09:51,435
[SPEAKER_02]: No, let's just marinate on that for a sec.

1690
02:09:51,435 --> 02:09:55,236
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, here's the guess what I tried to create.

1691
02:09:55,236 --> 02:09:56,516
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but here's the wild thing.

1692
02:09:56,516 --> 02:10:05,359
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say Pictionary AI, your brains probably all go to a specific place of like, oh, it's going to try to draw things that you get.

1693
02:10:05,359 --> 02:10:07,580
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually not what it is.

1694
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:10,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually the literal opposite of that.

1695
02:10:10,241 --> 02:10:15,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me explain what Pictionary AI is or as Pictionary versus AI specifically.

1696
02:10:15,838 --> 02:10:20,044
[SPEAKER_02]: What it's doing is it's incorporating AI technology.

1697
02:10:20,044 --> 02:10:21,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a video game.

1698
02:10:21,992 --> 02:10:28,437
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's an analog board game with an app, an AI enhanced refresh is what they're calling it.

1699
02:10:28,437 --> 02:10:33,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens, you are trying to stump artificial intelligence.

1700
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:40,025
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a clue from a card, and you draw on the included whiteboard, just like in the regular game.

1701
02:10:40,025 --> 02:10:47,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the drawing is sent to a smartphone, where it is analyzed by the AI and the algorithm attempts to guess what you drew.

1702
02:10:48,515 --> 02:11:04,615
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone else tries to guess is the AI gonna get it or not and then you make your predictions after seeing the drawings and of course Mattel is saying that's gonna lead to hilarious fun and laughter are sure to ensure with all drawings good and bad

1703
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:19,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to contribute to any AI learning about other art and stealing it, nor how to analyze it for basically, I'm not going to pay to contribute to another system's machine learning.

1704
02:11:19,116 --> 02:11:21,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think anyone should buy this game, quite frankly.

1705
02:11:21,637 --> 02:11:24,898
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is this is where these things are going.

1706
02:11:24,898 --> 02:11:34,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And what actually I have to admit, what shocked me about this was I was going, oh, God, you know, this is it's it's not technically a board game, but they're still they're going to charge people 50 bucks for it.

1707
02:11:34,642 --> 02:11:42,489
[SPEAKER_02]: What is interesting, it's only 25 bucks, which for as much as they're touting all this cutting edge technology stuff seems kind of cheap.

1708
02:11:42,489 --> 02:11:49,275
[SPEAKER_02]: But DarkSakura, I think you I think you just said the more dark sided part of this.

1709
02:11:49,275 --> 02:11:50,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1710
02:11:50,316 --> 02:11:52,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's cheap.

1711
02:11:52,098 --> 02:11:52,678
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this thing?

1712
02:11:52,678 --> 02:11:54,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing is free.

1713
02:11:54,340 --> 02:12:00,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You're either you're paying for something in one way or another, whether it's that whether it's time.

1714
02:12:00,923 --> 02:12:05,364
[SPEAKER_02]: the price of the meta quest going up after they severed the Facebook connection and that whole thing.

1715
02:12:05,364 --> 02:12:15,227
[SPEAKER_02]: $25 will get you four whiteboards, a smartphone stand, a game board, game pieces, some pens, and a stack of clue cards.

1716
02:12:15,227 --> 02:12:16,968
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, y'all?

1717
02:12:16,968 --> 02:12:19,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just go on the internet.

1718
02:12:19,129 --> 02:12:21,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Look up some Pictionary clues.

1719
02:12:21,009 --> 02:12:27,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, you know what you could even if you really wanted to, you could go to chat GPT and say give me some good Pictionary prompts.

1720
02:12:27,171 --> 02:12:29,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could get some pen and paper and play this game with your friends.

1721
02:12:30,805 --> 02:12:51,093
[SPEAKER_02]: no no further AI needed pretty much that I don't know I don't know why this just struck me is so shocking like it is and it isn't like you know people trying to leverage AI in weird ass fucking ways that isn't surprising to me but it's just like pictionary a board game

1722
02:12:52,395 --> 02:12:55,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the, it doesn't even sound set up the right way.

1723
02:12:55,176 --> 02:13:02,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would have thought, oh, it's like, you know, go back to something like anticipation, if you will, where it would draw the clue.

1724
02:13:02,178 --> 02:13:03,098
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually legit.

1725
02:13:03,098 --> 02:13:06,599
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite NES games, Anticipation, where it would draw the clue, right?

1726
02:13:06,599 --> 02:13:09,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you buzz in, but it wasn't AI that powered that.

1727
02:13:09,019 --> 02:13:15,661
[SPEAKER_02]: All those drawings were scripted, you know, and you play the game enough and you can guess things based on the first couple of lines that are drawn.

1728
02:13:15,661 --> 02:13:18,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why nobody wanted to play that game with me at a certain point.

1729
02:13:18,582 --> 02:13:24,744
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, I, I would have thought Pictionary AI meant the game is drawing it.

1730
02:13:24,744 --> 02:13:28,805
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't, when I first read this story, I didn't.

1731
02:13:28,805 --> 02:13:31,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it was that way, it'd still be contributing to things we don't want to support.

1732
02:13:31,946 --> 02:13:37,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I, I know, but I didn't even think about that darker element of it until I'm reading it here.

1733
02:13:37,247 --> 02:13:42,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said that about, well, they're doing it this way because now you're going to be teaching the AI for future versions of the game.

1734
02:13:42,589 --> 02:13:46,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just, wow.

1735
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:46,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1736
02:13:46,895 --> 02:13:50,017
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have you train our AI and you're going to pay for it.

1737
02:13:50,017 --> 02:13:52,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Win, win, win, win.

1738
02:13:52,178 --> 02:13:56,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Think, think about, think about what you buy for the laughs.

1739
02:13:56,861 --> 02:13:58,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1740
02:13:58,902 --> 02:13:59,342
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1741
02:13:59,342 --> 02:14:03,064
[SPEAKER_02]: On that scary note, let's go to, wow, it is spooky season, isn't it?

1742
02:14:03,064 --> 02:14:05,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Halloween.

1743
02:14:05,526 --> 02:14:07,727
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's, let's, let's go.

1744
02:14:07,727 --> 02:14:12,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Who needs serial killers when you have, you know, then again, I mean,

1745
02:14:13,793 --> 02:14:17,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching Alien earlier.

1746
02:14:17,714 --> 02:14:18,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, of course you were.

1747
02:14:18,914 --> 02:14:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother.

1748
02:14:20,935 --> 02:14:31,817
[SPEAKER_02]: An SSJ100 Matt, by the way, is saying that I am pronouncing the, of course, I'm pronouncing word wrong, words wrong yet again here on Originals Radio, that I am pronouncing the name of that game on the NES incorrectly.

1749
02:14:31,817 --> 02:14:40,619
[SPEAKER_02]: The correct way to pronounce the drawing game with the ice cream cone and the high heel as tokens on the game board is Antissa.

1750
02:14:40,619 --> 02:14:41,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Patience.

1751
02:14:41,819 --> 02:14:42,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Say it.

1752
02:14:44,346 --> 02:14:50,589
[SPEAKER_02]: because after all it is Halloween and spooky season officially.

1753
02:14:50,589 --> 02:14:53,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you all get out your Tim Curry memes today?

1754
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:56,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you all get out your Tim Curry memes because it is October 1st?

1755
02:14:56,371 --> 02:14:59,313
[SPEAKER_02]: My entire life is a Tim Curry meme, Rob.

1756
02:14:59,313 --> 02:15:05,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, but it is, it is, you know, it's the day for the Tim Curry meme where it is September 30th.

1757
02:15:05,816 --> 02:15:06,356
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1758
02:15:06,356 --> 02:15:08,818
[SPEAKER_02]: You're that Tim Curry, Wadsworth from Clue, but October 1st.

1759
02:15:10,517 --> 02:15:11,277
[SPEAKER_02]: You're Frank.

1760
02:15:11,277 --> 02:15:12,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You're Frank Inverter.

1761
02:15:12,798 --> 02:15:14,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's spooky season.

1762
02:15:14,638 --> 02:15:16,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're Satan.

1763
02:15:16,119 --> 02:15:16,659
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1764
02:15:16,659 --> 02:15:18,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're Pennywise.

1765
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:22,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you're the Grand Witch.

1766
02:15:22,561 --> 02:15:27,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything can happen on Halloween.

1767
02:15:27,842 --> 02:15:28,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1768
02:15:32,650 --> 02:15:34,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, where the hell do I go with this show?

1769
02:15:34,191 --> 02:15:34,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

1770
02:15:34,611 --> 02:15:35,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a butler.

1771
02:15:35,872 --> 02:15:36,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I buttle.

1772
02:15:36,893 --> 02:15:41,635
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do not, do not devolve this show into quoting the movie Clue.

1773
02:15:41,635 --> 02:15:45,137
[SPEAKER_02]: It will go on for another 90 minutes because I will quote the entire movie.

1774
02:15:51,642 --> 02:15:56,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, uh, you can call in if you want, uh, vognetwork.com slash discord.

1775
02:15:56,883 --> 02:16:02,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also take your questions in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

1776
02:16:02,225 --> 02:16:12,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we'll take your clue quotes too, or, uh, we'll take your emails, except I don't think we got any, uh, at participate at orange lounge radio.com and QuestBusters.

1777
02:16:12,668 --> 02:16:14,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I quote another movie?

1778
02:16:14,188 --> 02:16:14,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1779
02:16:15,087 --> 02:16:16,689
[SPEAKER_03]: We ain't got shit.

1780
02:16:16,689 --> 02:16:17,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1781
02:16:17,089 --> 02:16:18,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll paraphrase.

1782
02:16:18,650 --> 02:16:26,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Sacramento born, I think, Sacramento raised anyway, Tim Russ, who went on to play Tupac, the guy that can't find shit in the desert.

1783
02:16:26,857 --> 02:16:34,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I and you I feel like he gets comments on both equally.

1784
02:16:34,004 --> 02:16:42,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people love him as Tupac, some people love him as the guy in Spaceballs that can't find shit.

1785
02:16:42,151 --> 02:16:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do we have any last minute news?

1786
02:16:44,852 --> 02:16:46,533
[SPEAKER_01]: He don't.

1787
02:16:46,533 --> 02:16:48,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he don't.

1788
02:16:48,055 --> 02:16:48,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked.

1789
02:16:48,635 --> 02:16:50,016
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfortunate.

1790
02:16:50,016 --> 02:16:53,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma's trying to say that he sent a last minute email.

1791
02:16:53,639 --> 02:16:54,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I already closed the email.

1792
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:55,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1793
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't seen it come through because they all get forwarded to my personal box.

1794
02:16:58,203 --> 02:16:59,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen it yet.

1795
02:16:59,484 --> 02:17:01,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it go to spam?

1796
02:17:01,105 --> 02:17:04,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't I don't do any forwarding.

1797
02:17:04,367 --> 02:17:06,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I just go right to the email.

1798
02:17:06,009 --> 02:17:08,851
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I. And no, there's nothing.

1799
02:17:08,851 --> 02:17:10,372
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1800
02:17:10,372 --> 02:17:10,813
[SPEAKER_01]: In the junk.

1801
02:17:10,813 --> 02:17:13,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I did find something interesting as and I noticed.

1802
02:17:15,061 --> 02:17:16,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.

1803
02:17:16,522 --> 02:17:17,744
[SPEAKER_03]: No, keep going.

1804
02:17:17,744 --> 02:17:27,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was just saying while I was trying to search to see if what what DDR Euromix had on it, because I thought there may have been more Kylie Minogue stuff.

1805
02:17:27,593 --> 02:17:29,615
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the legendary song in that game.

1806
02:17:29,615 --> 02:17:31,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that game was awesome.

1807
02:17:31,737 --> 02:17:34,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that song was awesome in that game.

1808
02:17:34,199 --> 02:17:40,045
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently there was a TV show called Dance Revolution that was based off a DDR that was on TV.

1809
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:41,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

1810
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:43,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember we covered it.

1811
02:17:43,331 --> 02:17:44,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I'm sure we covered it.

1812
02:17:44,951 --> 02:17:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I just completely slipped my mind that that was a thing.

1813
02:17:48,332 --> 02:17:51,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember us covering the porno Dance Dance Fuck.

1814
02:17:51,473 --> 02:17:53,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

1815
02:17:53,654 --> 02:17:55,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we are not.

1816
02:17:55,234 --> 02:17:56,875
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're anything, we are thorough.

1817
02:17:56,875 --> 02:17:58,655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.

1818
02:17:58,655 --> 02:18:01,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember me finally hunting down Final Fuck X?

1819
02:18:01,696 --> 02:18:03,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was it was like it was like a combo.

1820
02:18:03,617 --> 02:18:06,598
[SPEAKER_02]: We did Final Fuck X and we did Dance Dance Fuck.

1821
02:18:06,598 --> 02:18:09,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think there was wasn't there another one?

1822
02:18:09,619 --> 02:18:10,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1823
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:10,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1824
02:18:13,074 --> 02:18:16,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, in Final Fuck X, only the women dress up.

1825
02:18:16,336 --> 02:18:20,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like, it's for five seconds, and then they're not wearing anything anymore.

1826
02:18:20,258 --> 02:18:22,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's... Well, I'm just surprised.

1827
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fanboys fucking cosplayers.

1828
02:18:24,561 --> 02:18:28,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just surprised that that movie, the FC, got a total of four movies.

1829
02:18:28,903 --> 02:18:30,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize there were three sequels to that.

1830
02:18:30,765 --> 02:18:33,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew there was like a couple sequels to it, but four?

1831
02:18:33,146 --> 02:18:35,087
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.

1832
02:18:35,087 --> 02:18:36,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knew?

1833
02:18:36,848 --> 02:18:38,129
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1834
02:18:38,129 --> 02:18:41,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess with that... Oh, we have an email, DarkSakura.

1835
02:18:41,251 --> 02:18:41,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1836
02:18:42,791 --> 02:18:44,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Greetings, everyone.

1837
02:18:44,072 --> 02:18:47,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I am glad there was a brief chat on 25 years of DDR.

1838
02:18:47,055 --> 02:18:52,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping that maybe there would be what would have been a list list for favorite DDR songs.

1839
02:18:52,279 --> 02:18:56,102
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead, I have three questions for everyone, along with my answers.

1840
02:18:56,102 --> 02:18:58,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Five favorite DDR songs.

1841
02:18:58,864 --> 02:19:08,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ranma suggests My Sweet Darling, Tsukaru, Candy, Trust DDR Mix, and Dance Dance Revolution by DDR All Stars.

1842
02:19:10,694 --> 02:19:15,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go with Superstar.

1843
02:19:15,217 --> 02:19:22,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, that was like my warm up song.

1844
02:19:22,922 --> 02:19:34,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Brilliant Tea Orchestra Mix, still one of my favorites to this day.

1845
02:19:34,429 --> 02:19:37,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning Heat, that made it into DDR, right?

1846
02:19:37,131 --> 02:19:38,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it did.

1847
02:19:40,561 --> 02:19:45,682
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um... Also, didn't the other Gradius mix make it in there?

1848
02:19:45,682 --> 02:19:46,783
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it didn't.

1849
02:19:46,783 --> 02:19:48,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just pretty weak.

1850
02:19:48,643 --> 02:19:51,704
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gyruss mix was in there.

1851
02:19:51,704 --> 02:19:52,264
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Xbox.

1852
02:19:52,264 --> 02:19:54,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually really like the Gyruss mix.

1853
02:19:54,965 --> 02:20:01,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um... Uh... My Baby Mama.

1854
02:20:01,146 --> 02:20:02,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha!

1855
02:20:02,406 --> 02:20:09,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Who is My Baby... Yeah, it was My Baby, because... You know there was a parody of a song called My Baby Daddy?

1856
02:20:10,032 --> 02:20:12,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I know.

1857
02:20:12,493 --> 02:20:17,875
[SPEAKER_02]: My five would be, and also I want to point out on the listless thing, a couple issues with the listless thing.

1858
02:20:17,875 --> 02:20:21,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we do this show virtually, we don't really have guests in studio at this point.

1859
02:20:21,277 --> 02:20:23,738
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have that kind of part.

1860
02:20:23,738 --> 02:20:31,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the voting technology that we used to have through vognetwork.com because people can't sign up for VOG Network anymore.

1861
02:20:31,041 --> 02:20:33,842
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't allow new people to vote on answers ultimately.

1862
02:20:33,842 --> 02:20:36,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of faded the listless thing a little bit.

1863
02:20:36,604 --> 02:20:38,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say it's never going to come back.

1864
02:20:38,144 --> 02:20:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: We may do it, you know.

1865
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:43,302
[SPEAKER_03]: but we can have people vote in Twitch.

1866
02:20:43,302 --> 02:20:47,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, don't you have to put a set extension for that?

1867
02:20:47,184 --> 02:20:50,505
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just built in through the control panel.

1868
02:20:50,505 --> 02:20:51,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1869
02:20:51,766 --> 02:20:54,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to look into it because I don't I don't ever run polls on there.

1870
02:20:54,307 --> 02:20:55,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll look into it.

1871
02:20:55,868 --> 02:20:57,129
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't do it right now.

1872
02:20:57,129 --> 02:20:58,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So so later.

1873
02:20:58,749 --> 02:21:01,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, five songs for me that I can do right now.

1874
02:21:01,711 --> 02:21:03,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna go off top of my head.

1875
02:21:03,312 --> 02:21:05,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Nick, please not so quick.

1876
02:21:05,473 --> 02:21:09,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghosts, Skulk.

1877
02:21:09,455 --> 02:21:09,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1878
02:21:12,155 --> 02:21:21,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Alive, the uplifting one because there was two I'm Alive so I'm Alive, I'm Alive, that one and then Together Forever by Captain Jack.

1879
02:21:21,057 --> 02:21:23,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Those would be my five.

1880
02:21:23,858 --> 02:21:24,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki?

1881
02:21:24,198 --> 02:21:27,619
[SPEAKER_01]: If I pick five songs, oh gosh.

1882
02:21:27,619 --> 02:21:30,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would say Look to the Sky.

1883
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:34,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.

1884
02:21:34,161 --> 02:21:39,182
[SPEAKER_01]: God, there's Moving On from Fifth Mix.

1885
02:21:42,683 --> 02:21:44,944
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff I played.

1886
02:21:44,944 --> 02:21:51,765
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a whole bunch of stuff that I played that was, I think, in the home version folder in Xtreme.

1887
02:21:51,765 --> 02:21:52,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, look those guys.

1888
02:21:52,825 --> 02:21:59,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, like, Kind Lady, even... Oh, what else?

1889
02:21:59,647 --> 02:22:01,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind Lady, So in Love.

1890
02:22:01,927 --> 02:22:05,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to like that one quite a bit.

1891
02:22:05,608 --> 02:22:06,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, which was that?

1892
02:22:06,288 --> 02:22:08,429
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the tutorial song that was really catchy?

1893
02:22:10,185 --> 02:22:14,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I also do have to add the Silent Hill.

1894
02:22:14,287 --> 02:22:17,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight is, you know.

1895
02:22:17,448 --> 02:22:20,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, remember the dance mix that was in Extreme US?

1896
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:22,811
[SPEAKER_02]: We debuted that on OLR.

1897
02:22:22,811 --> 02:22:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

1898
02:22:23,151 --> 02:22:27,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I still liked the original one.

1899
02:22:27,613 --> 02:22:31,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it wasn't a mix, I played a lot.

1900
02:22:31,275 --> 02:22:32,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, start to tune out Simple Barber.

1901
02:22:32,756 --> 02:22:33,136
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

1902
02:22:33,136 --> 02:22:34,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1903
02:22:34,156 --> 02:22:36,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Simple Barber.

1904
02:22:36,818 --> 02:22:37,578
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to move it.

1905
02:22:38,064 --> 02:22:40,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that song, but I didn't like any of the cuts.

1906
02:22:40,948 --> 02:22:50,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the one that came on the soundtrack that they gave us for Supernova, but not any of the ones that ended up in the games, unfortunately.

1907
02:22:52,507 --> 02:23:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have enough Xbox because obviously Skulk I always put like the entire song list for DDR Ultimix 2 and 3 were like bangers like I am gothic.

1908
02:23:01,493 --> 02:23:05,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I like there's just there's so many good songs in those mixes that were really overlooked.

1909
02:23:05,095 --> 02:23:05,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sad.

1910
02:23:05,655 --> 02:23:06,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything but MIDI head.

1911
02:23:06,976 --> 02:23:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm so sad.

1912
02:23:07,996 --> 02:23:09,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not backwards compatible.

1913
02:23:09,938 --> 02:23:10,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Bummer.

1914
02:23:10,918 --> 02:23:11,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

1915
02:23:11,719 --> 02:23:12,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to email.

1916
02:23:12,319 --> 02:23:12,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1917
02:23:12,999 --> 02:23:14,540
[SPEAKER_03]: So next question.

1918
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:18,623
[SPEAKER_03]: First difficult song you passed and that for Ranma was Freckles.

1919
02:23:20,595 --> 02:23:21,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan78 was slow.

1920
02:23:43,385 --> 02:23:44,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know what mine was.

1921
02:23:44,446 --> 02:23:46,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It was My Summer Love.

1922
02:23:46,326 --> 02:23:47,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

1923
02:23:47,307 --> 02:23:48,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that one.

1924
02:23:48,187 --> 02:24:08,216
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was it was the slow Orion 78 mix that where the I still remember to this day, the feet pattern was bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bu

1925
02:24:14,297 --> 02:24:16,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1926
02:24:16,538 --> 02:24:18,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, did you answer?

1927
02:24:18,659 --> 02:24:19,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1928
02:24:19,639 --> 02:24:20,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, song.

1929
02:24:20,499 --> 02:24:22,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1930
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:25,561
[SPEAKER_01]: The first nine letter.

1931
02:24:25,561 --> 02:24:26,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.

1932
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:29,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was.

1933
02:24:29,002 --> 02:24:34,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was like the original Paranoia.

1934
02:24:34,744 --> 02:24:40,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think the original was only an eight, but it's still like maybe it's maybe it's La Senorita.

1935
02:24:40,546 --> 02:24:42,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember is something.

1936
02:24:43,717 --> 02:24:44,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynamite Rave

1937
02:25:14,945 --> 02:25:20,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So one song you heard on the radio or streaming that you want to see in DDR.

1938
02:25:20,947 --> 02:25:26,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's Tower of Flower, the ending theme from like, like Chorus Recoil.

1939
02:25:26,688 --> 02:25:33,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this answer because I just said something about this earlier, too.

1940
02:25:33,150 --> 02:25:39,391
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be Vibrancy from Violet.

1941
02:25:39,391 --> 02:25:40,952
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a fantastic

1942
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:44,761
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the genre?

1943
02:25:44,761 --> 02:25:48,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Horror synth, dark synth, synth metal producer.

1944
02:25:48,924 --> 02:25:50,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1945
02:25:50,485 --> 02:25:51,585
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very DDR song.

1946
02:25:51,585 --> 02:25:53,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Look it up on Spotify.

1947
02:25:53,987 --> 02:25:57,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just default to Kylie and say Say Something.

1948
02:25:57,429 --> 02:25:58,950
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite Kylie song.

1949
02:25:58,950 --> 02:26:07,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably, actually, I really kind of want to dance to this, and that would be Pink Venom by Blackpink.

1950
02:26:07,115 --> 02:26:10,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I don't know, I'm just down for that, or The Girls by Blackpink.

1951
02:26:12,028 --> 02:26:12,588
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1952
02:26:12,588 --> 02:26:23,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's sacrilegious to change my answer away from Kylie, but I'm going to because I just feel like if we're gonna go cheese, let's go full on cheese and let's get Gaga in DDR already.

1953
02:26:23,156 --> 02:26:24,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just go.

1954
02:26:24,097 --> 02:26:25,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just go right for it.

1955
02:26:25,057 --> 02:26:27,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get Bad Romance in DDR.

1956
02:26:27,099 --> 02:26:32,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought Gaga was in DDR already.

1957
02:26:32,323 --> 02:26:33,944
[SPEAKER_03]: In rock band.

1958
02:26:33,944 --> 02:26:36,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't followed the series in a long time.

1959
02:26:36,145 --> 02:26:39,568
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm pretty sure she's in DDR because I want to say

1960
02:26:41,288 --> 02:26:46,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides that, you know what I think would be a better song than Bad Romance to dance to?

1961
02:26:46,849 --> 02:26:49,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It would actually be Shiza.

1962
02:26:49,070 --> 02:26:49,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good song.

1963
02:26:49,890 --> 02:26:55,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you might say Dance in the Dark, which is a great song that was never a single.

1964
02:26:55,311 --> 02:26:58,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Shiza's my angry driving music.

1965
02:26:58,752 --> 02:27:01,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DJRamaS says Bad Romance was in DDR for 360.

1966
02:27:01,432 --> 02:27:02,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shut me up.

1967
02:27:02,152 --> 02:27:03,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot about that one.

1968
02:27:03,033 --> 02:27:06,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that Bad Romance would be too slow.

1969
02:27:06,053 --> 02:27:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's like one of the quintessential Gaga songs, you know?

1970
02:27:08,814 --> 02:27:09,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1971
02:27:09,234 --> 02:27:09,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1972
02:27:09,885 --> 02:27:11,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, I'll go back to my original Kylie answer.

1973
02:27:11,506 --> 02:27:12,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have never left you, Kylie.

1974
02:27:12,426 --> 02:27:15,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Born This Way would probably be.

1975
02:27:15,188 --> 02:27:15,668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1976
02:27:15,668 --> 02:27:23,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, if I had a Kylie song, though, I would want to do I Love It.

1977
02:27:23,612 --> 02:27:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I can also see the actual song Dancing by Kylie.

1978
02:27:25,754 --> 02:27:26,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a great.

1979
02:27:27,329 --> 02:27:27,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1980
02:27:27,829 --> 02:27:28,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, anyway.

1981
02:27:28,890 --> 02:27:32,071
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so the email ends.

1982
02:27:32,071 --> 02:27:33,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for reading my email.

1983
02:27:33,051 --> 02:27:34,691
[SPEAKER_03]: See you on the flip side.

1984
02:27:34,691 --> 02:27:41,054
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S. Thanks for the memories, DJ Ranma S. Which is not a song I said I would want to see in DDR, but I guess I could.

1985
02:27:41,054 --> 02:27:45,755
[SPEAKER_03]: How about thanks for the memories, because it's Halloween-y.

1986
02:27:45,755 --> 02:27:46,195
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1987
02:27:46,195 --> 02:27:48,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want to send us- Oh, you know what needs to be in DDR?

1988
02:27:48,496 --> 02:27:49,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1989
02:27:49,896 --> 02:27:52,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiscal and Devil Doll.

1990
02:27:52,757 --> 02:27:54,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the Radiscal.

1991
02:27:55,495 --> 02:27:56,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Megalovania, Homestuck

1992
02:28:17,834 --> 02:28:19,276
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1993
02:28:19,276 --> 02:28:21,678
[SPEAKER_02]: With all that, we're gonna wrap up the show.

1994
02:28:21,678 --> 02:28:25,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we would love to hear your DDR memories for next week if you want to send us an email.

1995
02:28:25,402 --> 02:28:30,067
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for a reason to send us an email, I think some DDR memory lane stuff would be a great one.

1996
02:28:30,067 --> 02:28:35,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to give us five songs, maybe give us like your one song that just makes you really happy from the DDR perspective.

1997
02:28:36,695 --> 02:28:40,459
[SPEAKER_02]: But with all of that, we are going to start to wrap up the show.

1998
02:28:40,459 --> 02:28:44,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody for listening to Orange Launch Radio and participating with the show tonight.

1999
02:28:44,443 --> 02:28:47,286
[SPEAKER_02]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two.

2000
02:28:47,286 --> 02:28:52,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, you know, we don't always have the voices to put out here on air.

2001
02:28:53,272 --> 02:28:54,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell a friend or two, help us spread the word.

2002
02:28:54,994 --> 02:29:00,180
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice 5-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify, which I think finally has a ranking for us.

2003
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:03,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough of you have ranked us as Spotify, so thank you.

2004
02:29:03,103 --> 02:29:03,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that.

2005
02:29:03,864 --> 02:29:07,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And 5-star reviews there go a long way, so thank you for all of that.

2006
02:29:07,347 --> 02:29:09,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate that.

2007
02:29:09,249 --> 02:29:11,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, we lost your VTuber, but I think you're still with us?

2008
02:29:13,798 --> 02:29:14,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

2009
02:29:14,318 --> 02:29:19,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went ahead and started switching over so I could, you know, go to the bathroom.

2010
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:19,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fair enough.

2011
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:22,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have a final thought for us tonight?

2012
02:29:22,221 --> 02:29:25,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know you're going to do your streaming and thing, which we haven't seen you in a couple of weeks.

2013
02:29:25,742 --> 02:29:27,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see you.

2014
02:29:27,683 --> 02:29:29,104
[SPEAKER_03]: See you tonight.

2015
02:29:29,104 --> 02:29:32,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I may be playing with some friends.

2016
02:29:32,185 --> 02:29:38,827
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I said, I'm in my new nurse era, but I'm going to be playing with a couple of friends that I don't often get to play with.

2017
02:29:38,827 --> 02:29:39,987
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be happy.

2018
02:29:39,987 --> 02:29:40,548
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2019
02:29:40,548 --> 02:29:41,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun.

2020
02:29:41,088 --> 02:29:41,688
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you in a minute.

2021
02:29:42,803 --> 02:29:45,665
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have fun swimming the castle.

2022
02:29:45,665 --> 02:29:47,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it'll work?

2023
02:29:47,567 --> 02:29:48,768
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll take a miracle.

2024
02:29:48,768 --> 02:29:49,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2025
02:29:49,869 --> 02:29:51,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2026
02:29:51,430 --> 02:29:56,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I always forget it's Carol Kane that played that part, too, who is amazing, by the way.

2027
02:29:56,314 --> 02:29:58,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's go to Loki.

2028
02:29:58,276 --> 02:30:00,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is my camera bigger in this shot?

2029
02:30:00,138 --> 02:30:03,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear I'm going to just nuke all these OLR shots and make new ones.

2030
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:05,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get a makeover in a few weeks.

2031
02:30:05,122 --> 02:30:08,625
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2032
02:30:08,625 --> 02:30:10,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go back to work.

2033
02:30:10,867 --> 02:30:11,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Mood.

2034
02:30:11,910 --> 02:30:20,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my final thought for tonight is, uh, I'm going to continue Pokemon, uh, Scarlet on my personal channel with Shane, Pokemon Gen 9 on Monday.

2035
02:30:20,616 --> 02:30:27,921
[SPEAKER_02]: We did our first, uh, we did kind of like an hour and a half that's on my YouTube channel, because you have to kind of get to a certain point before you can play multiplayer.

2036
02:30:27,921 --> 02:30:37,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're playing multiplayer and we, we, we didn't even get to like the first gym or anything, but because it's open world, we were running around catching so much.

2037
02:30:37,508 --> 02:30:38,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So like,

2038
02:30:38,969 --> 02:30:45,235
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a good, like, three-hour stream on Monday and got the decks to probably, like, 30 Pokemon, if not more.

2039
02:30:45,235 --> 02:30:47,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're just catching different Pokemon out there in the open world.

2040
02:30:47,877 --> 02:30:52,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then, you know, we'll go probably tomorrow to take on the first gym or something.

2041
02:30:52,321 --> 02:30:54,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what order we're going to do things, but we'll figure it out.

2042
02:30:54,422 --> 02:30:57,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will be on my personal channel over at Rob Roberts.

2043
02:30:57,986 --> 02:31:01,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to make sure I also shout out VOG Network on YouTube.

2044
02:31:01,769 --> 02:31:05,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not bring it up tonight otherwise, but we did a video, speaking of Shane,

2045
02:31:05,672 --> 02:31:07,694
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about Monster Hunter now.

2046
02:31:07,694 --> 02:31:10,136
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did that, and we posted that over on YouTube.

2047
02:31:10,136 --> 02:31:11,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So please check that out.

2048
02:31:11,537 --> 02:31:16,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And thumbs up, nice ratings, like, share, comment, subscribe, all that good stuff.

2049
02:31:16,842 --> 02:31:17,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us out.

2050
02:31:17,923 --> 02:31:18,283
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2051
02:31:18,283 --> 02:31:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to do it for another episode of Orange Science Radio.
