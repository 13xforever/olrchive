10358	13340	Founders are typically artists, CEOs are business people.
13340	16122	Founders create products, services, they fulfill needs.
16122	18944	CEOs manipulate money, damn the consequences.
18944	23646	And sometimes they manipulate themselves into being a community pariah, manipulating themselves out of a role.
23646	27909	I don't know what the long tale of Unity's saga will be, but right now it doesn't involve John Riccatello.
27909	29910	One CEO out, another CEO out eventually.
29910	34854	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about their story, and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34854	36995	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice,
39674	42896	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42896	47599	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47599	57704	It is Orange Lounge Radio back one more time with episode number 978 of our program for tonight, October the 15th of 2023.
57704	60986	I say one more time because we're not here next week, but then we'll be back in two weeks.
60986	69051	We'll talk all about that in just a moment, because this also involves not just myself, Rob Roberts, but my co-hosts, including DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70862	71502	Hi.
71502	73823	Hi, how are you?
73823	76765	I'm so busy.
76765	78585	So much going on.
78585	88329	Yeah, and it's only going to get busier because next week there's no Orange Launch Radio because DarkSakura and I are going to be in Vegas at TwitchCon, which is very exciting.
88329	88369	So
90628	96772	Also, Dan was at Pinnagogo in Dixon all weekend.
96772	101395	Yeah, but I don't like to go because I don't like where it is.
101395	102696	And corn.
102696	104037	Well, you know what else was this weekend?
104037	109041	I know this probably isn't up your alley, but it's still a pretty big deal, is the Pokemon Regional Championships.
109041	111423	We're here in Sacramento, where our show is based.
112063	113744	no idea that that was this week.
113744	115305	Well, I knew they were coming.
115305	119528	But like, honestly, when they announced it, I was like, Oh, it must be a 2024 thing.
119528	126592	Like I didn't realize it was like literally this weekend until I was doing Community Day for Pokemon Go at Capitol Park where I usually do.
126592	134077	And I was like, why is there like a cluster of like seven unspun Pokestops all over by the new convention center?
134077	134377	What is it?
134377	135178	I was and then I was like,
136119	140823	Oh, they set up a whole little special area for the regional championships.
140823	151852	Oh, so yeah, so I tried to get gifts out from that to some Pokemon fans that I know such as Shane, I had to text Shane and be like, you need to open your gift right now, please.
151852	155015	And then Mike Deft in our chat, I know would appreciate a gift from there.
155015	158117	So it was kind of fun little virtual souvenirs.
158117	159298	I did not go into
159959	163981	the Pokemon regionals, but I peeked my head in the door to see what it looked like.
163981	169164	And it just looked like these giant tables of nerds playing card games, which is what you'd expect.
169164	173687	So it was good.
173687	176809	Have you been to that new convention center yet, DarkSakura?
176809	179070	Nope.
179070	180011	It's it's nice.
180011	182212	I'll say that.
182212	183813	All right.
183813	185454	Hmm.
185454	188796	I'm, I've been I've been very focused on other things.
188796	189176	I gotcha.
189176	189516	I gotcha.
190222	196646	Well, also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
196646	198067	Hey, Loki, I think you're muted.
198067	198428	Hello.
198428	199108	There you go.
199108	199488	How are you doing?
199488	200509	I thought I pushed the button.
200509	200989	That's all right.
200989	202591	I'm doing all right.
202591	207034	I'm trying to figure out what this looks like a scary game playing behind you tonight that I don't recognize.
207034	208675	But it's like a first person.
208675	210156	Somebody's exploring a pool.
210156	211277	Like, are they going to find a body?
211277	212717	What game is this?
212717	214078	No, it's a liminal game.
214078	218101	So it's called Dream Corps.
218101	219222	Oh, interesting.
220381	224205	It's it's supposed to resemble like the back rooms and stuff.
224205	226006	Oh, okay.
226006	227828	Interesting.
227828	232092	Of course, you can see the games that Loki's playing behind him.
232092	242342	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific at twitch.tv slash VOG Network Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwell show again, that's VOG Network.
242682	269867	but of course we are a podcast as well and you can listen to us anyway wherever podcasts are found such as Spotify or iTunes or well not Google Podcasts for much longer as I understand it because Google Podcasts apparently is closing up shop and or they're folding it into YouTube or something like that so there's not going to be that much longer but there's a lot of podcast apps out there and you can find us in pretty much all of them I think at this point because the one I didn't like
270607	272029	shut their doors.
272029	273872	So I don't have to worry about that anymore.
273872	277097	I don't have to say we're not on.
277097	278820	But that's not a problem anymore.
278820	279361	They're gone.
279361	281825	So you know, it is what it is.
281825	282065	All right.
283561	288522	Anyhow, and I just got tagged with that in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
288522	293023	Mike Def talking about the regionals going I know I knew and I wished I could have gone.
293023	297924	It was VGC trading card game and go they have all that.
297924	304245	And let's see Fifth Dream says they have regionals in the next town over from me, which is odd because it's such a nowhere area.
304245	306326	But I'm surprised every time I hear they're here.
306326	310927	Hey, maybe there's a lot of players in that area or just you know, wherever they can get the convention center cheap.
312068	323629	And sjo100mat points out the Google Graveyard site continues to grow with the website killedbygoogle.com, which I'm sure probably has pages and pages to say about Google Stadia RIP.
324817	330382	Anyway, let's get into the gaming news of the week starting off with our big big news.
330382	337147	This is really a follow up story to something we've talked about every damn week on this show for the last 16 months.
337147	339749	And this might finally be the last time we talk about it.
339749	340490	Just kidding.
340490	345554	It's still gonna have ramifications for weeks and weeks but big milestone this week.
345554	347515	Loki, what's going on?
347515	349337	The Activision Blizzard deal finally
350208	351489	has finished.
351489	356132	So Microsoft has finished their acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
356132	358353	It's done.
358353	359074	That's it.
359074	360014	That's the news.
360014	360434	That's it.
360434	361375	That's the news.
361375	364177	So they closed what on Friday the 13th?
364177	370000	Well, that that's a, you know, on this data, you know, start your new business, but all right.
370000	373563	Well, they probably had to close the deal because wasn't the federal
374483	377065	DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
404463	410345	One particular individual whose time I've been hoping would be running out this entire time.
410345	411485	A little bit more time.
411485	414586	Loki, what is Bobby Kotick's future in this?
414586	424470	Bobby Kotick is staying on for the next two months to help aid in the transition, but then he'll be out as of January 1st.
425655	427698	Damn shame it's not a swift kick in the nuts.
427698	428519	It is a damn shame.
428519	430382	It's not a swift kick in the nuts or the butt.
430382	431623	I'll take either.
431623	435548	But he's also only gonna end up with like, you know, $400 million or something.
435548	440275	That's and that's the really depressing part is this huge golden parachute.
440275	441637	We knew it was gonna happen.
441637	442538	We knew it was gonna happen.
444279	449700	There are some interesting comments on there too, but most of the comments are pretty positive about him going.
449700	450281	Of course.
450281	459623	You know, but there's a few also saying that, like, his staying was, like, some contractual thing.
459623	470325	And, but I mean, like, to keep him around for loyalty purposes, when it's his fault their stock took the drop that began the process to begin with?
470325	472266	Yes.
472266	472626	I mean,
474046	479148	That's some some dump level of delusion there.
479148	479468	Yeah.
479468	482470	And like, look, I'm not pleased with the golden parachute news.
482470	484531	I the date thing is kind of a whatever.
484531	486451	That's a small price to pay to get rid of him.
486451	486952	No, I know.
486952	487252	I know.
487252	498417	But and the date thing is, I mean, it's a it's a very clean cut off date of sorts, I'm sure for financial reasons and transition reasons, like the first of the year is a very ceremonial type of day.
498417	499857	So like, I get it.
499857	501078	Is it soon enough?
501078	501318	No.
501718	511663	But now now do I now can I make one of those calendars with the little tear off pages that says days until Bobby Kotick is no longer poison in this industry?
511663	514144	Yes, I can now have that calendar.
514144	517546	We can make a counter for it on.
517546	522328	I hear Unity's looking for a new seed.
522328	522988	Stop it.
522988	523749	Shut up.
523749	524049	Shut up.
527185	534352	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, to be very honest, having him there for two more months does allow things to be transitioned cleanly.
534352	538416	They couldn't really talk to each other until the deal was finalized, the quiet period.
540425	555899	Unfortunately, the reality of this situation, as happy as we are to see Microsoft, in the long run, see Microsoft acquire Activision Blizzard, and to be clear, and I feel like I've made this very clear in prior episodes of the show, but before somebody takes me out of context,
556658	559860	I do not love the bigger fish eating the big fish.
559860	562342	This is not something I love about this industry.
562342	584718	This particular circumstance, because specifically of Bobby Kotick and the toxins that he has put in this industry, I am highly supportive of this merger because as now we see with our tearaway calendar, only what, 75 more days or whatever it is until Bobby Kotick is no longer poisoning this industry, I support this merger because the end of the day, the punchline is Bobby Kotick's out.
585418	589200	The part that's going to suck about this, there's going to be redundancies.
589200	591501	And there's going to be people that end up laid off.
591501	593421	And that sucks.
593421	598884	I would assume it's things where we talk more about publicity.
598884	606427	And that's I mean, I don't know, I don't run a company, but I would I could see that there are probably going to be some some over steps there.
606427	611729	And obviously, we already know on the Blizzard front, the eSports stuff really took a hit.
611729	614530	So, you know, a lot of that has already been kind of on its way out.
614730	615230	Thanks for watching!
628965	634046	Uh, Microsoft has already, like, they had to come out the very first day to talk about Game Pass, didn't they?
634046	638247	Because that's the question everybody's been asking.
638247	644688	Uh, and I believe the, uh, too long didn't read of that was they're saying, don't expect anything right now.
644688	646608	And I thought this was interesting.
646608	651969	They said, don't expect Call of Duty or Diablo 4 this year.
651969	657670	And they named those two games specifically, but I thought it was interesting that they didn't name anything else.
659031	662442	Well they probably have agreements maybe with other...
663613	664714	Services or something.
664714	665375	I don't know.
665375	667737	Well, I think it's also the newness of those games.
667737	672621	And, you know, just because there is still a transition period, you know, again, Bobby staying on till the end of the year.
672621	681108	So there's probably, you know, there's probably in some ways they're still going to run like separate companies a little bit, you know, as we get closer to the end of the year, you know, and so they don't want to.
681108	682349	There's a branding switch to happen.
682349	682609	Yeah.
682609	687153	And there's they don't want to disrupt the holiday season with two of the biggest launches for Activision Blizzard this year.
687153	688174	So like it all.
688174	688735	I get it.
688735	691577	Like, I think it would have been a little bit creepy.
691770	692310	James Corden
705885	717230	Bobby also points out in our chat, the good Bobby, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat points out something very interesting as well saying the other interesting part is that the Activision games that are on Game Pass will not be part of the streaming.
717230	719231	Ubisoft has the exclusive streaming rights.
719231	726674	That is very interesting because, you know, as we know, they had to give those streaming rights over to Ubisoft in Europe anyway.
727387	728048	Xcloud Streaming Rights
744228	746889	But I'm still curious about some of the back catalog games.
746889	750731	You know, there still is a very rich back catalog of games.
750731	756875	Diablo 2 Remastered, Diablo 3 Ultimate Edition, some of the older Call of Duty games, Crash Bandicoot.
756875	760216	You know, there's a lot of other games that would make sense.
760216	763198	And actually, there's already some good stuff on Game Pass.
763198	772063	If you weren't already aware, because I did this, you can unlock all of the new heroes in Overwatch 2, all of them from all these passes through Game Pass.
772663	776145	you have to do it on your Xbox version of the game.
776145	780568	But once you do that, it syncs up to the cloud and all that good stuff.
780568	783489	And then they unlock on your PC version as well.
783489	785971	So and I imagine you won't have to do that forever.
785971	789993	Like that that will be something that probably comes together as a result of all of this.
789993	793775	So you already can get some kind of good deal there.
793775	795576	So interesting.
795576	797017	Bobby is saying it's worldwide.
798483	804565	I swear the Ubisoft thing was just Europe, but maybe it has a trickle-down effect with some of the streaming deals.
804565	815830	I'd have to look more into that, because obviously there's a lot that we're going to see settling down over the next few weeks with where does this land, but I would be surprised.
816851	827514	if Microsoft doesn't push a few titles to Game Pass over the holiday season to really push Game Pass sales over the holiday season and entice people to keep Game Pass.
827514	836137	No, it's not going to be Diablo 4, the newest Call of Duty game, but there's still a rich back catalog of other stuff they could put on there that could be very, very interesting.
836137	839438	So we shall see what becomes of all that.
840717	841658	So stay tuned.
841658	848341	That's why I say even though this is like done, it's not like done, done.
848341	853504	Bobby Blackelven Chat points out they'll have titles on Game Pass, but for download only.
853504	856386	So yeah, I mean, you can still do it that way, of course.
856386	858847	It's just the streaming element is going to be impacted there.
860896	861396	Yeah, okay.
861396	866878	And Questbuster brought the receipts and shows that, yeah, they have worldwide cloud streaming rights for the next 15 years.
866878	871279	That's, I really did think that was just Europe that they gave that over, not the whole world.
871279	872019	That's wild.
872019	874460	But there's the receipts, an article there that talks about it.
874460	887544	For the next 15 years, Microsoft is relinquishing cloud streaming rights for all Activision games outside the European Economic Area, EEA, a region that constitutes the 27 EU members plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.
887924	899412	This means that French game publisher Ubisoft is also a big winner, as it will have exclusive global streaming rights outside the EEA, while inside the EEA it will share streaming rights with rivals, including Microsoft Activision.
899412	905115	That was a very interesting way to do it, to win over Europe, but I guess that's how they did it.
905115	906336	Wow.
906336	906837	Fascinating.
909074	916739	It's still going to be on Game Pass, maybe just not, you know, via like the X Cloud or whatever.
916739	925225	It's literally that, Xbox.com, which you could still do because I've done this with Overwatch 2 because of specifically what I just talked about.
925225	927207	I was able to do this without leaving my chair.
927207	932811	What you can do is you can stream your Xbox Series X downstairs
933411	938616	to your PC upstairs so you can play the game on there if you really want.
938616	942780	Although, I don't know why you would just want to play it on your PC, but everybody has their reasons.
942780	949226	Well, maybe DarkSakura might have a compelling reason with a Mac OS.
949226	956033	I know you're not really an Xbox ecosystem person, but if you were, hypothetically, you could stream from your Xbox Series X in one room to your Mac.
956793	959536	Um, you know, so at least I think so.
959536	961237	At least I think you can't do the website.
961237	965782	They've got to have some type of standalone client, uh, somewhere, but I know you can do it on PC for sure.
965782	967443	It's obviously, it's all built into Windows 11.
967443	970126	It's very, very easy, um, to do it there.
970126	975451	So, um, that you can do, because I did that.
975451	976311	So.
976311	980795	I, I, I removed parallels from my system, so that wouldn't even work for me anyway.
980795	982157	Ah, gotcha.
982157	982357	All right.
982625	983606	Yeah.
983606	985467	Well, anyway, we'll see what continues.
985467	987308	I will not taint my Mac.
987308	988329	Oh, stop.
988329	989430	All right.
989430	994313	If I could if I could dual boot my current computer with Mac OS, why wouldn't I?
994313	996734	Well, yeah, but two are better than one.
996734	1001738	The Silicon won't support a dual boot for a different OS.
1001738	1002398	I know, I know.
1002398	1005340	Anyway, that's why I say if, if, if.
1005340	1007101	OK.
1007101	1008542	Anyway.
1008542	1009743	Actually, though, Rob,
1010668	1024324	You know what though, I mentioned it before, I was looking into all this stuff about the game porting kit and perhaps something like that would make things work.
1027935	1040285	SheHulk10 says Xbox Game Pass is going to blossom, probably creating a lot of stress for people that have a huge backlog of games to play and not completed, like showing up to a smorgasbord and not hungry.
1040285	1044329	I get where that comment comes from, to be fair though, Game Pass is already like that.
1045835	1053440	But yes, adding 20 Activision games by the end of the year, if they go that way, is only going to make the problem worse.
1053440	1054941	Yes, that I will agree.
1054941	1061545	Because I could see games I would actually like to play that I never got around to, like Crash Bandicoot Team Racing, Crash Bandicoot 4.
1061545	1068749	Those are very likely candidates to end up in that kind of thing, that would end up this holiday season, because they're from a few years ago.
1068749	1071171	So yeah, it's going to make that problem worse.
1071171	1072832	So that part, yeah, I totally get that.
1073285	1077008	But come January, I can play World of Warcraft with a clean conscience.
1077008	1077969	Yep.
1077969	1078990	All right.
1078990	1080211	Well, let's let's move.
1080211	1086656	I mean, I saw I'm playing it now, and I sort of feel that there's a lot of toxicity everywhere in the game industry.
1086656	1087617	But I digress.
1087617	1089298	That's another topic for another day.
1089298	1090139	All right.
1090139	1096424	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1096424	1098545	Whatever publisher may have made the games.
1098545	1099666	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1099666	1100347	How was your gaming week?
1101422	1105330	It was alright, um, I played some pinball, um...
1108016	1111058	I played some Dead by Daylight a little bit.
1111058	1113560	I'm supposed to have Fringlish playing with me tonight.
1113560	1116723	It's been a while since we played together.
1116723	1125669	Because I've already beaten Live Alive, I just played some Dreamlight Valley last night, just, you know, to do stuff.
1125669	1134616	And after TwitchCon, I'll be starting the SNES edition of Magic Knight Rayearth, or Super Famicom.
1135977	1140259	So that'll be fun.
1140259	1148143	I played through... I played some Devil's Crush and Jackie Crush and...
1150328	1155571	I forgot how much I suck at Area 88, or as we got it, UN Squadron.
1155571	1158853	Is Sea of Stars like Sea of Thieves?
1158853	1160393	Because I'm totally not into Sea of Thieves.
1160393	1160954	No, no, no, no.
1160954	1162635	Sea of Stars is completely different.
1162635	1169058	It's like a retro-inspired RPG.
1169058	1169578	Oh, no.
1169578	1170479	I know what that is now.
1170479	1172360	Yeah, I was going to say.
1172360	1175942	If I have time, but my retro night is actually for retro games.
1177507	1189470	So, like, games... My Retro Night is specifically RPGs that came out in Japan that did not originally come out in the US.
1191494	1194796	So like Final Fantasy V took a long time.
1194796	1204340	It's here now, but for years and years it was- Or Seiken Densetsu 3 or Live Alive or Rayearth, Terranigma, you know.
1204340	1210123	I started Star Ocean before that, but I'll go back to it a little bit later.
1210123	1219548	That's kind of, well, I mean, I did, I did play through Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IV, but I played direct translations with the censorship removed.
1219548	1220008	Oh, interesting.
1222706	1225408	But that's the kind of thing that I'm going for.
1225408	1231954	Although I may switch to Mega Drive stuff later and do Phantasy Star 2.
1231954	1235056	Like the original, unedited Phantasy Star 2.
1235056	1236838	Or a few other things, who knows.
1236838	1241902	But that was... Rayearth is going to be next.
1243526	1249309	And then, um, I played some Cult of the Lamb to see if they did anything special.
1249309	1251290	I didn't see anything yet.
1251290	1253231	Um, but that's kind of it.
1253231	1258113	And I'm still trying to find a way to play, uh, Palia.
1258113	1260294	Uh, let's go over to Loki then.
1260294	1262155	How was your gaming week?
1262155	1265457	Um, I played mostly Minecraft this week as usual.
1265457	1267818	Um, so I've just been working on, you know,
1268794	1272697	I was messing around, I guess, and gathering materials and all that stuff.
1272697	1275458	I started some editing today.
1275458	1277820	But I did actually play one other thing.
1277820	1285585	So I noticed at our local department store, they had a demo for Super Mario Wonder.
1285585	1290348	So I got to play that, and it's a Mario game!
1290348	1290608	I mean...
1291478	1292299	Cool.
1292299	1292699	It's pretty.
1292699	1295221	That was such enthusiasm.
1295221	1296863	It's I mean, it's it's cool.
1296863	1300366	Like, I really I like the way it looks and stuff.
1300366	1301967	But I mean, it's like a 2D Mario game.
1301967	1302988	I don't know.
1302988	1305230	It's not like that's a good thing.
1305230	1305910	Wildly different.
1305910	1306771	No, it's not.
1306771	1307151	It's not.
1307151	1308412	It's not a bad thing.
1308412	1309533	It's not wildly different.
1309533	1312596	But yeah, it's neat to check it out.
1312596	1312716	So.
1314600	1315841	I'm actually a little bummed.
1315841	1320706	There's actually a lot going on for me, like for Rob Roberts Gaming Jams next week.
1320706	1322208	There's a lot happening.
1322208	1323589	I'm like, I'm not sad.
1323589	1324470	I'm going on vacation.
1324470	1324950	Not at all.
1324950	1326392	But it's just the timing is very funny.
1326392	1335080	For example, Diablo 4 Season 2 and the huge patch that's supposed to fix a ton of quality of life stuff is on Tuesday, the day I leave.
1335080	1335501	And then
1336962	1344565	on the 20th is when Wonder releases, which I already have pre-ordered from the Nintendo voucher thing, so I won't be here when that releases either because I'm at TwitchCon.
1344565	1352969	Again, hard to be upset considering the circumstances, but it's just one of those like, of course, the timing is always weird with stuff like that, so a big week for me personally.
1352969	1354610	A lot to catch up on when I get back, that's for sure.
1356672	1373348	If you're done with your gaming week, then I will talk about my gaming week, which honestly was probably a little less than usual because I had the double shot of the flu vaccine and the updated COVID booster on Monday and left me a little tired Monday on into Tuesday.
1373348	1378392	Everybody is affected different by that stuff, and it always seems to lay me out, even though
1379153	1406304	it may have I don't know it may have been the flu shot too you can't always pin this on the COVID shot because the flu shot has always done this to me too always um I got Pfizer for the very first time so I've had like four Moderna shots and one Pfizer shot so finally I'm gonna have to go get mine tomorrow yeah yeah and I'll be doing ballet oh that's gonna suck yeah so um but uh yeah so I got that so it kind of knocked me out like our the Monday playthrough I was planning with Shane on Pokemon Gen 9 like has been really
1406764	1410610	Like with me being sick last week and then me having the side effects this week.
1410610	1412052	Now I'm going on vacation next week.
1412052	1412653	Like it sucks.
1412653	1417320	But that project, unfortunately, is going to have to just kind of wait until all this stuff is behind us a little bit.
1417320	1419023	So sorry to the folks that are looking forward to that.
1419023	1420545	But just, you know, things happen and happens.
1421847	1450967	but uh you know i've been continuing to play the outdoor games that i have been doing such as pikmin uh monster hunter now uh i think i'm up to like level 42 or something in monster hunter now uh i did pokemon community day today uh technically i was also doing pikmin day because i wanted to do 10 000 steps and get my little badge but yeah i i thought i would catch some limited time pokemon and you know or shinies and all that stuff uh i don't remember how many shiny timbers i got i think something like 11 like it was a ridiculous amount it was it was unnecessary
1451687	1473356	Um, but yeah, I did that, and then, um, as far as other games, not a lot a lot, uh, continue to do a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, mostly because my island sanctuary is the most important thing to me in that game, and I don't want to fall behind, and I want to make sure I hit max rank as well, that's also very important, so, uh, there's that, and then, um,
1474977	1483306	I've also been playing World of Warcraft Classic, which is now on the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.
1483306	1490254	I started that up so I could play, you know, WoW when many would argue it was at its peak, which was during Wrath of the Lich King.
1490254	1492957	They just added to the game this week, finally.
1493802	1518919	looking for group and I know it seems weird to talk about them adding things to classic but technically looking for group actually debuted during the last patch of the birding crusade so it was always in wrath of the lich king um it's just for whatever reason the classic thing they were keeping looking for group out of it for some time it was a controversial thing but they finally have decided to put that in the game and um I've been having fun with it it is definitely
1519920	1546182	some things have not aged as well as others but you know you you kind of know what you're getting into when you play a classic like that for sure so um but otherwise that's that's really it i haven't been playing a lot of console stuff this week at all uh just mostly pc stuff and pretty lightly just with everything else that's been going on so um hopefully we'll get back into things next week as i mentioned a lot of stuff on the horizon for me for when i get back from twitchcom so that's that
1547033	1550256	Alright, let's get into some more gaming news.
1550256	1552978	I've mentioned enough times we're not going to be here next week.
1552978	1559403	I should point out Bobby Blackwolf, also on the Voice Geeks Network before us on Sunday night, also will not be here next week.
1559403	1561945	He is also at TwitchCon.
1561945	1569872	He is actually going to be working with Games Done Quick Express, hosting some of the runs, because you may know Bobby does some of the hosting, some of the voiceover work.
1570713	1572334	for reading donations and things like that.
1572334	1577338	He's done that for the actual week-long events over the last few seasons.
1577338	1581862	But TwitchCon is actually doing like a mini-GDQ, GDQ Express.
1581862	1587546	It doesn't run 24 hours, but it runs during the time that TwitchCon is running, which is still a pretty good chunk of the day.
1587546	1591730	And Bobby is doing the opening hosting for Friday and Sunday.
1591730	1593951	So, you know, when the whole thing starts on Friday at 10am,
1594732	1595552	check it out.
1595552	1601393	You'll get to hear Bobby reading some donations and everything is benefiting AbleGamers is the charity.
1601393	1603874	The Games Done Quick Express is benefiting and that is cool.
1603874	1608334	I've I have actually had my Amazon Prime on AbleGamers for quite some time.
1608334	1608935	What do they call it?
1608935	1609735	Smile?
1609735	1613295	Amazon, Amazon Smile has been tied to AbleGamers for quite some time.
1613295	1616416	So it's a great charity.
1616416	1620417	So I hope GDQ does very, very well at TwitchCon.
1620417	1621917	So but at some point,
1623089	1627252	because this is the very first time Bobby's ever been to Vegas.
1627252	1631415	At some point, I'm hoping Bobby we can take him to the pinball Hall of Fame.
1631415	1633157	Because that place is a lot of fun.
1633157	1635438	And I definitely want to see his reaction to that.
1635438	1640542	And I know my partner Alan will not be opposed to going to that because they have all the Elvira tables.
1640542	1641343	They're his favorite.
1641343	1642844	And that's it's just a fun place to hang out.
1642844	1643785	And it's a huge building.
1643785	1646467	So excited to go check that out.
1647487	1652409	All right, um, let's get on Oh, they did they shut down smile two years ago.
1652409	1654550	I didn't even know that.
1654550	1659872	Because I, I've been very bad about actually going to smile dot Amazon.
1659872	1660172	Really?
1660172	1662753	I had no idea they cut they shut that down.
1662753	1663913	Sad.
1663913	1666114	Oh, well.
1666114	1667715	You try to do something good.
1667715	1670056	Was it really two years ago?
1670056	1671336	What is time anymore?
1671336	1674737	My god, it feels like just last week I was on there.
1674737	1675278	My god.
1675278	1675558	All right.
1676356	1681619	Anyway, let's move on and talk about what's going on in gaming news.
1681619	1683520	And we will start with Loki.
1683520	1684941	Pretty big headline.
1684941	1689003	Yeah, so I mean, it was bound to come out at some point.
1689003	1689163	This
1689785	1697410	This, there is hints that who, the search of course of the Mario voice actor, who's it gonna be?
1697410	1717163	So originally there was some folks that were data mining the kiosk demo for Mario Wonder and they were able to find a list of voice actors in the game and were trying to figure out based off of the voice actors that are in the code, mentioned in the code of the game
1717743	1718724	News on Twitter is fake.
1741217	1741717	Not always.
1741717	1742218	Yeah, yeah.
1742218	1743019	Sometimes it is.
1743019	1745240	90% of the time news on Twitter is fake.
1745240	1755349	Well, I think they were just guessing because they're like, Oh, well, if if, you know, Kevin Afghani is going to be doing the talking flower, then surely they're not going to be doing Mario as well.
1755349	1756550	Well, come to find out.
1756550	1757851	No, they're actually doing both.
1757851	1766798	So, you know, Kevin Afghani did announce finally on Twitter that, yes, I am going to be the voice of Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros.
1766798	1767599	Water.
1767599	1767959	Good for him.
1769304	1771265	Yep, he's young.
1771265	1774706	You know, he's like, he's a baby compared to us.
1774706	1779528	I was like, or at least like this guy can be groomed, like late late 20s or something like that.
1779528	1780429	Right?
1780429	1783230	So yeah, no, I that's not a knock.
1783230	1784391	I was it's just one of those things.
1784391	1792134	I was like, wow, it's like, he's a young guy, especially, you know, like, they're, they're assuming that he will be doing the role in future games.
1792134	1794515	Because honestly, that is kind of an assumption right now.
1795055	1798197	He did not say, I'm the new voice of Mario forever and ever.
1798197	1810905	He said, I'm the new voice of Mario in Mario Brothers Wonder that, you know, one can infer that likely means you will see him in future games, just as the voice of Bowser is also still in this game.
1810905	1812487	They didn't change the other voice actors.
1812487	1819231	They only changed because Toadette and Peach is also still in this game.
1819231	1822153	Rosalina is not, but I just don't think the character of Rosalina is in the game.
1822573	1826957	So they're still using the other Mario voice actors they've been using.
1826957	1831280	And I know those names because of Southern Fried and the panel I did there and getting to meet all them.
1831280	1832541	So they're still in Mario Wonder.
1832541	1834923	It's just Mario has changed for whatever reason.
1834923	1836604	We've already kind of gotten into that.
1836604	1838565	It is what it is with Charles Martinet.
1838565	1842268	He will make a fabulous living traveling the country.
1842268	1847773	And, you know, if you feel really, really upset that Charles Martinet is gone, go give him your money.
1847773	1850435	You will have the opportunity to go give Charles Martinet your money.
1850435	1851375	And you should.
1851375	1852036	You should do that.
1852656	1858298	Yeah, and we're all assuming that like, you know, it's Nintendo saying that Charles, you can't do this.
1858298	1859759	Maybe he just doesn't want to.
1859759	1861240	Maybe like he wants to do it.
1861240	1863961	Maybe it's just harder for him to do it now or something.
1863961	1864761	I don't know.
1864761	1867762	We don't know what's, you know, going on with Charles.
1867762	1871144	Maybe there's maybe there's some health issues we ever heard about.
1871144	1871964	You know, you never know.
1871964	1875045	Like I wouldn't assume that it's just like, well, you're too old.
1875045	1878166	So we're just going to let you go type of thing.
1878166	1879207	You know, I don't think
1880354	1884598	And people thinking he's too old is honestly ageism at work.
1884598	1885599	Well, I don't know.
1885599	1887361	I don't know.
1887361	1889403	Well, people assuming that was the reason.
1889403	1890323	I'll just be honest.
1890323	1893526	They may have and this could be a little bit of a mix.
1893526	1898371	And what I'm going to say is they may have wanted a new like five year contract or something.
1899197	1906040	And maybe when Charles Marnier started to look at a five-year commitment or some type of extended commitment, that could have been, again, I'm totally theorizing.
1906040	1911163	I don't know shit, but they could have been trying to make a deal of some length.
1911163	1918506	And maybe those years commitment was something he didn't want to do because, you know, like, I would like to retire, please.
1918506	1927270	You know, and I have I was just going to say it just fucking sucks that we're sitting here on one hand talking about Bobby Kotick going into forced retirement and the type of money he's going to make.
1928007	1930548	That money should be going to Charles Martinet.
1930548	1939833	Like, what television judge courtroom program can I go be an advocate on that Bobby Kotick's money should in fact go to Charles Martinet?
1939833	1942034	How can we as gamers make that happen?
1946347	1947948	I have a take on this one.
1947948	1948928	Go for it.
1948928	1962394	And first of all, I doubt Age has anything to do with it, because if June 4-Ray could do, you know, Rocky the Squirrel, you know, well into her 90s, you know, Age has nothing to do with it.
1962394	1963755	I mean, after a while, yeah.
1963755	1965756	I mean, she didn't do the voice as well as she used to.
1965756	1968617	She still did Natasha, you know, all of it.
1968617	1970118	But here's the thing.
1970118	1970578	It doesn't matter.
1971845	1972966	We don't know the story.
1972966	1974207	No one knows the story.
1974207	1978211	If you don't know the story, you really shouldn't try to speculate an opinion on it.
1978211	1980313	At least that's how I feel about it.
1980313	1988100	You know, making an opinion without having fact to back it up is, to me, kind of a useless endeavor.
1988100	1996468	I, I just, all I want for him is to be happy and who's ever doing the voice to not fuck it up.
1998743	2008509	Well, you lead to a good point because I think a lot of the concern with somebody new coming on was that the internet was going to bully this person into submission.
2008509	2012172	The good news is, for the most part, that doesn't appear to be happening.
2012172	2015474	Most of the replies on Twitter were pretty positive.
2017055	2025940	as he even went so far as to write a follow-up tweet, I think earlier today, that said something in the effect of, I'm really touched by all the nice things people are saying.
2025940	2045012	There were a few naysayers in the comments, and unfortunately, because of the idiot that runs Twitter, who decided to allow people to pay, to literally pay to be dumpster fires and get elevated to the top of the comments, unfortunately, some of the top comments were things like,
2046467	2071703	We don't want our Mario to have pronouns in bio and things like that because Kevin Afghani is a good ally who puts he him in his bio because I had hoped at some point Twitter would have just had that as a field that you can put it in such as discord implemented what like not even a year ago you know things like that is that it would just be a field you put it in and it's no big deal
2072203	2083907	But because that's not there and it's not going to happen, see my earlier statement about the idiot in charge, he has chosen to put his pronouns in bio and and of course people take issue with that.
2083907	2084988	And you know what?
2084988	2086988	The block the block function still exists.
2086988	2088249	That sure does.
2088249	2090630	And that's that's definitely getting some usage there.
2090630	2091270	Like just
2092541	2100147	But I mean, the thing is, I didn't go into this expecting for there to be a lot of hate and trolling and everything.
2100147	2109534	Because on average, at least in my experience, Nintendo fans are pretty gracious people, you know?
2109534	2120743	The expectations have been set at a certain level that maybe it's not going to be, you know, that if Nintendo is putting out a game,
2121795	2128879	they're gonna, you know, bust their ass to make what they really feel is a good Mario game, you know?
2128879	2135683	I can't say anything about any of the third parties having seen Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch and wanting to cry.
2135683	2137965	But I also know the capability's not there.
2137965	2150993	But back to my point, it's, um... I have experienced more positive than negative.
2150993	2151333	Myself.
2153200	2158683	Yeah, I mean, but then again, maybe it's just because I have the majority of the assholes on block already.
2158683	2159584	Yeah.
2159584	2170110	And some folks in chat, like Bobby is saying, have you heard how upset folks get when Nintendo doesn't show the exact trailer they want during a Nintendo Direct, even if they directly tell you what they're going to be talking about?
2170110	2175093	So, well, here's the thing about that, too.
2175093	2181356	That the loudest people out there are going to be the people who complain.
2181356	2182477	That is a minority of people.
2183608	2199331	I would also like to think that some of it that goes into it is some of the choice to not announce who it was for some time, to allow a little bit of distance of the Charles Martinet retirement or, you know, role change, whatever you want to call it, news, to allow a little distance between that.
2199331	2207332	Because I do think there has been a lot of talk on various social media, not just the one we've been referencing, but, you know, Facebook, Instagram, so forth.
2207332	2211453	There's been talk about basically, you know, hey, this is something that's happening.
2212033	2215175	whoever is coming into this role can't control what happened.
2215175	2217717	This is not Kevin Afghani's fault.
2217717	2220099	This is his opportunity to shine.
2220099	2222401	So y'all better act right for the new person.
2222401	2237332	And I feel like there's been time for that message to kind of get around, get around the people really should just act right and give this new guy a chance that for the vast majority, like obviously there's always going to be dumb dumbs on Twitter, but the vast majority of people are giving this person a fair shot.
2237332	2238533	And that's good.
2238533	2241695	I would even just go that back to act right.
2241695	2241815	Yeah.
2243837	2245058	Unqualified.
2245058	2247580	I mean this.
2247580	2253785	I've been trying to have a little bit more faith in people, you know, it doesn't often happen.
2253785	2256948	But you must not read the comments, which I should tell myself.
2256948	2258630	I always remind myself, don't do it.
2258630	2259070	Don't do it.
2259070	2259811	But I can't help it.
2259811	2260771	I can't help it.
2260771	2262873	It's like, it's like, why?
2262873	2265455	I don't read the comments because I'm lazy.
2265455	2267097	And therefore I'm not disappointed.
2269638	2274121	It's like, I knew, I knew if you look at a circus, you're gonna see clowns.
2274121	2277383	And that's what the Twitter comments are every fucking time.
2277383	2282767	So it's just, I need to learn to not do that.
2282767	2287491	And honestly enough, there's something else that I've learned through doing this show.
2287491	2290332	There are some opinions that I just don't care.
2290332	2290893	That's fair.
2290893	2291934	It's fair.
2291934	2296637	If I know you, or if you know me as a person,
2297376	2300297	I'll take your opinion in good faith.
2300297	2312303	And if you're just a person who has never met me in person and only knows me, well, I wouldn't say in person, but a person who... I'm trying to think of how to phrase this.
2312303	2317246	I don't trust the opinions of people on the Internet.
2317246	2317966	That's a good policy.
2319605	2322666	Um, like I don't know them and they don't know me.
2322666	2331087	There's no basis until we have a conversation and I understand the heart of the opinion, then I can make a judgment on it.
2331087	2334888	I think this is a cute comment in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
2334888	2342169	SSJ100 Matt says, I hope there's a cute moment at the game awards where they both present an award together as a passing of the torch kind of thing.
2342169	2343969	That is, that's cute.
2343969	2344450	I'd love that.
2344450	2345570	That'd be nice.
2345570	2346590	But to be fair,
2347755	2350197	If it doesn't happen, I don't think we should be disappointed either.
2350197	2357862	Just because there's a part of me that says, if I were Charles Martinet, I could absolutely think, you know what?
2357862	2359503	I don't want to be on that stage.
2359503	2361004	This is his moment.
2361004	2364527	I'm just going to do my thing at these, you know, small town conventions around the country.
2364527	2364867	You know what?
2364867	2367188	I'm gonna let him shine on that stage by himself.
2367188	2370431	And I think that's, that's an a-okay thing to do as well.
2370431	2370971	So.
2370971	2374173	Honestly, if I were Charles Martinet, I'd be like, where's my margarita?
2378595	2382216	Where is something that doesn't involve a video game?
2382216	2384097	And my margarita.
2384097	2388878	I'm gonna play croquet in my garden, like in Heather's.
2388878	2393139	So here would be my suggestion if Charles Martinet politely declines that idea.
2393139	2397000	Here's my completely feasible suggestion.
2397000	2405162	Have Ben Starr do it instead as the Mario passing of the torch and get up there and act all upset that he didn't get the role and do the whole
2405819	2410842	Yeah, well, I, I heard that you were actually going to be the voice of Mario.
2410842	2412863	And, you know, I was going for that role.
2412863	2415244	And I, I have right bit to be upset right now.
2415244	2417465	You know, like, have him do that whole thing.
2417465	2419046	And I think that would be very funny.
2419046	2424688	And that that's something that could be done instead.
2424688	2425649	All right.
2425649	2431012	Anyhow, best of luck to get I will say, you know what, in the little clips we've heard so far, he's fine.
2431012	2432732	He's gonna do just fine.
2432732	2433433	It's gonna be fine.
2434436	2435917	The game's going to be fine.
2435917	2436637	So good luck.
2436637	2437157	Good luck to him.
2437157	2439878	And I look forward to hearing what he's got in store for these characters.
2439878	2441859	Destabilize a fandom?
2441859	2444360	We're already unstable people.
2444360	2445541	Gamers?
2445541	2446862	All right.
2446862	2447442	Let's move on.
2447442	2448442	We got some more news.
2448442	2450903	Let's talk about what's going on in PlayStation's world.
2450903	2455585	You know, we anticipated that there would probably be a PlayStation 5 mini at some point.
2455585	2457306	And sure enough, it is coming.
2457306	2461808	The PlayStation 5 Slim was officially announced this last week.
2461808	2463429	And as some of the rumors said,
2464533	2465794	It did line up with this.
2465794	2469115	It will have a detachable drive.
2469115	2479139	This means if you buy the PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition, you could change your mind later and spend $80 to get a drive to add to the console.
2479139	2483781	So we knew that through some of the trademarks and things that had gone through earlier.
2483781	2485922	Although not every trademark becomes reality.
2485922	2487923	It did kind of seem this was the direction they were going.
2488323	2497609	And it does, I will say with the little form factor of the device, if you've seen this, it does slide on in a pretty interesting way.
2497609	2500431	Like it does look very like
2501290	2523378	it doesn't stand out like it doesn't look like the HD DVD plugin for the Xbox where it just kind of sat there on the side like it does fit into the shape of where they're going with the PlayStation 5 mini like I it does work so um I think it does does look pretty cool but people have the decision if they want to buy one versus the other however here's the interesting thing
2524118	2528264	Even though the PlayStation 5 Slim is smaller, guess what?
2528264	2531147	The Digital Edition will actually cost more money.
2532087	2537208	it's going to be $450 versus the current $400 edition that's out there.
2537208	2542849	So that means if you want one of those digital editions, you better buy it before it's gone.
2542849	2553651	Or you're going to have to hope you luck into one on a Kmart shelf at one of the three Kmarts left in America later on, like that one person who bought a Wii U in September as that story was going around.
2553651	2558332	I think the reason they were more expensive is because they have more storage on them.
2558592	2578661	yes that is true they do have more storage uh so and which if it is a digital edition that makes sense that you'd want to have the one terabyte and all that so there is that uh five hundred dollars if you want to get the uh ultra hd blu-ray disc included drive uh with the system bundle there november is when this rolls out and it will roll out globally
2579181	2589808	in the coming months and Sony is confirming when the current PlayStation 5 model has sold out it is no longer going to be made it's done so all right cool
2592355	2614868	this is this is the future of PlayStation five but it makes you know it this has been rumored for some time and makes a lot of sense for the holiday the current I'm looking up because I'm looking at my current PlayStation five that's sitting on the same shelf as the devices that run OLR and I it is kind of a big it is a big monster of a system so you know it makes a lot of sense but yeah um
2616142	2620290	If you still don't have a PlayStation 5, maybe this will be appetizing to you.
2620290	2623175	I don't know, Loki, you're the one I know without a PlayStation 5.
2623175	2624598	Does this look interesting to you?
2625558	2633442	No, because like, honestly, now it's it's come down to exclusives for Sony and a lot of that stuff ends up coming to PC.
2633442	2635483	So no, not at this point.
2635483	2640245	Like, it's unfortunate because, you know, I would be interested in like PlayStation VR, too.
2640245	2644848	But once again, I'm not paying a thousand dollars to jump in for like a couple of games.
2644848	2645788	Like, no, thanks.
2645788	2647329	And you said I just.
2647329	2647689	Yeah.
2647689	2647869	Sorry.
2647869	2649190	You said you didn't have one either, DarkSakura?
2649190	2650250	I thought you did.
2650250	2650651	No.
2650651	2651551	Oh, I thought you did for some reason.
2652648	2655509	And neither do I have one of the Xboxes.
2655509	2659150	Is this... I have to ask, is this tempting?
2659150	2662470	Now that they're gonna be slimmer, can fit the shelf easier?
2662470	2664391	No.
2664391	2668592	Still not really anything on there I care about.
2668592	2669572	Same with Xbox.
2669572	2674173	I mean, I'll be perfectly honest, I'm having a lot of fun with just what I'm playing already.
2675617	2677278	and I like playing on my Mac.
2677278	2690646	Well, and we see that this generation more than any others, a lot of the Sony exclusive quote unquote titles and inherently a lot of the Xbox exclusive titles end up on home computers as well.
2690646	2693667	Like it's just the fact of this particular generation.
2693667	2697309	Like if you wait long enough, Final Fantasy 16 will be out on PC.
2697309	2699130	God of War Ragnarok will be out on PC.
2699130	2701232	Like all that stuff is going to be on PC eventually.
2701232	2702432	So I get it.
2702432	2703593	So, you know,
2704453	2714441	Yeah, and also like back to the $1,000 for like PlayStation VR 2 thing, like I also don't trust them to like, you know, make content for that for a very long time.
2714441	2723268	I think they're just gonna forget, they're gonna Vita it, you know, they're gonna forget about it eventually once it's not turning them enough of a profit and
2724237	2735263	Like, I just can't... If, like, the PlayStation VR 2, like, also doubled as, like, a PC VR, then yeah, maybe that might be worth it, but, like, for just what it is...
2736352	2737493	No, I'll wait.
2737493	2745902	Like, you know, I really do want to play, you know, that Rush of Blood, Spiritual Seek, you know, successor, but not that much.
2745902	2751428	Like, it's just... That PSVR 2 is on its way to being a disaster of a device.
2751428	2752850	And it's not because of the hardware.
2752850	2753891	The hardware is great.
2753891	2755853	It's... Oh, yeah.
2755853	2758235	I hope maybe some changing of the guard at Sony.
2759457	2777757	It may be too late, I don't know, but I hope some changing of the guard at Sony can strategically change the plan for VR a little bit, because right now, that thing is... I don't know what it really looks like sales-wise, but I would be hard-pressed to not believe it's a disaster of a device, because the software is not there to support it.
2779736	2789907	It's more like, I'm looking at a Quest 3 even, and I'm on the fence with that even, because I know I will buy it and it will end up in a box.
2789907	2795693	I just don't have the space for VR, unfortunately.
2795693	2799156	But I do like VR, I do like playing VR games.
2800582	2804844	Um, it's cumbersome to like set up an area to do that.
2804844	2809866	I just wish it was, you know, I had more space in my house, but I do want one.
2809866	2814748	Like, I think it would be great because I have a Rift S and that's pretty old at this point.
2814748	2821550	So even a Quest 3 allowing me to play PC games I have on my PC that, you know, could clearly handle them.
2821550	2823171	I think that would be a really good experience.
2825312	2828134	All right, well, let's move on with some more news.
2828134	2830356	This is a completely different type of story.
2830356	2833018	DarkSakura.
2833018	2837382	So well, you know, I like to look at the way video games help society.
2837382	2838322	I think we all do.
2838322	2850912	So there, there is a $5 million NIH grant going to Parkinson's research with patients playing video games during brain surgery.
2852545	2857207	And it's looking into how the brain regulates movement.
2857207	2878795	So the assistant professor of bioengineering at UC Riverside, and I'm going to try to pronounce his name, Vasileios Christopoulos, is leading a project, it's a five-year project, that lets them study people during surgery with electrodes while they're playing video games.
2879515	2889838	They're collaborating with folks at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Utah Southwestern Medical School, and the University of Iowa.
2889838	2900662	He's quoted saying, we will try to understand how our brain controls the actions we perform, how we make decisions between competing goals, how we stop moving, and how we switch actions.
2902620	2907602	So, which basically that's what Parkinson's does.
2907602	2916785	It's involved with action regulation, causing slower movements, difficulty stopping a movement, freezing, having trouble initiating new actions.
2916785	2919426	And it's all related to dopamine.
2919426	2923788	You actually lose dopamine as the disease progresses.
2923788	2929070	And one of the first things they do is provide like a synthetic dopamine for people.
2929910	2938013	And so one of the other things to test is dopamine response while you're playing a game.
2938013	2952418	So basically they're awake, they have electrodes implanted, they'll play video games with the joystick before, during, and after the surgery to see how the treatment works in real time.
2953258	2968499	And then that way, the other goal is to use all of this data gathered to build a large-scale mathematical model of the brain so that they will have a machine model that they can test with as well.
2969760	2978302	And for those who don't know, also about Parkinson's, it is the second most common neurodegenerative disease right after Alzheimer's.
2978302	2987844	Roughly 500,000 Americans are diagnosed with it, and it's doubled in the last 25 years, especially in people under 50.
2987844	2993986	So this is, I mean, it is a terminal disease.
2993986	2996987	Having ways of understanding how to combat its
2999688	3008814	The speed of its degeneration could certainly give people longer lives with a better quality of life.
3008814	3011056	So, I think it's a good idea.
3011056	3013637	This is a really good thing they're doing.
3016060	3026787	It's always nice to hear about how video games are kind of used to get those certain types of stimulations in the brain that have these very interesting effects.
3026787	3042879	On a somewhat related note, about like video games and that whole type of thing, I was seeing this study going around this week on social media again, I seem to remember this coming up on the show before years ago, but about like, if a child or even an adult experiences some type of traumatic event,
3043559	3068161	playing Tetris is apparently a really good way to help the brain kind of move past in a way that sort of traumatic event because the way that the spatial and the blocks kind of end up going into your brain and so forth help to kind of suppress some of the some of the damage that's happened by such a such a traumatic event, which I find that kind of stuff very fascinating.
3068161	3069162	That in person.
3069162	3069322	Yeah.
3070110	3074695	Tetris was actually a very useful tool to me, even as an adult, doing anything spatial and puzzle related.
3090842	3094245	I would say things that might have otherwise caused me a meltdown.
3094245	3099630	So really good as a way to make the brain work in a different dimension.
3099630	3100330	Yeah.
3100330	3105294	And it's interesting that Tetris is like always that game that we come back to.
3105294	3109298	And I'm sure there's probably other puzzle games that also fit the bill.
3109698	3113039	But obviously Tetris is by far the most well known of those games.
3113039	3127843	So it is very interesting that that one in particular, and I have no idea where it fits into this particular study, but just of some of these other, you know, kind of side related sort of things I've been seeing is interesting how it always comes back to Tetris in one way or another.
3127843	3132284	So yeah, Fonz006 says Tetris is good for all.
3132284	3135285	Yeah, just take two Tetris and call me in the morning.
3136510	3137471	All right.
3137471	3143914	Anything else to share on that particular exactly study?
3143914	3146816	Okay, no, just it'd be nice to see what comes of it.
3146816	3147777	Yep.
3147777	3149418	All right, let's move on.
3149418	3153340	And also something to see nice that this has come of this.
3153340	3155041	Loki, let's go to the next story.
3155595	3158117	Yes, it's about time.
3158117	3177892	So, of course, after all of this Unity debacle with the walkbacks and the unpopular change in payment structure, John Riccatello, the CEO of Unity, has decided to retire from Unity.
3177892	3180674	So he is going to be leaving the company.
3180674	3182936	He says, it's been my privilege to lead Unity.
3182936	3183737	Yeah, I'm sure no one cares.
3184738	3210312	um and so he is going to be helping the company transition to a new ceo at some point and i don't believe a ceo has been uh named yet he's also going to be earning 8.4 million dollars through stock options over the next six months and that's additionally to the 253 million dollars they already has in unity stock but at least
3211350	3213713	That part of the problem is gone.
3213713	3220483	Hopefully the next person they get, not Bobby Kotick, will lead the company in a better direction.
3222241	3247599	it's you know what here's the thing like I could say something sassy or bitchy but the reality is I when this news happened I said where's the accountability and oh well ding ding the accountability train has arrived at the station and guess who it's taking away like finally the thing that is hap that should be happening is happening and so it's like okay this this is good news applause
3247659	3248380	accountability.
3248380	3249080	It feels good.
3249080	3249881	It feels good.
3249881	3251802	Yes, this is this.
3251802	3253223	We got what we wanted.
3253223	3254203	Our game is happy.
3254203	3255344	Yes.
3255344	3256305	Starting the shift.
3256305	3259007	We got Bobby Kotick is leaving.
3259007	3260748	John Riccatello is leaving.
3260748	3265051	Some of the former, you know, higher ups at Ubisoft are being prosecuted.
3265051	3266912	Like just starting this.
3266912	3267372	Yeah, it is.
3267372	3267673	It is.
3267673	3268713	It is a nice change of pace.
3268713	3270294	But since you brought up.
3270294	3271435	Is it Hanukkah?
3271435	3272096	Yes.
3272096	3272836	Almost.
3272836	3274958	Since you brought up Bobby Kotick.
3275698	3278961	This is what should have happened to Bobby Kotick a long time ago.
3278961	3283964	And it's nice to see that this is happening to John Riccatello.
3283964	3288027	And not everybody is going to like what I'm about to say, but too bad.
3288027	3291450	What John Riccatello did is not as bad as what Bobby Kotick did.
3291450	3293171	No, not by far.
3293171	3293912	By far.
3293912	3297835	John Riccatello is greedy, which is a lot of CEOs are greedy.
3297835	3299936	They make greedy decisions.
3299936	3301778	Whereas Bobby Kotick is actually
3302768	3303628	a horrible human being
3321723	3325445	Factually way worse.
3325445	3330788	So it does kind of suck that the accountability train didn't take him away in the middle of the night.
3330788	3341495	But like Loki pointed out, it is nice to see this interesting trend in the past few months of accountability trains showing up in different places, which is
3344466	3347928	Some comments and chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
3347928	3350530	Bonz006 says, say it with your chest, Rob.
3350530	3351911	I will, I will.
3351911	3354813	Not a tear will be shed at these guys leaving.
3354813	3357935	SSG0100Matt says, now do Yves Guillaumon.
3357935	3360017	Good point.
3360017	3366381	Questbuster says, this really was a rare display of accountability for a CEO after a disaster of this size.
3368400	3373463	This is what has to happen for people to trust Unity again.
3373463	3384068	I would argue, in fact, that there will be developers out there who will now say, OK, we're going to trust Unity again because the train took them away.
3384068	3389351	And now this company maybe is going to be led in a different way, which we can trust Unity again.
3389351	3390051	Not everybody.
3390051	3392613	I'm not saying like, oh, everybody can just like get over it completely.
3393766	3399648	But there's gonna be more people now that will say, okay, I can work with Unity again.
3399648	3401468	Mm-hmm.
3401468	3405810	Yeah, I think there are some people that are on board with that.
3405810	3407230	But not everybody.
3407230	3410011	I think there's some people that's like, that's too late, you know.
3410011	3410391	Yeah.
3410391	3412411	I'm sorry, Jamie, what were you saying?
3412411	3413652	They're still charging, though.
3414734	3415054	Right.
3415054	3417597	It's a it's a very modified version of it.
3417597	3420219	That's completely not like what they originally put out there.
3420219	3421160	It's very different.
3421160	3422181	Yeah.
3422181	3425363	So there was a there was a follow up, but I think it might have been one of the weeks you were out.
3425363	3426925	So.
3426925	3427225	All right.
3427816	3432617	Um, well, let's move on and talk about this story, which I find very interesting.
3432617	3438279	And it has to do with AI because you know, our industry can't shut up about this right now.
3438279	3439799	And I understand it's everywhere.
3439799	3446941	And we have a case of a voice actor being replaced with AI in a video game.
3446941	3448001	But the twist is,
3449045	3454131	There was permission given in this scenario by the estate of the deceased actor.
3454131	3455974	So what's going on?
3455974	3460659	Cyberpunk 2077, of course, uses a variety of voice actors.
3460659	3466527	I'm going to horribly mispronounce this name because it's in a language I don't speak, but Milgust Rezek.
3466987	3471129	who is a Polish performer who did Polish voice acting in the game.
3471129	3474890	He played the character of Wiktor Vector, but that's in the Polish version of the game.
3474890	3481873	So if you've only played the English version of the game, you've never heard the person, but he was important in the Polish version of the game.
3481873	3483214	He passed away in 2021.
3483214	3491317	A report came out this week that showed that the studio moved on from this setback with the help of artificial intelligence.
3491917	3502043	In a statement to Bloomberg, CD Projekt Red explained that when they developed the Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077, they weighed a few options.
3502768	3504811	Would they replace Rezik?
3504811	3508635	Would they re-record his lines in the base game with the new voice actor?
3508635	3522111	But, as stated by the localization director, Mikolaj Sved, the idea was rejected in favor of AI, which could keep the performance in the game and pay tribute to his wonderful performance as Victor Vector.
3522892	3528156	So what they did, they hired a new voice actor to record all the necessary lines.
3528156	3537563	And then a voice cloning Ukraine-based software called ReSpeecher made an algorithm to alter the dialogue to sound like Rezek.
3537563	3546869	The use of AI in the Phantom Liberty expansion was done with permission, and that is a very important part of this whole story, from the family.
3546869	3548971	The sons were very supportive of this whole thing.
3549967	3555351	It's interesting because you've seen this sort of permission granted in other places.
3555351	3570302	Just in the last week or two, we've seen the story floating around about James Earl Jones, one of the most infamous voices in Hollywood, has given permission for AI to continue to use his voice as the voice of Darth Vader in the future.
3570302	3577287	He basically no longer does the role anymore, but in the future, he will be able to do this through AI.
3577287	3578788	So anyway,
3579893	3601560	Obviously, you know, the permission makes this a little more ethically in the clear, but it's still a little bit of a slippery slope because AI as a whole, not just really in gaming, but in Hollywood, we know this is a really key part of where the SAG-AFTRA debate and those negotiations and all that are going on right now is the use of AI.
3601560	3604641	And, you know, this is going to continue to be a hot button issue and so forth.
3606988	3608329	some comments in chat.
3608329	3610830	Quest Buster says Bobby clarified on his show.
3610830	3614912	This is the localized Polish version of CP 27 seven Phantom Liberty.
3614912	3617574	Yes, I hope I made that clear when I was reading the story.
3617574	3622577	The part his character also features in one of the endings you can get based on the decisions.
3622577	3627479	So dark to see you said I need to clarify my stance from what I said on Bobby show.
3627479	3632062	I feel like the family's blessing carries a little more weight than the naysayers on social media.
3634933	3637495	I'm actually going to say something here.
3637495	3639136	I still don't like this.
3639136	3641258	I don't.
3641258	3642159	Hold on, hold on.
3642159	3643099	Please let me finish.
3643099	3649044	I understand that ethically, does this clear this a little bit more ethically and so forth?
3649044	3649424	Yes.
3649424	3651406	And I don't have a problem with it on that front.
3652713	3667521	I'm not sure I love the idea of AI permanently giving people parts for the rest of time, because it doesn't allow other people to ever take on the role.
3667521	3681889	And like, I think about things like on Broadway, where you very oftentimes have many, many, many people that come in and play a role, you know, and I think about let's think about a play that's been on Broadway for forever, like Chicago,
3682089	3682409	JynxMonsoon
3697461	3703705	got to live their lifelong dream of being on Broadway, playing the part of Mama Morton in the production.
3703705	3710029	And when I saw Chicago on Broadway like 10 years ago, the Mama Morton I saw that night was great as well.
3710029	3714212	There's been a lot of very talented people that have gone through that production over the years.
3714212	3719375	My point is, I feel like if we keep relying on AI like this, it's going to allow... I mean,
3720992	3725795	Imagine if they'd done Charles Martinet's voice through AI, with his permission or whatever.
3725795	3732380	I mean, like it would, it would, it would rob these other up and comers of this opportunity to take on the role.
3732380	3736202	And we would never get to see other takes on characters.
3736202	3738364	So I don't know, I walk a weird line with this.
3738364	3741666	Because yes, I understand ethically, it's fine with permission, everything.
3741666	3742707	And I think when it's like,
3743327	3749951	Like a cameo or something like I think about Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.
3749951	3753633	I don't want to spoil too much, but had a cameo somewhere.
3753633	3757555	And it was a very brief thing to tie a story to somewhere else.
3757555	3759216	And I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about.
3759216	3759856	We'll leave it at that.
3760196	3766121	Okay, and like a cameo like that, like it bothers me a lot less, because I'm just kind of like, okay, I get it.
3766121	3771425	They're trying to like tie it to a very specific timeline, and a very specific iteration of that role.
3771425	3772907	And they have permission or whatever.
3772907	3775649	So that sits a little better with me.
3775649	3779332	But like, should someone own a role forever and ever?
3779332	3779792	I don't know.
3779792	3782234	Like, I'm just I, I don't think I love it.
3782234	3784336	Okay, sorry, Loki, I know you're trying to jump in there.
3784336	3784917	And I've said a lot.
3784917	3785157	Go ahead.
3786207	3791669	Oh, no, I was going to say, my only worry about it is now where they're giving the permission.
3791669	3803955	Now, I worry that in the future you'll have actors that will get permission through like a contract, but then the company is going to manipulate that contract to a point where it's like, well, now we just own your voice.
3803955	3806136	We don't need you anymore, you know, type of thing.
3806136	3809857	I'm worried that people are going to get into that scenario.
3809857	3812238	Thankfully, you know, at least the
3813759	3823944	SAG-AFTRA is going to be, you know, trying to prevent that type of scenario from happening, so hopefully there's something that comes of that, but I still worry.
3823944	3839150	I don't trust corporations like this, like, because especially of all the, like, shady stuff that they've done, like, I don't doubt that they're going to try to find a way to manipulate that, so it's like, oh, hey, we'll just, you know, we'll use this voice forever.
3839150	3841992	It's forever now, you know, so I don't know.
3844302	3852709	I can see what Rob is saying.
3852709	3863578	When the game version of Scarface was being worked on, they approached Al Pacino to do the part, but he said he just didn't sound the same as he did during the 80s, but he suggested another voice actor to take on the role instead.
3865288	3875337	E3VL says it puts a new definition of generational wealth and less opportunities for lower class in the future to rise up in social class.
3875337	3879921	SHO100mat talking about the SAG strikes.
3879921	3881563	The background actor thing is scary.
3881723	3883484	DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3917392	3924364	I feel about AI in general and the fact that companies want to use it without having to offer pay.
3925637	3939886	I honestly, I think that when you're dealing with a role that's iconic, like Vader, or going back to another example, you know, de-aging actors.
3939886	3946850	We talked about, I know Bobby had talked about that on his show earlier.
3946850	3951753	But I think I am fine if permission is granted.
3951753	3954235	I look at these roles as legacies.
3955693	3968698	You know, it's a way to keep the iconic voice and even the brand of the character alive after the originator is gone.
3968698	3973240	It's it's like having a painting, in my opinion.
3973240	3976741	That being said.
3976741	3981603	I. For the ones who are using things like
3983175	3994318	machine learning to generate voices to do these things without paying an actor to do it.
3994318	3997939	The estates are still being paid for the deceased.
3997939	4002300	The actors are still being paid for their permission.
4002300	4011702	But when you are using generated voices that are not given with express permission, that are learned voices,
4013324	4019228	And you don't have to pay the talent, you're just creating a voice.
4019228	4021069	That's what I have the problem with.
4021069	4034598	Things that are leading to basically preventing someone who could have provided that new voice for a new character or a new narration or
4035665	4048022	or just anything like it's really prevalent a lot on on certain YouTube videos out there and they're not paying they're not paying people for these roles they're they're renting a machine to do it you know
4049902	4054924	I think that, yeah, there are some roles that, yeah, it's fine for a recast.
4054924	4062847	I mean, how many times do we have a TV show come out and have, you know, characters from a movie recast and have them be much better?
4062847	4065228	Oh, Buffy.
4065228	4068009	James Bond, I think, is a great example.
4068009	4071590	Oh, right, but the whole thing behind his is kind of like The Doctor.
4071590	4071970	Yeah.
4071970	4076132	He regenerates into a different Bond, you know.
4076132	4076772	But, um,
4078222	4085947	But I think that in the case of a very iconic role, there's that.
4085947	4092812	In the past, it wasn't technologically possible to do.
4092812	4093812	Now it is.
4093812	4103278	And again, for these voices that we got to grow up listening to, I think it's great that people are going to get to keep it.
4103278	4103839	But again,
4105057	4110882	It goes back to paying the actor and paying their estate.
4110882	4111963	You see where the difference is?
4125104	4125624	fine plays.
4125624	4134950	I have no problem with what's going on here with the AI voice actor thing because they got permission and so forth.
4134950	4145277	I have seen in Final Fantasy XIV where, yeah, they did recast the character in a later expansion because the one couldn't come back for whatever reason, and it was fine.
4145277	4147619	Soap operas do recasting all the time and so forth.
4147619	4147959	So I just
4148519	4154300	I, I sort of understand like, you know, and I kind of reference like the legacy character, like, you know, Carrie Fisher and all that stuff.
4154300	4156301	Like, yeah, it was a short little cameo.
4156301	4157281	It was to tie it together.
4157281	4157741	I get it.
4157741	4158821	It's fine.
4158821	4164963	I just, you know, and if it's the same thing with Vader, where it's just a line or two, then whatever, like, I don't think it's as big of a deal.
4164963	4172224	But like, if I just don't want to see AI used to make somebody the main character again, type of thing, like recast the part of it's gonna go there.
4172224	4175105	That's, that's where I'm kind of like, on the fence.
4175105	4175165	Um,
4176218	4184183	Now, as far as what you get what you pay for when it comes to AI in some ways, I thank you chat who did post the clip here.
4184183	4191307	So I apologize to the podcast listeners, but I am going to show this here real quick for those that are watching on our Twitch channel here.
4191307	4196150	Somebody on TikTok actually oops, sorry, their audio came through too.
4196150	4197070	I thought I had it muted.
4197070	4198311	Sorry, folks.
4198311	4200572	So you can actually see there.
4200572	4203294	So there's that and then look at that look at that crowd.
4203294	4204975	And that AI like is that person you
4206283	4210325	Yeah, that looks you get what you pay for.
4210325	4212466	I'm completely against that.
4212466	4215748	They they are composite people.
4215748	4222452	They likely did not get any permission from the people whose likenesses went to train that machine.
4222452	4224012	Yeah.
4224012	4232557	And that is what I am against, things that are creating free labor from the work of other people.
4232557	4232677	Right.
4233320	4243489	Like for, to go back to the, you know, the Vader thing, the machine learned one voice and one voice only, and the voice got paid.
4243489	4257241	But when, say that, say that you go on one of those AI art things and like, I want a picture of a cat riding a unicorn playing guitar, but I want it done in the style of Da Vinci.
4259740	4266546	You know, it's taking all of the various, you know, it's stealing from a master, number one.
4266546	4272651	It's stealing from all the other artwork that came before it to teach that AI to create this image.
4272651	4278196	And on top of that, a lot of those are like, pick which one is more like what you want.
4278196	4285983	And you're getting the people who are paying you for the service to train your AI for free.
4285983	4287204	You know, I...
4289237	4291201	That's where my problem is.
4291201	4295168	I want there to be accreditation where it's due.
4295168	4297653	I want the people that contribute it paid for.
4297653	4298675	Or paid to, I should say.
4299934	4313343	and not being used as a quick replacement for avoiding having to hire extras or avoiding having to hire, you know, for other things.
4313343	4316985	Having to hire your artist, having to hire your graphic designer.
4316985	4320968	And another thing too, and I know that Fixie has brought this up before,
4321908	4332598	is there are people now who are soliciting to create artwork for independent content creators out there.
4332598	4337563	And people are paying, you know, $50, $100, $200 for something.
4337563	4344049	And these people are just generating AI art and sending it to them like they made it themselves.
4344049	4345971	And that right there is fraud.
4347905	4368352	I mean, the only thing is that these people can't claim any copyright on any of this work, but there has to be a set ethical standard for the use of AI in art, including voice acting, singing, artwork, acting, you name it.
4371152	4373574	All right, well, let's go ahead and move on.
4373574	4378898	This is unfortunately the AI thing, just like the Activision Blizzard Microsoft thing.
4378898	4380379	This ain't the last we're going to hear about it.
4380379	4388185	We're going to hear much, much more, especially as the game industry tries to figure this out, along with the film industry, like where those lines end up getting drawn.
4388185	4390887	So we're going to find that out from ongoing contract negotiations.
4392208	4393689	would do if they could get away with it.
4393689	4394650	If they could get away with it.
4394650	4398193	But that's why we have SAG-AFTRA to stop that.
4398193	4399835	So, all right.
4399835	4402857	Let's move on, though.
4402857	4408942	Let's go back to a cinematic classic since we're talking about film, DarkSakura.
4408942	4410063	Oh, yes.
4410063	4419952	So, and Dan messaged this to me earlier while I was busy working, and so I just kind of stopped and was like, oh,
4421385	4431813	So there is a mystery pinball company out there in existence that randomly announced that they were doing a labyrinth table.
4431813	4435196	And it turns out that the company is called Barrels of Fun Pinball.
4435196	4441161	I really like their logo icon, which is basically a flipper and a bald and like an exclamation point.
4441862	4444305	I think that's great.
4444305	4451774	But there are some really amazing people who are involved in this project.
4456618	4460022	Brian Savage, and a few more.
4460022	4465127	And there's a trailer out for the game and it looks amazing.
4465127	4472134	So they did get permission to use David Bowie's voice, lines from the film, to use his likeness.
4473812	4483757	No view of Jennifer Connelly, but I think the point of the game is that they're putting you as the protagonist in this, that you're traversing the labyrinth.
4483757	4485877	There are lots of sound clips from the movie.
4488050	4499198	I have a feeling that there's an oubliette mode, because I thought I saw, you know, heard a line from the oubliette and saw some of the things on the table.
4499198	4504981	There's a full motion video screen, kind of like the Jersey Jack tables.
4504981	4505121	It's...
4506286	4512247	It's really nice, the mock-up art scenery from the movie.
4512247	4522890	I think that's a little busy for side art myself, but it's really... I'm really impressed by it.
4522890	4524930	I really am impressed by it.
4524930	4527071	The play field looks beautiful.
4527071	4529691	There are tons of figures all over it.
4529691	4530952	Like, we even have a...
4533663	4536266	Ludo, Jennifer Connelly, Sordidimus,
4552855	4558139	You know, with that disturbing song and that whole business.
4558139	4559820	Creepy.
4559820	4563223	They have like little pop up heads in the table.
4563223	4567165	And it's it's it's a beautiful thing.
4567165	4570728	I one of Dan's friends already ordered one.
4573655	4575836	Yeah, it looks it looks really good.
4575836	4577396	I like the way the table looks.
4577396	4581937	Sorry, I was trying to show a shot on stream, but I got the wrong trailer.
4581937	4584618	But I finally found at least an image of what that looks like there.
4584618	4590719	It's obviously Bowie very heavily featured in the artwork as DarkSakura was kind of saying there with the big video screen and all that stuff.
4590719	4592539	So it looks the table does look gorgeous.
4592539	4596360	It's not to mention the songs from the movie are in it.
4596360	4598241	Yeah, that's awesome.
4598241	4600821	So I'm I'm stoked.
4600821	4602862	Yeah, I'm and I'm sure
4605127	4616519	I thought I read something about Toby, the guy that played the baby, who's now a puppeteer himself.
4616519	4619142	He was involved with it too, but I'd have to go back and look.
4619142	4624348	But yeah, I'm totally, totally down.
4625378	4631366	I should address this comment here because I'm sure many people that have seen this table were curious about this.
4631366	4638676	DarkTetsuya says, I'm guessing the guy from Southern Fried Game Expo, I forget his name but I did see it mentioned on Twitter, is probably going to have to retire his custom table.
4642780	4649625	I feel like that still remains what it always was, a fan project and fan love that brought that.
4649625	4659492	And honestly, one could even argue that maybe the visibility that came with that getting all the press may have, who knows, led to what we're seeing now.
4659492	4661554	So I think that still plays an important role.
4662194	4665375	But are you gonna see him charging people to play that table?
4665375	4667516	No, that he was not gonna be able to do, but he never did.
4667516	4668497	Or try to sell it.
4668497	4670037	But yeah, he never did.
4670037	4672438	It was a thing that was at expos.
4672438	4675239	It was a, you know, passion project type of thing.
4675239	4677701	So that's, and that's where that will remain.
4677701	4680862	I would assume that table still has a place next year.
4681402	4689864	It's still a very to see that somebody hand painted a table and converted like that still is a piece of art in its own way.
4689864	4692545	And to me, these two things can coexist.
4692545	4702428	Yes, it's hard not to bring that up in light of, you know, this this news, but I still say that just remains what it is, a really incredible fan project.
4703880	4718886	Well, and there are so many there are so many modded tables that go to conventions and whatnot, people who've done their own theming of them that it like and even companies are doing it with their own tables, putting out different skins for them.
4718886	4726008	Like I know the Halloween table is also the same one for.
4726008	4727029	I don't remember.
4727029	4731050	It's the same as another one, and I don't remember what it is.
4731050	4732271	Halloween.
4732271	4733131	I'll look it up.
4733131	4733311	All right.
4734440	4735020	Ultraman.
4735020	4737901	That's right.
4737901	4741583	I played them both in the same expo.
4741583	4742263	All right.
4742263	4748745	Well, let's move on from pinball to Loki, one of your favorite games that you create a lot of content about.
4748745	4749406	Loki.
4749406	4749966	Yes.
4749966	4751126	Minecraft Live was today.
4751126	4754587	So that's basically kind of like the Nintendo Direct of Minecraft.
4754587	4755248	Kind of.
4755248	4757529	They do different announcements.
4757529	4759409	They talk about the next update.
4759409	4763751	So because of the merger, World of Warcraft will now be playable in Minecraft.
4763751	4763931	Yes.
4765013	4771291	uh no no announcement of that yet yet um
4772021	4777403	They did announce some more DLC regarding Star Wars and Minecraft.
4777403	4780885	So they do these like DLC map things every once in a while.
4780885	4787808	So now there's going to be a brand new one that's coming out that's based around it's Star Wars Path of the Jedi.
4787808	4792009	And it's coming on the marketplace November 7th.
4792009	4797452	And you'll be able to play as a Padawan during the Clone Wars.
4797452	4798972	And you get to do all that kind of stuff.
4798972	4799452	It looked pretty cool.
4801296	4808098	There was, of course, they talked about Planet Earth, you know, that thing that's coming out from the BBC.
4808098	4810239	They're doing DLC with that as well.
4810239	4812740	They did one for the second one as well.
4812740	4815301	On top of that, other announcements.
4815301	4819602	So Minecraft is turning 15 years old next year.
4819602	4822163	So there's going to be some interesting things with that.
4822163	4826184	They've also sold 300 million copies of the game.
4826184	4827085	So a few, you know.
4828865	4836710	And along with that, of course, there's going to be the new update, so 1.21 coming out next year.
4836710	4843415	Some of the things that we got to see with that, they announced a brand new structure called a Trial Dungeon.
4844636	4851823	And with that they've got these trial spawners that spawn unique monsters based on the number of players that you have around.
4851823	4858650	And one of those is a new monster called the Breeze, which it blows air and it's kind of like an air elemental type thing.
4859250	4863071	and it has some cool interactions with like redstone stuff.
4863071	4865292	Auto-crafting is coming to the game.
4865292	4884717	So they're going to have a thing called the Crafter which allows you to actually set recipes and feed blocks into it and they'll actually craft up other items so you can incorporate that into automatic farms and stuff to help either compress some of the drops that you get or to make whatever.
4884717	4885598	So lots of creative things.
4885598	4886598	This game plays itself.
4887569	4916138	It doesn't play itself but like people make a lot of automated farms like I have a gold farm for example that I just built and it drops gold nuggets and gold nuggets take up a lot of space so you can compress those down into ingots which you know it takes nine nuggets to one ingot and then you can compress that down into blocks which nine ingots to a block so you can have that all done automatically so your storage isn't like full and you don't have to sit there you know sorting gold nuggets into a crafting bench
4916890	4920391	for I think it takes me like 10 minutes.
4920391	4923152	It's a long time after an AFK session.
4923152	4925293	So there's all that stuff you can do.
4925293	4928954	Plus, there's some of the crafting recipes like the dispenser.
4928954	4932495	You can't really mass create those.
4932495	4935296	So you could do that as well with this.
4935296	4940237	New copper and new tough blocks are going to be added to the game as well.
4940237	4942578	And there was a mob vote between
4944910	4957541	a penguin crab and armadillo in the armadillo one so we get an armadillo well justice for penguin it exactly i voted penguin i voted because you're a man of taste
4958301	4959422	Yes, exactly.
4959422	4965606	The reason why the armadillo vote, so there's different gameplay elements that come along with the mob.
4965606	4973291	So the crab is going to drop a claw that allows you to reach farther and place blocks and pickup blocks further away.
4973291	4981076	The armadillo gives you, it drops scoot, which you can be crafted into dog armor and people love their dogs.
4982977	4987600	And then the penguin allowed your boats to go faster.
4987600	4989701	I thought it was cool because the penguins are cute.
4989701	4991963	They were like clumsy on land.
4991963	4993844	They would fall down a lot, which was cool.
4993844	4995205	They gave it the worst ability.
4995205	4995985	That's what that's.
4995985	4996406	Yeah.
4996406	4999207	And so that's what that's what it came down to is people.
4999207	5004051	People vote based off of the gameplay element, not what the creature is.
5004051	5006552	So, yeah, Armadillo is fine.
5006552	5007853	That was my second choice.
5007853	5008634	Crab was kind of.
5009597	5010197	dumb.
5010197	5023080	Honestly, like the argument I've been making is like, oh, I wish it should if we've gotten crab how long until we have just oodles and oodles of YouTubes with people reenacting crab crab rave in Minecraft, right?
5023080	5031122	No, that would have had to have been incorporated into the game because they have it where you can play like music discs for paint or not pick was up for parrots and they'll dance.
5031122	5035543	So of course, they should have just enabled that for crabs.
5035543	5035763	But
5036793	5061799	yeah i mean the the argument like one of the big things that people were pushing this year is stop the mob vote which they don't want the mob vote as it is and and i agree the way it should be is that these mobs are being developed and it's like hey we're gonna put out these mobs you know in the next couple updates which one do you want first you know we'll develop this one first and then you get all three that's how it should be but instead they're like
5062675	5070299	Well, you know, we'll just put these other ones in our logs somewhere and eventually maybe come to the game.
5070299	5072180	Like they said that they did that with the frogs.
5072180	5079044	Honestly, I don't remember ever having a mob vote with a frog, but allegedly that's what they said.
5079044	5082406	And that was the only example of mobs that they've, you know,
5083412	5085453	thrown aside for different things.
5085453	5086654	And I don't agree with that.
5086654	5097641	I think that if you're going to, you know, incorporate some of these things, like, for example, was it a couple mob votes ago, they had the Glow Squid, the Moobloom, and the Ice Ologer.
5097641	5101664	Two of those, actually, all three of those came from other games.
5101664	5104846	So two of them from Minecraft Earth, one from Minecraft Dungeons.
5104846	5109989	All the models in the voice, you know, lines and sound effects and stuff are all done already.
5109989	5111370	Like, you have those models.
5111370	5112571	They are literally sitting on
5113031	5121657	a vast library of, you know, mob models that are just out there and they just don't want to spend the time to incorporate them into the game.
5121657	5127722	Like modders were already, day one, when these were announced, already had them functional in the game.
5127722	5135067	It's like, you can't tell me that, like, your team of developers can't put these in the game, all three of them.
5135067	5137789	Like, it's going to be too much manpower to do that.
5137789	5140271	I don't believe that one bit.
5140271	5141592	So, I don't know.
5143228	5149894	I like to, at least this update, there's something I'm excited about with the different, the new structures and the automatic crafting.
5149894	5154558	Whereas the last update was like, I'm not really excited about any of it.
5154558	5162325	Um, so I, you know, I say it was better than last year, but I think that the mob vote really needs to be retooled.
5163605	5165286	All right, but that's right.
5165286	5168389	We need to just stuff the ballot box for Penguin next time.
5168389	5169910	That's how it needs to be.
5169910	5171010	I tried.
5171010	5172832	I tried voting Penguin, but you know.
5173434	5174394	You didn't send me the link.
5174394	5175195	I didn't vote Penguin.
5175195	5176475	That's fine.
5176475	5177895	All right.
5177895	5178816	Let's talk about this story.
5178816	5181877	A lot of folks in our Discord were talking about this story earlier this week.
5181877	5189259	If you want to join the discussion during the week, you sure can over at vognetwork.com slash discord, especially there being no live show next week.
5189259	5194461	If you want to talk to us about news that breaks next week, I would highly encourage you to do that over at our Discord server.
5194461	5197182	Again, vognetwork.com slash discord.
5197182	5200243	And I don't know how many of you heard about this, but there was a limited time
5200663	5203906	Pokemon Trading Card for the game that was released.
5203906	5209990	It was Pokemon Cross Van Gogh called Pikachu with Gray Felt Hat.
5209990	5218397	It was a take on a very similar piece of work by Vince Van Gogh, which I'm going to show there on the other screen there.
5218397	5223480	So for folks that are looking on our Twitch channel, you can see how, yes, it's very inspired there.
5223480	5229365	It actually kind of looks like one of those AI things, but this was done by an actual person, I'm assuming.
5231706	5238909	And of course it sold out instantly because people flooded the museum.
5238909	5244651	There's chaotic scenes of what this looked like at a museum, mind you, the Van Gogh Museum.
5244651	5249093	There's just what chaos looks like all over YouTube.
5249093	5253635	It looked like Toys R Us on Black Friday back in the day where people were
5254055	5257496	You know, jumping on top of each other to get Cabbage Patch Kids and all this stuff.
5257496	5259437	It's just wild.
5259437	5260637	And that's what was happening here.
5260637	5264398	People were climbing over each other to get whatever merchandise they could.
5264398	5265478	And why?
5265478	5266959	Because it was being scalped.
5266959	5271320	Scalper, scalper, scalpers trying to buy it up so that they can go profit off of that online.
5272322	5280630	Pokemon Company has revealed you can still get this item via the Pokemon Center website.
5280630	5282653	On the website, they announced this.
5282653	5287297	What will happen is that the promo card, if you do one Pokemon Center order,
5290100	5293103	containing a Pokemon trading card game product.
5293103	5298708	While supplies last, you can get one Pikachu with gray felt hat promo card.
5298708	5304673	So they're basically having to shift it all online because people don't know how to act right in person.
5304673	5306514	And scalpers are going to scalp.
5306514	5310237	And I know there's a lot of people that are quick to blame the scalpers.
5310237	5310978	And I get it.
5310978	5312019	You should.
5312019	5316163	The people that really need to be blamed are the people that buy from scalpers.
5317190	5322996	Um, that because it's only enabling all of this behavior and putting the stuff into it.
5322996	5323877	And I get it.
5323877	5328381	There's always going to be people with that kind of money to spend that are going to pay the premium for it.
5328381	5330263	But to me, that's where the blame lies.
5330263	5338371	It's the people that are buying and to some extent, it's places like eBay where this shit thrives and goes unchecked completely.
5338371	5338451	Um,
5339452	5344418	but it's whatever I realized it's a it's a very large kind of problem to take on.
5344418	5349483	But yeah, the whole thing just to kind of see that go down in a museum is really, really gross.
5349483	5350564	And it's sad.
5350564	5359854	I I also kind of hope it's a lesson learned in a way like I'm sometimes I wonder does Pokemon not understand how popular they are?
5359854	5360315	They know.
5361270	5379750	but but when things like this happen or like when Pokemon go even first launched on mobile phones in 2016 and it was like it was so popular it was screwed up like do they not know how popular Pokemon is sometimes I wonder it's just I mean it's it's not a bad problem to have but
5381271	5387893	SG100 Matt says, honestly, they probably wouldn't do these trading card things again because of it, which hurts everyone.
5387893	5392714	MikeDef says, they know, but for some reason they lack the logistics for this kind of stuff.
5392714	5398256	Well, because they gave it to the museum to do, but the museum also lacks the logistics for this stuff.
5398256	5405578	MikeDef says, granted, after that first day, the thing got under control, but there were people outside the museum harassing people that came out
5406018	5409639	to buy the card and made it pretty uncomfortable for visitors.
5409639	5412760	It's like the people fucking outside a concert.
5412760	5414741	Do you have any tickets to sell?
5414741	5416941	No, I'm fucking here to see the show.
5416941	5420462	I don't have tickets to sell.
5420462	5429865	Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when you know video games weren't things we were going to see in a museum anytime soon in this next segment.
5440608	5448313	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5448313	5451575	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5451575	5456078	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the Classic Game this week?
5456078	5461001	I picked Dragon Ball Z's Super Butouden 2.
5461001	5463962	I picked the second one on purpose, because I like it better than the first one.
5466083	5474449	It's a game that came out in 1993, developed by Tose and published by Bandai for the Super Famicom.
5474449	5483196	It's based, of course, off of the Dragon Ball franchise and is the sequel to Dragon Ball Z's Super Butoden that came out earlier that year for Super Famicom.
5484197	5489160	This one is cooler because it is The Cell Game.
5489160	5497866	This is probably one of the better story arcs, although, dear lord, it still went on for freaking ever.
5497866	5506451	And also has some of the movie characters that came out around the same time, like the Borori and Bojack movies.
5508942	5513283	But anyway, it uses a six-button configuration to play with.
5513283	5517244	You have special moves and different playable modes.
5517244	5521104	And it's done by the same team.
5521104	5523645	And it really improves on the previous one.
5523645	5528086	So it brings in the tournament mode and has more characters.
5528086	5538408	And it really is considered, while it's similar to Super Butoden, it's a little bit, I'd say, it's better.
5539068	5547032	Now, the pinnacle of that era was Super Butouden 3, but I'm saving that for another day.
5547032	5564941	Anyway, the Super Butouden 2, one of the neat things about it, and this is actually a fairly common thing for the Dragon Ball games, is this sort of split-screen thing that happens when the characters are far apart.
5568076	5582448	The whole point of it is to give this sense of distance and feeling and, you know, you have your aerial attacks and your ground attacks and of course when you're closer together, you know, the little divider goes away.
5582448	5589453	You've got all kinds of neat special moves that are basically related to their moves in the series.
5592809	5602814	And so, you know, it's one of the ways that you can just get a little bit more of that epic feel that the show is known for.
5602814	5607876	You also have water arenas that are added for this one.
5607876	5611538	You have counterattack specials.
5611538	5618301	You have meteor combos for consecutive attacks.
5618301	5620742	In the previous game, only Goku had that.
5622903	5636504	But at any rate, the people who worked on it had some funny nicknames like JC Pajama.
5636504	5637505	I thought that was funny.
5637505	5637886	That's good.
5640512	5645856	But the game was a real big success.
5645856	5660406	It was released in Japan on December 17th, 1993, and they actually did release it in Europe in April 1994, and then published in June 1994 by Bandai.
5660406	5667311	In French, it was Dragon Ball Z Legend Slayer, as in Saiyajin Legend.
5668953	5679387	There was an album of the music that was published in Japan by Columbia Records and had arranged versions of some of the songs.
5679387	5684454	There was an English version for Latin America that had been made and never released.
5685956	5696964	In 2015, the Japanese version of Super Butouden 2 was included as a pre-order bonus for Dragon Ball Z Extreme Butouden for Nintendo 3DS.
5696964	5703930	And that was for people who ordered in the UK through Game or in the US through Amazon that had a code for the title.
5703930	5707112	And this was its first official release in the United States.
5708433	5713656	The game was at the top of Famitsu's charts in December 1993.
5713656	5722961	It was a success, lifetime sales between 1.15 million according to Famitsu, and 1.2 million units alone in Japan.
5722961	5724002	Or in Japan alone, sorry.
5725703	5727845	had really good music.
5727845	5734411	To this day, Trunks' theme is like the best music in any video game ever.
5734411	5741036	I don't care what anyone says, it's like one of the best ever pieces of music in a game.
5741036	5748063	And yeah, so it's also the first Dragon Ball game I ever owned.
5749203	5750784	and I have a story about it.
5750784	5768751	I traded my entire VHS run of Gyver that I had at the time for the entire Cell Game fan subbed and Super Butouden 2 and Super Butouden together.
5768751	5771492	And then I was the cool kid that had the Dragon Ball games in the 90s.
5773006	5776467	Of course, well before, you know.
5776467	5780509	I was totally into... I hate to do the hipster thing.
5780509	5783250	I was in Dragon Ball Z when it was only on Japan.
5783250	5784671	But I was totally into it.
5784671	5786031	Like, that was my jam.
5786031	5789332	That and Sailor Moon and Ranma 1.5.
5789332	5796255	Those were the holy trinity of anime back then.
5796255	5800517	And... Oh, that series got me through my first couple years of college.
5803048	5805832	Yeah, but I still have my copies.
5805832	5807935	I love them.
5807935	5817048	Of course, I think the biggest one that was supposed to have eclipsed them was Hyperdimension that came out much later, but I'll be talking about those at some point in the future.
5818001	5819742	All right.
5819742	5822745	Just reading some comments from chat here, remembering this game.
5822745	5827388	Sjohn100mat says, this was a must have when ROM downloading was a thing.
5827388	5832492	And OrangeWrite says, definitely check this game out during my introduction to SNES emulation.
5832492	5835795	Remember to delete the ROM after 24 hours.
5835795	5836655	And I'm just laughing.
5836655	5841299	It's like, how did anybody ever believe that legally that was a thing?
5841299	5846603	Well, and to answer OrangeWrite on here, I also had a Dragon Ball GT Final Bout.
5847822	5854647	And I wish I had kept it when I did because it ended up being worth a lot more money until it got a re-release.
5854647	5864074	But I traded my copy of that game for Blue Stinger on Dreamcast, the Japanese one.
5864074	5867957	And honestly, Blue Stinger was a better game.
5867957	5869078	All right.
5869078	5869838	Well, there you go.
5869838	5873181	I can say I beat Blue Stinger like three times.
5873181	5876403	There's your classic game of the week.
5879032	5886557	Well, we saw more show to come at you here, including some other headline stories in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
5886557	5888918	So we'll talk about them quickly because it's rapid fire.
5888918	5890399	Loki.
5890399	5900145	Yeah, this is kind of strange, but Microsoft Flight Simulator is getting some new DLC for the Juice Goose.
5900145	5901746	Now, what's the juice?
5901746	5902987	What's the Juice Goose?
5902987	5905088	It is some sort of ATV.
5907182	5912324	So you may be wondering, well, what's that have to do with Microsoft Flight Simulator?
5912324	5914625	And honestly, I don't know.
5914625	5925410	But apparently it is something that you can get for $15 and it's actually it's like allows you to drive it.
5925410	5925510	Hmm.
5926218	5936952	and like go off jumps and go like drive it in the dunes and stuff so it's kind of weird to see Microsoft Flight Simulator to have like driving sim stuff in there as well.
5936952	5943440	Well, it's less weird when you consider this is a third party mod and Flight Sim is enabled for the sale of third party mods.
5943940	5946502	So that makes it less weird.
5946502	5963576	But I will say, you know, I am interested in this because I, you know, the flight sim, the graphics are so incredible in that game and the way, you know, it generates the actual real world based off of, you know, existing satellite imagery and all that stuff, which I haven't played the game in a while.
5963576	5970282	I wonder if they've updated it because there's a lot of newer areas in my part of town that, you know, are just fields.
5970742	5971483	Thanks for watching!
5988044	5989405	Yeah, I check it out.
5989405	5992028	I think 15 bucks is a little expensive.
5992028	5993930	Just when I don't know what I'm getting into.
5993930	6005842	But if there's if there's some really good like trailers of other people playing it not not like a super cut trailer, but like actual gameplay from a streamer or somebody check I would they could maybe sway me.
6005842	6008205	I'd be very curious what it looked like.
6008205	6010467	Yeah.
6010467	6010627	Anyway,
6011031	6019112	And then along with that, I'm very excited because Earth Defense Force 6 is being localized for North America.
6019112	6019613	Spring 2024.
6019613	6023693	It's coming out on PlayStation 5 and PC.
6023693	6027314	And I cannot wait because I love me some Earth Defense Force.
6027314	6030955	It is a trashy game and.
6030955	6034375	And I eat that trash up.
6034375	6037356	I'm very happy for you, Loki.
6037356	6039276	All right, let's move on, DarkSakura.
6040423	6046086	So there's a game called Spin Rhythm XD coming out on Switch.
6046086	6054170	It'll be out October 26th, my brother's birthday, the good brother, with also its first DLC.
6054170	6058312	Right now it's available on a computer.
6058312	6061774	Super Spin Digital is releasing it.
6061774	6063494	The orders are up as of October 19th.
6065816	6070458	But it's already been on Early Access on Steam.
6070458	6085067	As far as songs that will be in the first DLC, just all name a couple, Crazy by Tokyo Machine, It's All Over by Shock One, Overkill by Riot, a few of those songs.
6087199	6095964	But it's like a kinetic music game and it has over 60 licensed and original tracks in the game already.
6095964	6100166	So it looks pretty.
6100166	6103088	Yeah, kind of.
6103088	6105889	Spinny guitar hero-ish.
6105889	6114774	Yeah, this game was a GDQ the last time around, and Alan streamed this before, so it's yeah, it's it's for music game stuff.
6114774	6115835	It's pretty it's pretty cool.
6115835	6116235	I like it.
6116235	6116475	It's cute.
6117144	6118465	Me.
6118465	6122889	Alright, moving on, talking about Windjammers 2.
6122889	6124470	There is going to be a free update.
6124470	6126172	It's coming out for Windjammers 2.
6126172	6128414	It adds new playable characters.
6128414	6135400	Jamma GX-03, an android with well-balanced power and speed, and Anna Salinski.
6135400	6145108	There's also going to be new modes added to the game, lessons mode and practice modes, as well as some new online features, including creating a lobby, which seems like a very basic thing.
6145108	6145288	But
6145648	6147709	The big thing is crossplay.
6147709	6156432	So now players on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation can join Steam and Xbox, who I guess were already linked, together in online matches.
6156432	6157173	So that's great.
6157173	6164435	But because of that, online ranking is being erased and going back to zero because of all this new stuff with everything that's being unleashed.
6164435	6165636	So check that out.
6165636	6167497	The update just came out.
6167497	6170858	So you can check that all out if you are a Windjammers fan.
6172265	6177427	All right, let's see what else is coming out very soon in our world release dates.
6177427	6179928	Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?
6179928	6182930	A lot of things are coming out in the U.S.
6182930	6184771	It's ramping up to that time of year.
6184771	6185691	Yeah.

6199868	6206056	A Boy and His Blob Retro Collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6206056	6208920	Like the old school NES and Game Boy versions together?
6208920	6210702	It must be.
6210702	6214527	Yeah, I'm wondering if it's also like some of the remakes as well.
6214527	6218052	Boy, they milk that franchise for money wherever they can.
6220124	6223407	It's been out a few, I think they've had a few remakes as well.
6223407	6225468	Yeah, on the Wii, they had a remake, I remember.
6225468	6231313	Yeah, so I don't know exactly what's in it, but it's a collection of Bwins blob games, so.
6231313	6234977	The Caligula Effect 2 on PlayStation 5.
6234977	6240842	Let's see, we also have Mobile Suit Gundam UC Engage on iOS and Android.

6336492	6343557	The Gap on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6343557	6348500	I have to assume that that's a clothing retailer sim.
6348500	6354805	Gargoyles Remastered on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6355737	6382235	Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Inescapable No Rules No Rescue on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series The Jackbox Party Pack 10 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series

6446925	6450107	On PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6450107	6460915	And last but not least, this seems to be contradictory, but Warm Snow on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6460915	6462216	You can't have warm snow.
6462216	6463817	Snow is cold.
6463817	6464738	That doesn't make any sense.
6466172	6468514	I thought you said worms, snow at first.
6468514	6468814	Worms, snow?
6468814	6471637	I thought they were making, oh, they're making a new worms game.
6471637	6472958	Nope, worms, snow.
6472958	6473218	All right.
6475342	6478143	Okay, let's move on to Japan and check out the release dates there.

6507236	6509257	And of course, Super Mario Bros.
6509257	6522684	Wonder, you know that's a worldwide release, and that is also coming out in Japan this week, and there are all sorts of accessories, third-party crap up the wazoo to support this release that should not be a surprise to anyone.
6522684	6524224	That is what is coming out on the Switch.
6524224	6527186	Hopping over to the PlayStation 5 and looking at the releases there,
6527638	6531439	Sonic Superstars also out in Japan.
6531439	6532939	And I believe that's it.
6532939	6542201	Oh, no, we have one other release on the 19th, Drift CE and Everspace 2 also being released in Japan.
6542201	6547362	Oh, and it does look like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will release in Japan the same time as the US.

6647162	6648563	Hello.
6648563	6650465	Sorry, I was muted and I was talking.
6650465	6656150	I was gonna say, all right, there's plenty to pick from around the world there, no matter where it is that you live.
6656150	6658953	So let's move on to some more news.
6658953	6662456	And then we will open up our phone lines and all that good stuff.
6662456	6663657	So first, Loki.
6665025	6672909	PlayStation Plus Premium is going to start allowing you to stream certain PlayStation 5 games via cloud streaming.
6672909	6679992	So they're going to be supporting, they say, hundreds of titles through this new offering.
6679992	6685215	But right now while they're beta testing it for the next couple months, they're going to have top PlayStation 5 hits.
6686095	6688716	that are available from your PlayStation Plus catalog.
6688716	6697477	So some of the games they mention Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Horizon Forbidden West, Ghost of Tsushima, Mortal Kombat 11 and Saints Row 4.
6697477	6699978	They're also going to have timed demos for certain games.
6699978	6708320	So Hogwarts Legacy, The Witcher 3 and Callisto Protocol are going to be available as like a timed demo type thing.
6710405	6719113	And then also you'll be able to stream some games that you've purchased as well, as well as some free-to-play titles.
6719113	6722576	So like Fortnite, Genshin Impact, that type of stuff.
6725582	6732103	Right now, they say that they're going to support resolutions up to 4K and 60 FPS.
6732103	6740725	And they recommend, I guess, about 38 megabits per second transfer speed in order for that to be supported.
6740725	6746886	Also, enhanced sound as well, so they're going to support different surround sound methods.
6746886	6750486	And, yeah.
6750486	6751847	Of course, the... Was it right now?
6751847	6752747	The subscription, I think, is $160.
6754912	6783493	for 12 months so it's going to be I get up from the 120 it was before or 160 for a year yeah just make sure that's clear uh it is going to be trying to give something to justify that price increase but it's still bullshit i'm sorry yeah um it's going to be a phased rollout they said starting in japan on october 17th and europe is going to be the 23rd and north america october 30th
6785098	6801426	And right now it's available in quite a few countries, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg.
6801426	6806549	I mean, there's a lot of country, a lot of the European regions, UK and US.
6806549	6807949	So.
6807949	6810230	Cool.
6810230	6810711	All right.
6810711	6811311	I don't know.
6811311	6813672	I'm not excited about it still hasn't sold me on, you know,
6815582	6816265	on all this stuff.
6817753	6821455	I feel like they're playing catch up with Game Pass right now.
6821455	6821795	Exactly.
6821795	6823476	It still doesn't justify the price increase.
6823476	6828659	I mean, yes, they're playing catch up, but it's still it's going to be half assed because they're still doing the phased rollout slow.
6828659	6835282	You know, hopefully it works well, but it's also streaming like I like I get it like streaming's cool.
6835282	6843926	In practice, streaming is a cool idea, but it just in this reality that we live in with bandwidth caps and that may not necessarily be the case in other countries.
6843926	6845707	But like in the United States, it's it's
6846407	6849890	DarkSakura, you may have the controller to do just that, right?
6862698	6866881	I am kind of on the fence about this one.
6866881	6871204	Retro-Bit has Sega Saturn Pro controllers.
6871204	6878710	So it looks like they actually have both kinds of connector on it.
6878710	6883694	It's a reproduction of the Saturn controller, which honestly, it's the one I do not prefer to use.
6883694	6887536	I prefer to use the analog controller.
6887536	6889037	But they
6891122	6895727	They actually have smaller analog controllers at the bottom center.
6895727	6908601	It just seems kind of awkward to me, but they come in the black and gray of the American one and the white and gray for the Japanese one.
6908601	6909482	It's actually the...
6911234	6916137	They just look very, very, very nice.
6916137	6924421	The compatibility is for PC, Mac, and quote, other USB enabled devices.
6924421	6928103	They... I don't know.
6928103	6930284	They're not... They don't look clunky.
6930284	6931965	They look like Saturn controllers.
6931965	6934326	They look like you could play Street Fighter with them.
6934326	6936167	So, yeah, cool.
6936167	6936387	All right.
6938097	6942758	Um, well, let's move on to some other retro style type of games.
6942758	6944939	Loki?
6944939	6954081	Um, yeah, well, I mean, retro in the sense that it, you know, we used to talk about, you know, games getting pirated before release.
6954081	6957801	And well, what do you... 2D side-scrollers, but yes.
6957801	6959222	Yeah, go fake it.
6959222	6961922	You know, a big temple title like Super Mario Bros.
6961922	6964983	Wonder has, of course, leaked online and
6967083	6970072	And Color Me Not Surprised.
6970072	6971336	So, you know.
6972705	6978149	Um, it is interesting that some gameplay video was on social media that was quickly taken down.
6978149	6982773	So Nintendo, of course, already has their legal team and fire alarms going off.
6982773	6984555	So don't don't stream this.
6984555	6988318	If you if you somehow luck into an early copy, don't do this.
6988318	6989559	Even if it's legit.
6989559	6991981	Nintendo is notorious about sharing this.
6991981	6994142	Yeah, they shut that shit down before release dates.
6994142	6999587	Definitely don't post on YouTube or anything like that because they're the Nintendo legal department's coming for you.
6999587	6999727	So
7000287	7023880	but it's not that much longer right what like five more days and then the game's finally out so yeah you can you can do it you can get there everybody all right well another game that was getting a bit a bit of chat in our discord uh which i thought was kind of funny uh was this new soccer title that's coming out from EA but it's not what you think uh it is a soccer turn by turn turn-based strategy game
7024613	7027274	EA Sports FC Tactical
7041478	7044381	Mobile titles coming out for iOS and Android in early 2024.
7044381	7054811	This is a very interesting version of the game coming out, but they're calling it, quote, authentic football action like never before.
7054811	7058295	Matches are simulated, so you don't actually control the players' actions.
7058775	7063897	Instead, you focus on strategies like player stamina and power play management.
7063897	7068479	You can do online friendly matches and what they call intense online competitions.
7068479	7072600	That's just ranked matches, leagues, guilds, all that type of stuff.
7072600	7084885	So there's some promotional screenshots out there that show like a one on one battle going on where you see the numbers that skills skill up against each other things like skills like dribbling, one, two, passing, shooting,
7085285	7090172	and maybe a skill move power up thing that you can use there.
7090172	7101627	Apparently, 5,000 licensed players from more than 10 top leagues, probably very similar to what you have in the mainline games, you can train to upgrade moves, unlock new traits, and so forth.
7102087	7111309	EA Sports FC Tactical embraces strategic gameplay to create an all-new football experience that immerses players in the world's game like never before.
7111309	7116310	That is a quote from Vice President of EA Sports, Nick Wlodicka.
7116310	7117790	I hope I said that right.
7117790	7122611	The game is available for pre-registration on iOS and Android ahead of the January 18, 2024 launch.
7126195	7130500	This may surprise you that I'm going to say this, but I think this is a great idea.
7130500	7134303	I think this is good because I think this is what a mobile soccer game should be.
7134303	7139909	I think it's good that they're not trying to recreate the arcade action and that whole sort of thing.
7139909	7141971	They're doing something that makes sense.
7142632	7144113	for mobile.
7144113	7146815	And I don't think this is the first time EA has done this before.
7146815	7148657	Yeah, ZenMonkey11 points this out in chat.
7148657	7151599	I was going to say, I thought they did one for American football.
7151599	7153000	This has been done a few years back.
7153000	7154521	It's called Football Tactics.
7154521	7156783	Oh, I guess it was turn-based soccer at the time.
7156783	7160545	I thought there was an American football one too, but, and it's brilliant.
7160545	7162627	It's on console and PC.
7162627	7167851	So, which, I mean, I think it's interesting.
7167851	7169752	I mean, it's just a different type of
7170968	7173650	kind of fancy strategy type of game.
7173650	7174810	I don't see anything wrong.
7174810	7179373	I mean, I think people are just like, wait, it's a soccer game, but you're doing it like strategy.
7179373	7180534	Yeah, why not?
7180534	7184596	Like, it's different, and I don't like it.
7184596	7187478	I think it makes a lot of sense for mobile.
7187478	7193081	It makes a lot, a lot of sense for mobile, and takes my biggest complaint about mobile games and removes it.
7193481	7199446	ZenMonkey11 wants to point out the game he was talking about was a game that is not connected to EA, it was made by an indie dev, and was part of Early Access.
7199446	7200387	Thank you for clarifying.
7224003	7225984	That was our last story that we had slotted.
7225984	7233726	Okay, then we're going to get to the listener roundtable where we invite your phone calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
7233726	7235967	But we also invite your emails.
7235967	7240229	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.
7240229	7241809	I believe we have one tonight.
7241809	7242409	Yep.
7242409	7244250	Let's do it.
7244250	7245290	Hello, LR.
7245290	7249072	I just wanted to chime in on a couple of things you mentioned last week.
7249072	7250772	Hi, YYR.
7250772	7251813	I always know from the greeting.
7253738	7256901	The new release of Astro Smash was mentioned.
7256901	7263828	Yes, the new version of Astro Smash released last week on Steam, Xbox, and Switch.
7263828	7267231	And you might have assumed that Intellivision Entertainment was behind this release.
7267231	7273518	However, if you look at the fine print, you will see that both the developer and publisher listed as BBG Entertainment.
7273518	7273858	Who?
7273858	7274739	Who is this, you might ask?
7276130	7285074	BBG Entertainment is a small developer based in Germany that claims to have more than 10 employees and freelancers, according to their website.
7285074	7294398	Its founder and president had started a mobile game developer in 2001, became successful enough in 2005, it was purchased by Disney.
7294398	7300701	Currently, BBG seems to have based its business on acquiring classic IPs and releasing new versions of these games.
7300701	7304563	In 2017, for example, they acquired the rights for Boulder Dash.
7306091	7324366	In May of this year, BBG announced that they had successfully acquired the IPs of both Astro Smash and Shark Shark, two of the most popular Intellivision games of all time.
7324366	7332313	The agreement specifies that Intellivision Entertainment retain the ability to self-release future versions of these games on their own consoles if they are released.
7332793	7344039	but otherwise gives BBG everything else, so if you choose to drop $15 on either the new Astra Smash or Shark Shark, know that your money is going to BBG, not Intellivision Entertainment.
7348030	7354455	That being said, the games themselves are clearly identical gameplay-wise to the versions that would have released on Amico.
7354455	7363442	If you compare Intellivision's own Deep Dive videos from some time ago with the trailers for the 2023 BBG releases, they look exactly the same.
7363442	7366124	Just to weigh in, I think this whole thing is pretty sad.
7366124	7374390	Intellivision Entertainment, or what's left of it, is apparently so desperate to stay afloat that they are getting rid of their only thing of value, their IPs.
7375445	7381988	Remember that wonderful Intellivision Lives collection on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC?
7381988	7388731	Well, if there's going to be anything like that in the future, they will be missing those two games because they don't even own them anymore.
7388731	7390532	Sigh.
7390532	7395394	Now, excuse me while I place a pre-order for a DDR machine I can actually fit into my apartment.
7396596	7401620	Regarding that amazing looking DDR mini cabinet, there are a few tidbits you might have missed.
7401620	7406724	One, they will be announcing more songs for it over the coming months, including licenses.
7406724	7417772	Two, you can use it to play the overpriced but arcade perfect DDR Grand Prix on PC, which I intend to do for double charts as I have no room for two stages.
7418780	7427303	It's being built by the same folks behind the Taito E-Grit 2 Mini and the Sega Astro City Minis, which means it's going to look and feel amazing.
7427303	7431664	If you're outside of Japan, you can use a proxy service like Tenso.com to order one.
7431664	7437926	These services will give you a virtual Japanese address and then forward stuff onto you.
7437926	7439807	They're reasonably priced and work very well.
7439807	7442268	I think there's also Rakuten I think will do it.
7443649	7446751	The US dollar is worth more against the Japanese yen right now.
7446751	7449073	One dollar is worth 150 yen.
7449073	7452996	So if you are going to order this thing, now would be a great time to do it.
7452996	7454458	So anyway, thanks for the show.
7454458	7455899	Enjoy your week off and be well.
7455899	7457540	Don't be sick for three weeks like me.
7457540	7457941	Oops.
7457941	7458661	Cough, cough.
7458661	7459222	Erin YYR.
7460083	7463844	I think it's like $299 is what it ends up being US.
7463844	7468465	It's still pretty pricey, but yeah, I mean, I get it for the hardcore DDR fans.
7468465	7475827	You know, it's especially the fact that you can actually put a stage in it and, you know, it works with DDR PC and all that stuff.
7475827	7476268	Yeah.
7476268	7482309	Well, I don't know if you saw, but like they did add some new songs as I heard they did get some licenses after all.
7482309	7482529	Yeah.
7482529	7483049	Yeah.
7483049	7484610	We got you got Captain Jack.
7484610	7487991	So we got Captain Jack Grindale and the race.
7487991	7488191	So.
7490443	7491884	Make a jam, let them move.
7491884	7494446	Gotta have let them move, you know, and get up and move.
7494446	7495867	No, we don't have to have that.
7495867	7499189	Well, apparently you're gonna have it if they're force feeding it to you.
7499189	7509276	So, you know, they did make their goal like within three hours, they said, and it's still gonna be up for another 43 days.
7509276	7510697	It looks it's cool.
7510697	7511998	Yeah, it's a lot of
7514762	7527887	I actually want to go back real quick to the Intellivision part because I actually did figure Intellivision themselves did not put this out on Switch because I don't think Intellivision was making any games in-house.
7527887	7534569	I think they were contracting with organizations and that type of contract that you outlined there makes a lot of sense.
7534569	7537190	You make the game and we're going to sell it as us.
7537830	7542251	But if we relinquish those rights, then you can sell it as yourselves, which is what is happening here.
7542251	7550694	Basically, I am actually surprised and a little bit stunned that Intellivision does not get a cut of those sales.
7550694	7554655	Because that means, what do they get out of this besides a one-time fee?
7555934	7566883	to pay creditors by selling off what is one of the biggest in television exclusives, which are few and far between.
7566883	7569685	They get the dink smell of desperation.
7569685	7572647	Well, yeah, it's just unfortunate.
7572647	7578432	I mean, it's nice that the game developers can get a little bit of something, something back, you know, and have it out there in the world, I guess.
7578432	7583576	But I am not expecting to be blown away by Astro Smash.
7583576	7584497	Let's just put it that way.
7585117	7586758	like, you know, we'll see.
7586758	7599989	I'll, you know, like I said about another game earlier on, instead of a sizzle reel, I'll watch a streamer or a YouTuber, like a real person that hopefully I know, actually play the game and kind of give some thoughts there before I make up my mind on it.
7599989	7605854	But I'm not I'm not expecting a lot to be quite honest.
7605854	7610618	But it's, you know, yeah, it is it is kind of sad what happened.
7610618	7613220	It's very obvious the Amico is never coming out at this point.
7614750	7617310	So it's what it is.
7617310	7620731	It's just very sad that this is now what Intellivision's legacy is.
7620731	7622731	It's sad.
7622731	7625152	Yeah.
7625152	7625832	All right.
7625832	7629193	But I mean, you know what's interesting?
7629193	7637134	For better or for worse, that former CEO got raped through the coals harder on the internet than Bobby Kotick probably did.
7637134	7640775	I just think that's interesting.
7640775	7641875	I'm not here to defend
7643272	7647276	anything, but I just I just think that's interesting.
7647276	7654903	It's all I'm getting that where people will spend their time and money and who they're going to direct their anger to in the gaming world.
7654903	7657726	I just think it's interesting.
7657726	7659668	All right.
7659668	7661089	Hmm.
7661089	7668096	Well, with that, I think we are to the point where I can go around and ask if there are any last minute stories to share tonight.
7668096	7668276	Yes.
7670514	7694642	So apparently there was a Tekken 7 tournament part of EGX 2023 and apparently this anti-oil protest group called Just Stop Oil decided to interrupt the finale by spreading paint on the monitors of the two people competing and spraying the stage with water guns.
7695655	7711107	Once again, I would like to, you know, remind a lot of these, um, tournaments, um, or presentation, you know, in the, these different events in the gaming industry, you gotta up your security, man.
7711107	7715670	Like someone's going to get killed in one of these things, you know, sure.
7715670	7725057	They're protesting and spraying paint, but who let them into an event anyways with paint in the first place or a water gun, like,
7727638	7730040	What kind of security do you guys have at these events?
7730040	7730981	It's ridiculous.
7730981	7733803	Like, I get it.
7733803	7736846	You know, anti-oil is fine, you know, if you want to protest it.
7736846	7739008	But like, what does that have to do with Tekken 7?
7739008	7743792	Like, are the people that are like playing Tekken like pro-oil?
7743792	7745113	I don't think so.
7745113	7749076	It's just, it seems like a really weird thing.
7749076	7749217	So.
7752352	7753132	Um, yeah.
7753132	7761794	And, uh, as pointed out in chat, the, uh, group that did this is the same group that did this, uh, with the Van Gogh, you know, painting and all this stuff.
7761794	7766395	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says they want you to talk about it and doing it at a tech and event did it.
7766395	7774156	I mean, I suppose, yeah, that's all attention is good attention type of things, but I guess I, I don't know.
7774156	7778477	I know in the case of the internet trolls, that's especially the case, but yeah.
7779865	7782346	I have to respond to this comment too on something we were saying earlier.
7782346	7786328	So YYR in chat said, Kotick was a jerk, but not a liar.
7786328	7789750	Tommy basically lied about absolutely everything.
7789750	7794272	I know your comment is well intentioned, but I'm sorry, Bobby Kotick was absolutely a liar.
7794272	7798114	Every time he covered up, he lied to the public every day.
7798514	7800776	about what was really going on at that company.
7800776	7804739	He lied in hiding the abuse that was happening towards the employees.
7804739	7808062	All of that that he was doing by covering it up, that was a lie.
7808062	7816029	And that lie was far worse than blowing smoke up our ass because you got screwed over by a Chinese chip company, which is what happened to Tommy Tallarico.
7816029	7820272	Again, not excusing Tommy's behavior and all of that.
7820272	7821954	I want to make that very clear.
7821954	7825376	But when I kind of put the who sinned more,
7826337	7828778	I agree with Bobby.
7828778	7829918	I don't think Tommy lied.
7829918	7832459	I think he really believed he would deliver what he said.
7832459	7834220	And I would actually agree with that.
7834220	7838461	He always just seems to be a really sincere, earnest person.
7838461	7839882	But foolish.
7839882	7840422	Yeah, but foolish.
7841467	7843809	and YYR says I sit corrected.
7843809	7844770	Thank you.
7844770	7845651	I knew you would get it.
7845651	7848193	So that's that's why I'm not yelling or raising my voice.
7848193	7851096	I'm just outlining.
7851096	7857241	And SheHulk10 going back to the story on the protesters saying they are looking for low security opportunities to protest.
7857241	7858322	Yeah, they're looking for it.
7858322	7859743	They're looking for those opportunities.
7859743	7860964	Don't give them the opportunity.
7860964	7863627	If one person exploits it, someone else is going to exploit it worse.
7863627	7864027	That's right.
7865958	7874740	All right, well, hopefully, well, we know TwitchCon has some, Bobby was talking about the bag policy at TwitchCon, which I didn't even realize.
7874740	7881342	They have a super strict bag policy at TwitchCon, which, I mean, in light of what we are just talking about just now, good.
7881342	7885203	Like, I'm glad to hear that TwitchCon's taking safety seriously, so.
7885203	7887403	Please stay away from the foam pits.
7887403	7889404	Like, anybody that's going to TwitchCon, stay away from the foam pits.
7889404	7892084	Crocs is having a pit.
7892084	7894165	Crocs, the shoemakers, are gonna be there?
7894165	7894385	Yes.
7895265	7895866	Yes.
7895866	7898948	I have so many questions and not enough answers.
7898948	7900750	No, I... They're comfortable.
7900750	7903032	I am in my mid-40s.
7903032	7905914	Any sort of those physical challenges?
7905914	7907655	No.
7907655	7910117	No, I am too damn old.
7910117	7913460	I actually think I want to do one this year.
7913460	7914281	Have fun.
7914281	7915101	I want to jowl.
7915101	7917403	I'll be cheering you down below.
7917403	7921387	I need to practice my balance whenever I can.
7921387	7923088	So I think that I...
7924743	7930405	I'm going to put my training to use by knocking people off of a platform for prizes.
7930405	7934446	Just, you better feel around that pit to make sure it's foamy enough.
7934446	7936366	If your back should hit it, just be careful.
7936366	7938247	I just won't fall into it.
7938247	7939927	She jumped off too, remember?
7939927	7942728	Oh yeah, but still, still.
7942728	7942908	Yeah.
7944518	7945919	All right, let's see.
7945919	7956026	Oh, SSU 100 Matt in chat says, Rob, I gotta ask, what did you think of the videos of the Swifties in the movie theater for the new heiress tour movie?
7956026	7959288	NPR was calling it the new shadow cast movie.
7959288	7960109	You know, it's funny.
7960109	7969356	So I was hosting a show last night and, you know, at these shows in between acts, I often tell jokes and I don't write a lot of jokes in advance.
7969356	7970797	I don't consider myself a joke writer.
7971397	7976202	But I'm definitely somebody who outlines bullet points and then I talk about stories, basically.
7976202	7982768	And by the way, the theme of last night's event that we did was called The Silver Scream.
7982768	7985371	It was Cabaret Macabre, The Silver Scream.
7985371	7989995	And I'm actually trying to pull up my Instagram stories real fast because I know not all of you are on Instagram.
7989995	7995301	But one of the performers at the event actually did a full on
7995781	7998143	PyramidHead routine.
7998143	8002285	It was fucking incredible because yes, it's a burlesque variety thing.
8002285	8007809	And we do have mostly women, but we also include non-binary and male performers as well.
8007809	8011991	So this was a male performer who did a whole PyramidHead inspired act.
8011991	8017715	And yes, that entire costume came off and I will let you theorize what was on underneath all of that.
8017715	8022318	And by the way, I'm just going to also shout out MistakenIdentity, the brand newest member
8022678	8028265	for this routine with Michael Myers to TikTok by Kesha.
8028265	8029367	It was so good.
8029367	8033111	My favorite part was she took off that whole thing.
8033111	8038038	She took off that outfit and there was another outfit underneath.
8038038	8039640	The same thing but bedazzled.
8041193	8041993	and OutfitReveal.
8062221	8066625	So I was telling jokes because I was saying, hey, I know you all could be a lot of places tonight.
8066625	8071890	I really appreciate that you spent your money here because I know you could have gone to see Taylor Swift, The Heiress Tour, right?
8071890	8073371	You know, because that movie is going on right now.
8073371	8080698	I said, have you seen all that crazy shit on TikTok with all like the girls dancing in front of the stage in the circle and doing all these weird things?
8080698	8083020	They're saying it's like the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
8083020	8086163	Like the Rocky Horror Picture Show is a cult movie.
8086163	8087705	Taylor Swift is just a cult.
8088265	8089746	Now, don't get me wrong.
8089746	8091327	I love Taylor Swift.
8091327	8097691	I can respect a businesswoman who brings to the table huge, I-can-buy-and-sell-this-company energy.
8097691	8103595	I respect the fact that Taylor Swift fucking hated the guy who owned her music so goddamn much.
8103595	8104796	She said, you know what?
8104796	8109699	I'm gonna re-record all of my albums so I no longer have to pay you.
8110672	8114333	So as a businesswoman, I fucking respect Taylor Swift.
8114333	8115253	I do.
8115253	8127557	That does not absolve her of this cult leader, Midsommar bullshit that I'm seeing in the theaters, which is a little bit, it's a little bit like Jesus camp to me.
8127557	8128537	I don't know what it is.
8129566	8143925	but I get big Jesus Camp vibes from it and I'm going to be staying away from the theater until I know those kids are in school and I can go watch that movie in the dark in peace by myself.
8143925	8144225	Alright.
8146655	8149857	E3VL in chat says, I watched the heiress tour in theaters.
8149857	8150677	It's pretty good.
8150677	8150958	Yeah.
8150958	8153999	And again, I actually, I actually, there's a lot of Taylor Swift songs.
8153999	8158222	I really like my favorite album by Taylor by Taylor.
8158222	8160363	Oh, she's different.
8160363	8164905	There's a lot of albums of Taylor Swift that are like hit and miss for me.
8164905	8169148	But like 1989 is like legit my favorite Taylor album.
8169148	8173810	And the fact that she's rerecording that one next, I'm actually very interested in that.
8173810	8174851	So it should be interesting.
8176432	8181116	I actually don't love the newer stuff quite as much.
8181116	8187062	And yes, I would agree, Kylie Minogue is superior.
8187062	8197652	But the energy to re-record around your former label owner is pretty, pretty good energy.
8197652	8197832	Yes.
8198912	8204335	Bobby Blackwell says, I'm afraid if I play it in Blackwell theater, the Swifties will find my house and come dance.
8204335	8208858	Here's the other important note to at the end of the day.
8208858	8216922	This exact same thing is going to happen with the Beyonce movie because of Beyonce is doing the exact same thing.
8216922	8222145	And it will be the exact same thing with a very different crowd.
8222145	8222285	And
8223907	8226688	Will I see the Beyonce movie as well?
8226688	8227649	Absolutely.
8227649	8229690	Do I feel similarly about Beyonce?
8229690	8230470	Believe it or not, yeah.
8230470	8233332	Like some of her songs, I love some of her songs.
8233332	8235953	I can kind of take it or leave it, to be honest, to be perfectly honest.
8235953	8241436	But unlike Taylor Swift, I actually really dig Beyonce's newer albums.
8241436	8249740	I thought this last one that was a whole tribute to a New York City voguing scene of the 90s and all that stuff, I thought that album was actually fantastic.
8249740	8252641	So I'm looking forward to that movie for sure.
8254331	8258634	Isn't this interesting that that's what now like movie theaters are, are these big tours?
8258634	8264018	Like, to be honest, this new Madonna tour, I hope it gets a movie too.
8264018	8264598	Have you heard of it?
8264598	8267700	There's 40 songs in the new Madonna tour.
8267700	8269161	40.
8269161	8274585	I'll just watch the one that she did in the 80s.
8274585	8276006	Oh, Truth or Dare?
8276006	8276306	That is.
8276306	8276926	Truth or Dare.
8276926	8277727	Yeah.
8277727	8278928	Although, what's her name?
8281323	8282524	Why can't I think of her name now?
8282524	8284704	Julie Brown, not downtown.
8284704	8285765	Yeah, as Medusa.
8285765	8286465	Yeah, Medusa.
8286465	8287665	And that was hilarious.
8287665	8288345	Yep.
8288345	8288605	Yep.
8288605	8290286	Kathy Griffin's in that movie.
8290286	8294267	It's a very, very, yeah, older movie.
8294267	8296707	But what was I going to say?
8296707	8305830	If Madonna were to release her concert in new theaters, that would also be yet another very different crowd showing up to that in all of their walkers and canes.
8307743	8311887	and I say that with all self-deprecation in mind.
8311887	8318773	Okay, with that, we're gonna wrap up the show tonight and move on out of here.
8318773	8324538	DarkSakura, I know you have a stream that you're gonna go do, some Dead by Daylight you were mentioning earlier.
8324538	8328081	Sounds like you have an old friend coming back to the stream tonight to play.
8328081	8328522	That'll be fun.
8328858	8329839	Yeah, I do.
8329839	8335802	Um, I'll have to just double check and see if he's still down for but other than that, it's going to be trying to get more adept.
8335802	8340764	So yeah, I make the mad dash to the bathroom and back in time.
8340764	8343886	So I will see everybody after TwitchCon.
8343886	8351010	And if you find me at TwitchCon, be prepared to be interrogated for my vlog.
8351010	8352511	All right, have fun.
8352511	8353471	Have a good stream.
8353471	8354612	And we'll see.
8354612	8355732	I'll see you next week.
8355732	8356993	But most of us will see you in two weeks.
8361002	8365205	I forgot the part where I say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8365205	8369249	We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices out there to put out on air.
8369249	8379398	So tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word and nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify, or wherever it is you found this show it goes an awful long way and we appreciate it.
8379398	8379939	So thank you.
8379939	8380920	Thank you.
8380920	8382301	Loki with that your final thought.
8383732	8389496	My final thought is I'm going to be working on hopefully getting another episode out this week.
8389496	8391317	Awesome.
8391317	8393018	And then my final thought is I'm really sorry.
8393018	8403725	I have fallen so far behind on my own streaming just between being actually sick two weeks ago, being side effects sick this last week, and just a lot going on in my day job.
8403725	8404865	It just kind of stacked everything up.
8404865	8406766	I haven't really had time to do VOG videos either.
8406766	8407427	So sorry.
8407427	8409788	I also was hosting two shows this week.
8409788	8410209	Excuse me.
8410209	8411930	I didn't just host the show tonight or last night.
8412730	8418533	I got to host a show at a museum on Thursday, a literal art museum, probably the biggest art museum in this area.
8418533	8419654	I got to host a show.
8419654	8420955	That was awesome.
8420955	8426017	So my emceeing is officially a recognized work of art now.
8427361	8428883	EgoInflate++.
8428883	8429463	All right.
8429463	8433447	Anyway, all kidding aside, I've been very grateful for every opportunity.
8433447	8433927	And that's it.
8433927	8434888	That's my final thought.
8434888	8436610	I'm grateful for every opportunity.
8436610	8440434	And I'm grateful for all of you that show up here and listen to the show every week.
8440434	8447601	Whether you're doing it live here on Sunday night, or you're listening on a podcast feed, however you are consuming Orange Lounge Radio, I appreciate you.
