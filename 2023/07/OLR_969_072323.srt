00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,600
In the latest misreading and misapplication of the European Union's GDPR, Ubisoft has

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,800
an inactivity period for Ubisoft Connect where you may lose your account irretrievably. It's

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,200
a good thing my entire Ubisoft library exists in Steam because we've learned that Ubisoft

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,480
can't be trusted to manage reasonable accounting. At least Google had the consideration to refund

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,280
software and hardware charges. This is the latest death now for Connect. Now it's time

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,520
for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,860
and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,860
a voice.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,760
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,000
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again, July the 23rd,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,680
2023 with episode number 968. Excuse me. No, that's wrong. The number's wrong. It's

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,360
episode 969 of our show. Wow. Whoever did that is totally fired. My name is Rob Roberts

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,680
and joining me as they do every single week here on the program, say hello to DarkSakura

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Hi.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Hi. How are you?

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,440
I'll be fine when my meds kick in.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,560
Yeah. Well, I've been there, done that, but I hope you do feel better.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,120
Yeah, I'll be fine. It's just been an incredibly busy week and you know what? Incredibly busy

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:37,400
weeks yield me sleeping until 1.30 in the afternoon on my first day off.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I tried.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
I still got up and did my ballet stuff.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,520
I tried to sleep in yesterday and it wasn't happening. I don't know if it was the cats

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:55,640
or my natural body clock or what, but I could not. I needed, as I call him with Alan, I'm

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,280
out of salad pills to help me sleep. So I needed a salad pill to help me sleep and I

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,960
didn't have one, unfortunately.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,520
I have my own things that I take for sleep that I'm actually thinking about finding something

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,320
better just because part of my condition is hypersomnia and I can have cataplexic moments

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,520
during the day. For anyone who doesn't know what cataplexy is, it's when your body just

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,760
kind of stops responding and loses its tension. You know, like people who randomly fall down

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,760
when they walk. You know, I'm not that severe, but it's been a lot worse and I have a suspicion

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,200
that part of the heat is to blame for that. But it's just a little bit like not good when

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,880
you're in the middle of working on something and suddenly your hand doesn't want to work

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,880
and then five seconds later, it's okay.

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,360
Well, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Hello.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,600
Hopefully you're doing a little better this week. Hope all is going well. I notice in

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,640
the background tonight as we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network,

39
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,360
twitch.tv slash vog network. That's VOG network. Nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,880
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. I noticed behind you, you have the, I think that's the

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,280
original fallout or fallout to playing fallout. Yeah. All out. That's pretty good. What, what,

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,740
what made you think of the OG fallout tonight?

43
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,380
It's the closest thing I could get to Oppenheimer. So I see, I see. Will you be, will you be

44
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,460
flipping over to Barbie halfway through the show?

45
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,300
We've already done Barbie, but yeah, we could. I mean, it would be fair.

46
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,980
It would be fair. Yes, it would.

47
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,420
It's too bad. I can't like do like half Barbie half.

48
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,020
You that's what you need to set up. You need to set up OBS or whatever you're using on

49
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,640
a split screen and you're going to fall out on one side and Barbie horse adventure is

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,040
on the other. And there you go. You got your barb and Heimer.

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,320
My, yeah, my brain just went to Barb and Heimer as like this new, uh, uh, gestalt creature

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:17,460
that you have to like fight as an enemy where everything is, you know, you've got the Oppenheimer

53
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:23,560
on one side and then you have the Barbie on the other. So they're like a combination.

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,800
I can't make brain happen. That's fine. It's you, you can appreciate this though. As somebody

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,120
pointed out on the book of faces to me this week is that, um, the Barb and Heimer thing,

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,480
um, that already happened in the nineties. We've already been there. They called it tank

57
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
girl.

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:47,760
Oh, tank girl. Tank girl proceeds. I mean, tank girl, the comics. Yeah, no, I don't.

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,520
I know. Yeah. Although I love, I, I personally thought the tank girl movie was fine and I

60
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,800
was already a fan of the comics. Apparently. I don't know if this is true or not, uh, somebody

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,000
who's in tune with the movie news, like tire car, somebody in our discord needs to correct

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,400
me or whatever. I heard that Margot Robbie, of course, Barbie, and you know, lots of other,

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,480
um, really legendary characters in movies right now, including what else she's been,

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,120
been Harley Quinn, she's been Tanya Harding, Harding. So, uh, Margot Robbie apparently

65
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,800
has the rights to tank girl or has some sort of like, I mean, I can see that he doesn't

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,520
work directly with Hewlett. I would be pissed. I'm, I'm sure it would be respectful. Margot

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,280
Robbie's been pretty, pretty good for Hollywood. Honestly, I really can't complain. And then

68
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,960
bring iced tea out of retirement to play the ripper again. Yeah. Um, I, I, I, shockingly,

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,320
I have not seen Barbie or Oppenheimer. I probably, I doubt I'll see Oppenheimer, but I want to

70
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,240
see Barbie really bad, but I was hosting a show last night here locally. One of the burlesque

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,400
troop was doing their thing last night. So I just didn't get to the theater this weekend.

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,960
Did you go, Logie? No, I, I, I thought my wife wanted to see Barbie, um, which I would have

73
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,200
been fine with. Um, no, we didn't end up going. I'll probably go next week though. See, um, Ninja

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,120
turtles, but Oh, there you go. I want to see Barbie rub. I do too. So the problem, if you

75
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,560
want to go like for serious, we need to go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night, because remember I'm,

76
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm flying to Atlanta on Thursday, so I'm out next weekend. Yeah. Well, Monday I don't have ballet

77
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,760
and I can always, I said I was going to stream at my normal time, but I can always switch stuff

78
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,160
around. I mean, um, for Barbie. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for Barbie. And this is a perfect tie

79
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,520
into some streams I've done recently. I don't know. Have you, have you seen the cast of final

80
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,200
fantasy 16 on Twitter? Are we quick? Cause it's like, um, originally the Clive's voice actor,

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:51,480
Ben Starr did one. And now the guy that did, um, uh, Sid did one where they're going like one

82
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:59,880
ticket to Barbie, please. They're doing it in the final fantasy 16. I don't know why I don't know

83
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,400
who put him up to it. I don't know. Heard though that there are, there's like one

84
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,880
message that seems to have been slipping over people's heads. And that's that without spoiling

85
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:21,080
anything. Cause I had to go look up some context for this is that it reiterates this, um, narrative

86
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:29,800
that there has to be one group in charge over another group. And, uh, apparently I haven't

87
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,120
seen that coming from anybody else, but from what I know about it, that has actually seemed fairly

88
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,720
apt, uh, observance. Um, and so I really, really want to get the context out of it by seeing the

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,000
whole thing. Well, that's, I'm also waiting for cinema therapy to do an episode on it.

90
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,440
I was going to say, uh, I had a few friends see it and basically they said that it,

91
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,000
it ruined them. Um, in the sense that like they were extremely emotional afterwards and like

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,040
ugly crying and that type of stuff. Um, which is interesting. So I was like, Oh, okay.

93
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,840
But going, you know, piggybacking on what you said, dark soccer though, is that it,

94
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,280
it kind of makes this Barbenheimer phenomenon more interesting because usually you would expect

95
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,880
a lot of, you know, Oh, the movies are going up against each other, which movie is going to be

96
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,240
number one, which one's going to flop at the bottom. But this one's very much like, like

97
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,880
literally the two movies are uplifting each other. And like this whole, it's this wild phenomenon

98
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,560
that's happening with this thing, even though we've had counter programming or whatever you

99
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,640
want to call it before it's and people are already looking ahead. Now they're talking about, uh,

100
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,200
Saw Patrol because, uh, Saw 10 and Paw Patrol come out the same day.

101
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,320
Mike makes a good point out that it's like with Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal.

102
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,400
Yes. Yes. That is, that is a great point. Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal,

103
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,400
somebody else. I will say this right now. I will not see any Saw movies,

104
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
but I will in solidarity play a few pig matches in Dead by Daylight.

105
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Perfect. Um, I was going to say there was also a great meme about, uh, the Dark Knight

106
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:13,000
and Mamma Mia also come, came out the same day. So, uh, the, what did they say? The Dark Mama

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,320
walked so Barb and Hymer could run. It's pretty good. I love it. I love it. It's great. Anyway,

108
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,000
at some point I'll get out and see the movies, but you know, just other stuff going on and

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,360
video games to play, but I do hope we can go see Barbie. The hot stuff also is very much a,

110
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,120
but I mean, I get going, the air, the theaters are always air conditioned and quite comfortable.

111
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,720
Usually. Usually. And practically have beds in them.

112
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,240
Yeah. Yeah. So it is nice. My problem these days is trying not to fall a fucking sleep

113
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,040
while I'm in a movie. Just put in massage chairs and I'll just die there. Okay.

114
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Yeah. And by the way, just to, uh, follow up, uh, somebody in chat about the Margot Robbie

115
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,520
tank girl thing had said, Questbuster said, Margot Robbie's company has the rights.

116
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,000
So here's hoping, hoping so interesting fingers crossed.

117
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,720
All right. I just don't think that a proper tank girl movie can be done without Jamie Hewlett's

118
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,960
involvement. Um, and I was glad that there was a lot of, at least the artwork, I don't know if it

119
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,520
was him that did the art or artwork just in his direct style in the Lori Petty movie. But I mean,

120
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,360
if you want to know what else he gave us gorillas. Well, and a Lori Petty cameo would be mandatory

121
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,720
in whatever they do. Like mandatory. I love Lori. Unless she says no, but why would she say no?

122
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,560
Yeah. Anyway, of course, nothing is happening if they don't resolve that SAG-AFTRA strike as

123
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,680
well as the writer's Guild strike. So, um, obviously here's hoping that, um, the studios

124
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,280
will fucking cave on this bullshit, especially regarding AI and all this and give the actors

125
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,760
the fair contract they're looking for. So, you know, solidarity with those that are protesting.

126
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,320
We'll get some exec thinking he can write or, you know, hiring someone on Fiverr.

127
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,440
Yeah. Which by the way, I, I want to, um, you know, it is a gaming show and I want to get

128
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,640
into video game news, but all this stuff is important. Well, number one, if you didn't

129
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,160
already know, video game stuff is not part of the SAG-AFTRA strike. So like, for example,

130
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,360
I've been talking about my trip to Atlanta Southern Fried Game Expo, and I'm going to be,

131
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,680
lucky enough to moderate a panel with Nintendo voice actors from some of the recent Nintendo

132
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,720
games who voice act Bowser, as well as Princess Peach, Princess Rosalina. Um, and it's not the,

133
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,960
don't confuse it with a movie. These are the games, you know, dating way back. Um,

134
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,440
and some people are like, can you even talk about that? Yes, we can. I do not know if these folks

135
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,920
are members of SAG-AFTRA or not. I am assuming they are because I think voice acting merged

136
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,400
into that some time ago. And that's also why SAG and the voice actors already negotiated a strike

137
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,840
a couple of years ago. You may recall that there was a video game strike that I want to say was

138
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,200
threatened. I think it did go through, but only for a couple of weeks. I don't think it lasted

139
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:11,000
very long. Um, so, uh, video games are not part of what is being struck right now. So with

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,680
conventions and stuff, they are allowed to promote and talk about games. They're just not allowed to

141
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,320
talk about any movies that they may be affiliated with. So, uh, there's that. Yeah. Bobby Blackwell

142
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,960
says SAG has a separate voice actor contract. There's many, many, many different, um, types of,

143
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,000
you know, contracts and so forth. And so, uh, but obviously, you know, we, we hope by the time

144
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,960
Dragon Con rolls around or, cause you know, San Diego Comic-Con has already had to deal with it

145
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,920
this weekend is that you can't ask actors about their projects. Um, which, you know, is

146
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,600
understandable. You want to support the strike, but at the same time, it's like, Oh, this is,

147
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,480
this is a difficult line to walk. So hopefully in the next few weeks, uh, the studios will cave in

148
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,760
and, um, you know, get this AI bullshit out of here along with the other it's, I know AI is the

149
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,200
only thing I'm kind of laser focused on, but there's many other elements of the contract too.

150
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,320
And there's, you know, all the information out there on the internet, if you want to look it up.

151
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:09,560
Um, so yeah, uh, be interesting to see what comes of all that. Um, okay. I really do want to get

152
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,280
into some gaming news though. I want to talk a little bit about the recent Diablo four patch.

153
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,080
And the reason why I want to bring this up at the top of the show is that this really goes beyond

154
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:28,680
just one game. Um, this is more about the reaction to this and everything that's going on as well as

155
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,520
the patch itself. Loki, I don't know if you want me to talk about this or you want, you want to

156
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,120
do this? Cause I'm not familiar with it. Okay. That's fine. I'll talk about it. Other than

157
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,080
patch, bad walk back patch. Yeah. Uh, I know Diablo four is a little more of my camp and

158
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,720
that's fine. So I'll talk about this. So here's what's happened is that there was a patch that

159
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,120
went out this week in preparation for season one. Keep in mind that seasons are not new to Diablo.

160
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,840
They exist in Diablo three and Diablo two remastered. Um, it's all about kind of restarting

161
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,920
the character from scratch that everybody's on the same playing field. And usually there's unique

162
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,880
rewards to the season. It's kind of, kind of a reason to start playing again. It's kind of

163
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,200
a different way of doing like prestiging, if you will. Um, controversial with Diablo four is the

164
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,600
fact that they're doing a battle pass, uh, with the seasons, but the battle pass is a hundred

165
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,080
percent cosmetic. There's nothing in the battle pass that is, you know, actually affecting game

166
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,800
mechanics. Well, I take that back, but there is something in it, but the rewards are on the free

167
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,160
tier that affect, um, the season specific mechanics, but those rewards are on the free

168
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,120
tier. So the paying for it will not change that. Um, but, uh, either way, whether you wanted to pay

169
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,880
for the battle pass or not actually, and if you got a limited edition version of the game, you

170
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,000
already have the battle pass, which you can redeem in any season technically, but I don't know why

171
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,280
you wouldn't redeem it in season one. I don't see what's going to be better or different about

172
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,560
season two, but it is your choice. At the end of the day, you do, you do you. Um, but the pre-patch

173
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,920
before season one, so season one started Thursday and a pre-patch went live earlier this week.

174
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,240
And people did not respond positively to this patch because some of the things that they were

175
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,280
doing in this patch were a lot of character nerfs. They were doing a lot of, you know,

176
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,800
different powers on, uh, different characters who were being nerfed and rolled back. And one

177
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,480
of the biggest things that they were nerfing was experience. They actually were rolling back some

178
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,880
different types of experience. Um, I want to actually see if I can get the patch notes

179
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,200
actually up here. Unfortunately, this article I thought would have them didn't, but let me see

180
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:45,720
if I can grab them real quick here. Um, sorry. I'm, uh, should have had that up beforehand.

181
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Uh, but in the pack, cause I want to cite some specifics here if I can. Okay. Yes, this is it.

182
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,080
So I'm going to go over to, for those of you watching live on Twitch, we're going to hop over

183
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,640
to the other screen so you can see these with me here. Okay. So they set up some things for the

184
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,680
actual, you know, season that this whole mechanic that's unique to the season. Okay. And then they

185
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,240
talk about, all right, they're doing, you know, some things with the items and so forth and,

186
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,280
you know, bug fixes, the usual types of things you would expect. But then when you really start

187
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,440
to get down into it, you start to get some interesting updates. Um, for example, there's

188
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,160
some renown value upgrades. This is good because it actually up the amount of renown you get from

189
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,000
doing side quests, which is, um, helps you get rewards that are locked behind that. Okay. But

190
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,240
this was one of the big things level scaling in dungeons was adjusted. Um,

191
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,400
monsters start to trail behind the player and level at a certain point. And this change does not

192
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,880
affect this, but what happens is that let's say, uh, at world tier three, if you are below 55,

193
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,320
the levels 55, that, uh, the experience, this is what I wanted to get to pre season. If the

194
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,920
mobs were one level higher, you get 15% extra three levels higher, 25% extra. They change this

195
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:11,160
now you only get a 1.5% bonus. So the amount of extra experience you get for the mobsters being

196
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,040
higher level than you is kind of not worth it. And one reason they were trying to do this is

197
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,800
they were trying to actually make it so that if you are playing with your friend, so if you're

198
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,880
level one and your friends want to bring you right to the end game to power level you, that trick is

199
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,400
not going to work anymore. So now you're only going to get, so before you would get level 100

200
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,200
monster XP, which is a lot and a 25% bonus on top of that. Now you get an 11 monster XP and

201
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,400
a small bonus on top of that. Now, Mike Defton chat says, this one is fair. I agree. They're

202
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,280
trying to avoid a situation here. Like what happens in Diablo three seasons. And what happens

203
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,520
in Diablo three seasons right now is that people just the first person that gets to level 70 power

204
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,800
levels, all of their friends. And it kind of takes away the leveling experience. A fundamental thing

205
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,440
you have to understand that is a difference between Diablo three and four is that the word

206
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,000
Paragon means something very different. In Diablo three Paragon levels were basically like boundary

207
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,800
breaking levels. You were at the max level and Paragon levels go on and on and on for infinity

208
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,040
and boundary break. People want to rush into that stage of the game. In Diablo four, that is not the

209
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:35,480
case. Levels 50 to 100 are Paragon levels, but they're just extra levels. They're not exactly a

210
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,960
boundary break. Most people see level 100 as the boundary. Blizzard does not really play this any

211
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,560
differently, because they keep talking about the race to level 100, the first hardcore character

212
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,200
to 100 and all of this stuff. So you have to remember that Diablo three and four are set up

213
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,840
differently. And that's why I don't find this such a big deal because Blizzard is basically trying

214
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,080
to say you're not going to cheat your way to level 100. You need to play your way through the game.

215
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,000
But what's a little weird to me is that the way they did this, like a normal way I would level

216
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,240
playing solo would be to do nightmare sigil dungeons three levels above where I was at,

217
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,640
because that's about you know what you can do solo and you would get a 25% bonus. But for some reason

218
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,240
you can't do that anymore. I'm not sure why they changed that because I mean that doesn't really

219
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,000
affect the power level game. But all right, I mean, I'm gonna respect their decisions and so

220
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,560
forth. And I'll just say, okay, well, then you just do, you know, nightmare sigils that are around

221
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,840
your own level and so forth, whatever. It's just an interesting way to play the game. And then they

222
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,560
talked all about these other balance updates. And there's a lot if you want to look at everything

223
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,560
they changed with, you know, barbarian and so you can go into the patch notes look, but overall,

224
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,720
people were not pleased with all these nerves. But I also understand why they made some nerves

225
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,560
because you got to go all the way back. This season mechanic that they're putting in

226
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,640
the season of the malignant, malignant hearts are being added to the game, these are going to give

227
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,000
you extra power, they needed to do some nerves to accommodate for the extra powers that are going

228
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,080
to be coming with malignant hearts, so that you can't just raffle stomp your way through the game.

229
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,800
And again, people burning their way all over the level 100 right off the top. So I'm not going to

230
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,720
say that like there are some things in the patch that didn't quite make sense. But I don't think

231
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,200
this was really the OMG, the world is ending thing that some of the Diablo community made it out to

232
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,600
be. Disclaimer, I'm also not a level 100 player. So I can imagine that there are a lot of people

233
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,200
that were in end game theory crafting the numbers playing end game, not happy to see these nerves,

234
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,440
because it's going to feel like a setback before they really have a chance to experience the

235
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:59,240
malignant hearts and all of this stuff. So I thank you, Dr. C says I'm by no means a Diablo expert.

236
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,960
So I definitely appreciate my the perspective from folks that know better. I am by no means

237
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,440
Diablo expert either, but I'm a fan. And I'm trying to take a step back and go okay,

238
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,680
as in most cases, is this as bad as the internet is making it out to be on social media?

239
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,120
And the answer as far as I'm concerned is not quite. There are some question marks and there

240
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,760
are some weird things. But I don't think this was the worth the meltdown that people were having

241
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,440
over this. But nevertheless, when I say meltdown, I mean review bombing. So of course, here we go

242
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,080
with the Metacritic review bombs again, as if Metacritic user reviews should mean a goddamn

243
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,480
thing at this point, because this is what always happens to Metacritic user reviews. Don't read

244
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:48,120
them, don't trust them. They're, they're nothing. So Blizzard then also actually did a little round

245
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,200
table with associate game director Joe Paporia, game director Joe Shealy and community chief Adam

246
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,440
Fletcher, they did, they threw this together, really, they did a live event on Friday,

247
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,560
to try to address what happened. And they actually said in a quote here, Adam Fletcher said,

248
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,360
it's not the greatest play experience for players out there. We don't plan on doing a patch like

249
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,120
this ever again. We hear you loud and clear. Joe Paporia followed up, we know that reducing player

250
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,320
power is never a good experience. Sometimes we just don't get it quite right. So they went on

251
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,960
to detail some of the things that they're going to change. And part of that is the XP adjustment.

252
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,320
So the road from 50 to 100 is not going to be quite as rough as it was before. There's going

253
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,440
to be you know, there were some things that they're going to fix with hot fixes that were

254
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,000
unintended, like world tier level changes, they weren't supposed to change. And so they were able

255
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,040
to hot fix some of that and all this stuff. As you want to Matt and chat says seems like part

256
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,080
of their strategy is trying to slow the burn a little bit. Some of those balances did make sense.

257
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,920
Yes, there is a part of this where they're trying to slow the burn. Absolutely. And so again, I'm

258
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,920
not saying that like, the player base that got angry had no reason to be upset. I think it was

259
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:07,240
just maybe a little blown out of control. Anyway, in chat from quest Buster says I was not happy at

260
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,000
all after making it to 100 and then stacking hours on top of that to farm gear to perfect said build

261
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,800
and then have this patch disrespect the time I spent was not a great feeling. I was upset,

262
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,160
but then I just walked away from the game and I'm taking a break, which honestly,

263
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:27,160
is probably the best thing to do in this scenario. Like when it's affecting your mood like that.

264
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,040
I think that's very smart to recognize I should take a step back away from the game and do all

265
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:38,360
this thing. And I can see where it gets frustrating needing getting to 100 and having all this change.

266
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,760
But I'm kind of curious if you see yourself coming back to play the season at some point

267
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,160
to see what the game looks like at level 100. With this new season mechanic thing in there.

268
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,560
I'm kind of I just I'm kind of would be curious about this. So anyway, that's in a nutshell all

269
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,880
that's going on this week with Diablo four is just again, I see this as bigger than just Diablo

270
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:14,760
because again, you have the user base the fans making so much noise about this that they they

271
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,240
caused the community to really jump and do a unplanned roundtable about the patch after the

272
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,360
fact. And then you know, basically admit to we need to communicate better in the future, which

273
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,440
I would say that's better than most gaming companies are doing Niantic right now when it

274
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:40,680
comes to some of this feedback. So Zen monkey 11 and chat says all this season stuff games do now

275
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:48,280
is just annoying and stupid to me. Well, thank fortnight. Because now you have a lot of games

276
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,880
that are doing this. And to be fair with the season stuff again, season play existed in Diablo

277
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,160
three, but it didn't exist at the beginning. They did add it later on. There was no battle pass,

278
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,320
though. So that's also another thing that felt very different about Diablo three. To my follow

279
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,440
up question, he doesn't cost 60 $70 either. That's true, too. And that's a fair point.

280
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,720
questbuster and chat says I'm on the fence. I've been toying with playing a necro, which I should

281
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,760
have done from the start, which got off relatively unscathed. Plus, I like minion classes. You know,

282
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,240
what's funny is I am playing a necromancer in the season, but I'm doing the bone spear build where

283
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,320
you you don't have any you sacrifice all your minions for bonuses. So kind of kind of a

284
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,120
different way to do things. So anyway, I thought that was kind of interesting. And, you know,

285
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,240
we'll see how this develops and the Blizzard communicating with their player base. Again,

286
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,480
I know some people are still angry about stuff, but I still feel like they're doing more here

287
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,400
than most game companies are doing right now. And you know, again, a lot of that is probably things

288
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,560
they've had to learn from the past and some of the missteps with Wow, Overwatch, etc. Pretty much all

289
00:25:53,560 --> 00:26:00,360
the Blizzard games have had a problem patch at some point for sure. So Zen monkey says I just

290
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,800
like four seasons once they go past four and get into season 25. I'm like WTF This is dumb lol.

291
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,920
Diablo threes on season 28 right now. So speaking of which, so I don't know what season Fortnite's

292
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,480
in. Fortnite hides it though, because don't they reboot don't they reboot the world and then they

293
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,720
call it like chapter four or something? Well, they have they have seasons in like, chapters,

294
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,640
I think or something like that. So there's different like events that go on throughout

295
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,880
the year, but then they like do like a like a massive reset and stuff. But it's usually

296
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,640
progressive, like a storyline and they have a big finale and then it's like the brand new season.

297
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,800
And Dark Soccer and I talk a lot about Dead by Daylight. And essentially, the tomes are season

298
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,920
events in that game, you know, so it's it's what's present in a lot of games these days and a lot of

299
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:55,560
genres. So but you don't, you also don't really have to buy anything to redeem them, you can use

300
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,760
iridescent shards that you run by playing the game. So it doesn't necessarily require real

301
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,560
money. Yeah. Not that I'm not gonna spend real money to do it. And the iridescent shards can

302
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,080
take a while depends how much you play. I mean, if you play a lot, then yeah, you probably will

303
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,560
get enough. So well, I don't know I use mine for blood points like all the time. Ah, here.

304
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,640
All right. Well, speaking of our gaming weeks, whether it be Diablo, DVD or otherwise, let's

305
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,440
talk about our gaming weeks in our kickoff segment. How was your gaming week? Dark Sakura,

306
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:36,520
how was your game? Mine was actually fairly eventful. So I did switch to going back to

307
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:44,840
retro games on my Saturday stream. And so I am playing live live. And I'm playing the original

308
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:52,120
and playing the Super Famicom version. I have a translation of it. And I am absolutely loving it.

309
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:59,560
I made it through the caveman scenario and pretty much laughed the whole time. I also played

310
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,920
Oh, gosh, what was the Kirby game on Super Nintendo? The one that was multiple Kirby

311
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,680
games. I always forget the name of it because there's so many different Kirby games. But I

312
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:20,760
played the Japanese one of it. Superstar. Yeah, I played Hoshino Kabi played through a little bit

313
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,600
of it got through the wispy woods fight. You know, it was pretty fun. Basically, I was just

314
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:31,320
I was testing out my new controller. I played Strider two for PlayStation. Super deluxe. Thank

315
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:40,120
you, Mike. If anyone knows this mic. But I played through a couple of stages of Strider two. I played

316
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:49,800
through Jackie crush for also for Super Famicom. I played super fantasy zone, which was the version

317
00:28:49,800 --> 00:29:01,160
of fantasy zone that came out on the Sega Mega Drive aka Genesis. Just about a few other things,

318
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,560
I was trying to just make sure the ones that said were translated were actually translated.

319
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:15,320
And some were some were not played a little radiant silver gun. You know, I tried to get

320
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,360
bots a gun working and I couldn't get it to work. So I'm back to the drawing board on that.

321
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:37,960
But, um, I also of course, played a significant amount of dead by daylight. And I words we had

322
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:45,560
some pretty fun things happen. Um, we, I had a peekaboo with with a Bubba.

323
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,720
It was actually really cute. And I did make a clip of that one just because it was so cute.

324
00:29:52,440 --> 00:30:00,120
Um, like Bubba surprised me most of the time you expect to be face camping, basement camping,

325
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:07,480
trolling, you know, tunneling shitheads. And then you find the one Bubba who's just like,

326
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:16,360
I'm gonna fun Bubba fun. Yeah, fun Uncle Bubba. Oh, nevermind that I'm wearing somebody else's

327
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:25,080
face. It's no one you know. Isn't it cages Tuesday? Yes, I think that's fun. I'm definitely

328
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,320
gonna be every every match is gonna be for Nick cages for a bit. Well, three Nick cages and the

329
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:39,160
person who didn't want to buy the DLC. Well, um, I am not going to be playing him right off the

330
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,520
bat, I think unless I'm just going to go ahead and get the adapt out of the way. But his perks

331
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:52,600
are pretty Mimi. Um, like, I don't even know I think I'm gonna have fun. But I'm also looking

332
00:30:52,600 --> 00:31:00,680
forward to his red carpet cosmetic that's coming out the studded jacket. And the 50 bajillion

333
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,880
voice lines. I watched a video that was all of his voice lines. I guess I should say I listened

334
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:17,320
to the video. There's a lot of shits and fucks out there. Lots of them. And not at the same time,

335
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:24,040
by the way, but usually in the same sentence. Um, I played with some word scapes, you know,

336
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,960
my usual little, you know, what I play when I'm not doing anything else game.

337
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,080
Excuse me, that's, that's that. Um, my, my schedule for the week is changing a little

338
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,440
bit because I don't have ballet on Monday. So I'm going to be able to go a little bit

339
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,560
later continuously on Monday, and then I'm doing a marathon on Sunday when we should be doing a while

340
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:57,640
are good times 1130 to 1130. I'm gonna just pass out when I'm done, I think.

341
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,720
All right. Oh, and apart from gaming, my eye infection is healing. Finally,

342
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,000
it's hard to play games when your eye is like constantly watering. It's kind of gross.

343
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,600
Uh, Loki, how was your game week?

344
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:24,120
Um, it was all Minecraft again. So I went ahead and was working more on my final three episodes.

345
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:31,320
There was a lot of like other work to like do infrastructure stuff for later on the season.

346
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,800
So I had to do a lot of that this week. But I'm hoping to get I was hoping to get it done today,

347
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:45,960
but it's probably going to be early next week. And then we also checked out MCC Island,

348
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,640
because there's this whole thing for so let's back up a bit. So MCC is minecrafter

349
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:00,120
or Minecraft creator clash. It's a event that they do every I don't know how often it is

350
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:08,680
pretty often at least once a month with like really popular Minecraft creators, like the

351
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,440
biggest creators out there. And then last year, I think it was last year, maybe two years ago,

352
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,360
they did this MCC rising where they they're like, Okay, plebes out there, we're gonna,

353
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,080
we're gonna let you play with the big boys a little bit. So you just submit your application.

354
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,000
And maybe if you're lucky, you'll, we'll let you in and you'll do your own event. So that's what's

355
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,400
happening. So we created one of our new members for season three on channel 64

356
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,520
was enticing us to, you know, get involved. So he put together a application video. So we did that

357
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,520
we have a team of four now. And we went and checked out MCC Island and I suck at everything

358
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,760
on there. It is not my style of gameplay. So like parkour PvP stuff, like it's just,

359
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,920
I always have to play more of it, I guess. But yeah, basically, you had they're gonna

360
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,280
pick 10 different teams out of these application videos. Last time, I think there was like 3200

361
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,440
videos submitted to them. So obviously a lot but assuming you get in everything, you know,

362
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,280
you may eventually get involved with the regular MCC as well, if you place pretty high in the MCC

363
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,000
Rising stuff. So it's a good way to, I guess, get your foot in the door, some of these people,

364
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,200
you know, end up on like empires and stuff like that. Some of these big things because you have,

365
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,000
you know, hermitcraft, the empires folks, dream, I mean, they're all like involved with MCC. So

366
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,360
it's all the biggest, the biggest creators in that space. But I suck at all of it. So it'll be great.

367
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:50,040
I had such a horrible time in MCC Island, but apparently it's harder than the actual game too.

368
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,240
But it's just different. I'm just not used to playing that kind of stuff. But it's also

369
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,720
a super long shot. Anyways, we had fun making the videos. So that was fine. I don't really hear

370
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,480
either way promoting it. So I was a little more curious what that was all about. So yeah, thanks

371
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,280
for elaborating. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, it's usually pretty fun. I mean, I don't know, like, they,

372
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,400
assuming you get in what they do, they have a coach that they'll give you. So they'll be one

373
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,720
of the MCC players will actually coach you through the games and stuff like that and get you ready.

374
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,560
The actual event takes place at the end of next month. So it'll be a very short turnaround. I

375
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,760
don't know how they go through 3000 some videos. I suspect that a lot of it's not the video and

376
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,720
some amount of subs you got because looking at the people from last year, it's like, Oh,

377
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,600
these small creators with only 1 million subscribers are going to participate. It's like,

378
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,520
come on. Like that's a little Do they really need help? I don't know. But we'll see. We'll see what

379
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,760
happens. I gotcha. All right. Well, good luck. My gaming week. I already kind of talked about

380
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,280
Diablo four. I am playing the season in Diablo four and I'm playing necromancer and up to level

381
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:06,520
38. I think just I just cleared the season quest today because there's a whole little quest that

382
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,720
goes to the season. Some of it's level gated because you have to clear some strongholds.

383
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,760
You can't really do until level 35. So it was gated a little bit, but I just got through that

384
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,920
whole quest. So that was, uh, it was neat that, you know, they didn't have that Diablo three

385
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,040
where you would have unique storylines in the season. So I thought that was good. I mean,

386
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,960
it wasn't in depth, but it had voice acting and a movie at the beginning. So I was like, okay,

387
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,040
that's kind of neat that they went all out with that. So, uh, that was cool. Um, I'll probably

388
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,840
keep playing the season for sure. I don't know if I'll get all the way up to level 100, but I,

389
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,240
I'm through a good chunk of the battle class pass. Granted, I use, you know, cause I had

390
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,240
limited edition. I got my free accelerated battle pass, which gave me 20 levels,

391
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,000
but I'm up to like tier 39 or 40. So, um, you know, kind of gone a long way through.

392
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,080
So I'll probably keep going. They have the season journey, which they had in Diablo three,

393
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,800
which were kind of like steps and they help get you like big chunks of battle pass, uh, stuff.

394
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,680
So I'll, I'll probably work on that a little bit. So that'll be something that I do in the coming

395
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,400
weeks. And, um, other games I've played, uh, I also played, um, Overwatch randomly,

396
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,360
a friend of mine, um, when it wanted to play games together. And it was one of those things

397
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,960
where we realized this is a game that we have in common. So I played a little bit of Overwatch.

398
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,680
We had some really good matches, uh, last week, but, uh, today we played some more and had some

399
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,320
not so great matches, but that's okay. Cause I feel like I'm not as big of a flop as I thought

400
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,800
in Overwatch. Um, especially when it comes to support classes, like I find that like playing

401
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,560
Lucio and mercy kind of like the, you know, the ones that have been there. My friend is kind of

402
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,920
forcing me to learn Ana, which I'm not very good with the snipers, but I'm kind of forcing myself

403
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,440
to learn Ana cause her toolkit is really useful. So, um, that's been interesting. I never thought

404
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,560
I'd get back into Overwatch, but, and I'm really only doing it for my friend, but, um, it's, um,

405
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:01,000
it doesn't suck. So there's that. Um, and then the other game, I feel the need to talk about

406
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,240
this week is something that got released that a lot of people are talking about this week.

407
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,320
Cause it's kind of game adjacent, but it's not really a game. It's an app. It's a little thing

408
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,320
called Pokemon sleep, uh, came out and, uh, you know, we've been kind of, this has been on our

409
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,640
radar a little bit because, you know, we like Pokemon and there's been a lot of like WTF,

410
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,240
why are they doing like a sleep thing? Like why, why, why is Pokemon sleep like a thing? Um,

411
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,480
and so Pokemon sleep finally came out this week and, um, I'm gonna review it here on the show by

412
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:37,160
saying, um, I don't fucking get it. And, uh, I've, I did it twice and I don't plan to do it ever

413
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,560
again. Um, I, I don't understand the point. I failed. Maybe I'm just old. Um, but this,

414
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:50,040
this is really, I, this is pointless. It's absolutely pointless. If you want to track,

415
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,080
not true. If you want to track your sleep, there are plenty of ways to do it

416
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:03,080
through Android or iOS. And if you have a smart watch, whether that be an Apple watch or, you

417
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,840
know, whatever watch it is you have, I guarantee there are sleep trackers that do it better than

418
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,080
what Pokemon sleep is doing with your phone, sitting on the corner of your bed and this whole

419
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,200
thing. But, but they, they're, they're able to, it's very important data that they're collecting.

420
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,760
They're collecting the sound of your loud farts. That's right. Apparently also get picked up by it.

421
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,880
That's right. It records you while you're asleep. Now you could turn that off. Cause

422
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,440
that is very creepy. And it's actually, it's very easy to turn that off. So in all fairness,

423
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,520
like the recording thing, cause a lot of people look at that and go, what the fuck? But you can,

424
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,680
you can turn that off like real easy. Like the game kind of goes out of its way really to have

425
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,200
you, this is how we're going to make the next Wario game that much better. They're forcing the

426
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:51,000
fart noises. I guess. And Mike Deaf says, Pokemon sleep is not there to replace whatever you use

427
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,600
already for sleep tracking. It's there to incentivize people who want to improve their

428
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,760
sleep. That's, that's what the existing sleep trackers are supposed to do. I'm sorry. I just,

429
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm going to tell you why there's again, like a lot of Pokemon games that come out, I feel it's

430
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,160
very messy. There's a lot of stuff like all over the place. Like, okay, you got to cook things for

431
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,360
Snorlax. And when you have the Pokemon, you'll get these random Pokemon that show up while you're

432
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,680
asleep and you can choose one of them to give a biscuit. Cause you're trying to make them your

433
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,720
friends so you can add them to the party and then they collect things in your party. And they, you

434
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,800
also have photographs that go on and then you want to check in three times a day, not just when you

435
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:37,080
sleep. Cause you want to cook the curries for Snorlax to gain the power. Everything I just

436
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,560
named is an actual thing in the game. And it doesn't make any goddamn sense. It doesn't.

437
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,400
And it's just, it's just one of those things where it's like, I w well plus also, okay,

438
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,000
so you get all these Pokemon. Why it doesn't connect to the other, is it going to connect

439
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,680
to Pokemon home at some point? If it does, then I, then I will shut up because then that makes a lot

440
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,800
more sense because it actually ties into the rest of the Pokemon universe. But otherwise it doesn't

441
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,680
like, like I've heard like, Oh, you can get shinies through this. I'd be fucking pissed

442
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,360
if I got a shiny in this game and I couldn't transfer it over to Pokemon home to actually

443
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:19,080
use in a real Pokemon game. So I don't know. Mike Deft says, it's really simple for me.

444
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,280
It's not that convoluted. I'm sorry, Deft. You know, I love you. I'm bringing the receipts.

445
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm bringing the receipts because I just, I I'm bringing it. I still have it on my phone,

446
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,600
although I plan to delete. Is it going to yell at me for not tracking the last couple of nights?

447
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:41,480
Probably. But okay. So yeah, I got, I got power for doing something and now Snorlax is like,

448
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,400
yay, I'm gonna, okay. I guess I went up a level. I did something, whatever. I got rewards. I have

449
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,360
no idea what these do. Here's, it's another rating. I have no idea what this does. Okay.

450
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,680
So there's that. And then there's another rating for your Snorlax there. So there's all the Snorlax

451
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,360
and then there's all these other Pokemon. So like I somehow have a Pichu and a Pikachu in my party.

452
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,360
And now look, you have all these buttons that do shit down here in the corner, the main menu. And

453
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,320
when you go to the main menu, look at this. God damn it. Now I'm getting more tips. Okay. You go

454
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,560
to the main menu and look at this. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

455
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,760
10, 11 buttons that all do different things. I heard you. Nevermind. I misheard what you

456
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,680
just said. What did you think I said? I thought you said you got tits.

457
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:40,200
Well, maybe I did. No, I did not. But anyway, my point is, is it a sleep tracker or is it a

458
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:47,160
micromanagement game? Because I'll tell you, it's a micromanagement game. And there, and again,

459
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,520
I want my micromanagement game to have somewhat of a point. There is, I guess, a friends feature,

460
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,520
but I connected it to Facebook. Nobody added me as a friend. And then when I went back in to see if

461
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,880
any of my friends were on it, it said, you need to reconnect to Facebook. So I was just like,

462
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm, I'm over this. I'm over this already. I don't get the point. I have a sleep tracker.

463
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,320
I've been running it for quite some time. If you want to see how horribly I sleep,

464
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:16,680
it's this lovely little thing that I have that shows me. So last night I got some pretty decent

465
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,040
sleep, but actually shows me like how it went and all that good stuff. So that's what I use.

466
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,680
Here's the thing. Maybe I would feel a little differently.

467
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,840
If the game would just tap into the existing data that my watch is already giving it.

468
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,640
Why does it need to do its own separate thing by lying on the bed and inferior way of tracking

469
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:45,000
sleep as opposed to something that can measure your heart rate regularly? I don't understand

470
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,880
that. And I do realize there is a separate device that you can also buy and all this,

471
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm still not going to track your heart rate. So it's just, it's wild. So I'm not a fan.

472
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,760
If you're a fan, congratulations. I hope you catch all the Pokemon and then won't be able

473
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,520
to do anything with them. But you'll feel really good. And that's the point. That's the point.

474
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,120
Yeah. We didn't even touch on monetization. There is monetization.

475
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,480
Oh, of course.

476
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,160
I, I can't tell you what it is because the minute I saw it, I was like, I'm, I will,

477
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:24,760
I will never give this game money. So I didn't even look into what it did anyway.

478
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:32,600
So that's, that's, that's my thought. So, okay. My dev says the dev say they would like to connect

479
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,960
with other existing apps or devices for sleep tracking. Great. I will be happy to amend my

480
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:45,560
review at that point, as it stands now, hard pass. In fact, it's coming off my phone. So that's that,

481
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,560
that little bit of me playing it right there is the last you're going to get for a little bit.

482
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,400
I love what SSU100Matt said in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

483
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,600
S2 100 Matt says bigger menu than the cheesecake factory. Yes.

484
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,480
But no complimentary bread. What's up with that?

485
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,000
All right. That was my gaming week. Let's get into some gaming news and what's going on around

486
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
the industry. We will start off with, Oh, and real quickly, just I've plugged it a lot, but I'm

487
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,320
legally required to say I will be at Southern fried gaming expo this weekend in Atlanta.

488
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,240
It is running the 28th through the 30th of July at the Marriott Renaissance Waverly hotel.

489
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,200
That is right by the Atlanta brave stadium, if you weren't already aware. So if you are somewhere in

490
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,600
the Atlanta area or even a little far, I encourage you to drive in, say hello. I'll be doing a panel

491
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,400
Sunday at one o'clock featuring Nintendo voice actors. I'm really excited to be there,

492
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,480
play a hell of a lot of video games and just have a good time. It's just going to be a fun weekend.

493
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,200
And then I'm looking forward to going right back in five more weeks for dragon con. I'm racking up

494
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,400
those frequent flyer miles, except I'm taking two different airlines for some reason. Well,

495
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:03,400
I know the reason why this trip I used reward points. The other trip, Alan and I are going,

496
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:12,280
so we bought Southwest. So yeah, anyway. All right, let's move on into some other

497
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,560
gaming news and what all is going on. So Loki, we'll start with you.

498
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,520
Yeah, so the end of the show last week, we talked a little bit about how game pass cores and be

499
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:31,000
replacing Xbox Live Gold. And we got some more details on that shortly after our show ended.

500
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:36,200
So basically, the four different tiers that they have now, they're all going to be game pass. So

501
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,640
game pass cores, basically what Xbox Live Gold was the main difference being that you're not going to

502
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,360
be getting the two games a month that they had previously. But instead, it's going to be kind of

503
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:57,720
a catalog of 25 high quality games, they say on console. So it's kind of like a smaller

504
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:05,240
library that you would have with the normal game pass. And that's $10 a month, they have the console

505
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,600
game pass, which is $11 a month. And then of course, you kind of know what that is PC, of

506
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:17,160
course, the PC game pass for 10 bucks, and then ultimate for 17 a month. And what games are going

507
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,600
to be coming with that collection? Well, they we do know what those are. And they said new titles,

508
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:28,360
and they said new titles we added two or three times a year. So some of the things in there

509
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:36,600
Among Us Dishonored 2, Doom Eternal, Fable Anniversary, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Forza Horizon

510
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:45,880
4, that's awesome. Gears 5, Grounded, Halo 5 Guardians, Halo Wars, Psychonauts 2, Ori and the

511
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,400
Will of the Wisps, State of Decay and The Elder Scrolls Online, Tamriel Unlimited. And then of

512
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,080
course, there's some other stuff in there as well. Among Us, for example. So not a bad library.

513
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,520
But yeah, so obviously, I think they're trying to entice people to just spend the extra dollar

514
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:11,320
and just get game pass. But if you don't want to, you don't have to and if you are an existing

515
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,080
Xbox Live Gold member, your membership will convert to game pass core on September 14.

516
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,040
Um, so some real talk for a minute, the free games they've been given away on Xbox Live Gold have not

517
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:30,520
exactly been scraping that bottom of the barrel for a while, some decent indie titles in there.

518
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,360
But let's be real, there is no showstoppers. Let's usually use that word. There's no showstopper

519
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:41,160
like get like attention grabbing giveaway they've done on Xbox Live Gold in a long time.

520
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,400
This allows the system to pivot to something where they can have some big names. A lot of

521
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,720
those names you just read right there can have some big names that are available. And of course,

522
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,760
are they available on cloud too? When you do this? I think that's a huge question. No,

523
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:04,280
because core is not cloud ultimate is the only one that has cloud play. So yeah, if you want,

524
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,600
I mean, I think the argument is that you would want to probably just have the regular game pass

525
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:16,840
if you're playing on console. It's only $1 more a month. Yeah, I mean, really for, you know,

526
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:23,000
25 versus hundreds of games and all the brand new like Microsoft games coming in there as well. Like

527
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,760
it just, it makes sense to do that. But I mean, if you're really looking not to spend that extra

528
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,240
dollar a month, I mean, it's already $10 a month. You just want quite a bit. You just want Madden

529
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,440
multiplayer. That's all you want life. You don't want anything else, then you there you go. You can

530
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:46,760
save the extra buck. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, the sj 100 match in chat says Yeah, I haven't touched

531
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,640
the games with gold games since pre game pass. I keep forgetting to download those people echo and

532
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,040
say same, same, same. The sometimes the only reason I remember the PlayStation ones with the

533
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,480
PlayStation ones have actually been kind of better like Alan Wake remastered I was actually really

534
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:05,080
excited about that. So like, but but PlayStation if you have the app will send you a push notification

535
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:12,360
and remind you, hey, it's not too late to grab Microsoft does not do that. Yeah. So it is kind

536
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:21,400
of nice. So but yeah, I this doesn't really surprise me. I'm surprised that the term Xbox

537
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,680
Live is going away. That is a little bit, you know, weird and like, Oh, wow, that was such,

538
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,680
you know, especially when that rolled out. If you think about it, this show has I mean, I don't like

539
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,280
to toot our own horn too much. But to to folks for a minute. This show has now seen the birth

540
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,680
and the death of Xbox Live. And that is wild to me. We were here when Xbox Live started,

541
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,760
it wasn't that long into the show was like six months after we started our and now here we are

542
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:56,520
at the end, which is wild to me. So but I mean, everything that game pass is doing and especially

543
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:02,040
when we talk about you know, the cloud gaming and the Netflix style model of video games,

544
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:09,720
it makes sense. It is the future of games. So I'm not surprised. So online multiplayer is not

545
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:16,200
quite the name brand future feature, even though they all charge for it, the name brand feature

546
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,600
that it used to be so I get that they're, you know, compiling it all into one program, but it

547
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:27,560
does it feels a little weird with Xbox Live. But such such as life things change things rebrand.

548
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,080
It happens. All right. Well, speaking of things change, you might remember last week on the show,

549
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:40,680
we were talking about towards the end of the show that like, hey, by the time we kind of get to

550
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,400
the show next week, we're going to be looking at emerged activism, Blizzard, Microsoft,

551
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:52,600
psych, here we are. It's been a week that did not have years later. I know, right? Well,

552
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:59,000
apparently an extension has happened, but it's only a two month extension. Here's what happened.

553
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:07,160
So they were supposed to hit that target of July 18 to merge the companies. But because of the CMA

554
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,800
over in the UK, the competition in the markets authority because of that block still being in

555
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,600
place, and they have not found that workaround yet, even though now they are past all the hurdles

556
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:22,840
in the US. So you know, even with the FTC turn up, it's done. It's going to happen in the US,

557
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:28,280
the UK CMA is the sole holdout. But because they haven't worked that out yet, they have

558
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:37,320
made an agreement. So Microsoft, Activision, and the CMA have actually basically extended that,

559
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,680
you know, it's going to take, I guess the extended of the deadline for the final decision is now

560
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:51,000
August 29. So because of that, Microsoft and Activision are going to extend their completion

561
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,960
deadline further out. There's big penalties if the companies do not merge. And I don't think that's

562
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,440
because of a court thing. I think that's because if Microsoft pulls out of the deal, there'd have

563
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,720
to be a huge fee paid. I don't see us going down that bridge. This is now about what is the UK

564
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,200
going to do and what does Microsoft soon to be Activision Blizzard do in response?

565
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,720
Because if the CMA does not reverse their decision, I think we're likely to see

566
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,840
some pullout in the UK, which could be very, very, very interesting.

567
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:30,360
But as of now, nope, no merged company. And now we may have to wait till the end of August. So

568
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:37,560
maybe by the time we get to Labor Day, we'll finally be talking about this. Goodness.

569
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,280
All right. Well, speaking of decisions in the UK that are a pretty big deal,

570
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,480
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

571
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:53,160
Well, the UK has been deliberating over what to do about the whole loot box situation. Is it

572
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:59,560
gambling? Is it a gateway drug, slippery slope, blah, blah, blah. Some countries have already

573
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:05,800
flat out banned them like Belgium and the Netherlands. But their culture secretary,

574
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,520
Nadine Dorries, said that because they were still gathering evidence,

575
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:17,640
they said direct government intervention may risk unintended consequences. And that's a quote.

576
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:26,360
So they've actually agreed on some principles. So the first is a commitment to make available

577
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:33,080
technological controls to restrict anyone under 18 from acquiring a loot box without consent or

578
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,800
knowledge of a parent or guardian. So a lot of the controls are already there, but they're not

579
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:47,880
used very widely. So these would basically set up a best practice for parents. And then a second is

580
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:55,080
to make people more aware of these controls of the public information campaign and setting up a panel

581
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:04,600
to share, again, those best practices. Basically, game companies will have to disclose the presence

582
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:10,200
of their loot boxes before someone chooses to buy a game. And the games will have to show clear

583
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:21,240
probabilities before they buy a loot box. So basically, they also are working to enact more

584
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:28,200
lenient refund policies for these. And then they also want to tackle the black market that's around

585
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,120
loot box purchases. They are going to be monitoring it for the next 12 months

586
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,720
and seeing what the results is.

587
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:40,940
Interesting.

588
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,520
Apparently, there's people who already have an addiction to loot boxes,

589
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:53,320
who have taken out loans to get content in games via loot boxes.

590
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:53,820
Yeah.

591
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,720
And it really, for them, it is the same as a gambling addiction.

592
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,360
Interesting. I did not realize, I mean, I was gonna say I did not realize there was a black market

593
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:09,160
around loot boxes. But yes, of course, there is because I do remember years ago, you got to way

594
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,720
back when everybody was getting their Xbox 360s hacked. That was all part of loot boxes on the

595
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,920
black market. They were buying EA FIFA packs, and doing shady stuff with that and selling those

596
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,200
accounts. So interesting. I just never thought of black market regulation as a part of it. But I

597
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,200
guess that's some good news in that.

598
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:31,400
Or even people selling, you know, their systems with save files on it, because it has

599
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,640
out of print material on it, like the PT thing with PlayStations.

600
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,440
Or a flappy bird on a phone. Yeah, it's true. It's true.

601
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:51,400
Which came back. I mean, people are gullible. But I mean, it's just more or less opening the door

602
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,840
for exploitation. And people are always going to jump on it.

603
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,840
Yeah, it's true.

604
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:02,280
You can't regulate greed. You can only curb it via regulation.

605
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:09,240
Good point. Comment from message when I'm 100. Matt in chat says, got to be honest, I kind of

606
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,800
missed the loot boxes in Overwatch, not the buying part. But getting the boxes and getting the random

607
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,800
skins and so forth were a lot more fun than the battle pass thing. I might agree with that,

608
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,200
actually, is that like the battle pass is kind of meh. I think it really depends on the game,

609
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,520
though. It really depends on the game. Like I if they did loot boxes and dead by daylight, I'd be

610
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:35,080
annoyed. So but Overwatch, it doesn't bother me. So I would, I would wish they had they'd have a

611
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:42,120
system similar to among us. I, you know, I had just started playing that last week. And I like

612
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,280
the progression system where you earn points. And then you kind of like, it's almost like a skill

613
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,920
tree, the unlock stuff as you go along. So it's like, Oh, I can get this skin by to unlock this,

614
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,920
this, this and this person, but you're still getting stuff along the way. And they reward you

615
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:59,080
But you're still getting stuff along the way. And they reward you for playing, which,

616
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,600
I mean, I think that's kind of really easy to get in that game.

617
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,240
Yeah, exactly. So like, I, I wish it was like that type of system. But,

618
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,960
you know, they need, they want the money. But like, even with that, though, like there was

619
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,320
skins, like, isn't what you're talking about very similar to the combat crypt in Mortal Kombat with

620
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:24,840
like 1000. Maybe I don't know what like, there was like, and I wanted those from among us.

621
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:29,000
So I bought the pack for it. And then it gives you like a new skill tree thing that you can

622
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,760
unlock stuff in. And I think that's cool. Like, that should be the way it's done. At least that,

623
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,920
you know, it's like, okay, I want a thing. I know what I'm getting with that thing. But they're not

624
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,080
giving me that thing right away. You still have to earn it through like gameplay, but at least

625
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:48,840
it's like stuff you can unlock. So the other awesome thing about it is that you can pick

626
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:56,200
which set of skills or items you're unlocking by choosing which path you're walking on at that

627
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:02,920
time. And I think that that's great, because it can let people focus on, you know, I want

628
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:09,640
stuff for my healer, let's have a healing tree. I want stuff for, you know, melee, let's have a

629
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,720
melee tree. That would be great. Yeah.

630
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,360
All right, well, let's move on. The UK is really dominating gaming news this week,

631
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,160
because this next story is about them too, right? Logie?

632
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:30,200
Yeah, so there is a, basically, I think, like a regulation, that's a mandate that's passed the

633
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:36,600
European console, or council that is basically requiring that all batteries that are in appliances,

634
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,360
light transport vehicles, I'm assuming, like they said, electric bikes, electric scooters,

635
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:47,720
that type of thing. And other devices should be removable or replaceable by the end user.

636
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:55,160
I think it's to basically eliminate some of the waste that goes out there. Like so for example,

637
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,360
like if I have a controller for my PlayStation four, something like that, the battery dies in

638
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:05,160
it, I got to replace the whole controller. Unless you know, I go and take it apart. But now they're

639
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,000
saying, oh, well, yeah, we'll just have, you know, a replaceable battery, then you can put a

640
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,400
new battery in there. And it's good as new. So if this goes into effect, the thought is, well,

641
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:21,800
maybe then if it's a regulation that now game consoles, like, namely, the switch will have to

642
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,400
put out a version that has a removable battery, or whatever the switch Pro is that comes out,

643
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:34,440
we'll have to have a battery that is removable or serviceable by the consumer. Which is good,

644
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,800
I think they should do that. I remember old cell phones used to have that is is good,

645
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,320
because I bet a lot of these devices with the batteries embedded, you know, even though

646
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,600
s 200. Matt says I had to replace a bunch of my handheld batteries because a bloat or not not

647
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,440
being able to hold a charge lately, Nintendo makes it more or less pretty easy to replace batteries,

648
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,520
just a few screws, and you're done PSP even easier mobile phones are more of the problem.

649
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:59,080
I bet in any of those cases, people just throw the shit away. And I don't think that's particularly

650
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:04,120
great. So I think this is good that they're gonna make make it very easy to flip out the

651
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:10,200
battery that it needs to be sure. Yeah, my PSP is I had a few of them. And I think I had to throw

652
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,920
all the batteries away. I hope I've thrown all the batteries away for those because yeah, they do

653
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:22,440
blow up after a while. And same with phones. I think the phones for sure. You may be it wasn't

654
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:29,000
even that long ago where we had stories about Apple throttling their phones because batteries

655
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,560
wear down. And so it was causing the newer operating systems are causing, you know, battery

656
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:42,440
usage to be greater. And so they would throttle it to allow, you know, the older phones, I guess,

657
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,000
to be able to work along or whatever the case may be. But it's kind of almost like a planned

658
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,720
obsolescence at that point, because there's no such thing. There's no such thing as planned

659
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:58,760
obsolescence. Pretty much. It's just the way I don't think so. There's certainly there's

660
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:04,760
a lot of things that you buy now that don't last as long as they used to if you were to buy them,

661
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,200
you know, several decades ago, it's just several decades ago, they didn't have as delicate

662
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,680
technology as they do now. Yeah, but not even necessarily delicate technology stuff like we're

663
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:20,360
talking like dishwashers and you know, major appliances and stuff like that, like a lot of

664
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,480
that stuff last. I'm sure there's a lot of people that have like an old refrigerator that is you

665
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:31,240
just kick it away. Whereas you buy a new refrigerator craps out after like a few years.

666
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:36,760
So it's it I think there is obviously there's companies are going to say, Oh, yeah, we're

667
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:42,280
planning to make something obsolete. But at the same time, there is planned obsolescence. I mean,

668
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:48,600
with even like, not talking even hardware, like looking at, you know, a lot of phones,

669
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,000
after a while, they stopped receiving updates for their operating systems. And so basically,

670
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,280
it's like, okay, we got to buy a new one if you want those new features, because we're not going

671
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,920
to support the old one anymore. And I get it because it is processing power and all that type

672
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,640
of stuff. But I actually think of I think the most egregious example is not in the in the

673
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:12,440
universe. I think it's the K cups is what I think of. Yeah, that's the one that I go, Oh, no, that

674
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,760
was that was dirty what they were doing there. You know, because at least at least with phones,

675
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,280
or whatever you want to name, you can technically still use those devices, you can play whatever

676
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,600
games time on them. With the K cups, they were literally trying to say like, if you have an old

677
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:30,600
Keurig, you're not even going to be able to buy new coffee cups to use with it. That's kind of

678
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,880
what I would put in there. So tell me do cars today take the same tires as a 1969 Mustang?

679
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,760
No, no. And why? Because the way the cars are built today are built better with different

680
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,800
tires in mind. So I mean,

681
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:55,320
things are going to change and move. It doesn't mean that it's planned to fail.

682
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:05,160
There's also not designed to last though, like there's there could be precautions or like steps

683
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:11,240
are taken to make a product last longer, but it's not in their best interest to have a product last

684
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,680
longer, they want to last a decent amount of time. And then you'll buy a new one from them is

685
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,960
and Rama said it said it exactly right. As OS is get more advanced, older hardware can't support

686
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:28,840
it exactly. And I have seen what happens when people try to hack their systems. To put will

687
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:35,240
put like hacked versions of operating systems on and then see them struggle. See the the firmware

688
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,840
for it cause all kinds of problems with their system because it's not built to accommodate it.

689
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,200
I mean, it's just the nature of technology, it's going to move on past the hardware.

690
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:51,880
They can also design the hardware to be able to be upgraded. Like for example,

691
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,600
there are phones and laptops that they have very few that have replaceable parts,

692
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:03,160
including the processors, how long those base last before the new parts aren't going to work with

693
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:08,440
them. I think I thought of something very important with all of this because my brain

694
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,760
was thinking about well, okay, I mean, you have PlayStation, PlayStation two, PlayStation three,

695
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,600
PlayStation four, and by the time PlayStation, you're not making original PlayStation. But

696
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:25,320
here's the thing that is making that all different now, the cloud. Because why did something what was

697
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:31,560
a big selling point of stadia in the first place? Oh, even on this oldest Chromebook,

698
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:36,120
you can run Google stadia and run the newest games on this because it's all in the cloud.

699
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,360
So I, in a way, this this cloud direction that we're moving in, in a way I think is

700
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,360
actually kind of an obsolescence breaker in an interesting way.

701
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,080
Not necessarily, because even so, even playing it in a browser,

702
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:58,840
there's still going to be some limitations on you say that the base game to play it effectively,

703
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,640
even in a browser requires eight gigabytes of RAM, and you're on the system that only has four

704
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:09,720
is not necessarily going to run, say that playing through like, actually, I'll put it right now,

705
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:16,120
say that on GeForce, say, if you have, you know, very weak internet, you're going to get that pop

706
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:20,920
up that says the game is shutting down, your internet connection is bad, you won't be able

707
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,480
to use the service, there's still going to be a technological requirement, even for cloud based

708
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:32,840
gaming. Anyway, I was somehow we hopped over to this from the replaceable battery thing in game,

709
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:39,560
I think, or in consoles, I think at the end of the day, I'm, I think for the environment concerns,

710
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,680
I think it's probably the best because there are too many people. What all of you are saying in

711
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,920
chat is true about how easy it is to replace the batteries and some of them that is still too

712
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:54,200
difficult for a lot of people that would just throw the damn thing out. And so I think this

713
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,600
is a really good way to help ward off electronic waste at the end of the day. But we'll see. I mean,

714
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,400
but we'll see. I mean, maybe it's just buying time too, because inevitably, I get the rest

715
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,880
of the conversation we've been having. Inevitably, these devices will get probably thrown out anyway,

716
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,880
as they become obsolete. But I think it buys a lot of time. I don't know.

717
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:18,600
Well, I think that more companies to go along with that need to adopt the same kind of policy

718
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:27,720
that the place I work for has where, by 2030, there's going to be a zero carbon footprint.

719
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:35,800
Every piece of technology that's put out there is able to be brought back in and recycled

720
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:44,280
for zero waste in production of new materials. Because now there's so much out there that any

721
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:50,360
of these items can be turned back in through a native recycling program. And like, hey,

722
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:56,520
we'll give you a gift certificate for the value of whatever you're bringing back in,

723
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,400
for the value of the parts of what you're bringing back in, recycle the parts, put them into the new

724
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,520
machinery. And that way you keep operating at a lower cost, one thing, because you're not

725
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:13,160
needing to buy new materials, just the whatever it's going to cost to recycle them. And I think

726
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:18,520
every company needs to have a mandatory recycling program. Like, hey, you done with your Xbox,

727
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:24,200
and you don't want to sell it to a kid down the street? Send it back to us, and we will recycle

728
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:29,880
it for you. And it will become somebody else's Xbox, which Microsoft is, is there's several

729
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:35,320
companies have signed on to that Microsoft was one of them too. So yeah, of course, the name.

730
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:45,720
So um, but Oh, damn, what was gonna say with that? I'm very curious. I would think some states

731
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,520
are probably trying to pass laws around that too. I don't know to what extent they can,

732
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:56,920
I have to admit. But I do think about like, you know, the infamous California electric car law,

733
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,880
right, where like, all the cars sold in California have to be,

734
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:07,960
to some extent, electric by a certain year, which is going to be very interesting. So anyway,

735
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,800
I'm just curious, any new purchase of a car, right? No, yeah, it's not going to get rid of

736
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,440
old cars, but it's still gonna, you know, there's gonna come a point where gas stations are a thing

737
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:23,240
of the past. And so, or a niche, I say niche, there'll be a niche, like like diesel pumps,

738
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:29,320
or well, that's not that's, I was just reading an article where Switzerland and I think Norway

739
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:35,800
are doing the induction charging roads. They're starting to do them. Oh, that's cool.

740
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:42,680
Yeah, which I think, I mean, if we incorporate that, just I mean, it's going to be expensive.

741
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:50,200
But if they implement that, you know, let's just say California wide, since we have that law,

742
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:58,280
then it's, I mean, first of all, I think that they're also using more durable materials than

743
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:06,200
simple asphalt. Yeah. And the fact that the charging system is going to basically

744
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:15,560
remove so many different sources of emissions. And not just that, but those charging stations

745
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:22,120
won't need to be as necessary and, you know, have people take up space parking and all kinds of-

746
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,680
God, could you imagine- There's more to it, but I'm sleepy.

747
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,840
Yeah, no, so I was like, could you imagine if I5 was just a giant charging through all the

748
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,760
poo poo cow farms that you try to throw the way to Disneyland? Or yeah, or the 99?

749
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,080
It's like F zero. Yes, it is. It is literally like F zero.

750
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:44,360
Maybe they were onto something with that. All right. All right. Let's move on and talk about

751
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,080
something that you may not want to replace if it inevitably ends up getting rid of it. And that is

752
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:56,040
your Ubisoft account. Apparently Ubisoft is going to be suspending inactive accounts. This could be

753
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:02,040
very bad if you have games that you've purchased attached to it. Some emails have been spotted

754
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:07,400
going out. There's a Twitter user that posted a screenshot of an Ubisoft support email that said,

755
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,640
your Ubisoft account has been suspended for being inactive. If you don't log in in 30 days,

756
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:17,480
it will be closed permanently. Yikes. That's very bad if you have purchased games on it.

757
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,440
Now it's important to note, this doesn't mean that not playing it for 30 days makes it go inactive.

758
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,280
In fact, the official time period, we're still trying to figure out exactly what that is. Some

759
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:31,080
people were saying it's like up to four years or something like that. But still just that whole

760
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:37,400
fact that Ubisoft is looking at possibly closing inactive accounts, even if games are on them.

761
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,880
That is a little bit weird to me and kind of, I feel like it's gonna scream class action lawsuit.

762
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,520
And yet I know, I know, when you agree to buy games digitally, you have this, I know,

763
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,720
you don't have to, but I'm telling you, do you think that's going to stop a class action lawsuit?

764
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,640
If somebody loses their, you know, five year old copy of, you know, Rayman or whatever, you know,

765
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,880
they bought on Ubisoft some time ago. Go back and play Assassin's Creed 2.

766
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:08,360
Yeah. But I know Italy for you. I did sign into my Ubisoft account just so I was like,

767
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:12,120
Oh, maybe I should do that because it's been a while. But then I realized it actually hasn't

768
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:18,280
been that long. Because I if you have PC game pass, and you've played anything on Ubisoft,

769
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:24,600
such as Oh, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, through that, you're gonna have logged into the Ubisoft

770
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:31,160
thing relatively recently. Or in tried and chat says, Yeah, I just threw it away. It didn't look

771
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:36,440
like you were using it anyway. Yeah. dark to see it says I know they had a bunch had a bunch of

772
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,680
freebie giveaways that I just have sitting there. Yeah, I think a lot of people probably built out

773
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:45,240
built up free stuff on their account. And it's probably an Ubisoft's best interest to get rid

774
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,920
of those accounts that are just sitting there. It still seems a little bit shady to me. Whether it's

775
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:58,440
legal or not, it just seems shady. So it is shady and end of it. But I have a feeling that they're

776
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:04,600
doing it for I mean, it's it's, I don't think they're doing it as any sort of like malicious

777
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:11,400
action or anything or to. I mean, it would be a good way to promote people to go back and and

778
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:18,280
give them their products more more views. But at the same time, I'm sure that these accounts with

779
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:24,440
data storage are taking up space. Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to give them a benefit of a doubt. But

780
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:31,080
typically, I don't because it's Ubisoft and we know what has happened. Yeah. And to be fair,

781
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,400
that Ubisoft said I wouldn't even call it up forward, whatever the fuck they call that thing

782
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:40,360
to be soft forward. Okay, whatever it's called has probably seen more users on it in the last

783
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:45,320
two days since this news story came out than it has in the last two years. Because everybody's

784
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,000
logging in to make sure they don't lose their account. So I don't know, maybe the whole thing

785
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:55,640
was a genius evil plot. Who knows? sjo 100. Matt with a with an excellent point I agree with in

786
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:01,960
our chat room saying should delete eavesgimaw for being inactive and caring about Ubisoft's employees

787
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:10,920
preach. Well said, well spoken, agreed, cosigned. Yes. All of that. Let's move on to some news that

788
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:19,640
could potentially be a little more exciting dark soccer. Well, this is news from a leaguer. So take

789
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:27,080
it with you know, an entire salt lick. But there is a rumor that Sega is bringing back altered

790
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:32,760
beast and Gunstar Heroes, which I mean, first of all, that's going to make my husband really giddy

791
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:40,920
because he loves Gunstar Heroes. But altered beast is, you know, wise from your grave.

792
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:50,120
But yeah, they are looking to go back into their back catalogue and see about making new projects

793
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:59,800
out of it. There's not really a whole lot about that. But there is a player survey out and about

794
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:08,360
for gathering feedback to see what people would like to see more of and mention among them is,

795
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:15,480
of course, the Sonic series, Yakuza, Valkyria Chronicles, Phantasy Star, and a few more. In

796
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:19,640
fact, one of the questions I'll just read the entire list. What games do you want to see more

797
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:24,920
new content for? Sonic the Hedgehog, Yakuza, Super Monkey Ball, Bayonetta, Gunstar Heroes,

798
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,800
Shinobi, Jet Set Radio, Phantasy Star, Phantasy Star Online, Sakura Taisen or Sakura Wars, Shining,

799
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,960
Altered Beast, Retro Fighter, Streets of Rage, Valkyria Chronicles, Puyo Puyo,

800
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:43,480
Project Diva, Shenmue, Football Manager, Total War, Golden Axe, House of the Dead,

801
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,920
Virtua Tennis's Crazy Taxi, Other. So hell yeah, Other.

802
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,000
Yeah, I'm totally down for Other. That's right.

803
01:15:54,520 --> 01:16:04,200
But Other too. I think that the Gunstar Heroes one though is pretty good for this house.

804
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,960
I think the Altered Beast concept is pretty cool too though. We haven't seen that series in a long

805
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:13,000
time. I'd be jazzed to see Altered Beast may come back. But I'm also very much, and I'm sure we all

806
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,840
are on the same page and start to see it in our chat, who says, Dear Sega, do not, and I can't

807
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:27,640
stress this enough, fuck up a new Gunstar Heroes. Truth. Do not. I mean, I still want to see

808
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:34,200
like a treasure delve, you know, back into their old stuff, like bring us out a

809
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:42,760
modern cleaned up version of Silhouette Mirage or was it Doki Doki Mischief Makers?

810
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:50,440
You know, I think that our Chameleon Twist or, you know, actually re-release

811
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:56,280
Radiant Fucking Silver Gun, and not 50 bajillion copies of Ikaruga, please. That'd be nice.

812
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,880
I really love the idea of an offline Phantasy Star game for a change, you know, and we've seen

813
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:08,680
Phantasy Star single player games that were kind of modeled after the online ones because they

814
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,920
had that PS Vita Phantasy Star game. Now, of course, I can't remember the name of it,

815
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,600
but of course, Phantasy Star universe was kind of in two parts. There was the online mode,

816
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:21,480
and there was an entire single player mode as well in that game. I'd dig a new offline

817
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:25,240
Phantasy Star to be honest. Not that I dislike the online ones. I just would be curious what

818
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:30,760
they do with it. It'd be very interesting. Yeah, and I agree with Rama and Quest Buster,

819
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:36,200
basically like going back to the roots of Phantasy Star 5 would be badass, I think.

820
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:48,360
So we'll see. All right, Loki. All right, so we talked a while ago now, I think we mentioned that

821
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:55,640
basically Epic is opening up Fortnite to allow folks to create their own games within Fortnite,

822
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:03,560
kind of like Roblox a little bit. Well, now we have word of a veteran FPS dev that's forming

823
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:09,160
a new studio to actually do that. They are going to be making games within Fortnite.

824
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:20,360
The game that they're talking about is Outlaw Corral, which is like a Western 1v1

825
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:26,600
FPS game. Doesn't sound that great, but you know, that's fine, I guess.

826
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:34,920
But yeah, you can check it out. They have like an island code that you can look at the game, but

827
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:42,760
I mean, cool. This doesn't look very good, you know, in my opinion, but I mean, it's neat to

828
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:50,040
see like people actually adopting, you know, that platform. But yeah, the fact that they have a code

829
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:54,440
to look at the game instead of like a direct link or something like that kind of makes it difficult

830
01:18:54,440 --> 01:19:04,040
to discover things in my opinion, but neat. Yeah. Very interesting that I think it's more

831
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:08,600
interesting that we are seeing commitment to Fortnite as a game development platform.

832
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,640
I guess I'm not surprised, but it's kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, this is

833
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:19,400
happening. Oh, this is, we've got commitment. This is something, this is not something where it was

834
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,400
a flash in the pan we talk about at one time, like, oh no, people are going to make games for

835
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,520
this. So we're going to be talking about the future, which is interesting to me. So we'll see.

836
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,920
Yeah. And while this is an interesting story, as far as like this game being in there,

837
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:35,880
what's actually been more popular recently, which is, should be no surprise is a clone of Only Up.

838
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:42,040
And I'm going to tell you, like, if it's anything like Roblox is, clones of other games are

839
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:46,760
basically what you're going to get a ton of in these things. It's just going to be, it's rife

840
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:53,080
with copyright infringement, left and right. Like just blatant free for all.

841
01:19:53,080 --> 01:20:00,680
Yeah. All right. Well, moving on to another story here, before we get to something classic,

842
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:06,120
I want to talk about a very interesting future for Blizzard games. You know,

843
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,760
Blizzard has historically had its own launcher for games, the Battle.net launcher. Remember when

844
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:15,240
they tried to change the name of that and the users made them change it back to Battle.net?

845
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:19,640
Well, Blizzard has announced that some of their PC games are going to be going to Steam.

846
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:24,200
That's right. Overwatch 2, which is, you know, probably a game that needs a bigger audience,

847
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,040
will be coming out for Steam on August 10th, although they have not committed to anything

848
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:33,000
else for the platform yet. In a press release, President Mike Ibarra from Blizzard said,

849
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,200
we've heard players want the choice of Steam for a selection of our games. However, something

850
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,920
important to note, even though Overwatch 2 is available on Steam, you have to have a Battle.net

851
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:48,920
account in order to play the game. Buy stuff in it. Battle pass. Hello. But also cross-platform

852
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:55,240
play. So to be fair, we've seen Blizzard do a lot more cross-platform games with things like

853
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:00,120
Overwatch 2, right? That was a big deal, is that unlike Overwatch 1, Overwatch 2 is all

854
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:06,200
cross-platform now, as is Diablo 4 versus Diablo 3. So I can see why this is happening now,

855
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:11,000
because Blizzard has that more infrastructure in there for that cross-play. So it's interesting.

856
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,840
But yeah, if you're trying to do this to avoid Battle.net altogether, for whatever reason you

857
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:23,160
may have, I don't think this is going to work. But maybe you want it on your Steam deck. That I could

858
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:28,120
see. Now Blizzard did not officially announce Steam deck support, but that doesn't mean people

859
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,880
are not going to do whatever they need to do to get it running on that. So that part is going to

860
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:37,400
be very interesting for sure. Overwatch 2 is also getting a big update on the same day, August 10th.

861
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,280
That is the day that PvE missions are supposed to start, as well as the new PvP mode and a

862
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:50,840
new hero. It's all called Overwatch 2 Invasion. So that is on the way. What is less on the way,

863
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:55,720
unfortunately, it looks like there's been about 50 esports staff at Activision Blizzard that were

864
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:05,000
laid off around the Overwatch League. The OWL, or Overwatch League, may be changing significantly.

865
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,840
It may be ending the city-based franchise format. Nothing is confirmed yet. But employees were

866
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,520
informed of layoffs on Tuesday, and a former member of the team told The Verge in an interview

867
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,000
that layoffs are out of nowhere, and that a skeleton crew might close out the current

868
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,440
Overwatch League and World Series of Warzone seasons. But in a quote saying,

869
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:31,960
in my eyes, they are completely unequipped to internally support anything esports after that.

870
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:41,960
Yikes. So this all also is on the piggyback of Overwatch League waving the franchise fees for

871
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:48,440
teams. Yeah, it looks like they may be trying to consolidate some teams and maybe not do so much of

872
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:59,400
the city-based format. It was at a strong start, but I kind of think the pandemic really kneecap

873
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:05,720
this thing, among other decisions. It went off of Twitch, it went to YouTube, and it kind of

874
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:13,000
keeps moving around. Some were aired on ESPN. I think the grand finals are on ABC at some point,

875
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,280
but then COVID-19 happened, and it changed a lot of that. And I don't think it's been able to find

876
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:26,040
its footing ever since, quite frankly. So we'll see. We'll see what happens for 2024 and beyond.

877
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:32,440
But does it end up going the way of Heroes of the Storm? I hope not. That would be very bad news

878
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,800
for Overwatch players. It's very sad with Heroes of the Storm. Heroes of the Storm still exists,

879
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:45,240
but if you look at the map for BlizzCon, there's nothing Heroes of the Storm on it,

880
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:50,840
which isn't surprising. But Overwatch has two halls. When SG100map points out,

881
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,400
going to be honest, Overwatch 2 being kind of lackluster also hurt it. And that is very true.

882
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:59,640
People did not respond to Overwatch 2 the way that I think Blizzard expected them to.

883
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:06,680
Changing the feature set probably didn't help, but that all plays into it as well. So

884
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,040
we'll see what happens. I mean, I've played a little bit of Overwatch and it's fine,

885
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,520
but I also haven't given Overwatch any money since I bought the original game when it was

886
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:22,760
the more traditional model of a $50 game to buy. And that was how many years ago at this point?

887
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:27,880
So I'm going to be honest, I'm not going to buy the battle pass. I'm not really interested in any

888
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:35,800
of that stuff. So we'll see. We'll see. All right. Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane in our

889
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:41,480
next segment to a time when we didn't have to worry about season passes, battle passes,

890
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:46,200
esports, none of that. It was a very different time. So let's roll the bumper.

891
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:01,960
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

892
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,840
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

893
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,200
And what did you pick this week, DarkSakura?

894
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:20,760
Live Alive, the original from 1994 for Super Famicom. It was developed by Square

895
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:31,400
and it's a very interesting game. I had started playing it back in the day and never

896
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,080
really made it that far. So now I'm officially playing it and have made it through

897
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:40,760
the prehistoric part of it, which we're actually watching right now. This is actually what I

898
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:48,280
streamed on yesterday, Saturday. But anyway, it came out in 94. It's a role-playing game

899
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:55,080
developed by Square for the Super Famicom. Yes, there is a remake that was done by Esquenix

900
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:00,520
for the Switch that came out last year and also then PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows.

901
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:09,800
So it follows seven different scenarios across different time periods with two other unlockable

902
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:19,480
scenarios that link all of these narratives together with this reoccurring antagonist named

903
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:27,080
Odio. You explore for a little bit and have different story twists and then there's

904
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:32,600
turn-based combat that's played on a grid and it's kind of weird. I'll just tell you right now.

905
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,680
It took a little bit to get used to and it's really frustrating when you're trying to move

906
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:40,920
into position and then somebody attacks like someone else and you have to wait to make your

907
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:48,760
move. It's ridiculous. But the game was really well received. The unique gameplay and the narrative

908
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:56,280
was also very highly lauded though the game is not a very long game. The remake was also brought

909
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:03,640
in very well. Although some people are saying that there are some gameplay elements that did not age

910
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:12,360
well. The original sold 270,000 units and was considered a failure. However, the remake sold

911
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:31,320
500,000 copies. Also, the director Tokida Takashi went to use his time from Live Alive

912
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:37,800
into other games. The brief run-through on some of those other games we are looking at

913
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:45,400
Final Fantasy III on NES, Final Fantasy IV, V, Chrono Trigger,

914
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,600
Parasite E, Chocobo Racing. I'm trying to find some more recent stuff.

915
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:59,080
Final Fantasy IV DS, Final Fantasy IV The After Years, Dissidia Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Curtain

916
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:07,880
Call, The New Live Alive, Future of the Final Bar Line, Octopath Traveler 2. So, those are

917
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:14,520
other things he's been involved in. At any rate, you basically take a role of one of eight different

918
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:20,920
protagonists through nine scenarios. So, each narrative does have the same basic mechanics.

919
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:28,280
Each of the story has different gimmicks. One can use stealth. One can use telepathy.

920
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:36,440
With all but one scenario, you are navigating through themed environments from an overworld

921
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:41,720
area to dungeon environments and the battles are triggered differently for each scenario.

922
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:49,720
Some are random. Some have sprites you can avoid and others are very well scripted. For example,

923
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,640
do you see, well, I mean, for those who are watching how you see these little

924
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:01,480
clouds poke around, you actually sniff to find out where your enemies are and so you

925
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:05,480
have an idea of how to go right into a battle or how to avoid one.

926
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:16,040
For the record, the cave people speak in thought bubbles and grunting and smelling.

927
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:25,000
Yeah, they have smell-o-vision. It is a turn-based system for the fight and you're on a seven by

928
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:32,200
seven grid where you can move around, perform different actions like attacking or healing or

929
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:39,080
different ranged works. Your skills can use without limit, though some do take multiple

930
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:45,560
turns to charge. And some of the abilities can give you extra properties such as

931
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:51,080
dealing elemental damage or healing or increasing your power.

932
01:29:53,240 --> 01:30:00,840
You also gain skills with experience points that unlocks new abilities. Some of the progression is

933
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:07,320
locked away behind story events. Sometimes the techniques are learned by watching other people

934
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:13,880
use them. And then you can also equip and use items and have accessories that boost your attack

935
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:21,640
or other items to recover health. And if your character or the party is defeated, the game ends,

936
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:30,280
of course. So the remake has the basic gameplay carried over, although it's a new graphic style.

937
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:37,960
And some of the changes are just there for ease of use. You have like health bars and whatnot,

938
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:43,000
but honestly enough, I kind of liked getting the alert right at the beginning of the match

939
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:49,560
and then just trying to mentally keep track of it. So the different chapters that you have,

940
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:55,640
and I know I've kept mentioning the prehistoric, but you also have ancient China, feudal Japan,

941
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:01,800
the wild west, the present day, the near future, and the distant future.

942
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:14,120
And the protagonist has to fight an enemy whose name is or incorporates ODIO. Like the last one

943
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:23,880
in this one was O-D-O or IO or something. It was like that. There is an eighth chapter set

944
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:29,240
in the middle ages, which in turn will unlock a final chapter that brings all the narratives

945
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:36,920
together. So in prehistory, you play as Pogo with his ugly ass gorilla friend named Gori.

946
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:46,920
And you have to rescue a girl named Belle. They say Beru here. I've always just known

947
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:54,840
to this Belle. But she was supposed to be sacrificed by the rival tribe to their

948
01:31:54,840 --> 01:32:05,160
dinosaur god, Odo. Get it? So all the same names. You have an Oloshihu in the imperial China,

949
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:12,440
looking for a successor. The Edo Japan, the infiltrator, you have a ninja, a Boromaru,

950
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:17,720
having to rescue an important person and kill the captor.

951
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:31,960
And the wild west, you have the wanderer who has a showdown. You have the strongest who is

952
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,360
in the present day with this guy who wants to be the strongest person in the world, thinking

953
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:41,320
that defeating enemies in each fighting style will help them get his goal. The near future is

954
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:52,600
the outsider with a psychic named Tadokoro Akira. You have the distant future, the mechanical heart,

955
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:59,320
where you're on a ship called Cognito Ergo Sum, I think therefore I am. And you play a maintenance

956
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:05,320
robot named Cube. And then in the middle ages, you play the knight Orsted. And I won't go more

957
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:10,600
into that without going into spoiler territory. Anyway, it was developed by development division

958
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:17,480
five of Square, also the folks who did the Final Fantasy series, and was the directorial debut of

959
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:23,880
Tokida Takashi, who had also worked as a designer for Hanjoku Hero in Final Fantasy IV.

960
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:31,960
And the concept was born from when they make an RPG where people could experience multiple stories

961
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:39,240
at once instead of the smaller stories going into a grand narrative. And it was made by expanding

962
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:46,520
the storage capacity of the Super Famicom ROM so that players could finish each part during the

963
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:54,920
day. And for the record, I finished the caveman in basically two and a half hours. That's even

964
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:03,880
with having to start over on part of it. The designer for this was Inoue Nobuyuki and the

965
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:11,560
programmer Fukuye Fumiaki. They had also worked on those other games with Tokida,

966
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:20,280
and they began development December 1993. And the whole thing took a year and a half and was

967
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:29,720
produced for a Super Famicom 16 megabit cartridge. But Tokida had to adjust to being a director. He

968
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:36,360
was more used to being hands-on for graphic elements. And so the hands-off approach was

969
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:43,640
a little bit hard. And originally the scenarios had a graduating difficulty scale, but it was

970
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:47,960
abandoned so that players could tackle the scenarios in any orders that they wished.

971
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:57,800
And basically, the battle system in there was intended to be a strategic experience,

972
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:04,760
and Tokida described it as real-life shogi. So that's kind of cool. And they wanted to not

973
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:10,200
show the hit points, but have the characters act like they had been injured or looked weakened as

974
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:19,160
they took damage. And then, of course, after it was done, the team split up to do other projects.

975
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:28,840
And I'm not going to go too much more into the characters on there, but some of the

976
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:34,120
characters were based on pop culture figures. Like, for example,

977
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,880
one of the characters was based off Oda Nobunaga.

978
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:50,440
One of the characters was also working on Basara and lended her work to the character design.

979
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:59,400
And Orseb was directly based on the Warrior of Light from the Final Fantasy series. So,

980
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:05,960
anyway, we also had influences by Devilman, Dragon Quest IV, First Human,

981
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:16,600
Giatris, and also some nods to Stanley Kubrick in there. So, anyway, the music in this game was also

982
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:24,200
done by the amazing Shinomura Yoko, who had left some of Capcom's projects after working on Street

983
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:31,000
Fighter II and moved to Square to do music for RPGs. And Live Alive was her first major RPG

984
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:41,320
composition, which I believe I mentioned in a previous episode. So, of course, there was also

985
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:47,640
some input by Uematsu Nobuo, as in the Final Fantasy composer who helped her out with

986
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:56,120
getting everything laid out. And some of the songs in the game were available as downloadable

987
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:03,640
content for Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call, and some of the songs were included in

988
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:12,120
a tribute concert. So, Live Alive was released on September 2, 1994, meant to be released before

989
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:22,440
Final Fantasy 6, but there were delays, and so it was released after that. But there was

990
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:33,000
a prequel manga that preceded the distant future scenario, and that it was actually

991
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,080
done without Square's permission. The game was re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console for Wii U

992
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:48,760
on June 17, 2015. Virtual Console port to 3DS was November 28, 2016. And then more people were

993
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:55,400
demanding the title, so they had to get permission from the guest illustrators and make sure the

994
01:37:55,400 --> 01:38:02,600
re-release could happen. And the characters from Live Alive were featured in the 20th anniversary

995
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:08,760
crossovers with the mobile game Holy Dungeon and Final Fantasy Legends The Space Time Crystal.

996
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:14,280
So, the remake, I'm not going to go too much on the remake because that's not classic yet,

997
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:21,880
but the remake was built using Unreal Engine. Everything was updated in it. It had in-game

998
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:29,320
radars and maps, and the character designs were redrawn by Ikushima Naoki. And, of course,

999
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:36,120
Shinomura came back to orchestrate and rearrange the soundtrack. The original MIDI sound files were

1000
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:44,360
lost, so basically she had to copy from the original and remake them. There's also the New

1001
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:52,040
Future chapter had a vocal version of the theme Gogo Buriki Daioh, and it was done by Kageyama

1002
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:58,840
Hironobu, who is best known for performing the Dragon Ball Z opening, Cha La Head Cha La, which

1003
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:06,360
is actually one of my favorite anime openings ever. But, anyway, you know, like I said, not the best

1004
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:11,960
received, but it was generally favorable. I can already tell just from playing through the

1005
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:22,280
caveman scenario why it never got a US release, you know, between gorilla humping and eating

1006
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:29,240
people and the naked man who wears a thong made out of a lizard, a live lizard, and explosive fart

1007
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:37,240
jokes. Yeah, probably a reason. But, yeah, that's the game. Live Alive. I will, if anyone's interested

1008
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:44,680
in seeing it on Tuesday, I will be starting. I think I'm going to do the cowboy, so be there.

1009
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:50,600
All right, yeehaw. There it is. Not yeehaw people, but just yeehaw.

1010
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:57,160
Classic game of the week, Live Alive, which is, yeah, I keep meaning to check out the remake

1011
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:01,720
at some point, and I just haven't gotten around to it because, you know, endless backlog of games.

1012
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:10,920
It happens. Yeah. Hey, Rob, real quick. Yeah. I found out that there are now analysis applications,

1013
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,280
one of them by Intel, that's meant to search for deep fakes.

1014
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:22,600
Basically, it's combatting AI rendered video. Perfect. Perfect.

1015
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,000
But I've thrown that in since that's been a point of contention.

1016
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,280
Yeah. By the way, before we get into rapid fire news, you know, I know we've been talking about

1017
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:34,280
that I'm going to this convention this upcoming weekend, and I got Dragon Con. I should also point

1018
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:39,800
out, and I was going to ask, because Alan and I got our TwitchCon tickets this week. Did you pick

1019
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,680
yours up yet, DarkSucker? I assumed you were going. Maybe I shouldn't assume.

1020
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,240
I did.

1021
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:43,800
Okay.

1022
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,560
I did, and now that's why I'm doing marathons so that I can actually eat

1023
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:53,960
while I'm there and do my cosplay. But yeah, I bought my tickets.

1024
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,460
Nice.

1025
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:02,040
I believe it or not, I've actually made enough this year so far that I could buy my tickets

1026
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,520
flat out.

1027
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,080
Oh, that's great.

1028
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:03,800
I was very happy.

1029
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:08,440
Congrats. So that's awesome. Well, TwitchCon Vegas is coming up in October,

1030
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:11,720
so that will be another opportunity to see myself in DarkSucker, although we don't

1031
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:18,760
really work with it in any official capacity or anything like that. So it's what it is.

1032
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:30,520
All right. And Bobby, no. So moving on, let's get into rapid fire news.

1033
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,120
So, Loki, we'll start with you.

1034
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,840
All right. So Death Stranding DLC, or I guess bonus content, is coming to Fall Guys.

1035
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:51,400
So I really like the Sam Bridges costume that they have with the teeny tiny little bean baby

1036
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:57,800
that's in there. That's pretty awesome. But yeah, you can get the standard issue Bridges

1037
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:07,240
SDT suit that's in there. And yeah, looks cute. When is it coming? It's already come out.

1038
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:12,440
It's part of the July 18th update. So nice.

1039
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:16,840
Great. By the way, Loki, I completely see what you did there. You switched the game behind you

1040
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,880
to one of the many Barbie video games there at some point.

1041
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,320
It's Barbie Horse Adventures.

1042
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:25,880
All right. Perfect. Perfect. All right. Moving on, DarkSucker.

1043
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:35,160
So if anyone is a fan of the Google Doodle, there is Space Invaders World Defense, actually, which

1044
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:43,720
is an augmented reality version of the game and has worked with Taito for mobile devices.

1045
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:50,200
So this is actually being put out by Google for the 45th anniversary. This is basically

1046
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:57,960
much bigger than just having the doodle to commemorate it.

1047
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:06,280
But you basically can go around shooting Space Invaders in real time using your phone. Huzzah.

1048
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:12,520
Good times. Yeah, I downloaded that to check it out. But it didn't look like it actually

1049
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,640
used like landmarks or anything. It was just more of an AR Space Invaders game,

1050
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,160
which was cute for a minute.

1051
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:21,320
I mean, that's what it was described as. So I guess it did the bill.

1052
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:27,080
Yeah. All right. And then one more thing to talk about. And that would be, do you remember a few

1053
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:31,640
weeks ago when we were talking about the surprise that the Dolphin emulator was going to be coming

1054
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:38,440
out for Steam and we were like, Valve's going to allow that? And as it turns out, LOL, JK,

1055
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:45,640
Valve is not actually going to allow it at all. What happened in this case, there was no DMCA or

1056
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:51,160
anything like that. But Valve's legal department did contact Nintendo. And there was, you may

1057
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:56,760
remember this, they did reach out proactively to see about this whole thing. Valve forwarded

1058
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,960
a statement from Nintendo's lawyers to the Dolphin team and said they could only launch the emulator

1059
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:10,440
if Nintendo approved. So the part of the legal letter said, we specifically request that Dolphins

1060
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:15,800
coming soon notice be removed and that you ensure the emulator does not release on the Steam store

1061
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:21,320
moving forward. And does that surprise any of us? Probably not. I think more of us were surprised

1062
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:25,880
that it ended up on the store in the first place, but it will not be coming to the Steam store.

1063
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:32,120
On a related note, Nintendo has still not done anything to address the lack of backwards

1064
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:39,400
compatibility and playing some of the old games on these systems. But I guess some people just don't

1065
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:46,520
care about that. Moving on, let's check out what is coming out around the world in a segment we

1066
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:55,480
call world release dates. So Loki will go to you. All right. So we've got a few games. So starting

We've got Let's School on PC, Pixel Junk Scrappers Deluxe on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

love this on the Nintendo Switch, You Suck at Parking comes out this week on the Nintendo

01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:23,160
Switch. Oh man, that's the game that all the Americans play. I know, several people that

1086
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:27,160
need that game. Well, you could, it's a multi-language edition, it isn't limited to

1087
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:31,320
Japanese, but yeah, You Suck at Parking is coming out from GameSource Entertainment,

1088
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:36,840
and yes, it is not a racing game, it's about parking, so. Anyway, also coming out on the

01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:41,240

1094
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:09,800

1095
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:16,120
Cry Machina also out on the PS5, that Hayarigami 123 Pack is out as well,

1096
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,880
all that in Japan this week. Pretty busy week, all things considered.

1097
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:25,320
S2100 Matt in chat says, remember you park like an asshole. I used to have those fake

1098
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:30,200
ticket printed up to put on folks' windows. No, but, and I know I've told this story on

1099
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:35,000
the show before, I'm going to tell it again, I remember the first Live 365 Awards that we went to

1100
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,320
when we parked next to some guy that parked like an asshole and Dark Sakura left them a note on

1101
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:43,160
some Hello Kitty post-its that I had in my car that let them know you park like an asshole.

1102
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,480
Do you remember that? I remember that too because I thought it was the funniest thing

1103
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:50,440
because I just, I happened to have Hello Kitty post-its.

1104
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:58,360
I remember, you remember my friend Julie, right? Of course. I saw her a year ago at a Pokemon ride.

1105
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:05,080
Really? Well, I just remember that she and I were taking the same Japanese class

1106
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:14,280
and someone had just parked completely impossibly bad, like really bad. And she took out honey

1107
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:25,960
packets and poured them all over the handle of their car door. And then put salt on it.

1108
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:30,520
Yeah, I'm passive aggressive notes. I can't get sued.

1109
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:31,480
Don't piss off Julie.

1110
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:31,980
Yeah.

1111
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,240
That's, that's, that's Julie anger.

1112
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:38,760
All right. How about the UK release dates, which hopefully don't lead to anger.

1113
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:47,720
All right. On the 25th for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, we have Remnant 2.

1114
01:49:48,520 --> 01:50:00,520
On the 27th for PlayStation Switch and Xbox, Double Dragon Gaiden, Rise of the Dragons.

1115
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:09,560
Also on the 28th for Switch, we have Disney Illusion Island, PlayStation Ghost Song,

1116
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:14,040
and for PlayStation and Switch Cuphead limited edition.

1117
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:19,640
All right. All right. We just have a few more news stories for you, and then we'll see if

1118
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:24,200
anyone wants to give us a call tonight over on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com

1119
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:31,080
slash discord. But first we do have some more news and this game keeps trickling out the news

1120
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,640
to keep it as a headline every week. Pretty exciting. Yeah.

1121
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:38,760
Yeah. So there was a whole rumored story about Homelander joining Mortal Kombat. Well,

1122
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:46,440
that's not all. So they finally made the announcement of the Mortal Kombat, their first

1123
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:54,040
DLC pack that's gonna contain well, Homelander from the boys. And then a really awesome matchup

1124
01:50:54,040 --> 01:51:02,600
with Homelander's Omni-Man, who is from the show Invincible. And, you know, also voiced by JK

1125
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:13,160
Simmons. So it's gonna be amazing. Then we have Peacemaker, Quan Chi, Ermac, and Takeda.

1126
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:20,760
Oh, well, that's cool because I kind of missed having him in the last Mortal Kombat,

1127
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:23,880
in Mortal Kombat 11. There was a lot of talk of him.

1128
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:30,920
Yeah. So there's a whole like there's, I remember like with like Invincible and the boys and stuff,

1129
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:35,880
there was all these like kind of like fantasy matchups like, well, this Superman type character

1130
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:39,880
versus this other Superman type character and they're both evil. Who's gonna win? So we're

1131
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:46,680
gonna see a lot of, you know, Homelander versus Omni-Man. It's gonna be amazing.

1132
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:54,920
And I don't know when it's coming out yet, but it looks fantastic. Oh, September 14th

1133
01:51:55,720 --> 01:52:02,040
is when Mortal Kombat 1 releases. And then the combat pack, not sure when that's coming out yet.

1134
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:07,320
I would feel like it's gonna be there the day it comes out, but maybe it will be.

1135
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:11,960
Maybe. Yeah. And it comes with the collector's edition or premium edition as well.

1136
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:18,120
Yeah. So, but that's right around the corner, but that's how they do those games. NetherRealm

1137
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:20,680
just announces it like three months before it's gonna come out. And then they just,

1138
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:24,440
they hit it hard with the announcements leading up to the release date. They actually do a really

1139
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:30,280
good job of teasing and releasing their games. So I would love to see like a whole versus series

1140
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:36,040
with all these different superhero shows. Like let's get, let's get like Invincible versus,

1141
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:41,240
you know, the boys versus, I don't know, whatever else. Throw them all together. Hey, hey, you know

1142
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:46,200
what? Let's just bring back heroes. Why not? Let's have heroes come back in too. And then just have

1143
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:50,040
a big fighting game with all these different superhero TV shows. I'd be down with that.

1144
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:54,360
Def points out, we'll probably get more news at Evo, which yeah, that's coming up

1145
01:52:54,360 --> 01:53:01,160
first weekend of August. So that is a very, very good forecasting as well for sure.

1146
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:01,660
Yeah.

1147
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:06,760
All right. Well, I think this is, this next story is really funny to me. Dark Sakura.

1148
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,160
Neopets. I had them. You had them.

1149
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:16,760
I had them. Yeah. All the omelets for my Neopets.

1150
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:23,560
Neopets are going through a reinvention and I don't know how I feel about this artwork.

1151
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:30,760
In fact, I don't really care for it. I liked the old artwork. So anyway, the,

1152
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:40,840
the new management behind that is looking to reinvigorate the world of Neopia. On July 18th,

1153
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:51,000
they they had the world of Neopia which had a lengthy blog post by the Neopets team that was

1154
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:57,240
talking about the future of the franchise, the abandonment of Metaverse and NFT plans.

1155
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:01,240
So yeah, I'm not interested the moment that NFT got brought in.

1156
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,480
Well, good thing it's leaving.

1157
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:07,800
They basically fixed the flash problem.

1158
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:08,300
Yeah.

1159
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:11,580
Yeah.

1160
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:12,620
Oh, good.

1161
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:25,080
And wow, $500 Neopets NFTs are no, no thank you. But basically after fixing the flash thing though,

1162
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:35,400
is that they're two big initiatives were pretty much hated. The thing that they had released

1163
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:41,960
didn't line up with the things that made people like Neopets. And so they're dropping whatever

1164
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:47,800
that was. And they're going to do a mobile game called World of Neopets, which is a social life

1165
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:53,000
simulation game where you live your ideal Neopian life from the perspective of a Neopet.

1166
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,840
They're still leaving though the old Neopets

1167
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:07,160
are intact. And they're going to do some things with the old style one. The new site

1168
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:13,000
was actually should have launched a few days ago, July 20, to be a one stop shop for all

1169
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,880
brand announcements and all the stuff. So I don't know how I feel about it. You know what?

1170
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:25,720
Well, it's, I'm happy that evil was defeated with NFTs. So that's, you know, and it's it,

1171
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:31,000
this is not the first time we've seen the gaming companies retreat from NFTs now recently. So I

1172
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:38,680
feel like this, like this NFT thing was a flash in the fucking pan. Like it, it's, yeah, it's

1173
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:43,880
going as far as leaving as fast as it came in. So don't let the door hit you.

1174
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:48,600
All right. Rest in pyramid heads lasagna.

1175
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:49,980
Loki.

1176
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:57,400
All right. So apparently there's been a leak of some of the developer data on Roblox. So there

1177
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:04,040
was about 4000 developers who had their personal identifiable information leaked to the public.

1178
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:10,840
These were folks that attended the Roblox developer conferences between 2017 and 2020.

1179
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:16,200
And it had everything basically all of their personal information that you could imagine

1180
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:21,720
that would be in there. They said even they kind of brag about the ridiculousness of it,

1181
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:28,920
even t-shirt sizes. So apparently they have notified everybody that has been affected by it,

1182
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:39,960
but you know, it still sucks. So they pledged to continue to be vigilant. But you know,

1183
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:45,480
all the vigilance that you can possibly muster is not going to help it when all their personal

1184
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:50,200
information is leaked out. SSJ 100 Matt sums up the

1185
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:53,080
comments on this article perfectly by saying, Oof.

1186
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:03,400
Exactly. That comment's really funny. It is pretty good.

1187
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:08,280
It's pretty good. All right. That should really just be the headline. All right.

1188
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:15,000
Moving on to one more story. Another one of these things that, you know, is showing up in our

1189
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,880
industry more and more is AI, or machine learning, if you will, but we all know everyone's calling

1190
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:26,760
it AI. I think this is really funny. So some Redditors have ended up trolling a content farm

1191
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:32,440
to report on a fake World of Warcraft feature that doesn't actually exist.

1192
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:40,840
Okay, so there's this website called the portal, which is a blog that publishes gaming content

1193
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:47,320
powered by z league. That is basically all just cover for machine learning AI generated bullshit.

1194
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:54,520
But what's funny is that so so a Redditor noticed that the portal website was taking discussions

1195
01:57:54,520 --> 01:58:00,600
from gaming sub subreddits and turn them into blog posts. So what they did is that they made

1196
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:08,360
a fake post and other Redditors played along, as did Blizzard developers in this whole thing.

1197
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:15,080
And sure enough, article gets posted World of Warcraft players excited for Glorbo's

1198
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:27,000
introduction. Glorbo is not anything that actually exists. So um, but now of course, now this is the

1199
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,080
big joke. Now everybody's talking about Glorbo. And now here we are talking about Glorbo. And

1200
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:38,440
guess what it doesn't fucking exist. So a Blizzard has actually been contacted to see if

1201
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:44,280
they will actually address the hype for Glorbo and bring the feature into Wow, it would be a very

1202
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:49,640
funny like they can't actually do it as a feature but it would be a really funny like pet flavor

1203
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:55,400
text or something like that like something just a little wink and a nod I think or an item like

1204
01:58:55,400 --> 01:59:00,840
Glorbo's ring of sorcery or something would be really funny to put in the game at this point.

1205
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:07,160
Didn't they do that with like the sword that was supposed to be in that South Park episode?

1206
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:11,480
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, they do that. They do that shit all the time. All the time. Bobby

1207
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:17,880
Blackpool points out that the article actually references the AI bot. So this is a great way to

1208
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:24,280
break AI bots. And I think it's funny and we should keep doing it. CNET had to correct AI

1209
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:33,160
generated finance posts because errors were found. Gizmodo, Geo media had that forging ahead with AI

1210
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:37,880
generated blog posts, even though they got things wrong, like a chronological list of Star Wars

1211
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:44,760
movies and TV shows wrong. AI is not ready in the way that companies want it to be ready. And I think

1212
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:53,000
they're going to find out the hard way about this for sure. So Bobby says they then made another

1213
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,360
post on Reddit worrying about AI bot news sites. And the same site made a post about wow players

1214
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:03,640
worried about AI bot news sites. This is so good. It's getting so meta. Yeah. They just,

1215
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,880
then they need, what they need to do then is reference that site and discuss about that.

1216
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:12,680
And then it'll go one step deeper and they just have to keep going with it. Yeah. So,

1217
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:20,040
it doesn't seem to be going anyway, away anytime soon, but some, some folks are believing, you

1218
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:24,200
know, if you want to, you know, believe in the future of AI, some believe that AI could help

1219
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:28,440
combat misinformation by, you know, assisting newsrooms with fact checking, but, you know,

1220
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:33,560
I'll believe when I see it, cause right now it's not there yet. So, but we'll see, we'll see what

1221
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:39,080
can come of it. I think it just depends, again, it depends on how the machine learns. It's very

1222
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:43,720
clear that this thing got its pants pulled down for pulling all of its information from Reddit

1223
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:48,920
and everything that was generated from there. So, Bobby actually links us to the article.

1224
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:54,120
Oh yeah. This is great. So, this is from an archive cause obviously I'm sure the article

1225
02:00:54,120 --> 02:01:00,440
got pulled at some point, but this is actually at the portal where Glorbo is introduced into the

1226
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:05,720
game. And again, it's, it's the most generic thing where it's just like, wow, players are buzzing

1227
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:10,600
with excitement because this introduction it's there. Here are the key takeaways like,

1228
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:18,200
like an AI bot would do. Some players have reservations about the mandatory item,

1229
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:24,680
kick clack. That's gotta be a rearranged letter word of something. I don't know. This is really

1230
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:29,960
funny. Glorbo's impact on the game. Honestly, this new feature makes me happy. I just want

1231
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:34,280
some major bot operated news websites to publish an article about this.

1232
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,400
Oh, it's funny.

1233
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,440
Ah, it's so good.

1234
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:45,720
Keep it up. Keep it up, Reddit.

1235
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:46,840
But it really isn't good.

1236
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:51,400
No, the prank is good. The prank is good.

1237
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:55,800
The prank is great, but I mean, and it really does bring attention to it,

1238
02:01:56,440 --> 02:02:01,960
but at the same time, the fact that it exists, that it's trying, you know, that people have

1239
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:08,920
programmed it to basically try to beat a human reporter to the punch.

1240
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:17,320
No, I think it's great that it catches this company with its pants pulled down and just

1241
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:24,680
shows how this can be exploited. Big issue with machine learning and learning. You can exploit it.

1242
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:29,880
That's what this shows right now. So just food for thought, food for thought.

1243
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:36,120
All right. Anyway, with that, let's get to the list of round table where we invite your calls

1244
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:42,040
over at vognetwork.com slash discord. We also invite your emails every week to our mailbag,

1245
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:47,400
participate at orange lounge, radio.com. And we like to read those emails on the show.

1246
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:50,040
Dark soccer. Did you want to do that now? Or you want to finish eating while I bring on a collar?

1247
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:52,520
Okay, so let's get to it.

1248
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:55,400
It's got pepperoni on it. So now it's making me kind of meh.

1249
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:04,840
All right. First email. Would Silent Hill 3 be the first of what we refer to as mascot horror

1250
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:10,920
games? Or is there a significant predecessor? That's from Robert M. Kinda. I mean, it's not

1251
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:18,600
really the first. We had splatter house. Oh, good call. And of course, I mean, any of the

1252
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:24,120
games that were based off the movie franchises, you know, I mean, even Halloween had a game.

1253
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:30,760
Nightmare on Elm street had one. There was a Friday the 13th game. Not that they were any good,

1254
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:37,640
but. But yeah, I mean, I think splatter house is a great call out.

1255
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:42,120
Yeah. Splatter house was the first one that comes off of my head. I mean,

1256
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:49,320
you also think about early Diablo. Oh yeah. Yeah. Think about.

1257
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:56,440
What about like phantasmagoria? I don't know if that's not really,

1258
02:03:56,440 --> 02:04:01,800
I think that's phantasmagoria. Really have like a mascot to it. Although I love phantasmagoria.

1259
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:09,640
That's a great game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was. Well, I mean, doom kinda.

1260
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:15,800
I was trying to think if there's anything from that PC, like CD rom point and click era,

1261
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:18,840
you know, when I think about things like seventh guests, but I guess, I guess it's, you're right.

1262
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:24,120
It's not really like the brand is the kind of the mascot. They're not really any particular

1263
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:27,800
character. Like I couldn't tell you what the main character's name was in that game at this point.

1264
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:35,960
In golden acts, death adder. Oh, okay. But that's not, that's not

1265
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,400
horror though. I don't know. Well, I loose interpret it loose.

1266
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:45,880
Medieval horror, I guess. But I mean, but yeah, splatter house would be the first one

1267
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:48,440
that came to mind. Yeah. No great call. Great call out.

1268
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:57,400
All right. So next email. Hey yo, O L R doing my part and emailing the show

1269
02:04:57,480 --> 02:05:02,680
with a fun question and also sent us doggos. Thank you for the doggo. Doggo is cute.

1270
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:10,120
Lego has been venturing into gaming theme sets in recent years. Most notably they have themed

1271
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:14,680
playsets of super Mario brothers, as well as scaled builds of actual consoles like the NES,

1272
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:19,800
the Atari 2,600, and recently a Pac-Man arcade machine with moving functions.

1273
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:26,680
So my question to you all is what gaming series or gaming inspired set would you like to be

1274
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:33,240
seen, uh, would you like to see be made into a Lego set? I personally really like the console

1275
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:38,360
builds with the movable actions, like the NES TV. So I would like to see maybe a classic game

1276
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:46,120
boy build with a small crank function, granted the beauty of Legos that one could make their own set,

1277
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:52,040
but I just prefer throwing money at Lego whenever possible. Haha. Anyways, thank you for the show

1278
02:05:52,040 --> 02:06:00,440
as usual. Be well and stay awesome friends. SSJ 100 Matt. Um, great question. Um, I went a

1279
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:07,880
Silent Hill diorama. That's a good one. I'm going to be predictable and say Metroid. I think for me

1280
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:12,120
that's pretty predictable. Um, but you know what, you know what random like thing popped into my

1281
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:18,840
head was Faxanadu. Um, that is very random. I know, but like, remember like some of those,

1282
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:23,480
like the trees and the way the stages were built. It was, if you remember the, the Lauren that game

1283
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:26,520
was about like climbing these trees and things like that. I don't know why. Like, I just think

1284
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:29,880
that would make like an awesome Lego set, but you know, you want it obscure. Here you go.

1285
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,400
I think we're gonna, I mean, I would be really surprised if they didn't do a Legend of Zelda

1286
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:41,320
set at some time too. There is, there is supposed to be one, it leaked out. It was the, uh,

1287
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:47,560
great Deku tree. Um, that was going to be the thing they have like product shots of it. They

1288
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:53,240
just haven't announced it yet. Um, so that is coming. And remember there was Overwatch,

1289
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:59,560
there is Super Mario Brothers stuff. There's also Sonic coming very soon. So they've done a lot in

1290
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:05,880
gaming recently. I would like to see something along the lines of, um, I'd like them to do a

1291
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:12,680
pinball machine, like honestly like a functioning pinball machine. Yeah, they could do it. Get some,

1292
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:17,000
like, uh, they're like, not technics stuff. I mean, it would be some technic stuff in there,

1293
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,920
but like some of the stuff that they have with like the robot creation sets and stuff

1294
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:26,360
where you could really get it to be functional. Well, I know people have made them, but like,

1295
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:32,040
I mean, I want to see Lego make one. Um, I think it would be really cool, uh, more practical,

1296
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:40,280
like Mega Man or, um, you know, Zelda. It was actually themed around their, uh, astronaut

1297
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:48,600
made with 15,000 bricks and this thing would be pretty damn expensive, but I'll,

1298
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:54,280
I'll link it in the chat room for whoever wants to see it. Um, it's pretty cool.

1299
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:59,560
I would love to have like there, you know how they did do the, the Pac-Man one, like it's,

1300
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:04,920
it's fun as the crank stuff goes with that, like team up with one of those, like console,

1301
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:09,080
like the tiny little console makers and make like you build the cabinet, but it's an actual

1302
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:13,400
full functioning little mini cabinet or something like that would be really cool.

1303
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:18,520
That'd be great. As big of a fan of the cabinet ones. I mean, I think that they're neat looking,

1304
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:24,200
but I would rather have just like a nice diorama. I really would like to have a nice diorama.

1305
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:38,120
Um, so, uh, next up, um, come on, open up. Um, hi, OLR. I have just been a podcast listener

1306
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:42,760
for a very long time. The live show is just too late for me. You have been a part of my

1307
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:48,440
podcast rotation for 15 plus years. I'm not sure how long, but I found this show back on all games.

1308
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:55,640
10 years ago in 2013, my wife, Tracy died. That time I did call in. I remember that.

1309
02:08:55,640 --> 02:09:00,360
Now I have the best news ever. Last month, my daughter brought my first granddaughter

1310
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:05,000
into the world. I'm so happy for the addition to the family. I'm not really gaming right now,

1311
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:12,200
but I do keep up on the news with OLR weekly. Thank you for all you do. I don't know if I

1312
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:18,040
should say the full name, so I'm just going to see Steven. No, I definitely, I remember that call

1313
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:23,960
because, um, that was, I'm sure an incredibly difficult period, um, for you to go through. So,

1314
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:29,400
um, you know, I'm, I'm glad to hear things are, are great these days for you and that you have,

1315
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:33,480
uh, the family continuing to grow. That's great. Thanks for reaching out. Cause I believe this was

1316
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:39,320
the only emailer that actually listened to my pleas for lurkers to email us. So Steven,

1317
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:44,040
you get the gold star email of the week award. Yay. Although I appreciate the other emails as

1318
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:49,720
well. We do hear from those individuals, uh, somewhat frequently. So I appreciate

1319
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:54,600
a lurker, uh, un-lurking to, uh, send that other email. I want to say that we made friends through

1320
02:09:54,840 --> 02:10:03,560
live journal. Oh, I'm sure. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. With this person. Yeah. Um, I'm pretty sure I see them

1321
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:10,840
on the book of faces too. So, um, and for the record, I have started the disentangle my

1322
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:17,720
entanglement process and I'm taking the bird with me. Oh, oh, the bird app, which actually is not

1323
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:22,360
going to be the bird app as of, you know, tomorrow. It sounds like, cause now it's, you know,

1324
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:28,920
X marks the spot for the term has become a generic. Yeah. It's ingrained. It's like

1325
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:34,360
Xeroxing. I'm always going to call it bird app. Here's the thing it's for, as far as I'm concerned,

1326
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:38,920
it's Arco arena. And if you live in Sacramento, you a hundred percent know, like we all do,

1327
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:41,960
you a hundred percent know what I mean when I say it's like Arco arena, because

1328
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:46,360
where the Kings used to play, not their current place with the beam and all that shit,

1329
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:51,480
but where they used to play, uh, in, in a little bit more of a suburb area of Sacramento,

1330
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:55,880
though it's still considered Sacramento proper, the big arena. Yeah. The big arena that they

1331
02:10:55,880 --> 02:11:02,440
built there was called Arco arena was actually the first sponsored name arena in history.

1332
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:08,120
Fun fact, because what happens there? I think, uh, no, cause it's now a pile of rubble. Uh,

1333
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:14,360
it is going to be a hospital soon. Yeah. But, uh, so Arco arena, they lost the naming rights.

1334
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:17,640
Fun fact, it was going to be the seven up arena. And at the last minute, the,

1335
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:21,320
the naming deal changed. I know somebody who was on the deal for that. I learned all these

1336
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:25,880
useless facts about it, but anyway, the name like Arco is gasoline. If you don't already know,

1337
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:30,440
cause I don't know if that exists nationwide, terrible gas. Yeah. We Alan and I call it PP gas,

1338
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:35,720
but it is it's cheap cause letting your car run on PP, but it is cheap. Very, very cheap gas.

1339
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:38,840
I don't know if it's nationwide or not. So that's why I wanted to give that explanation.

1340
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:46,120
So, um, yeah. So the arena was called Arco arena, but then they lost the naming rights after like

1341
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:50,520
10 years or something like that. And it was called, I think, wasn't the name after it,

1342
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:55,160
power balance, balance. Pavilion. Wasn't that the next name, which was after those

1343
02:11:55,160 --> 02:12:00,440
fucking wristbands or something that were like, it was terrible. And then I think it became this

1344
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:05,880
like, and what happened was that everyone refused to call it that it was still Arco arena,

1345
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:09,880
even though they would welcome you to, we'd say, uh, yeah, it's Arco arena. Yeah. Nice try. No,

1346
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:15,160
we're not calling it that. And then it was sleep train, which ended up getting an amphitheater.

1347
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:19,640
Yeah. Which, uh, which was train amphitheater was something else. No, it was both. They had

1348
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:23,800
both. That's what made it confusing. They had the amphitheater out in Yuba city, rural area.

1349
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:27,560
And then they also had the arena. So you had the sleep amphitheater and the sleep train arena.

1350
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:32,040
And then mattress firm bought sleep train, but they never changed the name.

1351
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:37,800
It was still the sleep train arena. No, it was Arco arena. Yeah, exactly. No,

1352
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:41,880
it was always a forever Arco arena. And they finally bulldozed Arco arena

1353
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:46,120
last year because it is now going to be a hospital Arco arena hospital.

1354
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:52,200
People are going to have babies born at Arco arena.

1355
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:56,600
Are they still going to do like the monster jams in the hospital?

1356
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:02,360
It's going to be their big fundraiser event is having that out in the parking lot.

1357
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:09,880
No, all the monster jams and shit happened at the golden one center, which is the new and that

1358
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:14,360
funny enough, people don't call that Arco arena. No, that's the golden one center

1359
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:19,080
because that's downtown. That's just the downtown Plaza.

1360
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:23,720
Actually, I do know plenty of people that still call that the downtown Plaza.

1361
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:27,800
I still call it downtown Plaza and I'm not even from here.

1362
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:31,640
Or is it the K street mall? Like, I don't know what they call it. All of it. All of it is

1363
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:37,640
acceptable. And I'm just like the mobile old sack. So a non Sacramento version of the reference that

1364
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:42,680
I think more people would understand would be candlestick park. Exact same thing happened

1365
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:48,200
with candlestick park. Remember when candlestick park was like monster.com park? I think at some

1366
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:51,960
point, do you remember that? I've purged that from my memory.

1367
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:58,120
Exactly. Cause nobody fucking ever called candlestick park, anything but candlestick park.

1368
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:04,280
They bulldozed candlestick park. Yes. I know you mentioned it. That's why I brought it up.

1369
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:08,040
They bulldozed candlestick park like several years ago. Like Paul McCartney was last play

1370
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:11,240
there. I heard they were going to put houses or condos there. I don't know if the pandemic

1371
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:15,320
slowed that down or what, but they still have it. It is just a bunch of empty land. Do you know

1372
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:18,440
what that empty land is called? Candlestick park.

1373
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:19,240
Candlestick park.

1374
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:28,840
All right. Yes. As you're 100 Matt, you got your sports ball, but it should look,

1375
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:34,200
here's the thing. Was the last event at candlestick park sports ball? No, it was not.

1376
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:40,120
It was a Paul McCartney concert. Fun fact. Uh, what was the last event at Arco arena?

1377
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:44,200
It wasn't sports ball. I think it was also a concert of some sort.

1378
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:52,280
Hold on. You know, Arco arena has its own, um, Wiki page and it's under Arco arena. It's not

1379
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:55,720
It was really brothers Bardem and Daley. Really?

1380
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:57,880
It was, it was, yeah, it was the circus.

1381
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:01,080
Of all the things they could have done there. Sleep train arena.

1382
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:08,440
Oh, you know what else though? That became the makeshift hospital. They, it had a moratorium on

1383
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:12,280
the bulldozing because they made it. Remember when they were really worried about tons of

1384
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:17,640
people being hospitalized, that became the overflow hospital. Arco arena was the overflow hospital.

1385
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:23,960
So ironically, ironically, yes, Arco arena was a hospital. And from what I understand,

1386
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:30,840
one person used the services. One person. But I, you know, I don't give it too much shit because

1387
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:34,520
they were preparing for much worse. And I think we need to give that credit, you know, that they

1388
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:40,120
were ready to go. Um, but that now that I think about that is ironic. Arco arena kind of foretold

1389
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:44,520
its future by becoming a hospital there at the end, didn't it? Right. Anyway.

1390
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:50,360
Well, I know that they had, um, a, uh, a goodbye thing like last March.

1391
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:54,440
Yeah. That's what it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They had a goodbye event,

1392
02:15:54,440 --> 02:16:00,520
but the last official event to hire out the arena was, um, the circus.

1393
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:06,120
It's kind of disappointing. I don't know why. I think the circus is kind of silly now that I'm

1394
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:08,840
in my forties. Maybe if I was a kid, I'd be more excited. But

1395
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:14,920
anyway, uh, DJ says, what's the, Oh, nevermind. That's a response to something in chat. Cause

1396
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:18,680
I was like, we went over this it's for when it, when it's a hospital, it would be Arco arena

1397
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:27,400
hospital. All right. Let's get some calls. They've been waiting patiently for a long time. So I want

1398
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:32,520
to get them on the air. Hi, you are on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's the one and

1399
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:37,160
only Ron. How's everybody doing? It is so good to hear from you, Rama. And I just want to make sure

1400
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:44,040
we're clear. It is always, what, what do we call the new hospital? Go arena. That is exactly right.

1401
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:48,280
Good job. We're we're fast learners here at orange lounge radio. Appreciate that.

1402
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:54,840
What's on your mind tonight, my friend stuff. But first thing first, I want to thank Loki.

1403
02:16:55,560 --> 02:17:00,920
He, there's something he did on his YouTube page. That was a big save for me a couple of

1404
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:07,480
weeks ago when I was on vacation. What's that? I was, I went down to South Carolina and visits

1405
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:11,720
a friend of mine and I'll help her with her kids and all of that. Her kids had a, um,

1406
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:18,280
leap over and they were bouncing all over the walls. And I'm like, I got to get them to calm

1407
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:24,920
down. And I spoke to my friend's son. Like, what do you like? And he goes by crap. Haha.

1408
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:32,520
Well, they'll put our channel 64 out of peep out of them for hours. Nice job. Good. That,

1409
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:38,760
that is a true fan right there because you are living the spread the word part of that there.

1410
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:43,880
Okay. Nothing to put kids asleep to me rambling for like 15 minutes at a time about things that

1411
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:49,720
I'm doing. Okay. So I'm about to derail this entire fucking call right now, but you did call

1412
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:55,000
into orange lounge radio. Rama. I just noticed the cup you were sipping out of is a raising

1413
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,640
Cain's cup. Have they fucking infected New York city? Like the plague as well. Those things have

1414
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:07,000
showed up everywhere in the last like two months everywhere. My brother in Christ, they have a

1415
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,720
global flagship location in times square. Of course they do. Of course. How long has it been?

1416
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:16,920
How long has it been there though? A few weeks. And I went by there a few weeks.

1417
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:23,880
Let me tell you, I went by there cause I'm like, I went to the healthcare. I went to Zach's bees

1418
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:28,840
and then I'm like screaming at friends on Facebook talking about this is not the chicken y'all were

1419
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:34,040
telling me about. So y'all need to shut up. So I went to raising Cain's with a friend thinking

1420
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:39,800
we'll grab some takeout and then go to the bus. There was a line going outside and around and

1421
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:44,200
the place has been open for a few weeks. I'm like, I'm going to go, I'm going to order online,

1422
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:49,480
pick up my food, then go home. And that's what I did. And now they're opening another location

1423
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:54,920
in, I think around 14th street union, um, near union square later this year too.

1424
02:18:56,200 --> 02:19:00,840
I've never had it, even though it's ever, I drive by it all the time, all the time. And they,

1425
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:05,240
they just bulldozed a fucking Walmart and they're replacing it with Raising Cane's apparently.

1426
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:09,080
That's a big Raising Cane's. I know, right? I think something else is going there too,

1427
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:12,440
but like Raising Cane's going to be the parking lot or something wild.

1428
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:19,160
I think, I don't remember if I saw one in Alabama or I might just be thinking of Zach's bees.

1429
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:23,880
Well, anyway, I know you didn't call in to talk about chicken, but you know,

1430
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:27,960
uh, more chicken talk. What's on your mind tonight?

1431
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:32,120
A couple of things. Um, I want to talk about something that you brought up

1432
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:38,840
earlier tonight and something that I mentioned last week. Okay. Now we talked about loot boxes

1433
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:44,520
and addiction. Well, I got a story for you. I'm going to change the names on this to protect

1434
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:50,040
people. Good idea. I noticed how you said that you did not say the innocent.

1435
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,960
You just said, well, this person is far from innocent.

1436
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:59,480
Aren't we all down? So two friends of mine were going to get married and all that. And the wedding

1437
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:07,720
was, was postponed, canceled, whatever that down with my friend, me and Marco, she tells me that

1438
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:16,440
her now ex fiance slash roommate got addicted to loot boxes. I'm talking, he would not pay his own

1439
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:22,280
bills. He just kept throwing money into loot boxes or in this case, gotcha games, you know,

1440
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:27,160
game over. Would you like to contain you $5 for, and that's what he was spending his money on.

1441
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:33,160
Oh no. And the addiction got really bad. And my friend's father had sat down,

1442
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:38,200
had a talk with him about it. And he said he got better. Evidently he did not.

1443
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:47,480
He's I know he's better now, but basically his relationship is gone. Everything he works hard

1444
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:51,960
for. It's everything gambling edition. It's everything that you see play into that playing

1445
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:55,960
out there. That's that's unfortunate. I'm really sorry to hear about that. I hope, I hope he

1446
02:20:55,960 --> 02:21:04,440
got the help he needs. I borrows. I know he's in therapy for it, but I do not bring it up because

1447
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:09,720
he doesn't know that. I know that's for the best then. Yeah. Now,

1448
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:16,440
this is something that came up in a topic last week about the whole

1449
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:23,640
Microsoft acquisition and so forth. I had mentioned that while everybody I see on Facebook

1450
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:29,400
talking about the whole acquisition, nobody has said anything about the shit Bobby Kotick has done

1451
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:36,200
because, and I'm looking at it like, what's really sad is nobody in your friend group has said it,

1452
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:40,040
right? Because I'm like, you've listened to this show, right? Okay. Just making sure we're clear

1453
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:45,480
on that. Okay. Outside of y'all only like maybe 1% of people are talking about it.

1454
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:49,160
Okay. And it's more, the thing is more people is concerned about, they don't want Microsoft

1455
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:54,120
taking quality. That's what they're more concerned about as opposed to what's going on with Kotick

1456
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:59,880
and the harassment and so forth. Well, at least you underscore why the court case seemed to be

1457
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:04,520
all about call of duty. I mean, there, there was a reason for that and you, you kind of underscore

1458
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:10,520
that. Right. And the thing is, I'm thinking about if I'd never listened to OLR, I wouldn't know

1459
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:17,800
really check the game blogs as I used to. So even if I did, if I read an article about it,

1460
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:22,840
probably go through one ear and out the other where y'all y'all bring this up every day,

1461
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:27,160
because I think I'm saying things because it is something that needs to be discussed.

1462
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:31,960
Like I have a couple of friends who work at Ubisoft and they talk about how great things are

1463
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:40,040
for them. And I'm just sitting here going, Hmm, I say something or just mind my business and just go

1464
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:46,280
about my day. Respectfully mind your business and go about your day because maybe it is for them,

1465
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:51,400
you know, and even though the culture tends to trickle down from the top, because the company

1466
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:57,480
is nationwide and split up into smaller studios, it could be that wherever your friends are at in

1467
02:22:57,480 --> 02:23:02,360
the infrastructure, maybe is a little more insulated from other places. So if there's

1468
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:07,720
if they are happy, there's no need to poo poo on the parade. Yeah, it's not

1469
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:13,800
that. It's more like, I just want like, whoever is to know what's going on just be informed.

1470
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:19,560
Maybe the way I know myself, it's going, I just wouldn't know how. So I'm just like,

1471
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:23,880
what about like, hey, I heard like there was a you I don't know if this is actually true. I have to

1472
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:27,240
there's a union starting at Ubisoft. Is that something y'all are getting in on, you know,

1473
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:32,440
or something that that might be the way to address it instead of like, wow, I heard your CEO is a

1474
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:35,800
total shitlord who hasn't been accountable for the last four years. Like what the fuck's going on in

1475
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:41,560
that place? That's not going to work, you know, but maybe just kind of hint dropping at some of

1476
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:47,080
the ways employees are pushing back might be an interesting way to gauge it. Basically, yeah,

1477
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:52,680
for right now, as long as I see it, they're happy. I'm I'm not going to say anything. Yeah,

1478
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:56,440
but it's sort of like, it's like, it's like seeing two sides of it. It's like,

1479
02:23:57,160 --> 02:24:04,040
you know, this is going on. But when you look at people who are discussing it, nobody's talking

1480
02:24:04,040 --> 02:24:11,560
about like, it's a nonsensical thing, which in actuality, it is not, you know. Yeah. And I think

1481
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:17,800
God forbid you depending on what for what group you're in a page, you bring that up. It's like,

1482
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:22,520
hello. Well, no one you know, I'm just like, come on. Maybe maybe you should care.

1483
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:28,520
Sure as hell do. I know you do. I know you do. Well, Rama, I hate to wrap up,

1484
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:33,000
but we got one more call I got to get on. So any last minute thoughts for us tonight before I let

1485
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:42,120
you go? Oh, I am running out of space for Funko Pops, because I just bought one. That's my basic

1486
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:47,480
one of my TV crushes. So yeah. Okay, you know, I'm like, you're not gonna say that not tell us

1487
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:55,160
who the TV crush is. I'll tell y'all. Let me go grab it and well better. So Pena Lawrence from

1488
02:24:55,160 --> 02:25:05,320
boy. Hold on. I love it. Oh, I shall tell you later. I have a nightcrawler this this big.

1489
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:10,520
As long as you didn't say gambit then mako child won't be knocking on your door.

1490
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:15,480
It was never a gambit fangirl. It was always my blue fuzzy elf.

1491
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:20,120
I don't have any pop vinyls with crushes. But I do have Richard Simmons.

1492
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:28,120
Was I something for you, Rob? Oh, I have a mini Richard Simmons bubble bubble head. Yay.

1493
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:36,040
But um, talk to me later on Sean. I got some organizers on Etsy and I will link you to them.

1494
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:40,440
Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Because all I do now I just haven't been protective.

1495
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:46,520
Bad things that just keep them stacked all over my room on my little studio apartment.

1496
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:52,040
Shoot what happened? There we go. Okay. Anyway, Rama, I'm gonna let you go so we can get another

1497
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:56,600
call. Thank you so much. Take care of my friend. anime jam session. Listen to it or else. All

1498
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:03,720
right. Bye. Bye. All right. Let's get another call here on the air. Hi, you are on orange

1499
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:08,200
launch radio. Who's this? Hey, this is deaf. Hey, deaf. It's good to hear from you. What's up,

1500
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:16,920
my friend? Well, I wanted to talk about a recently released game that last year was

1501
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:25,160
released and didn't have that critical price. Which is choco Bo GP. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh,

1502
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:32,600
did you Okay, is this about the purchase of the new version of it? Yeah, I actually got the

1503
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:38,360
physical version. Though it's a it's an import. I actually have I think it's a

1504
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:44,200
yeah, it's a European version. Because in America, you cannot get it physical,

1505
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:50,840
a physical version on the digital. The thing the switch is region free. So you can buy

1506
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:59,640
the Korean version or the European version, it will work fine perfectly. But yeah, last year,

1507
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:06,760
if you remember, it's like, yeah, you can buy the game. But it's filled with microtransactions.

1508
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:14,440
It's filled with battle passes. It's, it's like not good. So heavily. It was so heavily into the

1509
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:21,080
into putting it more money that it needed to. So it's like, it was really a disappointment. But

1510
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:27,160
right now, it's like, okay, it has everything, you can unlock everything with the currency the

1511
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:36,440
game gives you. It is a grindy game, I will say it's like not it's not, you cannot get everything

1512
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:46,920
like really easily. But the game is fun. It's a really competent card racing game. It has like,

1513
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:54,360
it has the not necessarily easter eggs, but it has those references to Final Fantasy as a whole.

1514
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:59,160
And obviously previous or other chocobo games like Mystery Dungeon,

1515
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:07,640
chocobo racing even and in that. So it actually it is a fun game. It's like I was playing it last

1516
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:14,760
night with with some friends. We were playing the chocobo GP mode, which is like a battle royale

1517
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:26,280
thing. You have us you enter to a 64 party race, but it's divided in eight between eight players.

1518
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:34,280
So if you get to the top four positions or top four places, rather, you keep advancing until

1519
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:40,200
you get to the final round. And if you win, you then you win more points, you win more tickets,

1520
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:45,080
more money to buy more stuff. So it's it's really addicting to and in that sense,

1521
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:51,960
especially with friends, which because it's not that necessarily that the game is not populated

1522
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:58,440
online. It actually, I actually surprised that there's many people playing it. But every time

1523
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:05,880
my friends and I like were trying to group up, we did group up in the same lobby. So it was funny

1524
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:12,520
that we were pretty much hugging the first places. But still, anyways, it's like really

1525
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:19,320
fun. My only gripes with the game right now is two things. Again, it's it feels really grindy.

1526
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:26,040
But again, the fun, the fun aspect is really compensated. But the other thing is that local

1527
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:33,960
multiplayer is only for two players. So you cannot have like Mario Kart or any other racing games out

1528
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:42,360
there that you can have up to four even. So yeah, it's that's really limiting. But at the same time,

1529
02:29:42,360 --> 02:29:50,520
you can go local multiplayer via like local wireless and you can play up to up to eight.

1530
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:56,600
So if friends have this, have the game on Switch, it's like, okay, you can play like that. But

1531
02:29:57,160 --> 02:30:01,400
but I would rather like have one console and have multiple players

1532
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:05,560
have a playing from one instead of having multiple consoles.

1533
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:11,080
Let me ask you this question because, you know, it's very hard for them to once the game is out,

1534
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:15,000
kind of get people to give it a second chance. You know, it takes it takes a while for that

1535
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,880
information to get out there. We've seen it happen with games, you know, No Man's Sky,

1536
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:24,600
Diablo three, etc, etc. List goes on and on. But let's let's make believe this is the game

1537
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:30,520
they had released originally. In your opinion, do you think this ends up being a successful game?

1538
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:34,680
Or is it still just kind of like me? It's it's it's a meh game. I don't think it ever

1539
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:38,760
would have caught on anyway. What happens if this is the game they'd really released originally?

1540
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:44,680
I think at least the perspective would have been different, that's for sure.

1541
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:51,160
But I wouldn't think it would have been like a success. Like, Oh, my, you have to play this

1542
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:59,480
game. No, it would be the same. Because even even a year ago, it's like, okay, you can buy the game

1543
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:07,480
in the game. This again is it is fun. But like in comparison to other card racers, it doesn't

1544
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:13,880
bring anything new to the game. So it's like that you have your your magic sights, which is like

1545
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:21,400
your Mario Kart items, you can combine them like in DBCon racing, you have your drifting you have

1546
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:30,360
and the tracks even though they are buried there, they're not like too many, there's only like

1547
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:37,400
nine or 10 tracks in total. And each one has one or two variations of it. So it kind of gets

1548
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:47,640
repetitive in in a short term. So again, it's it wouldn't been like a huge success, probably

1549
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:52,840
a moderate success. Okay. And more people would have been like, Oh, if it's an if it's on sale,

1550
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:59,000
get it. Yeah, it's like that kind of thing. I would. Yeah, it's like, even right now it's like

1551
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:05,560
it's on sale. So that's that's how I convinced a friend to get it. Hey, it's really cheap right now.

1552
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:11,320
You should get it because we can play it and all that stuff. And yeah, he had we had a really

1553
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:17,960
good time. And we plan to play it more. So it's like, yeah, it's so awesome that that the game

1554
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:25,320
is better now. But it also sucks that it took a year. Yeah, pretty much to get there. Yeah. So

1555
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:31,320
yeah, that's a bummer. Well, depth, I appreciate the check back in with that game because I admit

1556
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:35,640
that again, the relaunch of it kind of fell off my radar. Although I was super interested in

1557
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:40,280
Chocobo GP at first I like you and many other people were just kind of like once we heard

1558
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:45,160
how they really were going to micro, you know, monetize the game and stuff. It's like, ah, fuck

1559
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:48,760
it. You know, if this if that's what this is, nevermind, we should have never had it come back

1560
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:52,920
in the first place. But it's interesting to revisit it now. I'll kind of be curious,

1561
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:56,920
especially when it does go on sale in the future inevitably. Maybe I'll end up picking it up for

1562
02:32:56,920 --> 02:33:02,920
myself. We'll see. Who knows? But again, it's it's in sale right now. Don't know how much longer it

1563
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:09,000
is going to be. But it's 50% off. So if you're really interested, you can pick it up right now.

1564
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:16,360
All right. Or relatively low price. Even the physical copies aren't that expensive. Mine was

1565
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:24,440
around $35. So again, if you're interested in that, you can get it that way. All right.

1566
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:27,000
All right. Well, depth, I'm gonna let you go. So we can wrap up the show. But thank you so much

1567
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:32,760
for the call. Hey, thanks for having me. All right. Take care, my friend. All right. That

1568
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:38,120
was great to hear from depth. Appreciate that. Well, with that, I can smell dinner downstairs.

1569
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:44,040
So I'm definitely ready to wrap on up and head on out. So reminder, we're not back next week,

1570
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:47,960
we will be back in two weeks. Bobby Black Wolf will be here next week, though. So just

1571
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:52,600
because the show ends early enough where he's able to get back and do his show.

1572
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:59,160
But I don't have my rig and can't do this show. So but so I'll be gone next week. No,

1573
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:06,440
I however, will be playing dead by daylight. All day, daylight by daylight.

1574
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:16,920
So yeah, if you want to see cranky Jamie, you have open lobbies most of the time.

1575
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:24,280
All right. Um, what's that? I said have a safe flight. Thank you. I'm flying the

1576
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:29,080
plane myself this time. So we'll see how it goes. So I'm just kidding. But hopefully,

1577
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:33,480
yeah, hopefully all goes well. We'll see you back in two weeks. We'll talk about all the greatest

1578
02:34:33,480 --> 02:34:37,880
in gaming news at that time. In the meantime, we're gonna wrap up and get on out of here for

1579
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:43,400
the night. So of course, we wouldn't be able to do this show if it wasn't for you all. Thank you

1580
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:47,000
all for checking out the show. Thank you for spending the time with us. We are the show where

1581
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,640
every gamer has a voice. But we need more voices to put out here on air. So tell a friend or two

1582
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:56,760
about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1583
02:34:56,760 --> 02:35:00,920
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, or wherever it is you found this show goes an

1584
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:06,680
awful long way as well. So super appreciate all of that as well. Final thought time stark sacral.

1585
02:35:06,680 --> 02:35:14,120
We'll start with you. I can't brain. Um, but, but pineapple and pizza is delicious,

1586
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:20,760
but pepperoni pizza is terrible. I like both personally.

1587
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:28,520
All right. Have a good stream. Have a good night. All right. Loki will go to you your

1588
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:35,480
final thought tonight. I'm going to go to Santa Cruz next week to visit the homeland

1589
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:41,240
of my DDR machine. It's allegedly it came from Santa Cruz Beach boardwalk. Allegedly,

1590
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:49,320
I don't I can't confirm that. But that's where they said they got it from. So we'll see.

1591
02:35:49,320 --> 02:35:53,400
Santa Cruz boardwalk was the first place I ever played Mortal Kombat three.

1592
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:57,400
It was also the first place I ever played laser tag. So we can go back and play that

1593
02:35:57,400 --> 02:36:00,920
laser tag to even though it looks like they set up our next week, basically.

1594
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:06,840
Yeah, basically we're going on vacation. Good. Enjoy that. That'll be fun. Awesome.

1595
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:10,200
All right. Well, uh, for my final thought, of course, I look forward to seeing those of you

1596
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:14,680
in the Atlanta area at Southern pride gaming expo. Uh, very excited about it. Uh, don't be shy,

1597
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:20,280
come up and say hi. My understanding is this is a much smaller expo than, um, dragon con. Of course,

1598
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:24,520
uh, I believe it would be more in line with the crowds I see at California extremes. So, um,

1599
02:36:24,520 --> 02:36:30,200
please, if you're there, come say hi. Don't be shy. I'm a normal person. I promise. Um, happy,

1600
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:33,880
happy to sit down and play a game. As long as it's one, I like, don't ask me to play

1601
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:37,400
literally anything. It's gotta be something I somewhat like, don't ask me to play Madden.

1602
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:42,760
I'm not going to do that, but blaze of steel. I might, I might, but I look forward to seeing

1603
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:46,120
everybody there. And of course, we're going to have that panel with the Nintendo voice actors

1604
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:51,480
Sunday at one o'clock. And I am jazzed to talk all about that on next week or next week's orange

1605
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:57,160
lounge radio. If not a little sooner, uh, that's it. Have a great week, two weeks. Everybody will

1606
02:36:57,160 --> 02:37:02,280
be back then to talk more about gaming. Have fun, stay safe, stay out of the heat. And if

1607
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:06,600
you have to be in the heat, stay hydrated, but otherwise indoors with video games,

1608
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:11,560
sounds like a great idea to me. We'll see you next time. Bye everybody. Good night.

1609
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:20,200
