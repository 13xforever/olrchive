0	13240	The Switch successor conversation has been steadily growing and it was reported that
13240	15840	Nintendo's CEO stated during a shareholders meeting that,
15840	18900	In the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next generation console, we would like
18900	22580	to make every effort to ensure the customers can make the transition smoothly while using
22580	23580	their Nintendo account.
23580	24580	What does that mean?
24580	26520	That Nintendo is making a new console!
26520	28640	And nothing else set in stone.
28640	31840	This is the news to no one headline, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie
31840	34600	Summers and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming
34600	35600	news.
35600	38360	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38360	44500	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
44500	46420	every gamer has a voice.
46420	54400	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 966 of our
54400	58600	show for tonight, July the 2nd of 2023.
58640	62080	I know it's a long weekend for some folks, but we're still here anyway.
62080	66120	I'm here, Rob Roberts, with you every week with my co-hosts.
66120	70040	Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
70040	71040	Hi.
71040	72040	Hello, hello.
72040	74600	How are you doing?
74600	81640	We live in the devil's parched dry chapped asshole.
81640	82640	We don't live in Phoenix.
82640	84480	What are you talking about?
84480	85480	No.
85480	89200	That one is the cursed parched dry asshole.
89200	90360	Oh, I see.
90360	91360	I see.
91360	93400	Thank you for the clarification.
93400	99760	Right now it's 101, so it's better than it was earlier, but we hit 108 again today.
99760	106960	Thankfully, it's going to be in the 80s, I think by the 4th, but if you live in a place
106960	112840	with vaulted ceilings, blink, blink, it does not stay cool.
113360	115880	Vaulted ceilings are not your friend.
115880	123720	I was enjoying our nice, mild June because it actually, this is the first year I can
123720	129520	think of in a long time where it has not hit 100 degrees in all of June in our lovely Sacramento,
129520	132160	California where we're all at.
132160	136040	I was like, oh, this is the site of climate change I can deal with.
136040	140880	If that means we're going to have moderate summers, okay.
140920	144720	It sucks about the floods, but you know, okay, at least we, and then nope, nope, here we
144720	151720	are right back to the, you know, Satan's taint or whatever you refer to it as is very much
151720	153960	in progress for sure.
153960	159200	Well, people were calling it like the, you know, damp asshole or like, no, no, no, that's
159200	160200	Alabama.
160200	163080	It's not damp here.
163080	165720	It's not damp.
165720	170400	And yeah, Mike, I understand it's harder where you are, but I mean, going from it having
170440	179480	been no hotter than like 85 to an immediate triple digit is a bit of a fast change and
179480	182200	I am not looking forward to my power bill.
182200	188840	I, it, you can't, it's, I cannot sleep when I'm hot and I also have this thing where I
188840	194360	have to have 50 bajillion blankets on me to be able to sleep kind of like having a weighted
194360	196680	blanket, but not quite.
196680	201800	It's been a very interesting, I'm, I'm, I, I needed help sleeping.
201800	202800	Thank you.
202800	203800	You cancel it.
203800	205120	You can't set your ingredients.
205120	206880	You can't sleep when you're hot.
206880	209400	No, but you're hot all the time.
209400	210400	Oh girl.
210400	216280	Well, I know that, but I mean, temperature wise, I actually, okay.
216280	221600	You know, you know how, how ice cream makes me really sick now.
221600	222840	I didn't care.
222840	226320	I ate an entire chocolate shake.
226320	232880	That was actually, that was me this week eating KFC because I realized the Diablo four promotion
232880	233880	ended today.
233880	236080	And I was like, Oh, I should probably go eat some KFC.
236080	241240	And then I remembered, Oh, there's a reason I don't eat KFC.
241240	242560	And that would be terrible.
242560	245720	The food is the reason I don't eat at KFC anyway.
245720	249580	I liked their fries for a long time, but you know, why could, I mean, I understand why
249580	252320	in your case, but in general, why go to KFC?
252320	254640	If you have a jolly bee near you.
254640	255760	Or even, even Popeyes.
255760	256760	I'll take Popeyes.
256760	257760	No, no, no.
257760	258760	Why?
258760	259760	Why go to Popeyes when you have a jolly?
259760	260760	Cause I don't have a jolly bean.
260760	261760	Yes, you do.
261760	262760	Rob.
262760	265080	It's all the way down near you.
265080	266080	Well now.
266080	267080	Oh no.
267080	269160	The new thing is, um, raising canes is everywhere, right?
269160	270160	Even that jolly bee.
270160	271160	All right.
271160	272160	All right.
272160	273160	It's all about the chicken.
273160	274160	Joy.
274160	275160	All right.
275160	278600	Look, I need a, I need a outside fast food opinion on this and who better to bring in
278600	280360	then tech master Loki.
280360	281360	Hello.
281360	282360	Hi.
282360	283360	Where should I get chicken?
283360	284360	Uh, bonds.
284360	285360	Oh, of course.
285960	286960	You'd say that.
286960	287960	Of course you'd say that's, that's expensive.
287960	288960	That's designed.
288960	290960	It's a Korean chicken place.
290960	292960	Oh, I mean, that's different.
292960	294280	Korean fried chicken is completely different.
294280	298560	I'm just talking about like, that's the KFC I want.
298560	301360	They have the cracked chicken, which I don't know what they put on it.
301360	304080	It's probably cracked because it's white and powdery.
304080	310200	So, you know, but it's, uh, some sort of like dust that they put on it that's sugary.
310200	313000	And I think it's like sugary or parmesani or something.
313000	314000	I don't know what it is.
314000	315000	They won't say what it is.
315640	316640	It's cracked, but like, it's good.
316640	317640	Okay.
317640	325760	Um, I have one place that will last, last message, message that mention of it in Oakland
325760	333560	on Telegraph near the, the, the original, uh, KP market, there's a place called OB town.
333560	337100	It looks like a little former fast food restaurant hole in the wall.
337100	339520	They have the best true KFC.
339520	340520	Okay.
340520	341520	End of story.
341520	345800	Well, uh, another vote for a fried chicken in our chat, uh, from DJ Rama S because we
345800	349840	do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific at the voice geeks
349840	355400	network twitch.tv slash a VOG network right after the Bobby black Wolf show, uh, except
355400	356400	not tonight.
356400	360040	Bobby black Wolf is enjoying the long holiday weekend, but Bobby will be back next week.
360040	366200	And I will be with Bobby black Wolf in Atlanta, Georgia at the end of July for the Southern
366200	370540	fried speaking of chicken, Southern fried gaming expo, which is happening at the end
370540	371540	of July.
371540	373660	Uh, so stay tuned for that.
373660	377460	Uh, but I want to get to do Jerome S who says, cause I do agree with this.
377460	383220	Do Jerome S says, uh, forget Raising Cane's hit up a local Halal fried chicken restaurant,
383220	385900	cheaper and better tasting true.
385900	388340	Some of the best fried chicken.
388340	389340	Okay.
389340	396660	However, that place in Rancho Cordova by the target, uh, is not there anymore.
396660	398700	I know I ate there.
398700	402400	And I was like, that is that, that was as good as the fried chicken at Disneyland.
402400	403400	It really was.
403400	404400	I ate those.
404400	405400	Like that was amazing.
405400	407520	Four weeks later gone.
407520	409560	And I was like, of course, because I liked it.
409560	410740	That's what happens to things I like.
410740	411900	I don't get to keep them.
411900	412900	Yeah.
412900	416060	I'd gone there before because they had chicken and waffles, but they were okay.
416060	417060	They weren't great.
417060	418060	I love them.
418060	422180	I mean, I'm even going to say that I like as much as I love Roscoe's.
422180	429740	I'm even going to say, okay, Roscoe's is kind of up at the top for me because as, as a Southern
429740	435980	girl, I know my fried chicken and I know my soul food.
435980	437840	It's it's chicken.
437840	447420	The chicken from Roscoe's with a big plate of grits is heaven followed only by fried
447420	448420	chicken liver.
448420	449420	If someone will eat it with me.
449420	450420	Okay.
450420	451420	Last thought.
451420	454580	I love Roscoe's, but since you brought up Roscoe's, it makes me laugh because did you
454580	459420	know in the gayborhood, they opened the old spot that used to be hot rods.
459420	464900	And it's now like a brunch bar called Roscoe's, but it has nothing to do, no, it has nothing
464900	465900	to do with it.
465900	466900	It's for drag brunch.
466900	467900	That's what it is.
467900	468900	So it cracked me up.
468900	473860	Cause I'm like, now when you say Roscoe's people think of that place, so can we, can
473860	474860	we go to drag brunch?
474860	475860	Of course.
475860	476860	There's like 50 of them here.
476860	477860	Yeah, of course.
477860	482860	I probably know a performer at every one of them somehow.
482860	484580	It's a small town sometimes.
484580	490180	So well, yeah, but I haven't been to drag brunch in like age, age, age, ages.
490180	491180	You want to do drag brunch?
491180	492420	You want to do drag dinner?
492420	493420	You want to do?
493420	495740	I want to do all the drags.
495740	497860	Sunday best of the week.
497860	499700	We could do a drag tee.
499700	500700	We can do that.
500700	501700	You name it.
501700	503660	Do we get, do we get to spill it?
503660	504660	Yes.
504660	505660	All right.
505660	506660	We spilled tea at the drag tee.
506660	510140	Well, we're going to spill some tea right here at the top of the show because this is
510140	515380	a company that I talk a lot about on the show and unfortunately they hit some pretty bad
515380	519900	news this week, but I think some of us might've seen this coming a little bit.
519900	524420	This is a tricky, tricky topic cause I know people and I indirectly know people that were
524420	525460	affected by this.
525460	527260	So this kind of sucks.
527260	529180	But I have some things to say about it.
529180	532480	Loki, did you want to start us off with the headline and what's going on here?
532480	533480	What I'm referring to?
533480	539400	So Niantic is shutting down their Los Angeles studio and they're moving away from in-house
539400	541960	game development.
541960	547360	The Pokemon Go studio, they're laying off 230 employees.
547360	550720	NBA All World is being shut down.
550720	551720	Oh my God.
551720	552880	It wasn't popular.
552880	554720	That's surprising.
554720	558520	And they're also canceling the upcoming Marvel World of Heroes game that they were going
558520	563240	to be putting out as well, which I mean, honestly, they have way too many games going at one
563240	564240	time.
564240	572040	They said, I guess, in internal email to the employees, they said that the expenses grew
572040	575040	faster than revenue.
575040	576560	And I mean, that makes sense.
576560	580520	We also bear the responsibility for our performance.
580520	589240	Today's highly competitive mobile gaming market requires dazzling quality and innovation.
589240	595560	It's also requires strong monetization and a social core, which can drive viral growth
595560	597120	and long term engagement.
597120	603560	Teams need to need platform tools that force multipliers, enabling them to build at the
603560	607560	highest quality with powerful engagement features quickly and efficiently.
607560	613760	Our AR map and platform must deliver the features that developers want in a robust, reliable
613760	614760	way.
614760	618720	We have not met the goals in any of these areas.
618720	623640	I just think you had poor monetization for some of that stuff.
623640	624640	I don't know.
624640	626840	You're kind of a little too greedy in some areas.
626840	628800	And yeah, lack of innovation.
628800	635520	You keep putting out games that aside from giving a new paint job, they weren't really
635520	636520	worthwhile to play.
636520	637960	It wasn't like Pokemon Go.
637960	643720	They're trying to get that success, but it just wasn't happening.
643720	647320	So I have a few things to say on this because, you know, I've been following Niantic a long
647320	648320	time, right?
649320	653840	I was in the beta for Pokemon Go because I'd played their other game, Ingress, for quite
653840	654840	a long time.
654840	658620	In fact, one of my favorite episodes we ever did of this show was back when we were all
658620	659620	in person.
659620	664360	You might remember at Studio N7, we actually brought some of the ladies that I played Ingress
664360	665360	with in for a show.
665360	667960	I want to say it was in January of one year.
667960	668960	We all were in studio.
668960	672400	That was a really fun show because they love that game.
672400	677160	The sad thing is, though, I think only one of them that was here still plays regularly.
677160	679880	The other ones have kind of, you know, gone off into retirement, but that game has been
679880	685640	around for like, you know, that game is celebrated 10 years, actually, this last year.
685640	688600	So yeah, I've been following this company for a long time.
688600	690740	So I have some thoughts on this for sure.
690740	693960	So here's the thing.
693960	697920	Why is Niantic struggling as a gaming company?
697920	702260	And I would like to share with you my thoughts on the answer to this Niantic is struggling
702260	708500	as a gaming company because Niantic is not a gaming company.
708500	714660	And in this TED Talk, I will explain to you the reasons why I believe Niantic has unfortunately
714660	720480	allowed the scope to grow too big from what they really wanted to do and allowed this
720480	723980	situation to happen in the first place.
723980	726980	Let's start.
726980	729560	I'm not joking, bitch, by the way.
729560	733400	Let's start by going to Niantic's website.
733400	735540	Let's take a look and talk.
735540	738840	Let's see what Niantic has to say about the games that they're making.
738840	742900	Of course, we have an ad for Peridot, their newest game, right?
742900	748740	And then we get down and you expect on a mobile game developer's website, you're going to
748740	754800	see something about their statement about making fun games or making accessible games
754800	758520	or making games you want to play, games as a part of our life.
758520	760200	Well, look, here it is.
760200	764300	Here's the Niantic mission statement right here at the bottom of NianticLabs.com.
764300	767680	What if augmented reality could make us better?
767680	770680	Could it nudge us off the couch for a Saturday in the park?
770680	775080	Could it draw us into public space and into contact with neighbors we might never have
775080	776260	met?
776260	777660	We believe it can.
777660	779160	Join us.
779160	784960	Now, I didn't see anything in that statement that actually related to games.
784960	790160	I saw things in that statement that related to other cool things.
790160	791160	And here's the thing.
791160	797280	I would not support Niantic as long as I have if I did not think they had some good ideas.
797280	803880	And all that stuff in there is cool stuff like, yeah, it's fun to go outside and play,
803880	806840	mix up fitness with gaming.
806840	809080	A lot of that stuff is crucial to me.
809080	815040	So I'm not necessarily razzing Niantic for that statement, but I am pointing out Niantic
815040	819600	did not start out to be a game company.
819600	825200	Continuing on, let's consider who is at the top of Niantic right now.
825200	826200	John Hankey, right?
826200	828280	Now, look, here's the thing about John Hankey.
828280	832480	I actually think he's a pretty intelligent guy and he's done a lot of stuff.
832480	837680	Disclaimer, I once met the guy and I did a Pokemon raid with him, but it was a chance
837680	840440	meeting and so forth with this whole thing.
840440	846120	But what is John Hankey's gaming background?
846120	852760	What are the games that he developed before running Niantic quickly?
852760	854520	You probably don't know.
854520	856320	That's because he made one.
856320	857320	He helped with one.
857320	860320	It was a game called Meridian 59.
860320	864080	That was for the 3DO company.
864640	868200	Yeah, but Meridian 59, well, it is still around today, actually.
868200	873080	So for all intents and purposes, I can't sit here and say, oh, Meridian 59 was a flop.
873080	879440	It was one of the first graphically multiplayer games, long, long running.
879440	884280	It may actually not be around anymore, but the game did have impact.
884280	887240	He was not the only person behind the game, but it did have impact.
887240	889080	That's not what he's known for.
889080	894760	John Hankey is known for Google Earth, Google Maps, Street View, and then some other things,
894760	898600	you know, Panoramio, which is where people are taking the panoramas within Google Maps
898600	899600	and all that stuff.
899600	901800	Now, I love Street View.
901800	903280	I love Google Maps.
903280	905760	And I think that was innovative.
905760	909480	That was like, that was big stuff, you know?
909480	911360	So again, the guy's got the resume.
911360	917480	But when it comes to gaming, it hasn't really worked on a lot, a lot of games.
917480	922360	So where did Niantic come from in the first place?
922360	926800	I mentioned that Ingress was the first game that they did, but you might forget that before
926800	930380	Ingress, they actually did an app called Field Trip.
930380	932540	Field Trip wasn't a game.
932540	937200	Field Trip was a location-based mobile app, which was your guide to cool, hidden, and
937200	939320	unique things in the world around you.
939320	948560	Ingress set out to gamify that because Ingress, as it was, or excuse me, Niantic as it was,
948560	957920	was set up not to become a gaming company, Niantic was set up to take this Google Map
957920	964560	stuff one step further and go back to their mission statement, be a part of augmented
964560	968360	reality and making the world around you better.
968400	972280	Field Trip was the first attempt to map all that stuff out.
972280	976560	Ingress then gamified it to make people want to do it more because Field Trip didn't end
976560	978320	up lasting long.
978320	980920	And then what happened after that?
980920	986160	Ingress got actually a lot bigger in Japan than it even is here, and it caught the attention
986160	988880	of some key people at Nintendo.
988880	994760	And it became, remember, Google Maps, going back to something John Hanke is familiar with,
994760	998320	when Niantic was still with Google, because remember Niantic was actually a Google company
998320	999320	at first, right?
999320	1003760	Sorry, I know you could have a whole graph going with this thing, but bear with me here.
1003760	1011920	So Niantic makes Pokemon Go as a result of the success of Ingress, the ideas that were
1011920	1017000	there, the Google Maps thing kind of leading to a tihi, wouldn't this be a cute idea?
1017000	1021040	And sure enough, they did launch this cute idea.
1021040	1026520	And then what happens after that?
1026520	1028240	Get too big for their britches.
1028240	1034640	Pokemon Go gets way bigger than anyone could have ever expected.
1034640	1042720	Even to Niantic's comments, even to anybody else out there, Pokemon Go got way bigger
1042720	1044440	than anyone anticipated.
1044440	1049440	As Mike Deft puts it in chat, remember when we reached world peace seven years ago?
1049440	1056280	Yes, summer of 2016, it's all been downhill from there in history.
1056280	1065240	The summer of Pokemon Go was the climax of human civilization.
1065240	1072920	And then it's been a slow decline from there, the pandemic and Trump and so on and so on
1072920	1075360	from there.
1075360	1078500	So Pokemon Go gets really, really big.
1078500	1080660	And then, of course, what happens from there?
1080660	1084840	Now it's, oh, my God, we've got lightning in a bottle.
1084840	1087980	We've got to replicate this lightning in a bottle.
1087980	1089900	Now we've got Pikmin.
1089900	1092100	Now we've got Harry Potter.
1092100	1101880	Now we've got Marvel, Catan, Marvel, all these games trying to replicate the success of something
1101880	1106780	that I argue can probably no longer be replicated because the world has changed.
1109300	1114220	And that's how we got into the situation that we're in today with Niantic is that they were
1114220	1121880	forced, essentially, beyond what they were setting out to do, to be a gaming company.
1121880	1127980	They were under that immense amount of pressure from everybody, investors and so forth, to
1127980	1130820	replicate the success of Pokemon Go.
1130820	1134940	But that's not what Niantic ever had set out to do.
1134940	1139540	Niantic wanted to get into this augmented reality thing.
1139540	1144460	And I mean, if you really think about it, going back to Google Maps leading to Street
1144460	1147740	View, what's one step beyond Street View?
1147740	1153360	Getting to all the places the cars can't go, looking at where people go when they walk
1153360	1157820	and mapping when they walk and the cool things they interact with when they walk, which is
1157820	1165500	literally the gameplay loop in Pikmin Bloom, which was spared from the axe, by the way,
1165500	1166500	if you noticed.
1168500	1170460	I'm sure you're really happy about that.
1170460	1174180	I am because actually, and I do, and I've been very open about this.
1174180	1179980	I credit Pikmin Bloom coming at the right time with motivating me to lose the weight.
1179980	1184340	So that's why even though, yes, I'm being a little bit critical of how we ended up in
1184340	1187300	this situation, I actually do root for Niantic.
1187780	1188780	I want them to succeed.
1188780	1190260	I want to see them be successful.
1190260	1198540	But the problem is they have literally hinged their entire lifeline on that mission statement
1198540	1202540	that I read to you earlier from their website.
1202540	1206340	One more thing I want to add to this, Loki already touched on it, but I want to bold
1206340	1208500	it and underline it.
1208500	1211040	Why did this happen?
1211040	1215660	There are internal, I'm reading from the organizational update that Loki cited earlier.
1215660	1218220	There are internal and external factors.
1218220	1223900	We're in a tough market environment due to the overall global macroeconomics slowdown.
1223900	1227020	We'll never achieve 2016 again.
1227020	1229500	Unique challenges in the mobile gaming and AR markets.
1229500	1232540	I think that's kind of fluff, but sure.
1232540	1236740	In the years since Pokémon GO's launch, the mobile market has become crowded, imitators,
1236740	1239540	knockoffs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1239540	1244020	We also face an AR market that's developing more slowly than anticipated because the technology
1244020	1248900	changes and because larger players are slowing down their investments in light of the macro
1248900	1249900	environment.
1249900	1253020	I think that's trying to say that people were going outside less during the pandemic.
1253020	1255660	I think.
1255660	1260300	We also bear responsibility for our own performance.
1260300	1264960	Today's highly competitive mobile gaming market requires dazzling quality and innovation.
1264960	1269100	It also requires strong monetization and a social core, which can drive viral growth
1269100	1271260	and long-term engagement.
1271260	1276580	Games need platform tools that are force multipliers, enabling them to build at the
1276580	1283060	highest quality with powerful engagement features quickly and efficiently.
1283060	1286700	Bold this, underline this, italicize this.
1286700	1293460	Our AR map and platform must deliver the features that developers want in a robust and reliable
1293460	1296200	way.
1296200	1301360	Isn't that interesting that that ultimately ends up being the emphasis?
1301360	1303260	Not.
1303260	1306040	We need to make better games.
1306040	1313420	The game loop is the re- you know, the, the, the, um, the monetization needs to be fun
1313420	1317940	and the game needs to be, uh, you know, things that people want to play and it's a competitive
1317940	1318940	environment.
1318940	1323520	Yes, that, that is what went wrong, but that is not what they illustrate as what they need
1323520	1325820	to do moving forward.
1325820	1329300	And to be fair, NBA world, all world got the ax.
1329300	1331080	Why did that game get the ax?
1331080	1332080	It sucked.
1332080	1333080	I'm sorry.
1333080	1337920	Like, and I, again, I know people in Antigon, I'm sorry to be a bitch, but the reality is
1337920	1343540	like, again, either, either invest in that statement that you've got or don't.
1343540	1351380	And when you walk to your neighborhood park to play a mediocre single player cell phone
1351380	1358100	basketball game for an arbitrary control of a basketball stadium that fits in with
1358100	1364860	neither a fun game or your earlier mission statement.
1364860	1367440	And there's the other extreme.
1367440	1372340	And of course it's the pink elephant in the room, Niantic disabling remote, excuse me,
1372340	1378020	not doubling remote raid passes, limiting them to five a day, consistently basically
1378020	1383160	telling the Pokemon go fans, no, we're going to do what's best for the game.
1383160	1386260	And do you know what are the most interesting comments I saw to that whole situation when
1386260	1395120	Niantic literally and continues to in a defiant Reddit CEO kind of way continues to dig their
1395120	1400160	heels in about nope, we're going back to the mission statement is that the comment I saw
1400160	1406220	was I have never seen a company so beholden to their mission statement that they are willing
1406220	1409980	to leave money on the table for it.
1409980	1414140	Well then also on top of that, like as you mentioned a them walking back all the changes,
1414140	1418680	one of the other things that they just did recently is they walked back the distance
1418680	1424980	which you can capture Pokemon from 80 meters to 40 saying that it was an unintended effect
1424980	1425980	and a bug.
1425980	1430400	You know, this this great feature that you know, could be seen as, hey, you know what,
1430400	1434200	we understand that there's people with mobility problems, and we want you to have fun.
1434200	1439040	More like, oh, I'm sorry, we can't make as much money off you because you know, we want
1439040	1440860	you to buy those incense and stuff.
1440860	1445220	So well, now we're going to just drop it back down to see if that will get you to pay us
1445220	1446920	more money for it.
1446920	1447920	Yeah.
1447920	1452320	Now, here's here's the thing and you'd probably like me to get to the fucking point already
1452320	1455560	because I've been talking about this for a while but I wanted to set the stage for this
1455560	1462200	and you know what, make make it very clear to you Niantic is torn between the AR thing
1462200	1468680	and making the games that are fun and have the whole like, gameplay loop and all of that.
1468680	1469920	Okay.
1469920	1470920	Here's the thing.
1470920	1473480	And yeah, yeah, Rob, it's easy to run a video game company.
1473480	1478160	Why don't you try running one look, we've been following this industry for 21 years,
1478160	1480280	I'm just going to offer my humble opinion.
1480280	1483800	And I'm trying not to do it in a YouTube or podcast sensationalist way.
1483800	1486200	I'm trying to do it in a realistic way.
1486200	1491320	And my suggestion would be, you need to take the cue from epic games, you need to take
1491320	1496480	the cue from some of these other Unity and Unreal.
1496480	1500480	And here's what you need to do Niantic, you need to separate.
1500480	1502660	And you need to do both.
1502660	1505600	You need one company to handle the games.
1505600	1512400	You need one company to handle lightship and AR and Wayfarer and that type of network.
1512400	1517800	You need to split just as you split off of Google to achieve your vision.
1517800	1523400	Because as you see, it is too difficult for one company and one CEO to do both.
1523400	1528160	So in my opinion, that's what Niantic needs to do is they need to split meaning there
1528160	1533500	needs to be a new CEO, a new top person in charge of the game with some game development
1533500	1537720	background and experience, who hopefully can dig them out of you know, some of these holes
1537720	1544560	and listen to because there's very clearly a conflict and you see this bolded underlined
1544560	1548600	highlighted with what's happening with the Pokemon go and the consistent rollback of
1548600	1551280	the changes.
1551280	1557460	Every change they're rolling back in Pokemon go is in support of the other half of Niantic.
1557460	1564320	And what Niantic believes is the future the AR dev lightship and taking Google street
1564320	1568360	maps one step further.
1568360	1569720	That's it.
1569720	1575440	So Niantic can either go all in on that and Pokemon go will probably last a little while
1575440	1577800	longer, but the steam is starting to run out.
1577800	1585440	I have not opened poke Well, I opened it but like I have not played Pokemon go in a while.
1585440	1590800	I think I uninstalled it a lot of people a long time ago.
1590800	1595160	So I mean, it's first of all, I also think it's very boring.
1595160	1599220	There's like, it's just repetitive over and over.
1599220	1603540	But on top of that, I mean, with the way that they've been behaving, I haven't really had
1603540	1607660	any desire to play any Niantic game.
1607660	1614900	It's just I don't want to be and the thing is, is that they don't listen to their player
1614900	1621020	base and do the things that are going to keep people engaged and keep, you know, I mean,
1621020	1623380	there are people who like Yeah, I want my shinies.
1623380	1624380	I want to do this.
1624380	1628940	I like doing this one aspect of it or there's, you know, I'm not gonna
1628940	1632540	say that there's not anything for anybody in the game.
1632540	1641020	But from my perspective, me as a player, I, there was nothing to maintain engagement.
1641020	1646280	Let's go to chat for some comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network as 100 Matt says
1646280	1647940	Niantic is not a game company.
1647940	1651220	And if someone goes to buy Niantic, they're not buying them for games.
1651220	1656100	It will be for their AR geolocation tech will someone almost bought them for their games.
1656100	1657940	I know we all saw that floating around the news.
1657940	1661540	I know we have something coming up later in the show about, you know, Microsoft's potential
1661540	1665540	acquisitions, but I don't think I'm spoiling things too much by saying Niantic in fact
1665540	1670960	was on that radar, which kind of made me giggle because when the whole Pokemon go thing happened,
1670960	1675420	I kind of joked and I said, Niantic needs to be bought out, although they're not going
1675420	1680980	to be I had no idea Microsoft was actually exploring that opportunity, but ultimately
1680980	1686920	decided to go a different direction with the Activision Blizzard decision.
1686920	1691560	Let's see, Mike Deft in chat says, but yeah, it's baffling how Niantic is willing to be
1691560	1695800	so fucking stubborn while the community wants them to change or at least adapt to the current
1695800	1704000	world because Mike Deft it's in conflict with mapping the world and getting the AR data
1704000	1709520	and getting the 3d scans of pokey stops because I'll tell you what, in Ingress, they finally
1709520	1714560	incorporated this whole thing where the scanning of the locations you can now hack cubes in
1714560	1716900	3d and this whole thing to get more gear.
1716900	1721740	It's kind of messy in the way it works, but I guarantee they're trying to do something
1721740	1726860	similar with Pokemon go and it will come in the next couple years where all those portal
1726860	1728140	scans that sort of thing.
1728140	1732100	They're going to try to get you out to those places to do, you know, an interact with the
1732100	1734300	Pokemon for whatever kind of reward.
1734300	1738160	I don't know what what they're going to dream up, but we'll see.
1738160	1744860	Every step backwards that Niantic has taken and Pokemon go, they see it as a step forward
1744860	1748520	for getting people back out there to collect the AR data.
1748520	1753540	What they are not remembering is that people are not going to be motivated to go out and
1753540	1758580	get the AR data if everybody else decided to say, screw it.
1758580	1761980	And especially on a day like today where it's one hundred and eight degrees outside, you
1761980	1762980	know what?
1762980	1763980	Screw it.
1763980	1764980	Did it?
1764980	1765980	Did it?
1765980	1766980	Let's see.
1766980	1771620	I think there was one other comment I wanted to read here.
1772380	1777460	S.H.O. 100 Matt says, and invest in a fucking PR and community management team.
1777460	1786420	Here's the sad part, Matt, who do you think lost their jobs?
1786420	1790420	But I'm going to guess those people all suck.
1790420	1799740	In fact, I don't know how much I should say I'm very confident those individuals know
1799740	1804620	damn well what everyone on the Internet is saying.
1804620	1810220	Do you think maybe, as tends to happen in the gaming industry, there was someone up
1810220	1816460	above them telling them, no, this is the message you need to run with the message?
1816460	1818460	And what's the message?
1818460	1822740	Get out there and go raid with your friends and make make friends from strangers and play
1822740	1829060	in nature, because that is our mission statement.
1829100	1834980	So it's not that they need a PR and community management team.
1834980	1835980	They had one.
1835980	1837420	They need it back.
1837420	1849220	They need management, a mission statement, a corporate culture that supports that before
1849220	1850300	anything else.
1850300	1857220	And the only way that's going to happen at this point, as I said, is Niantic to split.
1857220	1858820	Or hanky leaves and someone else comes in.
1858820	1859820	But I don't see that happening.
1859820	1864180	And again, it feels weird to me because I don't necessarily dislike John Hankey.
1864180	1865580	I think he's very intelligent.
1865580	1868060	I think he's contributed a lot to this.
1868060	1878340	I think in this particular circumstance, he is running a company he doesn't want to run.
1878340	1880020	And that's my final answer.
1880020	1882300	All right.
1882300	1883380	There's no other comments on that.
1883380	1885020	Thank you all for indulging my TED talk.
1885020	1888660	But you knew on this one, you knew on this one, I'd have something to say.
1888660	1889660	All right.
1889660	1893140	But let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things you want to say.
1893140	1895620	So let's get into our gaming weeks.
1895620	1898820	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1898820	1900500	It was all right.
1900500	1904580	I, of course, played Dead by Daylight.
1904580	1908300	I actually played some Killer by myself offline.
1908300	1916420	And I'd been playing with Fixie and Shayla offline for the anniversary stuff earlier.
1916420	1921580	And I'm liking the anniversary stuff, but matches have been weird because it's been
1921580	1928580	either completely fun farming people and assholes.
1928580	1930140	There's no in between.
1930140	1935660	The sweat has been dripping off of killers and it is rancid.
1935660	1940140	And then some smell like sweet petunias.
1940140	1949140	But of course, I'm not super happy with all the cosmetics, but I'm a whore for the cosmetics.
1949140	1954940	And then I have been, of course, on my wordscapes, talk about repetitive, but at least it's something
1954940	1957980	that stimulates my brain.
1957980	1963820	Also Midnight Suns, I'm getting a little bit, I mean, I love playing the game that's sort
1963820	1968780	of like my mindless fun, but I don't know, maybe it's time to go back to the retro games.
1968780	1971780	I haven't decided.
1971780	1983460	And of course, Cult of the Lamb, I'm thinking about going back and playing into some of
1983460	1984660	my backlog.
1984660	1993020	And I actually also did download Unity for reasons.
1993020	1998820	So we'll see what comes of that.
1998820	2003540	But mostly it's just been my usual ones.
2003540	2010180	Oh, we should be getting, I think we should be getting Reared Owl this month or next month.
2010180	2011180	Something like that.
2011180	2012180	Yeah.
2012180	2018500	And I played something else and my brain is like, you can't think of anything else that
2018500	2019860	you've ever played in your life.
2019860	2021740	So I'm just going to leave it at that.
2021740	2022740	Oh, yeah.
2022740	2023740	Dig Dug.
2023740	2024740	Fun.
2024740	2025740	Yeah.
2025740	2026740	All right.
2026740	2027740	I'm going to go to you, Loki.
2027740	2032500	But first, a lot of folks in chat have been taken by the game playing in your background
2032500	2036540	tonight, which I believe I read about this somewhere on the internet, but it's like a
2036540	2038940	newer version of ET.
2038940	2041660	So you have video that runs behind you as we're taping live on Twitch.
2041660	2044420	And this definitely looks like a sequel to ET.
2044420	2048460	Tell us a little bit about this game you've got running behind you.
2048460	2050900	I saw this in a tweet from Scott Rubin.
2050900	2053220	You know, love Scott.
2053220	2057740	It is an itch.io game called, but that's, you know, it's easy to understand.
2057740	2061340	Yeah, it's called ET Returns.
2061340	2065020	It's basically ET in the style of Vampire Survivor.
2065020	2070140	So it's a shooter game that you have to survive hordes of enemies coming.
2070140	2072660	They're all Atari 2600 enemies.
2072660	2077960	So if, you know, we've got lots of different things in there, but yeah, it's free.
2077960	2078960	You can check it out.
2078960	2081960	I'll post the link here in chat.
2081960	2085360	And yeah, it's pretty fun.
2085360	2090800	So aside from that, I played, was it Proto Corgi this week, so I actually did play some
2090800	2091800	things.
2091800	2092800	That game is awesome.
2092800	2093840	It really is.
2093840	2098160	It's like under eight dollars right now on the Steam, and it's such a really good like
2098160	2103700	classic side scrolling, shoot them up type of game.
2103700	2107200	And it has a Corgi and it barks and it's super cute.
2107200	2111040	It's done in like an anime style, like with the intro and everything.
2111040	2115720	Highly, highly recommend you go check it out, especially in the Steam store.
2115720	2117200	Yes, exactly.
2117200	2119080	And it's just it's such a good game.
2119080	2120080	It really is.
2120080	2122600	The music, everything about the game is fantastic.
2122600	2125800	And it's like under it's well under ten dollars right now.
2125800	2127960	So like absolutely go pick it up.
2127960	2130320	Aside from that, just Minecraft stuff.
2130320	2136720	So working on my build right now, I'm almost I have it all designed.
2136720	2140600	I'm actually building it and hoping to have an episode out this week.
2140600	2143960	We figured out when our next season starting.
2143960	2145240	So that's cool.
2145240	2146240	And then.
2146240	2153320	I don't know, I got very busy, thanks, like, you know, forever, but I'm very, very busy
2153320	2155120	specifically in the next two months.
2155120	2156120	So yeah.
2156120	2157120	All right.
2157120	2158120	That's it.
2158120	2159120	Oh, oh.
2159120	2160120	And I almost forgot.
2160120	2164520	I also bought a a build your own pinball kit.
2164520	2166480	And it's like a little tabletop pinball game.
2166480	2167480	Yeah, that's pretty fun.
2167480	2170440	It's all out of wood and stuff.
2170440	2175080	There's a there's a guy who sells a couple of different things like that at some of the
2175080	2179640	big expos, and I've been curious about the wooden one.
2179640	2180640	Let me know if it's fun.
2180640	2182480	Yeah, I'll have to see it.
2182480	2186760	You know, as far as assembly goes, it's all like, you know, you put push everything together.
2186760	2191360	I did kind of break one of the tiny little like pegs that you have to put into like adhere
2191360	2192360	something to it.
2192360	2195480	It's going to be like some hot glue being used, but you're supposed to be able to put
2195480	2198120	it together without having to use hot glue.
2198120	2200800	And it comes with like all the tools and everything for you.
2200800	2201800	It.
2201800	2204400	Yeah, not exactly the theme I would want.
2204400	2208000	It's like circus themed and they have like circus music that plays over it.
2208000	2210660	And so thankfully you can turn it off.
2210660	2213660	But yeah, it has all the electronics and everything for it as well.
2213660	2216960	So I'm very curious to see how it ends up playing.
2216960	2217960	Cool.
2217960	2220120	All right.
2220120	2221120	Let's see.
2221120	2224400	Let's go into a chat room over at Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network.
2224400	2228560	Tiger class says he posted that first and then Scott posted it and credited him.
2228560	2229560	Oh, sorry.
2229560	2230560	I didn't see it.
2230560	2231800	I mean, what?
2231800	2233760	I didn't see a tweet on Twitter.
2233760	2235240	I wonder why that is.
2235240	2241680	It's not because that's a big dumpster fire and even more of a dumpster fire now with
2241680	2245760	our, you know, rations of tweets per day.
2245760	2246760	Thanks.
2246760	2247760	I know.
2247760	2251200	The advertiser supported what is that guy doing?
2251200	2252240	He has no business.
2252240	2256840	But when you have all that kind of money, like, but at this point, anyone willing to
2256840	2259440	travel to Mars for that man is a fool.
2259440	2263620	But I just like, I just like, well, like, yeah, yeah, like it's weird.
2263620	2269440	Like the age that we're in right now, it honestly feels like the Internet is falling apart to
2269440	2270440	a certain extent.
2270440	2274920	Like, first you have the nonsense going on with Reddit, which sucks because I did use
2274920	2276920	a third party app to view Reddit.
2276920	2278960	And I've tried using their app to view it.
2278960	2279960	It's awful.
2279960	2280960	It's really bad.
2280960	2281960	It's really.
2281960	2285000	So, OK, I'll make this really quick.
2285000	2290840	So Reddit basically is trying to do an IPO to do a dissertation like the one I provided
2290840	2291840	earlier.
2291840	2294440	But so we're going to try to try to make it very quick.
2294440	2299660	They're trying to do an IPO so that they can make more money.
2299660	2305840	And I guess so that's spaz the owner of Reddit or CEO or whatever can get out of the company.
2305840	2313720	So they're trying to make it, you know, valuable for their shareholders, potential shareholders
2313720	2315060	to invest in the company.
2315060	2320580	So as that they wanted to stop third party apps because there's a potential that they
2320580	2325020	could block ads and some of them may have blocked some of the ads or posts or whatever
2325020	2326020	that they had.
2326020	2331800	But that's not only what they did, though, they also provided like, you know, accessibility
2331800	2332800	stuff.
2332800	2334500	They made it a lot easier to view things.
2334500	2339420	They were a lot more performant than Reddit stuff is because Reddit auto plays their official
2339420	2344220	app, auto plays every single video that's on the page as you scroll by and it uses a
2344220	2348700	ton more bandwidth than the other apps, which is annoying.
2348700	2349860	So they did all that stuff.
2349860	2355380	So the way they got they shut down the third party apps, as they said, instead of it being
2355380	2361740	free to access stuff through the API, we're going to charge you X number of dollars per,
2361740	2364820	you know, number of views per user or whatever.
2364820	2369220	So it ended up being like, for example, I think Reddit is fun or Apollo one of those,
2369220	2375340	I can't remember that they said it would cost them like $20 million a year to run that through
2375340	2377980	Reddit, whereas they're not making that kind of money.
2377980	2384980	So essentially, he each really made it really expensive for them to run these third party
2384980	2385980	apps.
2385980	2387700	So essentially shutting them down.
2387700	2391400	Along with that, though, there's been protests, you had people blacking out like different
2391400	2393280	subreddits in protest.
2393280	2396000	So what he did is he took those mods and kicked them out.
2396000	2397800	And he's now opening them back up.
2397800	2399960	He's basically forcing this stuff open.
2399960	2403880	But then there's other reds are protesting by like posting pictures of john Oliver, which
2403880	2404880	is funny.
2404880	2405880	I love that.
2405880	2407760	So, you know, so they have that stuff.
2407760	2409440	But it's just it's a big old mess.
2409440	2414940	There's companies leaving like the Minecraft devs stop putting stuff on there now.
2414940	2418640	So they've said bye, we're not doing we're not posting on Reddit anymore.
2418640	2423680	So you have that they have GIF cat, which is another site that was used a lot with Reddit
2423680	2426760	to post all the wonderful GIFs on there.
2426760	2428300	They're shutting down September.
2428300	2432000	So all of the stuff that's on there, all of that's gonna be gone all these broken links.
2432000	2433000	Awesome.
2433000	2434720	And then you have Twitter doing Twitter things.
2434720	2439800	So it's like, all these different platforms and social media and stuff are just like kinda
2439800	2442840	say, Okay, well, where are we going next?
2442840	2446600	Because like, same thing happened way back in the day with like digging stuff like everyone
2447560	2449360	I was gonna say, I don't think the internet's dying.
2449360	2450480	I think it's evolving.
2450480	2455080	You know, and I understand that there's a bunch of websites used to be part of our daily
2455080	2456920	and you just named one dig.
2456920	2459440	Live Journal, of course, is what we've been talking about lately.
2459440	2463440	You know, I met my husband on Live Journal, fuck, probably all of our relationships and
2463440	2468240	OLR like was enhanced because of Live Journal and the deep, you know, relationships that
2468240	2471160	you could really build on that website, but obviously, it's long gone.
2471160	2476560	I mean, it's, it's there in name, but only in named, let's be real at this point.
2476560	2480320	It, it really actually still functions exactly the same.
2480320	2481320	It does.
2481320	2485720	But, you know, number one, the fact that it's, you know, Russian owned in this, you know,
2485720	2491520	global, you know, world, yes, it is an issue, fundamentally, it's the same app, people don't
2491520	2493280	know what's going on behind it.
2493280	2494280	Yeah.
2494280	2499200	And a lot of, you know, people's tastes, you know, evolved to what was going on with, you
2499200	2504040	know, Twitter, Live Journal, but then of course, where did face or excuse me, Twitter, my Facebook,
2504040	2507600	but where did my space, you know, lead to Facebook and that type of stuff.
2507600	2512560	And of course, my space then went under, you know, and, and there's, there's lots of websites
2512560	2514560	that, you know, they come and go.
2514560	2518520	And honestly, Twitter's, if you want to see what's going to happen to Twitter, look at
2518520	2521940	Live Journal, functionally, it will still be the same.
2521940	2524560	But by that point, everybody will have left.
2524560	2530760	So except for maybe one random country that decides to embrace it, like it's, or the new
2530760	2533640	owners decide to invest in that, you know, or whatever.
2533640	2534640	So it's sure.
2534640	2535640	Yeah, I know.
2535640	2536640	It's not like the end of the world.
2536640	2537640	It's just the inner.
2537640	2538640	It's like some of the parts of the internet.
2538640	2541960	It's just it makes it less convenient for things, I guess.
2541960	2546480	It's not like, you know, it was, I don't remember too much with dig because that was a while
2546480	2547480	ago.
2547480	2551560	But it was pretty obvious like, okay, while going here, like, now it's like, what if I
2551560	2552560	have a FARC?
2552560	2554160	That was the website with the Photoshop contest.
2554160	2557040	That was the one I don't think I've ever heard of that.
2557040	2558040	Really?
2558040	2560680	I think it was around the same time as dig.
2560680	2564840	But yeah, I'm sure it'll all be fine like, you know, things will fall in place wherever
2564840	2565840	they are.
2565840	2566840	But like, I don't know.
2566840	2571640	It's just, it's interesting that it's like all happening at one time like it's, I don't
2571640	2572640	know.
2572640	2573640	All right.
2573640	2574640	Thank you.
2574640	2578040	Thank gosh, someone else remembers that fifth dream in chat says I used to go there all
2578040	2579040	day.
2579040	2580040	All right.
2580040	2581040	Anyway, moving on my gaming week.
2581040	2582040	Sorry about my gaming week.
2582040	2584040	Obviously, I don't have a ton to talk about because I've still been playing Final Fantasy
2584040	2585920	16 all week.
2585920	2589840	And yeah, pretty much everything I said last week hasn't really changed.
2589840	2590840	Love the story.
2590840	2591840	Love where it's going.
2591840	2597080	Very interesting side quests, surprising amount of depth in the side quest.
2597080	2601860	I was really there's a couple that really I was like, wow, this is this is some deep
2601860	2603880	stuff in these side quests.
2603880	2605240	So I was really impressed with that.
2605240	2611000	But the only you know, again, kind of going back to you know, is it a perfect game new?
2611000	2614960	There's some things where it's showing its weakness.
2614960	2616840	I'm not sure it's a 10 out of 10 game.
2616840	2620400	It's probably a nine out of 10 but but some things holding it back.
2620400	2625420	Like, honestly, the shop and the crafting system feel like they're only there because
2625420	2627320	they have to be.
2627320	2633140	There's no real sense of choice in either of those systems or freedom or interesting
2633140	2635720	things going on with that.
2635720	2639280	So you know, that's that's my biggest thing where I'm like, why is this even here?
2639280	2642240	This feels tacked on because like somebody would complain it's not a Final Fantasy game
2642240	2646640	if it doesn't have shops and Gil and all that but like literally I'm hounding Gil with nothing
2646640	2650200	to spend it on, which I find very interesting.
2650200	2654140	But at the end of the day, it's more about the story, the gameplay, the experience and
2654140	2656440	all of that has been really stellar.
2656440	2658480	So that's my thought on that.
2658480	2660680	But that isn't the only thing I've been playing this week.
2660680	2665780	I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, honestly, because I've been trying
2665780	2669320	to stream and or record all of my 16 gameplay.
2669320	2673920	I have it all archived on my YouTube channel at this point, either my streams from Twitch,
2673920	2678920	or side quest stuff that I just recorded, I didn't stream, it's all on my YouTube channel.
2678920	2681320	But you know, sometimes I want to play something else.
2681320	2684200	So I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight.
2684200	2689380	But also, randomly, because it was on sale on the PlayStation Store, I forgot that this
2689380	2692040	game had come out and I actually kind of wanted it.
2692040	2697980	I bought today the Atari 50 collection, the 50th anniversary Atari that actually has a
2697980	2703320	pretty good lineup of like 2600 games, arcade games, and yes, even Jaguar games.
2703320	2710280	So you know, the first game I played several for a little bit was Tempest 2000.
2710280	2712240	And I got my super zapper recharge.
2712240	2716720	And I remembered how awesome that game was, because that game is fucking fabulous.
2716720	2720560	So that was, yeah, that was a good good time.
2720560	2722100	You know what I should do?
2722100	2728760	I should send you like all of the the rips I made off of the Sega Saturn disk.
2728760	2731240	Actually that might be it was all it was all Redbook.
2731240	2736960	That might make for some fun, like raid and bit donation, you know, Twitch ambient noises.
2736960	2741160	I bet super zapper recharge would be a fun one for something maybe a new follow or something.
2741160	2745000	So I yeah, I it's great.
2745000	2747560	Darja says the museum stuff is so in depth.
2747560	2748560	It's wild.
2748560	2750240	Yeah, I started to browse it a little bit.
2750240	2756280	It is kind of like, it's like fucking Microsoft and Carta, but all about the Atari and on
2756280	2757280	the PlayStation.
2757280	2760320	It's like all of these things to read about.
2760320	2762800	And I was reading, you know, obviously, it starts at the very beginning.
2762800	2765160	So there was some stuff on computer space.
2765160	2769200	And there's an interview in there where the guy, one of the target guys talks about that
2769200	2775600	he tracked down just a few years ago, like 15 years ago, the very first computer space
2775600	2782120	machine that was ever made, he was actually able to find it, you know, where he found
2782120	2788400	it, Dixon, California, in a warehouse, really, it was it was sitting there and he talks about
2788400	2793240	like, the yellow, like, because the guy apparently was selling them for like $5,000 each, and
2793240	2794400	there were all these different colors.
2794400	2796320	He's like, Where did he get these?
2796320	2799980	And then he took a friend that I mean, it's all under the collection.
2799980	2806300	And it goes, he goes, I realized this was like the Atari co founders actual collection.
2806300	2807880	And this was computer space.
2807880	2811040	The yellow one was the very first computer space machine.
2811040	2813120	So he bought it and he has it for himself now.
2813120	2817840	But I that cracked me up because he's sitting there going, Yeah, we found it in Dixon, California,
2817840	2821520	which is a little, you know, pullaway town between San Francisco and Sacramento.
2821520	2823480	I'm like, I know exactly where Dixon is.
2823480	2824880	I've been there way too many times.
2824880	2825880	Unfortunately,
2825880	2826880	that's also where Pinagogo is.
2826880	2827880	The pinball thing is.
2827880	2828880	Yeah, I still do Pinagogo.
2828880	2829880	Yeah.
2829880	2831360	And I can't go because it's corn season.
2831360	2832360	Yeah.
2832360	2833360	So.
2833360	2840240	But yeah, so it's interviews like that, you know, that, that make it very interesting.
2840240	2842560	So they put it together like an interactive documentary.
2842560	2843560	It's pretty cool.
2843560	2844560	And of course, the games in there.
2844560	2847960	I also played a little bit of the yards revenge reimagined.
2847960	2852000	The only thing I don't like that's happening is that Atari is like going in like all these
2852000	2853320	different directions.
2853320	2859880	So they released like a yards revenge reimagined on steam recently.
2859880	2867680	This is not that this is like literally the, you know, 4k cartridge from the 2600 but completely
2867680	2872800	redone with like, like new graphics but in the style of old graphics.
2872800	2874080	It's hard to explain.
2874120	2877960	It looks really cool though like and I enjoy playing it because yards yards revenge to
2877960	2880720	this day has solid fucking gameplay.
2880720	2882000	It's a good game.
2882000	2884260	So it was fun to go back and play it.
2884260	2887160	So yeah, I think there's a lot of games in the collection.
2887160	2890520	I think it's I think it's well done, you know, especially for whatever it cost me being on
2890520	2894600	PlayStation Plus $27 or something like that was a really good deal and I bet this game
2894600	2898440	will come down to $19.99 I'm sure at some point, I think that would be the sweet spot
2898440	2899440	for a lot of people.
2899440	2903320	So yeah, I think Atari 50 is worth checking out.
2903320	2906000	If nothing else, go play those Jaguar games.
2906000	2908360	None of them are very good except tempest 2000.
2908360	2910520	But it's a it's a good trip down memory lane.
2910520	2913760	And honestly, tempest 2000 is worth the price alone.
2913760	2917880	Like it's tempest 2000 plus a lot of other cool games.
2917880	2920480	So I'm doing something for you right now, Rob.
2920480	2923600	Oh, just for the sake of our listeners.
2923600	2924600	Okay.
2924600	2926000	So give me a second.
2926000	2927000	All right.
2927000	2929000	I'm making sure that you get this.
2929000	2930000	Okay.
2930480	2934720	Because this is why everyone in the universe needs the soundtrack.
2934720	2937520	All right, and I did it through discord.
2937520	2938520	So you're welcome.
2938520	2945280	Oh, um, I can't hold on because this is just I can't exactly bring up the discord easy.
2945280	2946760	I thought that you were in.
2946760	2947760	Nevermind.
2947760	2948760	Don't worry about it.
2948760	2954560	I actually have the the first big track apart from the intro for tempest 2000 in my collection.
2954560	2957480	Okay, wait, hold on, because what I can do.
2958480	2964080	Let me quickly do I didn't mean to completely derail things, but I figured people need to
2964080	2968080	know Oh, girl, when don't you derail things on this program?
2968080	2969080	Hey.
2969080	2970080	Okay.
2970080	2971080	Okay.
2971080	2974880	So what we can do is we could have found you a Oh, there we go.
2974880	2978520	Um, except Oh, shit, now I do this as classic game.
2978520	2979880	Now I can't access discord.
2979880	2981960	I have to do that real quick and drag it over here.
2981960	2982960	Okay.
2982960	2983960	I'm sorry.
2983960	2984960	Okay.
2984960	2985960	Okay.
2985960	2986960	Okay.
2987440	2988440	Yeah.
2988440	2989440	Oh, yeah.
2989440	2991600	Oh, this is really good quality.
2991600	2992600	This is better quality.
2992600	2996800	I think that's in the that's in the actual try 50 collection.
2996800	3000000	So I know you guys can't hear it through discord but listeners can hear.
3000000	3008040	This is the actual like 90s techno mortal combat.
3008040	3015480	But this is this was 1996 97 around then maybe earlier than that, but I mean, this is what
3015480	3019120	I was listening to in college when I wasn't listening to Radiohead.
3019120	3022220	If I listen to this in the car, I'm going to pause this now and go back.
3022220	3026240	If I listen to this car, I in the car, I would drive very fast.
3026240	3029380	I would drive very, very fast if I had to listen to this for sure.
3029380	3031000	So yeah.
3031000	3040400	These were the ones that were ripped off the Saturn disk.
3040400	3043360	Because the Saturn disk was all red book.
3043360	3044360	Yeah.
3044360	3045360	Yeah.
3045360	3046360	All right.
3046360	3047360	Tempest 2000.
3047360	3048360	Fun game.
3048360	3049360	All right.
3049360	3050920	With that, let's get into some news.
3050920	3053040	We have some headlines to tackle tonight.
3053040	3059720	And of course, the ongoing courtroom saga that we've been talking about for months and
3059720	3064560	months and years as the acquisition turns as the acquisition turns.
3064560	3066480	What's the latest Loki?
3066480	3077360	So Sony or Microsoft says it's Tony's fault that we have console exclusives because, yes,
3077360	3083400	it says if it was up to me, I would love to get rid of entire exclusive or entire exclusives
3083400	3084680	on consoles.
3084680	3090640	But that's not for me to define as a low share player in the console market, Nadella said.
3090640	3095740	The dominant player there, Sony, has defined the market competition using exclusives.
3095740	3097440	So that's the world we live in.
3097440	3101140	And I have no love for that world.
3101140	3102140	I don't believe that.
3102140	3104420	Wasn't Nintendo doing it first anyway?
3104420	3105420	I don't know.
3105420	3107540	But I also don't believe that.
3107540	3108540	So you know.
3108540	3109540	Yeah.
3109540	3116840	I'm like the idea of exclusive goes back to honestly, the Atari and the Intellivision
3116840	3119520	and all the systems that were out at that time.
3119520	3122220	All these companies are making the combat was an Atari exclusive.
3122220	3123220	They both do it.
3123220	3124220	Yeah.
3124220	3125220	They both do it.
3125220	3128180	It's not just like because I think what was it?
3128180	3133420	Tomb Raider was an exclusive on Xbox for a year as well.
3133420	3134420	Second one was.
3134420	3135420	Yeah.
3135420	3136420	Yeah.
3136420	3137420	Maybe the third one.
3137420	3138420	One of them.
3138420	3139420	One of them was.
3139420	3140420	Yeah.
3140420	3141420	Yeah.
3141420	3145180	So it's like it's not just like a Sony thing.
3145180	3149540	I don't know, like it's so dirty, like I just want this to be over with already.
3149540	3152060	Like I'm so sick of it.
3152060	3158020	It's just it's pathetic to hear these companies going, well, it's just not fair that you do
3158020	3159020	it that way.
3159020	3161900	And then I do this and it's just not fair.
3161900	3166500	The world is not fair for us multi-billion dollar companies.
3166500	3172340	I think another way to put it is incredibly transparent how the lawyers are twisting shit
3172340	3173460	to get what they want.
3173460	3174460	Of course.
3174460	3175460	Of course.
3175460	3176460	That's what it is.
3176460	3177460	Yeah.
3177460	3178460	They're going to make the argument.
3178460	3179460	And I hope.
3179460	3181460	Which is what our legal system is founded on.
3181460	3182460	Yeah.
3182460	3183460	Yeah.
3183460	3184460	I hope.
3184460	3185460	Who can argue that?
3185460	3186460	However, you know, FTC.
3186460	3192220	You know, I hope that our government is smart enough to see through that, but.
3192220	3193220	Are they?
3193220	3194220	Are they?
3194220	3195220	Will they, though?
3195220	3198780	They're like, well, they said that Sony does it, so I guess I have to believe that face
3198780	3199780	value.
3199780	3200780	Sure.
3200780	3201780	I'll take the word for it.
3201780	3202780	I trust everybody.
3202780	3203780	100 percent.
3203780	3204780	I'm sorry.
3204780	3207220	I'm I'm I'm laughing.
3207220	3210820	There's something else, too, that I referred I'd referred to earlier, like because Niantic
3210820	3211820	was a part of this.
3211820	3212820	Right.
3212820	3213820	Yeah.
3213820	3217640	So then there's also some emails that came out talking about different acquisition plans.
3217640	3222240	So Microsoft, of course, in the buying mood of different companies, they had looked at
3222240	3227780	purchasing other companies outside of Activision Blizzard before settling on them.
3227780	3235540	So for example, some of those included Sega requiring Bungee Niantic, IO Interactive and
3235540	3242660	Zynga to help bolster its Gains Pass service.
3242660	3248660	They said that we believe that Sega has a well built or built a well-balanced portfolio
3248660	3253940	of games across global segments and global geographic appeal, and that will help accelerate
3253940	3256100	Game Pass both on and off console.
3256100	3258520	All I'm saying is it's still not too late.
3258520	3261140	You know, you could still purchase Sega as well.
3261140	3264860	I mean, I don't know if this all falls through.
3264860	3268100	And like, they're just going to go, OK, fine.
3268100	3272340	You know, it's kind of like going on that like.
3272340	3277940	Like retail therapy after a bad breakup or something like that, it's like, well, you
3277940	3281740	know, I got to make up for retail therapy, but I guess I guess I'm just going to have
3281740	3288540	to purchase some more companies then, you know, I mean, all those all those Microsoft
3288540	3291020	buying Sega rumors came from somewhere.
3291020	3294020	Microsoft may not have bought Sega, but they definitely deepened that relationship.
3294020	3296380	I mean, hello, Phantasy Star Online, too.
3296380	3300340	Like the whole reason we have that is because Microsoft kind of stepped in to make that
3300340	3301340	happen.
3301340	3302340	Right.
3302340	3303560	So, you know, there's that.
3303560	3307820	So yeah.
3307820	3312500	It's interesting to see that some things did come of that whole situation.
3312500	3313500	Right.
3313500	3317540	So, yeah, I'm surprised they found value in Zynga, but I mean, you know, it's cool.
3317540	3318540	Yeah.
3318540	3319540	Somebody did.
3319540	3320640	All right.
3320640	3325000	Let's move on and talk about Blizzcon.
3325000	3326000	Blizzcon's coming back.
3326000	3328040	You know, we haven't had Blizzcon in a few years.
3328040	3333920	You know, the pandemic happened and, you know, a lot has been happening with Activision Blizzard.
3333920	3335960	I don't need to go back and talk about it.
3335960	3340960	But obviously, they have not been in the public's favor as a result.
3340960	3345360	But things are, you know, as we start to learn that that exists everywhere in the gaming
3345360	3349000	industry and we sort of accept that, you know, at some point, Activision is going to get
3349000	3353980	bought by somebody and Bobby Kotick is no longer going to be in charge, let's hope for
3353980	3354980	God's sake.
3354980	3355980	Someday.
3355980	3356980	Hopefully.
3356980	3360720	And that Blizzard has kind of had some wins on their hands lately, like Dragonfly, pretty
3360720	3364200	good WoW expansion, better than the other recent ones.
3364200	3367480	Diablo 4, really fucking good the way it turned out.
3367480	3370960	So Blizzard has been kind of winning stuff lately and it's been winning back some of
3370960	3373000	their fans as a result.
3373000	3381000	So Blizzcon is going to happen and it will be priced at $300.
3381000	3385600	If you would like to go to Blizzcon, you'll get access to all halls, the Blizzcon store
3385600	3390080	on Thursday, you know, spending money to spend more money, Blizzcon in-game goodies and a
3390080	3391080	Blizzcon backpack.
3391080	3392080	Ooh.
3392080	3395400	Well, you know what, if standing in line doesn't sound like fun to you, then you can get the
3395400	3398480	Portal Pass, $800.
3398480	3404080	Games you also access to an exclusive lounge, a separate registration line, a separate security
3404080	3408040	line, and even early convention entry so you can go run and line up for whatever games
3408040	3412040	you want to play because they're showing it, which I would imagine, I don't know what they're
3412040	3413040	going to show.
3413040	3417200	I feel like it'd be too early to unveil a Diablo expansion.
3417200	3419040	Overwatch is in a weird place.
3419040	3423560	Maybe the next WoW expansion, maybe something's brewing in the StarCraft universe.
3423560	3425360	We haven't heard from that for a long time.
3425360	3426360	That's true.
3426360	3430280	It could be time to talk about StarCraft 3 or something in that universe.
3430280	3432440	I don't know.
3432440	3438120	But clearly Blizzard has something they want to show because I swear to God, if they charge
3438120	3445400	people $300 just to do that year where don't you all have cell phones, it's over for Blizzcon
3445400	3446840	to be quite honest.
3446840	3448060	Is it though?
3448060	3450060	Is it over?
3450060	3454560	You know what, that's a fair point because most people go to Blizzcon to hang out with
3454560	3458840	their WoW friends, or Overwatch Diablo friends, but mostly WoW.
3458840	3461440	Some people just go to Discon.
3461440	3463360	Which is, is that just Disneyland afterwards?
3463360	3465520	That's when you go to Disneyland after Blizzcon.
3465520	3470280	Or the hotel pre-, I went one year, yeah, because Alan and I went to Disneyland, and
3470280	3474120	then we went to the pre-parties for Blizzcon and the post-parties, but we just went to
3474120	3480600	Disneyland during the actual con, so there was that.
3480600	3482640	Let's see.
3482640	3489200	There also will be a virtual ticket, and it's gonna be free.
3489200	3490200	Which is interesting.
3490200	3494200	A virtual ticket is still an optional purchase, I think that gets you the stuff in-game if
3494200	3495840	you do that.
3495840	3498720	So that's kind of interesting, but you can watch the livestreams for free because it
3498720	3501000	would be silly if you couldn't watch the livestreams.
3501000	3504320	I have heard that there's some weird stuff going on though, where like they're not even
3504320	3507280	doing the announcements in Hall D this year.
3507280	3513400	They're doing it in the arena, which means the arena can only hold so many people, and
3513400	3516080	the rest of the convention center's gonna be for overflow.
3516080	3520960	So even if you buy a $300 ticket, you may not get to go to the opening ceremonies live.
3520960	3526440	There's just some weird shit going on with this year's Blizzcon, and I don't know.
3526440	3531240	But people will have to make up their mind, because tickets go on sale July 8th at 10
3531240	3535080	AM, the first wave, and the second wave July 22nd at 10 AM.
3535080	3539960	Blizzcon, by the way, is in Anaheim from November 3rd through the 4th.
3539960	3544760	I mean, I don't know.
3544760	3546240	What's going on over here?
3546240	3550560	Sorry, suddenly a full screen ad started playing.
3550560	3551560	Sorry about that.
3551560	3554640	Oh, the Tempest video was still running, and then it ran an ad in the middle of it.
3554640	3556720	My bad.
3556720	3563360	But anyway, yeah, I'm curious to see what they're gonna announce to justify that cost.
3563360	3565400	Maybe a new IP or something up their sleeve.
3565400	3568320	Oh, Hearthstone has been quiet for a little while.
3568320	3569320	That's a good point, Fifth Dream.
3569320	3571920	I don't know if we've seen anything out of Hearthstone for a while.
3571920	3573920	We'll see.
3573920	3574920	All right.
3574920	3576480	I think Dark Soccer, I heard you back, yeah?
3576480	3577720	Yeah, I'm back.
3577720	3578720	Okay.
3578720	3580400	Your camera stopped for whatever reason.
3580400	3581400	But what is on?
3581400	3583360	Oh, because I didn't turn it back on.
3583360	3584360	There you go.
3584360	3585360	All right.
3585360	3587360	What's next for you?
3587360	3594560	So a game that I love, that I actually kind of miss playing with certain people, Among
3594560	3595600	Us.
3595600	3598080	We love Among Us, don't we?
3598080	3601920	Well, it's getting an animated series.
3601920	3608960	They are working with, actually, hold on, let me just go ahead and, yeah, IndieSloth
3608960	3620240	is working with CBSi animation to make this a reality.
3620240	3623280	It definitely, I think, is about time.
3623280	3630040	I mean, because it was, it's one of those games that came up and rose really sharply
3630040	3636720	and then it had this really quick decline and then came back up.
3636720	3644600	And so I'm hoping it has the same sort of weird humor that the game keeps as well.
3644600	3650880	I want something a little bit more adult and subversive than just for kids.
3650880	3655480	But I think this is going to be a lot of fun.
3655480	3657480	I'm looking forward to it.
3657480	3664280	So just as long as there's spikes going through people's heads and random gunshots and people
3664280	3666920	being set on fire, I'm happy with that.
3666920	3669280	Sounds like a lovely kid's show.
3669280	3675080	I wonder if even there might be like a spy versus spy element to it.
3675080	3676080	I think.
3676080	3677080	Oh, I could see that.
3677080	3678080	I could see that.
3678080	3679080	Yeah.
3679080	3682520	As Stuart Hunter Matt says, so glad Owen Dennis working on this, he did a great job on Infinity
3682520	3683520	Train.
3683520	3684520	Yeah.
3684520	3687120	Yeah, it'd be cute.
3687120	3688120	So we'll see.
3688120	3689120	We'll see what comes of that.
3689120	3693600	I wouldn't mind if it was kind of like a dark humor type of thing, you know, where it can
3693600	3697840	still be like kid appropriate, but it's a little bit morbid, like like the Addams Family.
3697840	3700680	It's kind of like that, you know.
3700680	3702720	I would I would argue that.
3702720	3704720	Well, I don't know.
3704720	3707760	Yeah, I see it.
3707760	3710680	Maybe I'm just thinking the Addams Family today, because today I was randomly thinking
3710680	3715560	of Debbie Jelinski from Addams Family values and how Joan Cusack is the is the the most
3715560	3719600	perfect supporting actress ever in a motion picture in that role.
3719600	3724120	Debbie Jelinski is the best supporting actress ever in a motion picture, period.
3724120	3729520	Did you did you see like my posts on and well, I know that you're not doing the Twitter thing
3729520	3734280	so much anymore, but I actually wanted to I'd get cut off.
3734280	3738600	Don't I deserve love and jewelry?
3738600	3741480	Did you ever watch Wednesday?
3741480	3742520	I need to.
3742520	3746800	I saw a couple episodes in the background at a friend's house, but I have it and it
3746800	3749440	was the dance episode to the one that Yeah.
3749440	3750760	But I haven't watched it start to finish.
3750760	3751760	I need to.
3751760	3752760	But it was pretty good.
3752760	3753760	I liked it.
3753760	3754760	You look cute.
3754760	3757520	It was it was like kind of I don't know.
3757520	3759520	It was it was pretty good.
3759520	3760660	I don't know.
3760660	3766400	It felt like a Harry Potter TV series, but not without the without the transphobia.
3766400	3769400	Yeah, it's great.
3769400	3771840	Yes, exactly.
3771840	3777920	As we were saying, I was going to say and then I also said, so I have to use persuasion
3777920	3784800	and slides as my two favorite lines, as Joe and Matt says, Infinity Train had a ton of
3784800	3787280	dark humor, a very deep mystery that was kid appropriate.
3787280	3788280	OK, sounds interesting.
3788280	3789280	Could be interesting.
3789280	3790280	All right.
3790280	3794640	I want something like Rocky and Bullwinkle way where kids can watch it and laugh.
3794640	3798280	And then when you go back as an adult who actually knows the history of the era.
3798280	3801040	Oh, oh, oh, I see.
3801040	3803520	Tiny toons and Animaniacs were very Animaniacs.
3803520	3804520	Yeah.
3804520	3805520	Yeah.
3805520	3806520	And Freakazoid.
3806520	3808620	That's a great humor, for sure.
3808620	3811660	That takes talent in writing to get that to go off.
3811660	3816120	And such such a missed opportunity Warner Brothers for not making a live action Freakazoid
3816120	3820400	movie with Jim Carrey like probably 20 years ago.
3820400	3821400	Amazing.
3821400	3823400	All right.
3823400	3828920	Well, speaking of things that have had to pivot pretty quick, Loki.
3828920	3829920	Yes.
3829920	3839720	So Daedalic put out a game, maybe, maybe you can classify it as a game, Lord of the Rings
3839720	3841060	Golem.
3841060	3842240	It was awful.
3842240	3845600	It was absolutely all around awful.
3845600	3848360	And originally the studio was poised to make.
3848360	3850640	Golem as a character is not good, too.
3850640	3851760	I'm going to go.
3851760	3853000	Let's start there.
3853000	3855000	Let's start that like the most annoying part of those movies.
3855000	3858440	Golem is a means to an end in the books and in general.
3858440	3862680	The most annoying things in that movie who said let's put them in a starring role in
3862680	3863680	the game.
3863680	3864680	First mistake.
3864680	3872280	Yeah, it was bad corrupted hobbit who kills people as you're, you know, well, on top of
3872280	3878240	that game out of Liv Tyler, she's pretty it the game itself was really awful in the sense
3878240	3882960	that even with the Golem character, it was just you're in jail for a while and you're
3882960	3885840	doing jail things and it's stupid.
3885840	3891920	And that's beyond like if you don't even look at the technical parts of the game, which
3891920	3895720	it was just awful all around awful gameplay, awful everything.
3895720	3902280	The game lagged out people's PCs while displaying the credits at the end of the game.
3902280	3903400	That's how bad it is.
3903400	3904400	It's so bad.
3904400	3910160	OK, anyways, so the studio, of course, apologized for the state that Golem was in.
3910160	3914600	Then, of course, they kind of put out this statement saying even though Lord of the Rings
3914600	3918280	Golem did not live up to expectations we had for the game.
3918280	3921360	Yeah, like by a mile.
3921360	3929480	We are very grateful for this opportunity and learning experience it brought us.
3929480	3936040	It's a difficult break, but also a new beginning in the long history of Daedalic entertainment.
3936040	3938160	We value each and every one of them.
3938160	3944800	Anyways, basically somebody I'm assuming the Embracer group said, Hey, you're making more
3944800	3948400	games for this because like originally they were going to make like, I think, eight different
3948400	3949720	Lord of the Rings games.
3949720	3955040	Yeah, you're touching any more of this property.
3955040	3962200	So because of they also said that they twenty five of it, like at this point, they're not
3962200	3964440	even going to be allowed to adapt the book.
3964440	3966000	Everybody poops like that.
3966000	3968440	That's just this game company is done.
3968440	3971400	The only thing that pooped was the game.
3971400	3972840	It was just it was.
3972840	3973840	No, the game.
3973840	3978840	The game was the gas we pass the less talked about sequel.
3978840	3982120	They were written by different authors, so just part of a series.
3982120	3985880	And I think I have most of them.
3985880	3991420	I actually do have the gas we pass and everyone poops and a couple of the others.
3991420	3996820	And I still consider Go the Fuck to Sleep a part of that that trilogy, even though it
3996820	4001900	isn't actually related, it is my head canon.
4001900	4004780	I think there's like six books in the series.
4004780	4010500	You know, if there's anything that we learn from this game, it's you don't preorder games.
4010500	4016100	That's what can be learned from this game because you don't preorder games that you
4016100	4018220	don't know.
4018220	4021540	That you don't trust the reputation of the of the publisher.
4021540	4027840	Yes, but to that effect, if we were going to go with that logic, then we get cyberpunk
4027840	4031900	and you know, we know what happened with cyberpunk.
4031900	4037620	So it's I think it's you wait for the reviews to come out because you don't really necessarily
4037620	4041980	need those preorder bonuses because a lot of times it's just nonsense.
4041980	4049380	Oh, by the way, they also tried to sell DLC with this, one of which added elvish language
4049380	4053980	to the game, which elves are in the game for such a small period of time.
4053980	4057100	It's like almost insignificant altogether.
4057100	4062200	And they added like some moat for Gollum to like swat at flies in a game of single player.
4062200	4064260	Why do you need a moat at all?
4064260	4065660	What's the point of that?
4065660	4066660	Yes.
4066660	4067660	Disgusting.
4067660	4068660	Bad all around.
4068660	4069900	Like a disgusting.
4069900	4070900	It's awful.
4070900	4071900	Yeah.
4072820	4078140	Ah, um, TigerClawn chat raises a good point worth bringing up.
4078140	4082740	It's unfortunate because even developers make bad games but managed to come back when they
4082740	4084020	made a good one.
4084020	4085860	I mean, it is a fair point.
4085860	4089940	We've seen developers that make bad games, but they come around and they make a good
4089940	4090940	one.
4090940	4095100	You know, just because you make one bad game doesn't mean you're gonna make bad games forever.
4095100	4097920	Case in point, you've got ET playing behind you there.
4097920	4101780	Howard Scott Warshaw, who made ET made some of the greatest Atari 2600 games around.
4101780	4105300	We know, you know, if you do your history, you know, you know that, you know, there were
4105300	4110140	other circumstances at play with ET, such as deadlines and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4110140	4111540	Y'all know where I'm going with this.
4111540	4117820	So is a publisher that makes a bad game doomed to always make a bad game?
4117820	4122060	So I mean, even though we're looking at this going, haha, the Gollum developers, that game
4122060	4125120	was so bad, we knew this is gonna happen.
4125120	4128660	No one's like saying, wishing for the game to be bad.
4128660	4129940	It's just, it was bad.
4129940	4133740	I think it was even a delayed game that they deleted to make it better.
4133740	4137580	But it was like, like, how does that even ship?
4137580	4138580	Like who?
4138580	4139580	Yeah.
4139580	4140580	Who?
4140580	4141580	Who signed off on that?
4141580	4142580	That's what it is.
4142580	4145900	Who came up with those micro transaction things that are ridiculous?
4145900	4146900	Yeah.
4146900	4149020	Well, they signed off on releasing the game like that.
4149020	4151860	Like that's, that's, that's what needs to happen.
4151860	4152860	Yeah.
4152860	4156500	Micro transactions aside, like you could just play the game and see like, oh, this is not
4156500	4157500	ready to go.
4157500	4158780	Like, and I get it.
4158780	4162420	There's some, some of it might be, well, we're going to get backlash.
4162420	4166380	Well, we as maybe not the publisher, the publisher is probably not getting backlash.
4166380	4167940	Everyone's looking at the developer.
4167940	4169660	This developer didn't publish this game.
4169660	4171020	A publisher did.
4171020	4175140	And the publisher is the one responsible for saying, yeah, that's good to go to market.
4175140	4178580	So like, why aren't we getting mad at, I assume it's the eraser group.
4178580	4181460	I think that has the studio, like, why are we getting mad at them?
4181460	4183620	Like because they signed off on it.
4183620	4184620	Problems right now.
4184620	4188740	They don't need this on top of that, which, well, they do add this on top of that, unfortunately.
4188740	4195660	Well, manage your developers better than maybe, you know, you know, if you saw this obviously
4195660	4201940	was in bad shape for a very long time, it didn't just suddenly happen like, sorry.
4201940	4204620	It probably should have been canceled years ago.
4204620	4205620	Yeah.
4205620	4209780	You know, when it hit one of its benchmarks, somebody should have seen that this was terrible.
4209780	4213300	So missed, missed it on that.
4213300	4217180	And then on top of that, like, as you mentioned, like, even at the very best, it's a golem
4217180	4218180	game.
4218180	4220980	Like, yeah, exactly.
4220980	4224620	Take the worst character in Lord of the Rings and make the movies anyway, and make, make
4224620	4226860	a video game out of them.
4226860	4227860	Really?
4227860	4228860	Whose idea was that?
4228860	4229860	All right.
4229860	4230860	Moving on.
4230860	4232060	Let's talk about Nintendo.
4232060	4236140	Somebody that somebody that could get away with putting a bad game out there is actually
4236140	4240620	you want to talk about a studios that have made bad games occasionally, but then come
4240620	4243700	around and make really, really, really good ones like Tears of the Kingdom or what have
4243700	4246620	you, you know, plenty of good games from Nintendo.
4247060	4249260	Nintendo is thinking about their next console.
4249260	4250260	Of course they are.
4250260	4252020	They've been thinking about it for some time.
4252020	4256340	And they actually said in a shareholder meeting that because they were asked if your Nintendo
4256340	4260140	Switch purchases would carry over to future game consoles.
4260140	4265320	So the CEO and President Shintaro Furukawa said in the transition from Nintendo Switch
4265320	4269300	to the next generation console, we would like to make every effort to ensure that customers
4269300	4272820	can make the transition smoothly while using their Nintendo account.
4272820	4278620	So it seems to imply that Nintendo Switch titles purchased in the eShop will carry over
4278620	4279740	to what comes next.
4279740	4284140	But we don't know that for sure, but at least your account will move over because now you
4284140	4289260	have that central Nintendo account and you don't have to make like a console specific
4289260	4293220	account like you did on like 3DS, Wii U and everything else before that.
4293220	4294780	Everything is now on that Nintendo account.
4294780	4295780	I'm going to call it right now.
4295780	4297780	I'm going to say it right now.
4297780	4304740	100% I guarantee 100% this system will not be backwards compatible with the Switch.
4304740	4305740	100%.
4305740	4309340	The only thing that will come over is your Nintendo Switch, your Nintendo online account,
4309340	4311820	just like it did from the 3DS to the Switch.
4311820	4315820	100% guarantee it will never be backwards compatible with those games.
4315820	4316820	Why?
4316820	4317820	Because they don't know how to do it.
4317820	4322220	And also because the Switch is so old anyways that they just won't be able to do some sort
4322220	4324820	of compatibility, even though like the Steam Deck can run it.
4324860	4331220	I mean, certainly another console could probably pull off emulation for that, but for whatever
4331220	4332380	reason they won't do it.
4332380	4334540	It will not be backwards compatible.
4334540	4339140	I'm not so fast to put my head, hedge my bets on that.
4339140	4343620	I, you know, I'm looking at a DS 3DS kind of situation.
4343620	4348780	I think Nintendo knows they have a winner with the Switch and I don't think they're
4348780	4352620	going to be quick to repeat the mistakes of the Wii U and radically shake up the formula
4352620	4356020	that's working for them, at least not for this next console.
4356020	4360260	I do think the next console Nintendo puts out is basically going to be a Super Switch.
4360260	4361260	I could be wrong.
4361260	4365540	I think I think the Super Switch or whatever, and this is for lack of a better name, it
4365540	4371860	will have some quirky new mechanic that separates it a little bit, maybe like a camera built
4371860	4372860	in.
4372860	4374660	I don't know why my brain does that again.
4374660	4378820	I don't know why my camera, I don't know why my brain wants to go to the VR AR space.
4378820	4383140	I feel like it's a thing like Nintendo's like, I don't know, but we'll see.
4383140	4390860	But I think it will be some sort of Switch, but with a little something extra.
4390860	4398340	Well, I had already put out there once that it would be Switch 3D or Switch 3, meaning
4398340	4405660	it would switch to handheld television and virtual reality.
4405660	4411820	I know it's a long shot, but I feel like that would be the thing that Nintendo could
4411820	4415500	do to make the new Switch quirky would be to say it does VR.
4415500	4416900	We'll see though.
4416900	4420460	But I think whatever it is, it will support the old games.
4420460	4424340	But if they do something radically different and come up with a complete different type
4424340	4426520	of console, then yeah, I'm with you, Loki.
4426520	4429980	But I think just fundamentally, I don't think they deviate from the Switch that much.
4429980	4431900	They're going back to cartridge.
4431900	4432900	Going back to cartridges.
4432980	4435380	Well, they're using cartridges now in a sense.
4435380	4438100	So I mean, yeah, that's true.
4438100	4440980	Yeah, go back to this.
4440980	4442380	Yeah, go back to disks.
4442380	4442880	There you go.
4442880	4444820	Now you got it.
4444820	4450820	All right, let's move on Dark Sakura.
4450820	4452820	I put myself down a rabbit hole.
4452820	4453420	I'm sorry.
4453420	4456620	Anyway, good news coming up.
4456620	4462220	So and I actually got into this a little bit with the coworker the other day.
4462220	4465980	Steam, well, actually, I'll go back.
4465980	4475220	There's a Reddit post that is hinting that Valve may be banning games made with AI art.
4479220	4485260	It was basically noticed by the founder of Game Discover Co.
4485260	4491100	Simon Carlos said that there was a message from Valve
4491100	4496980	saying it cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all the necessary rights.
4496980	4504300	And another person wrote that Steam denied their game for utilizing AI tech.
4504300	4513140	And both of them had in common that some of their assets were AI generated.
4513180	4523740	So, yeah, they're very quietly banning the games that include AI created art assets.
4523740	4529540	Basically, if you can't prove that you own the right for the assets that trained those algorithms,
4529540	4532540	you can't have the thing in there.
4532540	4536100	No, no, no, no, that's not true for Steam.
4536100	4543020	You will, it's not necessarily that they can ban you if you admit it.
4543020	4550580	It's if you can't provide the proof, not necessarily an admission.
4550580	4561300	But at any rate, the rules themselves don't say anything about banning like AI made content,
4561300	4565780	as opposed to how they do like blockchain stuff.
4565780	4571740	But some of these ones have very obviously used AI generated art.
4571740	4581860	And, I mean, basically, any of us who are artists, you know, or who do graphic design,
4581860	4592100	or do, I mean, in general, it basically infringes on our potential ability to do this as a living,
4592100	4600220	you know, if someone can go to an AI generator and say, I need a logo that does this stuff.
4600220	4606180	What's to say they're not going to get that free logo with their, you know, mid journey account, right?
4606180	4609100	I now I will say that I have played with it.
4609100	4614220	And it was hilarious because I came up with Ballerina with three legs.
4614220	4625140	But I do not support the use of this for the purpose of making a game that you intend to make money on.
4625140	4629660	If you need art assets, you hire a fucking artist. End of story.
4629660	4638220	Or you pay for the art that has been submitted to, you know, stock accounts, you know, it's, it's,
4638220	4643420	well, and on top of that, I will say going back to what Ron Shawn said about artwork with a character with six fingers.
4643420	4648980	I mean, we did have the Princess Bride with the man with six fingers on his left hand, just saying.
4648980	4652420	That and Julian had an extra thumb when he was born.
4652420	4658140	But anyway, but Valve was basically putting out,
4658140	4666620	and this is a quote on here, unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has a sufficient rights to the training data.
4666620	4671820	And that it's also been denying games with AI made text.
4671820	4677740	So, so there's some people were talking about it being a hoax.
4677740	4683340	But honestly enough, though, it does bring up.
4683340	4694140	That. That basically it's something that needs to be a point of discussion.
4694140	4697260	Yeah, this is coming on top of that.
4697260	4705020	Yeah, if you are using a third party algorithm.
4705020	4712380	To generate artwork that you did not make instead of paying somebody.
4712380	4715980	Who does this for a living.
4715980	4718220	Then.
4718220	4723580	Yeah, and I went to a comment from in chat from fifth dream saying check my Twitter for my AI art.
4723580	4725420	Please tell me where I'm a bad person.
4725420	4728780	You're not because you're not trying to pass it off and sell it to somebody else.
4728780	4732220	That's the difference between what's going on here was you're not trying to pass it off as your own art.
4732220	4734620	So somebody else that's the difference should be very transparent.
4734620	4736940	I'm fucking around with AI art as dark soccer.
4736940	4737980	Just said she did too.
4738540	4739740	So I played with it.
4739740	4739980	Fuck it.
4739980	4740380	I did.
4741180	4746220	You know, I sent really funny examples to people and I certainly don't have a problem with.
4746460	4749420	Generating it as like an art reference for yourself.
4749420	4759020	Yeah, number one, you know, I if I can't find a body reference for something that I'm very specifically trying to draw.
4759020	4764460	Then yeah, I mean using using that as a reference for your own work.
4764460	4769980	Is one thing, but passing this off as something that you did.
4770780	4780780	No, passing it off as content for a game that you do not pay for this content and do not have rights to it or the material that supplied it.
4780780	4783580	The same, it's not yours.
4783580	4784540	Here's the thing.
4784540	4785340	It's a cult.
4785340	4790220	It's, it's, it's an amalgamation of other people's work.
4790220	4791980	So here's the thing.
4792060	4793340	So here's the thing.
4793340	4800700	I think AI is going to be here in this industry as the concept of machine learning.
4800700	4805020	You know, cause that's, that's basically, you know, we, we keep calling it AI, but it's based on machine learning.
4805020	4808780	And I think for me, the big question is how did the machine learn?
4809340	4817340	Because I think machine learning as a development concept is going to stay here in this industry and it's how the graphics are going to get better.
4817340	4824460	And how we're going to respond to the 8k and whatever else, 120 frames a second, whatever else becomes, it comes beyond that.
4824460	4828140	We all know, as it is today, games take a long time to develop.
4828140	4831900	And I think machine learning is going to probably accelerate that process.
4831900	4835580	But again, it comes back to the question of how did the machine learn?
4835580	4847260	If the studio developed the machine learning based off their own stuff, their own assets, their own thing to, you know, help them in a, which, which honestly, when it comes to level design, things like that, a lot of studios are already doing.
4847580	4848460	Then fine.
4848460	4853820	They built the technology they're teaching, they're teaching themselves how to do a better bed box.
4853820	4867980	But if the machine learning is coming from Reddit, the internet, things that artists who work for money and stuff put out there that then the machine learns from that's where artists are getting pissed off.
4867980	4869820	They don't want the machines learning from them.
4870380	4875660	And I need to actually define, because clearly people don't seem to actually know what machine learning is.
4876060	4878300	Machine learning starts with a database.
4879260	4881660	The machine doesn't know anything.
4881660	4885100	It is completely void and empty.
4886540	4895820	What you do is you put in existing information that the machine learns from things that it takes from these other sources.
4895820	4898060	It is not its own information.
4898060	4907020	It will try to extrapolate what it has from the information that was provided to it as a source.
4907020	4909100	It is not a human brain.
4909100	4911100	It does not have talent.
4911660	4914380	It does not have education behind it.
4914380	4919900	It is simply a query for a database with some more complex programming.
4920860	4924140	Fan art, since you bring it up, has zero to do with this.
4924140	4930860	Nor does fan writing because you can, number one, like Marissa just said, you cannot distribute them as your property.
4931500	4934780	They are considered works of transformative media.
4935340	4940940	Meaning that, first of all, they are under copyright protection no matter what Anne Rice has to say about it.
4941900	4943980	You cannot make money off of them.
4944940	4954220	It is put under free use and it does not use the thoughts and actions that come from other people.
4954220	4960060	You are not copying and pasting out of other people's writing directly from a book.
4960060	4963100	You are creating this scenario from your own mind.
4963100	4964300	That is a different thing.
4964940	4972460	If you put out, say, computer, use this data to write this fanfic, then that is a different story altogether.
4973100	4979980	You are completely, you do not understand what you are talking about, Fifth Dream, end of story.
4981420	4984700	End of story, you do not understand what you are talking about.
4984700	4985820	I think that is a little harsh.
4987980	4989420	Everybody is welcome to their perspective.
4990940	4994140	But opinions based on a lack of knowledge are not valid.
4994700	4997340	But Fifth Dream says, explain fan art boost at cons.
4998140	5004940	And I would say that when it comes to the fan art boost at cons, that thing has been a ticking time bomb for a long time.
5005580	5008380	But that is not the same as stealing someone's art.
5008380	5009580	No, it is not.
5009580	5012060	This is art in someone's own personal style.
5012060	5020460	But I am also pointing out, what I am trying to point out is that because that exists does not mean it is like completely, I am like, that is a ticking time bomb.
5020460	5024940	There is going to come a day when Nintendo or somebody, the problem is,
5024940	5026300	no, well, it is not really a problem.
5026300	5028780	Because again, I do not think they are a problem.
5028780	5033900	But what is going to happen someday, nobody wants to be the first company to do it.
5033900	5040220	But someday, there is going to be a company, Nintendo, that tries to shut that down.
5040940	5045740	And in the end, false equivalence like you are bringing up is a fallacious argument.
5045740	5047420	It does not qualify as an argument.
5048540	5051500	All right, I would say let us move on to something else for time.
5051500	5053260	Unfortunately, we have another AI story.
5053260	5054220	So let us get to it.
5055020	5062540	Yes, this is going to make it a little bit difficult with the whole not allowing AI art on Steam.
5062540	5069820	Because Unity is officially embracing AI with a couple new enhancements to Unity.
5071100	5074860	So they have now Unity Muse and Unity Centris.
5074860	5080220	So Unity Muse is a platform of AI capabilities for content creation.
5080220	5087420	They said with Muse chat for AI based search now in closed beta and AI powered experiences
5087420	5091180	at Unity runtime is also now in closed beta.
5093820	5103660	So based off of like their little sizzle reel that they had, it is generating like images as well.
5103660	5109420	So from what is a good question, since it has Muse in the title, I assume it is from Muse.
5110220	5114860	But yeah, Centris, I am not really sure what exactly that is either.
5114860	5119420	I know some of the complaints I have seen before with some of these is that like, for example,
5119420	5120780	you are saying generate this.
5120780	5126060	It is just pulling down assets like 3D models from the web for different things,
5126060	5127420	which is kind of annoying.
5127420	5132940	But you know, with that, of course, developers are very wary about what Unity is doing right now
5132940	5138380	and saying, you know, hey, you know, just to jump on the train, what data set y'all pulling the art
5138380	5144300	from? Unity fully needs to be transparent about what machine learning models will be implemented
5144300	5147180	during including the data that they have been trained on.
5147180	5148460	How the machine is learning.
5148460	5149500	There it is.
5149500	5151900	Yeah, I didn't even know that that was that was what was coming.
5151900	5152400	That's perfect.
5153020	5153980	Yeah, I don't need this.
5153980	5160060	I don't see any way machine learning in current iterations can be effective without training
5160060	5162940	on countless ill gotten data.
5162940	5165580	Really concerning image generation stuff.
5165580	5166780	What data sets?
5166780	5168940	Hi, what data sets was this train on?
5168940	5172700	You get the idea like this is the type of stuff that, you know, they're obviously concerned with
5172700	5178700	because as they should be, because imagine you're a developer and you're you decide to utilize this
5178700	5184140	in your game, you publish your game, all of a sudden you're getting a copyright claim because
5184140	5190460	some of the artwork that was in there was not acquired by Unity in a proper way.
5191100	5196940	Oh, now you have to pull your game off of, you know, steam because or you're in legal
5197500	5202540	trouble because, oh, yeah, it stole from this artwork to make this thing.
5204060	5205660	So that kind of sucks.
5205660	5211980	Where I would say that this is kind of what I could be useful for is, for example, if
5211980	5217260	I'm trying to implement something and it's just racking my brain how to code something
5217260	5223100	in a certain way, yes, AI would be nice to be able to like, say, hey, I want to write
5223100	5229420	a function that does this and then have it like spit out something for me and then I
5229420	5235180	could try plugging in and see if that works and or like, hey, can you write a better?
5235180	5240140	Can you take this code that I wrote and make it more performant or something like that?
5240140	5244380	Like, that's where I think this would be useful when it comes to AI generating art.
5244860	5246780	Yeah, like, I don't know.
5246780	5250860	They showed an example like animations like make this character do a backflip.
5250860	5254700	OK, but where is it getting that animation information from?
5254700	5259580	Unless it's they're doing like their own training and stuff on their own sets of material and
5259580	5262060	their own like capturing and stuff like that.
5262060	5263580	I just don't see that happening.
5263580	5267500	I see them cobbling this together in the cheapest way possible.
5268780	5269660	I can say this.
5270540	5274700	And I think fifth dream is finally starting to get the point with what he just said.
5274700	5277020	You trained it with your own image.
5277020	5277820	That's one thing.
5277820	5278540	That's your art.
5278540	5281180	Now, the thing is, is that I work in tech.
5281180	5282380	I can't say where I work.
5283900	5289580	But when like and like what you were just saying, Loki, with the material being used
5289580	5293260	to fit is provide if it's being taken without consent.
5294140	5298700	Well, what happens if someone walks into your house and runs off with your PlayStation without
5298940	5300060	your consent?
5300060	5301580	It's called stealing, right?
5303580	5303820	It's.
5306540	5312940	If it's with your own material or in the public domain, one thing, if it's taking from something
5312940	5317500	that other people have put their hard work into, for example, creating those animations
5317500	5321900	for their own games from scratch and another company is using them to build their machine
5321900	5323820	learning tool, that is stealing.
5324780	5328860	Let me try my very best to put this another way, and then I really want to move on because
5328860	5329980	we still have a lot of show to do.
5329980	5333420	I'm going to try my very best to explain this a different way, and I'm going to use this
5333420	5334540	show as an example.
5334540	5337420	So here's to me, here's the difference.
5337420	5340300	OK, there's a lot of OLR out there.
5340300	5343100	There's 966 episodes of OLR.
5343100	5350060	Hypothetically, somebody could feed all 966 episodes of the show into some one of these
5351020	5356380	little things, and they would be able to develop their own Orange Lounge Radio as a result,
5356380	5363340	because they could feed all of this show into a database or, you know, an AI thing, train
5363340	5367340	it the types of things we say, how we say them, how we respond to things.
5367340	5373100	Somebody could take this show, put it in one of these and churn out their own Orange Lounge
5373100	5373500	Radio.
5373500	5377980	And if you were to pass that off and then sell it or claim it as your own, to me, that's
5377980	5378460	stealing.
5379260	5380700	That absolutely is stealing.
5380700	5386140	And on top of that, it's not just, if I may, it's not just stealing.
5386140	5388220	It's misrepresentation of an entity.
5388220	5391260	But I want to make sure the other half of this is clear, because this is the important
5391260	5391900	distinction to me.
5392540	5397500	If you've been listening to OLR from the very beginning and you're like, I think this show
5397500	5397980	is great.
5397980	5398620	I love you guys.
5398620	5399340	And you're here every week.
5400220	5401180	To that, I say thank you.
5401180	5402300	I really do appreciate that.
5402300	5408220	And you go, you know what, Rob, Jamie, Loki, I'm so inspired by what you guys do.
5408700	5415020	I want to start my own podcast inspired by you guys, because I just I listen to you and
5415020	5416300	I think it's great.
5416300	5417900	I want to do my own thing.
5417900	5419260	Is that stealing?
5419260	5424140	No, because you're doing your own thing and we've inspired you.
5424140	5433900	But at the end of the day, did the machine learn from taking our information and analyzing
5433900	5435260	it and spitting it back out?
5435260	5440300	No, your brain, your human brain listened to it, was inspired by it.
5440300	5444780	But ultimately, you made the ultimate decision at the end of the day.
5445900	5449580	And so you were inspired by the show.
5449580	5451740	And that I would say would be okay.
5452540	5458380	Yes, SheHulk10 says, I'm on Grapefruit Lounge Radio sponsored by Fresca.
5460700	5464220	That's the biggest thing is that it gets down into the fundamentals
5464940	5470940	of where the source is, where the source is, and how it's being used.
5470940	5476700	And on top of that, then going into the ethical side of how is this going to affect people
5476700	5478620	who do this for their living?
5478620	5479180	All right.
5479180	5481980	I think we found a sliver of middle ground there.
5481980	5484220	So I'm going to take that, run with that, go to the next story.
5484220	5485500	So let's talk about.
5486140	5490220	Well, my whole thing is that I just don't think that there was an understanding of the
5490220	5491660	fundamentals of the idea.
5491660	5492160	That's all.
5492800	5496800	All right, let's talk about some Atari reveals.
5496800	5502400	And, you know, because I talked earlier in the show about Atari 50 and what, you know,
5502400	5504400	some of the things that they've been doing with that.
5504400	5507760	And let's talk about some other things that Atari has in store.
5507760	5512320	They're going to be making some games called Quantum Recharge and Haunted House.
5512320	5513440	Here's the interesting thing.
5513440	5518480	Again, there is actually a Haunted House reboot, remaster, whatever in this Atari.
5518480	5523280	This is yet taking that same IP and making something else out of it.
5523280	5528240	So, you know, again, if you want to run your own thing through machine learning, that's
5528240	5528480	fine.
5528480	5530320	That's what Atari keeps doing.
5530320	5531120	That's fine.
5531120	5532640	Okay, bad joke, but I tried.
5534080	5539280	But Quantum Recharged is, this is going to be similar to Yars Recharge, Gravatar Recharge.
5539280	5541280	These are the games that already exist on Steam.
5541280	5543040	Quantum Recharged is this.
5543040	5545440	Quantum was the 1982 arcade title.
5545440	5548160	It's a little bit lesser known, but it is an Atari 50.
5548160	5549360	It's a vector based game.
5549360	5555360	You use a trackball to get dots and shapes, kind of like Kix, but that's very much a,
5556000	5556960	yeah, not quite.
5557680	5561840	And then Haunted House is a reimagining, of course, of the 1981 game Haunted House.
5561840	5566160	It looks a little more like a Diablo type of game or a Minecraft dungeons, if you will.
5566160	5571600	It's a little bit more of a, you know, dungeon crawler, which, if you think about it, are
5571600	5575280	kind of rooted in the original Haunted House game, ironically enough.
5575280	5580720	So I'm not sure how, I feel like, I don't know if a lot of Atari's stuff like this ends
5580720	5584560	up being very quality when it is a little bit derivative of modern stuff, but we'll
5584560	5584720	see.
5584720	5588400	I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, because at least they've been hitting and
5588400	5592800	missing lately, which is better than only missing, which is where I feel like they were
5592800	5593920	at for a long time.
5593920	5595360	So I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.
5595360	5597920	I would like to see how this Haunted House turns out.
5597920	5603040	Quantum Recharged Haunted House coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Switch, and
5603040	5605120	of course, the Atari VCS.
5605120	5608240	Yes, that's still a thing in the press release later this year.
5608880	5609280	All right.
5610000	5611120	Oh, geez.
5611120	5615040	With that, since I brought up Atari, a great chance to take a trip down memory lane.
5615040	5616400	Therefore, bring on the bump.
5626960	5632480	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5632480	5634800	out a classic and tell you about it.
5634800	5637440	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5638080	5645280	But once a month, Dark Soccer likes to mix it up and pick a non-video game to highlight.
5645280	5650800	And Dark Soccer, I really think I should just showcase this by playing this little ditty
5650800	5651840	for everybody here.
5651840	5652960	I think you will agree.
5652960	5654560	Yeah, let's start off with that.
5654560	5655120	I agree.
5655120	5656160	Let's roll the clip here.
5656800	5658640	It's some time in the future.
5659680	5661040	The ultimate challenge.
5662160	5663120	Crossfire.
5672320	5672960	All right.
5672960	5676400	You know what it is, which I swear to God came up on this show not that long ago.
5676400	5678000	I was like, Jamie, did you pick a duplicate?
5678000	5681520	But no, it's just this game came up in normal conversation.
5681520	5682240	I'm pretty sure.
5683200	5691520	I actually believe that it was this game that inspired me to do this as the segment.
5692080	5697520	My brothers and I had this, and I can tell you that I almost broke my face open, tripping
5697520	5698720	over those little ball bearings.
5699600	5701680	I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh at that.
5701680	5703840	I just, the way you tell that story is humorous.
5705440	5710640	My brothers were using them as ammo for whatever they were playing with.
5710640	5711280	Oh my gosh.
5711280	5712960	Maybe transformers or something.
5714000	5715200	Anyway, Crossfire.
5716080	5722480	It's a game that was created by the Milton Bradley company in 1971.
5722480	5723680	This game's older than me.
5727680	5731120	And basically you have these two pucks.
5731120	5735920	One of them is sort of spirally and the other one is sort of triangular and you have to
5735920	5739680	shoot these little ball bearings at the puck using your little shooting guns.
5741360	5745360	Until they hit the other side.
5746400	5750400	But because the pucks are also on their own ball bearings, they can spin a little bit.
5751360	5756160	The original version of it had a very flat play field.
5757200	5762640	And then the later ones were a little bit dome shaped so that the ball bearings on the
5762640	5764240	pucks would roll a bit more easily.
5764960	5774160	But also it could prevent the little balls from, you know, staying on the field and not
5774160	5778960	being able to be picked up by, you know, the player to refill their little gun.
5780640	5787200	And then in the 2010s, the re-release just gave it slightly slip to the more shallow
5787200	5792080	grade that would keep the pucks from sliding on their own as much.
5792160	5794240	So they've gone through some revisions.
5794800	5798640	So basically the two pucks, like I was saying, they have a ball bearing and they are made
5798640	5804880	of plastic and the bearing can spin and roll with that plastic so the pucks will spin around
5804880	5806960	and move and be more responsive to the hits.
5808080	5816560	So basically the object is to get either piece to your opponent's goal and the first for
5816560	5817840	three goals wins.
5818400	5825440	So, of course, the thing that most of us remember, not necessarily the 1971 edition, but the
5825440	5832560	1990s commercial that we just saw, that it was the post-apocalyptic crossfire.
5834320	5844640	And that, wow, apparently the winner in that exchange, I just read this, was someone named
5845520	5849920	Tim Maynard, a Shakespearean actor who went to daytime soap opera acting.
5850800	5851520	The more you know.
5853200	5865760	Anyway, but yeah, the game wasn't as intense as they made it look on the commercial.
5868480	5872320	Because the problem is that you had to scoop up all the little bearings and put them back
5872320	5881600	in your gun, which of course, if you're planning to get somebody with better aim, then they're
5881600	5885200	going to take advantage of the slowdown that you have when you're putting the bearings
5885200	5887520	in and, you know, send it out.
5889200	5895200	But yeah, I'm trying to see if I can find a picture of the 1971 version because, oh
5895200	5898160	yeah, 1971 crossfire.
5898160	5899760	Rob, can I show you this?
5899760	5901600	Well, I was going to see if I could YouTube it real quick.
5901600	5902480	I just sat back down.
5902480	5902720	Sorry.
5902720	5904560	I snuck AFK to use the potty, but I'll see.
5904560	5905520	Yeah, I just found it.
5905520	5906880	I just found the YouTube video.
5906880	5907380	Okay.
5907840	5908340	Yes.
5909200	5912560	I bet I can probably find it too, but give me a moment here.
5912560	5913520	We'll bring it up.
5913520	5914240	Yeah.
5914240	5916560	Let's look up crossfire 1971.
5916560	5921200	But anyway, yeah, it's quite a bit different of a creature.
5922400	5923920	It's very plain.
5923920	5928720	It almost looks kind of like an old air hockey, you know, table, but
5929040	5934480	the, the game itself, it has been through all those different iterations of it.
5935120	5940800	And I can see why they went with this theme when they did in the nineties, cause it is
5940800	5948240	very nineties, but the one thing that I can't find is what the sales rates were like for
5948240	5948740	this.
5951200	5953360	Let me, let me try one other place.
5953920	5955120	Let me try one other place.
5957920	5960880	It says actually the average game lasts for 10 minutes.
5961840	5969760	And yeah, there's, there's no notice on here for, for how well it's sold or anything.
5969760	5970640	That's a little sad.
5970640	5972720	I was hoping to find a little bit more about it.
5973280	5979840	The 1971 one is way less cool looking, but it's very, very 1970s looking like even just
5979840	5983520	like down to the font that's on the table is very like seventies table game.
5985440	5986560	Oh, seriously.
5987200	5995120	And I'm, I'm actually a little bit, a little bit sad that I can't find, you know, what
5995120	5996640	the sale was like.
5996640	6003520	I even looked at BoardGameGeek and tried a few other sources, but nah, no one, no one
6003520	6006320	says, although you can buy replacement balls for it on Amazon.
6006880	6007680	That's convenient.
6007680	6016320	Yeah, I kind of want one now, but someone has it on, uh, Amazon for 70 bucks and I'm
6016320	6019280	not paying 70 bucks for a game they tried to kill me once.
6022560	6022960	All right.
6022960	6024800	Game that tried to kill me.
6025840	6026560	Is that, is that it?
6026560	6027200	Crossfire.
6027200	6027440	All right.
6027440	6028160	There it is.
6028160	6030000	Am I, is that, and the B-roll, are we done?
6030000	6030500	Okay.
6030880	6031440	There it is.
6032080	6037040	Your classic non-video game of the month, Crossfire.
6037760	6038560	You're living in it.
6038560	6038960	That's it.
6038960	6042640	My next segment for next year is going to be games that tried to kill me.
6046400	6050080	Maybe I should, maybe I should just do like, uh, games that make me rage.
6050800	6054880	You still have a good seven months or no, not seven, but five months figured out.
6054880	6055840	So you got time.
6055840	6056960	How about all of them?
6056960	6057760	All of the above.
6057760	6058260	All right.
6058720	6062960	A random category, classic game category of the month.
6064400	6064900	All right.
6065920	6066960	Let's move on.
6066960	6068320	We have some rapid fire news.
6068320	6071040	That's one thing that hasn't changed on the show in a very long time.
6071040	6073680	We travel around and look at some other headlines real quick.
6073680	6074480	Let's start with Loki.
6075600	6080640	Apparently, uh, during, during the Annapurna interactive showcase, which happened last
6080640	6088000	week, um, there was a brand new game from Keita Takahashi that looked, uh, like a brand
6088000	6095920	new game, uh, called, I guess, T um, it's about a, or it's a, I'm not sure.
6095920	6096160	Yeah.
6096160	6097840	T I guess is the name of the game.
6097840	6108080	And it's about a teen that is stuck T posing and trying to fit in to like, I guess a, the
6108080	6110640	plastic lifestyle of a quaint seaside town.
6110640	6111920	It's a 3d puzzle game.
6113440	6114640	To a T they call it.
6115600	6116880	It looks funny.
6116880	6121680	I like, I like quirky games like that, so I'm not sure when this is coming out, but
6121680	6123920	they know that guy's the one that's going to make quirky games.
6123920	6125680	So yeah, absolutely.
6126080	6127360	Yeah, no release date yet.
6127360	6133200	It's coming out though on X-Box one, X-Box series and PC at some point.
6133200	6134000	Oh my God.
6134560	6136400	X-Box exclusivity.
6137760	6139840	They shouldn't be able to buy Activision Blizzard now.
6142720	6146400	In the game that I would, I'm going to call a crack for Rob.
6147040	6156560	Uh, we have the unholy abomination of a crossover of hello kitty in a Stardew Valley animal
6156560	6158480	crossing style game.
6159120	6165040	Um, it is called, uh, let's see, hello kitty Island adventure.
6166160	6168400	I'm sorry for your loss of time, Rob.
6169200	6170800	Well, here's the gag.
6170800	6171200	Hold on.
6171200	6174320	I'm trying to put the little, um, thing on the other screen.
6174320	6180640	I have received several direct messages on a similar notion this week about, uh, oh,
6180640	6183840	I see that they have mixed hello kitty with animal crossing.
6183840	6186080	Sorry to hear about your life being over.
6186080	6189520	Um, it's, it's a mobile game.
6189520	6192240	I'm not really interested in playing this on a mobile platform.
6192240	6199440	Now I've just poured it if this, yeah, if this were on switch or, you know, um, I don't
6199440	6201920	know, like a PlayStation or something.
6201920	6204080	Yeah, I could see it being dangerous.
6204080	6208800	But as it stands right now, like I'm not trying to like crap on mobile games.
6208800	6212000	I'm just not interested in playing a game like this on a mobile device.
6212000	6214400	So that's just where it stands for me.
6214400	6215120	So fair enough.
6215680	6220400	Um, if someone is interested in playing, it's coming out July 28th on Apple devices.
6221360	6223600	All right, let's move on.
6224160	6224800	Dark soccer.
6226560	6231840	So, um, there is, uh, well, sad news.
6232640	6237600	So, um, the music producer, um, Akira complex has died.
6238480	6243680	Um, it was announced by attack the music, which is an LA based record label that they
6243680	6245280	did some albums with.
6245280	6252000	Um, but a lot of the work that was, uh, done was for dance, dance revolution.
6252800	6257840	Um, and, uh, apparently it seems to have been suicide.
6258560	6265280	So, um, so their family and friends sending best wishes.
6266320	6271680	Um, yeah, they also, of course, I forgot to mention did stuff for sound full text,
6271680	6274880	dance, fresh stardom, beat mania, two DX, and a few others.
6275680	6281760	And apparently I think one of the last, uh, or one of the best known albums was from 2018
6281760	6282640	hyper synthetic.
6283520	6288240	So, but at any rate, uh, may their memory be a blessing.
6288240	6291040	And again, thoughts go out to their family.
6291040	6293360	Their music is still with us through these games.
6293360	6297920	And we know these Bahmani games are quite the cult favorites and, you know, the musical
6297920	6299520	live on for a long, long time.
6299520	6302320	Uh, dark to see us as I do believe one of the guys that hung out with us back in the
6302320	6303360	day is that attack the music.
6303360	6306240	Now, isn't that, isn't that what Bahmani style kind of turned into?
6306240	6308480	Or am I, am I mixing up my record labels?
6308480	6310480	I can, it's been a long time, admittedly.
6311200	6316880	I thought they kind of kind of transitioned from that into doing their own music label
6316880	6317920	of that type of music.
6317920	6319280	So I could be wrong though.
6319280	6321120	Um, it's been a long time.
6322000	6327360	Uh, anyway, uh, let's talk about, uh, what's going on on the various consoles as far as
6327360	6329280	the subscription programs.
6329280	6331280	So, um, Oh, it's Oda quest.
6331280	6331520	Thank you.
6331520	6332400	Dark to see you.
6332400	6332720	Okay.
6332720	6334080	So I'm just mixing up my names.
6334080	6335280	Apologies.
6335280	6336880	There's a lot of y'all to keep track of.
6336880	6337680	All right.
6337680	6340000	Um, let's talk about what's going on on PlayStation.
6340080	6346080	PlayStation plus monthly games for July, 2023 include call of duty, black ops, cold war.
6347120	6347360	Cool.
6347360	6351280	For some people, I guess, uh, N Ling extinction is forever.
6352320	6354400	That's like your cute little indie title.
6354400	6356240	And I'm interested in this one for sure.
6356240	6358240	Alan Wake remastered.
6358240	6361920	So not to be confused with the original Alan Wake, this is the actual remastered version
6361920	6364320	that came out not a terribly long time ago.
6364880	6368160	Probably in preparation of Alan Wake two is a good time to do it.
6368880	6375280	If you're on the Xbox system, you can pick up these on Xbox live games with gold from
6375280	6377600	the first to the 31st of July.
6377600	6380320	Darkwood is the game that is available.
6380320	6385200	And then from July 16th to August 15th, cause they, they flip things out, uh, in the middle
6385200	6387120	of the month as well on Xbox.
6387120	6393520	When the past was around, this is a love story of Etta and owl, who I do not believe is an
6393520	6396800	actual owl, but it is a point and click adventure type of game.
6397360	6399360	And supposedly has a really beautiful music with it.
6399360	6400320	I'll have to check that out.
6400320	6402000	I'm a sucker for a good music score in a game.
6402000	6402720	That's for damn sure.
6403760	6407920	And Hey, I know usually we just talk about PlayStation plus and Xbox games with gold,
6407920	6414160	but a new challenger approaches because Nintendo is adding to Nintendo switch online in the
6414160	6416160	Sega Genesis expansion packs.
6416160	6420480	They have to have the expansion pack, but you have four pretty good games available
6420480	6424480	on the Sega Genesis online, uh, that will be available.
6424480	6426000	I think is available now.
6426000	6427680	I think they came out of this last week.
6427680	6428180	Yes.
6428640	6430080	Revenge of Shinobi.
6430080	6430880	Cool.
6430880	6431840	Ghouls and ghosts.
6432560	6437120	Land Stalker and Crusader of senti are all out.
6437120	6442800	If you have expansion pass, excuse me, expansion pack for a Nintendo switch online, which I
6442800	6446560	still don't, but one of these days I'll probably break down and get it.
6447280	6448160	All right.
6448160	6452240	If none of those recent releases are good enough for you, let's talk about some recent
6452240	6456320	recent releases as we travel around the world and check out some release dates starting
6456320	6457920	in the U S for games this week.
6457920	6461040	Loki and not a lot this week, unfortunately.
6461040	6467120	Uh, so we've got a game called scarf coming out on PlayStation four, PlayStation five,
6467120	6476000	Xbox one and Xbox series, sentimental death loop on Nintendo switch and legends of heroes
6476000	6482720	trails into reverie on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
6482720	6483220	That's it.
6484400	6484900	All right.
6486320	6489760	Let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases on the Nintendo switch.
6489760	6495520	You know, it's almost as if somebody in Japan heard my complaints about hello kitty island
6495520	6498560	adventure, because look at what they're releasing on the Nintendo switch this week.
6499680	6504800	Pretty princess magical garden island is one release you can look forward to this week.
6505680	6510720	And in this game, you get money and gratitude points for doing requests for the island
6510720	6511600	residents.
6511600	6515600	And you can personalize, you'll create the farm of your dreams all while being a pretty
6515600	6517200	princess at the same time.
6517200	6519120	And, and there is a bunny.
6519120	6520640	I'm just going to say that there's a bunny.
6521360	6521860	All right.
6522800	6525280	If that's not good enough for you, guess what?
6526560	6532800	You've got little friends, puppy Island also available this week.
6532800	6536080	It's kind of like Nintendogs, but they don't make that game anymore.
6536080	6538720	So somebody else decided to do their own spin on it.
6538720	6544080	And they took the Nintendogs on holiday where you can build the ultimate puppy paradise.
6544640	6547920	I have some friends that would take that to mean an entirely different thing, but we're
6547920	6550000	not going to go there on this program tonight.
6550960	6555600	If neither of those games are up your alley, perhaps trouble, which is final episode one
6555600	6559280	daughters of amlogram, uh, will, uh, be up your alley.
6559280	6563040	That is also available in Japan this week on the Nintendo switch.
6563040	6570000	Let's take a look real quick at the PlayStation five, just one release, but it's F1 2023.
6570000	6577120	So if you want to get your race on in Japan, you can do that with F1 2023 from EA out of
6577120	6579040	Japan this week, dark Sakura.
6579040	6579680	How about the UK?
6579680	6584800	Um, uh, one thing on the fourth, um,
6588160	6591600	um, I don't know why, but you cut out all of a sudden we just heard the,
6591600	6593520	Oh, that was a weird blip.
6593520	6593920	I'm sorry.
6593920	6597760	We just had an audio blip and all we heard was on the fourth and then it cut out.
6597760	6598260	Okay.
6599200	6606160	So on the fourth, um, X, uh, versus ATV legends on PlayStation and Xbox.
6606160	6607600	And it's not a holiday over there.
6607600	6608160	So whatever.
6608800	6614880	Well, after a certain quarter of nine last week, I don't think we're having a holiday.
6614880	6617520	This year's holiday is canceled as far as I'm concerned over here.
6617520	6620400	So, but I will be still taking the day off for it.
6620960	6621280	All right.
6622160	6625600	Well, I mean, I'm already off anyway, so I guess I get paid on it.
6627840	6630560	I will be celebrating the art of napping that day.
6631360	6634880	I will be celebrating it not being a fucking hundred plus degrees that day.
6635280	6636240	That too.
6636240	6636720	You're here.
6636800	6637280	You're here.
6638320	6638640	All right.
6639600	6646400	We have a few more headlines for you, and then we will get to listen around table, but first Loki.
6647520	6647760	Yeah.
6647760	6652560	So one of the, uh, popular games of the moment is only up.
6652560	6660880	It is kind of long lines of the, um, Bennett Foddy games where they're incredibly stressful,
6660880	6662400	hard platformers.
6662400	6662800	Oh God.
6662800	6664960	It's been pulled from steam.
6664960	6670400	And the reason for that is because there was artwork featured in the game from a 3d artist
6671760	6673840	who had that available to purchase.
6673840	6679520	However, it was for non-commercial use and they used it for commercial purposes.
6680160	6687200	So now, um, they have to work that out, I guess, until the game, you know, is, um, available
6687200	6690800	or, you know, I guess they could patch it and remove that piece of artwork or something.
6690800	6691600	Maybe, I don't know.
6691600	6697280	It's it is a platformer game where you have to jump a bunch of, uh, models or jump on
6697280	6698640	a bunch of models of things.
6698640	6705200	So I have never heard of this game somehow in my, and yet I follow gaming.
6705200	6707360	Um, it's a popular streamer game.
6707360	6707760	Yeah.
6707760	6710400	I I'm looking, I just pulled it up to see what this is about.
6710400	6712480	It looks, I guess, pretty.
6713200	6718480	Usually these indie darlings that really take off on Twitch have kind of like retro graphics.
6718480	6721280	So I'm looking at this one going, Oh, this one actually looks kind of nice.
6721280	6724400	So it's like kind of a bunch of assets kind of thrown together.
6724400	6730560	Um, but you know, um, about it though, like the other thing, this is also had some controversy
6730560	6738720	with it as well, because originally the game, um, had some sort of NFT promotion, but then
6738720	6744400	of course there was rules against a tease on steam as well as selling, um, if you're
6744400	6747680	selling and buying them in game rather than simply promoting with them.
6747680	6752320	So I guess, I don't know, it it's been kind of a mix.
6752320	6753840	The game itself looks okay.
6753840	6756800	There's been people that have been watching that have been trying to speed run it, but
6757360	6760720	um, yeah, I'm curious to see whether that's going to happen now that it's been pulled
6760720	6761360	from steam.
6761360	6762720	I think you can still play it though.
6762720	6764240	If you have it, I'd assume.
6765280	6765680	Oh yeah.
6766560	6769200	They, they can't like take that from you once you bought it.
6769200	6772000	So I think it's part of the agreement you have with steam.
6772000	6774800	So, um, interesting.
6774800	6775520	Yeah.
6775520	6778400	Um, but, uh, it's, it's, uh, yeah.
6778400	6784240	Usually these games that kind of take off on steam are not, do you think it's a Phoenix?
6784240	6787040	It's a only up is the name of the game.
6787040	6787280	Yeah.
6787280	6790080	It's, it's kind of like a getting over it type game.
6790080	6792400	So, yeah, I would say Twitch.
6792400	6795360	I might've said steam, but it's cause I was looking at the headlines, but I meant like
6795360	6796000	Twitch.
6796000	6800640	It's interesting how, you know, games can really be made on Twitch.
6800640	6804640	Meaning like, you know, I look at a game like vampire survivors is kind of a recent
6804640	6809600	example where it caught a lot of, you know, headwind on Twitch and more and more people
6809600	6810240	played it.
6810240	6814320	But of course, I think just, even if you want to go way back, hell Minecraft in a, in a
6814320	6819280	way it was, you know, hugely made popular because of Twitch among us, obviously another
6819280	6822320	example of that in the game we brought up on the show tonight, five nights at Freddy's,
6822320	6825600	I think to some extent, maybe a little more YouTube on that one, but still, you know,
6825600	6827200	content and creators.
6827760	6835360	Um, it's, it's very interesting to me how much Twitch can really kind of elevate a game
6835360	6837440	to such a huge level of success like that.
6839040	6839440	Yeah.
6839440	6840000	Yeah.
6840000	6840960	And it's fascinating.
6841520	6842160	Anyway.
6842160	6842480	All right.
6842960	6843600	Let's move on.
6844160	6845440	I think Jamie stepped AFK.
6845440	6848080	So look, you do want to go to the next story you had and we'll go back to hers.
6848720	6849120	Yeah.
6849120	6849680	Sounds good.
6850720	6856800	So this is funny because actually this is a little bit more of a local story, if you
6856800	6857300	will.
6857760	6866880	So, um, Dave's retro games in, out of Sacramento, California, um, down at the Folsom flea market.
6866880	6869120	I think it's Folsom flea market is what they call it.
6869120	6870080	It is.
6870080	6873200	Cause when I first saw this story, I was like, Oh, is it out of denial?
6873200	6875360	And I was like, Oh, it's at that place.
6875360	6877280	Well, I think I've been there.
6877280	6878720	I've been there once.
6878720	6878880	Yeah.
6878880	6880320	I've been in this one too.
6880320	6882240	I actually, uh, not that long ago.
6882240	6885440	And I would never go there on a day like today because that whole place is hot.
6886080	6886880	Balls.
6886880	6890160	It was, yeah, it was hot when it was like 80 degrees down there.
6890160	6891600	So like, yeah, absolutely.
6891600	6892400	No way.
6892400	6895920	Um, but yeah, they, he's had the store for 35 years.
6895920	6902720	Funny enough, back when I was in my previous role, a previous job, I actually almost was
6902720	6907040	selling to this guy, except he, he wanted to buy used product and we didn't really have
6907040	6907600	any of that.
6907600	6913520	And when it came to game stuff, but my coworker dealt with him on a direct basis for selling
6913520	6916000	used VHS tapes at this time.
6917920	6920560	But yeah, so he is trying to get out of the business.
6921120	6927360	He has posted his business up on Craigslist and looking for a buyer for $1 million.
6928560	6936000	Says he has about 35 years and 20,000 games there and looking to sell everything with
6936000	6936500	it.
6937360	6939680	That's one, one way to get rid of your inventory.
6940320	6940820	Yeah.
6941840	6943120	Here's the problem though.
6944000	6945120	This is the rub here.
6945120	6949600	And they did a little piece I saw on like good day, Sacramento as well, talking about
6949600	6950080	it and stuff.
6950080	6954320	He was showing off like some of the products they had like talking about like video game
6954320	6954820	collecting.
6955680	6959200	The fact that he has that kind of inventory isn't necessarily notable.
6959200	6960960	It's what condition it is in.
6960960	6967360	And as a personal, my personal experience with his inventory, it's trash.
6967360	6968800	It is garbage.
6968800	6976160	It is in such a disarray, disorganized mess with like the quality of like loose games
6976160	6977440	and the labels falling off.
6977440	6981920	And so I remember when we went there, I was looking for specific like NES games and good
6981920	6985760	luck finding them because there is no organization to it whatsoever.
6985760	6990640	Just all out of all sorts of order, just stacked on top of each other, like behind a glass
6990640	6991200	case.
6991200	6994400	He's got a few box games, but like he was showing, it's like, Oh yeah, Pokemon.
6994400	6996960	This one's, this is a sealed copy of Pokemon.
6997040	7000800	It's worth a lot of money, but you look at the box and the box is just smashed the hell.
7000800	7006480	Like it's just he is delusional if he's thinking he's going to get a million dollars for this
7006480	7007520	is what I'm saying.
7008480	7010080	Yeah, like good luck.
7010080	7014160	But like I was not of like particularly impressed when I went there.
7014160	7016160	Just there was nothing there for me.
7016160	7019760	Granted, it was years ago, you know, and I don't know what's changed because it was before
7019760	7020640	the pandemic for sure.
7020640	7022960	And probably even like 2017 was right when I was there.
7022960	7024000	It was a long time ago.
7024000	7026400	Yeah, well, we went not that long ago.
7026400	7028160	It was probably about a year or two ago.
7028160	7031040	So like, it was not in good shape.
7031040	7033600	Like I know there was another guy that was at denial.
7033600	7034320	Oh, that guy.
7034320	7035440	Maybe the same.
7035440	7035760	Yeah.
7037440	7039680	I was wondering if you'd been to this play star, Zara.
7039680	7040320	Oh, of course.
7041760	7043440	Do you remember Trader Dan?
7044400	7046080	That was the one that's in denial.
7046080	7047120	Yeah, that's him.
7048000	7048320	Okay.
7048320	7050080	Yeah, this guy's at Folsom.
7050080	7051680	No, this guy's at the Folsom market.
7051680	7051920	Yeah.
7052480	7052880	Okay.
7052880	7053360	Okay.
7053360	7061600	Yeah, because, I mean, we used to go to when Trader Dan was in the, I can't remember the
7061600	7064800	community now, but we used to go out there.
7064800	7068560	But yeah, anyway, God crazy.
7068560	7069060	Yeah.
7069760	7070160	All right.
7070160	7072240	Well, let's go Dark Soccer.
7072240	7076480	You were going to talk about, since we're talking about retro games, an interesting
7076480	7077280	rerelease, right?
7078240	7078480	Yeah.
7079040	7083280	Although, I mean, it's hard for me to think of one of these as obscure because I've
7083280	7084560	had a copy forever.
7086080	7096160	But Retrobit is doing two rereleases for Sega Genesis slash Mega Drive.
7097200	7098080	Pre-orders are up.
7098720	7107120	But one of them is Syldis, which we had for Sega CD a Sylfis with an F.
7107120	7115760	But it was released in 1990 for the Sharp X68000, also as Sylfis.
7117440	7121600	The game is a fun shooter.
7121600	7123440	It has really beautiful artwork on it.
7123440	7126400	So it's a horizontal shooter by Wolf Team.
7126400	7130080	I have not done it as a classic game yet, but maybe I will.
7130960	7135360	And then the other one is El Viento, which is a side scrolling action game that came
7135360	7138080	out in 1991, also by Wolf Team.
7138080	7140880	And it had a female protagonist.
7140880	7147200	It is definitely that 90s anime style, you know, dirty pair Cutie Honey looking.
7148000	7151120	I mean, like later Cutie Honey, not like 70s Cutie Honey.
7151120	7151680	But anyway.
7152400	7158320	But yeah, they're coming with the slipcover, clamshell case, cartridge, the manual.
7159200	7168720	And each of these are open to order from now to July 30th for $54.99 US and to ship out Q4.
7170880	7171380	All right.
7173120	7174160	Listen up, collectors.
7175120	7178080	Although if you're a true collector, you already have it, right?
7179840	7185120	If you're an even truer collection, you have the X68000 and you've got the original discs.
7185920	7189600	Uh, Dartitsia in chat says, I remember Soul Feast on Sega CD.
7189600	7192800	Not as familiar with El Viento, but it seems like a fun action platformer.
7192800	7194160	Soul Feast was fun, though.
7194160	7198320	Wouldn't top Gradius in the shmup department, but more shmups aren't a bad thing.
7199200	7200480	It wasn't a bad game at all.
7200480	7203440	It was in a saturated market, I will admit.
7204240	7207680	Questmaster says, I wish they'd also reissue Ernest Evans.
7208960	7213440	So lots of, uh, lots of old school releases.
7214000	7216400	I'm still waiting for the Guardian Legend to be remade.
7216400	7218640	That's, that's, that's it.
7218640	7224080	Once, once somebody finally remakes the Guardian Legend, I've hit all I want in game.
7224080	7224580	What?
7224800	7225600	That I couldn't think of.
7225600	7226720	We're playing Gaiden.
7227520	7228480	Oh, really?
7228480	7229360	Play the Japanese one.
7229360	7229860	Oh, fun.
7229860	7231840	The game couldn't get past the first level.
7231840	7234240	Don't tell him I said so.
7234240	7235200	You just ratted him out.
7235200	7235700	All right.
7236080	7237920	I don't know if I could anymore, to be honest.
7237920	7240000	It's been forever since I really sat down and played that game.
7240000	7240960	I should do that on stream.
7240960	7246320	And I did it with a, on a, um, on a delay on the, the big TV in the front room.
7247520	7250800	Dr. C says, I did pitch TGL to the folks at Bitwave.
7250800	7251920	So cross your fingers.
7251920	7256320	Who the, well, we, we went down this rabbit hole of who owns the rights anymore.
7256320	7256720	Right.
7256720	7261440	So it's just when somebody wants to make it, they'll make it, they'll pony up the money.
7261440	7261940	Anyway.
7262480	7264160	Uh, let's talk about one more.
7264160	7268560	So earlier we were talking a little bit about how like a game can be made or broken.
7268560	7269520	Well, not broken.
7269520	7272560	I was just saying a game can be made and bolstered up by Twitch.
7272560	7278480	I have never heard of a game not making it because of its Twitch performance, but this
7278480	7279600	is a very interesting thing.
7279600	7283040	It's crash team rumble is the game we're going to talk about.
7283040	7287520	And there's some headlines going around about how it's struggling on Twitch.
7287520	7293200	Uh, a website video gamer has noted that the total number of Twitch users watching crash
7293200	7296560	team rumble has sunk pretty low.
7296560	7302880	It's only down to like double figures, meaning like 40 people on all of Twitch watching this
7302880	7309920	game, even though, uh, it was like 12,000 at its peak, the average is somewhere a little
7309920	7312800	more in like the 300 type of range now.
7312800	7318720	Um, that's not great, but that also probably has to do with the fact that the game really
7318720	7320720	didn't review very well.
7320720	7326640	Um, also, uh, like to put it in perspective, aliens, dark descent, which was an RTS game
7326640	7332480	that was released the same day as crash team rumble has about an average of 4,600 viewers
7332480	7333840	over the last week.
7333840	7338160	Uh, and at the same time, it was noted that 40 people were playing crash team rumble about
7338160	7344640	2,200 were playing alien stark descent, uh, F1 23, which was also released, uh, at least
7344640	7351520	here anyway, uh, 4,700 final fantasy 16, 50,000, which isn't very surprising to hear
7351520	7352560	about that at all.
7353200	7357760	Um, but of course, crash team rumble, it's got a Metacritic score of 68.
7357760	7359920	Why do we care about how it's doing on Twitch?
7359920	7364560	Because the game play and crash team rumble is all about online multiplayer.
7364560	7368320	Unlike final fantasy 16, as some of those other games, they don't rely on multiplayer
7368320	7369280	crash team rumble.
7369280	7375760	It is that so attracting an online viewership that can help bolster the game anyway.
7375760	7382880	Um, so it's, um, it's struggling a little bit to get noticed and break through, which
7382880	7390400	means, Hmm, I wonder if, uh, it will be around much longer if it doesn't start to perform
7390400	7391040	better.
7391040	7395280	So I don't know what it's going to need, but I have to be honest, releasing the same week
7395280	7398480	as final fantasy 16 for me, not a good idea.
7398480	7402880	There was no way this game was going to hit my radar with that game out, but I also realized
7402880	7406320	not everybody's me, but it doesn't seem like, unfortunately, unless you're one of those
7406320	7409760	40 people, the game is really registering on your radar either.
7409760	7411680	Oh, all right.
7411680	7416160	And with that, that was the last scheduled story we had for tonight.
7416160	7418000	I do want to open up the listener round table.
7418000	7423520	If you have any, um, questions, comments, concerns, uh, or calls, you can always go
7423520	7425760	to our discord and speak with us through the week.
7425760	7428000	vognetwork.com slash discord.
7428000	7432320	And if you want to give us a call tonight, just join the green room channel, which is
7432320	7436960	over there, uh, under the, uh, uh, general channels.
7437920	7438560	No, just kidding.
7438560	7439280	I don't know what I'm talking about.
7439280	7440320	It's in the network show channels.
7440320	7441120	You'll see the green room.
7441120	7446400	You join that and you can, uh, be waiting to call in vognetwork.com slash discord.
7446400	7449200	Um, a few things.
7449200	7452640	I actually have a last minute headline tonight because I forgot to read it earlier in the
7452640	7457360	show when I was talking about BlizzCon, but I wanted to mention this is coming.
7458000	7464880	World of Warcraft classic hardcore is about to be officially embraced by Blizzard, meaning
7465520	7467200	death equals delete.
7467200	7468880	That's what hardcore is to be fair.
7468880	7471600	Hardcore is a thing that exists in Diablo.
7471600	7477360	So the concept of existing in World of Warcraft as well is not exactly farfetched considering
7477360	7481120	some feel that World of Warcraft plays more like Diablo than it does the original Warcraft,
7481120	7482080	to be quite honest.
7482080	7483920	But, uh, I digress.
7484560	7489920	World of Warcraft classic hardcore is going to be officially implementing this concept,
7489920	7494080	which means if you die, you don't get to go to a ghost and go back to life.
7494080	7497360	You cannot be resurrected with ancestral spirit.
7497920	7501520	You can also not use the warlock soul soul stone.
7501520	7506000	So I don't know, like this is like those moves kind of exist for those, but anyway,
7506000	7507520	that's how they're drawing the rules.
7507520	7509120	That's going to be very hard.
7509120	7515440	Um, your character will not disappear when they die, but they will be a ghost.
7515440	7517440	So you can stay in touch with your guild mates.
7517440	7521200	You can literally haunt your guild mates as a ghost.
7522560	7524960	But you can also, uh, what's interesting about this too.
7524960	7528720	You can do free transfers to non hardcore servers.
7528720	7530320	I like that a lot.
7530320	7533440	So if you are playing hardcore and you get really attached to the character and then
7533440	7536240	your character dies like randomly, cause that's always the way it goes.
7536240	7537760	It's like, Oh fuck, a lag spike.
7537760	7538240	I'm dead.
7538720	7542800	You can actually move that character to a non hardcore server and continue it.
7542800	7543520	That's cool.
7544000	7544960	Um, I like that.
7544960	7548080	That's very similar to what path of exile does with their hardcore mode.
7548080	7551360	Um, anyway, there will be other restrictions.
7552640	7556160	Um, not available in regular world of Warcraft.
7556160	7561200	You cannot kite a monster from one area to another to try to get it to attack low level
7561200	7561760	characters.
7562560	7562800	Good.
7563440	7568960	You cannot deliberately flag yourself for PVP before you can attack another player.
7568960	7572400	So they're trying to, um, stop that from happening.
7572400	7574400	Also, they're annoying shit back in the day.
7574400	7579280	They're also going to be de-emphasizing PVP in classic hardcore altogether.
7579280	7584160	You cannot queue for battlegrounds, but there will be a dueling mechanic.
7584160	7585520	If you're feeling so bold.
7586960	7591680	If you slay an opposing player, you get a cosmetic buff called string of ears.
7591680	7595360	They tracks the number of players that you have successfully tracked down.
7596000	7598080	That sounds very, uh, like the clown.
7598080	7598400	Yeah.
7598400	7600560	Very with his finger team.
7601200	7601700	Anyway.
7602480	7604720	Or the Teramisu cake with all the fingers around it.
7604720	7605220	Anyway.
7605600	7606800	Someone made one.
7606800	7608400	I saw that it was wild.
7608400	7611280	If you want to test that it is on the PTRs now.
7611280	7612720	So that could be very interesting.
7612720	7616960	Break Man in chat says haunting your friends sounds fun for about five seconds.
7616960	7617460	Yeah.
7618000	7618400	I don't know.
7619040	7622000	I've played hardcore in Diablo and it's fine.
7622000	7624720	I'm not at the mercy of other players, but of course, World of Warcraft, I just would
7624720	7626320	never turn on PVP mode.
7626320	7627840	That sounds completely uninteresting to me.
7628880	7633440	But I have done hardcore runs in Diablo and it is a little, I find that I play the game
7633440	7634800	much more conservatively.
7634800	7636720	Like I do not push difficulty.
7636720	7641680	I stay on baby and I just grind, grind, grind, grind, grind to get to like max level.
7641680	7644240	Cause at some point I'm going to do it in Diablo four.
7644240	7647040	I'm probably just waiting for seasonal play to do it.
7647040	7650080	It makes a little more sense to me to do a hardcore character then, because I think
7650080	7652800	it'll be high risk, high reward in seasonal play.
7653680	7655120	So I'll try it then.
7655120	7658160	But I don't think, I think we're getting the date for the first season next week.
7658160	7662320	It'll probably, it's, I can tell you when that first season is going to start.
7662320	7664880	It's going to start the last weekend in July.
7664880	7666800	How do I know it's going to start that weekend?
7666800	7668240	I'm going out of town.
7668240	7669920	That's why it's going to start that weekend.
7673280	7674240	You know what, Rob?
7674240	7674880	What's that?
7674880	7678080	I kind of miss us playing like wow together back in the day.
7678080	7679280	I miss wow too.
7679280	7684000	I miss your character, Rebecca black, especially when she was, she headlined pride here in
7684000	7685920	SAC a few weeks ago.
7685920	7687920	I was telling people about Rebecca black.
7687920	7689680	And her new music is pretty dope.
7689680	7690240	Actually.
7690240	7692080	She's in her mid twenties now, believe it.
7692080	7696640	It's like, I was reading a story on the John and Kate plus eight kids.
7696640	7698800	You know, those kids are 19.
7698800	7699520	They're adults.
7700480	7701040	Yeah.
7701040	7704560	God, when did, when did, when did age happen?
7705200	7708720	Anyway, um, every day, every second.
7709360	7712640	I, by the way, I had a birthday this last week and I forgot to talk about that.
7712640	7714640	I did a birthday stream because there's some birthdays.
7714640	7717360	There's some, I actually played some, a few things.
7717360	7719840	I played, um, no man's sky as well.
7719840	7725040	The first, um, I hadn't played the new expedition in that game and I cleared the first set on
7725040	7725360	stream.
7725360	7727120	It took me like maybe two hours.
7727120	7728320	I kind of rotated games.
7728320	7731680	I did like, I think I did theater them for two hours.
7731680	7732080	I did.
7732080	7733280	I did it by daylight at the end.
7733280	7735200	Cause Alan came on and play with me for two hours.
7735760	7737440	Um, play with me too.
7737440	7739280	We had such shit killers.
7739280	7741440	This event is bringing out the worst in people.
7741440	7742240	It's so wild.
7742240	7745600	Well, it's actually been 50 50 for me kind of.
7745600	7747840	Either they're like, that night was not fun.
7748720	7754320	Either they're the ultimate in sweat or they're like really cool and want to farm because
7754320	7755920	Hey, five cakes.
7755920	7756160	Yeah.
7756160	7756640	You know?
7756640	7756880	Yeah.
7757680	7758400	That's what I miss.
7759120	7765440	I miss in these events when the killer would just be standing in the middle, hitting the
7765440	7770080	palette over and over again or whatever, hitting an object in the train to, to signal that
7770080	7772320	like, come get hit, come get hit by the killer.
7772320	7772880	Let's farm.
7772880	7774160	I haven't seen a single one of those.
7774880	7780160	This whole, we've had, we've had a few off and on, um, mostly it's been like, like we'll
7780160	7782720	every so often, like I've had a fun Sadako.
7782720	7786960	Like the thing is, is that one thing to remember is that I play with Shayla.
7787760	7788320	Oh yeah.
7788320	7789440	Who is the killer whisperer?
7789440	7790000	That's true.
7791440	7792800	Chaela is the killer watch.
7792800	7793040	Yeah.
7793040	7798560	Although I'm, I'm not bad at it, but, but like, I, and, and actually I think I got one
7798560	7799680	person who knows me.
7800800	7804640	So actually I did, it was somebody who was on my friends list.
7804640	7812960	It was, uh, uh, like, uh, Meg loves Anna and I was playing my Meg and they were playing
7812960	7815760	the huntress and I was the chosen Meg.
7817200	7818000	Not a single hit.
7819520	7822960	And then when I realized it was my friend after I was like, Oh my God, it was my friend.
7822960	7823920	That was cool.
7823920	7826160	That's only ever happened to me once.
7826160	7827200	It wasn't the killer though.
7827200	7828240	It was another survivor.
7828240	7829120	I queued up.
7829120	7830640	It was probably about a year ago.
7830640	7836400	I went into solo queue and I had Kate with one perk because I was trying to level Kate
7836400	7837360	Denson for whatever reason.
7837360	7838480	I was just trying to prestige.
7838480	7842400	And of course who, who, who ends up in my lobby has lands.
7842400	7845520	Now how the fuck am I, was I in the same?
7846480	7850240	I guess that's how, you know, I was like MMR is broken.
7850240	7852240	Cause there's no way I should be in the same survivor.
7852240	7853520	MMR has lands.
7853520	7854400	Absolutely not.
7854400	7859920	Unless he had some sweaty killers back to back to back that like dropped him significantly.
7859920	7860960	But that made me giggle.
7860960	7863440	I was like, Oh, that's fucking random.
7863440	7867120	So yeah, I've had cam in my lobby before his killer.
7867840	7868800	That's wild.
7868800	7868960	Yeah.
7868960	7870880	And I've had a few other people.
7870880	7871680	I've seen that happen.
7871680	7875280	Like I've seen people playing and then, um, they go actually.
7875280	7878640	Was it has playing once when losing color was the, I mean, that's, this shows you how
7878640	7879280	long ago it was.
7879280	7882240	Cause losing color has been a little bit in the retirement home for a little bit from
7882240	7885920	DVD, but, uh, they were the killer for one of the games just randomly.
7885920	7886480	I want to say.
7887120	7893920	I, I still was always like, I always wanted to get LC as nurse and I, and every nurse
7893920	7895040	game I'd be like, what are they wearing?
7896720	7898960	Is it combo nurse with the Rose thing?
7900160	7900800	So yeah.
7900800	7901300	Yeah.
7902560	7904000	Anyway, uh, let's see.
7904000	7907040	Uh, I wanted to check in on any other final thoughts.
7907040	7909040	I have a question for, for folks.
7909040	7911840	If, uh, nobody's gonna drop any in chat, but, uh,
7911840	7913440	Yeah, we didn't get an email.
7913440	7916400	Loki, did you have any, uh, participate at orange on traded.com.
7916400	7920400	If you want to send an email, but I'm going to caution again.
7920400	7921760	I am at that fate again.
7921760	7922320	Here we are.
7923040	7925120	Here we are friends again.
7925120	7926960	I'm asking you to donate $20.
7926960	7927600	I'm so angry.
7927600	7928160	No, I'm just kidding.
7928160	7933200	Let me pictures of your cats, but we have an empty mailbag and when we have an empty
7933200	7937200	mailbag for six weeks in a row, I start to go, should we have a mailbag segment?
7937200	7938080	So anyway, yes.
7938640	7939140	All right.
7939760	7944960	It's the communicate with orange lounge segment, whether it's, so it's all encompassing.
7944960	7948320	I know we send me pictures of your animals.
7949040	7953040	Uh, Loki, do you have any, uh, last minute stories before we, uh, think about wrapping
7953040	7953540	it up?
7953840	7960560	Um, yeah, based off of, uh, a job listing posted by EA, it is rumored that the next
7960560	7966640	Sims entry will be free to play, which makes sense because they already monetize it.
7966640	7968160	Like it's a free to play game anyways.
7968160	7971920	It just wouldn't be charging upfront costs anyways for it, which is kind of what they're
7971920	7976160	doing now with Sims four anyways, because the base game is free to play and they probably
7976160	7977840	have success with that.
7977840	7982160	But yeah, it's, it's already microtransaction that, you know, the wazoos.
7982160	7983920	So why not?
7985600	7988800	I can't, it'll be a big marketing thing for them.
7988800	7989360	It's free.
7989920	7990420	Yeah.
7991040	7992080	I can see them doing that.
7992080	7993840	Absolutely free asterisks.
7995440	7995940	So.
7996960	8002240	Randomly this week, I had to get the tire on my car replay or patched basically, because
8002240	8007760	unfortunately, um, I ran over not one, but two nails somehow, or they were placed in
8007760	8011440	my tire, but I don't know how that happens, but anyway, luckily it was patchable.
8011440	8015120	And the cool thing is a lot of tired, like they'll just do it for free because they want
8015120	8015760	your business.
8015760	8020480	And I went to the place I always go to anyway, but here's the thing across the street.
8020560	8022080	From the place was a Walmart.
8022080	8025280	I don't usually go into Walmarts, but I'd had time to kill.
8025280	8027760	So I went in and you know what Walmart sells.
8027760	8029600	They sell arcade one up machines.
8030480	8033440	And you know, when I look at another one, when I look, no, I did not buy another one.
8033440	8038320	But when I look behind me here, you're going to notice I have this, I have one machine,
8039120	8044560	two machine, and they have this interesting blank space before we get to the third or
8044560	8046400	before, excuse me, before I get to the couch.
8046400	8050240	So I have this perfectly sized space for a third machine.
8050240	8057440	And I will say I saw a Ms. Pac-Man arcade one up that connects to the internet.
8057440	8059120	It's like a newer version of it.
8059120	8062480	And it has all the cool Namco games like Mappy and shit connects to the internet.
8062480	8065360	But I got to say that one looked really good and I was tempted by that one.
8065360	8069760	But then I saw like three down from it was a mortal combat one that's new.
8069760	8071520	And it's the first three mortal combat games.
8071520	8072480	But here's the thing.
8073200	8078000	A lot of the arcade one up machines also include libraries of games from the same publisher.
8078000	8084800	And that means it has the Midway classics like bubbles, joust, robotron, like that machine
8084800	8086240	is fucking stacked.
8086960	8089840	And it's Wi Fi compatible now in the new one.
8089840	8096400	And so I texted Alan a picture and I said, Alan, tell me not to do it.
8096400	8098160	And he just basically replied to lol.
8098160	8104160	The only reason I didn't get it was because at that point, two reasons.
8104160	8108240	One, I knew that I may have to get my tire replaced.
8108240	8110000	And that would have cost me $150.
8110000	8111520	That's like half a machine right there.
8111520	8115200	So I was like, I better not spend the money until I know if I need a tire or not.
8115200	8119520	And my husband and I went out for a belated birthday dinner.
8119520	8121520	We went out to a Brazilian steakhouse.
8121520	8123200	There's a new one in Roseville.
8123200	8123920	That's where we went.
8124880	8126480	Some chain that just showed up in Roseville.
8126480	8128160	We went there and it was fine.
8128160	8132720	But because I had a cocktail and a dessert because it's my birthday.
8132720	8136160	It was, you know, those Brazilian steakhouses, $200.
8136960	8139600	So that was my fancy birthday dinner.
8141600	8143680	And that was pretty much the cost of a machine.
8143680	8145360	So that stopped me from doing it.
8145360	8149520	But I guess my question to everybody is, should I have pulled?
8149520	8150880	Should I have got the damn machine?
8151680	8152180	Sure.
8152960	8153460	Yeah.
8154240	8156000	I think you still still should do it.
8156000	8156640	I might.
8156640	8157120	I might.
8157120	8162400	We're not the ink is not dry on that decision yet.
8162400	8162960	So we'll see.
8165840	8167440	And then bring it to my house.
8167440	8168640	And then bring it to your house.
8169280	8172160	You don't have any arcade one ups in your house, do you?
8172160	8174480	Because you only have the real things.
8174480	8175600	I have my two little ones.
8176720	8178160	Not like the size that you have.
8178160	8179440	Yeah, you have the little table.
8179440	8180560	Actually, I love those.
8180560	8181280	The tabletops.
8181280	8184560	I have yet to see one again since I saw him at Target a few years ago.
8185120	8191200	Well, actually, if we talk, I might be interested in selling my Dig Dug.
8191760	8192240	Okay.
8192240	8193760	Work because I like Dig Dug.
8193760	8194260	Okay.
8194640	8196160	It's a Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2.
8196160	8198720	Yeah, I have another one that's got Dig Dug on it.
8198720	8202240	So I didn't realize when I got it, but we already had Dig Dug.
8202240	8202560	Okay.
8202560	8202800	Yeah.
8202800	8203920	And Dig Dug 2 is not.
8204720	8206800	But it's a dedicated Dig Dug.
8206800	8209360	I'm actually pretty good at Dig Dug.
8210080	8213040	I don't mean to talk my game up, but I'm pretty good at Dig Dug.
8213040	8213760	All right.
8213760	8214320	We'll talk.
8214880	8218240	I got it pretty inexpensive when I got it.
8218240	8220720	And we'll talk.
8220720	8223280	SSG100Matt says Costco sells the tabletop ones.
8223280	8224320	Like only on their website.
8225680	8228080	Allen goes to the store every month and is always looking.
8228080	8232320	In fact, he saw an arcade one up at Costco once and was fucking teasing me with it.
8232320	8235760	It was a super Pac-Man with wood paneling.
8235760	8236260	What?
8236560	8237680	Yeah, at Costco.
8237680	8241200	This is, unfortunately, this was, I think, the year the pandemic started.
8241200	8242160	I think it was 2020.
8243120	8247120	And I was like, no, don't buy it because I don't know.
8247120	8249840	And now I've never seen an arcade one up there since.
8249840	8251040	And it was a super Pac-Man.
8253360	8255280	If only I had a baby Pac-Man.
8255840	8256960	I know, right?
8256960	8257440	Me too.
8257440	8258240	Me too.
8258240	8262240	I didn't even see one at Golden State, by the way.
8262240	8265200	They had the Got Lied Pac-Man.
8266000	8267360	They did not have a baby Pac-Man.
8267360	8270640	And I was beside myself for all of five seconds.
8271600	8275680	But I would love, I would love the tabletops because the tabletops will fit in my closet
8275680	8276240	much better.
8276240	8277600	Unfortunately, I was going to move.
8278240	8281040	The BurgerTime will fit in my closet.
8281040	8282880	The Tron will not.
8282880	8285440	You can see on stream, and I apologize to the podcast listeners.
8285440	8288720	You can see there's a height difference between Tron and BurgerTime.
8288720	8290960	And the closet is like right here.
8290960	8293280	So Tron wouldn't fit, but BurgerTime would.
8294800	8297760	But I've already had to talk to Allen about, I have a problem.
8297760	8299520	What happens if I get more of these machines?
8299520	8302240	But we might, if we had to, we might move them into our bedroom.
8302240	8304640	We have a wall in our bedroom that's not being used for anything.
8304640	8306160	It's just like empty.
8306160	8307680	So I'd probably move it in there.
8309920	8310640	All right.
8310640	8313440	Well, with that, I think we're going to move and wrap up the show.
8313440	8316160	But thank you as always for tuning in and listening to our show tonight.
8316160	8317040	We appreciate it.
8317040	8319680	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Songs Radio, please tell a friend.
8319680	8322720	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8322720	8324560	But we need more voices to put out here on air.
8324560	8325600	Tell a friend or two.
8325600	8329360	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is you found this
8330240	8331360	awful long way.
8331360	8331840	Guess what?
8331840	8335440	You won't find it on, I mean, you couldn't find it on Stitcher anyway, but guess what?
8335440	8336480	Stitcher's going under.
8337120	8342240	So sorry to everybody out there who used Stitcher, but our show hasn't been on it for years because
8342240	8346480	when I told them they needed to update our show, they said it was our problem.
8346480	8350080	And I pointed out that every other podcatcher out there didn't have a problem.
8350080	8353760	And they still said, I said, pull the feed.
8353760	8357120	I'm not going to have people emailing going, why haven't you updated the show in six weeks?
8357120	8358000	Pull the feed.
8358000	8360400	So we haven't been on Stitcher in a long time.
8360400	8364560	So I'm sorry to those that use that, but as far as far as I'm concerned, it's a win
8364560	8367360	because we were not compatible with that platform.
8367360	8370080	Anyway, to be fair, it was under a prior owner.
8370080	8371840	It was not under their current owners.
8371840	8375120	So I have, but you know, when you burn a bridge, it's hard to build back.
8375840	8376160	All right.
8377840	8379280	Anyway, I didn't mean to end on the name.
8379280	8382800	I say when, when bridges get burned, just shove people off the end.
8382800	8385920	Yeah, well, that's, well, that's kind of what happened here.
8385920	8386160	All right.
8386160	8389840	Anyway, uh, that is, uh, that is it.
8389840	8391760	Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
8391760	8392240	Dark soccer.
8392240	8393120	Your final thoughts tonight.
8393760	8399920	I am feeling kind of, uh, ill, but I am dedicated to breaking ankles tonight.
8400480	8402240	So we'll see what happens.
8402960	8403200	All right.
8403200	8404080	Have fun.
8404080	8406400	Oh, also I have, um, an interview for a position.
8406400	8408320	So everyone wish me luck luck.
8408320	8410720	Good luck later.
8410720	8410960	Later.
8410960	8411520	My taters.
8412240	8412880	All right.
8412880	8414240	Logie we're over to you.
8414240	8414960	Your final thought.
8414960	8421920	Um, my final thought is hopefully look forward to a new episode of my Minecraft series this
8421920	8422160	week.
8423360	8423680	Nice.
8425040	8429520	Um, my final thought is I have two more days off work and I'd really love to beat final
8429520	8430960	fantasy 16.
8430960	8434800	I off stream caught up on all my side quests, so I'm ready.
8434800	8438800	I'm hoping we don't have, um, too much further to go, but we'll see.
8438800	8440960	Actually, but at the same time, it's like, I kind of don't want it to end.
8440960	8442080	It's really good.
8442080	8445600	Um, but yeah, I'm hoping maybe in the next couple of days I will finally beat Final Fantasy
8445600	8448000	16 and then I can, uh, surf the internet.
8448000	8450640	Uh, spoiler worry concern.
8450640	8454400	I feel like I've hit most of the big spoilers at this point, but we'll see.
8454400	8456480	I mean, there's, there could always be more to come.
8456480	8459920	So, um, yeah, I'm looking forward to beating Final Fantasy 16.
8460480	8461200	That's it.
