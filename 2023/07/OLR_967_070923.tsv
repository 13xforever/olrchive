0	15880	The action in play-to-earn games is boring. What's the point if the games are no fun?
15880	19260	I agree with this entirely for myself, but fun means different things to different people.
19260	23380	Like the recent news about how over 1 million players play exclusively Call of Duty releases.
23380	26980	But we agree that interactive blockchain grinds are dying before they're even out of the gate.
27540	31140	This is the ultra-narrow opening headline intro. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,
31140	33700	Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you the source of this quote and the rest of the
33700	36820	week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38740	43700	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
43700	52820	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 967
52820	61060	of our program for tonight, July 9th, 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined live
61060	66740	on this lovely Sunday evening as I am quite often over the last 21 years with my co-hosts.
66740	71220	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I'm on a recruitment drive.
71220	75220	On a recruitment drive. Are you recruiting for your cult that involves lambs?
75220	79220	No, for one more follow-up. Oh, yes, of course. Here at the VOG.
79220	82500	One more person. That's right. It would be a lovely
82500	88180	hurdle to cross to get 500 followers here. Well, I guess it's a good opportunity for me to plug
88180	92340	that we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific
92340	98820	at the Voice of Geeks network at twitch.tv, VOG network on Twitch. And if you'd follow,
98820	103780	we would super appreciate that. We are on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, typically,
103780	108420	but unfortunately Bobby was not on tonight again. He wasn't on last week as he was
109300	113860	doing other things. But tonight, unfortunately, he's under the weather. He might be lurking in
113860	121300	chat, but yeah, feel better soon, Bobby. Sorry to hear that. That's always the most terrible way to
121300	128500	end a trip is to get sick. He said it's not the big one, but you know, everything else is floating
128500	133700	around out there these days. I mean, I say this as somebody who had strep for a month, basically,
133700	139300	and just got over that. So it's always something. Well, it's always Techmaster Loki.
141140	147860	Oh, yeah, right. Well, hey, Loki, how are you? Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah, good deal. I noticed
147860	152900	in your background tonight, you still have et going in. I haven't I haven't updated the video
152900	157220	yet. That's fine. That's it. It'll be a new video. It reminds me I need to try that game already.
157220	162420	It's very fun. I played it. I played it a little bit this week. Yeah. Yeah. It's just an itch.io
162420	166420	thing, right? It's not like Yeah, it's completely free. It's a unity game. So you can actually
166420	173300	download it or stream it from itch.io. And it's, you know, it's fun. It's a good time waster.
173300	178660	Yeah, yeah. No, I the vampire survivors and all the clones are a lot of fun. Like there was one
178660	183540	called like Soulstone survivors I played there was there was another there's there's several of them
183540	187620	out there now. It's like a whole new genre of games. Most of them are pretty fun. I mean,
188180	195940	as with many genres, there are always cheap knockoffs as well. But that that is pretty good,
195940	204500	for what it's worth. So did you change it? Just Yes, you change. I told you I was changing it.
204500	209460	Fine. So what are we looking at now? Gravity Circuit. It's a game coming out,
209460	214260	I think this week, actually. What's is this? Like, I'm getting Megaman vibes just off the
214420	220340	splash. Yeah, it's a little bit it's kind of got that Megaman vibe to it. It's not exactly
220340	226580	like Megaman. It's like a brawler. But it's also a little bit Megaman a little bit like
227300	232100	metal slug. I don't know. It's pretty cool looking, though. I was gonna say Megaman did
232100	237860	have those the power battle arcade games that I feel like were relatively rare, but then they
237860	242740	would show up on these collections. It's Yeah, it's more like I would say, I guess maybe like
242740	246900	Shovel Knight a little bit, you know, whereas they don't. The main character doesn't have
246900	250420	like a projectile. It's more of just brawling the enemies. But it's still,
251060	255540	you know, a little bit of Ninja Gaiden in there as well. Okay. Yeah, it looks cool.
255540	259140	All right. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's definitely giving me more like Ninja Gaiden vibes than
259140	266260	Megaman. But yes, it's very fast. Ninja Gaiden's play style with Megaman's graphics.
267220	273220	It's sort of Yeah, sort of. All right. We've got some video game news to cover as we often do here
273220	279940	on the program. And then of course, the things you all have to say over on our Twitch chat channel.
279940	285460	Again, twitch.tv slash vog network as we are live on Sunday nights, dark to see us starting us off
285460	290020	with a follow up to something I was just saying, saying I'm surprised the power battle stuff hasn't
290020	295300	been re released recently. With all the Megaman love the digital clips is giving from them is
295380	299140	giving them lately. Well, it's I thought it was part of one of them. I thought it
299140	304340	didn't come out recently, too. But I was in one of the collections recently to me could be like
304340	309220	10 years ago, to be quite honest. I but I do think I feel like they were in one of those Megaman
309220	314580	collections that came out not long ago. I'm pretty sure they were break man says Capcom collection
314580	319540	too. It's Yeah, I was gonna say I knew it was in one of them because they even I think they did
319540	326420	the soccer game as well. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah, there was like a whole like Megaman collection
326420	332420	thing that had come out relatively recently. I always forget about the arcade stadium
332420	337780	collection too. And you know, Capcom does a really good job I think of embracing a lot of their retro
337780	343060	library. Well, we just talked about like not even two weeks ago on the show they were they launched
343060	347780	like an anniversary website and you could actually play just right in your browser. The original
347780	353300	Megaman or you could load up the Rockman Japanese ROM, you can see how much different Rockman two is
353300	357220	difficulty wise for what we got as Megaman two, you know, things like that. It's all
358180	365060	on the web, you can just fire it up. So pretty cool. So all right. But let's talk about what's
365060	371140	going on in gaming a little less Capcom to start us off and a little more Sega, but maybe maybe of
371140	377620	a classic era Loki. Yeah, it's not necessarily so when you hear like, you know, leaks coming from
378500	383620	a company, you may think, Oh, my goodness, you know, what, what can we find out? Well, not much, because
383620	391300	this happened. These are documents from the 90s. So like, it's, it's been a while. So there were some
391300	399460	documents that were leaked out from Sega. These included everything from like, financial statements
399460	408420	to emails, you know, from internally within Sega, some stuff talking about the Sega Saturn versus
408420	413620	Sony PlayStation, that type of stuff. Nothing really like super interesting. I mean, aside outside
413620	418100	of like, kind of fascination, there's nothing really like, oh, there was there was a game we
418100	422900	didn't know about or something like that. Well, wasn't there like a vector man three or something
422900	428420	I think was Yeah, they talked about that a while back. But like, I don't know if that was actually
428420	435140	ever that ever came out. Nothing like substantial. Like it's not like we're getting an entire ROM of
435140	440180	an unreleased. You know, it's it's no it's like marketing strategy. Maybe for different things.
441780	449300	pitches. Yeah. Yeah. So that's all on Sega Sega retro. If you want to check out some of the stuff
449300	456900	that's in there. Yeah, it's just, I don't know. It's a downloadable PDF. Yeah, it looks interesting.
456900	462020	I mean, but a lot of it is just like marketing stuff. Like, for example, they have one right
462020	469380	here. April 1 1996. The subject is the Saturn airport storyboard. And then they have like,
469380	474020	a few concerns. And it's just like talking about things that they want to change on the marketing.
474820	478100	I think it's it's this is one of those things. Like if you're a retro enthusiast,
478100	483620	enthusiast, enthusiast, it's a very unique kind of peek behind the curtain. And I know,
483620	486980	you know, we talk about leaks and stuff, it's always a little bit of a slippery slope, because
486980	491220	some of this stuff is, you know, a little bit shady, sometimes in the way it's obtained.
491860	497860	This is, you know, 30 to 25 30 year old stuff, you know, coming from a company that isn't actively
497860	501060	making any of these products anymore. I mean, yes, they're still in gaming, but they're not in
501060	507300	hardware. So I think it this is more for, you know, archivists. And, you know, folks that are
507300	512740	really enthusiastic about retro gaming. I mean, I believe there was some books being written not that
512740	519140	long ago about the Nintendo versus Sega wars. And I want to say they had option a movie or
519140	522580	something like I want to say that's why that that topic had come up not that long ago is that they
522580	527460	were looking at doing like a movie or something. So if you are kind of like fascinated by that era,
527460	531700	I think this is something that's like, oh, this is really neat, because it's a really
531700	536900	interesting peek behind the curtain as to you know, where might things have gone wrong for
536900	541060	Sega? I mean, I'm sure everybody's kind of formed some opinions, but, you know, kind of gives a
541060	545220	little more substance substance to that about like, okay, what what worse of the decision
545220	549620	being made? Where were some of the hang ups? So it's, it's interesting. But I think that's about
549620	556340	as far as it goes. It's interesting. It read it slash mildly interesting. Is that for me?
556340	562660	Kind of Yeah, it's it's interesting. There's a lot of just reports in here. A lot of mainframe
562660	568740	reports, which I mean, that's your thing. There you go.
568740	574020	Mainframe reports. Golly, there's this guy, Rob Roberts, who calls in on his Dreamcast all the
574020	579220	time playing Phantasy Star Online. Wow, that's loading up the mainframe. It's kind of cool. They
579220	585860	got like, they have storyboards for commercials on here as well. So that's kind of fun. And,
585860	591940	you know, the commercials of that era were really unique, right? We all remember, like,
591940	600180	Sega does what Nintendon't. And it was this very, like, it's so cringe to go back now and look at
600180	608260	how can we attract 90s youth? How can we attract Gen X with these, you know, advertisements?
608260	613380	And even with that, like one of the notations that they had in one of the emails that was on there
613380	618900	that was showcased was that, you know, Nintendo is going to come out and they're going to market
618900	625780	their Nintendo 64 as the ultimate gaming machine. We have to get in front of that. And basically,
625780	630180	like, we have to call ours the ultimate gaming machine first, so they can't do it. You know,
630180	636820	it's kind of funny. Yeah. Breakman in chat over at Twitch TV VOG Network says,
636820	641700	I remember the stupid school arguments over which system was better. The fact is, we all wished our
641700	646500	parents could afford both systems. You know, what's interesting, though, some things never
646500	652900	change. I mean, I feel like on social media, certain areas, you still see a lot of the
652900	659300	PlayStation versus Xbox. But it's interesting, because I don't feel the same sort of approach
659300	664340	from the companies, right? We often see now a little more again, on social media, you'll see
664340	671860	things like, you know, Microsoft or Phil Spencer openly congratulating Nintendo or even PlayStation
671860	677700	on the release of a major product, you see interesting things like, you know, cross
678260	684660	platform, online play, right? Like, I know, we don't talk a lot about sports games on this show.
684660	690820	So I know it's not on our show roll, but I'm aware that NBA 2k 24 is that what it's called
690820	696820	the new the new NBA 2024 was recently announced, it's coming out in September, and they're talking
696820	703380	about cross platform play on it, which, you know, is something that if that was even available in
703380	707300	the 90s, obviously, the technologies changed a lot, that would have never happened the way
707300	713380	the companies were in the 90s. You know what I mean? Yeah. So it even though I think the console
713380	718420	war still exists to an extent, I think it's really driven by this audience who just like,
718420	725140	feels the need to be on a winning team. Or something. I don't know. Sometimes I
725140	731140	yeah, it's the team mentality. Or it's like, it's almost goes back to a lot of people that
731140	737380	are really into like high school football. Yeah, high school sports. It's like, they're very much
737380	742900	like, I like our team has to win. It like goes in the politics. It goes into everything. It's like,
742900	747220	I see youtubers that get really into this. And I understand part of it is probably
747220	750900	click driven. It's sensational. It's click driven, but I can't help but kind of like roll
750900	758260	my eyes at some of it. And it's because I'm just kind of like, I like grow up like it just like to
758260	764020	me, like some of that just kind of shows a lot. I maybe I'm being really rude, but I it shows a
764020	771220	lack of critical thinking. I feel like when you get really, really into how to think those console
771220	775380	wars that you can't you're like unable to see things from the other side. I don't know. I just
776340	780980	think of some things that I see sometimes and it's people that I know too. And I'm just kind
780980	787060	of like, it's kind of a human thing. Yeah, people like like two things. Number one,
788020	793940	things that reinforce their own core beliefs. And number two, echo chambers. Yeah, yeah. Well,
793940	800100	yeah. I mean, God, look at look at what social media is huge on those. Absolutely. That's even
800100	803940	beyond the console wars. But yes, the thing is that they assume other people are like that.
805540	810500	And it's funny when you're not a person who's like that, then people don't know what to think
810500	816260	about you. Like when I was a kid, I kinda you know, I played everything I could get my hands
816260	820820	on. I didn't really I mean, I love my Super Nintendo more because I love the games on it
820820	824420	more. But I certainly like to sit down with some sonic action, you know.
827220	832020	Comment from chat Zen monkey 11 says I kept up with both systems through the 80s 90s,
832020	837700	odds, etc. Some systems ran games a lot better than others. So console wars is needed to help
837700	842900	people make the right choice for themselves. I'm not saying you can't like sit there and say
842900	849380	evaluate PlayStation, evaluate Microsoft, evaluate Nintendo, evaluate their offerings and see what's
849380	854980	the right choice for you. And there was something about the marketing in the 80s and 90s that really
854980	860100	encouraged all those sorts of fanboy wars and the things that we're seeing. And my point is,
860340	865140	it's okay to sit there and say, okay, now that I've kind of evaluated this and what you're
865140	869540	talking about, like the graphics and what runs better, or I think a lot in this day and age where
869540	874740	the first party exclusives are or weighing something like game pass versus God of War,
874740	879380	Last of Us, etc, etc. Nintendo exclusives, portability, all that once you weigh all of
879380	886580	those and you decide this is the right system for me. That's great. That's that's much different
886580	894820	than the fanboy wars. The fanboy wars I'm talking about are PlayStation is the right console for me
894820	901460	and for everybody else. And if you don't agree with me, you're wrong for the following reasons,
901460	905060	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's the difference. Yeah.
905060	909380	Game of ticks. Oh my god. Perfect. Perfect.
909380	915540	Copyright Jamie 2023. You steal my word. I kick you in the shin.
915540	919620	No, no, but monetize it. Trademark it. Patent pending. Put it on a shirt.
921540	923220	Game of ticks. I'm over it.
923220	923940	Game of ticks.
925220	929860	By the way, I don't usually shout these out live on the show. But because it is a special occasion,
929860	934660	I do want to say a special shout out to our 500th follower Rob Way. Thank you. Congratulations.
937380	942900	Thank you. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Breakman says I don't have a PlayStation five because I
942900	947380	don't have all the free time in the world. Not because I hate PlayStation. That's like, again,
947380	951300	you have to, I know a lot of people that are really upset because they want to play Final
951300	956180	Fantasy 16. But it's like the PlayStation five. It's like, I don't want to spend the money on,
956180	962980	and I completely understand that. PlayStation fives aren't cheap. Like, yes, I completely
962980	970340	recognize I have the privilege of the job that I have and the income that I have and that I am in
970340	975540	a double income, no kid household. And that affords me certain luxuries like being able to buy
975540	979860	a PlayStation, you know, save up and you know, everything else. I can't buy everything I want
979860	984900	in this world. Like I didn't go get a VR two as well. If I had limitless income, I probably would.
984900	990900	But I do recognize I'm able to do that. And not everybody else can. And that that's something else
990900	995620	to get in these family wars. I could get a PS five or I could get weird Al pinball.
995620	998100	Right.
998900	1001540	Or money toward weird Al.
1002500	1005220	You know, so I'm reminded
1005220	1008580	All the money I spent on I had to rebuy all my Dead by Daylight DLC.
1009780	1013620	To put a pin in this a little bit and move on to the other part of the Sega story I want to talk
1013620	1019220	about. But I'm reminded of and it was several years ago and I want to say and I don't know if
1019220	1023460	I'm crediting the wrong person for this comment. So I'm sorry, but memory, it's the first thing to
1023460	1029540	go. Or actually, the joke is memory is the second thing to go. What's the first thing? Get it. So
1030900	1036340	I believe it was no one special 77. In the early days of listening to this show said,
1036340	1041060	Well, I don't know if I really count as a gamer, because I just have an N 64. And I play a lot of
1041060	1048180	games on the N 64. Because that's all I'm able to afford. And I believe our response was a resounding
1048980	1053860	Yeah, you're still a gamer. You're 100% a gamer. You're just as much of a gamer as anyone else
1053860	1059780	here at the table. Like you're playing video games, are you not on a pretty incredible system, right?
1059780	1065940	Like, just because you're not with the latest and greatest and the coolest technology. I mean,
1065940	1072420	the awesome thing about how far this industry has come in 30 years is that there are a metric
1072420	1079380	fuck ton of amazing retro classics for you to go revisit. And that's why preservation is so
1079380	1084340	important, right? And why we, you know, can't stand to see games like disappear or become
1084340	1088820	inaccessible at a certain point. Thankfully, most of the cartridge games that we kind of think of
1088820	1093860	when we think of 80s and 90s, and even early CD ROM things don't have this problem. But like,
1093860	1098660	you know, like, look at the game that Loki's got playing in his background. It makes you think,
1098660	1106100	oh, man, going back and playing Megaman, Ninja Gaiden, like those, those are amazing classics
1106100	1111140	that are worth revisiting always and always, right? So it doesn't make you any less of a gamer
1111140	1116820	if you're not able to play Final Fantasy 16 right now, because you can't drop 500 plus another 70
1116820	1125220	bucks on the investment that it takes. So anyway, um, other comments in chat. Tiger class says the
1125220	1129700	issue with getting a PS five is it's not backwards compatible with the PS four games. So my head
1129700	1134260	games on the PS four, you haven't gotten around to playing camp. That's not true. It is actually
1134260	1139220	backwards compatible with PS four, you might be thinking of PS four and PS three. But I mean,
1139220	1144740	where you might be is if you get the digital only one, then obviously you can't put a disk in that.
1144740	1151780	But you can put a PS four disk in a disk enabled PS five and it will work. It actually is backwards
1151860	1155380	compatible. So just, just a heads up. But I realized, you know, again, with a lot going
1155380	1161620	digital, it kind of, you know, changes things and all that stuff. So anyway, dark to see, I think
1161620	1166580	my memory is actually right, because he also remembers that and I trust dark to see his memory
1166580	1172180	of this show better, better than my own, quite frankly. So um, and another interesting comment
1172180	1177540	from sj 100. Matt, who says I want a PS five now, I didn't before because there weren't enough games
1177540	1182100	for me to justify the separate purchase. Now there are but I don't have enough time to play.
1182100	1186500	And I think that's also totally okay. Like you don't have to get a new system day one. I didn't
1186500	1192900	get a PS five day one. I got a PS five when I finally was like, okay, yep, Final Fantasy 16
1192900	1198340	is coming. And there's these other games I want to play, including theater them a PS four game,
1198340	1203380	going back to what I had said earlier, and some of these other just, you know, other things on PS
1203380	1207940	five, like returnal and other things that like now there's enough games where I want to pick
1207940	1213060	one up and do that, but I didn't buy one day one. They were also impossible to find day one,
1213060	1219860	but that's another argument. All right, anyhow, let's move on. I there's another side of this
1219860	1226420	whole Sega thing in the more recent element, right? Yeah. Yeah. So a bit of a relief, actually.
1226420	1234980	So the you may remember Sega was gonna, you know, invest some of their money, I assume,
1234980	1242500	and time into getting into the NFT business. But they have decided that no, they're not going to
1242500	1249060	do that. Instead, they according to the chief operating officer, they're going to be withholding
1249060	1255300	its biggest franchise from third party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content
1255300	1261860	also be shelving plans to develop their own games in that genre for at least now. So we're looking
1261860	1267460	into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry. After all, the
1268420	1273220	basically having concerns, you know, at least right now they're saying that their biggest
1273220	1281060	franchises are off the table. Also, they were saying that the action in play to earn games
1281060	1287060	is boring. What's the point of games if they're no fun? I mean, yeah, exactly.
1287700	1292100	It sounds like some wise decisions are being made at Sega right now. So keep up the good work. I
1292100	1296900	mean, they probably just see the market tanking. So they're like, yeah, you know, not only can we
1296900	1301860	not invest in this market that's not really thriving, but we can also get some more,
1302980	1308820	you know, some value with our, our fans to let them know, hey, we're not going to touch that
1308820	1312740	trash, even though we said we're going to touch that trash. Well, I think it also kind of puts
1312740	1320180	a pin on exactly what a flash in the pan or to be flash in the pan. This whole NFT stuff was
1320180	1324580	because like, you know, one day everybody's like, Oh, this is gonna be the next big thing. And now
1324580	1329380	what has been like, not even eight months. And everybody's like, nevermind. Nevermind.
1329380	1334500	Well, that's the thing about the specular market. Whoops, bad call, abort, abort.
1335300	1337780	It's hard to speculate when it's crashing. Yeah.
1340420	1347140	So, I mean, but I can't think that many of us were fans of the whole NFT thing to begin with.
1347140	1352660	So, you know, it's one of those like, no love lost here. So I'm glad they figured it out before they
1352660	1358420	had a real stinker of a game come out or something like that, you know, I think, yeah.
1359060	1365460	That's that. All right. Well, good. I hope for the best out of Sega for the future. You know,
1365460	1369540	it sounds like they've got some exciting revivals potentially in the works. I mean, nothing
1369540	1375460	officially confirmed. But you know, those rumors about crazy taxi and jet set radio and also like,
1375460	1382740	they won't go away. So who knows? Maybe someday, maybe someday. All right. Well, in the meantime,
1382740	1387140	let's talk about some of the games that we have been playing this week, whether they be classics
1387140	1391700	or new shiny things in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week? So DarkSakura,
1391700	1402500	how was your gaming week? It was. It just was. I did, of course, Dead by Daylight. I got
1403060	1411220	at least all of the cosmetics from the Rift or whatever the new Rift-y thing is, whatever it's
1411220	1421940	called. So, yeah, that's done. I did Midnight Suns. I did Cult of the Lamb. I played some
1421940	1432420	Black Knight 3000. I played some World Cup Soccer. Yeah. I've mostly been working on like Vtuber
1432420	1440740	stuff. I've been fighting with trying to get a model that I made in Daz 3D, which I've gotten
1440740	1449460	into Blender just fine. But then it's getting it to export with its textures and then getting the
1450500	1458900	rig to stick to the mesh when I do the export. So I just need somebody who is better at that
1458900	1465700	than I am to compile it for me. I've played with it for days and it's a pain in the ass and I think
1465700	1471460	I have to do it through Unity or some shit. And I have Unity. I haven't touched it. So I'm just
1471460	1481700	going to stick with the... I'm trying to make it as less YY anime waifu as I can, but she still
1481700	1486500	looks pretty anime waifu. And honestly, it's pretty cute. I have retextured a bunch of clothes,
1486500	1489940	so that's kind of what I've been doing. And since I got it through Steam, I'm counting it as part
1489940	1498020	of my gaming week. I have to admit, I'm going to be transparent and say it's taken me a long time
1498020	1504340	to kind of get the Vtuber thing. I was always kind of like, I don't know if it's as interesting to me
1504340	1509540	as watching somebody in an actual cam. So you're seeing unprocessed reactions, things like that.
1509540	1516420	But that being said, as I've been doing my Final Fantasy 16 playthrough, I don't stream all of it.
1516420	1521060	Some of it I do off stream and when I do the off stream stuff, I go off cam and I just record it
1521060	1525780	for YouTube and I put just the gameplay up there. And I have to admit, I definitely notice the
1525780	1532980	amount of extrovert energy. And you all know I'm very much an extrovert, but it's not an
1533540	1540980	infinite tank. I have a big tank, but I don't have an infinite tank. And I definitely notice how much
1540980	1546420	less energy I feel like I'm using not being on actual camera and the lights and all that and
1546420	1554740	doing that than when I am. And so I get it from the person trying to create regular content,
1554740	1558740	but doesn't always have the spoons or whatever you want to call it for it. I get it from that
1558740	1566740	perspective. I really do. Well, there's a little bit for it. For me is the fact that I don't always
1566740	1574020	want to put on a full face of makeup. Especially for my early day Monday stream, when I'm done,
1574020	1581780	I'm going into doing 45 minutes worth of stretches and warm up before my ballet. I don't want to do
1581780	1585940	that with full face makeup on. And I certainly don't want to come back from doing it when I
1585940	1590340	do it while I'm playing Cult of the Lamb and just trying to chill before I take a shower and go to
1590340	1601860	bed. But people like to have some type of person image that they can acknowledge and or interact
1601860	1608420	with, or at least see that something is going on that there might be a person attached to it.
1608420	1613620	And that's the allure of having a VTuber. It also is a way to control your brand.
1614340	1621780	And I can put up some pictures real quick to show people what I've been working on,
1621780	1627460	if you're really interested. Yeah. And I get it because at least even with the VTuber,
1627460	1633780	you still see smile, you still see laugh, you still see movement looking. There's a lot that
1633780	1641140	you are still able to get. So yeah, I get it a lot more than I used to. And that's just maybe the old
1641140	1647220	man in me taking time to roll around. I mean, it took me a while to get Twitch. Now here we are.
1647220	1651220	So you know, it's fine. Sometimes I'm slow to the party. It is what it is.
1652500	1662420	All right. Well, I also think that I can get something to go through my camo app. It's just
1662420	1668100	going to be some doing so. All right. Let's go over to Loki, your gaming week.
1668900	1674740	Um, my week, I played mostly Minecraft. So I put out an episode this week. And then
1676660	1684980	it's been a little bit of that ET sequel, if you will, waste a little bit of time in that
1684980	1690820	and a little bit of protocol game. And I think that was it actually.
1691540	1696340	Okay. Let's see my gaming week. So honestly, it was
1696340	1700100	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't remember one more. I forgot. I downloaded it on my phone,
1701140	1707380	a group coaster because I was getting the urge to play some group coasters. So I was playing that.
1708020	1713620	Okay, nice. Um, let's see my gaming week. Honestly, mostly Final Fantasy 16. It's pretty
1713620	1716900	much all I've been playing. Um, obviously it was a little bit hit and miss of the week with
1716900	1721780	a holiday and everything, but I'm 70% of the way through the game now, which, uh, is that because
1721780	1725780	on your PlayStation main screen, it'll tell you how far you are through the game, but it doesn't
1725780	1731220	count side quests. Um, but I, I would imagine I'm kind of a similar progress through side quests.
1731220	1734900	There's only a couple I haven't finished at this point. Um, but yeah, I'm 70% of the way through
1734900	1739860	the game. So I'm, I'm hoping I can beat it this next week. I did not get as much play in this
1739860	1745140	weekend as I'd hoped, but you know, so it goes sometimes just IRL getting in the way. Uh, like
1745140	1749300	I hosted a show yesterday. It was a lot of fun, but it kept me away from Twitch all day. So, you
1749300	1754100	know, it is what it is. Um, so I'm hoping I'll beat Final Fantasy 16 this week. I really want
1754100	1761380	to be done with 16 in the next week because Diablo four's first season starts on the 20th.
1761380	1765940	And here I've been thinking this whole time, Oh, it's going to start the weekend. I go to Atlanta
1765940	1770260	for Southern fried game gaming expo. And actually, no, it starts the week before.
1770260	1776100	So I can actually get some time in before I go off to Southern fried gaming expo, which by the way,
1776100	1780580	if you forgot is a thing that is happening at the end of the month in Atlanta last weekend of July.
1780820	1785060	I hope to see you there. If you are in the area, um, I will be there for the first time for their,
1785060	1790820	um, 10th anniversary show. Uh, as a result, we will not be here on July 30th. Sorry about that.
1790820	1796580	Um, and then also five weeks later when I go back to Atlanta for dragon con, but that's all right.
1798180	1804500	I have actually math doubt that I have spent, um, obviously the most time of my life I have spent
1804500	1810180	in Sacramento, but now the sec, the city I have spent the second most time in my life is Atlanta
1810660	1816980	with between 10 dragon cons. I've spent more time in Atlanta, even over, um, the Philadelphia area
1816980	1821060	that I used to go to a lot for work. So I've, I've actually spent more time in Atlanta now.
1821060	1826340	So, um, questmaster and chat says finally finished Final Fantasy 16 today. No spoiling it.
1826340	1830580	Thank you. Of course. Uh, but it was an adventure worth experiencing from start to finish for me.
1830580	1834660	Yeah. I've still been enjoying it. I am going to say though, I am at this point in the game,
1834660	1839540	70% of the way through I re like the last time I was streaming the main story quest. I even kind
1839540	1846020	of said this. I'm like, these are really uninteresting filler quests that I'm going
1846020	1853300	through right now. Like I, I unfortunately, I think part of the drawback of Final Fantasy 16,
1853300	1859300	having such a strong opening and then these moments throughout the game that are also
1859300	1866180	very strong and just very like, Holy crap. Most of them centered around the icon versus icon fights.
1866180	1872020	Most of them. Um, it makes those periods in between to kind of get to like, really seem
1872020	1876500	like, okay, let's go, let's go. Let's get back to the interesting stuff. Like it's, it's like
1876500	1881860	watching again, it's like watching a TV show, like Game of Thrones will say, and like some episodes
1881860	1887700	are like filler episodes and some episodes are like red wedding, right? It's like, there's a
1887700	1892420	lot of plot in some episodes and some episodes are a little more, okay. It's, you know, it's,
1892420	1900660	it's not quite as interesting as the others. So also quickly on Final Fantasy 16, I'm going to
1900660	1909620	say this as spoiler free as I can. I did get to the explicit gay scene that had the game banned
1909620	1917860	in Saudi Arabia. It's as, as was said plenty of times on this program, when that new story first
1917860	1927300	came out. It was not sexual in the least. It was a kiss between two guys. That's it. And it was,
1927300	1933460	it was also a reveal of sorts, because you knew nothing about, again, I'm being very vague
1933460	1940900	intentionally, you knew nothing about the sexuality or the interest of the said character
1940900	1946020	in question. And it's one of those things that just kind of like explains that a little bit and
1946020	1953060	their relationship a little bit out of the blue. And I have to say I was really pleasantly
1953060	1959060	surprised by it. I mean, of course, I enjoy the representation. The only thing that made me
1959060	1966260	irritated about that whole situation was that right before the same day I got to that scene
1966900	1974100	that morning on and I'm naming names Kotaku, they ran a story about the relationship and in the
1974100	1978340	fucking thumbnail that went on social media, they showed the two characters that were in
1978340	1985620	the relationship. And so I already knew going into it. That was fucked. I'm sorry. That was,
1985620	1992020	that was really fucked to do for clicks. The game has not even been out a month. That, that was,
1992020	1999300	that was fucky to ruin that for people. Because I also think part of the way they did that,
1999300	2006580	and the nice thing about that is that it was like 20 hours into the game before that was revealed.
2007540	2013620	And again, without the Saudi Arabia thing, nobody ever said anything about the same
2013620	2018020	sex relationship. It never came up in the pre, unless they were asked about it again,
2018020	2022420	because of the Saudi Arabia thing, it never came up. It was not a selling point for the
2022420	2028500	game. It was not something they were advertising. It was just something that happened as
2029300	2034740	it tends to be in life. It just, it just, these people are gay. Okay, deal with it. Like that's
2034740	2040740	it. It's that simple. And the reason why I like how they did what they did 20 hours into the game
2040740	2047780	is because most people, again, in our flash judgment society and social media, they've
2047780	2053780	already after the demo two hours into the game, after their first night in the game, five, six,
2053780	2058580	seven hours into the game, they've already splashed all over social media. I love this
2058580	2063940	game. This is amazing. These combats are awesome. These icon fights are great. Oh my God, this is
2063940	2067460	great. This could be one of the best Final Fantasies. Everybody's already putting that
2067460	2073140	out there, right? So that way, when that scene shows up, they're going to really look like
2073140	2079380	they're putting their clown dress on. If they go back and go, Final Fantasy gone woke, go broke,
2079380	2083700	don't buy Final Fantasy because they're shoving that gay agenda down our throats.
2084100	2092340	They fucking got you bitch, by by putting that in there subtly the way they did. But and in all
2092340	2098020	fairness, and I said this also, again, when the you know, Saudi Arabia kind of first revealed that
2098020	2102420	there would be same sex relationship content in the game. It is hard for me to get out the
2102420	2107380	confetti cannons and celebrate this because I do think this is done well. It is hard for me to get
2107380	2113140	out the confetti cannons and celebrate this when meanwhile, we have these other issues with this.
2113300	2119780	With the racial representation and how that was not done. In a way we would have would have liked
2119780	2126260	to have seen it. So it's kind of one of those restrained celebrations where it's like, Oh,
2126260	2130260	good. I'm glad they did it that way. It's really unfortunate. They couldn't figure this out
2131140	2138500	for all other types of minorities as well. But quest buster in chat says that scene was
2138500	2142340	something that just happens between two people that love each other is that if it was a dude
2142340	2149140	and a woman, not nobody it was it would be like completely like whatever like like it actually
2149140	2156020	like if you really take a step back to think about that scene, it is absolutely a nothing burger for
2156020	2163300	a heterosexual relationship. It is nothing. But the fact that it's two dudes are going to make
2163300	2172740	people go Oh, oh, oh, I, I wait for the day or I would love the day to happen where no one cares.
2173380	2178820	And that's, that's, and the nice thing is, for better for worse in Valstia.
2180020	2184420	No one cares. It's just, it's just there. That's how it should be.
2184420	2190100	That's right. Anyway. All right. That was my high school 16. The only other thing I really played
2190100	2195700	this week was I played Dead by Daylight actually, because it's it isn't I the thing with Dead by
2195700	2200500	Daylight, I only play like one or two matches tops. I'm like, okay, I'm done. But that's still
2200500	2205540	been enough for me. I have like 60. I'm playing it differently this time. And instead of trying
2205540	2210900	to get a couple of me see, instead of trying to get Tara Mises on everybody. I'm just I'm pouring
2210900	2217460	all of my points into Leon Chris Carlos, the himbo trilogy. I'm pouring all of my points into
2217460	2223060	my favorite himbos in the game. And I'm up to like 60 Tara Mises, which for me is a lot.
2223060	2227300	But what what the funny thing about that is I'm also finding not only do I have like 60
2227300	2234340	Tara Mises, I now have like 80 anniversary med kits and like 80 toolboxes and fly I never
2234340	2239860	use flashlights. I'm terrible flesh. But like, I have all of these other anniversary stuff too,
2239860	2246260	that I'm just getting all on my favorite himbo by daylight, folks. So good times.
2247540	2256660	Rob, we need to have you back for for my favorite redeem the Resident Evil roleplay redeem.
2257700	2264980	That was your crit was brilliant. So we have a little a little special cannon
2264980	2274180	in our special Resident Evil part of the dead by daylight universe, where Ada and and Leon
2274180	2278660	celebrate every match by either going to Sizzler or the Brazilian barbecue and they leave Claire
2278660	2284900	at Sizzler. Claire steals Ada's rocket launchers and Chris is a caveman apparently.
2286420	2291780	That's the way I played Chris. He's a himbo. He's our he's our builder punching asshole.
2294020	2301700	All right. It's fanfic by daylight. Yeah. All right. Let's get into some other news
2301700	2307380	going on in some other games around the gaming universe. And of course, we'll get to your
2307380	2312980	comments and calls much later on in the program when we get to our listener roundtable,
2312980	2317140	but we still have some stories to get to first. So Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
2317700	2326020	In the further tales of more old things leaking, we have the Far Cry one source code leaking from
2326020	2335300	2004. That's right. The original Far Cry has been leaked, and it is now on the Internet Archive.
2336180	2345860	The theory behind this is that it came from a possible update to the game that they were adding
2345860	2352900	the Ubisoft Game Launcher or DRM. This is basically it was, I think,
2354260	2361540	put in there by the or this is some comments by a guy who's done other types of leaks before
2361540	2368980	and also is a modder for various games. I don't know how to pronounce their name. Meteoros,
2368980	2374900	I guess, basically saying that the from my educated guess this is some source tree leak
2374900	2381220	from the PC version of the game to add support for Ubisoft Game Launcher slash DRM. It doesn't
2381220	2388900	contain it does contain some executables, but no Xbox code, no game assets. The code that is there
2388900	2396980	doesn't compile without 332 errors. So I think you need to get some debug PC version of the game
2396980	2404500	running or the put some effort and learn the code base. So no word what they're going to be able to
2404500	2410820	do with this, but maybe we'll see it ported to other things or maybe, you know, updated using,
2410820	2418500	you know, fancy ray tracing or something, who knows? Or you can just look at it. Because you can.
2419140	2422820	Yeah, that's that's what most people do with this stuff. They download the source code just be like,
2422820	2426500	Oh, that's neat. I have the source code. And then they open it up and look at the Wow, this is a lot.
2426500	2432740	Okay. Yeah, it's cool to like find out how people used to do things or how it was done before. And
2432740	2436180	you can always use it to like make mods or improvements to the original game.
2436180	2441540	Yeah, no, I was gonna say the the modders are probably the ones celebrating. Most of all,
2442180	2446180	it's it's probably the modders that are going to get the most use out of this because now it's
2446180	2451700	like, Oh, now we can really, I mean, but Far Cry, this this one that leaked is just doesn't have an
2451700	2455700	online component, right? Because Far Cry is I know some of them have online modes, like single
2455700	2462820	player. I don't remember. It was a while ago. I remember it had split screen on Far Cry primal.
2462820	2467940	No, it wasn't primal. What would they call that before? It was instinct. Far Cry instinct was the
2467940	2475300	Xbox version. That had split screen I remember, but I don't think I don't remember if it had
2475300	2482260	online. A bonds 006 clarifies it does not have online. So yeah, so I thought I thought so yeah,
2482500	2486180	because that's that's when the source code leaks on that stuff. That's when it gets you know,
2486180	2489700	really dicey because people are looking for the hacks, the exploits, all that stuff. So I get
2489700	2494580	that. And then Oh, yeah, this would be wouldn't be online now anymore. Anyways, even if it was
2494580	2500660	online at one point. I also like I I don't like I'm not sitting here like also like cheering this
2500660	2505540	because I understand for Ubisoft and the company and all that like it's it this is a even if it is
2505540	2509860	you know, one of the older games. It's still a gigantic pain in the ass. But it's also one of
2509860	2514820	those things where it's like, is the world going to end as a result? Are your profits going to
2514820	2521700	plummet as a result now? You know, go let the modders fuck around and find out and it is you
2521700	2530980	know, it is what it is. So quest buster and chat says that that was the one that had busted stealth
2530980	2535620	because all the enemies could psychically find you with their bullets, whether you were in the open
2535620	2540740	or hiding in a bush. Well, then that makes me think maybe people can go in and fix it kind of
2540740	2546820	like, you know, to do a throwback to something we were talking about earlier the et video game. Like
2546820	2551060	I remember just in the last month, there was, you know, a bunch of stuff on social media about
2551060	2557380	somebody released like a fixed version of et that basically turned et on the Atari 2600 into a
2557380	2559700	pretty decent game. That Yeah, I
2559700	2563060	remember there's like three fixes that they had for that that they implemented.
2563060	2567540	Yeah, well, it just it also made it you know, they had more than six weeks to do it. So they,
2567540	2571140	you know, were able to, you know, put some interesting things in the game, you know,
2571140	2577140	40 years of programming experience on top of that, you know, that would be the interesting thing
2577140	2580740	that could come out of this, you know, especially on top of what quest buster was saying there about
2580740	2584820	Oh, this had this whole broken mechanic. Well, somebody's probably going to go in there and fix
2584820	2589780	it. And now you're going to see like, the definitive far cry or the definitive fan far cry
2589780	2594580	or something because obviously, you can't, you know that if you want to stay from cry,
2595140	2599780	that would cry. I like that. Yeah, if you want to stay from Ubisoft's ire, you got to be careful
2599780	2605540	using, you know, those types of words, but fan cry, I like that, where they can, you know, fix
2605540	2613060	some of these things and make the game even better as a tribute. So as Joe and Matt also points out,
2613060	2616740	source code leak is just a few steps away from putting dicks in the game. Well, come on, that's
2616740	2621540	modders already do that. You don't need source code to do that. Matt, come on. Come on. And but
2621540	2627380	the bonds double six says I like the brokenness of far cry. Well, here's the good news. The source
2627380	2633300	code leaking does nothing to change the original. In fact, I bet it makes the original get ported
2633300	2639460	to more toasters and graphic calculators and refrigerators like that's that's that's what
2639460	2645060	happens when like the doom source code is published for all the download is that Oh, we gotta
2645060	2650660	now we got to put this game on literally everything. So that's what you can look forward
2650660	2660980	to a far cry graphing calculator far cry. All right. Well, speaking of other games with, you
2660980	2665300	know, graphical technology, that's probably not much better than a graphing calculator.
2666020	2672020	We have some updates on Pokemon sleep, and what all is going on with Pokemon sleep. So
2672900	2680500	Pokemon sleep is happening. It's coming later this year. Excuse me later this month,
2680500	2684980	actually. And now we just got a gameplay trailer to come out. We don't have the exact date yet.
2684980	2690580	We know it is coming out in late July. But it's also important to point out this isn't
2690580	2696660	really a game. It's just something that is involving Pokemon that will hook up with things
2696660	2702340	like Pokemon go and assumably, whatever Nintendo's mainline series have in store for
2702340	2708340	Pokemon. So what happens with this, you get paired with a Snorlax, and you increase your bond with
2708340	2714980	Snorlax by sleeping. And if you get a good night's sleep, Snorlax will get drowsy power from you.
2715700	2723220	And then more Pokemon will visit and you'll get rare sleep styles. I think this is just a virtual
2723220	2727780	collection of sorts. When your sleep style decks is filled up with all these different Pokemon,
2727780	2732820	hooray, you caught them all. Congratulations. You can also increase your bond with Snorlax with
2732820	2740100	berries and drinks and all that. But yeah, it does seem interesting that maybe the sleep tracking
2740100	2745460	capabilities are actually going to be pretty well rounded in the games. Your phone's microphone and
2745460	2750580	accelerometer will actually see how much you toss and turn in your sleep or even record your snoring
2750580	2756660	if that's something you want to listen to. If you toss and turn all night, you might get Togepi
2756660	2762740	will actually come out and sing its rocking sleep style. If you snore, Jigglypuff will try to sing
2762740	2769540	you to sleep. This is very silly, but okay. You want me to have nightmares?
2769540	2774260	Yeah. If you put the Pokemon- I keep dreaming about Pokemon. I don't know why.
2774260	2780500	I want to know which Pokemon shows up if you put the app down to record your sleep,
2780500	2785540	and then the bed starts rocking rhythmically. We don't know what Pokemon comes out to-
2791700	2794020	Or if you're having a really good time, Dugtrio. All right.
2796660	2797220	But anyway.
2797940	2798820	You did not go there.
2799460	2808100	I bought a house there. I pay a mortgage there. Anyway, that is the- yeah, Pokemon. Also,
2808100	2813780	you can get this if you want to pair this up with the Pokemon Go Plus bracelet. You can sleep track
2813780	2820340	that way as well. Yeah, it's $30 if you really want that. But good news, the Pokemon sleep app
2820340	2827540	is free because it's mining all of your sleep data for later use. I don't know what companies
2827620	2832580	need with your sleep data, but I bet it's very interesting to know what time the average Pokemon
2832580	2837940	player goes to bed and wakes up. I mean, it's just- it's interesting. So yeah, and Darktosea
2837940	2843540	does say the snoring recording might be useful for a doctor. Yeah, but I do want to be clear,
2843540	2847860	there are other apps out there that are not Pokemon-branded that will do very,
2847860	2850420	very similar things if that is something you're interested in.
2852180	2856100	I just wish that there was like a cute little app like that that I could have used instead
2856100	2859780	of having all of that goo put in my hair to attach the wires to my head when I had
2859780	2865380	my narcolepsy test. Oh, yeah. That was- that shit did not come out. It was terrible.
2866420	2871060	All right, moving on. We have a lot of good retro stories tonight,
2871060	2877300	and I think this is another one. Jamie? Yeah, so you know, we have a love of laser
2877300	2882660	discs in my house, and we're big fans of some of the laser disc games, you know. And Taito put out
2882660	2890020	a few that we got two- I know we got two of them on the Sega CD, but there is, of course,
2890020	2896100	a third one that's going to be added to those other two in a collection, which is the Taito
2896100	2903940	LD game collection. And one of them- I'm sorry, if you've hung out with me or are old or know your
2903940	2910900	anime history, you will know this other name, but the first two- there's Time Gal, which we did get
2910900	2917780	on Sega CD, Revenge of the Ninja, which we also got on Sega CD, I played the crap out of,
2917780	2924100	and Space Battleship Yamato. For the record, for those who do not know, who are also old,
2925380	2934660	we got this in the early 80s, late 70s, was it, as Star Blazers. Even had the same music for-
2934660	2940180	pretty much the same theme song. I mean, like, it was pretty much word for word translation,
2940260	2948260	but anyway. So, but anyway, these were all games that were originally on laser discs.
2949300	2951780	And if you don't know what laser discs are, get off my lawn.
2953940	2957940	Basically, if you know how big a record album is, you know what record albums are,
2957940	2964020	because now they're what the cool kids use. They were, like, giant CD in that size,
2964020	2968260	and you put them on, and they were double-sided, and, you know, if you were watching a movie on it,
2968260	2973700	you'd probably have to get up and flip the disc unless you had, like, a double-sided reader or
2973700	2985060	something. And then, but anyway, with this, it's basically, you would play on your- well,
2985060	2988900	in the arcades, you would, of course, have a joystick or a button that you would either
2988900	2993540	press in a direction when you got a visual clue, or hit a certain button, again, with a visual
2993540	3000740	clue. And you could watch and participate in a story, and there's only one right answer,
3001540	3009700	usually, in these games. There were other ones that came out. I mean, there was- Lupin,
3009700	3013780	Castle of Cagliostro came out as a game called Cliffjumper. Do you remember that?
3014580	3015300	I don't think so.
3016260	3022100	Yeah. But anyway, these are all three of them. I mean, for laser disc games, you're pretty good,
3022580	3025860	pretty neat little stories. I mean, Time Gal, I didn't play a whole lot of,
3025860	3032660	but I did play a lot of Revenge of the Ninja. And so, this is going to be out on Switch, and
3035460	3043220	I'm trying to see, because I had the date here a second ago. It was on Taito's announcement page,
3043220	3049860	I think, which is in Japanese, so let me see if I can find the date listed. It says December 14th,
3049860	3059540	2023. So yeah, hopefully we'll get it over here too. But yeah, I'm actually looking
3059540	3062020	forward to the Yamato one. I've never gotten to play that one.
3062020	3062900	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
3064020	3064820	Yeah.
3064820	3066180	All right, moving on.
3066740	3068740	Now the Yamato song is stuck in my head.
3070420	3073060	All right, well, while you hum that, Loki, what's next for us?
3073780	3082100	It's more stuff to come out of the whole Microsoft and Activision acquisition thing.
3082100	3089300	So this actually reveals some stuff about Sony. In the core filings, it mentioned that basically,
3089860	3096900	the PlayStation likewise sells a less expensive digital edition for $399.99 and is expected to
3096900	3102900	release a PlayStation 5 slim later this year at the same reduced price point. And then they also
3102980	3107540	have another comment in that filing as well saying the PlayStation, meanwhile, currently
3107540	3113140	offers two different versions of the PlayStation 5, one with a Blu-ray player for physical media
3113140	3118900	standard and one without digital and is anticipated to release further differentiated
3118900	3126260	pro and slim models in the near future. So is Microsoft leaking out that Sony has a pro and
3127060	3132180	slim version or is it just their speculation that they're including in this? Who knows?
3132900	3140980	But this is part of their document titled the console market must include Nintendo.
3142420	3145540	I don't know that I didn't really have anything to do with Nintendo,
3145540	3149380	but I guess includes all three consoles in there.
3152180	3153860	Well, but not unexpected.
3153860	3157940	Yeah. And, you know, obviously, you know, some people have been trying to discount
3157940	3165540	Nintendo and this is not being high end because, you know, it's including Nintendo or not
3165540	3170100	as a competitor makes a big deal in these, you know, anti-competition sort of things. Right.
3170100	3176820	So yeah. Yeah. Well, boy, but we we're really not going to hear the end of this for some time.
3176820	3181540	That's for sure. With the court cases. Or do we know? Do we know if there's an end date on
3181540	3187300	the court case? I guess. I don't know. I know they had some dates for filings and stuff like that,
3187300	3191940	but I think it's still in the hands of the FTC right now.
3191940	3198420	Gotcha. All right. Well, moving on to oh, I can't believe this guy's back in the news,
3198420	3203140	but guess what? Peter Molyneux. We've got some news and updates on Peter Molyneux. I mean,
3203140	3209860	if you think about it, he's kind of he's been gone for a little while. You know, what's in the cube?
3209860	3213540	Remember that? That was 2012. That was over 10 years ago.
3213620	3220740	Just the headline. Headline is just it's just like it's so Peter Molyneux like seriously.
3221780	3229060	And then I believe he did the Trail Frontier challenge in 2017. But apparently now
3230740	3235700	he's back and coding a new game. But we don't know if this has anything to do
3235700	3239620	with blockchain gaming, because the last time we heard from this guy,
3240340	3245380	it had to do with blockchain gaming. But he's coding a new game and apparently say this the
3245380	3250660	first time that he is coding something since black and white, that he's actually in there
3250660	3258900	coding it himself. So that's kind of interesting. Apparently, it's some all new mechanic. So he says
3260260	3264580	in days gone by, I would just start telling you about the whole game and the whole game design
3264580	3268340	and why it was going to be the most brilliant game in the world. I'm not going to do that.
3269220	3275220	But he did say this mechanic will be part of a familiar environment, more like kind of a fable
3275220	3280580	black and white Dungeon Keeper kind of experience. So this is sounding like another medieval type of
3280580	3287860	game. Could be interesting. This is going to be a plan for PC and consoles first, which is
3287860	3292100	a departure from 22 cans who made what's in the cube and all that stuff because that was designed
3292100	3302180	around smartphones, as you may recall. So yeah, this is I mean, I guess going to be interesting.
3302180	3308580	I'm glad he knows to just kind of shut up for the moment. But we'll see. Yeah, does he though. So
3308580	3312580	we'll see how long he can actually do that. So we have some more information on the actual game.
3313620	3319540	Yeah, I just I don't know. Like, it feels like though he's still trying to tease it in a way
3319540	3324500	like he did before. No, he never did come out and tell us what like everything was. He would always
3324500	3329460	like, mull over like a specific point that was going to be revolutionary and never seen before,
3329460	3336340	but it always wasn't. So like, I don't know. I don't believe anything he says.
3337460	3342260	I mean, the cube thing was funny for a minute, but only because it was like meme people were
3342260	3346900	drawing dicks all over the cube because that was you put you poke at the cube and everybody else
3346900	3352580	is poking into the cube too. And so if you find your little corner, you could poke dicks and boobs
3352580	3356740	and all the things you're not supposed to be drawing on a you know, shared canvas around the
3356740	3360660	world. But this is what it is. And whatever happened with like the profits that they were
3360660	3364340	supposed to getting from that one game where they supposed to be sharing profits or something like
3364340	3369220	that or something. I thought there was a whole like profit share thing with that where what
3369220	3377540	profits that would have the game making a profit. It's like, actually, actually, you you get to pay
3377540	3384100	the debts that we have. You're a winner. You win. And now sit here at this table and pay the bill
3384100	3391300	while the rest of us leave the restaurant. All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.
3392260	3399940	Well, I'm Super Mario RPG, you know, we're getting we're getting the the remake, right?
3399940	3404100	Supposed to be out on November 17, a game I can get excited about. Yes.
3405060	3413620	Right. Well, the original director Fujioka Chihiro is actually not involved in it,
3413620	3420340	but he's really looking forward to playing it. And he's quoted as even saying, I am very surprised
3421060	3428660	and pleased with the news. And of course, he's been excited for how many people have been thanking him
3428660	3438660	for it. But good news is that one of my favorite game composers, Shimomura Yoko is returning to
3438660	3448180	do the music. Yeah. So she also did Kingdom Hearts. A lot of Kingdom Hearts stuff, too.
3448900	3454420	So I am. I think it's going to be all right. I'm feeling like it's going to be good.
3454420	3461060	So I didn't talk about it in my gaming week, but since Alan was at Costco yesterday, I said,
3461060	3466580	Hey, I'm going to Venmo you $90. And I want you to get me the $100 of Nintendo gift card thing.
3466580	3474740	So he did. And I use the I got the voucher today on Nintendo online. So I did buy Zelda Tears of
3474740	3479620	the Kingdom. I just haven't played it yet. And I'm gonna put the other I put the other voucher
3479620	3486660	on the Mario RPG pre order. So I have I got both those games for 45 bucks a pop as opposed to
3487380	3492340	70 for Tears of the Kingdom. So extreme couponing. I love it.
3495620	3500500	But yes, fantastic. It is. Don't forget that is a trick. I'm not sure who else. I mean, I don't
3500500	3504500	want to just only endorse Costco. I don't know if there's other stores that offer a similar deal.
3505220	3510820	Costco, you can get 90 or you can get $100 worth of Nintendo bucks for 90 bucks. And then you go
3510820	3516100	and you spend that 100 bucks on the two vouchers and bam $45 games, you could still use them like
3516740	3521060	if you already bought Tears of the Kingdom as I imagine most of you did, you could still use them
3521060	3525380	on the two Mario games coming out and it would stay like Mario wonder and Mario RPG, which I
3525380	3529460	imagine a lot of you are probably going to get and you would still save money and Pikmin four
3529460	3533700	is eligible to and there's other games too. I think Wario aware is eligible to but Wario
3533700	3539940	aware is only a $50 game anyway. So it is interesting. The prices they're charging for
3539940	3544820	some games versus others just please just promise me promise me everyone. You're not going to use a
3544820	3551780	voucher on everybody one to switch. Don't don't do that. Don't do that. Please don't buy that game.
3551780	3559380	There you go. Quest buster and chat says Tears of the Kingdom is so good. Lots to explore and do.
3559380	3563220	It's already one of my top games for this year. And I can't see in chat says,
3563220	3567220	let us know when you do play Zelda. I want to hear your take. Yeah, I'll probably stream it.
3567780	3574100	Honestly, I'm curious about it for sure. So all right, let's move on. Loki.
3575220	3582340	Yes. So we talked about last week how Val was going to be taking down some games that had AI
3582340	3589620	generated stuff in them. Well, they kind of walked back a little bit. Basically making a
3589620	3596180	statement it to Polygon said that they didn't really have they have no desire to discourage
3596180	3604100	the use of AI in games development. But, you know, suggest that perhaps existing copyright laws
3604100	3609220	might do the job for them when it comes to AI created assets. They said the introduction of AI
3609220	3615620	sometimes makes it harder for or harder to show a developer has sufficient rights to use AI to
3615620	3621380	create the assets, including images, text and music. In particular, there are some legal
3621380	3628740	uncertainty related to the data used to train AI models. There's lots of lawsuits. Sarah Silverman,
3628740	3635300	for example. Yeah, I just heard about that today. Yeah. It is the developer's responsibility to
3635300	3640500	make sure that they have the appropriate rights to ship their game. Basically, it's the developer's
3640500	3644740	responsibility to cover their ass because we're not going to cover their ass. And if it comes down
3644740	3650500	to them suing us, we're going to point them in your direction type of thing. We know it's
3650500	3654340	constantly evolving tech and our goal is not to discourage the use of it on Steam. Instead,
3654340	3659540	we're working through how to integrate it into our already existing review policies.
3659540	3664820	Stated plainly, our review process is a reflection of the current copyright law and policies
3664820	3671140	and not an added layer of our opinion. As these laws and policies evolve over time,
3671140	3677860	so will our process. Well, I mean, it's interesting that they are having to kind
3677860	3682500	of respond to this in real time as the world is figuring this thing out. And like you said,
3683060	3687060	now the litigation, something we didn't really bring up last week, because I know we got really
3687060	3692100	into it last week on this discussion, but now we're seeing the litigation side of this. And
3692100	3696100	now that we have Sarah Silverman, it's not just her, there's like two other authors that are
3696100	3700580	suing. And if you haven't heard of this, basically, because they're alleging that
3700580	3706580	chat GPT and some of the open platforms were trained off of their books, and they proved it
3706580	3712580	by going to the sites and basically saying, can you summarize the book? And it's giving like
3712580	3718260	excerpts straight out of the book, basically. And so they were like, this is copyright infringement,
3718820	3721460	essentially. Well, it's I think, am I getting it right?
3723140	3727700	Potentially, it's copyright. Well, that's the law, the lawsuit alleges copyright infringement,
3727700	3732020	right? That could, it could be also to like, I mean, that's going to be a case they're
3732020	3736740	going to have to make. Because if it's looking to summarize it, it could be looking at reviews
3736740	3742820	of a book by other people. And if they cite quotes in those reviews, then essentially,
3742820	3747620	it's taking quotes from those books, but it may not even be looking at those books. Also, if it
3747620	3755860	can, you know, scrape the web, it may be able to pull excerpts from, like samples of the book,
3755860	3759620	you know, if you have an e book, you may put out a few chapters or, you know,
3759620	3766500	a small section of it to give the readers an idea of what it looks like. And so yeah, I mean,
3766500	3770340	I don't know, it's gonna be something they have to prove. At least it wasn't them going,
3770340	3775220	did you write this? Or, you know, is did you get this from this, you know, because the AI doesn't
3775220	3780820	know it'll make up stuff all the time. Yeah. Um, you know, and this isn't the only hot button
3780820	3785940	thing going on with AI in gaming this week. I know on social media, there is a lot that happened just
3785940	3790020	because I am fortunate enough through the panels I've done over the years and stuff. I have friends
3790020	3795300	that are voice actors that were kind of joining in this debate that was going on, I believe she
3795300	3799620	was a voice actress with persona five, but she ultimately ended up taking a break from social
3799620	3804020	media just because people were being miserable to her as people on social media tend to do or let's
3804020	3807700	say Twitter, it's Twitter. Because I don't I don't see the same shit on blue sky. That's for
3807700	3817060	sure. It's fucking Twitter. So um, and it was about that somebody used AI and her voice to get
3817060	3824580	her to sing a song as one of her characters, but it was the AI as her voice. And she's like, don't
3824580	3829940	hell no. Yeah, she's like, don't fucking do that bass. I'm extremely paraphrasing. But she say,
3829940	3835060	don't fucking do that. And my friends that are voice actors are also chiming in. Don't fucking
3835060	3841140	do that. And I as a podcaster would also like to chime in. Don't fucking do that with our podcast
3841140	3845940	and all that stuff. Because a joke had come up earlier in Bobby's chat room. And I know it's a
3845940	3850420	joke. It's whatever. But you know, they were they were saying, Oh, we could do a Bobby Black Wolf AI
3850420	3855780	show because he's out tonight and all that stuff. And yet, no, it's cute as a joke. But the problem
3856340	3862500	is a joke either. Well, well, it's not cute as a joke, because over here behind door number two,
3862500	3869940	we have the legit legit issue that this actress is raising. And this also leads to now the other
3869940	3878740	concern. If AI can perfectly replicate these voices, will the voice actors be called for
3878740	3885060	these different projects? By the way, this all is why a bit why shouldn't say the only reason why
3885060	3892340	but a big sticking point in why the Writers Guild is striking, and the Actors Guild Screen Actors
3892340	3901860	Stage Guild is about to strike its AI and the rights to, you know, use AI, or in some cases,
3901860	3909540	Hello, Indiana Jones, D age them, or Star Wars, or many of these other things. Now, I believe,
3909540	3914260	especially in the case of Indiana Jones, where the actor is in the film, they had the person's
3914260	3922180	permission to do things. But what if they didn't? You know, or what if could they say by starring
3922180	3925940	in this, you have given us the right to do that sort of thing? I think there have been some legal
3925940	3930340	issues that have come up with this previously. But still, it's just it's all of this is like,
3930340	3935620	this is this is really coming to a head with AI. And like, what are the ethical ways you can use
3935620	3939460	it and not and again, and I think this kind of lends into something we were talking about last
3939460	3944020	week, it's going to be about how do you train it? What's the information that you're giving it?
3944020	3948740	If it's your own information for your own purposes? All right, then. But if it's, you know,
3949620	3956500	books, podcasts, anime, anime vocal songs, and things that you did not give permission for it
3956500	3959300	to learn off of, it's not okay. It's copyright infringement.
3960420	3967460	And you know, though, there's going to come in like, how to like, I'm going to throw this out
3967460	3974260	there. So say that they wanted to do a Rocky and Bullwinkle revival. Is June Faure's estate
3974260	3982660	going to allow her voice to be used? You know, or, you know, so and so, you know, deceased actor,
3982660	3990580	you know, is it in general, is it ethically okay to raise the dead to make money off of them?
3991300	3995380	But coming back to a point that was made on the show last week, if they bring somebody else in
3995380	4000660	to impersonate June Faure, then that's different. You know, and that actually happens a lot where
4000660	4004980	you bring somebody else in the kind of sounds like the deceased or otherwise departed actor.
4004980	4009220	You know, that happens all the time. That's that is a completely different thing. I mean,
4009940	4014260	for in some cases, especially if the voice actor did not come back due to a contract
4014260	4020180	dispute or something, it might come off as tacky, but it is a completely different situation than
4020180	4029780	this. For sure. So quick, break man says quick, someone make a Rocky pull or scroll off the
4029780	4033380	screen. Sorry. Quick, someone make a polar rabbit from a hat joke. Yes.
4035060	4038260	You see me quoting the whole rest of it. I know. I know. I know.
4038260	4042100	That trick never works. So I do want to put on the sleeve.
4042100	4045780	I do want to point out, though, as much as we're all sitting here going, yeah,
4045780	4049540	this shouldn't happen with this particular voice actors. I want to remind people,
4049540	4053700	she deactivated Twitter and all this stuff took social media great because people were
4053700	4059060	bullying her from the perspective of, no, we should get to do this. It was just in fun.
4059060	4063140	It was a fan project. It was an excuse, excuse, excuse, excuse.
4064100	4068900	But people said, no, the implications. Yeah. And she said, no, that should be enough.
4071220	4077140	Yeah. Do not consent. End of story. What if this had been, what if this had been, um,
4077140	4080500	and I'm going to add actually in, cause I do think a bit of sexism has to do with,
4080500	4084180	it would have been a male actor, voice actor. If he said no,
4086260	4088260	probably would have been gotten the same level of flack.
4089860	4094180	The backlash. Yeah. I think, I think you're right. The backlash would not be as intense.
4096740	4102900	Anyway. Um, yeah. And break man is talking about movies, bringing actors back to life again.
4102900	4106180	You know, if they have the permission from the estate and all that it's different. Uh,
4106180	4111380	break man says concerts with dead musicians, you know, the, the Tupac hologram, did they have Tupac
4111380	4115940	estates consent? If they did then whatever I'm assuming they had to have, um, or the,
4115940	4120820	I think of the ABBA hologram show. Well, ABBA participated in the making of that. They were very,
4120820	4125140	they did that so that they wouldn't have to tour. So they absolutely support it.
4125140	4130580	Again, that's different. That's using the technology and stuff in good ways and ways that,
4130580	4135220	you know, are fine. It's these things that are unethical. Gorillas.
4136180	4143780	Tried to do a concert and that all failed. They did it. The Grammys, I think. Yeah. And then when
4143780	4151380	Madonna came out, her bass was so loud that it made the, uh, holograms vibrate. Yeah. Yeah.
4152580	4158100	All right. Uh, moving on. Um, let's talk about, Oh, some not so great news out of Niantic,
4158100	4163780	which is, you know, I, I said plenty about this last week, but now on top of this,
4163780	4168260	this week, they are being accused of a systemic sexual bias in a lawsuit.
4168260	4172900	A former Niantic employee who was laid off as part of the layoffs that happened,
4172900	4177860	that we were reporting about on the show has now filed a lawsuit against Niantic alleging
4177860	4183220	that a devalued the work of female employees and women of color denied equal pay to women employees
4183220	4188900	and women of color. Uh, the lawsuit is going for a clash action status. So right now it's being
4188900	4194020	raised by one individual, but they are looking to make it class action. And they use the term
4194020	4200020	boys club, uh, throughout the lawsuit. Uh, again, that employee was laid off. Um, but they are,
4200020	4206100	and they are coming forward as an anonymous Jane Doe. Uh, all we know in the, uh, uh, lawsuit is
4206100	4211220	that they are, uh, Asian female who worked at Niantic in February of 2020. Oh, what a heck of
4211220	4216580	a start date. They're, uh, considering everything to happen. They started with a salary of 70 K.
4216580	4222980	And then later that year they were promoted to get about 84 K. But then in 2021, she learned
4222980	4228180	that a male colleague was making more money, even though she had a higher job title and more
4228180	4234260	responsibilities than he did. Allegedly that employee was being paid 127 K per year, and she
4234260	4239140	was being paid 105 K per year. So I don't know, I guess maybe that's a year later or whatever,
4239140	4244980	despite being a job level higher. And then around spring of 2023, she received a raise to 115 per
4244980	4251700	year, still below the male colleague. Now, I don't want to discount the argument here.
4252740	4257780	There are still some question marks with this because I have heard of these situations where
4257780	4261700	people get paid different because like experience or whatever, but I also don't want to discount
4261700	4266900	this person's concerns. It'll come out in a courtroom. We'll see what happens. I'm curious
4266900	4272660	to see, will others join on to the lawsuit as well? Because that's going to be telling,
4272980	4279140	again, it's just the reality. When it's one person, well, could there be a specific situation
4279140	4282660	or something going on? But then when it's multiple people complaining of the same thing,
4282660	4287060	well, you can't say it's an individual situation now at that point because it's affecting
4287060	4292900	multiple people and whatever's going on. Because apparently then it gets to this whole thing about
4292900	4298580	the employee discussed the concern with female staffers, sexism and equal pay were brought up
4298580	4304020	with the group Wolfpack, which is the employee resource group for women. But then when the
4304020	4308420	employee went to Niantic's diversity, equity and inclusion director and principal people partner,
4309060	4313780	they had made clear that they and male upper management Niantic were hostile to her complaints
4313780	4318900	or voiced concerns about sexism or sexual bias in the workplace. And then they said the job
4318900	4325220	evaluations, allegedly the job evaluations were affected by her discussing the workplace issues
4325300	4330100	with her colleagues and said that she was paid below the range because she raised the concerns
4330100	4334900	with her colleagues. And that's illegal. That is absolutely illegal. And on top of that,
4334900	4339940	if any company ever tells you that you can't discuss your pay, they're full of shit.
4339940	4344100	Right. You should discuss your pay. It should be open and honest for everybody.
4344100	4350020	But I will still be very curious to hear their side of it because the way you do it could still
4350020	4356180	be open to, you know, whatever, you know, obviously, things are not good at Niantic.
4356180	4360580	And I can't you know, this story coming out as one of those like, of course, because this is
4360580	4364900	a problem in our industry, right? We've we've learned that since the Activision Blizzard
4364900	4369860	lawsuit, it is not unique to just Activision Blizzard, it was certainly exacerbated in that
4369860	4376020	whole situation. But this is a problem that you know, permeates our industry. I will just be very
4376020	4383060	interested to see, is it just one or is it much more? You know, because again, the individual
4383060	4387860	concern and that whole debate kind of goes out the window when now five women come forward and say,
4387860	4392420	Yeah, this is a systemic problem. So we'll see. Anyway,
4392420	4401220	And the other thing too, is that it's there's a whole bunch of other just bullshit behind it.
4401220	4408500	Where I have it all in my head, and it's really hard for me to put this in words.
4409540	4417060	But there also is this societal bias, regardless that people are constantly having to fight
4417060	4427060	against. And people are way too quick to dismiss a woman's claim anyway. You know, like, Oh,
4427060	4434020	just being sensitive or blah, blah, blah, this, or, you know, need to just suck it up or whatever.
4434020	4439940	No, no. Talk about it. And if you are in a situation like this,
4440660	4449460	and you feel that you're not making what you're worth, I mean, bring it up and protect yourself,
4449460	4452580	save a paper trail of who you talk to and what you talk to them about.
4453380	4457620	Yeah. And I want to be clear. I'm not just, yeah. And I want to be clear. I'm not dismissing this
4457620	4461540	woman's complaints. I'm just curious what's going to come out in the courtroom. I'm curious to hear
4461540	4465220	the other side of it. That's all. Well, I know you wouldn't be like that. Yeah. But
4466500	4474340	the biggest thing is just, you know, give, give, give the person some credit because they wouldn't
4474340	4478820	say something if it hadn't happened. Yeah. At least that's, that's always my theory.
4478820	4487700	Yeah. All right. All right. Well, let's, let's take a moment to take a trip down memory lane in
4487700	4494580	an age long before AR gaming companies. We're going to take a trip down memory lane in our next
4494580	4510980	segment right now. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the
4510980	4517140	vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
4518100	4525140	And what is that game this week? Oh, gosh. The game this week is forgotten worlds.
4527540	4530820	I was a little bit surprised that I hadn't done it. I had, you know,
4530820	4534500	it's sort of like these days, if it's something I haven't done, I'm like,
4534500	4540820	when did I not do this? Why haven't I done this? Excuse me. What planet am I on right now? But this
4540820	4550820	was indeed one that I had not done. So we're, we're going to discuss some classic game tonight.
4550820	4558420	So forgotten worlds is or as it was called in Japan, lost worlds is a side scrolling shooter
4558420	4568100	by Capcom. It was originally released as an arcade game in 1988. And it's notable for being the first
4568100	4577060	title for being released on Capcom's CP system. So is basically set in the 29th century where
4577060	4586100	this evil god known as Bios has fucked up the earth. And now it's called the dust world. And
4586100	4594740	so super soldiers are made by these people scientists to defeat Bios and the eight evil gods
4595380	4603780	and like, sort of like sci fi fantasy ish. So anyway, it can be played by up to two players
4603780	4614820	simultaneously. And it's a, it's an interesting little kind of game. So basically, one player
4616340	4621940	can control one of the muscle soldiers with a rifle with unlimited ammo, you're equipped
4621940	4627940	with long range automatic rifle, and then player two has a short range wide shot. So
4628580	4634900	you got an eight way joystick in the arcade and a roll switch, which is this rotatable button.
4634900	4641700	So if you rotate it, it allows you to adjust where your character is aiming in one of 16 directions.
4642980	4650580	And so you can pretty much rapidly change your direction anywhere. And also if you
4650580	4656660	press the switch button, you know rapidly, then you have a mega crush attack that destroys
4656660	4664740	anything on screen, but it also takes part of your life to do so. You have a little module that
4664740	4672020	goes with you, that's your backup firepower. And it can be rotated as well with the roll switch.
4673540	4680340	So if you rotate the character, while fighting will only rotate the aim of the satellite,
4680340	4685700	but rotating the character without firing, rotates the satellites aim and also its relative
4685700	4690740	position around the player. So you can also get these blue colored coins called zenny,
4690740	4696900	because I guess video games like zenny as a currency from defeating enemies. It's used to
4696900	4702580	buy power ups from shops that are in different areas in each stage. And then you're given a
4702580	4706980	choice of whatever item is available and limited time to make your purchase. So you can get new
4706980	4715140	weapons for your satellite, but you also get health kits for vitality and even tips on how
4715140	4725060	to defeat the bosses in the stage. So it has nine stages, each with its own boss and you will lose
4725060	4733860	your vitality gauge. If it runs out, then you also get a good chance to continue. So the game itself
4733860	4741220	took two years to develop and had a production budget of five million dollars, which as of 2022
4741220	4749300	would have been about 12 million dollars and had four megabytes of sprite data. And it started off
4749300	4757460	as like a normal side scrolling shooter, but Okamoto Yoshiki wanted a very imaginative game.
4757460	4765220	And so Capcom tried to make it easier to play because it was really hard to dodge at first.
4766980	4771060	But Capcom also really wanted to show up the capability of the CPS-1.
4772340	4777220	It didn't really make a lot of money because there were a bunch of shooters on the market
4778900	4785300	and it also made increase in different expenses because of the shortage of chips needed for the
4785300	4794100	CPS-1 boards. It was first ported to home computers in Europe by U.S. Gold in 1989.
4794100	4801700	There were versions for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC,
4801700	4814580	TurboGrafx-16, and IBM compatible PCs. It was later, those versions were developed by
4814580	4826260	Ark Developments and they had four months to make the conversions. So they were okay.
4829540	4836500	Basically, they had to redraw everything from, well, a few things from hand. The shop was done
4836500	4848260	by hand and the computer aspects were redrawn with deluxe paint and the frames were digitized
4848260	4856660	from the arcade's version with this DigiView Gold device. So they tried. They all needed a
4856660	4861540	joystick to play. Could not be played with a keyboard except for the IBM PC versions,
4861540	4868100	ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC versions. You rotated the character by holding the fire button
4868100	4877620	while pushing the joystick. But it did okay. The ZX Spectrum sales, it was number two behind Robocop
4878500	4886740	which was pretty much number one for the entire year. So there was a Mega Drive Genesis version
4886740	4892980	produced by Sega that was released in Japan November 18th 1989 and had subsequent releases in
4893620	4902340	North America and Europe. They tried really to simulate the controls by having the A and C buttons
4902340	4908580	do the rotation and the B button for shooting. But they made sure that both characters had the
4908580	4916900	long-ranged automatic rifle and only seven of the nine stages were ported in and had an auto
4916900	4923780	fire feature. In 2008, the Mega Drive version was released on Wii Virtual Console in North America
4924500	4932580	and in Europe after that. There was a Master System version that came out in Europe and Brazil
4932580	4939860	because we know how they love the Master System in Brazil. It's a one player only version and
4941620	4948980	the buttons on the system were just used for rotation and shooting was automatic. The
4948980	4954420	Mega Crush you would have to just press both simultaneously. The TurboGrafx-16 version was
4954420	4964180	produced by NEC Avenue and released in 1992 as a Super CD-ROM2 title that had a special three
4964180	4970900	button controller that NEC only released in Japan. There was an American version by Turbo Technologies
4972420	4980900	and so basically it controlled very similar to the Mega Drive version. Now the run button on a
4980900	4989300	standard controller was used for the rotation but it was one player only. There was a version
4989300	4996100	planned for the Capcom Power System Changer but it didn't get released. There's an emulation of
4996100	5004500	the original version in the 2005 Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PS2 and Xbox, 2006 Capcom
5004500	5011140	Classics Collection Remixed for PSP, and then Nintendo Switch and Capcom Arcade Stadium.
5012580	5020020	The PS2 and Xbox version will allow you to use the analog sticks to control your character's aim.
5020580	5027460	A 2008 Sega Mega Drive and Genesis version that came to the Wii of course it's
5027700	5036500	controlled as advertised. So it was as far as reception. The arcade version pretty much
5036500	5042740	got very positive reviews across the board. The home versions were also very positive but the
5042740	5051220	Master System one did not get as great reviews. I mean then again it's a very scaled down version
5051220	5058980	of the game. But the magazine Game Machine listed Forgotten Worlds on their September 1st,
5058980	5066500	1988 issue as the second most successful table arcade unit of the month. It outperformed Sky
5066500	5076740	Soldiers and Ninja Spirit. So at the 1988 Gamest Awards in Japan it received the Best Graphics
5076740	5086420	Award and the home computer versions were, like I said, very well received and got some internal
5086420	5094580	magazine rewards. So yeah, that is our game Forgotten Worlds or Lost Worlds, the first
5094580	5103700	game released on Capcom CPS1. All right, I do remember this game vaguely. I know some of these
5103780	5108260	shooters from the 90s I don't always recall but this one I do remember playing.
5108260	5109620	This one was very unique.
5109620	5114740	Something about the space dragons and the dudes floating in the air with their little
5114740	5119140	sidekick spaceships. Yeah, it's very unique. It stands out.
5119140	5125220	It's the rotating element for it for me. I don't think anything else was doing that at the time.
5126100	5132980	So, and, and honestly, I kind of don't see them like even in retro arcades that much.
5134260	5137860	But if you find one in arcade, please take me a picture of it and tell me where it is.
5138660	5142580	The closest thing I could think of his life force but it's not even like the same,
5142580	5150980	you know, like forces salamander but but just Yeah, just like how novel that was when that
5150980	5153700	happened right so it's like kind of like the first step to that but yeah.
5154420	5157940	Anyway, good pick classic game of the week.
5157940	5161540	Break man that monsters poor abs he probably spent hours in the monster gym.
5162500	5168340	That I think that's just armor. I bet anything that he strapped into that armor and inside he's
5168340	5176180	like my skin is pushing into my spleen. And then after he explodes he's probably dying from relief
5176260	5182500	from having that tight armor taken off. I come up with head cannons. It's what I do.
5183620	5188420	All right. We'll see what head cannon you come up with for a classic game next week. But meantime,
5189140	5193940	we're gonna do some rap. Actually, that's that's what I that's, that would be a fun
5193940	5198980	year twist segment. Game that Jamie classic game that Jamie has rewritten the plot to
5200260	5205060	just be well that would be many games. Exactly. You could do a year full of that.
5205060	5213700	My whole rewrite of Mass Effect. My head cannons and the special head cannons for Dead by Daylight
5213700	5223060	and and the Guardian legend where she's, you know, decides to flip everybody off and retire in Boca.
5224340	5230260	All right. Save it for the segments next year or the year after. All right. Moving on. Let's
5231220	5235620	check out some other headlines rapidly in a segment appropriately called rapid fire news.
5236260	5244260	Loki. Yeah, we have the new courses coming for Mario Kart eight deluxe next week. So
5245140	5251220	booster course pass five. And with that, of course, I think we talked about this when they
5251220	5260100	haven't attended direct. So Kamek is joining as well as Petey Piranha and Wiggler are three new
5260100	5268820	characters. Course wise, they're going to have the Cherry Cup, which has the Los Angeles track,
5269540	5278100	Sunset Wilds from Mario Kart Super Circuit, Koopa Kate from Mario Kart Wii, Vancouver Velocity from
5278100	5284900	also Mario Kart Tour. And then they also have the Feather Cup, which has Daisy's Cruiser from Mario
5284900	5292340	Kart Double Dash, Moon View Highway from Mario Kart Wii. They have the Athens Dash from Mario
5292340	5301540	Kart Tour and then the brand new squeaky clean sprint, which is that bathroom one. Looks cool.
5302420	5310100	And then, of course, we got another trailer for Mortal Kombat one, and they showed off smoke and
5310100	5318340	rain as, I believe, cameo characters. Oh, no, they're playable characters as well. And then
5318340	5326980	sector Cyrax frost scorpion as cameo fighters. Shaping up to be an interesting roster in game.
5327140	5331460	Um, I might check it out. We'll see. You know, I think those fatalities are like,
5331460	5334980	but now I don't know. There's a part of me that now I'm just kind of like, I can just
5337060	5341060	like, my brain can just shut off when that all happens. Like, that's kind of where I'm at at
5341060	5347700	this point. You know what I always hear in my head whenever I see a fatality? Like lately,
5348260	5356820	I hear you impersonating your mom. Rob, that's gross. Turn it off. People. Oh my God. Oh my
5357220	5363060	God. Rob. Yeah, pretty much. I literally do hear that in my head.
5365140	5372980	All right. Uh, what, what story do you have for us? Um, pole position. Anyway,
5373540	5382180	um, not to go into the theme song, but, um, there is a, another title coming to the arcade archives
5382180	5390340	in his pole position, um, which was released by Namco back in 1982. It will be on switch for July,
5390340	5398900	on July 26, 2023. Um, sorry on the sixth. So it's already out, um, for 7 99. Go get it.
5399940	5406260	Tell me how it is. Right. Um, something I think a lot of you already got that I just mentioned,
5406260	5410820	I got earlier today was the legend of Zelda tears, the kingdom. And I picked it up just
5410820	5417220	in time for the version 1.2 0 upgrade because the game got its, uh, I guess first major patch
5417220	5422020	this week. I don't recall another one having hit before. Uh, but you know, not that a ton
5422020	5427140	of things are like changed in the game, but there are a few things, uh, for one, uh, if you start
5427140	5432900	the game within certain articles released on a specific switch news channel, you can get a
5432900	5437700	number of in-game items. So it sounds like they built in the capability to get bonus items. If
5437700	5441460	you read a certain news article within switch, that's what it sounds like. Uh, it sounds like
5441460	5446020	they got some, uh, progression based bugs. So certain main quests were bugs and side
5446020	5450820	adventures were bugs. So they, um, updated all that in this, uh, some ferries sometimes
5450820	5455940	do not appear in certain conditions. So they fixed that, uh, the meals provided by Kiana and
5455940	5461620	Lurelin village, uh, now will not change. I guess it was preventing the change there or
5462260	5467140	they will change. They were not changing before. Yeah. Basically this is a bug fix patch and it's
5467140	5472340	nothing, you know, major, major, uh, but it's still nice to see that they are squashing all
5472340	5477220	them bugs because open world games tend to have a lot of them. So we'll see what the fans break
5477220	5482500	next in Zelda tears, the kingdom. All right, let's travel around the world and check out some games
5482500	5486500	you can pick up this week. If you are so inclined, uh, Loki, what's coming out in the U S.
5487060	5495460	So we've got a few things, uh, the valiant on PlayStation five and X-Box series.
5496100	5501780	Mordhau on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, X-Box one and X-Box series.
5502340	5507700	Oxen free two lost signals on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five.
5508660	5516500	Atley, our Maury, uh, remake the alchemist of Solberg on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four
5516500	5524820	and PlayStation five, uh, at zero zombie uprising on PC, PlayStation, five and X-Box series.

5530420	5535580	PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five. Toho
5535600	5540720	new world on PC and Nintendo Switch. And I think that
5540740	5545840	actually a couple more exo primal on PC PlayStation four
5545840	5550040	PlayStation five Xbox one Xbox series, and Jagged Alliance
5550040	5552120	three on PC. That's it.
5552440	5554660	All right, traveling over to Japan we have I don't think we
5554660	5557000	had a lot last week we have some more this week. So on the
5557000	5560400	Nintendo Switch, we have that color cross malice for Nintendo
5560400	5564200	Switch and a special box limited edition is out at layer
5564200	5567900	Marie remake. The Alchemist of Salberg is also out on the
5567900	5570700	switch this week in Japan that is available in a regular
5570780	5573980	premium or special collection box because we love our special
5573980	5578160	editions in Japan. You can also get guña monster is out this
5578160	5581400	week on the switch. Regular limited edition redemption
5581400	5586340	reapers is out as well. To ho Shinsekai longing for an
5586340	5589320	alternative world is out again in three different editions this

5596600	5601360	that's total. Oh, um, yeah, that's the, um, that's a whole
5601360	5606320	big series. Interesting. Okay. Yeah. I don't know if that's a
5606320	5610440	remake or something new. So, um, bloodstained Curse of the Moon
5610440	5614680	Chronicles gets a release in Japan this week on the 13th. And
5614720	5617480	I think that is it for the switch. I'm trying to see if
5617480	5622000	there's anything that creeps into No, it doesn't look like
5622000	5624640	it. Alright, let's look at PlayStation five real quick then
5625000	5628040	and on the PlayStation five we have that same atlier Marie
5628040	5631440	remake the Alchemist of Salberg is out there. guña monster

5657600	5663160	Freddy's security breach on the restaurant the 14th so on PC we
5663160	5668320	have jagged Alliance three on Xbox and PlayStation exo primal
5668640	5676040	and then on switch guess who food in and dying moon. All
5676080	5679480	right. That's it. A few more stories for you and then we'll
5679480	5683080	get to any calls and other questions you all have in our
5683080	5686360	listener roundtable. But first some headlines from Loki.
5686920	5689560	Well, going back to what we were just talking about not that long
5689560	5694240	ago talking about AI voice generation. Well, there's still
5694240	5699520	more controversy because now people are using voices from the
5699520	5705400	voice actors in Skyrim to create dialogue for
5705400	5709520	pornographic mod. Oh, Jesus, that are on a nexus mod. So
5709520	5714040	they're just training it off of the voices in game so they can,
5714080	5716960	you know, have the different characters that they voice in
5716960	5720680	game do pornographic things and have the dialogue to go with it.
5721920	5726440	So, Nexus mod says AI generated mod content is not against our
5726440	5730400	rules but may or be may be removed if we receive credible
5730400	5735240	complaint from an affected creators slash rights holder is
5735280	5740560	nexus mods stance on that. There were some Twitter posts though,
5740720	5746000	basically trying to tag the different voice actors and Zen
5746000	5751040	amax in Bethesda to kind of give them a heads up because they're
5751040	5752760	not really doing anything.
5752800	5755760	Yeah, it should be the other way around. It should be that they
5755760	5758400	can only be published if they have the express consent. It
5758400	5761440	should not be waiting for a lawsuit or a complaint to come
5761440	5765120	in. It should be the other way around. Yeah. So
5766440	5767080	well, that's
5767080	5770640	I'm wondering though, if part of putting that disclaimer in is
5770640	5771440	for
5773720	5778800	ease of control. Because I mean, if you think about the number of
5778800	5782680	mods that go up on Nexus, yeah, daily,
5783000	5784200	no, it's it's it's
5784200	5786120	very well could be a logistic reason.
5786280	5789160	It's a YouTube approach, right? Like, you know, we're not taking
5789160	5791160	it down unless we get a copyright claim, that type of
5791160	5795200	thing. So it's just, but it's it's things like,
5795920	5796880	people should know better.
5796920	5799560	Yeah, it's things like this that are going to get the attention
5799600	5804600	of like, isn't Linda Carter in Skyrim? Or was she in Oblivion?
5804640	5806400	I know Patrick Stewart was in Oblivion, but isn't Linda
5806400	5811920	Carter in Skyrim? Like, if she's one of the voices, the OG
5811920	5816080	Wonder Woman, for those that aren't connected thoughts, I if
5816080	5818520	her voice is one of these, I can't imagine her estates could
5818520	5819480	be very happy about that.
5821720	5822160	Me, she
5823560	5824400	major loss.
5824840	5827400	That's exactly it. That's exactly it. You're already
5827400	5829680	seeing it with the Sarah Silverman thing. It's coming in
5829680	5833960	games to look at for like this situation, just you wait. Misha
5833960	5836160	chat says I saw something recently where Jennifer Hale
5836160	5838680	also stated she didn't want anyone using her voice for that
5838680	5843200	AI stuff either. I would imagine most people don't. And in a
5843280	5848080	certain case by case scenario, they may allow like the de aging
5848080	5852040	thing like you saw with Harrison Ford, who knew that that was
5852040	5855680	going on with the Indiana Jones movie, or you know, the estate
5855680	5857880	of Carrie Fisher when it comes to certain things that happened
5857880	5860760	with Star Wars. But again, that's up to her estate and her
5860880	5863920	heirs and people to control her likeness and all that to decide
5863960	5871040	not for the movie creator, not for the fans to decide. So it's
5871040	5874320	just, yeah. And Dr. Seuss says Yeah, indeed. I've heard quite a
5874320	5877600	few voice actors speaking out against this. It's it's it as
5877600	5879920	we're seeing I mean, and I brought it up earlier in the
5879920	5884600	show too. It's as this gets more and more visibility. It's going
5884600	5888240	to get more and more legal stuff. So just wait, just wait.
5891440	5893920	Let's see Questbuster in chat says Patrick Stewart is in
5893920	5896320	oblivion along with Sean Bean. Yeah, I know that I knew there
5896320	5897040	were some big names.
5897040	5898920	There's Sean Bean die in oblivion as well.
5898920	5901040	Who doesn't? There's some big names.
5901040	5903120	Oh no, it's Sean Bean. That's his thing.
5903960	5907040	Oh, I can't see says Linda Carter's an ESO. Oh, maybe
5907040	5908680	that's it. Maybe that's it.
5908720	5913480	Yeah, they didn't mention any of those people in here. They had
5914520	5919760	it's like about 15 different names on here. Or 18 different
5919760	5922280	names, it looks like. But none of them.
5923360	5927240	And SSJ 100 Mac is a great example of when permission is
5927240	5931040	granted. As she says some actors like James Earl Jones
5931080	5934800	approved their likeness and voice to be used via AI or deep
5934800	5938280	fake stuff. So James Earl Jones said, Yeah, if you want to keep
5938280	5940880	like, you know, because he's getting kind of old and probably
5940880	5944280	can't do the voice the same way used to. So yeah, he gave
5944280	5947280	permission. If they want to keep doing Darth Vader, they can use
5947280	5950240	the technology to make it happen. But he gave permission.
5950400	5954960	That's it. It's as simple as that. So yeah, he's he's in his
5954960	5958400	90s now. It's not like even if he could do the voice, I don't
5958520	5961960	well, but then you think about like, God, when when did June
5961960	5965000	for a do magical dispel like that was she was in her 90s when
5965000	5967200	that DuckTales reimagined came out. So
5967480	5972960	oh, yeah. I mean, she she didn't stop until Yeah, her body gave
5972960	5977240	out. But everybody's got their comfort. He was amazing. Yeah.
5977280	5981440	And you know, we don't know. I hope and I wish that James Earl
5981440	5984840	Jones is an excellent health. But I can't say that I know for
5984840	5988040	sure that that is the case. So maybe he gets to a point where
5988040	5994040	he can't Carol kept doing things too. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So all
5994040	5998880	right. Moving on dark soccer, I guess finally, some closure of
5998880	6001720	sorts on this story that came up a bunch over the last year.
6002400	6010600	So um, so of course, um, as we know, Yuji Naka had been caught
6010600	6018960	again for insider trading. But the judge Hirota Madoka had
6020080	6025000	decided on a suspended two and a half year prison sentence
6025040	6029800	deferred for four years. And there are also two fines that
6029800	6037240	are equivalent of 1.1 million and $14,000 respectively. And
6037240	6042560	that his actions hurt the quote fairness and soundness of the
6042560	6046440	stock market while wounding investor trust. He did plead
6046440	6049680	guilty for violating Japan's financial instruments and
6049680	6054600	exchange act. And we don't really need to go over you know,
6054640	6061800	what he did again. Also, though, Sasaki Taisuke and Suzuki
6061800	6067840	Fumiaki were also arrested for the same thing. But yeah, that's
6067840	6071720	also Square Enix was working with investigators to try to
6071720	6077280	catch people. But, you know, Yuji Naka, very, very, very high
6077280	6087840	profile, and it's looking like even with the suspended sentence,
6088320	6093080	it he may not actually serve real jail time, although two and
6093080	6098200	a half years. That's not a long time. No, it's really not. I
6098200	6101680	have a picture of Dan hanging out with him. Yeah. At E3.
6102000	6106480	Yeah. So it's I don't know why I keep thinking of Martha Stewart.
6106480	6108920	I mean, she didn't do a ton of jail time either. But you know,
6108920	6111560	the whole insider trading thing. It's, um, it's interesting.
6111640	6114000	Well, how many guys know?
6114000	6118080	I know. I know. I'm happy that her brand is really recovered
6118080	6122760	though. Like and name name a better Hollywood pair than
6122760	6124960	Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg. You can't.
6124960	6130920	I was just you can't you can't. And the thing is, is that, like
6130920	6135360	for for her, she turned this shitty experience into sort of a
6135360	6139000	money making parody event that and that's that's how you stick
6139000	6139680	it to the man.
6140520	6143920	But you know, the also the legal system in Japan is quite a bit
6143920	6147800	different. I mean, basically, you have to prove you're
6147800	6149760	innocent, not be proven guilty.
6149800	6152640	Yeah, it isn't the fairest comparison. But it's the you
6152640	6154320	know, the first thing that comes to mind is something a lot of
6154320	6156880	people have heard of that was you know, also insider trading.
6156880	6162840	Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, no insider knowledge needed needed
6162840	6165200	here because this news is everywhere. Loki.
6165200	6173000	Yep. Game Pass Ultimate. The $1 deal is back. So you can now
6173000	6177000	get that, which is pretty awesome. It's $1 for the first
6177000	6180000	month. $17 for every month after that, unfortunately. But at
6180000	6182000	least you get one month for $1.
6184640	6185720	They want to get you hooked.
6186200	6189520	It's Yeah, I gotta gotta get you hooked. It's Yeah, for first
6189520	6192000	time users, of course. That's right. So.
6192000	6198960	All right. Um, well, lastly, but not leastly tonight, I have
6198960	6202280	a, I have a story about the Atari VCS. That's right.
6202320	6206280	Remember, remember that. So let's talk about that. So Atari
6206280	6210080	is teaming up with a company called play magic, which I play
6210080	6213760	magic play magic, which I have not heard of, with something
6213760	6218160	called the poly mega, which I have also not heard of.
6218160	6222480	But apparently what this whole thing does, so sorry, I'm having
6222480	6225680	a hard time getting this page to load here.
6227280	6228640	I'm sorry, this is awkward.
6231280	6234880	Okay, so what this is trying to do is that they're creating
6235040	6237440	hardware and software integration between the poly
6237440	6242720	mega, which is a disk supported system that plays ps one Sega
6242720	6247680	Saturn Sega CD Turbo, which is a very, very popular system that
6247680	6251760	plays CD Turbographic CD and Neo Geo CD games. It's all these
6251760	6256640	systems as their, you know, copyrights and trademarks on the
6256640	6259040	internal hardware technology, because I think they only last
6259040	6262560	for 25 years. It's one of these like mega systems that plays all
6262560	6265920	these things, right. And then there's also modules that will
6265920	6270080	let you play cartridge games for the N64 SNES NES Sega Genesis
6270080	6273600	Turbo graphics, again, a bunch of systems that you know, the
6274240	6279280	stuff has expired some time ago. But the poly mega uses top tier
6279280	6283760	emulation. And apparently it's only 90% compatibility though.
6283760	6286960	So that's kind of interesting, but it will also load fan made
6286960	6291280	patches to do HD graphics or translations or maybe fix some
6291280	6294160	of these games. So it's kind of interesting. So if you're
6294160	6296640	looking for a consolidated platform, this will now
6296640	6301280	integrate with the Atari VCS. The Atari VCS will add support
6301280	6304880	for the poly mega app and the poly mega remix add on. And so
6304880	6307280	that means all of the functionality of a poly mega
6307280	6311040	poly mega will come to Atari VCS owners. And in exchange, I
6311040	6316240	believe the poly mega is getting some type of official Atari
6316240	6319120	support with some of the Atari backlog of games that you know,
6319120	6323520	come out all the time. So interesting, I guess, but you
6323520	6325840	know, if you're like Dark Soccer and just own all the retro
6325840	6328320	systems, you're probably like meh. But if you're somebody
6328320	6331280	that's maybe exploring retro, you know, trying to build up a
6331280	6333280	catalog, this might be of interest to you. Because you
6333280	6336160	know, that's a heck of a lot of systems that this poly mega
6336160	6339600	thing supports. But I'm not surprised. I mean, I feel like
6339600	6342640	just five years ago, we were talking about like five in one,
6343200	6346080	six in one, like these retron things, right, that just have
6346080	6348160	all these cartridge slots. And now we're just seeing that
6348160	6353520	expand to now the CD systems that the technology patents are
6353520	6356160	lapsing and all this other stuff. So interesting.
6356560	6359040	Dr. See, he says, I don't know if the VCS has a disk drive. I
6359040	6360800	wonder how that's all going to work. I was kind of wondering
6360800	6364960	that too. Like, do you but maybe if you hook it up to the actual
6364960	6368640	poly mega, you can read it, but then I don't know why you just
6368640	6371040	wouldn't play it off the poly mega. I don't know. Maybe it's
6371040	6374400	because you can do the patching through the Atari VCS. I don't
6374400	6379520	know. SG100 Matt in chat says kind of on topic. I wonder how
6379520	6383520	ant stream is doing. They're still in business. I get emails
6383520	6387200	I get emails from them. I will admit I am no longer a member.
6387840	6390720	After my Kickstarter period expired, I kind of let it lapse.
6390720	6393680	I wasn't really using it enough. But they I do get emails from
6393680	6396960	them every now and again, that they like to announce like new
6396960	6399280	games that they add to their service and things like that. So
6399280	6405920	they're still chugging along. But I never really saw like them.
6405920	6409040	I think the bummer about ant stream for me is that they never
6409040	6412880	released to this day an Xbox series app as far as that maybe
6412880	6415680	one came out and I missed it and that's completely possible.
6415680	6418560	And maybe I need to reevaluate if that's the case. But yeah.
6421440	6424800	Let's see. I was trying to see if I can actually a lot of
6424800	6428880	tournaments are what I'm seeing from ant stream lately. So they
6428880	6431840	do a lot of weekend tournaments and guides and things like that.
6431840	6437680	I'm not seeing a lot of new games. I have to dig through
6437680	6442400	their emails to see. But they're still around. I got a marketing
6442400	6445200	email from them on June 2. So they probably send things on the
6445200	6447280	first of the month or something like that, or first week of the
6447280	6451680	month or something like that. Dr. Cs says I think ant stream
6451680	6454880	is on the VCS. I'll have to log in again one of these days. I
6454880	6457360	believe yes, they did have a partnership with ant stream on
6457360	6460400	the VCS. Because I believe that's the only way you can play
6460400	6463440	certain Atari games through ant stream is on the VCS. I think
6463440	6466640	you get the entire catalog unlocked. If you are playing
6466640	6470800	through the VCS. Whereas folks not on the VCS have a limited
6470800	6474720	catalog or something like that. So but I know like Crystal
6474720	6476400	Castles is one of the tournaments they were just
6476400	6480160	promoting in their latest email. So they do have Atari games in
6480160	6482960	their collection. But you know, I talked about this game last
6482960	6486800	week. Atari 50 is a really decent collection of not just
6486800	6493360	2600 games, but like 70 like your 5200 7800 Jaguar like it
6493360	6495600	has a little bit of everything which is kind of neat arcade and
6495600	6500800	all that stuff. So kind of neat. All right, well, with
6500800	6504400	that, we will go to you all if you have any other if you have
6504400	6507440	any other random thoughts like sj 100. Matt has or questions
6507440	6511040	for us, please go ahead and voice those in chat. I'll also
6511040	6514160	check in on the mailbag. I don't think there was anything but
6514160	6518400	yeah, there was Oh, then I will go to participate at orange
6518400	6521280	lounge rated calm is the place to send us an email. Oh, yeah,
6521280	6523520	that's right. Because somebody had said in Discord, which by
6523520	6526240	the way is at vog network.com slash Discord, somebody had
6526240	6528880	said in there, did you close your mailbag and they were I
6528880	6531600	think they were still sending it to the old old old address. So
6531600	6534400	the the correct address again is participate at orange
6534400	6540560	entree.com. Go for it. Well, okay, so really vicious too.
6540560	6543760	And one is from red entertainment. Hello, people. So
6543760	6548560	I'm on threads. Now what? Stay care of entertainment. Okay,
6548560	6555360	short and sweet. Congrats. threads. Interesting. Um, you
6555360	6559040	know what? Obviously, I'm in support of anything that knocks
6559040	6562560	Twitter down specific. Well, specifically, Elon Musk down a
6562560	6566800	few pegs. Clearly not supporting Zuckerberg. Yeah, clearly,
6566800	6570400	that's what this threads thing is doing. So in that I'm in
6570400	6574000	support. But as dark soccer is referencing there, I completely
6574000	6577680	understands people reservation with meta. And all that Oh, we
6577680	6580800	just lost Loki. That's weird. I wonder if he lost internet at
6580800	6582720	his house or something that doesn't know. There we go.
6583440	6587440	That was a weird hiccup. Yeah, things happen. Um, but um,
6588480	6593680	anyway, where was I sorry. Um, uh, oh, with the social media.
6593680	6596720	So I completely understand the reservations about, you know,
6596720	6601120	meta and all that stuff. This is why I I personally am enjoying
6601120	6605200	blue sky the most. But I also understand you have to have an
6605200	6608080	invite to get on blue sky and they are still a little bit hard
6608080	6613200	to come by. So yeah, you got to wait patiently handed out mine.
6614160	6620720	You get one every two weeks. Also just FYI, if you are on Mac
6620720	6626320	with an M series chip, you can run the blue sky app on your on
6626320	6630080	your system. Just the one thing is don't push any of your own
6630080	6632400	artwork on there if you don't want it to be used by AI.
6633360	6636720	Hmm. Oh, because with the open platform stuff. Yeah.
6639840	6644080	Uh, yeah. So, uh, yeah, I really enjoy blue sky personally,
6644080	6647520	because I think this is what here it is, when you put blue
6647520	6651840	sky next to threads, like I'm on threads, if you if you want to
6651840	6655200	follow me and Mr. Rob Roberts, I feel like it's a very similar
6655200	6661120	situation to me for Twitter, is that I have to be there. Because
6661120	6665200	if I'm not there, I'm not able to promote myself, which I know
6665200	6669120	sounds really good. But the reality is, well, yeah, we all
6669120	6671840	know it dark soccer promoting her twitch Loki promoting
6671840	6676000	YouTube, me promoting a little bit of Twitch and the stuff I do
6676000	6678800	IRL with hosting shows like the killer clowns thing we did
6678800	6681040	yesterday. Are you a fan of killer clowns? Loki? Because I
6681040	6684880	noticed you liking a bunch of course I should have had you
6684880	6689120	come to the show. So I considered it but I had the kids
6689200	6692960	and my wife was gone. It's like, it's a huge like schlocky
6692960	6695920	cinema cult hit though. So I mean, they say anything about
6695920	6699440	the upcoming game coming out. I was not able to stay for all of
6699440	6702640	john masari concert, but he apparently had footage from the
6702640	6707760	game in his concert that he was teasing. And they did say I did
6707760	6712960	ask a question about, you know, if people want to support the
6712960	6715760	sequel for killer clowns, you know, they want to see another
6715760	6718800	one made, how can they support and a lot of them were like, you
6718800	6721120	know, of course, it's about showing the money and the game
6721120	6723680	is going to be a huge indicator of that. So please buy and
6723680	6725840	support the game if you can was like a big thing they were
6725840	6728880	talking about. So with that, so
6730960	6734080	there's one other email. Oh, yes, go ahead. And it was just
6734080	6738240	Brad sending me cats. Oh, no video game chatter for me
6738240	6741280	tonight. But a while back, Jamie had put out the call for
6741280	6744720	pictures of listener cats. So attached to four picks when
6744720	6747840	each of my three kitties rose FEMA and the late great Clara
6747840	6750880	Jane. And the fourth is Amelia formerly my kitty but now
6750880	6753280	living the good life with another vogue supporter Sia
6753280	6755920	Tabiri. Hope y'all have a great show Brad.
6756880	6761360	I've I always have time for pictures with cats. Pictures of
6761360	6766560	cats. I have pictures of your cats. You do you have cheddar
6766560	6768960	or do I need to still send you chatter? I need more any
6768960	6771600	pictures of cheddar. Okay. I think I have like a couple that
6771600	6774640	I took but I have to find them. Okay. I can take care of that.
6775520	6780800	Yeah, sweet. All right. Um, well, with that, I guess we're
6780800	6787200	not really getting a lot of calls tonight. So I guess we'll
6787200	6789760	just send you a message. Yeah, I used to say I guess we'll
6789760	6792720	just kind of start to wrap up. So Jamie, if you have some
6792720	6795760	stuff you got to do, then I should let you go now. So do you
6795760	6800000	have any final thoughts for our listeners? Um, I'm actually
6800000	6802720	going to bust out my vtuber tonight. We'll see if it works.
6803280	6807920	All right, have fun. Good luck. Later tater. All right. All
6807920	6811200	right. Well, as I usually say here at the end of the show,

6836880	6840400	us a nice five star review. It goes an awful long way. Tell a
6840400	6843200	friend share a social media link. You can share it on
6843200	6845920	threads for all I care. That would be that would be lovely
6845920	6849920	wherever you want to promote the show. Super appreciate that
6849920	6852720	more Twitch follows are a great thing too. Thanks again for our
6852720	6857440	500th follow tonight. That's exciting to see. Um, so I think
6857440	6860400	we can get final thoughts now. So Loki your final thoughts
6860400	6864560	tonight? I was gonna say that I didn't check last minute
6864560	6870320	stories. Do you have stories? No, not really. Um, so I was
6870320	6874880	gonna say that threads algorithm right now sucks. There's no way
6874880	6877920	to filter out big people that you're not following. Which
6877920	6880480	sucks. Oh, yeah, we did kind of shift up that quickly. We I
6880480	6884000	would just say, um, yeah, the algorithm thing is shitty. It's
6884000	6887280	the same thing they do with Instagram, though. And I
6887280	6890960	remember when they shifted that and Instagram kind of and
6890960	6894640	seeing that threads is very clearly built on Instagram. And
6894640	6897840	I think they've even said like threads is basically
6897840	6901520	Instagram's code. Um, but you know, obviously reworked for
6901520	6904080	what they're doing there. Well, they used to have I think
6904080	6906800	threads used to be a thing they discontinued it like several
6906800	6909760	years ago, then they brought it back because Twitter was
6909760	6913200	sucking. Yeah, there was an article I thought about that
6913200	6915920	they showed that like, Oh, yeah, we're just continuing threads.
6915920	6918960	That's like from 2019 or something like that. Or 2020. I
6918960	6922880	remember. I didn't know it was ever around. Yeah, the the lack
6922880	6925280	of algorithm sucks. But and I never did get to say this
6925280	6929680	before. That to me is the strongest part of blue sky.
6929680	6932560	It's not just the fact that you know, it's it's Twitter without
6932560	6935920	Elon. But it's the the part that's really great about it is
6935920	6940400	that the algorithms you have custom algorithms, and you can
6940400	6943600	create your own algorithm. So and other people make
6943600	6946800	algorithms. So for example, there's an algorithm out there
6946800	6951280	called queer streamers. And I got added to it. So all my posts
6951280	6953920	show up in this particular feed. And you can add whatever
6953920	6957520	feeds you want. But it's not just like, a lot of them are
6957520	6959680	user base. Like I know there's another really popular one
6959680	6965680	called black sky, which is the by POC users of blue sky that
6965680	6968480	are like on their algorithm, but it's not just ones that are
6968480	6973440	user based. There are ones where it's like this algorithm
6973440	6977200	will show you posts of cat pictures only, at least that the
6977200	6980880	algorithm can identify. And it says some other animals sneak in
6980880	6983280	here too, because you know, we're still perfecting the cat
6983280	6987520	detection technology. So there are other ways to like see the
6987520	6992560	algorithms and it is really powerful. And I think and it's
6992560	6995920	a huge contrast between blue sky and threads, right? Because
6995920	6998480	threads is shoving the Instagram algorithm down our
6998480	7000960	throat. And a lot of us are like, we don't want to do
7000960	7003040	written social media like this. Like it's one thing for
7003040	7005360	pictures. It's another for trying to stay on top of what my
7005360	7009200	friends are saying. But the blue sky and the custom algorithms
7009200	7013440	and like, hey, you make your own algorithm. Or or if you
7013440	7015680	want, we'll just show you everything chronologically.
7016240	7019040	Cool. Like I think that's exactly what people want. So
7019040	7021200	it's great. And yeah, I see I see.
7021200	7023600	I just have to mute everybody is what I've been trying to do.
7023680	7026720	But it's it's been a lot. It's because you know, it's like, oh,
7026720	7029520	here's the NBA and WWE and something like that. I'm not
7029520	7032160	following these. I don't care. Yeah, I don't care about like
7032160	7035760	what this local sports team is doing. Like, and it's been like,
7035760	7038720	I wish it was there was a way it's like, okay, prioritize the
7038720	7041440	people that you follow first so that you could see their posts.
7041440	7043600	It's just a mix. It's just a mess.
7044720	7048640	Um, and well, the nice thing about blue sky again, not to,
7048640	7050880	you know, shout out for the rooftops, but I am enjoying it.
7050880	7053280	So I am gonna say and I see many of you in chat going, I
7053280	7056160	wish I get in by wishing an invite. I know if I had a
7056160	7058720	million of them, I'd love to hand them out. The reality is
7058720	7063280	users on blue sky get one invite one invite every two weeks.
7063840	7067040	So that's why if it's and I there that list that y'all
7067040	7069600	signed up on, I don't think it's doing shit. I don't think
7069600	7072560	we'll do anything until blue sky goes public, which you know,
7072560	7075120	they're still they're still developing blue sky. And the
7075120	7079040	problem is like that day that Elon banned the word sis or
7079040	7082560	whatever stupid shit he came up with this week, like blue sky
7082560	7085440	went down because of all the increased traffic and interest
7085440	7088640	and you know, people so like blue sky, like they're trying
7088640	7091920	to prevent a hive social situation. For those that
7091920	7094480	remember when everybody fled Twitter to hive social for a
7094480	7097680	week, and then hive just absolutely shit the bed with a
7097680	7100960	security issue, and had to like shut down the app and never
7100960	7104160	recovered, basically. I mean, yeah, it's back up, technically,
7104160	7108160	but on a engagement base, it never recovered. So and yeah,
7108160	7110080	mastodon, of course, is an option, too. I don't mean to
7110080	7114720	neglect that. But yeah, that's that's why the invites are slow
7114720	7119120	to roll out. Because in some ways, it's still not ready. So
7119120	7122400	they just they need, you know, time to work that all out. So
7123520	7128000	yeah, but at the same time with one invite every two weeks, it
7128000	7131040	will it will pyramid its way down to you eventually. It's
7131040	7136240	just very slow going. So but yeah, I get invites once in a
7136240	7139040	while, too. And you know, I've been trying to invite people,
7139040	7143200	you know, as I see them, but yeah, it's local. I let me put
7143200	7150320	it this way. I haven't even invited Alan yet, so should
7150320	7154160	show you that there. So. All right. I think that's enough
7154160	7156400	discussion about social media stuff. We really probably should
7156400	7160240	wrap up the show. So I think we got your final thought, Loki. So
7160240	7165600	my final thought is Final Fantasy 16. I want to beat it
7165600	7168720	this week. I hope I have the time and energy to do it because
7168720	7171280	work's been very busy, but I'm hoping this week it starts to
7171840	7175680	back off a little bit and I am able to sign out of work after
7175680	7180000	eight hours instead of 11. All right. That's it, everybody.
7180000	7182720	Have a wonderful night. We will see you next time on Orange
7182720	7185040	Lounge Radio. Have a great week gaming. We'll see you in seven
