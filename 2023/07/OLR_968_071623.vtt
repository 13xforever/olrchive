00:00.000 --> 00:13.280
What do Orange is the New Black and Genshin Impact have in common?

00:13.280 --> 00:16.900
They made their rights holders billions of dollars and their creative cast a pittance.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.140
One of them was unionized with insufficient contract terms for a new medium.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.380
The other is non-union.

00:21.380 --> 00:24.280
Both of them have financially struggling independent contributors.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.780
Today in America, the Writers Guild continues to strike, the Screen Actors Guild now on

00:27.980 --> 00:31.360
numerous gaming and other firms unionizing or unionized and the people are making long

00:31.360 --> 00:32.880
overdue needs happen.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.500
This is the Collective Bargaining Headline.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.620
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:37.620 --> 00:40.660
the gaming side of this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on

00:40.660 --> 00:43.700
the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:43.700 --> 00:48.380
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:48.380 --> 00:53.840
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.860
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:55.860 --> 01:02.420
We're live once again, episode number 968 of our show for tonight, July the 16th of

01:02.420 --> 01:04.020
2023.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.140
It's a very hot night.

01:06.140 --> 01:09.740
I think in most parts of the country, but especially where we're based here in Northern

01:09.740 --> 01:10.740
California.

01:10.740 --> 01:16.900
Me, I'm Rob Roberts, and I am joined every week over the last 21 plus years with my co-hosts.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.060
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.060 --> 01:21.060
Hi.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.060
Hi.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.940
Now, Jamie, it is so hot outside.

01:23.940 --> 01:25.840
Why are you hanging out by a campfire?

01:25.840 --> 01:28.420
That's what I want to know.

01:28.420 --> 01:32.320
And pretending that it's a cold night that requires the campfire.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.320
Okay.

01:33.320 --> 01:37.920
Although my mic, you see where my mic clips in?

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
Yeah.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
Technology.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.440
So the problem is that anything that's kind of white is actually what's trying to show

01:44.440 --> 01:53.480
through my background thing, and this application isn't robust enough to have different balance

01:53.480 --> 01:54.480
detection.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.480
So yeah.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
All good.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.480
All good.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.560
And also joining us with the green screen effect tonight.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.320
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.320
Hello.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.320
Hi, Loki.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.320
How are you?

02:06.320 --> 02:07.320
Pretty good.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
Good.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.400
You playing DDR in the garage in this heat?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.160
Not this year.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.160
Not this year.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.160
Okay.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.160
I see.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.160
I see.

02:16.160 --> 02:19.020
Yes, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific,

02:19.020 --> 02:23.640
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.640
That's vognetwork.com.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.980
Also, of course, on Twitch at vognetwork.

02:26.980 --> 02:31.420
And yeah, Bobby Black Wolf is actually in chat and points out the arcade is off.

02:31.420 --> 02:37.740
Yes, I did intentionally turn it off tonight just to save that little bit of extra energy.

02:37.740 --> 02:43.340
It is 108 degrees today, which is at least what the weather app said last I opened it,

02:43.340 --> 02:45.700
but it is a very, very, very high temperature.

02:45.700 --> 02:51.020
And although I'm feeling okay, like the AC is on full blast, I just every little bit,

02:51.020 --> 02:55.700
and I don't think these things generate a lot of heat, any little bit of heat, I'm turning

02:55.700 --> 02:56.700
it off tonight.

02:56.700 --> 03:01.060
So I'm sure you can understand why we don't have the ambiance of Tron and Burger Time

03:01.060 --> 03:05.300
running in the background tonight, which are the two arcade machines that I have in my

03:05.300 --> 03:06.640
office.

03:06.640 --> 03:13.220
For now, I'm always looking at like, oh, I have this very obvious empty space between

03:13.220 --> 03:14.220
the couch.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.220
Hmm.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.460
Anyway, we'll see what comes, we'll see.

03:19.460 --> 03:24.300
So we're going to jump into our first topic tonight in gaming news.

03:24.300 --> 03:28.860
And this has been what a lot of people have been talking about as this gets closer and

03:28.860 --> 03:29.860
closer to reality.

03:29.860 --> 03:34.220
Loki, do you want to kick us off with the latest and greatest on what is going on with

03:34.220 --> 03:39.860
the Activision Microsoft merger and how the finish line I think is in sight?

03:39.860 --> 03:42.140
Yeah, we're getting there.

03:42.140 --> 03:50.220
So the FTC had a lawsuit that was out to try to stop it was basically an injunction

03:50.220 --> 03:56.540
to stop the merger while they have their own like, I guess there's another court case that's

03:56.540 --> 03:57.540
going on.

03:57.540 --> 03:59.720
That's not until August, though.

03:59.720 --> 04:05.900
But they're trying to basically force the merger from going through.

04:05.900 --> 04:09.300
And that unfortunately failed in the courts.

04:09.300 --> 04:15.240
And so in the United States, there's not really anything kind of stopping them now.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.580
So that's good, at least.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.840
So now we have to just wait, I guess, to whenever their next court date is, which I think is

04:24.840 --> 04:25.840
in August.

04:25.840 --> 04:33.060
But I know that Microsoft had basically a deadline that they had to meet in order to

04:33.060 --> 04:36.540
avoid paying penalties.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.740
But I mean, it's, I guess supposed to be going through.

04:39.740 --> 04:46.380
Along with that, though, you know, they did make a deal as well with PlayStation to guarantee

04:46.380 --> 04:50.880
that Call of Duty is going to appear on their platform, which I know was a major contention

04:50.880 --> 04:57.020
point for at least I think the FTC and even I think in the UK regulators as well.

04:57.020 --> 04:59.820
So be kind of curious to see what's going to happen with that because I don't think

04:59.820 --> 05:05.260
they've ever resolved the whole UK thing as well.

05:05.260 --> 05:11.220
So yeah, it's just right now figuring out what the UK the CMA is going to do.

05:11.220 --> 05:18.100
And now that these new kind of events have happened, you know, especially with the deal

05:18.100 --> 05:23.380
in Call of Duty, does that mean that Sony is not going to be pushing against it now

05:23.380 --> 05:25.620
because they got kind of what they wanted?

05:25.620 --> 05:32.420
Or are they going to try to, you know, there's nothing left to push against Sony's out of

05:32.420 --> 05:33.420
options.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.380
They tried their best to stop the deal.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.700
It didn't work.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.700
They're out of options.

05:37.700 --> 05:42.540
In fact, my understanding is at least what's coming through is that now what Sony is ultimately

05:42.540 --> 05:46.980
had to sign here is not as good as what they were offered before.

05:46.980 --> 05:54.440
They were offered before all of this the offer to have all Activision games on their platforms

05:54.440 --> 05:56.260
for five more years.

05:56.260 --> 05:57.420
That's not what got signed.

05:57.420 --> 06:01.640
What got signed was Call of Duty for more years.

06:01.640 --> 06:07.620
So they're going to lose the other Activision titles like, you know, maybe on a case by

06:07.620 --> 06:08.680
case basis.

06:08.680 --> 06:13.280
But I think we all should be prepared for they're going to lose things like if there's

06:13.280 --> 06:20.120
ever an Overwatch three potentially, you know, things like that, Diablo updates and things

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
like that.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.640
I don't know if Sony would or excuse me, if Microsoft would withhold all of that.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.340
I don't think it's in their best interest to withhold things like Overwatch three or

06:27.340 --> 06:30.120
Diablo four expansions and so forth.

06:30.120 --> 06:35.400
But it's there are going to be big games that Activision releases that do not come

06:35.400 --> 06:38.320
to Sony now.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.040
And that's that's that's the cost to do in business, I guess.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.040
Yeah.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.040
And the CMA said that, you know, Microsoft and Activision have indicated that they are

06:45.040 --> 06:50.640
considering how the transaction might be modified and the CMA is prepared to engage with them

06:50.640 --> 06:52.360
on this basis.

06:52.360 --> 06:57.820
And seeing as that the agreements already been modified and Sony's basically agreed

06:57.820 --> 06:58.980
to something.

06:58.980 --> 07:03.780
So I'm wondering if that then changes what's going on with this.

07:03.780 --> 07:08.740
But we'll just have to wait and see what happens.

07:08.740 --> 07:15.220
But yeah, next week's gonna be interesting.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.220
Yes it is.

07:16.220 --> 07:23.400
I'll be very curious to see what happens with what happens overseas and how I mean, because

07:23.400 --> 07:26.720
they're trying to close that deal on Tuesday.

07:26.720 --> 07:31.900
So if we don't hear an excuse me an announcement tomorrow, because keep in mind, everything

07:31.900 --> 07:34.640
overseas is about eight hours ahead of us.

07:34.640 --> 07:39.780
So if we don't hear something tomorrow, I don't know what happens at that point.

07:39.780 --> 07:46.180
You know, we've we've heard talk about that Microsoft could just pluck their entire operations

07:46.180 --> 07:50.940
out of the UK or out of Yeah, out of the areas that are where they could do that temporarily

07:50.940 --> 07:54.900
to until they get you know, you know, everything situated.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.700
Yeah, it'll be very interesting.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.800
Interesting to see what happens with that for sure.

07:59.800 --> 08:04.120
We'll just get Konami to publish those titles, you know, like, they didn't know the region.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.240
So that's fine.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.940
Tiger Claw on chat says Sony needs a Call of Duty killer, but in the past, they had

08:08.940 --> 08:16.120
games like it, but they weren't as good Well, you know, here's reality check for many gamers

08:16.120 --> 08:19.680
out there, not necessarily the ones here listening to this show, but I want I need to give a

08:19.680 --> 08:23.060
reality check to a lot of people out there.

08:23.060 --> 08:28.400
For those of you that have said for years and years and years, I don't, I don't buy

08:28.400 --> 08:31.200
into Xbox, Microsoft, I don't buy into them.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.280
They don't have any exclusives.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.960
I like they don't they don't have anything I like I halo halos overrated, Microsoft doesn't

08:36.960 --> 08:37.960
have anything.

08:37.960 --> 08:38.960
No.

08:38.960 --> 08:39.960
Congratulations.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
Congratulations.

08:40.960 --> 08:45.200
This mergers for you.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.420
You did it.

08:46.420 --> 08:47.480
You did it.

08:47.480 --> 08:51.680
Now it's going to be a lot harder to say that, isn't it?

08:51.680 --> 08:54.840
Moving forward that Microsoft I mean, this, of course, I'll be people that still say it.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.700
That's you know, how it is some people have to be right all the time.

08:58.700 --> 09:06.180
But the reality is Microsoft just bagged a lot more diverse exclusives through this deal.

09:06.180 --> 09:11.720
And all of you that have been banging the drum saying, I don't buy Microsoft products

09:11.720 --> 09:15.640
because they don't have good exclusives.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.180
Congrats you played yourself.

09:18.180 --> 09:20.340
Yeah.

09:20.340 --> 09:25.360
And it's it's kind of silly the whole console worse thing anyways, because like, if you

09:25.360 --> 09:28.920
just if you just play on PC, you're really eating good.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.880
So like, I don't know.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.360
I don't know it.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.360
It's silly.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.180
It's also like, look, and I'm not I'm certainly not anti Sony by any means.

09:37.180 --> 09:38.240
I think you all know by now.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.840
I love all the gaming companies.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.000
I'm critical of all the gaming companies when it's deserved as well.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.140
That's how that's how we work here at Orange Daunt Radio critical that you love.

09:46.140 --> 09:47.140
That's right.

09:47.140 --> 09:48.140
Absolutely.

09:48.140 --> 09:55.640
So don't, don't sit here and feel sorry for Sony, because they have plenty of must have

09:55.640 --> 09:56.640
exclusives.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.280
You don't hear people even in the Microsoft camp, you don't really hear I mean, there's

10:00.280 --> 10:05.080
always these extreme people, but you for the most part, do not hear people saying oh, Sony

10:05.080 --> 10:06.560
doesn't have any exclusives.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
That's why I don't play PlayStation.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.040
So I don't have any exclusives.

10:09.040 --> 10:14.920
You know, Sony has plenty of exclusives between the God of Wars, The Last of Us is that there's

10:14.920 --> 10:16.920
plenty of things that Sony has.

10:16.920 --> 10:23.500
And you know, there's obviously a lot of that chatter about well, how is Sony going to counterpunch

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
this?

10:24.500 --> 10:25.780
Are they going to buy Square Enix?

10:25.780 --> 10:28.420
Are they going to buy insert company here?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.300
What's the counterplay here?

10:30.300 --> 10:31.780
To get more exclusives?

10:31.780 --> 10:35.620
Honestly, I just don't want I don't want to see any more consolidation.

10:35.620 --> 10:39.220
Really the only reason I wanted Microsoft to buy Activision is to get rid of Bobby

10:39.220 --> 10:40.220
Kotick.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.220
Yeah, I'm 100%.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.220
That's that's really it.

10:42.220 --> 10:49.080
I don't like the idea of more consolidation because that worked well in the cable industry

10:49.080 --> 10:53.600
and the internet industry and all that stuff like it doesn't it's not great.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.320
Like they're not evil right now.

10:57.320 --> 11:02.120
But like if they have a big majority, then there's nothing really stopping them from

11:02.120 --> 11:04.000
just manipulating the whole market.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.920
So it's, I don't know, it's not necessarily like a huge win to see them like, take Activision

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
Blizzard.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.900
Yeah, I just want Bobby Kotick out because he's just awful.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.180
But 100% I'm with you.

11:16.180 --> 11:19.860
I've never liked the big fish eating big fish merge.

11:19.860 --> 11:26.540
But unfortunately, this specific merger has another more important component.

11:26.540 --> 11:29.400
And that is the removal of Bobby Kotick from the industry.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.220
And yes, I know he stands to make a disgusting amount of money from this deal.

11:33.220 --> 11:34.220
I do.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.820
He makes a disgusting amount of money from everything.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.780
Well, I hope he is sued, quite frankly, by some of the people that were formerly employed

11:39.780 --> 11:41.820
by him to recoup some of that money.

11:42.560 --> 11:48.040
That is a whole other issue when and hopefully that occurs is he owes some of that money

11:48.040 --> 11:52.000
back to a lot of the people that he's heard over the years, but that is neither here nor

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
there.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.960
The important part is, he won't be in this industry anymore.

11:55.960 --> 12:00.520
And he can fuck right off to some desert island after this and enjoy spending all that money

12:00.520 --> 12:07.440
on getting himself fanned and, you know, cocaine every weekend, if that's what he wants, to

12:07.440 --> 12:08.440
be quite frankly.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.640
But I just stay out of this industry.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.140
He's done no good for it.

12:13.140 --> 12:18.140
Let's see, going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

12:18.140 --> 12:21.860
Dejirama S says, what's interesting about is that among the people I know who have been

12:21.860 --> 12:27.060
following this merger, 99% of those people don't give a damn about Kotick.

12:27.060 --> 12:32.540
I mean, that says about those people.

12:32.540 --> 12:33.540
I know.

12:33.540 --> 12:34.900
Yeah, I'm trying to be nice.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.140
But there you go.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.900
I don't need to be nice about it.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.460
That says a lot about those people if they don't care how he's treated his employees.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.360
I can say that some people don't follow the business.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.800
Some people may really truly not know how horrible it is on the inside.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.680
But I hope maybe this merger can be a chance to educate said people.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.680
That's that.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.800
Let's see other comments.

12:56.800 --> 13:01.160
Tiger class says now Microsoft will own quite an extensive library of games Activision is

13:01.160 --> 13:03.120
filled with so much gaming history.

13:03.120 --> 13:10.280
I'm super curious how fast this moves, meaning are we going to get some major games on Game

13:10.300 --> 13:11.820
Pass next week?

13:11.820 --> 13:13.000
Because I could see it.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.620
I could see like assuming everything I could see like next Friday, they fucking throw down

13:17.620 --> 13:21.900
Diablo two remastered Diablo three on Game Pass.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.820
I could see it if not Diablo four.

13:23.820 --> 13:28.080
I think I think that might be a little bit too wishful thinking.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.540
But I could see that some of the Activision backlog is going to get added to Game Pass

13:31.540 --> 13:39.020
real quick, which will be very exciting, especially because breaking news alert.

13:39.040 --> 13:45.080
Apparently, it has just come out that Microsoft intends to change the pricing on Game Pass.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.560
What a what a convenient time.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.080
Well, let me take this back.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.880
We knew they were changing the pricing.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.720
We actually talked about last week or the week before that the price of Xbox is going

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
up.

13:54.720 --> 13:59.680
But now we just learned tonight Xbox Gold is essentially getting replaced with something

13:59.680 --> 14:01.040
called Xbox Core.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.720
They are no longer going to give away monthly games with it.

14:04.720 --> 14:09.820
They're going to have instead of a smaller library of Xbox games.

14:09.820 --> 14:16.580
Like honestly, like honestly, like with the Microsoft giving away games each month, like

14:16.580 --> 14:21.940
I forget half the time that they're doing that because I don't go in there to like because

14:21.940 --> 14:24.140
I don't have a console hooked up, so I don't go in.

14:24.140 --> 14:26.480
The quality has dipped for some years.

14:26.480 --> 14:32.340
I actually think the 25 game library is probably ultimately going to be a better deal.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.340
Yeah.

14:34.960 --> 14:40.040
Because they'll probably be first party Microsoft games in that pack, maybe not the newest of

14:40.040 --> 14:46.280
the new, but like Halo Anniversary Collection, I'm going to I'm going to Rob Stradamus, Halo

14:46.280 --> 14:49.840
Anniversary Collection, one of those 25 games easy.

14:49.840 --> 14:55.080
It's an older title, not selling a lot these days, really good show off of what Microsoft's

14:55.080 --> 14:58.260
got to offer on their variety of consoles.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.040
That's a very, very safe prediction.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.760
But I would say you're going to see first party titles like that will make up those

15:03.760 --> 15:05.360
25 titles.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.500
Forza Horizon, I would bet would go into that too.

15:08.500 --> 15:15.060
Maybe not the latest and greatest one, but I believe three is still up and running, right?

15:15.060 --> 15:17.180
I don't think they pulled the servers for three.

15:17.180 --> 15:21.660
So whichever one they still got the servers on for would be a part of that 25 as well.

15:21.660 --> 15:27.300
So I think it'll probably be a very, very okay, they delisted except for five.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.660
Okay, then four will be up.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.540
Oh, licensing.

15:31.540 --> 15:37.880
So I think that those are all safe battle four is delisted to Wow.

15:37.880 --> 15:38.880
All right.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.760
Well, maybe they do put five in there because five is a year old now.

15:41.760 --> 15:51.380
But anyway, it's gonna be 25 mostly first party Xbox games that will be in that collection.

15:51.380 --> 15:56.400
Maybe a couple third party games that you know, Sony does but you know, now, now that

15:56.400 --> 15:58.760
they have Activision as well.

15:58.760 --> 16:03.560
And you know, Bethesda, like Skyrim, probably in that bundle as well.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.560
But we'll see.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.360
We'll see what comes out for that.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.960
Okay, anything else on the merger to talk about?

16:09.960 --> 16:13.800
No, we'll just wait until this week.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.800
Yeah.

16:14.800 --> 16:20.920
But by the time we do the next orange lounge radio, we should either have a unified Activision,

16:20.920 --> 16:27.780
Microsoft, Blizzard is now all one company or some fuckery overseas has stalled this

16:27.780 --> 16:29.400
whole thing yet again.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.020
So it could be very I'm very curious to see if in a week, we're talking about new game

16:33.020 --> 16:34.020
pass games.

16:34.020 --> 16:37.600
Well, they can't because if they don't go through, they owe $3 billion.

16:37.600 --> 16:43.920
So like, it's, I they will, it will go through there unless it legally cannot go through

16:43.920 --> 16:47.920
if they stop it in the UK, they'll be like, I'll need the UK.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.920
Yeah, I guess that's what happens at that point.

16:49.920 --> 16:50.920
That's true.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
All right.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.960
Okay, well, let's talk a little bit about the things that have been going on in our

16:55.960 --> 16:59.720
gaming weeks, whether they've been Microsoft games or not.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.280
In a segment we call How was your gaming week?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.520
So dark soccer, we'll start with you.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.160
How was your gaming week?

17:05.160 --> 17:08.260
Um, warm.

17:08.260 --> 17:16.000
Actually there was a good bit of playing pinball this weekend, Dan's working on our whitewater.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.680
It ended up being a little bit more of a money sink and we thought it was going to

17:19.680 --> 17:27.760
be excuse me, I played of course, some Dead by Daylight wanted to wrap up the last couple

17:27.760 --> 17:34.000
of things in the anniversary.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.080
So that was that was pretty fun.

17:37.080 --> 17:43.140
I also did my last stream of Marvel's Midnight Suns, I'm going to be going back to retro

17:43.140 --> 17:49.100
games and I'm thinking about starting off with like a few simple games just to demonstrate

17:49.100 --> 17:50.740
what they are.

17:50.740 --> 17:57.780
Before I decide if I want to go back to Star Ocean and pick up where I left off, or if

17:57.780 --> 18:02.160
I want to come back to it later and start on something new, I'm sort of thinking about

18:02.160 --> 18:05.660
Tales of Fantasia.

18:05.660 --> 18:09.140
I've also got Rudranohil on my list.

18:09.140 --> 18:16.380
I have Marvelous Return to Treasure Island on my list, the original Live Alive, Great

18:16.380 --> 18:21.980
Battle 5, there's a there's a few on my list, there's even a Kunio-kun game that's also

18:21.980 --> 18:22.980
on my list.

18:22.980 --> 18:23.980
So we'll see.

18:23.980 --> 18:28.740
Oh, and the original Rayearth RPG for Super Famicom.

18:28.740 --> 18:35.000
So we'll see, I've got a I've got a list, I'll put it up to a vote.

18:35.000 --> 18:42.880
Also, you know, doing my stupid wordscapes and I'm still loving the new Cult of the Lamb

18:42.880 --> 18:46.760
DLC and I finally beat it on stream.

18:46.760 --> 18:52.200
So I'm still gonna like I'm gonna try to think of something else to do for my late Monday

18:52.200 --> 18:57.640
night or, you know, that isn't just going right back to Dead by Daylight.

18:57.640 --> 19:03.660
So if anyone has any suggestions for other things they'd like to see, let me know because

19:03.660 --> 19:09.140
otherwise I might go back to playing virtual pinball.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.140
Awesome.

19:10.140 --> 19:11.140
Yeah.

19:11.140 --> 19:15.840
All right, Loki, we'll go to you, your gaming week.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.840
Let's see.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.260
So Minecraft to start off with.

19:18.260 --> 19:22.860
So I've been working on the stuff for my next episode, which I've gotten a lot of builds

19:22.860 --> 19:26.620
done, but then I realized I need a lot more builds since because I need to finish the

19:26.620 --> 19:31.520
whole interior of the base, the part in the mountain.

19:31.520 --> 19:35.840
So I've been working on that right now and hopefully be done that soon so I can do the

19:35.840 --> 19:39.960
editing because there's going to be lots of editing this episode, the last three episodes.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.480
So down to the final three.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.560
I did play other games though this week.

19:45.560 --> 19:51.960
So we did Channel 64 plays where we all got together and played Among Us, which I've never

19:51.960 --> 19:55.400
played before, funny enough.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.400
So we did that.

19:56.400 --> 20:01.640
Unfortunately, I was I wasn't an imposter the first two rounds, which is not good for

20:01.640 --> 20:05.920
someone that hasn't played the game because, like, I don't know where any of the jobs are

20:05.920 --> 20:06.920
or anything.

20:06.920 --> 20:11.040
So I was like, I don't know what I'm doing.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.800
But yeah, we played a little bit.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.720
I kind of got the hang of it after a little bit.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.280
And then I wasn't an imposter anymore, unfortunately.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.280
Were you a shapeshifter?

20:18.280 --> 20:20.240
Yeah, I was too both times.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.240
Yeah.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.240
But I didn't really know what I was doing.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.240
Yeah.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.240
So it's funny.

20:25.240 --> 20:30.920
One of the advantages of being the shapeshifter is even if you're caught and the the crew

20:30.920 --> 20:32.840
wins, you still win.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.680
Oh, that's funny.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.680
Yeah.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.160
Because then you're converted into a crew ghost.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.400
Yeah.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.800
So what else?

20:41.800 --> 20:46.760
So I played that I played Gravity Circuit, which was a game that we had behind me last

20:46.760 --> 20:47.760
week.

20:47.760 --> 20:52.240
The one that's kind of like, I think it's like Shovel Knight.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.720
It's definitely like Mega Man Ninja Gaiden.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.720
Yeah.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.720
And it plays.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.080
It's set up like a Mega Man type game.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.720
It's pretty hard, actually.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.800
But it's pretty fun.

21:01.800 --> 21:07.320
You kind of your there's like this virus that's taken over all the robots that are in this

21:07.320 --> 21:13.080
area and you've got to go like defeat these old you're part of like this like team of

21:13.080 --> 21:14.560
robots that were defending everything.

21:14.560 --> 21:18.640
Of course, the other ones have corrupted and now they're evil and so you have to go defeat

21:18.640 --> 21:19.640
them and stuff.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.760
But it's pretty fun.

21:20.760 --> 21:21.760
I really like it.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.760
It's kind of fun.

21:22.800 --> 21:29.480
There's elements of Metal Slug in there and Ninja Gaiden and certainly probably Shovel

21:29.480 --> 21:30.480
Knight as well.

21:30.480 --> 21:36.560
I haven't played Shovel Knight yet, even though I have it in my library for like a long time.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.040
But I'm sure it's got kind of all those different elements.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.440
So it's really worth it.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.440
It's a fun game.

21:41.440 --> 21:46.320
I haven't picked I haven't played this yet, but I picked it up this week.

21:46.320 --> 21:52.640
I saw an announcement from Limited Run Games that they are saying that they're going to

21:53.520 --> 21:57.200
do a physical version of Riff Tracks the game like that's out already.

21:57.200 --> 22:02.480
So we so I need to find some people to play that with because I love me some Riff Tracks

22:02.480 --> 22:05.640
in Mr. Sans to your 3000 and that looks like a lot of fun.

22:05.640 --> 22:10.640
It's kind of like a set up like a Jackbox game where you watch a clip and then you add

22:10.640 --> 22:17.920
like a funny, you know, snarky comment to go with it in it in an AI voice reads it for

22:17.920 --> 22:19.180
you during the clip.

22:19.180 --> 22:21.680
So it's like you're doing your own MS3TK.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.960
So it's going to be pretty awesome.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.080
Yeah, I've I've played that on Twitch.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.960
A friend of mine, Troy takes photos, streams that a lot on his Twitch channel.

22:30.960 --> 22:31.960
And I played that once.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.960
It's cute.

22:32.960 --> 22:33.960
It's funny.

22:33.960 --> 22:34.960
Yeah.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.040
When you say AI voice, though, it's like it's like speak and spell lady.

22:37.040 --> 22:40.480
Like it doesn't sound like it sounds fake.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.480
It's that whole type of thing.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.480
It adds to the humor.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.480
Yeah.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.480
Yeah.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.480
So awesome.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
That's it.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.480
Good.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.480
All right.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.480
My gaming week.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.720
I played Final Fantasy 16, which I've talked about for weeks and weeks on the program,

22:53.720 --> 22:55.640
but I finally beat the game.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.620
So obviously, I'm not going to spoil too much.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.240
But was I satisfied with the ending?

22:59.240 --> 23:00.240
Yeah, pretty much.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.800
It was it was it was a fine ending.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.680
And you know, obviously, I don't want to spoil too much.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.320
Overall, my impressions of the game are favorable.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.240
Is it the best Final Fantasy game ever?

23:11.240 --> 23:12.240
No.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.240
Is it in the top half?

23:13.240 --> 23:14.640
Yeah, I'd say it's in the top half.

23:14.640 --> 23:19.400
It's it's, you know, it's there's a lot of really good things about it, the combat system,

23:19.400 --> 23:21.120
even though yes, they went action based.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.320
It's really freakin satisfying.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.600
And there's a lot I really enjoy about it.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.600
The story, of course, is very well done.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.160
You know, I think the comparisons to like, it's a television show, where the pilot episode

23:32.160 --> 23:36.600
was that demo they put out, which was a strong like must must see TV.

23:36.600 --> 23:40.300
And then you know, the rest of the series was definitely a good series worth your time

23:40.300 --> 23:41.320
to watch.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.920
Were there a few filler episodes?

23:42.920 --> 23:45.880
Yeah, yeah, there were some filler episodes.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.800
There were some moments towards the end that were getting a little dull.

23:48.800 --> 23:53.120
There were some choices they made with the story I did not care for.

23:53.120 --> 23:57.800
Again, I'm going to bite my tongue because I don't want to inadvertently spoil something

23:57.800 --> 24:01.880
that's all I can really say the the one thing I will say because you know, of course, a

24:01.880 --> 24:07.200
Final Fantasy game will have a bad person so I can say that I will say the the overall

24:07.200 --> 24:15.520
big bad in the game week did not enjoy the character is just very super tropey to me.

24:15.520 --> 24:20.620
In fact, that was honestly the weakest part of the plot was the the villain.

24:20.620 --> 24:24.980
But there's other things that kind of help compensate for that, which is why I'm not

24:24.980 --> 24:26.480
like bad on it.

24:26.480 --> 24:30.140
But I again, I would I would be spoiling to get into further detail.

24:30.140 --> 24:33.000
And that's all I can really say.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.600
In six months, all bets are off.

24:35.600 --> 24:40.680
But until then, Quest Buster says Final Fantasy 16 was really enjoyable for me really enjoyed

24:40.680 --> 24:41.900
the story and the characters.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.600
It definitely had a few rough edges, but overall good stuff.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.080
Yeah, like that, that pretty much sums it up.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.880
There are some parts that don't add up very well.

24:50.880 --> 24:55.320
Like the crafting and the shopping system feels very like it's only here because it

24:55.320 --> 24:56.320
has to be.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.720
But like the hunts ended up playing out very well.

24:59.720 --> 25:05.280
Some of the side quests just as good as the main quest, the characters for the most part

25:05.280 --> 25:09.600
with the exception of the villain and maybe one other of the dominant characters.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.160
I thought they were all who is I'll just say kind of also an antagonist.

25:13.160 --> 25:17.240
So those that play the game know who I'm talking about, I would say all of the dominance were

25:17.240 --> 25:18.240
really good.

25:18.240 --> 25:22.120
Even, you know, there were actually a few of them that were antagonists, there's only

25:22.120 --> 25:28.640
one in particular towards the end that I didn't care for, but the others were all really good.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.400
So yeah, it's a lot of good stuff.

25:31.400 --> 25:38.920
I also appreciate that when they said we made a game without needing DLC to enjoy the complete

25:38.920 --> 25:40.560
story, they meant it.

25:40.560 --> 25:44.360
This game has a definitive start and a definitive end.

25:44.360 --> 25:48.280
I can see where they could put DLC in it if they want to.

25:48.280 --> 25:54.280
And I could see one potential thing that DLC could be about for sure, because if you look

25:54.280 --> 26:02.280
at the various icons or dominance that you come across in the game, there is one very

26:02.280 --> 26:08.320
obvious element that is missing is referred to in a throwaway line, I think just to cover

26:08.320 --> 26:14.840
that base, but they could explore more about like what happened to this, what, especially

26:14.840 --> 26:19.040
when there was a whole I feel like something got cut, because there was a whole I'll just

26:19.040 --> 26:22.940
I'll just say this isn't a spoiler because they've shown all the icons in the previous.

26:22.940 --> 26:26.960
It's Leviathan is missed the water icon Leviathan is missing.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.720
And they refer to Leviathan as like the old Leviathan.

26:30.720 --> 26:35.600
But there's a whole sequence towards the end that very much involves water and like ocean

26:35.600 --> 26:40.460
traversing and things happening in the ocean where I'm like, I feel like there could have

26:40.460 --> 26:43.800
been a Leviathan plot here that's just not there.

26:43.800 --> 26:49.600
So I I'd be curious for them to explore that a DLC will be very, very curious to see.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.440
So um, but that's my thoughts on Final Fantasy 16.

26:53.440 --> 26:57.440
Otherwise I have been playing other games as well back on Diablo four in preparation

26:57.440 --> 26:59.840
of season one starting next week.

26:59.840 --> 27:06.040
So if you are a Diablo four person, and you plan on playing the season, really good tip,

27:06.040 --> 27:11.960
go get all the Lilith statues uncovered and go uncover the entire map because those things

27:11.960 --> 27:14.360
will roll over into your seasonal game.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.760
That is not only reknown boosts, but stat boosts for your character right out the gate

27:18.760 --> 27:24.960
and that's going to really help with getting the jump on the character.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.560
Quest Buster chat says, I also had a feeling that things might have been cut too.

27:28.560 --> 27:32.400
I don't want to spoil, but it kind of felt weird to suddenly have a huge side quest dump

27:32.400 --> 27:33.720
at that part of the story.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.840
Yeah, no, I hear what you're saying.

27:35.840 --> 27:42.400
And if they don't do DLC with 16, I hope I actually and either way, I actually really

27:42.400 --> 27:48.000
hope they do a Final Fantasy 16 to I feel like they've got such a solid foundation that

27:48.000 --> 27:54.120
if they were to build upon that, and there's one character who I would love to see them

27:54.120 --> 27:58.200
base a 16 to around and again, you're gonna have to read between the lines.

27:58.200 --> 28:05.400
This character is kind of has an it has a ambiguous like you're not sure kind of fate

28:05.400 --> 28:06.520
at the end.

28:06.520 --> 28:11.280
So I would love to see them make a 16 to based on this character, but even if it's like multiple

28:11.280 --> 28:17.680
characters, or I mean, Jill actually might make for a great story kind of very, very

28:17.680 --> 28:24.520
yrp from Final Fantasy 10 to I would love to see Jill be the star of the spin off spin

28:24.520 --> 28:25.520
off game, actually.

28:25.520 --> 28:30.180
So I actually hope that there is a 60 or I'm not saying Clive is gone, because Clive could

28:30.180 --> 28:31.840
be there too.

28:31.840 --> 28:36.920
So we could, you know, I'd love to see a variety of things were 16 to could go.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.880
So we'll see.

28:38.880 --> 28:43.680
Anyway, uh, I guess that's really it.

28:43.680 --> 28:49.320
Randomly, I played Overwatch two today, because one of my friends really wanted to play a

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
game online with me.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.120
And I was like, Okay, well, what do we both have?

28:52.120 --> 28:53.680
And we decided we both have Overwatch.

28:53.680 --> 28:58.400
And the good news, I actually won, well, we won both matches, I knew what the hell I was

28:58.400 --> 28:59.400
doing.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.020
I was and I even had to play tank one of those matches.

29:02.020 --> 29:08.240
But it turns out, I am a pretty decent, decent, chaotic Winston, meaning I love to just when

29:08.240 --> 29:12.200
everybody's fighting at the front, do the Winston thing and jump to the back and punch

29:12.200 --> 29:13.520
the healers in the face.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.460
It's very satisfying.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.900
So I remembered how to do that in Overwatch.

29:18.900 --> 29:19.900
That was my gaming week.

29:19.900 --> 29:22.680
All right, we're gonna get into some gaming news.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.760
Just a quick reminder.

29:24.760 --> 29:29.840
Will not be here in two weeks, we will be here next week for Episode 969.

29:29.840 --> 29:33.960
But we will not be here in two weeks live because I will not be here I'm going to be

29:33.960 --> 29:34.960
out of town.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.040
But for a great reason.

29:36.040 --> 29:41.840
I'm going to be in Atlanta, Georgia, or the area I should say and I'm going to be at the

29:41.840 --> 29:49.560
Southern Fried Gaming Expo, which is taking place July 28, through the 30th in the Atlanta

29:49.560 --> 29:50.960
area.

29:50.960 --> 29:56.660
You can get more information, I believe the websites game atl.com is the website for that.

29:56.660 --> 29:58.580
And I'm very, very excited about this.

29:58.580 --> 30:03.920
I'm actually going to be hosting or moderating a panel there and it's a really good one.

30:03.920 --> 30:07.300
It's with some of their big guests that they actually have and you can actually see this

30:07.300 --> 30:13.780
in the app, which is available now through a site called yap is where you go to get the

30:13.780 --> 30:14.780
app.

30:14.780 --> 30:19.080
This is a panel I'm going to be on called Nintendo voices live.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.580
It's going to be Sunday one o'clock.

30:21.580 --> 30:29.160
And on this panel, there's me next to some awesome voice actors that play Nintendo characters.

30:29.160 --> 30:33.460
So it's Samantha Kelly, who's the voice of Princess Peach and Toad, Kenny James, the

30:33.460 --> 30:38.780
voice of Bowser and Laura Faye Smith, the voice of Princess Rosalina are going to be

30:38.780 --> 30:40.080
on that panel.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.540
So I'm really excited about that.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.540
That's gonna be a really cool panel.

30:42.540 --> 30:47.640
And I'm really thankful to the folks at Southern Fried for giving me that opportunity to moderate

30:47.640 --> 30:48.640
that discussion.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.180
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.780
So looking forward to it.

30:51.780 --> 30:58.060
So we'll see you there in the Atlanta area next or weekend after next July 28, through

30:58.060 --> 30:59.060
the 30th.

30:59.060 --> 31:02.480
I don't know if that panel Bobby was saying something about the panel being recorded and

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
put online.

31:03.480 --> 31:07.080
Maybe I don't know how Southern Fried does their panels after the fact, if they put them

31:07.080 --> 31:13.760
up on YouTube or what, as far as I'm concerned, if, if they don't put anything up at all,

31:13.760 --> 31:16.440
because they want people to be there live at the show, then I completely understand

31:16.440 --> 31:17.440
that.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.440
But I'll let you know if they end up putting it online.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
Okay.

31:19.440 --> 31:22.520
Bobby says they do record some and put them on YouTube.

31:22.520 --> 31:26.120
Also, Bobby here from the voice geeks network, of course, he's going to be there as well.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.700
And it's going to be in his backyard.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.280
And you know, Bobby loves the speed running community.

31:30.280 --> 31:35.360
And he's going to be there with an eternal enigma, who's also a part of the games done

31:35.360 --> 31:39.440
quick has done a lot of the announcing over the years, and also to speed running on their

31:39.440 --> 31:44.780
own and is going to be doing I think it's Silent Hill homecoming is the game that they're

31:44.780 --> 31:49.180
going to speed run live at the convention and talk about, it's going to be a little

31:49.180 --> 31:51.840
more than what you might see during games done quick, because again, they're wanting

31:51.840 --> 31:54.240
to kind of talk about speed running.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.200
And like what all goes into that, because remember, the audience isn't speed run enthusiasts,

31:58.200 --> 32:02.240
it's gaming enthusiasts who want to maybe find out more about speed running.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.240
So it's pretty cool.

32:03.240 --> 32:08.920
You can actually see I think last year's panel that was Silent Hill for question mark is

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
up online.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.240
So stay tuned for that.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.860
All coming up with the Southern Friday.

32:13.860 --> 32:14.860
Thank you.

32:14.860 --> 32:18.520
Bobby says it is on the vog YouTube channel, which I rarely promote, because we unfortunately

32:18.520 --> 32:19.800
so rarely have content up there.

32:19.800 --> 32:23.800
But that is a great piece of content to take a look at over on our YouTube channel at vog

32:23.800 --> 32:25.360
network.

32:25.360 --> 32:29.000
Okay, let's get into some gaming news from the week.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.840
And this has been getting a lot of chatter around this first story tonight.

32:33.840 --> 32:34.840
Loki.

32:34.840 --> 32:40.320
Yeah, so the Genshin Impact voice actors say they're not getting paid and they want to

32:40.320 --> 32:41.320
unionize.

32:41.320 --> 32:47.380
I mean, I would do if I wasn't getting paid as well.

32:47.380 --> 32:55.140
One of basically, we had a couple different people on it says on July 12, like Corina

32:55.140 --> 33:01.240
boater, or boater and Brandon wickler, two boys actors who have voice characters in Genshin

33:01.240 --> 33:04.980
Impact, we did about how frustrated they were in cleaning that money was owed to them and

33:04.980 --> 33:09.380
hadn't been paid in months.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.380
Basically said after the fifth email, no response.

33:11.380 --> 33:16.400
This is regarding Genshin Impact excusable for us actors to be waiting for plus months

33:16.400 --> 33:20.800
for pay when you have 80 when you make 86 million per month.

33:20.800 --> 33:27.280
Unfortunately, this is not a common problem, or not an uncommon problem.

33:27.280 --> 33:31.400
So yeah, it's kind of irritating that I mean, I guess it makes sense.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.960
All industries seem to be doing this.

33:32.960 --> 33:40.460
I mean, we have the whole actors and writers strike right now in, you know, in Hollywood.

33:40.460 --> 33:46.780
So of course, this kind of treatment extends outside of that industry as well into gaming

33:46.780 --> 33:47.780
and whatnot.

33:47.780 --> 33:50.780
But yeah, everybody should be paid on time and fairly.

33:50.780 --> 33:54.940
Yeah, so it doesn't make sense that they're just going to just Oh, we'll pay you later

33:54.940 --> 33:57.380
because these people will count on this kind of stuff.

33:57.380 --> 34:03.180
But they're trying to are they trying to put all the blame on a third party with this too?

34:03.180 --> 34:07.820
Like they're trying to say it's the organization or I don't know, it's kind of messy.

34:08.820 --> 34:18.820
Yeah, so let's see, basically, um, I don't see any details regarding a third party in

34:18.820 --> 34:19.820
here.

34:19.820 --> 34:23.300
But basically, they said that, you know, this project made billions.

34:23.300 --> 34:26.020
This project should be a union.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.780
And this wouldn't happen if the game was a union.

34:28.780 --> 34:31.780
Tell them to make the game sag.

34:31.780 --> 34:37.780
Yeah, I don't think you I don't know if I mean, I guess.

34:37.860 --> 34:43.020
Voice actors would be part of the sag they could be well they okay, so they could be

34:43.020 --> 34:46.900
right like, you know, especially your large ones like Jennifer Hale, I'm almost certain

34:46.900 --> 34:53.220
are part of sag because you might remember, a few years ago, we had a sag strike in the

34:53.220 --> 34:58.540
voice actor gaming space, you know, it's been a little bit but they actually did.

34:58.540 --> 35:03.000
So this current strike going on actually doesn't impact video games.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.580
And if you actually go on to the strike website, where it talks a little more about what they

35:06.580 --> 35:09.380
can and they can't do.

35:09.380 --> 35:12.620
Sag after folk are allowed to voice video games right now.

35:12.620 --> 35:17.660
That is not something so you know, a lot of people could be kind of talking things.

35:17.660 --> 35:21.420
But if you actually go to the strike website, it'll actually say in one of the infographics,

35:21.420 --> 35:27.260
they are allowed to work on video game voiceovers because that is that is a separate contract.

35:27.260 --> 35:31.820
Just like broadcast TV stuff is a separate contract.

35:31.820 --> 35:38.380
So long story short, Julie Chen hosting Big Brother, she can do that because technically

35:38.380 --> 35:43.300
that is it's weird, but it's under broadcast news, basically, so it's a part of that contract.

35:43.300 --> 35:47.660
Okay, so I do see the part of regarding the third party of the trans claims.

35:47.660 --> 35:53.220
So a representative from Ohio verse made a statement saying that we truly regret to learn

35:53.220 --> 35:58.820
about the ongoing situation Genshin impact values and respects the work of everyone involved.

35:58.820 --> 36:03.020
And we support our voice actors claim to their proper do we have made payments to our

36:03.020 --> 36:07.620
recording studio on time, and we have immediately urged the studio to pay our voice actors.

36:07.620 --> 36:11.500
So they're basically putting the blame on a recording studio.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.140
Okay, sure, whatever.

36:14.140 --> 36:20.180
I mean, I guess we'll have to see because ultimately, like, you know, yeah, you could

36:20.180 --> 36:24.340
make that argument that, you know, Oh, well, we paid this vendor, they didn't pay them.

36:24.340 --> 36:31.420
So but like, ultimately, you're responsible for that, you know, because you hired them.

36:31.420 --> 36:37.820
And Jason is in our chat and points out the strike is against the AMTP AMPTP contract

36:37.820 --> 36:41.180
specifically, which I think is Academy of motion, man, like all the ocean, we heard

36:41.180 --> 36:44.780
all this stuff that they talked about, like with that, like, Oh, hey, we're gonna, oh,

36:44.780 --> 36:48.380
the AI is Oh, yeah, it's awful.

36:48.580 --> 36:55.780
How ironic, you know, with Netflix in the whole brand new season of Black Mirror, it's

36:55.780 --> 37:00.540
like, it's like, this is literally what we're talking about this scenario that you put on

37:00.540 --> 37:03.940
your platform, you just like, you don't see the correlation here.

37:03.940 --> 37:08.420
It's like, we've literally talked about this, yeah, on your own platform.

37:08.420 --> 37:14.020
And in here, you're doing the thing that the long and short of it is that the emotion picture

37:14.020 --> 37:19.860
companies want to be able to have AI generated background actors, which to some extent, we've

37:19.860 --> 37:25.540
seen computer generated background things before, but they want to be able to scan people

37:25.540 --> 37:30.020
when they come in for a day and then use them as their likeness in the background and not

37:30.020 --> 37:31.460
pay them for it.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.460
It's bull.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.460
That's, yeah,

37:33.460 --> 37:34.460
that.

37:34.460 --> 37:39.940
No, they, they should inherently understand what's wrong about this request.

37:39.940 --> 37:40.940
Yeah.

37:40.940 --> 37:42.340
I mean, I can't.

37:42.660 --> 37:47.540
Sjo 100 Matt in chat says if you haven't heard it yet, listen to Fran Drescher's speech.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.580
Yes, she did do a very good job.

37:49.580 --> 37:50.580
I do.

37:50.580 --> 37:54.420
I do want to remind folks, she had some not so great perspectives during the COVID-19

37:54.420 --> 37:55.420
stuff.

37:55.420 --> 38:01.380
But I'm going to just acknowledge this particular case, she did a very good job.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.860
And that speech was very well done.

38:03.860 --> 38:07.260
And you know, you would expect coming from an actress that it was going to be well done.

38:07.260 --> 38:08.260
But she did.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.020
She did deliver for her union on that part.

38:10.020 --> 38:13.060
Yes, she did a very good job with that.

38:13.060 --> 38:15.220
So yeah, it's, it's very good.

38:15.220 --> 38:19.780
And yeah, if you look at the again, the millions and millions the executives make these same

38:19.780 --> 38:24.380
executives who are fucking yanking projects, you know what the you know what the fucking

38:24.380 --> 38:30.420
irony is of this whole thing, the irony of this strike and all that.

38:30.420 --> 38:33.940
I bet we get a Batgirl release now.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.400
That girl's probably gonna get released now.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.980
You know why?

38:36.980 --> 38:39.780
Because all this shit that they archived and threw in the vault is going to be all that

38:39.780 --> 38:40.860
they have left to release.

38:40.860 --> 38:46.660
I don't think they can because they already took the tax payment from that they got the

38:46.660 --> 38:48.380
their return on that already.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.340
Wasn't the right off this year, though.

38:50.340 --> 38:51.340
Oh, fiscal year.

38:51.340 --> 38:53.900
Yeah, so they can't do that.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.780
I mean, they can try doing that.

38:55.780 --> 39:00.700
But then they're going to be in legal trouble with, you know, well, the taxes, but like,

39:00.700 --> 39:01.700
I don't know.

39:01.700 --> 39:05.640
So the last time there was a writer's strike, they did, they started pulling in shows from

39:05.640 --> 39:08.060
Canada was one thing that they started doing.

39:08.060 --> 39:14.080
And then now that you know, you have all right, a lot of international stuff, time to shine,

39:14.080 --> 39:17.660
you can't do it on television coming back, right?

39:17.660 --> 39:18.660
They've tried.

39:18.660 --> 39:24.020
Honestly, they have tried and it failed, but I know I don't want anything to succeed in

39:24.020 --> 39:31.100
light of the strike, even that I want the actors and the union to and the writers to

39:31.100 --> 39:32.100
get a fair deal.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.260
That's what I want.

39:33.260 --> 39:36.940
So even if it costs so you can't do that on television reunion or whatever you want to

39:36.940 --> 39:41.860
put on, but South Korean TV shows will be another big one that will probably come from

39:41.860 --> 39:42.860
this.

39:42.860 --> 39:43.860
So game shows.

39:43.860 --> 39:44.860
Oh, yeah.

39:44.860 --> 39:45.860
Game shows.

39:45.860 --> 39:46.860
SS Joe 100.

39:46.860 --> 39:53.020
Matt points out reality shows using YouTubers and streamers.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.060
Mr. Beast getting a game show.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.620
Yeah, you better kind of his whole panel is already a game show.

39:58.620 --> 40:01.660
You better hope they resolve this strike quick.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.220
You better hope.

40:04.220 --> 40:08.980
So anyway, back to the issue at hand, though, against an impact.

40:08.980 --> 40:14.900
I mean, obviously, this is probably going to put more pressure for more video game productions

40:14.900 --> 40:16.980
in general to be union based.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.540
So it could be very interesting.

40:18.540 --> 40:23.180
By the way, sorry, but do you know what the interesting gray area with this whole thing

40:23.180 --> 40:24.180
right now is?

40:24.180 --> 40:28.660
And I'm very curious about this considering I host panels at conventions, and I don't

40:28.660 --> 40:32.700
know what's going to happen if Dragon Con comes up, because you know, as part of this,

40:32.700 --> 40:39.380
they cannot promote their projects, future or past.

40:39.380 --> 40:45.300
As part of this, they are allowed to do convention appearances, they're allowed to do photos

40:45.300 --> 40:48.300
and autographs and that whole thing because it's, you know, obviously, they know this

40:48.300 --> 40:51.900
is how like Star Trek actors like make their living these days, right?

40:51.900 --> 40:55.040
Is these convention appearances and many folks that do that circuit as well.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.180
So they don't want to cut it a livelihood that however, as part of it, they are not

40:58.180 --> 41:02.880
allowed to promote past or present or future stuff.

41:02.880 --> 41:06.980
So there is a huge Star Trek convention coming up, where there's going to be all these actors

41:06.980 --> 41:09.660
there, they're not going to be able to talk about Star Trek.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.620
So now what happens?

41:11.620 --> 41:16.280
You're going to get all these very interesting panels that are like, talking to Star Trek

41:16.280 --> 41:18.780
actors about philosophy.

41:18.780 --> 41:22.020
And like, actually, but it actually could be really cool, because you're going to start

41:22.020 --> 41:27.020
to see like, for example, Armin, dammit, I can't remember his name.

41:27.020 --> 41:28.020
He played Cork.

41:28.020 --> 41:29.020
Shimmerman, isn't it?

41:29.020 --> 41:30.020
No.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.020
Is it?

41:31.020 --> 41:32.020
No.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.020
Shimmerman.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.020
Yes.

41:34.020 --> 41:35.020
Yes.

41:35.020 --> 41:36.020
Yes.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.020
Yes.

41:37.020 --> 41:38.020
Okay.

41:38.020 --> 41:39.020
He is like a completely trained Shakespeare actor.

41:39.020 --> 41:43.580
I remember this because on the on the cruise that we went on, he did a whole Shakespeare

41:43.580 --> 41:46.100
class.

41:46.100 --> 41:49.700
That's going to be the type of panels you're going to see at conventions.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.380
Cork teaches Shakespeare.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.740
No, they can't even say it's Cork.

41:53.740 --> 41:57.140
They're just gonna have to say it's Armin Shimmerman doing Shakespeare because they

41:57.140 --> 42:00.540
can't talk about projects past and present.

42:00.540 --> 42:01.860
That's actually his name.

42:01.860 --> 42:02.860
So yeah.

42:02.860 --> 42:03.860
Hey.

42:03.860 --> 42:04.860
Yeah.

42:04.860 --> 42:05.860
No, no, it is.

42:05.860 --> 42:06.860
It is.

42:06.860 --> 42:07.860
But it's it's just gonna be very, very interesting.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.100
And a lot of folks in chat are talking about San Diego Comic Con.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.100
Can't do anything with that.

42:11.100 --> 42:17.460
I believe Anson Mount, who wrote and pod culture, they can't talk about Buffy either.

42:17.460 --> 42:18.460
I don't think that's what you meant.

42:18.460 --> 42:23.500
But yeah, they wouldn't be able to talk about anything past or present.

42:23.500 --> 42:27.180
Anson Mount, who of course, is on Strange New Worlds, who's going to be at the Star

42:27.180 --> 42:28.180
Trek.

42:28.180 --> 42:31.540
Well, they don't call it Star Trek because they don't have the naming rights.

42:31.540 --> 42:34.540
I think they call it the 51 year voyage or something.

42:34.540 --> 42:36.080
They call it something weird.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.380
So he's supposed to be there.

42:38.380 --> 42:42.660
He said that they are trying to work out like an interim agreement because essentially,

42:42.660 --> 42:47.860
it's an independent con producer, so that they could essentially and they're not a part

42:47.860 --> 42:53.120
of AMTPA, AMPTP.

42:53.120 --> 42:58.740
So they're going to try to do an ad hoc agreement, essentially, to do that.

42:58.740 --> 43:01.660
So I'll be very curious to see what happens with Dragon Con.

43:01.660 --> 43:05.580
I hope the strike is resolved by Dragon Con, quite frankly, I would hate to see it because

43:05.580 --> 43:06.740
that's like six weeks out.

43:06.740 --> 43:12.020
I'd hate to see it go on that long, but we're gonna have some interesting fucking panels

43:12.020 --> 43:14.140
if this doesn't get resolved.

43:14.340 --> 43:22.620
As a panel host, I'm kind of scared like what am I going to have to do?

43:22.620 --> 43:26.100
I think I'm okay because I do video gaming and again, video gaming is actually excluded

43:26.100 --> 43:27.100
from this whole thing.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.660
So we can still talk about video games.

43:28.660 --> 43:30.860
So for the most part, I feel okay.

43:30.860 --> 43:35.080
But I'm worried about other panel hosts and just that whole weird position that's going

43:35.080 --> 43:40.260
to put everybody in where we can because then the other problem is you can't really do audience

43:40.260 --> 43:41.260
questions.

43:41.260 --> 43:45.780
I mean, you can try, but you can't really do audience questions because every time they

43:45.780 --> 43:49.340
ask a question about a project, it's going to be, nope, can't do it.

43:49.340 --> 43:50.340
Nope.

43:50.340 --> 43:51.340
Can't do it.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.340
Can't talk about that.

43:52.340 --> 43:53.540
Can't talk about that.

43:53.540 --> 43:56.740
So it's going to be interesting.

43:56.740 --> 43:58.060
All right.

43:58.060 --> 44:03.740
Let's move on and talk about another story, which is, again, is also make me Oh, yeah,

44:03.740 --> 44:04.740
please.

44:04.740 --> 44:10.780
Just one other thing about this, though, is that putting our voice actors and other actors

44:10.780 --> 44:16.340
and positions that they can't speak about certain things, you know, their fans are going

44:16.340 --> 44:18.180
to get pissed, right?

44:18.180 --> 44:21.940
And hopefully direct that ire to the right source.

44:21.940 --> 44:22.940
Right?

44:22.940 --> 44:23.940
No, that's the point.

44:23.940 --> 44:24.940
And that's essentially the point, right?

44:24.940 --> 44:25.940
Yeah.

44:25.940 --> 44:26.940
Yeah.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.940
I just wanted to point that out just because it's something that people don't always think

44:29.940 --> 44:30.940
about.

44:30.940 --> 44:31.940
Yeah.

44:31.940 --> 44:34.800
If we do end up doing these panels and there is a strike going on, it will probably every

44:34.800 --> 44:40.360
strike will probably or every panel will probably open with due to the ongoing strike.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.280
We are not allowed to talk about these projects today.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.840
We would we would love to do this.

44:44.840 --> 44:49.020
But until actors can be given a fair deal, we're not allowed to talk about this to bring

44:49.020 --> 44:50.020
attention to this matter.

44:50.020 --> 44:53.240
For more information, go to sag strike or whatever the website is.

44:53.240 --> 44:57.400
Sorry, I don't know what I've taught my head by things like sag strike.org or something.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.840
You know, go go there and learn more information.

44:58.840 --> 45:04.300
Yeah, it's gonna be to try to get more awareness for social pressure to go on these companies.

45:04.300 --> 45:07.560
Although I feel I feel like they're already winning that battle.

45:07.560 --> 45:11.520
But there's a lot of people out there who are not in the know, I suppose, that aren't,

45:11.520 --> 45:15.280
you know, on social media and things like that who are not in the know still, so we'll

45:15.280 --> 45:16.280
see.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.680
All right.

45:18.680 --> 45:23.120
Let's talk about this story, which has to do with classic video games and the fact that

45:23.120 --> 45:27.600
classic video games are kind of disappearing a little bit.

45:27.600 --> 45:35.480
A recent study has come out that shows that 87% of classic video games are actually endangered.

45:36.440 --> 45:41.280
This is a study that was done by the Video Game History Foundation.

45:41.280 --> 45:45.440
They're out of production, they're unavailable in the current market, and so they're considered

45:45.440 --> 45:47.240
critically endangered.

45:47.240 --> 45:53.340
In this study, they do not consider emulation as something that's available in the current

45:53.340 --> 46:00.420
market because the average person, quote unquote, does not have the technical prowess, we'll

46:00.420 --> 46:04.680
say, I'm summarizing here, to go in and emulate games on their own.

46:04.680 --> 46:09.100
And to be fair, you know, when we talk about emulation, no one's getting a cut of that.

46:09.100 --> 46:14.220
We all know that that's why emulation is really a gray area, but we would want companies to

46:14.220 --> 46:17.680
put their stuff out a little more openly.

46:17.680 --> 46:23.720
So yeah, that's only 13% of gaming's overall history is actually readily available, so

46:23.720 --> 46:27.000
to speak.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.240
There's certain games you just can't play anymore unless you pirate them.

46:31.240 --> 46:32.240
It's the way it is.

46:32.800 --> 46:36.660
Especially a lot of like PC based games or, you know, games that got pulled off the market

46:36.660 --> 46:40.540
a long time ago, something like Rule of Rose, if you will, because of its controversial

46:40.540 --> 46:42.380
subject matter and so forth.

46:42.380 --> 46:49.460
So now, obviously, collections come out sometimes like, you know, Konami has been doing a lot

46:49.460 --> 46:53.300
of these lately with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collection, there was a Contra collection.

46:53.300 --> 46:57.660
Hamsters Arcade Archives is pretty cool and has saved a lot of games, but we all know

46:57.660 --> 47:02.100
that that's where the 13% comes from, but it's definitely not a lot.

47:02.100 --> 47:06.380
Producers don't have a solution, nor do they often care about preservation.

47:06.380 --> 47:11.480
So I think it's also coming to a call of like, we need an official way to preserve.

47:11.480 --> 47:15.340
If we want to consider video games art, we need an official way to be able to preserve

47:15.340 --> 47:16.340
this art.

47:16.340 --> 47:21.520
And the Internet Archive lost a court case not that long ago about the sharing of ebooks.

47:21.520 --> 47:29.400
So it makes the concern that we're not going to have a way to actually preserve these games.

47:29.400 --> 47:33.020
If you want to learn more about it, you can actually visit the Video Game History Foundation

47:33.020 --> 47:38.820
website, gamehistory.org, and they have a whole website set up about this, slash 87%.

47:38.820 --> 47:46.020
Again, that's gamehistory.org, slash 87%, kind of all one word, 87%, all smushed together

47:46.020 --> 47:47.020
there.

47:47.020 --> 47:49.960
If you want to read more about this, and you can see more of the reports and you know how

47:49.960 --> 47:53.580
things are not as available as they used to be.

47:53.580 --> 47:57.840
This all being said, this is very interesting because you're going to see in our, as I was

47:57.840 --> 48:04.360
putting together the outline for tonight's show, over half of our stories tonight involve

48:04.360 --> 48:08.880
older projects returning, which is great news, I think.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.300
But again, it's part of the 13%.

48:11.300 --> 48:14.740
It's not part of the 87% in this.

48:14.740 --> 48:19.160
There's a lot of games out there where the legal rights to who could even republish this

48:19.160 --> 48:23.180
game if they wanted to have been in question for a while.

48:23.180 --> 48:27.220
Dark Sakura, myself, and sometimes Loki, we talk until we're blue in the face about a

48:27.220 --> 48:31.320
game called the Guardian Legend and how awesome it would be to see that released as some type

48:31.320 --> 48:32.840
of official capacity.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.880
But the rights are in a weird place right now.

48:34.880 --> 48:39.160
I think we figured out who it is, but it's still like, it feels like a company that isn't

48:39.160 --> 48:42.720
really in a hurry to put out retro catalog stuff.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.360
We need a way to be able to preserve art like the Guardian Legend.

48:46.360 --> 48:50.480
It's a damn shame that our kids can't really officially play that game unless we download

48:50.480 --> 48:52.440
an emulator and do that whole thing.

48:52.440 --> 48:58.860
So anyway, it's definitely something to read up more about and, you know, kind of get again,

48:58.860 --> 49:03.820
sometimes it's about putting that voice and awareness out there so that we in turn put heat on

49:03.820 --> 49:09.420
our elected officials to, you know, try to allow things like the Internet Archive to remain in

49:09.420 --> 49:14.700
place or a library of gaming, if you will, which is kind of what the Video Game History

49:14.700 --> 49:16.660
Foundation basically strives to be.

49:16.660 --> 49:20.100
So it'd be very interesting to see where this goes.

49:20.100 --> 49:24.200
So, well, speaking of history, DarkSakura.

49:24.200 --> 49:34.360
Yeah, so one of the icons of the gaming industry, one Major Nelson is stepping down from Xbox.

49:34.360 --> 49:39.880
I mean, who do we think of when we think of Xbox?

49:39.880 --> 49:47.760
I mean, it's the man, you know, always been MasterChef.

49:47.760 --> 49:51.140
But yeah, MasterChef.

49:51.140 --> 50:00.100
But then again, I mean, he's been there for 20 years, and I think if he wants to step down, he should.

50:00.100 --> 50:04.740
He said primarily he wants to spend more time with his family, and that's cool.

50:04.740 --> 50:09.820
His statement is, after 20 incredible years, I have decided to take a step back and work on the

50:09.820 --> 50:12.020
next chapter of my career.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.740
Midna!

50:13.740 --> 50:14.820
Sorry.

50:14.880 --> 50:20.160
As I take a moment and think about all we have done together, I want to thank the millions of gamers

50:20.160 --> 50:23.280
around the world who have included me as part of their lives.

50:23.280 --> 50:28.560
Also, thanks to Xbox team members for trusting me to have a direct dialogue with our customers.

50:28.560 --> 50:33.760
The future is bright for Xbox, and as a gamer, I am excited to see the evolution.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.560
Thanks, and I'll see you online.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.720
Yeah.

50:36.720 --> 50:42.360
So he says he's going to take some time to spend with his family, enjoy the summer, and, you know,

50:42.360 --> 50:45.320
just take some time off before he goes on to his other projects.

50:45.320 --> 50:46.320
Yeah.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.320
Good for him.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
Yeah, he's been a great face of Xbox over the years.

50:50.320 --> 50:51.320
He really has been, you know.

50:51.320 --> 50:57.200
And, you know, in chat, Questbuster says Nintendo had Howard Phillips, and Xbox had Major Nelson.

50:57.200 --> 51:02.380
Now, Major Nelson may not have been an executive at the company like a Howard Phillips, a Reggie Fils-Aime,

51:02.380 --> 51:05.120
you know, or some of these faces we associate, you know, when we see the stage.

51:05.120 --> 51:10.180
But Major Nelson did a great job of really, you know, supporting community in many ways.

51:10.180 --> 51:16.080
And when the Xbox 360 was a big system, you know, it really started to bring us more digitally

51:16.080 --> 51:18.680
delivered content through Xbox Arcade.

51:18.680 --> 51:22.300
We also saw for a long time, a lot of his like gaming minutes and so forth were things

51:22.300 --> 51:26.180
you could download on 360 or things you could watch through the 360 store.

51:26.180 --> 51:31.780
It was really kind of before Sony and certainly Nintendo getting on that, you know, wave of

51:31.780 --> 51:38.680
delivering a message directly to the consumers through the marketplace, which is, you know,

51:38.680 --> 51:40.880
a big part of Major Nelson having handed that.

51:40.880 --> 51:45.680
And as Jonah and Matt says, for the longest time, we said blank company needs a Major Nelson.

51:45.680 --> 51:46.680
Truth.

51:46.680 --> 51:49.680
The man did a lot for Xbox and gaming in general.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.680
DJ Rama S says, I met Major Nelson when I worked at Microsoft.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.680
He was there for the Halo Midnight release.

51:54.680 --> 51:58.680
He gave my manager grief for ordering Domino's since he's from New York City.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.680
As he should, as he should.

52:02.680 --> 52:06.680
Bobby Blackwolf with an excellent point as well saying, Major Nelson was one of the very

52:06.680 --> 52:11.680
early champions of gaming podcasting and legitimized us podcasters.

52:11.680 --> 52:12.680
Truth.

52:12.680 --> 52:18.680
I don't know how often we've talked out loud about this, but Microsoft more so than any

52:18.680 --> 52:20.680
of their competitors.

52:20.680 --> 52:21.680
I'm not saying the others didn't do this.

52:21.680 --> 52:27.680
I'm just saying Microsoft more so than any of the others really embraced podcasting and

52:27.680 --> 52:34.680
indie podcasters, quite frankly, from the get go and really, you know, I invited podcasters

52:34.680 --> 52:39.680
from the early go to do some really exciting opportunity type of things.

52:39.680 --> 52:40.680
You may or may not recall.

52:40.680 --> 52:45.680
We here at Orange Orange Radio had a gamer pick of an official gamer pick on the Xbox

52:45.680 --> 52:46.680
360 marketplace.

52:46.680 --> 52:48.680
Sadly, it is no longer available.

52:48.680 --> 52:52.680
I think it's actually one of those things where like the agreement that we signed actually,

52:52.680 --> 52:54.680
I think, ended after so long.

52:54.680 --> 52:55.680
I actually think that's what it is.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.680
I think even we signed the thing that was only for like seven years.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.680
There was a way to get those back, though.

52:59.680 --> 53:01.680
They disappeared for a while then.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.680
I remember there was a way like to get it back now.

53:03.680 --> 53:05.680
Well, I never changed mine.

53:05.680 --> 53:06.680
I never changed mine.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.680
So technically, and I want to be technical.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.680
Technically, it was an all games radio.

53:10.680 --> 53:16.680
So before we were on VOG Network, we were on a network called All Games Radio and All

53:16.680 --> 53:19.680
Games Radio put out a community pack or something like that.

53:19.680 --> 53:25.680
It was a gamer pack because there was us and there was one other online radio community

53:25.680 --> 53:26.680
at the time.

53:26.680 --> 53:31.680
The name I don't recall in the moment because they've been disbanded for a while, but they

53:31.680 --> 53:35.680
had the first pack and then we had the second pack and our picture was in that.

53:35.680 --> 53:41.680
So Bobby says Gamertag Radio's community, but that was one of the shows in the other

53:41.680 --> 53:43.680
community, but I can't remember the name of that community.

53:43.680 --> 53:49.680
But it does obviously go to show how much Microsoft has really embraced.

53:49.680 --> 53:55.680
Gamertag Radio obviously has done a lot with Microsoft over the years and had, if I remember

53:55.680 --> 53:59.680
right, Phil Spencer went on their thousandth show that they did over there.

53:59.680 --> 54:04.680
So that's how much Microsoft's really embraced the whole podcasting thing and that.

54:04.680 --> 54:06.680
So it's great.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.680
And Major Nelson, of course, a huge part of that.

54:08.680 --> 54:10.680
So he will be missed.

54:10.680 --> 54:16.680
But at the same time you go 20 years, that is an awful long time to be doing one job.

54:16.680 --> 54:20.680
So you take it from us here at Orange Launch Radio, 20 years is a long time.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.680
But this isn't the job we get paid for either.

54:22.680 --> 54:26.680
So we do this because it's the quote unquote fun part.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.680
Was that Gamerscore blog?

54:28.680 --> 54:29.680
Was that it?

54:29.680 --> 54:33.680
No, Gamerscore blog was the one that put the pictures out there.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.680
I can't remember the name of the other network.

54:35.680 --> 54:36.680
I'm such a jerk.

54:36.680 --> 54:37.680
But again, it's been disbanded for years.

54:37.680 --> 54:41.680
And I think Gamertag is the only show that was on it that still exists.

54:41.680 --> 54:43.680
So, yeah.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.680
Anyway.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.680
Yeah, you have another one, right?

54:47.680 --> 54:48.680
A little tidbit.

54:48.680 --> 54:55.680
Just that I think is interesting, given that we've been bringing up classic games that

54:55.680 --> 54:59.680
are, I guess, endangered.

54:59.680 --> 55:11.680
Is that Sega is looking to, well, I mean, sort of looking to, but the president of Sega

55:11.680 --> 55:18.680
and the chief operations officer, Sugino Yukio, was talking about reboots.

55:18.680 --> 55:23.680
He, of course, did point fingers at Sonic the Hedgehog for rebooting.

55:23.680 --> 55:27.680
But they also did bring up that there are some other games.

55:27.680 --> 55:33.680
And so that the Samba de Amigo one is not a reboot, but a new game in the series.

55:33.680 --> 55:37.680
And they want to look at some other games that go back to 2D.

55:37.680 --> 55:43.680
But they're looking at their other IPs and thinking of ideas.

55:43.680 --> 55:51.680
They want to do new things, but sometimes they can breathe new life into the old ones.

55:52.680 --> 55:57.680
I mean, I would never see Sonic ever going away.

55:57.680 --> 56:01.680
But I like the whole rebooting the classic types.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.680
Because obviously we have the modern stuff.

56:03.680 --> 56:04.680
Rangers.

56:04.680 --> 56:05.680
Yeah.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.680
So, all right.

56:07.680 --> 56:11.680
And thank you, Bobby, finally scratching the itch of my memory in chat.

56:11.680 --> 56:13.680
It was called Gamercast Network was the name of that network.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.680
That's right.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.680
Now that you said it, I'm like, oh, yeah, that was it.

56:16.680 --> 56:17.680
I knew that the whole time.

56:17.680 --> 56:18.680
No, I didn't.

56:18.680 --> 56:19.680
I forgot.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.680
OK.

56:20.680 --> 56:21.680
All right.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.680
Moving on, let's go to Loki.

56:23.680 --> 56:24.680
Yeah.

56:24.680 --> 56:31.680
So, because Media Molecule is going to be taking down support for Dreams September 1st

56:31.680 --> 56:37.680
of this year, they've gone ahead and made some changes to their content policy that

56:37.680 --> 56:44.680
it's going to allow for both commercial and personal purposes use of any player created

56:44.680 --> 56:48.680
music, animations, films and art made in Dreams.

56:48.680 --> 56:54.680
So, whereas you will not necessarily be able to, I think, share stuff through Dreams, you

56:54.680 --> 57:00.680
will be able to develop stuff with Dreams to then export out to your own projects or

57:00.680 --> 57:02.680
share on the Internet in other ways.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.680
So, that's kind of neat that you can use it as a tool.

57:04.680 --> 57:09.680
I don't know how easy, aside from like doing like screen captures for like animations and

57:09.680 --> 57:16.680
stuff, you would be able to, you can't really export models or anything like that.

57:17.680 --> 57:19.680
Neat.

57:19.680 --> 57:26.680
I think the idea is fascinating in a way to, I realize this isn't exactly what they're

57:26.680 --> 57:27.680
doing, but hear me out.

57:27.680 --> 57:32.680
I think in a way it's a fascinating idea to take what they did with Dreams and really

57:32.680 --> 57:38.680
encourage people to think of it as a game making platform similar to like a Unity or

57:38.680 --> 57:40.680
a Unreal or something like that.

57:41.680 --> 57:47.680
Or click fusion or one of those like box studio making things to help you in RPG maker.

57:47.680 --> 57:48.680
I don't know.

57:48.680 --> 57:53.680
Or just like create just content that you can use in other things.

57:53.680 --> 57:57.680
So, like maybe artwork and stuff like that or you can make like little short films or

57:57.680 --> 58:04.680
like kind of as a media software instead of a game now or something like that, which is

58:04.680 --> 58:05.680
kind of neat.

58:05.680 --> 58:06.680
Yeah.

58:07.680 --> 58:11.680
I never did get around to playing this game, which is really a damn shame.

58:11.680 --> 58:13.680
Did you ever play this, Loki?

58:13.680 --> 58:14.680
I did not.

58:14.680 --> 58:16.680
I just watched a lot of videos of people playing stuff.

58:16.680 --> 58:17.680
In fact, I watched one.

58:17.680 --> 58:22.680
It was, remember, I think we talked about a while ago where somebody recreated the T-Rex

58:22.680 --> 58:27.680
scene from Jurassic Park in Dreams and they recreated the whole thing cinematically and

58:27.680 --> 58:28.680
it looks pretty cool.

58:28.680 --> 58:30.680
They expanded upon that now.

58:30.680 --> 58:35.680
They're making a game in Dreams where basically a T-Rex is like walking around.

58:35.680 --> 58:41.680
Kind of like how where they kind of teased and lost the world but never really fulfilled

58:41.680 --> 58:44.680
with it, you know, whereas you have dinosaurs in the mainland.

58:44.680 --> 58:49.680
I mean, I guess there's Jurassic World and stuff like that, but that's just silly and

58:49.680 --> 58:50.680
stupid.

58:50.680 --> 58:55.680
But what the original like thought was with that where it's kind of like almost like a

58:55.680 --> 58:59.680
horror game type of thing where there's a T-Rex stalking you outside of your house type

58:59.680 --> 59:02.680
of thing and you have to figure out what's going on.

59:02.680 --> 59:03.680
So, it looked kind of cool.

59:03.680 --> 59:06.680
I think Dreams and Media Molecule kind of got dealt a bad deal.

59:06.680 --> 59:07.680
I mean, even I.

59:07.680 --> 59:09.680
It was very abstract.

59:09.680 --> 59:14.680
I follow video games a lot and even I kind of like this blipped on my radar, but it never

59:14.680 --> 59:19.680
like cemented on my radar and I feel like Sony didn't push it enough compared to like

59:19.680 --> 59:20.680
Little Big Planet or something.

59:20.680 --> 59:23.680
Maybe it was because it was a harder to I don't know.

59:23.680 --> 59:26.680
I just feel like Sony didn't push it as much as they should have.

59:26.680 --> 59:30.680
But I guess it's easy to say that in retrospect about a lot of titles.

59:30.680 --> 59:31.680
So.

59:31.680 --> 59:32.680
All right.

59:32.680 --> 59:38.680
Well, moving on to this next story, you know, we've been talking about retro games that

59:38.680 --> 59:41.680
are disappearing and so forth.

59:41.680 --> 59:48.680
But man, if you want to talk about a retro game, like Criterion Collection type of way

59:48.680 --> 59:51.680
of preserving it, this looks really stunning.

59:51.680 --> 59:58.680
So, Digital Eclipse has actually announced this game that is the making of.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:03.680
I always called this game Karateka, but I think it's actually Karateka is what it's

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.680
supposed to be.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.680
But I always say karate because, you know, it's in the Karateka.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.680
But anyway, there's many ways to pronounce this.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.680
Digital Eclipse has announced the making of this.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.680
It is a gold master series.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.680
Basically, this game looks like it is made in the Atari 50 engine, which really wasn't

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.680
bad at all.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:25.680
It has a similar type of timeline and all of these clips that you can see in the trailer

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.680
that's playing live on Twitch.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:33.680
But even if you're listening on the podcast feed, you just see lots of concept art, photographs,

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.680
prototypes, different versions of the game.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.680
So, you know, because again, games that came out back then went on like 20 different platforms.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.680
So, there's actually going to be like four different versions of the game that will be

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.680
available like Commodore 64, Apple 2.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.680
There's going to be a prototype available of the game.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680
This is awesome.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.680
So, the editorial director of Digital Eclipse, Chris Koehler, said our mission with the gold

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.680
master series is to elevate these games, presenting them in the best possible light while putting

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.680
them in their proper historical context, an approach we've dubbed the interactive documentary.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.680
So, again, if you've played Atari 50, you know what this is essentially going to look

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.680
like.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.680
And there's a whole new remastered version as well that looks pretty good.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.680
Like the remasters that were in the Atari 50 collection.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.680
I didn't like the games so much that they like rebooted.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.680
Like they did like a haunted house thing that was very meh to me.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:34.680
But in that collection, they put like a Yars revenge that was just basically the Atari

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.680
2600 version of Yars revenge.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.680
But like with modern, like not even modern graphics, like it just like put a modern effect

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.680
kind of on the graphics that made it look very new and stuff.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.680
And that's what you kind of saw going on with Karateka.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.680
And that I think it looks really cool.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.680
I think for me, this is all about price because I don't think you could charge 70 bucks for

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.680
this.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.680
In fact, it might be hard to charge a lot.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.680
But man, if they release this at the right price, I hope people buy it and eat this up

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:07.680
because this is the way to I mean, this is preservation in every sense of the word.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:13.680
By the way, if you don't know Karateka, it was an older PC game and it kind of the same

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.680
creator ended up making Prince of Persia.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.680
So that whole movement and what went into those sprites early on, like it was really

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.680
unheard of the amount of fluidity that went into the sprite and the old art direction

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.680
in those games.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.680
That's why, you know, because you may be sitting there going, I've never heard of Karateka.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.680
But it was it did new things for art and it did new things for, you know, like a game

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.680
that wasn't really a loop.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.680
It was a game that you move through like a story.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.680
It's not the first one that ever existed, but it's first one that really did it.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.680
At this type of level.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.680
It's really, really cool.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.680
Bobby points out that Karateka was the first game that had humans in cut scenes.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680
Oh, good point.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.680
Because, you know, Pac-Man had Pac people and ghosts, but not humans.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680
Well, it's very interesting.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.680
So, hmm.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.680
Dark to see you in chat says, I'm actually kind of excited.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.680
I was never super good at Karateka, but I did play it.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.680
Wouldn't be opposed to owning a definitive criterion style version of it.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.680
Questbuster in chat says the rotoscoping techniques used in this were so groundbreaking at the time.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.680
So seriously, even if you've never heard of Karateka, I feel like this is the type of game where it's like,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.680
you can learn something about the gaming industry.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.680
This is this is any YouTuber that wants to comment on the industry should be required

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.680
to play a game like this and understand what all goes into it.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.680
So and I'm happy to play it and educate myself as well.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.680
I think it's it's cool.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.680
I I hope it is successful and I hope they're encouraged to do this with more old school games for sure.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.680
Because, yeah, Atari 50 is really not a bad collection at all.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.680
It's quite good considering the Atari collections over the years.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:58.680
So Bobby Black Wolf in chat says this is kind of like watching Casablanca and then being like, wow, this shit is so derivative.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.680
And then you realize that Casablanca is what defined the tropes.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.680
Yes.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.680
Yes. Bury that. Bury that.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.680
All right. Let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:23.680
Anyway, they have Atari has gone with Dreams Incorporated to do an adaptation of Lunar Lander called Lunar Lander Beyond.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:35.680
Should be out this year for PC and console, but it's adding some simulation and narrative to the game and some precision mechanics added on in.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:49.680
You basically are the appointed the newest captain of the Pegasus Corporation and you have to guide your crew through these various areas with very demanding missions.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.680
You go in space and deliver cargo and do all kinds of stuff like that.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:05.680
And and it also looks so there's a conflicting information here said that it's supposed to be in the first half of twenty twenty four for Switch.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.680
So anyway, yeah, cool game.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.680
I'm actually I like the art direction and I think that it looks really neat.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.680
Yeah. And I remember the old school.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.680
Very vibrant.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680
Is so difficult.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680
And kind of toonie.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.680
Yeah.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:28.680
Hopefully adding the narrative element to it will breathe new life into it.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.680
All right.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.680
That's it.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.680
Loki.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.680
All right. So this is great news.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:45.680
If you are looking to play some emulators on the Xbox series S or X, you may remember they had this available before the UWP folks were either.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.680
Well, actually, even before that, they did they were loading them in through the dev mode.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.680
If you paid like 20 bucks to Microsoft, you can get your console unlocked to be a developer console.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.680
And then they would just take developer versions of those emulators and run them on there.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:16.680
That got shut down. And then, of course, there was a workaround that allowed you to do it without having your console in developer mode, basically downloading a specific UWP app through the Web browser.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:30.680
And now they're back doing the same thing again, except they're trying to hide it a little bit better with the package, disguising in a way that you won't necessarily won't be as caught as quickly by Microsoft.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:36.680
So the hacker group UWeapons has basically figured out a way to do this.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:44.680
They have a way you basically sign up to their Patreon and you're given the link to go download the app.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.680
And they have different emulators in there.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:55.680
I think it was the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Dreamcast are in there.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.680
And yeah, it looked like it was running pretty well.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:08.680
I just I don't play on my console enough to bother trying this out, but it looked cool.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.680
You can play, you know, Wii games on there, boot up some Excite truck again.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.680
But yeah, pretty cool looking thing.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.680
I wonder how quickly they will catch and patch this out.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.680
Probably not too long.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.680
Yeah, probably not too long before they do that.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:37.680
But even if they do patch it out or this is too difficult for you to follow, we now have an official way to enjoy retro games on the Xbox.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.680
And let me tell you, my jaw hit the floor when I heard this news this week.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.680
You know why?

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:48.680
Because on last week's show here on OLR, this is not this is not a Rob Stradamus thing.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.680
This is a chat Stradamus thing.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:56.680
Out of the blue, SG100 Matt, I think it was, asked us about Antstream or brought up the topic of Antstream.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:04.680
The, of course, you know, cloud based gaming system that rolled out a few years ago at this point.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:09.680
I think it was just before the pandemic had rolled out and it was on Xbox One.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.680
And I remember saying, God, I wish they would have brought that out for Series S or X.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.680
I would have loved to have played that and continue doing that on Xbox.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.680
But I ended up letting my subscription lapse, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.680
Well, somebody was fucking listening.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.680
Let me tell you, because this week the news came out.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:32.680
Antstream Arcade has announced they will be coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S later this month.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:40.680
And games that were previously only playable on Sony or Nintendo platforms will become playable on Xbox through its service.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.680
I do want to say, I think that's a cute little tagline.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:52.680
It isn't the first time that Sony and Nintendo games have been playable on maybe I don't even know.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.680
I don't know if they're talking first party because I don't think anything first party is on the service.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.680
I don't see Nintendo ever licensing that.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.680
But maybe, maybe Donkey Kong arcade or something.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:07.680
I don't know. But my point is, the Rare Replay had Cobra Triangle in it, an NES game, among other games.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.680
I'm just doing the ones I remember.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:18.680
And then of course, all these Konami collections over the years actually do have NES games and PlayStation games even in the case of Castlevania.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.680
You know, and Subcontra is in them.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.680
So it's technically not the first time they're playable.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:30.680
But okay, you know what, there are certain picks in here that are going to be playable for the first time.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.680
Sure, of course, we'll give them that.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:37.680
Anyway, retro titles that go all the way back to the Commodore era.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.680
You can play games because it's through the clouds.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.680
You don't really install anything except the player.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.680
They've been adding more and more retro titles through time.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:55.680
And of course, this is already available on PC, Mac, Linux, Android, Android TV, Fire Stick, Samsung, and the web browser.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.680
Funny enough, this press release neglected the Atari VCS. Oh, well.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.680
And stream arcade is coming out for $30 later this month, a year.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:11.680
You pay for $30 a year or if you want lifetime access, 80 bucks.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.680
So could be interesting.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.680
It's not bad. I mean, if you're really into retro games, that's not a bad price.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.680
If you're really into retro games, it's not a bad price at all, to be honest.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.680
And the collection was pretty decent.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.680
I mean, I let my service run out some time ago, and it's only gotten better since then.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.680
Like, I don't remember things like Ninja Gaiden, Mortal Kombat, Spy Hunter.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:32.680
I don't remember these games being on the service.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.680
But you know I love me some Commodore 64.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.680
And there were some really great games that were on the service from the Commodore 64 era.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.680
So I think it's worth a look, if nothing else.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.680
I think they have a monthly version too.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:52.680
But yeah, the service will be available in Europe, the UK, USA, Canada, and Vatican City.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:59.680
So sadly, I'm not seeing Mexico or Australia or some of the other places I know we have listeners at in this yet.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.680
But cross your fingers and your toes.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.680
Do you have any listeners in the Vatican?

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.680
Yeah, I don't think we have any. Just one.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.680
I don't think we have any listeners in the Vatican.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.680
It's like some assistant to some bishop who works for the Pope.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.680
Yeah, yeah, right.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.680
He loves video games.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.680
Yeah.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:24.680
But I wonder, so of course Deft is in chat saying, boo, I wonder if you can't create a US account and get the service that way.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.680
VPM.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.680
Yeah, because I'm sure you all are already familiar with that process from some other companies.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680
So anyway.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.680
And they said, well, there's a thing on here, which I don't know, we don't talk about preordering very much.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:46.680
But like they said, if you preorder it and stream arcade on Xbox, one in 10 will get upgraded to a lifetime pass edition for free.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.680
Fine.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680
All right, cool.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.680
I hope it's for free.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.680
Doesn't specify for free.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:56.680
We're just going to randomly charge some of you guys a little bit more than you wanted.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.680
I hope you don't mind.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.680
That would be funny.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:08.680
All right, well, for our next segment, I don't think this game is on Antstream, but it's still worth a trip down memory lane nonetheless.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.680
Let's roll the bumper.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:28.680
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.680
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.680
And what did you pick Dark Sakura?

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:42.680
I picked Parasite Eve, another game I thought I had done, but apparently not.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.680
Parasite Eve came out in 1988, and it's a role play game that was published by Square.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:54.680
It's actually a sequel to the novel Parasite Eve, which I've actually started reading.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:01.680
The novel is written by Sena Hideaki, and this was the first game of the video series.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:15.680
It follows a police officer named Aya Brea over a six-day span in 1997 to stop Eve, who is a woman who plans to destroy humanity through spontaneous human combustion.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.680
That's kind of cool.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.680
I mean, what a way to go, right?

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.680
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:34.680
This is Square's first M-rated game, and the first major American-Japanese game development collaboration.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:41.680
It was produced by Sakaguchi Hironobu, and directed by Tokida Takashi.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:49.680
And the music, of course notable, one of my favorite game music people of all time, Shinomura Yoko,

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:57.680
who was tasked with doing an inorganic and emotionless soundtrack, and actually had two album releases.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:04.680
It was considered overall very positive, though some people considered it to be too linear.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:21.680
At any rate, the game was actually part of a bigger thing in Japan where different horror was being sort of re-sparked in the public eye.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:33.680
And so the book actually ended up being re-released and had a film adaptation and two manga, one based on the book and the other one based on the game.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:42.680
And then there were two sequels to the game, Parasite Eve 2 in 1999 and The Third Birthday in 2010.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:49.680
Also, the game was re-released on PSN in 2010.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:57.680
And basically the first two games have shipped over three million copies by 2010 worldwide.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.680
So this was...

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:10.680
There were other games that Square was releasing at the time that had some very experimental type of combat systems.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:17.680
You know, for their mechanics like Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil, they were kind of going along with some of that.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:25.680
And this was considered to be a cinematic RPG, so it was trying to evoke like a movie experience.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:34.680
So you can only move around to specific destinations in the game on this world map, which is basically a map of Manhattan.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.680
And then you get, like on a hotspot, you get a random encounter.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:48.680
So they materialize and attack you on the screen you're running around on, so like no battle mode or special thing.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:56.680
And then in the game you have an active time bar that basically it has to go through a cycle before you can take your turn.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:03.680
But you can move around to dodge attacks during your waiting period.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:10.680
And then you can choose to attack, so the battle pauses so you can do your thing.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:15.680
Or you can not attack.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:26.680
So you also have a tune-up option that when you choose a weapon that can be altered and attribute certain things to it.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.680
And then of course you gain levels as you go through it.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.680
When you beat the game you do have a new game plus mode that's called EX Game.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.680
You have every item stored in the police station.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.680
You begin with the final weapon and armor, the stuff you chose before ending the game.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.680
But you go back to being level one.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:56.680
But the bonus points that you got at the end of the game are now available for you to use.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:01.680
Items, weapons, power-ups, enemies, everything is more powerful.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:21.680
And a big difference is that you can now go through the Chrysler building that has 77 randomized floors that leads to a final boss battle with, I would reckon, the true enemy of the game.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.680
Which is, spoilers, Aya's older sister, Maya.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:36.680
So the game starts off at Carnegie Hall and I have to say the first time I saw this I was like, the shit is happening.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:46.680
So Aya is an NYPD rookie. You go to Carnegie Hall with a blind date for Christmas Eve 1997.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:55.680
And during the opera everyone spontaneously combusts, except for Aya, her date and an actress on stage named Melissa Pierce.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:06.680
And Aya goes to confront her and Melissa talks about Aya's mitochondria because mitochondria comes up in this game because people don't know how mitochondria work in the real world.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:13.680
And then she turns into a critter, runs into the sewers, and now calls herself Eve.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.680
That's the start of the game. If you went into the rest of it, you can play it yourself.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.680
But it is based off of the novel that was released in 1995.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.680
And it is considered a sequel to the book.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:45.680
In fact, it even references events in the book that refer back to Anzai Mariko, who was the main woman in the book that Eve had chosen to become her host in the novel, being Aya's mother.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:56.680
So yeah, that's why I want to go back and read the book because I didn't at the time and I have some love of the genre.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:05.680
Aya was created by Sakaguchi Hironobu, but designed by Nomura Tetsuya. We all know Nomura.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:17.680
And she was originally designed by someone else, but the sketches didn't make Sakaguchi happy and he wanted someone with long hair that was a lot more like Aerith.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:31.680
And so Nomura had done some drawings and was working on another character sketch and got them mixed up. So it gave her, you know, shorter hair.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:40.680
The original concept was her to be strong, sexy, and be witching. And she was named for Sakaguchi's daughter, Aya.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:47.680
But at any rate, due to the mix-up though, we liked the design and that's what stuck.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.680
It was released on March 29th, 1998 in Japan for PlayStation.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:20:04.680
It had full motion video ads and the game was, the same commercials were aired in the US prior to its release.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:12.680
But there was a shipping issue with 200 copies of the game shipped to Best Buy a week before release.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:23.680
It was the first game to be rated mature by the ESRB and the first released under Square Electronic Arts as a joint venture.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.680
And it came out in North America September 9th, 1998.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:39.680
Before the third birthday came out in 2010, Kitase Yoshinori and Nomura Tetsuya were talking about a re-release of Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve 2.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.680
But it was held up due to rights because it was co-owned with Sena Hideaki, the author.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:51.680
But it did get a re-release in Japan and North America on PlayStation Network.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.680
And it was included in the Japanese lineup of PlayStation Classic.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:03.680
So like I said, music was done by Shinomura Yoko, including the main theme called Primal Eyes.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:12.680
And then there's a vocal song, Somnia Memorius, that was performed by Shani Rigsby.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:19.680
The album being a combination of opera and electronica really, really took off.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:23.680
I mean, she's an amazing composer regardless.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:33.680
And of course, she went on to do Kingdom Hearts and music on Super Mario RPG.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:36.680
But it's considered that Parasite Eve is her breakout piece.

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:47.680
And it was also the first of her projects that had vocal themes in it, had a vocal ending theme.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.680
So she designed all of that too.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.680
And the lyrics for all the vocal pieces were written by Shinomura.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.680
And there was a track called I Hear a Voice Asking Me to Awaken.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:04.680
It's actually an arrangement of a Bach piece.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.680
I'm going to mispronounce this because I'm not very good with German.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:20.680
But anyway, the soundtrack was released through DigiCube May 21st, 1998.

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.680
And it was reprinted through Square.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:32.680
And basically, I mean, there's also a Parasite Eve remix 10-track album that had...

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.680
And some of these names might actually sound familiar, Rob.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:50.680
There was remixes by Tomo Quadra, Dan Kay, Tribal Masters, Kei Nakayama, and Dummy Run.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:56.680
And yeah, major awesome soundtrack.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.680
The game was, like I said, very well received.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:07.680
Its rating with Famitsu was 33 out of 40, which is pretty good.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:11.680
Because Famitsu has a track record of being Hard as Balls.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:15.680
Sorry, I'm losing my voice.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:25.680
The game was compared to Resident Evil series, but that Parasite Eve has deeper gameplay and more hidden areas to discover.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:37.680
But the combat was compared a bit more to Final Fantasy VII, where the dynamic camera made things a little bit hard to navigate.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:45.680
However, the author of the book approved of the game and said that he was actually impressed with how well the game makers translated the novel.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:54.680
It was nominated by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences as a finalist for console game of the year.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:24:02.680
Console action game of the year, and console role-playing game of the year during the second annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:10.680
It was ranked in 2016 by Hamitsu readers as one of the top 100 PlayStation games of all time.

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.680
Pretty high up.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.680
And yeah, even to this day, it still gets positive reviews.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:28.680
So, Parasite Eve was actually an inspiration for other items that came out in the Jehora phenomenon.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:35.680
Including the books for The Ring, which is Ring, Spiral, and Loop.

01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.680
And two video game sequels and a manga adaptation.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:46.680
And it's based on the video game universe called Parasite Eve Diva.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.680
And there you go. That's the game.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.680
Parasite Eve. I'm gonna admit, this is one I kind of missed.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.680
I think I played it briefly, like a friend of mine had it.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:04.680
But I wasn't super into it for some reason.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.680
And I think this is where I was at in my life at the time.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.680
And Rob Roberts in 1998 was very different.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.680
I didn't enjoy playing it. I enjoyed watching it.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:20.680
Yeah, I think that's it. I wasn't a fan of the game mechanic side of things.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:28.680
But again, how many games have I played where maybe I felt one way about it 25 years ago.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.680
And I'll probably feel different about it now if I were to go back and play it again.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:38.680
I did finish it. I don't remember much about it though, other than it being weird.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:44.680
I wanted to play the third birthday though, because I heard that that was really awesome.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.680
ZenMonkey11 in chat says, I remember the ads for this game. The good old days. Yeah.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:54.680
Pelehanumeya says, wasn't there a Parasite Eve 2? Yeah, it's the third birthday.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.680
I mentioned it. No, no, no. The third birthday was not Parasite Evil 2.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.680
It was Parasite Evil 2 and then the third birthday.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.680
Yes, sorry, because obviously it's three.

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:09.680
Questbuster in chat says, I know it's wishful thinking, but I hope they release all three games as part of a collection.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:19.680
You never know. We did just have that story or that talk about how Square Enix was relatively pleased with the Final Fantasy pixel collection and how that went over.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.680
And that could lead to more. Now, obviously, this isn't a pixel game. So maybe it's from the wrong.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.680
But it's still I think it's showing Square Enix. There is big interest in the back catalog. Absolutely.

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:36.680
So, yeah, they'll just bring it back as an action game and then it'll be like Bayonetta.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.680
OK, but where's the problem?

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.680
It's not the same.

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.680
You said one of my favorite games. I love Bayonetta.

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:51.680
So it was just, yeah, they got to do it right, obviously, if they if they were to modernize it or what have you.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.680
All right. Great pick. Parasite Eve, classic game of the week.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:02.680
I'm myself as well surprised not in the last 700 episodes that we talked about that game.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:09.680
All right. Moving on to some rapid fire news, some other headlines from the gaming world. Loki.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.680
Yep. This is kind of interesting.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:20.680
It's a it's a little mod for Half-Life 2 that turns it into a Lego Half-Life 2 game.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.680
It's silly. Show this to Alan. He loves Half-Life.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:26.680
Yeah. Not everything is necessarily Lego in it.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:34.680
It's kind of just taking the main like main playable characters in the game and switch them out for Lego characters.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.680
But I mean, it looks pretty legit.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.680
I mean, if they just did like all the background stuff as well as Lego, that could be really cool.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.680
Maybe perhaps that could come later on. I mean, after all, it is it is a mod.

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.680
You could just redo all the assets for it.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:52.680
But yeah, it it looks looks like a Lego game.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:58.680
And if you have Half-Life, then, you know, it's pretty much for I think any actually.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.680
Yeah, I think Half-Life 2 and you can download it for free. So check it out.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:10.680
And then we had kind of a slip maybe or something that's not been officially announced yet,

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:17.680
but it's been confirmed on the I believe it was TikTok or Instagram.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:24.680
No, TikTok. They had a trailer that they did for the boys.

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.680
For their integration with Call of Duty, which apparently is all sorts of broken.

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:37.680
But with that, someone said moral combat win and then the actual account for it's Vought International,

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:46.680
which is like the fictional company that basically runs all of the seven, which is the superhero group that's evil in the boys.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.680
And they said, you know, confirmed basically, you know.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:54.680
So I guess we'll have to wait and see.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:59.680
Homelander for a playable character in Mortal Kombat would be pretty crazy.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.680
I mean, it makes a lot of sense.

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.680
It absolutely makes a lot of sense.

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.680
Consider that we've been getting a lot more licensed characters in Mortal Kombat games lately.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.680
It's yeah, makes sense.

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:11.680
I can see it in the perfect. Yeah.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.680
All right.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:18.680
All right, Dar Sakura.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.680
You're muted on Discord. I see the little mute icon.

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.680
You know, I would see that if I was actually looking at it.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:34.680
There are some updates for PlayStation Plus's game catalog for July.

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:37.680
Excuse me. We will see.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:46.680
It takes two. The Ascent, Undertale, Twisted Metal one and two.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:57.680
Circus Electric, Dynasty Warriors nine, Dismantle, Fast and Furious, Spy Racers, Rise of the Shifter, whatever.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.680
Melty Blood, Type Lumina.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:06.680
Just a bunch of others. And then, of course, a My Little Pony game, but there are still bronies in the universe.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:13.680
Sniper Elite 5, World Wars Ed. So there you go.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.680
Gravity Crash Portable is also on the list.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:22.680
We've had more and more gaming companies throughout the industry that are unionizing.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.680
And now the latest and greatest to join them is Sega of America.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:33.680
That's right. Sega of America voted ninety one twenty six in favor of their unit.

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.680
The Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega or Aegis.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:42.680
I think we've heard this on the show before, because I remember making a joke that that was an item in Ingress.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:48.680
Well, it just means shield. Yeah. Nineteen ballots were challenged, but three of them were avoided.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:54.680
But whatever. However, they got there, they are now officially organized for the Communications Workers of America.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:31:03.680
The unit is more than 200 workers in different departments throughout Sega, brand marketing, games service, marketing services, localization, sales and quality assurance product development.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:13.680
It's not the first games unit in North America, but it is the largest multi department union of organized workers in the entire gaming industry.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:20.680
But ZeniMax Workers United was around 300 quality assurance workers. But of course, that is one department.

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:27.680
Still, however you slice it, however it breaks the record books, pretty cool to see. Certainly won't be the last. That's for sure.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:35.680
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out to a store near you starting in the U.S., Loki.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.680

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:42.680
Ninja Savior's Return of the Warriors on PC.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:47.680
I completely forgot that this is coming out, but finally it can stop seeing the stupid Nintendo...

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.680
Well, I say that, but then they're going to show it for DLC and stuff.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:53.680
Pikmin 4 on Nintendo Switch this week.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:33:00.680
And then finally, Stephanie on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.680
We'll never be rid of Pikmin 4.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.680
Pikmin, aren't they good in barbecue?

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:12.680
Rob, you're muted.

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:17.680
Sorry about that. Gosh, it's a plague that's spreading, isn't it?

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:21.680
So anyway, Pikmin is also available in Japan this week.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.680
If we want to start off with that, Pikmin 4.

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.680
Some other games that are coming out on the Switch this week.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.680
We have Cross Tales coming out on the Switch.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:33.680
Zero Fire, Toaplan Arcade Garage is out this week.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:34.680
Nice.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:35.680
Toaplan Shooters.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:38.680
No, I know, but I was like, oh, it's Zero Wing and Hellfire.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.680
It's that long awaited Zero Wing re-release that's coming out.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:50.680
Nobunaga Ambition Rebirth with a power-up kit in a regular and a limited edition is out this week in Japan as well.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.680
Moto, not that, that gets into something else.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:04.680
How about an amiibo for Pyra and Mythra is coming out for Super Smash Brothers amiibo this week in Japan as well.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.680
Taking a look at the PlayStation 5 to look at releases there.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:11.680
Evil West is out as well as Cross Tales in Japan this week.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.680
Both of those on the 20th.

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.680
Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:21.680
On the 18th, we have Cuphead and Super Smash Bros.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.680
On the 18th, we have Cuphead Limited Edition for PlayStation and Switch.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.680
Also on the 18th, T'Chaya Oleiti Edition.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.680
That's on PlayStation.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.680
On the 20th, for looks like PC, we have Sims 4, a Horseranch expansion.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.680
Yay.

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.680
On the 21st, for Switch, Pikmin 4.

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.680
And that's it.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.680
All right.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:54.680
We still have some more news coming at you, including more really cool retro releases.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.680
In fact, there's quite a few of these here, right, Loki?

01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.680
Yes, there's a lot.

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:05.680
So I'm going to try to go over them pretty quick, but they had the Limited Run Games 3 2023.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.680
Their Limited Run Saves E3 Summer Games Showcase.

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.680
It's a very long title.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.680
But they were basically talking about a bunch of different titles coming out.

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:19.680
They made it look like a retro E3, which I thought was kind of funny.

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:24.680
So the games announced and I'm going to try to be really quick with this.

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.680
The Castlevania Advanced Collection.

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.680
So it's all the Game Boy Advance and I think DS games as well.

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.680
And there's like four titles in there.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.680
So that's coming out here actually at the end of the month.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.680
Rise of the Triad Ludicrous Edition is getting a physical release.

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.680
Komaju Remilia Scarlet Symphony.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.680
Tiger Heli.

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.680
And we had Kara Tekka.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.680
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles soundtracks.

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.680
The games are actually, the soundtracks are coming out in vinyl.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:36:00.680
And I think even like a cassette tape, which is kind of weird.

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.680
Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.680
El Shaddai Essentials of the Metatron was coming to the consoles.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.680
I think actually that's to the Switch.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.680
And then Dungeons of Aether.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:20.680
We have the Shantae Adverse Risky Revolution or Advanced Risky Revolution.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.680
And that's coming out of the consoles as well.

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.680
Some of the more stranger things that are coming out,

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.680
that they kind of finished up with.

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.680
The Gex Trilogy is coming to the consoles.

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.680
Some of these actually, these last four.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:40.680
So the Gex Trilogy, Tomba, the Jurassic Park Elastic Games Collection.

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.680
I'm sorry, people are really excited about Tomba.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.680
That is like out of nowhere, honestly.

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.680
That's great.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.680
Yeah, so that one and Clock Tower.

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.680
Those are all coming thanks to the Carbon Engine,

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:55.680
which Modern Vintage Gaming has actually been working to develop.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.680
So it's like some engine that's going to allow them to port games a little bit easier.

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.680
So it's kind of neat.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:06.680
The original Clock Tower has been on my list for Super Famicom.

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.680
Yeah, it's really cool.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.680
They've got a lot of things.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.680
Disney's Gargoyles Remastered.

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.680
That's out of nowhere.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.680
That's kind of strange.

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:21.680
We have Plumbers Don't Wear Ties Definitive Edition.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.680
That's pretty funny.

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.680
Midnight Fright Express.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680
Colossal Cave.

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.680
Another Crusade.

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:31.680
Rose and Camelia Collection.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.680
Double Shake.

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.680
Chicory.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.680
Odinkat's Paradise Collection.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:43.680
Arzette the Jeweled Faramore, I guess.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.680
And This Way Madness Lies.

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:53.680
So lots of obscure games and older games being brought back and remastered.

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.680
There's even, I think, Clock Tower is one.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.680
I think that they have actually new games coming from that as well

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:06.680
and being worked on by, oh, gosh, I can't remember the name now, the studio.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:12.680
It was WayForward is doing a new Clock Tower game.

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:15.680
So pretty awesome.

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.680
It's going to be scary.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:20.680
Those games are pretty intense from what I remember.

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.680
Yeah.

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.680
All right.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:26.680
Well, some folks in chat are talking about if that Castlevania collection already had a physical release.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.680
I thought it was digital only.

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.680
I didn't realize it had a physical release before.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.680
I thought they only offered that on the digital front.

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.680
I know it's been out, but I didn't know it was a physical release.

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:42.680
But again, I don't go shopping very often for games physically.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:48.680
I bought Final Fantasy XVI physical to have it, and I just walked into Best Buy.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.680
But now it's the thing where I order it online, I walk into Best Buy, hand me my product, please.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.680
They hand me my product and I leave.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.680
I don't really go shopping for what else is there.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.680
So I could have missed it.

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:00.680
All right.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:05.680
It's funny seeing Gex trilogy as the one more thing that they have.

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.680
I just I thought that was funny.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.680
It's pretty funny.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.680
All right.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.680
Well, maybe this is another game that they should re-release at some point.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.680
Dark Sakura.

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.680
Oh, good Lord.

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.680
So Daytona USA 2001.

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.680
OK, actually, not not really a bad a bad version of Daytona USA.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:31.680
In the US, it came out just as Daytona USA on Dreamcast.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:37.680
But now the online multiplayer has been reinstated because of Dreamcast Live.

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.680
You would have to go to Dreamcast Live's connection page for instructions on how to get your Dreamcast online.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.680
It makes me wonder if they have Phantasy Star working now.

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.680
That had to have been the highest priority.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:58.680
Yeah, but at any rate, the game is coded with the modem adapter.

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.680
Yeah, Phantasy Star Online is one of the supported ones, by the way.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.680
Cool.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:10.680
But you would basically need to use to run the game with Dream Pi.

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.680
You have to update your software and it will not work with the official broadband adapter.

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.680
So there you go.

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.680
So you have to how are you going to use a modem to do it?

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.680
Probably a virtual.

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:28.680
There's probably still dial up Internet services.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.680
I mean, there are not in this.

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.680
I mean, there's a few places in this country.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:33.680
But yeah.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:34.680
Yeah.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.680
I mean, if there's still a blockbuster somewhere in America, that's somebody who's using dial up.

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.680
I mean, if if NASA is still using tech from the 60s, then yes.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.680
If Comcast is still trying to sell you landline, you know.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.680
Right.

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.680
All right.

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.680
Well, I had to explain to someone what a landline is.

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.680
All right.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:58.680
Well, moving on, Loki, what else are they going to try to sell us?

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:01.680
They're going to try to sell us a handheld evercade.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.680
We'll lease a smaller handheld evercade because they already have a handheld evercade.

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:10.680
But the Super Pocket, it's a brand new edition that they're putting out.

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:15.680
They're going to have a couple of different ones available to have some packing games with them.

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.680
And you can get that in either a Capcom flavor or a Taito flavor.

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.680
So Capcom's coming with 1942, 1943, 1944.

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:36.680
Bionic Commando, Captain Commando, Final Fight, Forgotten Worlds, Ghouls and Ghosts, Mega Man, Street Fighter II, Hyper Fighting, Strider and Wolf of the Battlefield, Mercs.

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:44.680
And then the Taito edition, Bubble Bobble, Kadesh, Jack and Pop, Don, Doko Don, Elevator Action, Football Champ, Growl,

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.680
Kiki Kaikai, Legend of Kage, Liquid Kids, Operation Wolf.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.680
Kiki Kaikai is Puck and Rocky.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.680
Cool.

01:41:52.680 --> 01:42:00.680
Rastan, Space Invaders, Space Invaders 91, Fairyland Story, New Zealand Story, and Vulfide.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:09.680
And those are each going to be available for $59 or 49 pounds.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.680
And yeah, they've got, look like a Game Boy kind of the setup for those.

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:20.680
Plus, because they are Evercades, they also have a cartridge slot that you can plug in those Evercade cartridges.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.680
So, neato.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:29.680
Also, unrelated, sort of related, I was browsing the Evercade website because I wanted to check out the stuff.

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.680
And I found the link where you can submit possible games to be included in the cartridges.

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:36.680
Oh.

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:43.680
So, I will have to send them an email and see if they want to put a game about crap on their console.

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.680
Do it.

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:48.680
Tell them also to actively seek out Planet Harriers, the end.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.680
And the Guardian Legend.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.680
PS, yeah.

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.680
PS.

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.680
The Guardian Legend didn't have an arcade version.

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.680
But there's Nintendo games and stuff.

01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:04.680
Yeah, they're looking for NES, like, homebrew games or console homebrew games and stuff like that.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:09.680
For the record, I think you can still get Gartic, the MSX version for iOS.

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:10.680
Oh, that's cool.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:11.680
Love that.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.680
Yeah, it's not as much fun because, you know, the MSX's big drawback was scrolling.

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:18.680
It didn't like it.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.680
So, Loki reminded me when he was going through the list of the Capcom and stuff collections there for Evercade.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.680
He reminded me of my gaming week, something I played.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:31.680
And it's very, I can't believe I forgot to mention this because I thought of Dark Sakura when I did this.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:33.680
So, here's what it is.

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:40.680
So, I was at one of our, I was at the local gay bar on Friday and it happened to be gamer night.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.680
So, G-A-Y-M-E-R.

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.680
And this is, I'll say it was the Bolt.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.680
So, you know, it's a...

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.680
Oh, yeah, my friend runs that.

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680
Oh.

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.680
One of my former coworkers.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:50.680
Oh, I didn't know it was like...

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.680
I think he still does.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.680
I didn't know it was like run by, okay, well, that's cool.

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:56.680
Well, but my point is they have these different games throughout.

01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:05.680
So, usually the televisions that are playing adult movies are instead changed to play video games on gamer night.

01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:08.680
So, like Mario Karts on one TV, Smash Brothers on one TV.

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:11.680
I don't really like to play those because I, you know, whatever.

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.680
But they have a corner.

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:20.680
The other corner is the retro corner where they have an NES, excuse me, a Super Nintendo Classic and a Genesis Classic set up.

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:23.680
So, I was playing against my friend a little bit in Street Fighter.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.680
But then I went over to the Genesis and I was like, oh, I want to play Sonic Spinball.

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:31.680
But then I was like, no, I want to play at the gay bar, Strider on the Genesis.

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:32.680
Yes.

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.680
It's just like the best home version of the game.

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:40.680
And I said Dark Sakura would be so proud of me right now.

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:46.680
I'm three vodka diets in, playing Strider on the Genesis at a gay bar.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.680
Thank you very much.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.680
And hey, at least it's not the Japanese version.

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:56.680
And the NES version is not a real Strider game.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:57.680
Well, technically.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.680
It is after the Strider manga.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.680
So, it has nothing to, peripherally, only something to do with the real game.

01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:10.680
But the actual mainline Strider series.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:13.680
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.680
It's an AU.

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.680
It's a fanfic.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:18.680
You have to remember Dark Sakura.

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.680
For those of us that didn't grow up with the Sega in our house, we only had a Nintendo.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.680
That was Strider to us.

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.680
If you didn't grow up with the Sega in her house.

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.680
Fine.

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.680
But Nintendo Power didn't cover the Genesis version.

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.680
We had Nintendo and Super Nintendo.

01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:38.680
And I would switch out for a TurboGrafx every so often.

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:42.680
And I had friends with Genesis, though, so I got to play everything.

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.680
All right.

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.680
But you know that's Dan's favorite game.

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.680
Oh, no, I know.

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.680
You always tell the story about when you first got together.

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.680
He sat you down and said, you're going to beat this game.

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:55.680
Yeah, that and Castlevania Symphony of the Night is a requirement.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.680
I'm just glad he didn't make me sit down and do ghosts and goblins.

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:01.680
angels and ghosts, whichever one.

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:04.680
I know we're talking a lot about a lot about retro games tonight.

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:08.680
And of course, as the last story tonight, I have something else that has to do with retro for you.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.680
And here we go, everyone.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.680
You ready to feel old?

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:17.680
The Famicom, which, of course, led to the Nintendo Entertainment System, but it was called in Japan when it first came out.

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:28.680
The Famicom is turning 40 years old this month because it was released this month in 1983 in Japan, which, yes, it was a family computer.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:29.680
We love you.

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.680
Which, yes, was the same year that we had the game industry crash going on here in the US.

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.680
But we know that the NES ended up coming out a little bit later, and it did pretty well over here.

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:46.680
It is interesting, though, you know, I think a lot of people kind of don't realize how different the NES and the Famicom kind of like actually were.

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:54.680
Like, yes, they ran, you know, essentially the same games like, you know, with the Famicom disk system did all these different things and had the extra sound chip,

01:46:54.680 --> 01:47:00.680
which is why Metroid sounds different and a lot of games, you know, and why there was a save and load screen.

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.680
They had to do the battery pack in the US because we didn't do the disc reader here.

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:10.680
But anyways, of course, we all know the Famicom is what led to all of that, and it is turning 40 years old this week.

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:22.680
I was looking around and a website that I enjoy reading news on and Gadget was doing a little retrospective about different things that Nintendo gave us to the world through the Famicom.

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:37.680
And they listed the D pad was something new. Better third party games, which of course, that makes sense because that was a big part of like why the industry crashed the first time anyway is because anyone and everyone was making Atari games.

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.680
And there was a lot of shovelware fucking garbage on the Atari system towards the end of its run.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:48:00.680
And Nintendo infamously clamped down so that you could only make so many games in a year if you were a publisher, you were limited to three games in a year, which is why we got ended up getting things like ultra games, which was just Konami under a different name in a different country.

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:09.680
So some infamous rules there. And then of course, people ended up just bypassing the Nintendo seal of approval altogether. Ironically, one of them being Atari.

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:28.680
But anyway, console game saves was something new. The video game mascot meaning Mario being a huge mascot for the industry. That was kind of new. They also mentioned the video game movie adaptation. I'm not sure. I mean, yes, the NES did bring us to that. I don't know if I necessarily agree with that one on the list, but

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:46.680
I would have put the wizard on there versus Mario. Yes, yes. But I do agree with the light gun being on the list because how iconic was that when it first came out and duck hunt and, you know, putting the putting the thing right against the TV so you can get all the ducks. I can't believe people didn't know.

01:48:47.680 --> 01:49:12.680
But I knew this when I was a kid. I can't believe people didn't find out until recently that this whole time, the second controller will control the duck. My friends and I used to play it that way all the time. We found out an accident, but we found it. And we were like, Oh, the second person can be the duck. That's fun. And that's how we used to play duck hunt. I mean, let me also tell you this when you put when you have the tea when you have the gun right up against the screen. Controlling the duck doesn't fucking matter. It doesn't ducking matter.

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:40.680
Anyway, and they also call out the mega franchise, which I would agree with that, you know, things like Mario Brothers, Zelda, Castlevania, you know, all these games have had multiple, you know, iterations and you know, were really born on the Nintendo Entertainment System in a way that Atari 2600 in television, you know, the the ones that came before it didn't really birth franchises in the same way. So very interesting.

01:49:40.680 --> 01:50:06.680
There to see in chat says that was in the manual, at least from what I've seen of the screenshots of the manual, which just goes to show you how many people neglected to read those damn things. Because that article that clickbaity article that was going around everywhere a couple years ago about that I got duck hunt in the garage sale, so they didn't have a manual or you rented it. I thought like like 99% of Nintendo owners had a combo cartridge of Mario Brothers and duck hunt like that was the definitive. What was it the adventure pack or so it was like the definitive

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.680
way to pick up a Nintendo action action. That was it.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.680
Now my combo pack was breakthrough The Legend of Zelda and bubble bubble.

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:24.680
Weird. Okay. I do remember but if you got it like a year or two later, you might have gotten the power pack. That was Super Mario Duck hunt track me.

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:48.680
And I don't know my parents bought it. And then I don't know where they got it. But as like, it's like at seven, I think. So it was a while. There was a I would say the rarest one that I can think of is if you bought the one that had the robot, you didn't even get Mario Brothers. You had a gyro might was the right to show off the robot. That's, that's why they had Super Mario.

01:50:48.680 --> 01:51:11.680
Brothers sold independently and why it's such a rare fucking cartridge. So many people didn't need to get it because the action pack ended up being the big thing that was selling here. So it's kind of funny. Anyway, this is the part of the show where we open it up to our listeners, either through our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord, that's vognetwork.com slash discord. Or, of course, we invite your email.

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:14.680
Let me ask dark soccer if there are any emails.

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:19.680
That's a funny rub. That is hilarious.

01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:28.680
I tried the last time I assumed we didn't have one. You were like, Oh, no, there's two I was like, what? Alright, so participate at orange on radio.com.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:46.680
Someone send me an email. Just say hi. Send me something interesting. Let us know what your life is like. Yeah, actually. Can I can I ugly bag for a minute. If you've been listening to this show, and you've never emailed the show before, and you've never been here on a Sunday night. I've really never been here.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:52:10.680
Yeah, actually, can I can I ugly bag for a minute. If you've been listening to this show, and you've never emailed the show before, and you've never been here on a Sunday night. I'd really love to hear from you. And don't be shy. Like I'm a person, you're a person. I just want to know there's some other people out there that maybe we haven't heard from before. Tell, tell me your favorite video game and why it's your favorite video game and there's no wrong answers. Dark soccer, there's no wrong answers. I don't care if they say sneak king.

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:18.160
There's no wrong answers.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:46.120
Okay. Alright, yeah, email us. I just want to I just want to cordially invite those that have never emailed us before to try it out to if you've never used email before, go to gmail.com and sign up for an account. It's really easy or there's other play outlook or Yahoo if you want if you're still in the 90s. You can do all those different sites. Now folks in chat talking about

01:52:46.120 --> 01:53:15.680
Rob the robot. Yes, yes, I'm familiar with the name. I break man says the robot was one of the dumbest gaming gimmicks ever made. It wasn't very good, but it was pretty cool. Like my friend had it and I remember thinking because it actually it's spun little things that then would automatically hold like buttons down. And for gyro might it was gates, right? Like you had the little tops that would spin, and you'd put them down and they would they would basically allow the red

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:43.000
gates to the blue gates to open like it was it was. It was neat, but it was never going to go anywhere besides two games. You know, it was. So it's a it's a little piece of gaming history. And then now people in chat talking about the U force. The U force is just that's just a sign of how well Mike Tyson's punch out was received, basically. Because that thing was terrible. Anyway,

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.400
oh, yeah, it was bad.

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:54.440
We have a caller waiting in the green room and I'd love to talk to this person. So let's bring them on the air. Hello, orange lounge radio. Who am I talking to?

01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:08.520
Oh, my gosh, is this? No, it's is this the Jim Sally train? I haven't I haven't seen Sally. Yeah, I haven't heard this. Oh, my God.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:14.040
This is little Daniel. We were just watching your show hoping to get some news about Bloons TD6.

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:21.840
Oh, tell me about this. You've been talking about this because this is something that just came out and like, you were saying it was just out in Canada recently?

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:27.720
It just came out for free was on Netflix in Canada and the Bloons TD action is blowing up.

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:28.720
No.

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:39.240
So are you are you are you a big tower defense person before Bloons? Or is this like Bloons been your gateway into tower defense games?

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.040
Yeah, pretty much.

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.400
Jim Sally, is this is this your child that's also on the line?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.400
This is Daniel Sally.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:48.960
Oh, my gosh.

01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:55.680
I mean, I yeah, I don't want to be that guy. But I remember when I remember when you were born, Daniel.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.080
Yeah, Rob was right there.

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:08.440
Was not right there. But yeah, I yeah, that's funny. What? Daniel, what do you like about Bloons?

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.520
I don't know. It's funny.

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:13.120
It is fun.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.240
Fides that we've been doing.

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.880
A lot of weird little secrets.

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:24.640
That was a whoopee cushion ever whoopee cushion.

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:30.640
I would I would expect the Jim Sally's house. There's a whoopee cushion. Yes.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.400
There's a few.

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.680
Anyway, we're gonna let you go.

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:38.520
Thanks for the entertainment tonight.

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:44.440
It is so good to hear from you both and happy gaming and here's hoping a Bloons TD seven is out soon.

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:46.120
How are you guys?

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.480
Take care, guys. We'll be there.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:50.640
Bye, Jim Sally. Bye, Dan Sally.

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:52.680
Bye.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:24.600
That was adorable. It's how many years I'd like the last time Jim Sally called into this program was, I think he's done it on Discord once. But I remember like when Skype went away, he was somebody that used to call in a lot on Skype. And obviously we had to get rid of that because Skype, I think I know some of you miss it dearly. But even Skype is like aging as it like it's getting folded into teens and all this stuff. At least the business version is but Skype had a lot of technical problems that made it difficult

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:45.320
to incorporate into the show. And obviously Discord makes it very easy in this day and age. So we moved it over there. But yeah, I feel like it's been forever since we've heard Jim Sally. What a pleasant surprise. And then of course, now everybody in chat. Break Man is saying I must be high, really, really high. Matt says, I'm aging so fast that I'm dying. Jim Sally's kid is calling in.

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.520
How old is Julian now though?

01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.960
Oh, Julian is a teenager easily.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:57:00.600
Yeah, no, he's a think turning 15. I have to ask Becky for sure. We need to get Julian back on some point.

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:07.360
No bigger. Yeah. And Julian, by the but the next time we have Julian on this show, Julian's voice probably more like this now that he's

01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.000
crackly.

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:12.320
Gonna be the wild part.

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:21.360
Last time I talked to him now. And he would come over and play the Dungeons and Dragons on Saturn.

01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:23.920
What in the staria?

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.720
That's awesome. Yeah.

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:38.960
It's just all the like, kiddos like, and even some of our, you know, contemporaries now I should say our peers. How old were they when we met them?

01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.000
Oh, well, I was

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.200
and now they're, you know,

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:56.240
when I first met Shane, who's now like one of my closest friends, but you know, we met, you know, with LiveJournal was really where it started. And then you know, OLR because he was a big Bamani fan as well. Um, I first met Shane when he was 19.

01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:58.560
What about Drew?

01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:12.880
Oh, God. Was Drew wasn't Drew like 17 when he was first going to golf? Yeah. My goodness. Yeah. But I was gonna say Shane just, Shane just turned 40. I've noticed that he was 19. Yeah, it's a long time.

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:14.600
Whoo.

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:15.680
Make me cold here.

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.280
I know.

01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:19.480
Oh my God, what am I gonna do when I turn 50?

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:22.640
Same thing we always do plan to take over the world.

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:27.040
Stretch, kick and stretch because you're 50.

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.160
Because I'm 50 years old.

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:29.560
No.

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.680
Ask Travis Donovan.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:43.240
If I keep up, maybe I'll be on point when I am 50. Wouldn't that be rad? And not looking any different to skincare?

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:50.400
I'm still hoping I mean, I may have like the fully gray beard at this point. I blame the pandemic for that. But I

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.320
It's just for men, Rad.

01:58:52.480 --> 01:59:01.320
I don't you know, I'm not big on paying for that stuff. Because I think an industry that makes its money off people's insecurities, but it's

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.040
Oh, I think you can do like purple.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:10.400
Oh, you want me to do like a crazy like a drag king beard? You may have like a drag king beard? Like a purple glitter beard? Okay.

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:25.360
Well, it doesn't have to be glitter. Glitter gets everywhere. But I was just telling my friend Shiley, you know, if Helen Mirren could dye her hair pastel pink and wear it to the award shows, we can do whatever the fuck we want to with our hair.

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:39.960
No, for sure. I love I love Helen Mirren. No, I any anytime you feel like just because you're old, you can't have fun anymore. You just have to look at people like Judi Dench. Like what would Judi Dench do? What would Patrick Stewart do? What would Ian McKellen do?

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:44.480
It's gonna be okay. All right.

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:54.960
I'm just I'm just gonna try to embrace my drunk auntie of Twitch persona. Yeah, that's me. I'm everyone's auntie.

01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:04.920
Um, can I tell a really funny story? Actually, since we're running, we're running a little short and I do we have any last minute stories? Loki, let's get to that. And then we'll get to the okay.

02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:09.920
All I got to do is wipe my makeup off before my stream because I'm vtubing.

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:34.280
Okay, I'm gonna tell a really funny story already. So we had a bumper tonight. So you know, before we have Orange Launch Radio, there's always like a little you can't do that on television bumper that plays before the show, right? There's a like, little parody type of thing. It's like Dragon Con TV and all that stuff, too. So tonight's the joke was about the FTC finally learning how to play video games,

02:00:34.280 --> 02:01:03.320
because the long running joke is that they're old and out of touch. So I wanted to use clip art of like grandma and grandpa playing a Wii at the senior center as the clip art for that. And I found something kind of close. But when I was first searching for clip art of the right resolution, because that's be a good enough resolution, or it looks like a potato when it's coming out on the feed. When I was first looking, I was like, Okay, I'm not really getting the clip art I want. What if I Google search for? I'm even going to do this live on air. Hold on, hold on.

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:06.920
I know what this is.

02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:34.040
What if I Google search? Okay, how do I do the other screen here? I'm new at that. Okay, what if I Google search old people playing Atari, and I go to the image search and I go okay, old people playing Atari, and I look at the images that come up for old people playing Atari. If you look at the results for old people playing Atari, and you scroll down just a little bit, I just want to point out one of the pictures that comes

02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:38.920
up. It's Mel B of DDR freak fame.

02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:40.760
Wait, who's that next to?

02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:57.400
That's, that's Kath. Have you met Kath before? She's another friend. She's another friend of mine. Yeah, but I think if she's ever been on the show, it's only been one time. So listeners probably don't know her as well. But I know some of our old school listeners know Mel B. And so you know what I had to do, right? I immediately

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:00.200
immediately texted his wife.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:11.960
I'm gonna do that like you suggested. It's just a message. Melody when I'm at work, and go, old people playing Atari.

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:19.160
The two of us have not been able to stop laughing all day. I'm gonna text her right now. Old people playing Atari.

02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:23.960
I'm gonna text her right now. Melody. There she is.

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:31.720
Just did. Let's see if I get a reply.

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:42.280
Like if I could only, like, I shouldn't be reading private messages on the show. But you know what, if you are friends with me, then that's something that might happen once in a while.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:03:11.080
So what so I texted it to Miss Mel. And her reply was, I'm scream laughing at a gas station in the middle of nowhere. And then I put I'm crying. And then she texts back like 15 minutes later. I'm driving north on the set with Siri. So she's dictating as she's driving. She says, I'm driving north on the five and I thought back to the image search and I got the giggles all over again. And I start laughing. So now I'm just like, that's, I'm going to just Google.

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:14.760
Text her out of nowhere. Old people playing Atari.

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:19.800
I'm in internaling plotting.

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:30.760
It's, it's great. It's I want a t shirt that says old people playing Atari. Can we make that vog merchandise? Yeah, I'd love that.

02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:31.920
I can make that happen.

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:57.000
Because here's the other funny thing. That picture could have very easily actually, I want to say, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Old people. Well, I, I don't want to do it, Darsire, because it's an old picture. If you click on the picture, and you look at associated images, I'm almost positive I saw you posing with some other people because it was Atari party. So it's looking for related images from Atari party. And that that's where his picture.

02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:13.280
Yeah, it's because the article was like, Atari party draws young and old to oh, yeah, no retro game. It's it. Like when you if you critically think about how that image came up in the Google search, it makes sense. It's just really fucking funny.

02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:15.080
Yeah.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.960
Because that could have just as easily been any of us in that picture.

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:41.160
You want to know how the first way I ever heard of Mel, by the way, was on the DDR internet ranking. Back in the day, my God, that's right. His name up in his location was, I'll say it, Milpena's cock land.

02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.560
Because that's what they used to call MGL Milpena's golf land. Yeah, that's what they used to call it.

02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.480
Well, I mean,

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.520
you heard what I said?

02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:04.280
No, I definitely heard what you said. But yeah, it's it's a loving nickname. All right, well, on that note on that Nick node, you know,

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:07.520
okay, and don't look at those pictures with me there before my surgery.

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:19.760
Slowly, we are all turning into old people playing Atari. Old people playing Atari is I refuse. I refuse. You're like, no, no, old people playing Coleco for life.

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:28.800
I'm vintage and kitschy. Okay. I can say I'm vintage. That's right. Fine wine, not sour grapes.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:38.200
All right, let's get everybody's final thought. And then we're gonna wrap up Dark Soccer. I'll start with you. I know you're gonna presto change and do your own stream. But Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:51.480
Um, I'm gonna have a Shay with me tonight. And we all know that Shay is chaos. We love chaos. So come join us in the fog and judge my new vtuber era.

02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:52.280
Well fixie be there.

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:57.960
I'm on camera for you guys. But I'm gonna be vtubing so I can take off this makeup.

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.280
Is fixie gonna be there too? Are they joining?

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:04.920
I didn't see fixie online, but I'll actually I'll give them a poke.

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:10.360
I'm just curious if it's all you know, the squad, the bully squad, not really bully squad, the, you know,

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:18.760
well, Gwen hasn't been playing for a while. Apparently not really having the will to play. But I know Gwen's also going through a really hard time.

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:22.320
Well, hoping hoping all is improving. So

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Yeah, um, and also, I just want to make a mention. I'm not gonna gonna name names, but it was the first person who interviewed me at my job.

02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:48.600
And a manager friend. I've been on his team for a while, but he, he died very recently, left behind an infant and his wife. I'm going in August to their memorial.

02:06:49.480 --> 02:07:00.240
But I just want to say that for anyone who knows me and probably knows who I'm talking about, you will be missed. You were one of us. And may your memory be a blessing.

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:03.400
All right. Any other

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.280
happy notes to end on?

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:19.480
Um, Dan made really good teriyaki chicken. But because it was 106 outside the chicken cooked weird. So it's got this myard browning on it to the extreme.

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:29.200
But it's really delicious and very nutritious. And I also have lost half an inch on my thigh from doing ballet.

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:32.200
Nice. All right. Food and

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:34.000
It's not why I'm doing it, but it's happened.

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.680
All right. Take care, have a good stream.

02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:38.560
Good news, right? Positive news.

02:07:38.760 --> 02:08:03.960
All right. Let's go over to Well, actually, before we wrap up, wrap up, let me also say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lawn Radio and supporting us. We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices to put out here on air. So tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever you found this show all goes an awful long way as well. So we really appreciate those of you that go the

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:29.120
extra mile and get your friends here to participate as well. We will be back next week for episode 969. Yes, very nice number back and forth. So we'll, we'll be here with that episode. And then we'll have a break. Because again, I'm going out to Southern fried gaming Expo in two weeks. And then yes, going back to Atlanta. I'm racking up those airline miles, except I'm flying once on one airline and flying again on another airline because I'm going to Dragon

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:52.560
Con. The second time I'm going it's me and Alan. Both going to Dragon Con this year, Alan's first Dragon Con. And I even asked him the other day I said, So what do you hope to do at Dragon Con? He's like, Oh, no, let's roll with it. Like, okay. All right. Uh, we'll be back next week, though. So I hope you'll be here as well. Uh, final thoughts, Loki.

02:08:53.440 --> 02:09:02.240
I'm just gonna keep being busy with video editing. Yeah, a lot to do for the last three episodes of the season.

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:31.240
My final thought is I have major side quest cleanup and Final Fantasy 16 still that I want to get to. That is very important, but also very excited Diablo four season one. Looking forward to that starting on Thursday. So I'll be streaming that over on my personal stream at Rob Roberts here on Twitch. I don't know if I'll, I don't know what I'm going to play to fill in the gap. In the meantime, I have a couple days where I have nothing, but I have theater them DLC, I can do that. I'll probably do theater the one day, but then I'm not sure I wanted to do like Alan Wake remastered.

02:09:32.240 --> 02:10:02.240
But I don't think I have enough time before the Diablo season. So that'll probably be a game I play after a few streams of Diablo four season one. Unfortunately, I missed the no man's sky expedition. I did the one stream on my birthday and I cleared the first set of challenges. But unfortunately, that expedition ended on July 12. And I never was able to play it again because I was too busy playing Final Fantasy 16. But there are worst ways to be lost in space. So on that note, thank you everybody for listening to Orange

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:32.240
Lounge Radio. We will see you again in seven days. Have a wonderful night. Thank you and goodbye.

02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:38.240
This is not the news of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
