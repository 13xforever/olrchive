00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
The Switch successor conversation has been steadily growing and it was reported that

00:13.240 --> 00:15.840
Nintendo's CEO stated during a shareholders meeting that,

00:15.840 --> 00:18.900
In the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next generation console, we would like

00:18.900 --> 00:22.580
to make every effort to ensure the customers can make the transition smoothly while using

00:22.580 --> 00:23.580
their Nintendo account.

00:23.580 --> 00:24.580
What does that mean?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.520
That Nintendo is making a new console!

00:26.520 --> 00:28.640
And nothing else set in stone.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.840
This is the news to no one headline, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie

00:31.840 --> 00:34.600
Summers and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming

00:34.600 --> 00:35.600
news.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.360
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.360 --> 00:44.500
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.500 --> 00:46.420
every gamer has a voice.

00:46.420 --> 00:54.400
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 966 of our

00:54.400 --> 00:58.600
show for tonight, July the 2nd of 2023.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.080
I know it's a long weekend for some folks, but we're still here anyway.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.120
I'm here, Rob Roberts, with you every week with my co-hosts.

01:06.120 --> 01:10.040
Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
Hi.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
Hello, hello.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.600
How are you doing?

01:14.600 --> 01:21.640
We live in the devil's parched dry chapped asshole.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.640
We don't live in Phoenix.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.480
What are you talking about?

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
No.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.200
That one is the cursed parched dry asshole.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.360
Oh, I see.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.360
I see.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.400
Thank you for the clarification.

01:33.400 --> 01:39.760
Right now it's 101, so it's better than it was earlier, but we hit 108 again today.

01:39.760 --> 01:46.960
Thankfully, it's going to be in the 80s, I think by the 4th, but if you live in a place

01:46.960 --> 01:52.840
with vaulted ceilings, blink, blink, it does not stay cool.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.880
Vaulted ceilings are not your friend.

01:55.880 --> 02:03.720
I was enjoying our nice, mild June because it actually, this is the first year I can

02:03.720 --> 02:09.520
think of in a long time where it has not hit 100 degrees in all of June in our lovely Sacramento,

02:09.520 --> 02:12.160
California where we're all at.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.040
I was like, oh, this is the site of climate change I can deal with.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.880
If that means we're going to have moderate summers, okay.

02:20.920 --> 02:24.720
It sucks about the floods, but you know, okay, at least we, and then nope, nope, here we

02:24.720 --> 02:31.720
are right back to the, you know, Satan's taint or whatever you refer to it as is very much

02:31.720 --> 02:33.960
in progress for sure.

02:33.960 --> 02:39.200
Well, people were calling it like the, you know, damp asshole or like, no, no, no, that's

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
Alabama.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.080
It's not damp here.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.720
It's not damp.

02:45.720 --> 02:50.400
And yeah, Mike, I understand it's harder where you are, but I mean, going from it having

02:50.440 --> 02:59.480
been no hotter than like 85 to an immediate triple digit is a bit of a fast change and

02:59.480 --> 03:02.200
I am not looking forward to my power bill.

03:02.200 --> 03:08.840
I, it, you can't, it's, I cannot sleep when I'm hot and I also have this thing where I

03:08.840 --> 03:14.360
have to have 50 bajillion blankets on me to be able to sleep kind of like having a weighted

03:14.360 --> 03:16.680
blanket, but not quite.

03:16.680 --> 03:21.800
It's been a very interesting, I'm, I'm, I, I needed help sleeping.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Thank you.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
You cancel it.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.120
You can't set your ingredients.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.880
You can't sleep when you're hot.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.400
No, but you're hot all the time.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
Oh girl.

03:30.400 --> 03:36.280
Well, I know that, but I mean, temperature wise, I actually, okay.

03:36.280 --> 03:41.600
You know, you know how, how ice cream makes me really sick now.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.840
I didn't care.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.320
I ate an entire chocolate shake.

03:46.320 --> 03:52.880
That was actually, that was me this week eating KFC because I realized the Diablo four promotion

03:52.880 --> 03:53.880
ended today.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.080
And I was like, Oh, I should probably go eat some KFC.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.240
And then I remembered, Oh, there's a reason I don't eat KFC.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.560
And that would be terrible.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.720
The food is the reason I don't eat at KFC anyway.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.580
I liked their fries for a long time, but you know, why could, I mean, I understand why

04:09.580 --> 04:12.320
in your case, but in general, why go to KFC?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.640
If you have a jolly bee near you.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.760
Or even, even Popeyes.

04:15.760 --> 04:16.760
I'll take Popeyes.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
No, no, no.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.760
Why?

04:18.760 --> 04:19.760
Why go to Popeyes when you have a jolly?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
Cause I don't have a jolly bean.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
Yes, you do.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.760
Rob.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.080
It's all the way down near you.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
Well now.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.080
Oh no.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.160
The new thing is, um, raising canes is everywhere, right?

04:29.160 --> 04:30.160
Even that jolly bee.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
All right.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.160
All right.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.160
It's all about the chicken.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.160
Joy.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
All right.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.600
Look, I need a, I need a outside fast food opinion on this and who better to bring in

04:38.600 --> 04:40.360
then tech master Loki.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.360
Hello.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.360
Hi.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
Where should I get chicken?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.360
Uh, bonds.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
Oh, of course.

04:45.960 --> 04:46.960
You'd say that.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.960
Of course you'd say that's, that's expensive.

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
That's designed.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.960
It's a Korean chicken place.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.960
Oh, I mean, that's different.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.280
Korean fried chicken is completely different.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.560
I'm just talking about like, that's the KFC I want.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.360
They have the cracked chicken, which I don't know what they put on it.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.080
It's probably cracked because it's white and powdery.

05:04.080 --> 05:10.200
So, you know, but it's, uh, some sort of like dust that they put on it that's sugary.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.000
And I think it's like sugary or parmesani or something.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't know what it is.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
They won't say what it is.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.640
It's cracked, but like, it's good.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
Okay.

05:17.640 --> 05:25.760
Um, I have one place that will last, last message, message that mention of it in Oakland

05:25.760 --> 05:33.560
on Telegraph near the, the, the original, uh, KP market, there's a place called OB town.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.100
It looks like a little former fast food restaurant hole in the wall.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.520
They have the best true KFC.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.520
Okay.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.520
End of story.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.800
Well, uh, another vote for a fried chicken in our chat, uh, from DJ Rama S because we

05:45.800 --> 05:49.840
do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific at the voice geeks

05:49.840 --> 05:55.400
network twitch.tv slash a VOG network right after the Bobby black Wolf show, uh, except

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
not tonight.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.040
Bobby black Wolf is enjoying the long holiday weekend, but Bobby will be back next week.

06:00.040 --> 06:06.200
And I will be with Bobby black Wolf in Atlanta, Georgia at the end of July for the Southern

06:06.200 --> 06:10.540
fried speaking of chicken, Southern fried gaming expo, which is happening at the end

06:10.540 --> 06:11.540
of July.

06:11.540 --> 06:13.660
Uh, so stay tuned for that.

06:13.660 --> 06:17.460
Uh, but I want to get to do Jerome S who says, cause I do agree with this.

06:17.460 --> 06:23.220
Do Jerome S says, uh, forget Raising Cane's hit up a local Halal fried chicken restaurant,

06:23.220 --> 06:25.900
cheaper and better tasting true.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.340
Some of the best fried chicken.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.340
Okay.

06:29.340 --> 06:36.660
However, that place in Rancho Cordova by the target, uh, is not there anymore.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.700
I know I ate there.

06:38.700 --> 06:42.400
And I was like, that is that, that was as good as the fried chicken at Disneyland.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
It really was.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.400
I ate those.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
Like that was amazing.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.520
Four weeks later gone.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.560
And I was like, of course, because I liked it.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.740
That's what happens to things I like.

06:50.740 --> 06:51.900
I don't get to keep them.

06:51.900 --> 06:52.900
Yeah.

06:52.900 --> 06:56.060
I'd gone there before because they had chicken and waffles, but they were okay.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.060
They weren't great.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.060
I love them.

06:58.060 --> 07:02.180
I mean, I'm even going to say that I like as much as I love Roscoe's.

07:02.180 --> 07:09.740
I'm even going to say, okay, Roscoe's is kind of up at the top for me because as, as a Southern

07:09.740 --> 07:15.980
girl, I know my fried chicken and I know my soul food.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.840
It's it's chicken.

07:17.840 --> 07:27.420
The chicken from Roscoe's with a big plate of grits is heaven followed only by fried

07:27.420 --> 07:28.420
chicken liver.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.420
If someone will eat it with me.

07:29.420 --> 07:30.420
Okay.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.420
Last thought.

07:31.420 --> 07:34.580
I love Roscoe's, but since you brought up Roscoe's, it makes me laugh because did you

07:34.580 --> 07:39.420
know in the gayborhood, they opened the old spot that used to be hot rods.

07:39.420 --> 07:44.900
And it's now like a brunch bar called Roscoe's, but it has nothing to do, no, it has nothing

07:44.900 --> 07:45.900
to do with it.

07:45.900 --> 07:46.900
It's for drag brunch.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.900
That's what it is.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.900
So it cracked me up.

07:48.900 --> 07:53.860
Cause I'm like, now when you say Roscoe's people think of that place, so can we, can

07:53.860 --> 07:54.860
we go to drag brunch?

07:54.860 --> 07:55.860
Of course.

07:55.860 --> 07:56.860
There's like 50 of them here.

07:56.860 --> 07:57.860
Yeah, of course.

07:57.860 --> 08:02.860
I probably know a performer at every one of them somehow.

08:02.860 --> 08:04.580
It's a small town sometimes.

08:04.580 --> 08:10.180
So well, yeah, but I haven't been to drag brunch in like age, age, age, ages.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.180
You want to do drag brunch?

08:11.180 --> 08:12.420
You want to do drag dinner?

08:12.420 --> 08:13.420
You want to do?

08:13.420 --> 08:15.740
I want to do all the drags.

08:15.740 --> 08:17.860
Sunday best of the week.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.700
We could do a drag tee.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.700
We can do that.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.700
You name it.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.660
Do we get, do we get to spill it?

08:23.660 --> 08:24.660
Yes.

08:24.660 --> 08:25.660
All right.

08:25.660 --> 08:26.660
We spilled tea at the drag tee.

08:26.660 --> 08:30.140
Well, we're going to spill some tea right here at the top of the show because this is

08:30.140 --> 08:35.380
a company that I talk a lot about on the show and unfortunately they hit some pretty bad

08:35.380 --> 08:39.900
news this week, but I think some of us might've seen this coming a little bit.

08:39.900 --> 08:44.420
This is a tricky, tricky topic cause I know people and I indirectly know people that were

08:44.420 --> 08:45.460
affected by this.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.260
So this kind of sucks.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.180
But I have some things to say about it.

08:49.180 --> 08:52.480
Loki, did you want to start us off with the headline and what's going on here?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
What I'm referring to?

08:53.480 --> 08:59.400
So Niantic is shutting down their Los Angeles studio and they're moving away from in-house

08:59.400 --> 09:01.960
game development.

09:01.960 --> 09:07.360
The Pokemon Go studio, they're laying off 230 employees.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.720
NBA All World is being shut down.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.720
Oh my God.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.880
It wasn't popular.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.720
That's surprising.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.520
And they're also canceling the upcoming Marvel World of Heroes game that they were going

09:18.520 --> 09:23.240
to be putting out as well, which I mean, honestly, they have way too many games going at one

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
time.

09:24.240 --> 09:32.040
They said, I guess, in internal email to the employees, they said that the expenses grew

09:32.040 --> 09:35.040
faster than revenue.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.560
And I mean, that makes sense.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.520
We also bear the responsibility for our performance.

09:40.520 --> 09:49.240
Today's highly competitive mobile gaming market requires dazzling quality and innovation.

09:49.240 --> 09:55.560
It's also requires strong monetization and a social core, which can drive viral growth

09:55.560 --> 09:57.120
and long term engagement.

09:57.120 --> 10:03.560
Teams need to need platform tools that force multipliers, enabling them to build at the

10:03.560 --> 10:07.560
highest quality with powerful engagement features quickly and efficiently.

10:07.560 --> 10:13.760
Our AR map and platform must deliver the features that developers want in a robust, reliable

10:13.760 --> 10:14.760
way.

10:14.760 --> 10:18.720
We have not met the goals in any of these areas.

10:18.720 --> 10:23.640
I just think you had poor monetization for some of that stuff.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.640
I don't know.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.840
You're kind of a little too greedy in some areas.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.800
And yeah, lack of innovation.

10:28.800 --> 10:35.520
You keep putting out games that aside from giving a new paint job, they weren't really

10:35.520 --> 10:36.520
worthwhile to play.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.960
It wasn't like Pokemon Go.

10:37.960 --> 10:43.720
They're trying to get that success, but it just wasn't happening.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.320
So I have a few things to say on this because, you know, I've been following Niantic a long

10:47.320 --> 10:48.320
time, right?

10:49.320 --> 10:53.840
I was in the beta for Pokemon Go because I'd played their other game, Ingress, for quite

10:53.840 --> 10:54.840
a long time.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.620
In fact, one of my favorite episodes we ever did of this show was back when we were all

10:58.620 --> 10:59.620
in person.

10:59.620 --> 11:04.360
You might remember at Studio N7, we actually brought some of the ladies that I played Ingress

11:04.360 --> 11:05.360
with in for a show.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.960
I want to say it was in January of one year.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
We all were in studio.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.400
That was a really fun show because they love that game.

11:12.400 --> 11:17.160
The sad thing is, though, I think only one of them that was here still plays regularly.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.880
The other ones have kind of, you know, gone off into retirement, but that game has been

11:19.880 --> 11:25.640
around for like, you know, that game is celebrated 10 years, actually, this last year.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.600
So yeah, I've been following this company for a long time.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.740
So I have some thoughts on this for sure.

11:30.740 --> 11:33.960
So here's the thing.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.920
Why is Niantic struggling as a gaming company?

11:37.920 --> 11:42.260
And I would like to share with you my thoughts on the answer to this Niantic is struggling

11:42.260 --> 11:48.500
as a gaming company because Niantic is not a gaming company.

11:48.500 --> 11:54.660
And in this TED Talk, I will explain to you the reasons why I believe Niantic has unfortunately

11:54.660 --> 12:00.480
allowed the scope to grow too big from what they really wanted to do and allowed this

12:00.480 --> 12:03.980
situation to happen in the first place.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.980
Let's start.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.560
I'm not joking, bitch, by the way.

12:09.560 --> 12:13.400
Let's start by going to Niantic's website.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.540
Let's take a look and talk.

12:15.540 --> 12:18.840
Let's see what Niantic has to say about the games that they're making.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.900
Of course, we have an ad for Peridot, their newest game, right?

12:22.900 --> 12:28.740
And then we get down and you expect on a mobile game developer's website, you're going to

12:28.740 --> 12:34.800
see something about their statement about making fun games or making accessible games

12:34.800 --> 12:38.520
or making games you want to play, games as a part of our life.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.200
Well, look, here it is.

12:40.200 --> 12:44.300
Here's the Niantic mission statement right here at the bottom of NianticLabs.com.

12:44.300 --> 12:47.680
What if augmented reality could make us better?

12:47.680 --> 12:50.680
Could it nudge us off the couch for a Saturday in the park?

12:50.680 --> 12:55.080
Could it draw us into public space and into contact with neighbors we might never have

12:55.080 --> 12:56.260
met?

12:56.260 --> 12:57.660
We believe it can.

12:57.660 --> 12:59.160
Join us.

12:59.160 --> 13:04.960
Now, I didn't see anything in that statement that actually related to games.

13:04.960 --> 13:10.160
I saw things in that statement that related to other cool things.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.160
And here's the thing.

13:11.160 --> 13:17.280
I would not support Niantic as long as I have if I did not think they had some good ideas.

13:17.280 --> 13:23.880
And all that stuff in there is cool stuff like, yeah, it's fun to go outside and play,

13:23.880 --> 13:26.840
mix up fitness with gaming.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.080
A lot of that stuff is crucial to me.

13:29.080 --> 13:35.040
So I'm not necessarily razzing Niantic for that statement, but I am pointing out Niantic

13:35.040 --> 13:39.600
did not start out to be a game company.

13:39.600 --> 13:45.200
Continuing on, let's consider who is at the top of Niantic right now.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
John Hankey, right?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.280
Now, look, here's the thing about John Hankey.

13:48.280 --> 13:52.480
I actually think he's a pretty intelligent guy and he's done a lot of stuff.

13:52.480 --> 13:57.680
Disclaimer, I once met the guy and I did a Pokemon raid with him, but it was a chance

13:57.680 --> 14:00.440
meeting and so forth with this whole thing.

14:00.440 --> 14:06.120
But what is John Hankey's gaming background?

14:06.120 --> 14:12.760
What are the games that he developed before running Niantic quickly?

14:12.760 --> 14:14.520
You probably don't know.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.320
That's because he made one.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.320
He helped with one.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.320
It was a game called Meridian 59.

14:20.320 --> 14:24.080
That was for the 3DO company.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.200
Yeah, but Meridian 59, well, it is still around today, actually.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.080
So for all intents and purposes, I can't sit here and say, oh, Meridian 59 was a flop.

14:33.080 --> 14:39.440
It was one of the first graphically multiplayer games, long, long running.

14:39.440 --> 14:44.280
It may actually not be around anymore, but the game did have impact.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.240
He was not the only person behind the game, but it did have impact.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.080
That's not what he's known for.

14:49.080 --> 14:54.760
John Hankey is known for Google Earth, Google Maps, Street View, and then some other things,

14:54.760 --> 14:58.600
you know, Panoramio, which is where people are taking the panoramas within Google Maps

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
and all that stuff.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.800
Now, I love Street View.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.280
I love Google Maps.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.760
And I think that was innovative.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.480
That was like, that was big stuff, you know?

15:09.480 --> 15:11.360
So again, the guy's got the resume.

15:11.360 --> 15:17.480
But when it comes to gaming, it hasn't really worked on a lot, a lot of games.

15:17.480 --> 15:22.360
So where did Niantic come from in the first place?

15:22.360 --> 15:26.800
I mentioned that Ingress was the first game that they did, but you might forget that before

15:26.800 --> 15:30.380
Ingress, they actually did an app called Field Trip.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.540
Field Trip wasn't a game.

15:32.540 --> 15:37.200
Field Trip was a location-based mobile app, which was your guide to cool, hidden, and

15:37.200 --> 15:39.320
unique things in the world around you.

15:39.320 --> 15:48.560
Ingress set out to gamify that because Ingress, as it was, or excuse me, Niantic as it was,

15:48.560 --> 15:57.920
was set up not to become a gaming company, Niantic was set up to take this Google Map

15:57.920 --> 16:04.560
stuff one step further and go back to their mission statement, be a part of augmented

16:04.560 --> 16:08.360
reality and making the world around you better.

16:08.400 --> 16:12.280
Field Trip was the first attempt to map all that stuff out.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.560
Ingress then gamified it to make people want to do it more because Field Trip didn't end

16:16.560 --> 16:18.320
up lasting long.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.920
And then what happened after that?

16:20.920 --> 16:26.160
Ingress got actually a lot bigger in Japan than it even is here, and it caught the attention

16:26.160 --> 16:28.880
of some key people at Nintendo.

16:28.880 --> 16:34.760
And it became, remember, Google Maps, going back to something John Hanke is familiar with,

16:34.760 --> 16:38.320
when Niantic was still with Google, because remember Niantic was actually a Google company

16:38.320 --> 16:39.320
at first, right?

16:39.320 --> 16:43.760
Sorry, I know you could have a whole graph going with this thing, but bear with me here.

16:43.760 --> 16:51.920
So Niantic makes Pokemon Go as a result of the success of Ingress, the ideas that were

16:51.920 --> 16:57.000
there, the Google Maps thing kind of leading to a tihi, wouldn't this be a cute idea?

16:57.000 --> 17:01.040
And sure enough, they did launch this cute idea.

17:01.040 --> 17:06.520
And then what happens after that?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.240
Get too big for their britches.

17:08.240 --> 17:14.640
Pokemon Go gets way bigger than anyone could have ever expected.

17:14.640 --> 17:22.720
Even to Niantic's comments, even to anybody else out there, Pokemon Go got way bigger

17:22.720 --> 17:24.440
than anyone anticipated.

17:24.440 --> 17:29.440
As Mike Deft puts it in chat, remember when we reached world peace seven years ago?

17:29.440 --> 17:36.280
Yes, summer of 2016, it's all been downhill from there in history.

17:36.280 --> 17:45.240
The summer of Pokemon Go was the climax of human civilization.

17:45.240 --> 17:52.920
And then it's been a slow decline from there, the pandemic and Trump and so on and so on

17:52.920 --> 17:55.360
from there.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.500
So Pokemon Go gets really, really big.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.660
And then, of course, what happens from there?

18:00.660 --> 18:04.840
Now it's, oh, my God, we've got lightning in a bottle.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.980
We've got to replicate this lightning in a bottle.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.900
Now we've got Pikmin.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.100
Now we've got Harry Potter.

18:12.100 --> 18:21.880
Now we've got Marvel, Catan, Marvel, all these games trying to replicate the success of something

18:21.880 --> 18:26.780
that I argue can probably no longer be replicated because the world has changed.

18:29.300 --> 18:34.220
And that's how we got into the situation that we're in today with Niantic is that they were

18:34.220 --> 18:41.880
forced, essentially, beyond what they were setting out to do, to be a gaming company.

18:41.880 --> 18:47.980
They were under that immense amount of pressure from everybody, investors and so forth, to

18:47.980 --> 18:50.820
replicate the success of Pokemon Go.

18:50.820 --> 18:54.940
But that's not what Niantic ever had set out to do.

18:54.940 --> 18:59.540
Niantic wanted to get into this augmented reality thing.

18:59.540 --> 19:04.460
And I mean, if you really think about it, going back to Google Maps leading to Street

19:04.460 --> 19:07.740
View, what's one step beyond Street View?

19:07.740 --> 19:13.360
Getting to all the places the cars can't go, looking at where people go when they walk

19:13.360 --> 19:17.820
and mapping when they walk and the cool things they interact with when they walk, which is

19:17.820 --> 19:25.500
literally the gameplay loop in Pikmin Bloom, which was spared from the axe, by the way,

19:25.500 --> 19:26.500
if you noticed.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.460
I'm sure you're really happy about that.

19:30.460 --> 19:34.180
I am because actually, and I do, and I've been very open about this.

19:34.180 --> 19:39.980
I credit Pikmin Bloom coming at the right time with motivating me to lose the weight.

19:39.980 --> 19:44.340
So that's why even though, yes, I'm being a little bit critical of how we ended up in

19:44.340 --> 19:47.300
this situation, I actually do root for Niantic.

19:47.780 --> 19:48.780
I want them to succeed.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.260
I want to see them be successful.

19:50.260 --> 19:58.540
But the problem is they have literally hinged their entire lifeline on that mission statement

19:58.540 --> 20:02.540
that I read to you earlier from their website.

20:02.540 --> 20:06.340
One more thing I want to add to this, Loki already touched on it, but I want to bold

20:06.340 --> 20:08.500
it and underline it.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.040
Why did this happen?

20:11.040 --> 20:15.660
There are internal, I'm reading from the organizational update that Loki cited earlier.

20:15.660 --> 20:18.220
There are internal and external factors.

20:18.220 --> 20:23.900
We're in a tough market environment due to the overall global macroeconomics slowdown.

20:23.900 --> 20:27.020
We'll never achieve 2016 again.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.500
Unique challenges in the mobile gaming and AR markets.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.540
I think that's kind of fluff, but sure.

20:32.540 --> 20:36.740
In the years since Pokémon GO's launch, the mobile market has become crowded, imitators,

20:36.740 --> 20:39.540
knockoffs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

20:39.540 --> 20:44.020
We also face an AR market that's developing more slowly than anticipated because the technology

20:44.020 --> 20:48.900
changes and because larger players are slowing down their investments in light of the macro

20:48.900 --> 20:49.900
environment.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.020
I think that's trying to say that people were going outside less during the pandemic.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.660
I think.

20:55.660 --> 21:00.300
We also bear responsibility for our own performance.

21:00.300 --> 21:04.960
Today's highly competitive mobile gaming market requires dazzling quality and innovation.

21:04.960 --> 21:09.100
It also requires strong monetization and a social core, which can drive viral growth

21:09.100 --> 21:11.260
and long-term engagement.

21:11.260 --> 21:16.580
Games need platform tools that are force multipliers, enabling them to build at the

21:16.580 --> 21:23.060
highest quality with powerful engagement features quickly and efficiently.

21:23.060 --> 21:26.700
Bold this, underline this, italicize this.

21:26.700 --> 21:33.460
Our AR map and platform must deliver the features that developers want in a robust and reliable

21:33.460 --> 21:36.200
way.

21:36.200 --> 21:41.360
Isn't that interesting that that ultimately ends up being the emphasis?

21:41.360 --> 21:43.260
Not.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.040
We need to make better games.

21:46.040 --> 21:53.420
The game loop is the re- you know, the, the, the, um, the monetization needs to be fun

21:53.420 --> 21:57.940
and the game needs to be, uh, you know, things that people want to play and it's a competitive

21:57.940 --> 21:58.940
environment.

21:58.940 --> 22:03.520
Yes, that, that is what went wrong, but that is not what they illustrate as what they need

22:03.520 --> 22:05.820
to do moving forward.

22:05.820 --> 22:09.300
And to be fair, NBA world, all world got the ax.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.080
Why did that game get the ax?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.080
It sucked.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
I'm sorry.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.920
Like, and I, again, I know people in Antigon, I'm sorry to be a bitch, but the reality is

22:17.920 --> 22:23.540
like, again, either, either invest in that statement that you've got or don't.

22:23.540 --> 22:31.380
And when you walk to your neighborhood park to play a mediocre single player cell phone

22:31.380 --> 22:38.100
basketball game for an arbitrary control of a basketball stadium that fits in with

22:38.100 --> 22:44.860
neither a fun game or your earlier mission statement.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.440
And there's the other extreme.

22:47.440 --> 22:52.340
And of course it's the pink elephant in the room, Niantic disabling remote, excuse me,

22:52.340 --> 22:58.020
not doubling remote raid passes, limiting them to five a day, consistently basically

22:58.020 --> 23:03.160
telling the Pokemon go fans, no, we're going to do what's best for the game.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.260
And do you know what are the most interesting comments I saw to that whole situation when

23:06.260 --> 23:15.120
Niantic literally and continues to in a defiant Reddit CEO kind of way continues to dig their

23:15.120 --> 23:20.160
heels in about nope, we're going back to the mission statement is that the comment I saw

23:20.160 --> 23:26.220
was I have never seen a company so beholden to their mission statement that they are willing

23:26.220 --> 23:29.980
to leave money on the table for it.

23:29.980 --> 23:34.140
Well then also on top of that, like as you mentioned a them walking back all the changes,

23:34.140 --> 23:38.680
one of the other things that they just did recently is they walked back the distance

23:38.680 --> 23:44.980
which you can capture Pokemon from 80 meters to 40 saying that it was an unintended effect

23:44.980 --> 23:45.980
and a bug.

23:45.980 --> 23:50.400
You know, this this great feature that you know, could be seen as, hey, you know what,

23:50.400 --> 23:54.200
we understand that there's people with mobility problems, and we want you to have fun.

23:54.200 --> 23:59.040
More like, oh, I'm sorry, we can't make as much money off you because you know, we want

23:59.040 --> 24:00.860
you to buy those incense and stuff.

24:00.860 --> 24:05.220
So well, now we're going to just drop it back down to see if that will get you to pay us

24:05.220 --> 24:06.920
more money for it.

24:06.920 --> 24:07.920
Yeah.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.320
Now, here's here's the thing and you'd probably like me to get to the fucking point already

24:12.320 --> 24:15.560
because I've been talking about this for a while but I wanted to set the stage for this

24:15.560 --> 24:22.200
and you know what, make make it very clear to you Niantic is torn between the AR thing

24:22.200 --> 24:28.680
and making the games that are fun and have the whole like, gameplay loop and all of that.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.920
Okay.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.920
Here's the thing.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.480
And yeah, yeah, Rob, it's easy to run a video game company.

24:33.480 --> 24:38.160
Why don't you try running one look, we've been following this industry for 21 years,

24:38.160 --> 24:40.280
I'm just going to offer my humble opinion.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.800
And I'm trying not to do it in a YouTube or podcast sensationalist way.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.200
I'm trying to do it in a realistic way.

24:46.200 --> 24:51.320
And my suggestion would be, you need to take the cue from epic games, you need to take

24:51.320 --> 24:56.480
the cue from some of these other Unity and Unreal.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.480
And here's what you need to do Niantic, you need to separate.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.660
And you need to do both.

25:02.660 --> 25:05.600
You need one company to handle the games.

25:05.600 --> 25:12.400
You need one company to handle lightship and AR and Wayfarer and that type of network.

25:12.400 --> 25:17.800
You need to split just as you split off of Google to achieve your vision.

25:17.800 --> 25:23.400
Because as you see, it is too difficult for one company and one CEO to do both.

25:23.400 --> 25:28.160
So in my opinion, that's what Niantic needs to do is they need to split meaning there

25:28.160 --> 25:33.500
needs to be a new CEO, a new top person in charge of the game with some game development

25:33.500 --> 25:37.720
background and experience, who hopefully can dig them out of you know, some of these holes

25:37.720 --> 25:44.560
and listen to because there's very clearly a conflict and you see this bolded underlined

25:44.560 --> 25:48.600
highlighted with what's happening with the Pokemon go and the consistent rollback of

25:48.600 --> 25:51.280
the changes.

25:51.280 --> 25:57.460
Every change they're rolling back in Pokemon go is in support of the other half of Niantic.

25:57.460 --> 26:04.320
And what Niantic believes is the future the AR dev lightship and taking Google street

26:04.320 --> 26:08.360
maps one step further.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.720
That's it.

26:09.720 --> 26:15.440
So Niantic can either go all in on that and Pokemon go will probably last a little while

26:15.440 --> 26:17.800
longer, but the steam is starting to run out.

26:17.800 --> 26:25.440
I have not opened poke Well, I opened it but like I have not played Pokemon go in a while.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.800
I think I uninstalled it a lot of people a long time ago.

26:30.800 --> 26:35.160
So I mean, it's first of all, I also think it's very boring.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.220
There's like, it's just repetitive over and over.

26:39.220 --> 26:43.540
But on top of that, I mean, with the way that they've been behaving, I haven't really had

26:43.540 --> 26:47.660
any desire to play any Niantic game.

26:47.660 --> 26:54.900
It's just I don't want to be and the thing is, is that they don't listen to their player

26:54.900 --> 27:01.020
base and do the things that are going to keep people engaged and keep, you know, I mean,

27:01.020 --> 27:03.380
there are people who like Yeah, I want my shinies.

27:03.380 --> 27:04.380
I want to do this.

27:04.380 --> 27:08.940
I like doing this one aspect of it or there's, you know, I'm not gonna

27:08.940 --> 27:12.540
say that there's not anything for anybody in the game.

27:12.540 --> 27:21.020
But from my perspective, me as a player, I, there was nothing to maintain engagement.

27:21.020 --> 27:26.280
Let's go to chat for some comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network as 100 Matt says

27:26.280 --> 27:27.940
Niantic is not a game company.

27:27.940 --> 27:31.220
And if someone goes to buy Niantic, they're not buying them for games.

27:31.220 --> 27:36.100
It will be for their AR geolocation tech will someone almost bought them for their games.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.940
I know we all saw that floating around the news.

27:37.940 --> 27:41.540
I know we have something coming up later in the show about, you know, Microsoft's potential

27:41.540 --> 27:45.540
acquisitions, but I don't think I'm spoiling things too much by saying Niantic in fact

27:45.540 --> 27:50.960
was on that radar, which kind of made me giggle because when the whole Pokemon go thing happened,

27:50.960 --> 27:55.420
I kind of joked and I said, Niantic needs to be bought out, although they're not going

27:55.420 --> 28:00.980
to be I had no idea Microsoft was actually exploring that opportunity, but ultimately

28:00.980 --> 28:06.920
decided to go a different direction with the Activision Blizzard decision.

28:06.920 --> 28:11.560
Let's see, Mike Deft in chat says, but yeah, it's baffling how Niantic is willing to be

28:11.560 --> 28:15.800
so fucking stubborn while the community wants them to change or at least adapt to the current

28:15.800 --> 28:24.000
world because Mike Deft it's in conflict with mapping the world and getting the AR data

28:24.000 --> 28:29.520
and getting the 3d scans of pokey stops because I'll tell you what, in Ingress, they finally

28:29.520 --> 28:34.560
incorporated this whole thing where the scanning of the locations you can now hack cubes in

28:34.560 --> 28:36.900
3d and this whole thing to get more gear.

28:36.900 --> 28:41.740
It's kind of messy in the way it works, but I guarantee they're trying to do something

28:41.740 --> 28:46.860
similar with Pokemon go and it will come in the next couple years where all those portal

28:46.860 --> 28:48.140
scans that sort of thing.

28:48.140 --> 28:52.100
They're going to try to get you out to those places to do, you know, an interact with the

28:52.100 --> 28:54.300
Pokemon for whatever kind of reward.

28:54.300 --> 28:58.160
I don't know what what they're going to dream up, but we'll see.

28:58.160 --> 29:04.860
Every step backwards that Niantic has taken and Pokemon go, they see it as a step forward

29:04.860 --> 29:08.520
for getting people back out there to collect the AR data.

29:08.520 --> 29:13.540
What they are not remembering is that people are not going to be motivated to go out and

29:13.540 --> 29:18.580
get the AR data if everybody else decided to say, screw it.

29:18.580 --> 29:21.980
And especially on a day like today where it's one hundred and eight degrees outside, you

29:21.980 --> 29:22.980
know what?

29:22.980 --> 29:23.980
Screw it.

29:23.980 --> 29:24.980
Did it?

29:24.980 --> 29:25.980
Did it?

29:25.980 --> 29:26.980
Let's see.

29:26.980 --> 29:31.620
I think there was one other comment I wanted to read here.

29:32.380 --> 29:37.460
S.H.O. 100 Matt says, and invest in a fucking PR and community management team.

29:37.460 --> 29:46.420
Here's the sad part, Matt, who do you think lost their jobs?

29:46.420 --> 29:50.420
But I'm going to guess those people all suck.

29:50.420 --> 29:59.740
In fact, I don't know how much I should say I'm very confident those individuals know

29:59.740 --> 30:04.620
damn well what everyone on the Internet is saying.

30:04.620 --> 30:10.220
Do you think maybe, as tends to happen in the gaming industry, there was someone up

30:10.220 --> 30:16.460
above them telling them, no, this is the message you need to run with the message?

30:16.460 --> 30:18.460
And what's the message?

30:18.460 --> 30:22.740
Get out there and go raid with your friends and make make friends from strangers and play

30:22.740 --> 30:29.060
in nature, because that is our mission statement.

30:29.100 --> 30:34.980
So it's not that they need a PR and community management team.

30:34.980 --> 30:35.980
They had one.

30:35.980 --> 30:37.420
They need it back.

30:37.420 --> 30:49.220
They need management, a mission statement, a corporate culture that supports that before

30:49.220 --> 30:50.300
anything else.

30:50.300 --> 30:57.220
And the only way that's going to happen at this point, as I said, is Niantic to split.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.820
Or hanky leaves and someone else comes in.

30:58.820 --> 30:59.820
But I don't see that happening.

30:59.820 --> 31:04.180
And again, it feels weird to me because I don't necessarily dislike John Hankey.

31:04.180 --> 31:05.580
I think he's very intelligent.

31:05.580 --> 31:08.060
I think he's contributed a lot to this.

31:08.060 --> 31:18.340
I think in this particular circumstance, he is running a company he doesn't want to run.

31:18.340 --> 31:20.020
And that's my final answer.

31:20.020 --> 31:22.300
All right.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.380
There's no other comments on that.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.020
Thank you all for indulging my TED talk.

31:25.020 --> 31:28.660
But you knew on this one, you knew on this one, I'd have something to say.

31:28.660 --> 31:29.660
All right.

31:29.660 --> 31:33.140
But let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things you want to say.

31:33.140 --> 31:35.620
So let's get into our gaming weeks.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.820
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

31:38.820 --> 31:40.500
It was all right.

31:40.500 --> 31:44.580
I, of course, played Dead by Daylight.

31:44.580 --> 31:48.300
I actually played some Killer by myself offline.

31:48.300 --> 31:56.420
And I'd been playing with Fixie and Shayla offline for the anniversary stuff earlier.

31:56.420 --> 32:01.580
And I'm liking the anniversary stuff, but matches have been weird because it's been

32:01.580 --> 32:08.580
either completely fun farming people and assholes.

32:08.580 --> 32:10.140
There's no in between.

32:10.140 --> 32:15.660
The sweat has been dripping off of killers and it is rancid.

32:15.660 --> 32:20.140
And then some smell like sweet petunias.

32:20.140 --> 32:29.140
But of course, I'm not super happy with all the cosmetics, but I'm a whore for the cosmetics.

32:29.140 --> 32:34.940
And then I have been, of course, on my wordscapes, talk about repetitive, but at least it's something

32:34.940 --> 32:37.980
that stimulates my brain.

32:37.980 --> 32:43.820
Also Midnight Suns, I'm getting a little bit, I mean, I love playing the game that's sort

32:43.820 --> 32:48.780
of like my mindless fun, but I don't know, maybe it's time to go back to the retro games.

32:48.780 --> 32:51.780
I haven't decided.

32:51.780 --> 33:03.460
And of course, Cult of the Lamb, I'm thinking about going back and playing into some of

33:03.460 --> 33:04.660
my backlog.

33:04.660 --> 33:13.020
And I actually also did download Unity for reasons.

33:13.020 --> 33:18.820
So we'll see what comes of that.

33:18.820 --> 33:23.540
But mostly it's just been my usual ones.

33:23.540 --> 33:30.180
Oh, we should be getting, I think we should be getting Reared Owl this month or next month.

33:30.180 --> 33:31.180
Something like that.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.180
Yeah.

33:32.180 --> 33:38.500
And I played something else and my brain is like, you can't think of anything else that

33:38.500 --> 33:39.860
you've ever played in your life.

33:39.860 --> 33:41.740
So I'm just going to leave it at that.

33:41.740 --> 33:42.740
Oh, yeah.

33:42.740 --> 33:43.740
Dig Dug.

33:43.740 --> 33:44.740
Fun.

33:44.740 --> 33:45.740
Yeah.

33:45.740 --> 33:46.740
All right.

33:46.740 --> 33:47.740
I'm going to go to you, Loki.

33:47.740 --> 33:52.500
But first, a lot of folks in chat have been taken by the game playing in your background

33:52.500 --> 33:56.540
tonight, which I believe I read about this somewhere on the internet, but it's like a

33:56.540 --> 33:58.940
newer version of ET.

33:58.940 --> 34:01.660
So you have video that runs behind you as we're taping live on Twitch.

34:01.660 --> 34:04.420
And this definitely looks like a sequel to ET.

34:04.420 --> 34:08.460
Tell us a little bit about this game you've got running behind you.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.900
I saw this in a tweet from Scott Rubin.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.220
You know, love Scott.

34:13.220 --> 34:17.740
It is an itch.io game called, but that's, you know, it's easy to understand.

34:17.740 --> 34:21.340
Yeah, it's called ET Returns.

34:21.340 --> 34:25.020
It's basically ET in the style of Vampire Survivor.

34:25.020 --> 34:30.140
So it's a shooter game that you have to survive hordes of enemies coming.

34:30.140 --> 34:32.660
They're all Atari 2600 enemies.

34:32.660 --> 34:37.960
So if, you know, we've got lots of different things in there, but yeah, it's free.

34:37.960 --> 34:38.960
You can check it out.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.960
I'll post the link here in chat.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.360
And yeah, it's pretty fun.

34:45.360 --> 34:50.800
So aside from that, I played, was it Proto Corgi this week, so I actually did play some

34:50.800 --> 34:51.800
things.

34:51.800 --> 34:52.800
That game is awesome.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.840
It really is.

34:53.840 --> 34:58.160
It's like under eight dollars right now on the Steam, and it's such a really good like

34:58.160 --> 35:03.700
classic side scrolling, shoot them up type of game.

35:03.700 --> 35:07.200
And it has a Corgi and it barks and it's super cute.

35:07.200 --> 35:11.040
It's done in like an anime style, like with the intro and everything.

35:11.040 --> 35:15.720
Highly, highly recommend you go check it out, especially in the Steam store.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.200
Yes, exactly.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.080
And it's just it's such a good game.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.080
It really is.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.600
The music, everything about the game is fantastic.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.800
And it's like under it's well under ten dollars right now.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.960
So like absolutely go pick it up.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.320
Aside from that, just Minecraft stuff.

35:30.320 --> 35:36.720
So working on my build right now, I'm almost I have it all designed.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.600
I'm actually building it and hoping to have an episode out this week.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.960
We figured out when our next season starting.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.240
So that's cool.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.240
And then.

35:46.240 --> 35:53.320
I don't know, I got very busy, thanks, like, you know, forever, but I'm very, very busy

35:53.320 --> 35:55.120
specifically in the next two months.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.120
So yeah.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.120
All right.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.120
That's it.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.120
Oh, oh.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.120
And I almost forgot.

36:00.120 --> 36:04.520
I also bought a a build your own pinball kit.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.480
And it's like a little tabletop pinball game.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.480
Yeah, that's pretty fun.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.440
It's all out of wood and stuff.

36:10.440 --> 36:15.080
There's a there's a guy who sells a couple of different things like that at some of the

36:15.080 --> 36:19.640
big expos, and I've been curious about the wooden one.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.640
Let me know if it's fun.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.480
Yeah, I'll have to see it.

36:22.480 --> 36:26.760
You know, as far as assembly goes, it's all like, you know, you put push everything together.

36:26.760 --> 36:31.360
I did kind of break one of the tiny little like pegs that you have to put into like adhere

36:31.360 --> 36:32.360
something to it.

36:32.360 --> 36:35.480
It's going to be like some hot glue being used, but you're supposed to be able to put

36:35.480 --> 36:38.120
it together without having to use hot glue.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.800
And it comes with like all the tools and everything for you.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.800
It.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.400
Yeah, not exactly the theme I would want.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.000
It's like circus themed and they have like circus music that plays over it.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.660
And so thankfully you can turn it off.

36:50.660 --> 36:53.660
But yeah, it has all the electronics and everything for it as well.

36:53.660 --> 36:56.960
So I'm very curious to see how it ends up playing.

36:56.960 --> 36:57.960
Cool.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.120
All right.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
Let's see.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.400
Let's go into a chat room over at Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network.

37:04.400 --> 37:08.560
Tiger class says he posted that first and then Scott posted it and credited him.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.560
Oh, sorry.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.560
I didn't see it.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.800
I mean, what?

37:11.800 --> 37:13.760
I didn't see a tweet on Twitter.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.240
I wonder why that is.

37:15.240 --> 37:21.680
It's not because that's a big dumpster fire and even more of a dumpster fire now with

37:21.680 --> 37:25.760
our, you know, rations of tweets per day.

37:25.760 --> 37:26.760
Thanks.

37:26.760 --> 37:27.760
I know.

37:27.760 --> 37:31.200
The advertiser supported what is that guy doing?

37:31.200 --> 37:32.240
He has no business.

37:32.240 --> 37:36.840
But when you have all that kind of money, like, but at this point, anyone willing to

37:36.840 --> 37:39.440
travel to Mars for that man is a fool.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.620
But I just like, I just like, well, like, yeah, yeah, like it's weird.

37:43.620 --> 37:49.440
Like the age that we're in right now, it honestly feels like the Internet is falling apart to

37:49.440 --> 37:50.440
a certain extent.

37:50.440 --> 37:54.920
Like, first you have the nonsense going on with Reddit, which sucks because I did use

37:54.920 --> 37:56.920
a third party app to view Reddit.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.960
And I've tried using their app to view it.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.960
It's awful.

37:59.960 --> 38:00.960
It's really bad.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.960
It's really.

38:01.960 --> 38:05.000
So, OK, I'll make this really quick.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.840
So Reddit basically is trying to do an IPO to do a dissertation like the one I provided

38:10.840 --> 38:11.840
earlier.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.440
But so we're going to try to try to make it very quick.

38:14.440 --> 38:19.660
They're trying to do an IPO so that they can make more money.

38:19.660 --> 38:25.840
And I guess so that's spaz the owner of Reddit or CEO or whatever can get out of the company.

38:25.840 --> 38:33.720
So they're trying to make it, you know, valuable for their shareholders, potential shareholders

38:33.720 --> 38:35.060
to invest in the company.

38:35.060 --> 38:40.580
So as that they wanted to stop third party apps because there's a potential that they

38:40.580 --> 38:45.020
could block ads and some of them may have blocked some of the ads or posts or whatever

38:45.020 --> 38:46.020
that they had.

38:46.020 --> 38:51.800
But that's not only what they did, though, they also provided like, you know, accessibility

38:51.800 --> 38:52.800
stuff.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.500
They made it a lot easier to view things.

38:54.500 --> 38:59.420
They were a lot more performant than Reddit stuff is because Reddit auto plays their official

38:59.420 --> 39:04.220
app, auto plays every single video that's on the page as you scroll by and it uses a

39:04.220 --> 39:08.700
ton more bandwidth than the other apps, which is annoying.

39:08.700 --> 39:09.860
So they did all that stuff.

39:09.860 --> 39:15.380
So the way they got they shut down the third party apps, as they said, instead of it being

39:15.380 --> 39:21.740
free to access stuff through the API, we're going to charge you X number of dollars per,

39:21.740 --> 39:24.820
you know, number of views per user or whatever.

39:24.820 --> 39:29.220
So it ended up being like, for example, I think Reddit is fun or Apollo one of those,

39:29.220 --> 39:35.340
I can't remember that they said it would cost them like $20 million a year to run that through

39:35.340 --> 39:37.980
Reddit, whereas they're not making that kind of money.

39:37.980 --> 39:44.980
So essentially, he each really made it really expensive for them to run these third party

39:44.980 --> 39:45.980
apps.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.700
So essentially shutting them down.

39:47.700 --> 39:51.400
Along with that, though, there's been protests, you had people blacking out like different

39:51.400 --> 39:53.280
subreddits in protest.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.000
So what he did is he took those mods and kicked them out.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.800
And he's now opening them back up.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.960
He's basically forcing this stuff open.

39:59.960 --> 40:03.880
But then there's other reds are protesting by like posting pictures of john Oliver, which

40:03.880 --> 40:04.880
is funny.

40:04.880 --> 40:05.880
I love that.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.760
So, you know, so they have that stuff.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.440
But it's just it's a big old mess.

40:09.440 --> 40:14.940
There's companies leaving like the Minecraft devs stop putting stuff on there now.

40:14.940 --> 40:18.640
So they've said bye, we're not doing we're not posting on Reddit anymore.

40:18.640 --> 40:23.680
So you have that they have GIF cat, which is another site that was used a lot with Reddit

40:23.680 --> 40:26.760
to post all the wonderful GIFs on there.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.300
They're shutting down September.

40:28.300 --> 40:32.000
So all of the stuff that's on there, all of that's gonna be gone all these broken links.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Awesome.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.720
And then you have Twitter doing Twitter things.

40:34.720 --> 40:39.800
So it's like, all these different platforms and social media and stuff are just like kinda

40:39.800 --> 40:42.840
say, Okay, well, where are we going next?

40:42.840 --> 40:46.600
Because like, same thing happened way back in the day with like digging stuff like everyone

40:47.560 --> 40:49.360
I was gonna say, I don't think the internet's dying.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.480
I think it's evolving.

40:50.480 --> 40:55.080
You know, and I understand that there's a bunch of websites used to be part of our daily

40:55.080 --> 40:56.920
and you just named one dig.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.440
Live Journal, of course, is what we've been talking about lately.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.440
You know, I met my husband on Live Journal, fuck, probably all of our relationships and

41:03.440 --> 41:08.240
OLR like was enhanced because of Live Journal and the deep, you know, relationships that

41:08.240 --> 41:11.160
you could really build on that website, but obviously, it's long gone.

41:11.160 --> 41:16.560
I mean, it's, it's there in name, but only in named, let's be real at this point.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.320
It, it really actually still functions exactly the same.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.320
It does.

41:21.320 --> 41:25.720
But, you know, number one, the fact that it's, you know, Russian owned in this, you know,

41:25.720 --> 41:31.520
global, you know, world, yes, it is an issue, fundamentally, it's the same app, people don't

41:31.520 --> 41:33.280
know what's going on behind it.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.280
Yeah.

41:34.280 --> 41:39.200
And a lot of, you know, people's tastes, you know, evolved to what was going on with, you

41:39.200 --> 41:44.040
know, Twitter, Live Journal, but then of course, where did face or excuse me, Twitter, my Facebook,

41:44.040 --> 41:47.600
but where did my space, you know, lead to Facebook and that type of stuff.

41:47.600 --> 41:52.560
And of course, my space then went under, you know, and, and there's, there's lots of websites

41:52.560 --> 41:54.560
that, you know, they come and go.

41:54.560 --> 41:58.520
And honestly, Twitter's, if you want to see what's going to happen to Twitter, look at

41:58.520 --> 42:01.940
Live Journal, functionally, it will still be the same.

42:01.940 --> 42:04.560
But by that point, everybody will have left.

42:04.560 --> 42:10.760
So except for maybe one random country that decides to embrace it, like it's, or the new

42:10.760 --> 42:13.640
owners decide to invest in that, you know, or whatever.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.640
So it's sure.

42:14.640 --> 42:15.640
Yeah, I know.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.640
It's not like the end of the world.

42:16.640 --> 42:17.640
It's just the inner.

42:17.640 --> 42:18.640
It's like some of the parts of the internet.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.960
It's just it makes it less convenient for things, I guess.

42:21.960 --> 42:26.480
It's not like, you know, it was, I don't remember too much with dig because that was a while

42:26.480 --> 42:27.480
ago.

42:27.480 --> 42:31.560
But it was pretty obvious like, okay, while going here, like, now it's like, what if I

42:31.560 --> 42:32.560
have a FARC?

42:32.560 --> 42:34.160
That was the website with the Photoshop contest.

42:34.160 --> 42:37.040
That was the one I don't think I've ever heard of that.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.040
Really?

42:38.040 --> 42:40.680
I think it was around the same time as dig.

42:40.680 --> 42:44.840
But yeah, I'm sure it'll all be fine like, you know, things will fall in place wherever

42:44.840 --> 42:45.840
they are.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.840
But like, I don't know.

42:46.840 --> 42:51.640
It's just, it's interesting that it's like all happening at one time like it's, I don't

42:51.640 --> 42:52.640
know.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.640
All right.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.640
Thank you.

42:54.640 --> 42:58.040
Thank gosh, someone else remembers that fifth dream in chat says I used to go there all

42:58.040 --> 42:59.040
day.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.040
All right.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.040
Anyway, moving on my gaming week.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.040
Sorry about my gaming week.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.040
Obviously, I don't have a ton to talk about because I've still been playing Final Fantasy

43:04.040 --> 43:05.920
16 all week.

43:05.920 --> 43:09.840
And yeah, pretty much everything I said last week hasn't really changed.

43:09.840 --> 43:10.840
Love the story.

43:10.840 --> 43:11.840
Love where it's going.

43:11.840 --> 43:17.080
Very interesting side quests, surprising amount of depth in the side quest.

43:17.080 --> 43:21.860
I was really there's a couple that really I was like, wow, this is this is some deep

43:21.860 --> 43:23.880
stuff in these side quests.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.240
So I was really impressed with that.

43:25.240 --> 43:31.000
But the only you know, again, kind of going back to you know, is it a perfect game new?

43:31.000 --> 43:34.960
There's some things where it's showing its weakness.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.840
I'm not sure it's a 10 out of 10 game.

43:36.840 --> 43:40.400
It's probably a nine out of 10 but but some things holding it back.

43:40.400 --> 43:45.420
Like, honestly, the shop and the crafting system feel like they're only there because

43:45.420 --> 43:47.320
they have to be.

43:47.320 --> 43:53.140
There's no real sense of choice in either of those systems or freedom or interesting

43:53.140 --> 43:55.720
things going on with that.

43:55.720 --> 43:59.280
So you know, that's that's my biggest thing where I'm like, why is this even here?

43:59.280 --> 44:02.240
This feels tacked on because like somebody would complain it's not a Final Fantasy game

44:02.240 --> 44:06.640
if it doesn't have shops and Gil and all that but like literally I'm hounding Gil with nothing

44:06.640 --> 44:10.200
to spend it on, which I find very interesting.

44:10.200 --> 44:14.140
But at the end of the day, it's more about the story, the gameplay, the experience and

44:14.140 --> 44:16.440
all of that has been really stellar.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.480
So that's my thought on that.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.680
But that isn't the only thing I've been playing this week.

44:20.680 --> 44:25.780
I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, honestly, because I've been trying

44:25.780 --> 44:29.320
to stream and or record all of my 16 gameplay.

44:29.320 --> 44:33.920
I have it all archived on my YouTube channel at this point, either my streams from Twitch,

44:33.920 --> 44:38.920
or side quest stuff that I just recorded, I didn't stream, it's all on my YouTube channel.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.320
But you know, sometimes I want to play something else.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.200
So I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight.

44:44.200 --> 44:49.380
But also, randomly, because it was on sale on the PlayStation Store, I forgot that this

44:49.380 --> 44:52.040
game had come out and I actually kind of wanted it.

44:52.040 --> 44:57.980
I bought today the Atari 50 collection, the 50th anniversary Atari that actually has a

44:57.980 --> 45:03.320
pretty good lineup of like 2600 games, arcade games, and yes, even Jaguar games.

45:03.320 --> 45:10.280
So you know, the first game I played several for a little bit was Tempest 2000.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.240
And I got my super zapper recharge.

45:12.240 --> 45:16.720
And I remembered how awesome that game was, because that game is fucking fabulous.

45:16.720 --> 45:20.560
So that was, yeah, that was a good good time.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.100
You know what I should do?

45:22.100 --> 45:28.760
I should send you like all of the the rips I made off of the Sega Saturn disk.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.240
Actually that might be it was all it was all Redbook.

45:31.240 --> 45:36.960
That might make for some fun, like raid and bit donation, you know, Twitch ambient noises.

45:36.960 --> 45:41.160
I bet super zapper recharge would be a fun one for something maybe a new follow or something.

45:41.160 --> 45:45.000
So I yeah, I it's great.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.560
Darja says the museum stuff is so in depth.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.560
It's wild.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.240
Yeah, I started to browse it a little bit.

45:50.240 --> 45:56.280
It is kind of like, it's like fucking Microsoft and Carta, but all about the Atari and on

45:56.280 --> 45:57.280
the PlayStation.

45:57.280 --> 46:00.320
It's like all of these things to read about.

46:00.320 --> 46:02.800
And I was reading, you know, obviously, it starts at the very beginning.

46:02.800 --> 46:05.160
So there was some stuff on computer space.

46:05.160 --> 46:09.200
And there's an interview in there where the guy, one of the target guys talks about that

46:09.200 --> 46:15.600
he tracked down just a few years ago, like 15 years ago, the very first computer space

46:15.600 --> 46:22.120
machine that was ever made, he was actually able to find it, you know, where he found

46:22.120 --> 46:28.400
it, Dixon, California, in a warehouse, really, it was it was sitting there and he talks about

46:28.400 --> 46:33.240
like, the yellow, like, because the guy apparently was selling them for like $5,000 each, and

46:33.240 --> 46:34.400
there were all these different colors.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.320
He's like, Where did he get these?

46:36.320 --> 46:39.980
And then he took a friend that I mean, it's all under the collection.

46:39.980 --> 46:46.300
And it goes, he goes, I realized this was like the Atari co founders actual collection.

46:46.300 --> 46:47.880
And this was computer space.

46:47.880 --> 46:51.040
The yellow one was the very first computer space machine.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.120
So he bought it and he has it for himself now.

46:53.120 --> 46:57.840
But I that cracked me up because he's sitting there going, Yeah, we found it in Dixon, California,

46:57.840 --> 47:01.520
which is a little, you know, pullaway town between San Francisco and Sacramento.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.480
I'm like, I know exactly where Dixon is.

47:03.480 --> 47:04.880
I've been there way too many times.

47:04.880 --> 47:05.880
Unfortunately,

47:05.880 --> 47:06.880
that's also where Pinagogo is.

47:06.880 --> 47:07.880
The pinball thing is.

47:07.880 --> 47:08.880
Yeah, I still do Pinagogo.

47:08.880 --> 47:09.880
Yeah.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.360
And I can't go because it's corn season.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.360
Yeah.

47:12.360 --> 47:13.360
So.

47:13.360 --> 47:20.240
But yeah, so it's interviews like that, you know, that, that make it very interesting.

47:20.240 --> 47:22.560
So they put it together like an interactive documentary.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.560
It's pretty cool.

47:23.560 --> 47:24.560
And of course, the games in there.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.960
I also played a little bit of the yards revenge reimagined.

47:27.960 --> 47:32.000
The only thing I don't like that's happening is that Atari is like going in like all these

47:32.000 --> 47:33.320
different directions.

47:33.320 --> 47:39.880
So they released like a yards revenge reimagined on steam recently.

47:39.880 --> 47:47.680
This is not that this is like literally the, you know, 4k cartridge from the 2600 but completely

47:47.680 --> 47:52.800
redone with like, like new graphics but in the style of old graphics.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.080
It's hard to explain.

47:54.120 --> 47:57.960
It looks really cool though like and I enjoy playing it because yards yards revenge to

47:57.960 --> 48:00.720
this day has solid fucking gameplay.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.000
It's a good game.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.260
So it was fun to go back and play it.

48:04.260 --> 48:07.160
So yeah, I think there's a lot of games in the collection.

48:07.160 --> 48:10.520
I think it's I think it's well done, you know, especially for whatever it cost me being on

48:10.520 --> 48:14.600
PlayStation Plus $27 or something like that was a really good deal and I bet this game

48:14.600 --> 48:18.440
will come down to $19.99 I'm sure at some point, I think that would be the sweet spot

48:18.440 --> 48:19.440
for a lot of people.

48:19.440 --> 48:23.320
So yeah, I think Atari 50 is worth checking out.

48:23.320 --> 48:26.000
If nothing else, go play those Jaguar games.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.360
None of them are very good except tempest 2000.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.520
But it's a it's a good trip down memory lane.

48:30.520 --> 48:33.760
And honestly, tempest 2000 is worth the price alone.

48:33.760 --> 48:37.880
Like it's tempest 2000 plus a lot of other cool games.

48:37.880 --> 48:40.480
So I'm doing something for you right now, Rob.

48:40.480 --> 48:43.600
Oh, just for the sake of our listeners.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.600
Okay.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.000
So give me a second.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
All right.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I'm making sure that you get this.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Okay.

48:50.480 --> 48:54.720
Because this is why everyone in the universe needs the soundtrack.

48:54.720 --> 48:57.520
All right, and I did it through discord.

48:57.520 --> 48:58.520
So you're welcome.

48:58.520 --> 49:05.280
Oh, um, I can't hold on because this is just I can't exactly bring up the discord easy.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.760
I thought that you were in.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.760
Nevermind.

49:07.760 --> 49:08.760
Don't worry about it.

49:08.760 --> 49:14.560
I actually have the the first big track apart from the intro for tempest 2000 in my collection.

49:14.560 --> 49:17.480
Okay, wait, hold on, because what I can do.

49:18.480 --> 49:24.080
Let me quickly do I didn't mean to completely derail things, but I figured people need to

49:24.080 --> 49:28.080
know Oh, girl, when don't you derail things on this program?

49:28.080 --> 49:29.080
Hey.

49:29.080 --> 49:30.080
Okay.

49:30.080 --> 49:31.080
Okay.

49:31.080 --> 49:34.880
So what we can do is we could have found you a Oh, there we go.

49:34.880 --> 49:38.520
Um, except Oh, shit, now I do this as classic game.

49:38.520 --> 49:39.880
Now I can't access discord.

49:39.880 --> 49:41.960
I have to do that real quick and drag it over here.

49:41.960 --> 49:42.960
Okay.

49:42.960 --> 49:43.960
I'm sorry.

49:43.960 --> 49:44.960
Okay.

49:44.960 --> 49:45.960
Okay.

49:45.960 --> 49:46.960
Okay.

49:47.440 --> 49:48.440
Yeah.

49:48.440 --> 49:49.440
Oh, yeah.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.600
Oh, this is really good quality.

49:51.600 --> 49:52.600
This is better quality.

49:52.600 --> 49:56.800
I think that's in the that's in the actual try 50 collection.

49:56.800 --> 50:00.000
So I know you guys can't hear it through discord but listeners can hear.

50:00.000 --> 50:08.040
This is the actual like 90s techno mortal combat.

50:08.040 --> 50:15.480
But this is this was 1996 97 around then maybe earlier than that, but I mean, this is what

50:15.480 --> 50:19.120
I was listening to in college when I wasn't listening to Radiohead.

50:19.120 --> 50:22.220
If I listen to this in the car, I'm going to pause this now and go back.

50:22.220 --> 50:26.240
If I listen to this car, I in the car, I would drive very fast.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.380
I would drive very, very fast if I had to listen to this for sure.

50:29.380 --> 50:31.000
So yeah.

50:31.000 --> 50:40.400
These were the ones that were ripped off the Saturn disk.

50:40.400 --> 50:43.360
Because the Saturn disk was all red book.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.360
Yeah.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.360
Yeah.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.360
All right.

50:46.360 --> 50:47.360
Tempest 2000.

50:47.360 --> 50:48.360
Fun game.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.360
All right.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.920
With that, let's get into some news.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.040
We have some headlines to tackle tonight.

50:53.040 --> 50:59.720
And of course, the ongoing courtroom saga that we've been talking about for months and

50:59.720 --> 51:04.560
months and years as the acquisition turns as the acquisition turns.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.480
What's the latest Loki?

51:06.480 --> 51:17.360
So Sony or Microsoft says it's Tony's fault that we have console exclusives because, yes,

51:17.360 --> 51:23.400
it says if it was up to me, I would love to get rid of entire exclusive or entire exclusives

51:23.400 --> 51:24.680
on consoles.

51:24.680 --> 51:30.640
But that's not for me to define as a low share player in the console market, Nadella said.

51:30.640 --> 51:35.740
The dominant player there, Sony, has defined the market competition using exclusives.

51:35.740 --> 51:37.440
So that's the world we live in.

51:37.440 --> 51:41.140
And I have no love for that world.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.140
I don't believe that.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.420
Wasn't Nintendo doing it first anyway?

51:44.420 --> 51:45.420
I don't know.

51:45.420 --> 51:47.540
But I also don't believe that.

51:47.540 --> 51:48.540
So you know.

51:48.540 --> 51:49.540
Yeah.

51:49.540 --> 51:56.840
I'm like the idea of exclusive goes back to honestly, the Atari and the Intellivision

51:56.840 --> 51:59.520
and all the systems that were out at that time.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.220
All these companies are making the combat was an Atari exclusive.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.220
They both do it.

52:03.220 --> 52:04.220
Yeah.

52:04.220 --> 52:05.220
They both do it.

52:05.220 --> 52:08.180
It's not just like because I think what was it?

52:08.180 --> 52:13.420
Tomb Raider was an exclusive on Xbox for a year as well.

52:13.420 --> 52:14.420
Second one was.

52:14.420 --> 52:15.420
Yeah.

52:15.420 --> 52:16.420
Yeah.

52:16.420 --> 52:17.420
Maybe the third one.

52:17.420 --> 52:18.420
One of them.

52:18.420 --> 52:19.420
One of them was.

52:19.420 --> 52:20.420
Yeah.

52:20.420 --> 52:21.420
Yeah.

52:21.420 --> 52:25.180
So it's like it's not just like a Sony thing.

52:25.180 --> 52:29.540
I don't know, like it's so dirty, like I just want this to be over with already.

52:29.540 --> 52:32.060
Like I'm so sick of it.

52:32.060 --> 52:38.020
It's just it's pathetic to hear these companies going, well, it's just not fair that you do

52:38.020 --> 52:39.020
it that way.

52:39.020 --> 52:41.900
And then I do this and it's just not fair.

52:41.900 --> 52:46.500
The world is not fair for us multi-billion dollar companies.

52:46.500 --> 52:52.340
I think another way to put it is incredibly transparent how the lawyers are twisting shit

52:52.340 --> 52:53.460
to get what they want.

52:53.460 --> 52:54.460
Of course.

52:54.460 --> 52:55.460
Of course.

52:55.460 --> 52:56.460
That's what it is.

52:56.460 --> 52:57.460
Yeah.

52:57.460 --> 52:58.460
They're going to make the argument.

52:58.460 --> 52:59.460
And I hope.

52:59.460 --> 53:01.460
Which is what our legal system is founded on.

53:01.460 --> 53:02.460
Yeah.

53:02.460 --> 53:03.460
Yeah.

53:03.460 --> 53:04.460
I hope.

53:04.460 --> 53:05.460
Who can argue that?

53:05.460 --> 53:06.460
However, you know, FTC.

53:06.460 --> 53:12.220
You know, I hope that our government is smart enough to see through that, but.

53:12.220 --> 53:13.220
Are they?

53:13.220 --> 53:14.220
Are they?

53:14.220 --> 53:15.220
Will they, though?

53:15.220 --> 53:18.780
They're like, well, they said that Sony does it, so I guess I have to believe that face

53:18.780 --> 53:19.780
value.

53:19.780 --> 53:20.780
Sure.

53:20.780 --> 53:21.780
I'll take the word for it.

53:21.780 --> 53:22.780
I trust everybody.

53:22.780 --> 53:23.780
100 percent.

53:23.780 --> 53:24.780
I'm sorry.

53:24.780 --> 53:27.220
I'm I'm I'm laughing.

53:27.220 --> 53:30.820
There's something else, too, that I referred I'd referred to earlier, like because Niantic

53:30.820 --> 53:31.820
was a part of this.

53:31.820 --> 53:32.820
Right.

53:32.820 --> 53:33.820
Yeah.

53:33.820 --> 53:37.640
So then there's also some emails that came out talking about different acquisition plans.

53:37.640 --> 53:42.240
So Microsoft, of course, in the buying mood of different companies, they had looked at

53:42.240 --> 53:47.780
purchasing other companies outside of Activision Blizzard before settling on them.

53:47.780 --> 53:55.540
So for example, some of those included Sega requiring Bungee Niantic, IO Interactive and

53:55.540 --> 54:02.660
Zynga to help bolster its Gains Pass service.

54:02.660 --> 54:08.660
They said that we believe that Sega has a well built or built a well-balanced portfolio

54:08.660 --> 54:13.940
of games across global segments and global geographic appeal, and that will help accelerate

54:13.940 --> 54:16.100
Game Pass both on and off console.

54:16.100 --> 54:18.520
All I'm saying is it's still not too late.

54:18.520 --> 54:21.140
You know, you could still purchase Sega as well.

54:21.140 --> 54:24.860
I mean, I don't know if this all falls through.

54:24.860 --> 54:28.100
And like, they're just going to go, OK, fine.

54:28.100 --> 54:32.340
You know, it's kind of like going on that like.

54:32.340 --> 54:37.940
Like retail therapy after a bad breakup or something like that, it's like, well, you

54:37.940 --> 54:41.740
know, I got to make up for retail therapy, but I guess I guess I'm just going to have

54:41.740 --> 54:48.540
to purchase some more companies then, you know, I mean, all those all those Microsoft

54:48.540 --> 54:51.020
buying Sega rumors came from somewhere.

54:51.020 --> 54:54.020
Microsoft may not have bought Sega, but they definitely deepened that relationship.

54:54.020 --> 54:56.380
I mean, hello, Phantasy Star Online, too.

54:56.380 --> 55:00.340
Like the whole reason we have that is because Microsoft kind of stepped in to make that

55:00.340 --> 55:01.340
happen.

55:01.340 --> 55:02.340
Right.

55:02.340 --> 55:03.560
So, you know, there's that.

55:03.560 --> 55:07.820
So yeah.

55:07.820 --> 55:12.500
It's interesting to see that some things did come of that whole situation.

55:12.500 --> 55:13.500
Right.

55:13.500 --> 55:17.540
So, yeah, I'm surprised they found value in Zynga, but I mean, you know, it's cool.

55:17.540 --> 55:18.540
Yeah.

55:18.540 --> 55:19.540
Somebody did.

55:19.540 --> 55:20.640
All right.

55:20.640 --> 55:25.000
Let's move on and talk about Blizzcon.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
Blizzcon's coming back.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.040
You know, we haven't had Blizzcon in a few years.

55:28.040 --> 55:33.920
You know, the pandemic happened and, you know, a lot has been happening with Activision Blizzard.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.960
I don't need to go back and talk about it.

55:35.960 --> 55:40.960
But obviously, they have not been in the public's favor as a result.

55:40.960 --> 55:45.360
But things are, you know, as we start to learn that that exists everywhere in the gaming

55:45.360 --> 55:49.000
industry and we sort of accept that, you know, at some point, Activision is going to get

55:49.000 --> 55:53.980
bought by somebody and Bobby Kotick is no longer going to be in charge, let's hope for

55:53.980 --> 55:54.980
God's sake.

55:54.980 --> 55:55.980
Someday.

55:55.980 --> 55:56.980
Hopefully.

55:56.980 --> 56:00.720
And that Blizzard has kind of had some wins on their hands lately, like Dragonfly, pretty

56:00.720 --> 56:04.200
good WoW expansion, better than the other recent ones.

56:04.200 --> 56:07.480
Diablo 4, really fucking good the way it turned out.

56:07.480 --> 56:10.960
So Blizzard has been kind of winning stuff lately and it's been winning back some of

56:10.960 --> 56:13.000
their fans as a result.

56:13.000 --> 56:21.000
So Blizzcon is going to happen and it will be priced at $300.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.600
If you would like to go to Blizzcon, you'll get access to all halls, the Blizzcon store

56:25.600 --> 56:30.080
on Thursday, you know, spending money to spend more money, Blizzcon in-game goodies and a

56:30.080 --> 56:31.080
Blizzcon backpack.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.080
Ooh.

56:32.080 --> 56:35.400
Well, you know what, if standing in line doesn't sound like fun to you, then you can get the

56:35.400 --> 56:38.480
Portal Pass, $800.

56:38.480 --> 56:44.080
Games you also access to an exclusive lounge, a separate registration line, a separate security

56:44.080 --> 56:48.040
line, and even early convention entry so you can go run and line up for whatever games

56:48.040 --> 56:52.040
you want to play because they're showing it, which I would imagine, I don't know what they're

56:52.040 --> 56:53.040
going to show.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.200
I feel like it'd be too early to unveil a Diablo expansion.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.040
Overwatch is in a weird place.

56:59.040 --> 57:03.560
Maybe the next WoW expansion, maybe something's brewing in the StarCraft universe.

57:03.560 --> 57:05.360
We haven't heard from that for a long time.

57:05.360 --> 57:06.360
That's true.

57:06.360 --> 57:10.280
It could be time to talk about StarCraft 3 or something in that universe.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.440
I don't know.

57:12.440 --> 57:18.120
But clearly Blizzard has something they want to show because I swear to God, if they charge

57:18.120 --> 57:25.400
people $300 just to do that year where don't you all have cell phones, it's over for Blizzcon

57:25.400 --> 57:26.840
to be quite honest.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.060
Is it though?

57:28.060 --> 57:30.060
Is it over?

57:30.060 --> 57:34.560
You know what, that's a fair point because most people go to Blizzcon to hang out with

57:34.560 --> 57:38.840
their WoW friends, or Overwatch Diablo friends, but mostly WoW.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.440
Some people just go to Discon.

57:41.440 --> 57:43.360
Which is, is that just Disneyland afterwards?

57:43.360 --> 57:45.520
That's when you go to Disneyland after Blizzcon.

57:45.520 --> 57:50.280
Or the hotel pre-, I went one year, yeah, because Alan and I went to Disneyland, and

57:50.280 --> 57:54.120
then we went to the pre-parties for Blizzcon and the post-parties, but we just went to

57:54.120 --> 58:00.600
Disneyland during the actual con, so there was that.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.640
Let's see.

58:02.640 --> 58:09.200
There also will be a virtual ticket, and it's gonna be free.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.200
Which is interesting.

58:10.200 --> 58:14.200
A virtual ticket is still an optional purchase, I think that gets you the stuff in-game if

58:14.200 --> 58:15.840
you do that.

58:15.840 --> 58:18.720
So that's kind of interesting, but you can watch the livestreams for free because it

58:18.720 --> 58:21.000
would be silly if you couldn't watch the livestreams.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.320
I have heard that there's some weird stuff going on though, where like they're not even

58:24.320 --> 58:27.280
doing the announcements in Hall D this year.

58:27.280 --> 58:33.400
They're doing it in the arena, which means the arena can only hold so many people, and

58:33.400 --> 58:36.080
the rest of the convention center's gonna be for overflow.

58:36.080 --> 58:40.960
So even if you buy a $300 ticket, you may not get to go to the opening ceremonies live.

58:40.960 --> 58:46.440
There's just some weird shit going on with this year's Blizzcon, and I don't know.

58:46.440 --> 58:51.240
But people will have to make up their mind, because tickets go on sale July 8th at 10

58:51.240 --> 58:55.080
AM, the first wave, and the second wave July 22nd at 10 AM.

58:55.080 --> 58:59.960
Blizzcon, by the way, is in Anaheim from November 3rd through the 4th.

58:59.960 --> 59:04.760
I mean, I don't know.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.240
What's going on over here?

59:06.240 --> 59:10.560
Sorry, suddenly a full screen ad started playing.

59:10.560 --> 59:11.560
Sorry about that.

59:11.560 --> 59:14.640
Oh, the Tempest video was still running, and then it ran an ad in the middle of it.

59:14.640 --> 59:16.720
My bad.

59:16.720 --> 59:23.360
But anyway, yeah, I'm curious to see what they're gonna announce to justify that cost.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.400
Maybe a new IP or something up their sleeve.

59:25.400 --> 59:28.320
Oh, Hearthstone has been quiet for a little while.

59:28.320 --> 59:29.320
That's a good point, Fifth Dream.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.920
I don't know if we've seen anything out of Hearthstone for a while.

59:31.920 --> 59:33.920
We'll see.

59:33.920 --> 59:34.920
All right.

59:34.920 --> 59:36.480
I think Dark Soccer, I heard you back, yeah?

59:36.480 --> 59:37.720
Yeah, I'm back.

59:37.720 --> 59:38.720
Okay.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.400
Your camera stopped for whatever reason.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.400
But what is on?

59:41.400 --> 59:43.360
Oh, because I didn't turn it back on.

59:43.360 --> 59:44.360
There you go.

59:44.360 --> 59:45.360
All right.

59:45.360 --> 59:47.360
What's next for you?

59:47.360 --> 59:54.560
So a game that I love, that I actually kind of miss playing with certain people, Among

59:54.560 --> 59:55.600
Us.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.080
We love Among Us, don't we?

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.920
Well, it's getting an animated series.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:08.960
They are working with, actually, hold on, let me just go ahead and, yeah, IndieSloth

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:20.240
is working with CBSi animation to make this a reality.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.280
It definitely, I think, is about time.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:30.040
I mean, because it was, it's one of those games that came up and rose really sharply

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:36.720
and then it had this really quick decline and then came back up.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:44.600
And so I'm hoping it has the same sort of weird humor that the game keeps as well.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.880
I want something a little bit more adult and subversive than just for kids.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.480
But I think this is going to be a lot of fun.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.480
I'm looking forward to it.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:04.280
So just as long as there's spikes going through people's heads and random gunshots and people

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.920
being set on fire, I'm happy with that.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.280
Sounds like a lovely kid's show.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.080
I wonder if even there might be like a spy versus spy element to it.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080
I think.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.080
Oh, I could see that.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.080
I could see that.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.080
Yeah.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.520
As Stuart Hunter Matt says, so glad Owen Dennis working on this, he did a great job on Infinity

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520
Train.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.520
Yeah.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.120
Yeah, it'd be cute.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.120
So we'll see.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.120
We'll see what comes of that.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.600
I wouldn't mind if it was kind of like a dark humor type of thing, you know, where it can

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.840
still be like kid appropriate, but it's a little bit morbid, like like the Addams Family.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.680
It's kind of like that, you know.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.720
I would I would argue that.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.720
Well, I don't know.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.760
Yeah, I see it.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.680
Maybe I'm just thinking the Addams Family today, because today I was randomly thinking

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.560
of Debbie Jelinski from Addams Family values and how Joan Cusack is the is the the most

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.600
perfect supporting actress ever in a motion picture in that role.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.120
Debbie Jelinski is the best supporting actress ever in a motion picture, period.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.520
Did you did you see like my posts on and well, I know that you're not doing the Twitter thing

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.280
so much anymore, but I actually wanted to I'd get cut off.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.600
Don't I deserve love and jewelry?

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.480
Did you ever watch Wednesday?

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.520
I need to.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.800
I saw a couple episodes in the background at a friend's house, but I have it and it

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.440
was the dance episode to the one that Yeah.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.760
But I haven't watched it start to finish.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.760
I need to.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.760
But it was pretty good.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.760
I liked it.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.760
You look cute.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.520
It was it was like kind of I don't know.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.520
It was it was pretty good.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.660
I don't know.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:46.400
It felt like a Harry Potter TV series, but not without the without the transphobia.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.400
Yeah, it's great.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.840
Yes, exactly.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:57.920
As we were saying, I was going to say and then I also said, so I have to use persuasion

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:04.800
and slides as my two favorite lines, as Joe and Matt says, Infinity Train had a ton of

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.280
dark humor, a very deep mystery that was kid appropriate.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280
OK, sounds interesting.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280
Could be interesting.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280
All right.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.640
I want something like Rocky and Bullwinkle way where kids can watch it and laugh.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.280
And then when you go back as an adult who actually knows the history of the era.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.040
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.520
Tiny toons and Animaniacs were very Animaniacs.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520
Yeah.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520
Yeah.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520
And Freakazoid.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.620
That's a great humor, for sure.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.660
That takes talent in writing to get that to go off.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.120
And such such a missed opportunity Warner Brothers for not making a live action Freakazoid

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.400
movie with Jim Carrey like probably 20 years ago.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.400
Amazing.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.400
All right.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:48.920
Well, speaking of things that have had to pivot pretty quick, Loki.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
Yes.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:59.720
So Daedalic put out a game, maybe, maybe you can classify it as a game, Lord of the Rings

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.060
Golem.

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.240
It was awful.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.600
It was absolutely all around awful.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.360
And originally the studio was poised to make.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.640
Golem as a character is not good, too.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.760
I'm going to go.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.000
Let's start there.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Let's start that like the most annoying part of those movies.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.440
Golem is a means to an end in the books and in general.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.680
The most annoying things in that movie who said let's put them in a starring role in

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.680
the game.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.680
First mistake.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:32.280
Yeah, it was bad corrupted hobbit who kills people as you're, you know, well, on top of

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.240
that game out of Liv Tyler, she's pretty it the game itself was really awful in the sense

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.960
that even with the Golem character, it was just you're in jail for a while and you're

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.840
doing jail things and it's stupid.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:51.920
And that's beyond like if you don't even look at the technical parts of the game, which

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.720
it was just awful all around awful gameplay, awful everything.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:02.280
The game lagged out people's PCs while displaying the credits at the end of the game.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.400
That's how bad it is.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.400
It's so bad.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.160
OK, anyways, so the studio, of course, apologized for the state that Golem was in.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.600
Then, of course, they kind of put out this statement saying even though Lord of the Rings

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.280
Golem did not live up to expectations we had for the game.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.360
Yeah, like by a mile.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:29.480
We are very grateful for this opportunity and learning experience it brought us.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:36.040
It's a difficult break, but also a new beginning in the long history of Daedalic entertainment.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.160
We value each and every one of them.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:44.800
Anyways, basically somebody I'm assuming the Embracer group said, Hey, you're making more

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.400
games for this because like originally they were going to make like, I think, eight different

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.720
Lord of the Rings games.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:55.040
Yeah, you're touching any more of this property.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:02.200
So because of they also said that they twenty five of it, like at this point, they're not

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.440
even going to be allowed to adapt the book.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.000
Everybody poops like that.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.440
That's just this game company is done.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.400
The only thing that pooped was the game.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.840
It was just it was.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.840
No, the game.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:18.840
The game was the gas we pass the less talked about sequel.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.120
They were written by different authors, so just part of a series.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.880
And I think I have most of them.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:31.420
I actually do have the gas we pass and everyone poops and a couple of the others.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.820
And I still consider Go the Fuck to Sleep a part of that that trilogy, even though it

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.900
isn't actually related, it is my head canon.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.780
I think there's like six books in the series.

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:50.500
You know, if there's anything that we learn from this game, it's you don't preorder games.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:56.100
That's what can be learned from this game because you don't preorder games that you

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.220
don't know.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:01.540
That you don't trust the reputation of the of the publisher.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:07.840
Yes, but to that effect, if we were going to go with that logic, then we get cyberpunk

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.900
and you know, we know what happened with cyberpunk.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:17.620
So it's I think it's you wait for the reviews to come out because you don't really necessarily

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:21.980
need those preorder bonuses because a lot of times it's just nonsense.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:29.380
Oh, by the way, they also tried to sell DLC with this, one of which added elvish language

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:33.980
to the game, which elves are in the game for such a small period of time.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.100
It's like almost insignificant altogether.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:42.200
And they added like some moat for Gollum to like swat at flies in a game of single player.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.260
Why do you need a moat at all?

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.660
What's the point of that?

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.660
Yes.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.660
Disgusting.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.660
Bad all around.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.900
Like a disgusting.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:50.900
It's awful.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.900
Yeah.

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:58.140
Ah, um, TigerClawn chat raises a good point worth bringing up.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:02.740
It's unfortunate because even developers make bad games but managed to come back when they

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.020
made a good one.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.860
I mean, it is a fair point.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.940
We've seen developers that make bad games, but they come around and they make a good

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:10.940
one.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:15.100
You know, just because you make one bad game doesn't mean you're gonna make bad games forever.

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.920
Case in point, you've got ET playing behind you there.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.780
Howard Scott Warshaw, who made ET made some of the greatest Atari 2600 games around.

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:25.300
We know, you know, if you do your history, you know, you know that, you know, there were

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:30.140
other circumstances at play with ET, such as deadlines and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.540
Y'all know where I'm going with this.

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:37.820
So is a publisher that makes a bad game doomed to always make a bad game?

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:42.060
So I mean, even though we're looking at this going, haha, the Gollum developers, that game

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.120
was so bad, we knew this is gonna happen.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.660
No one's like saying, wishing for the game to be bad.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:49.940
It's just, it was bad.

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:53.740
I think it was even a delayed game that they deleted to make it better.

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.580
But it was like, like, how does that even ship?

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:58.580
Like who?

01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.580
Yeah.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:00.580
Who?

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.580
Who signed off on that?

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.580
That's what it is.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:05.900
Who came up with those micro transaction things that are ridiculous?

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900
Yeah.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.020
Well, they signed off on releasing the game like that.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.860
Like that's, that's, that's what needs to happen.

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.860
Yeah.

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:16.500
Micro transactions aside, like you could just play the game and see like, oh, this is not

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500
ready to go.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.780
Like, and I get it.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:22.420
There's some, some of it might be, well, we're going to get backlash.

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.380
Well, we as maybe not the publisher, the publisher is probably not getting backlash.

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.940
Everyone's looking at the developer.

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.660
This developer didn't publish this game.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.020
A publisher did.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:35.140
And the publisher is the one responsible for saying, yeah, that's good to go to market.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:38.580
So like, why aren't we getting mad at, I assume it's the eraser group.

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.460
I think that has the studio, like, why are we getting mad at them?

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.620
Like because they signed off on it.

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:44.620
Problems right now.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.740
They don't need this on top of that, which, well, they do add this on top of that, unfortunately.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:55.660
Well, manage your developers better than maybe, you know, you know, if you saw this obviously

01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:01.940
was in bad shape for a very long time, it didn't just suddenly happen like, sorry.

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:04.620
It probably should have been canceled years ago.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.620
Yeah.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:09.780
You know, when it hit one of its benchmarks, somebody should have seen that this was terrible.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:13.300
So missed, missed it on that.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:17.180
And then on top of that, like, as you mentioned, like, even at the very best, it's a golem

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.180
game.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.980
Like, yeah, exactly.

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:24.620
Take the worst character in Lord of the Rings and make the movies anyway, and make, make

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.860
a video game out of them.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:27.860
Really?

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.860
Whose idea was that?

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:29.860
All right.

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.860
Moving on.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.060
Let's talk about Nintendo.

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:36.140
Somebody that somebody that could get away with putting a bad game out there is actually

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.620
you want to talk about a studios that have made bad games occasionally, but then come

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.700
around and make really, really, really good ones like Tears of the Kingdom or what have

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.620
you, you know, plenty of good games from Nintendo.

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.260
Nintendo is thinking about their next console.

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.260
Of course they are.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.020
They've been thinking about it for some time.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.340
And they actually said in a shareholder meeting that because they were asked if your Nintendo

01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.140
Switch purchases would carry over to future game consoles.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:05.320
So the CEO and President Shintaro Furukawa said in the transition from Nintendo Switch

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.300
to the next generation console, we would like to make every effort to ensure that customers

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:12.820
can make the transition smoothly while using their Nintendo account.

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:18.620
So it seems to imply that Nintendo Switch titles purchased in the eShop will carry over

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.740
to what comes next.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:24.140
But we don't know that for sure, but at least your account will move over because now you

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:29.260
have that central Nintendo account and you don't have to make like a console specific

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:33.220
account like you did on like 3DS, Wii U and everything else before that.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.780
Everything is now on that Nintendo account.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.780
I'm going to call it right now.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.780
I'm going to say it right now.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:44.740
100% I guarantee 100% this system will not be backwards compatible with the Switch.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.740
100%.

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:49.340
The only thing that will come over is your Nintendo Switch, your Nintendo online account,

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.820
just like it did from the 3DS to the Switch.

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.820
100% guarantee it will never be backwards compatible with those games.

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:56.820
Why?

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:57.820
Because they don't know how to do it.

01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:02.220
And also because the Switch is so old anyways that they just won't be able to do some sort

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.820
of compatibility, even though like the Steam Deck can run it.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:11.220
I mean, certainly another console could probably pull off emulation for that, but for whatever

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.380
reason they won't do it.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.540
It will not be backwards compatible.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:19.140
I'm not so fast to put my head, hedge my bets on that.

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.620
I, you know, I'm looking at a DS 3DS kind of situation.

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:28.780
I think Nintendo knows they have a winner with the Switch and I don't think they're

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:32.620
going to be quick to repeat the mistakes of the Wii U and radically shake up the formula

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:36.020
that's working for them, at least not for this next console.

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:40.260
I do think the next console Nintendo puts out is basically going to be a Super Switch.

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.260
I could be wrong.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.540
I think I think the Super Switch or whatever, and this is for lack of a better name, it

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:51.860
will have some quirky new mechanic that separates it a little bit, maybe like a camera built

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:52.860
in.

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.660
I don't know why my brain does that again.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.820
I don't know why my camera, I don't know why my brain wants to go to the VR AR space.

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:03.140
I feel like it's a thing like Nintendo's like, I don't know, but we'll see.

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:10.860
But I think it will be some sort of Switch, but with a little something extra.

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:18.340
Well, I had already put out there once that it would be Switch 3D or Switch 3, meaning

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:25.660
it would switch to handheld television and virtual reality.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:31.820
I know it's a long shot, but I feel like that would be the thing that Nintendo could

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:35.500
do to make the new Switch quirky would be to say it does VR.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.900
We'll see though.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:40.460
But I think whatever it is, it will support the old games.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.340
But if they do something radically different and come up with a complete different type

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.520
of console, then yeah, I'm with you, Loki.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.980
But I think just fundamentally, I don't think they deviate from the Switch that much.

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:51.900
They're going back to cartridge.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.900
Going back to cartridges.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:55.380
Well, they're using cartridges now in a sense.

01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.100
So I mean, yeah, that's true.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.980
Yeah, go back to this.

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:02.380
Yeah, go back to disks.

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:02.880
There you go.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.820
Now you got it.

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:10.820
All right, let's move on Dark Sakura.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.820
I put myself down a rabbit hole.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.420
I'm sorry.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:16.620
Anyway, good news coming up.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:22.220
So and I actually got into this a little bit with the coworker the other day.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.980
Steam, well, actually, I'll go back.

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:35.220
There's a Reddit post that is hinting that Valve may be banning games made with AI art.

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:45.260
It was basically noticed by the founder of Game Discover Co.

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:51.100
Simon Carlos said that there was a message from Valve

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:56.980
saying it cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all the necessary rights.

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:04.300
And another person wrote that Steam denied their game for utilizing AI tech.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:13.140
And both of them had in common that some of their assets were AI generated.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:23.740
So, yeah, they're very quietly banning the games that include AI created art assets.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:29.540
Basically, if you can't prove that you own the right for the assets that trained those algorithms,

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.540
you can't have the thing in there.

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:36.100
No, no, no, no, that's not true for Steam.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:43.020
You will, it's not necessarily that they can ban you if you admit it.

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:50.580
It's if you can't provide the proof, not necessarily an admission.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:16:01.300
But at any rate, the rules themselves don't say anything about banning like AI made content,

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:05.780
as opposed to how they do like blockchain stuff.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:11.740
But some of these ones have very obviously used AI generated art.

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:21.860
And, I mean, basically, any of us who are artists, you know, or who do graphic design,

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:32.100
or do, I mean, in general, it basically infringes on our potential ability to do this as a living,

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:40.220
you know, if someone can go to an AI generator and say, I need a logo that does this stuff.

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:46.180
What's to say they're not going to get that free logo with their, you know, mid journey account, right?

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.100
I now I will say that I have played with it.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:54.220
And it was hilarious because I came up with Ballerina with three legs.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:17:05.140
But I do not support the use of this for the purpose of making a game that you intend to make money on.

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:09.660
If you need art assets, you hire a fucking artist. End of story.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:18.220
Or you pay for the art that has been submitted to, you know, stock accounts, you know, it's, it's,

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:23.420
well, and on top of that, I will say going back to what Ron Shawn said about artwork with a character with six fingers.

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:28.980
I mean, we did have the Princess Bride with the man with six fingers on his left hand, just saying.

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:32.420
That and Julian had an extra thumb when he was born.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:38.140
But anyway, but Valve was basically putting out,

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:46.620
and this is a quote on here, unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has a sufficient rights to the training data.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:51.820
And that it's also been denying games with AI made text.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:57.740
So, so there's some people were talking about it being a hoax.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:03.340
But honestly enough, though, it does bring up.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:14.140
That. That basically it's something that needs to be a point of discussion.

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.260
Yeah, this is coming on top of that.

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:25.020
Yeah, if you are using a third party algorithm.

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:32.380
To generate artwork that you did not make instead of paying somebody.

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.980
Who does this for a living.

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.220
Then.

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:43.580
Yeah, and I went to a comment from in chat from fifth dream saying check my Twitter for my AI art.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.420
Please tell me where I'm a bad person.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:48.780
You're not because you're not trying to pass it off and sell it to somebody else.

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.220
That's the difference between what's going on here was you're not trying to pass it off as your own art.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.620
So somebody else that's the difference should be very transparent.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.940
I'm fucking around with AI art as dark soccer.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.980
Just said she did too.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:18:59.740
So I played with it.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:18:59.980
Fuck it.

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:00.380
I did.

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:06.220
You know, I sent really funny examples to people and I certainly don't have a problem with.

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.420
Generating it as like an art reference for yourself.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:19.020
Yeah, number one, you know, I if I can't find a body reference for something that I'm very specifically trying to draw.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:24.460
Then yeah, I mean using using that as a reference for your own work.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.980
Is one thing, but passing this off as something that you did.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:40.780
No, passing it off as content for a game that you do not pay for this content and do not have rights to it or the material that supplied it.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.580
The same, it's not yours.

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:44.540
Here's the thing.

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.340
It's a cult.

01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:50.220
It's, it's, it's an amalgamation of other people's work.

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.980
So here's the thing.

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.340
So here's the thing.

01:19:53.340 --> 01:20:00.700
I think AI is going to be here in this industry as the concept of machine learning.

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:05.020
You know, cause that's, that's basically, you know, we, we keep calling it AI, but it's based on machine learning.

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:08.780
And I think for me, the big question is how did the machine learn?

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:17.340
Because I think machine learning as a development concept is going to stay here in this industry and it's how the graphics are going to get better.

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:24.460
And how we're going to respond to the 8k and whatever else, 120 frames a second, whatever else becomes, it comes beyond that.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:28.140
We all know, as it is today, games take a long time to develop.

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:31.900
And I think machine learning is going to probably accelerate that process.

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:35.580
But again, it comes back to the question of how did the machine learn?

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:47.260
If the studio developed the machine learning based off their own stuff, their own assets, their own thing to, you know, help them in a, which, which honestly, when it comes to level design, things like that, a lot of studios are already doing.

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.460
Then fine.

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:53.820
They built the technology they're teaching, they're teaching themselves how to do a better bed box.

01:20:53.820 --> 01:21:07.980
But if the machine learning is coming from Reddit, the internet, things that artists who work for money and stuff put out there that then the machine learns from that's where artists are getting pissed off.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.820
They don't want the machines learning from them.

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:15.660
And I need to actually define, because clearly people don't seem to actually know what machine learning is.

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.300
Machine learning starts with a database.

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.660
The machine doesn't know anything.

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:25.100
It is completely void and empty.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:35.820
What you do is you put in existing information that the machine learns from things that it takes from these other sources.

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.060
It is not its own information.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:47.020
It will try to extrapolate what it has from the information that was provided to it as a source.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.100
It is not a human brain.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.100
It does not have talent.

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.380
It does not have education behind it.

01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:59.900
It is simply a query for a database with some more complex programming.

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:04.140
Fan art, since you bring it up, has zero to do with this.

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:10.860
Nor does fan writing because you can, number one, like Marissa just said, you cannot distribute them as your property.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.780
They are considered works of transformative media.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:20.940
Meaning that, first of all, they are under copyright protection no matter what Anne Rice has to say about it.

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.980
You cannot make money off of them.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:34.220
It is put under free use and it does not use the thoughts and actions that come from other people.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:40.060
You are not copying and pasting out of other people's writing directly from a book.

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:43.100
You are creating this scenario from your own mind.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.300
That is a different thing.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:52.460
If you put out, say, computer, use this data to write this fanfic, then that is a different story altogether.

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:59.980
You are completely, you do not understand what you are talking about, Fifth Dream, end of story.

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.700
End of story, you do not understand what you are talking about.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.820
I think that is a little harsh.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.420
Everybody is welcome to their perspective.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:14.140
But opinions based on a lack of knowledge are not valid.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.340
But Fifth Dream says, explain fan art boost at cons.

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:24.940
And I would say that when it comes to the fan art boost at cons, that thing has been a ticking time bomb for a long time.

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:28.380
But that is not the same as stealing someone's art.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.580
No, it is not.

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:32.060
This is art in someone's own personal style.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:40.460
But I am also pointing out, what I am trying to point out is that because that exists does not mean it is like completely, I am like, that is a ticking time bomb.

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:44.940
There is going to come a day when Nintendo or somebody, the problem is,

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.300
no, well, it is not really a problem.

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.780
Because again, I do not think they are a problem.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:53.900
But what is going to happen someday, nobody wants to be the first company to do it.

01:23:53.900 --> 01:24:00.220
But someday, there is going to be a company, Nintendo, that tries to shut that down.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:05.740
And in the end, false equivalence like you are bringing up is a fallacious argument.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.420
It does not qualify as an argument.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:11.500
All right, I would say let us move on to something else for time.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.260
Unfortunately, we have another AI story.

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:14.220
So let us get to it.

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:22.540
Yes, this is going to make it a little bit difficult with the whole not allowing AI art on Steam.

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:29.820
Because Unity is officially embracing AI with a couple new enhancements to Unity.

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.860
So they have now Unity Muse and Unity Centris.

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:40.220
So Unity Muse is a platform of AI capabilities for content creation.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:47.420
They said with Muse chat for AI based search now in closed beta and AI powered experiences

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:51.180
at Unity runtime is also now in closed beta.

01:24:53.820 --> 01:25:03.660
So based off of like their little sizzle reel that they had, it is generating like images as well.

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:09.420
So from what is a good question, since it has Muse in the title, I assume it is from Muse.

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:14.860
But yeah, Centris, I am not really sure what exactly that is either.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.420
I know some of the complaints I have seen before with some of these is that like, for example,

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.780
you are saying generate this.

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:26.060
It is just pulling down assets like 3D models from the web for different things,

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.420
which is kind of annoying.

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:32.940
But you know, with that, of course, developers are very wary about what Unity is doing right now

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:38.380
and saying, you know, hey, you know, just to jump on the train, what data set y'all pulling the art

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:44.300
from? Unity fully needs to be transparent about what machine learning models will be implemented

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:47.180
during including the data that they have been trained on.

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.460
How the machine is learning.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.500
There it is.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.900
Yeah, I didn't even know that that was that was what was coming.

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:52.400
That's perfect.

01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:53.980
Yeah, I don't need this.

01:25:53.980 --> 01:26:00.060
I don't see any way machine learning in current iterations can be effective without training

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.940
on countless ill gotten data.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.580
Really concerning image generation stuff.

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:06.780
What data sets?

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.940
Hi, what data sets was this train on?

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.700
You get the idea like this is the type of stuff that, you know, they're obviously concerned with

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:18.700
because as they should be, because imagine you're a developer and you're you decide to utilize this

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:24.140
in your game, you publish your game, all of a sudden you're getting a copyright claim because

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:30.460
some of the artwork that was in there was not acquired by Unity in a proper way.

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:36.940
Oh, now you have to pull your game off of, you know, steam because or you're in legal

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:42.540
trouble because, oh, yeah, it stole from this artwork to make this thing.

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:45.660
So that kind of sucks.

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:51.980
Where I would say that this is kind of what I could be useful for is, for example, if

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:57.260
I'm trying to implement something and it's just racking my brain how to code something

01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:03.100
in a certain way, yes, AI would be nice to be able to like, say, hey, I want to write

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:09.420
a function that does this and then have it like spit out something for me and then I

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:15.180
could try plugging in and see if that works and or like, hey, can you write a better?

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:20.140
Can you take this code that I wrote and make it more performant or something like that?

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:24.380
Like, that's where I think this would be useful when it comes to AI generating art.

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.780
Yeah, like, I don't know.

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.860
They showed an example like animations like make this character do a backflip.

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.700
OK, but where is it getting that animation information from?

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:39.580
Unless it's they're doing like their own training and stuff on their own sets of material and

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.060
their own like capturing and stuff like that.

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.580
I just don't see that happening.

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:47.500
I see them cobbling this together in the cheapest way possible.

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:49.660
I can say this.

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:54.700
And I think fifth dream is finally starting to get the point with what he just said.

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.020
You trained it with your own image.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:57.820
That's one thing.

01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:58.540
That's your art.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.180
Now, the thing is, is that I work in tech.

01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.380
I can't say where I work.

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:09.580
But when like and like what you were just saying, Loki, with the material being used

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:13.260
to fit is provide if it's being taken without consent.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:18.700
Well, what happens if someone walks into your house and runs off with your PlayStation without

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.060
your consent?

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.580
It's called stealing, right?

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:23.820
It's.

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:32.940
If it's with your own material or in the public domain, one thing, if it's taking from something

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:37.500
that other people have put their hard work into, for example, creating those animations

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.900
for their own games from scratch and another company is using them to build their machine

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.820
learning tool, that is stealing.

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:48.860
Let me try my very best to put this another way, and then I really want to move on because

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:49.980
we still have a lot of show to do.

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:53.420
I'm going to try my very best to explain this a different way, and I'm going to use this

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.540
show as an example.

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.420
So here's to me, here's the difference.

01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:00.300
OK, there's a lot of OLR out there.

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:03.100
There's 966 episodes of OLR.

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:10.060
Hypothetically, somebody could feed all 966 episodes of the show into some one of these

01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:16.380
little things, and they would be able to develop their own Orange Lounge Radio as a result,

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:23.340
because they could feed all of this show into a database or, you know, an AI thing, train

01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:27.340
it the types of things we say, how we say them, how we respond to things.

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:33.100
Somebody could take this show, put it in one of these and churn out their own Orange Lounge

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:33.500
Radio.

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:37.980
And if you were to pass that off and then sell it or claim it as your own, to me, that's

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:38.460
stealing.

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.700
That absolutely is stealing.

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:46.140
And on top of that, it's not just, if I may, it's not just stealing.

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.220
It's misrepresentation of an entity.

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.260
But I want to make sure the other half of this is clear, because this is the important

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:51.900
distinction to me.

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:57.500
If you've been listening to OLR from the very beginning and you're like, I think this show

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:57.980
is great.

01:29:57.980 --> 01:29:58.620
I love you guys.

01:29:58.620 --> 01:29:59.340
And you're here every week.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.180
To that, I say thank you.

01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.300
I really do appreciate that.

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:08.220
And you go, you know what, Rob, Jamie, Loki, I'm so inspired by what you guys do.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:15.020
I want to start my own podcast inspired by you guys, because I just I listen to you and

01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:16.300
I think it's great.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.900
I want to do my own thing.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.260
Is that stealing?

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:24.140
No, because you're doing your own thing and we've inspired you.

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:33.900
But at the end of the day, did the machine learn from taking our information and analyzing

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.260
it and spitting it back out?

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:40.300
No, your brain, your human brain listened to it, was inspired by it.

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:44.780
But ultimately, you made the ultimate decision at the end of the day.

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.580
And so you were inspired by the show.

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:51.740
And that I would say would be okay.

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:58.380
Yes, SheHulk10 says, I'm on Grapefruit Lounge Radio sponsored by Fresca.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:04.220
That's the biggest thing is that it gets down into the fundamentals

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:10.940
of where the source is, where the source is, and how it's being used.

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:16.700
And on top of that, then going into the ethical side of how is this going to affect people

01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.620
who do this for their living?

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.180
All right.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.980
I think we found a sliver of middle ground there.

01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.220
So I'm going to take that, run with that, go to the next story.

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.500
So let's talk about.

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:30.220
Well, my whole thing is that I just don't think that there was an understanding of the

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.660
fundamentals of the idea.

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.160
That's all.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.800
All right, let's talk about some Atari reveals.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.400
And, you know, because I talked earlier in the show about Atari 50 and what, you know,

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.400
some of the things that they've been doing with that.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.760
And let's talk about some other things that Atari has in store.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.320
They're going to be making some games called Quantum Recharge and Haunted House.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.440
Here's the interesting thing.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.480
Again, there is actually a Haunted House reboot, remaster, whatever in this Atari.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:03.280
This is yet taking that same IP and making something else out of it.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:08.240
So, you know, again, if you want to run your own thing through machine learning, that's

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:08.480
fine.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.320
That's what Atari keeps doing.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.120
That's fine.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.640
Okay, bad joke, but I tried.

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:19.280
But Quantum Recharged is, this is going to be similar to Yars Recharge, Gravatar Recharge.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.280
These are the games that already exist on Steam.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.040
Quantum Recharged is this.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.440
Quantum was the 1982 arcade title.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.160
It's a little bit lesser known, but it is an Atari 50.

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:29.360
It's a vector based game.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:35.360
You use a trackball to get dots and shapes, kind of like Kix, but that's very much a,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:36.960
yeah, not quite.

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.840
And then Haunted House is a reimagining, of course, of the 1981 game Haunted House.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:46.160
It looks a little more like a Diablo type of game or a Minecraft dungeons, if you will.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:51.600
It's a little bit more of a, you know, dungeon crawler, which, if you think about it, are

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.280
kind of rooted in the original Haunted House game, ironically enough.

01:32:55.280 --> 01:33:00.720
So I'm not sure how, I feel like, I don't know if a lot of Atari's stuff like this ends

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:04.560
up being very quality when it is a little bit derivative of modern stuff, but we'll

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:04.720
see.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:08.400
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, because at least they've been hitting and

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.800
missing lately, which is better than only missing, which is where I feel like they were

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.920
at for a long time.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.360
So I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.920
I would like to see how this Haunted House turns out.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:23.040
Quantum Recharged Haunted House coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Switch, and

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.120
of course, the Atari VCS.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.240
Yes, that's still a thing in the press release later this year.

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:29.280
All right.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.120
Oh, geez.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.040
With that, since I brought up Atari, a great chance to take a trip down memory lane.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.400
Therefore, bring on the bump.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:52.480
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.800
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.440
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:05.280
But once a month, Dark Soccer likes to mix it up and pick a non-video game to highlight.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.800
And Dark Soccer, I really think I should just showcase this by playing this little ditty

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.840
for everybody here.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.960
I think you will agree.

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.560
Yeah, let's start off with that.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.120
I agree.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.160
Let's roll the clip here.

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.640
It's some time in the future.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.040
The ultimate challenge.

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.120
Crossfire.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:32.960
All right.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.400
You know what it is, which I swear to God came up on this show not that long ago.

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.000
I was like, Jamie, did you pick a duplicate?

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.520
But no, it's just this game came up in normal conversation.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.240
I'm pretty sure.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:51.520
I actually believe that it was this game that inspired me to do this as the segment.

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:57.520
My brothers and I had this, and I can tell you that I almost broke my face open, tripping

01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.720
over those little ball bearings.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.680
I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh at that.

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.840
I just, the way you tell that story is humorous.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:10.640
My brothers were using them as ammo for whatever they were playing with.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.280
Oh my gosh.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.960
Maybe transformers or something.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.200
Anyway, Crossfire.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:22.480
It's a game that was created by the Milton Bradley company in 1971.

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.680
This game's older than me.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:31.120
And basically you have these two pucks.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.920
One of them is sort of spirally and the other one is sort of triangular and you have to

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:39.680
shoot these little ball bearings at the puck using your little shooting guns.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:45.360
Until they hit the other side.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.400
But because the pucks are also on their own ball bearings, they can spin a little bit.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.160
The original version of it had a very flat play field.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.640
And then the later ones were a little bit dome shaped so that the ball bearings on the

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.240
pucks would roll a bit more easily.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:14.160
But also it could prevent the little balls from, you know, staying on the field and not

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.960
being able to be picked up by, you know, the player to refill their little gun.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:27.200
And then in the 2010s, the re-release just gave it slightly slip to the more shallow

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.080
grade that would keep the pucks from sliding on their own as much.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.240
So they've gone through some revisions.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.640
So basically the two pucks, like I was saying, they have a ball bearing and they are made

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:44.880
of plastic and the bearing can spin and roll with that plastic so the pucks will spin around

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.960
and move and be more responsive to the hits.

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:56.560
So basically the object is to get either piece to your opponent's goal and the first for

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.840
three goals wins.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:05.440
So, of course, the thing that most of us remember, not necessarily the 1971 edition, but the

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:12.560
1990s commercial that we just saw, that it was the post-apocalyptic crossfire.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:24.640
And that, wow, apparently the winner in that exchange, I just read this, was someone named

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.920
Tim Maynard, a Shakespearean actor who went to daytime soap opera acting.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.520
The more you know.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:45.760
Anyway, but yeah, the game wasn't as intense as they made it look on the commercial.

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:52.320
Because the problem is that you had to scoop up all the little bearings and put them back

01:37:52.320 --> 01:38:01.600
in your gun, which of course, if you're planning to get somebody with better aim, then they're

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.200
going to take advantage of the slowdown that you have when you're putting the bearings

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.520
in and, you know, send it out.

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:15.200
But yeah, I'm trying to see if I can find a picture of the 1971 version because, oh

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.160
yeah, 1971 crossfire.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.760
Rob, can I show you this?

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.600
Well, I was going to see if I could YouTube it real quick.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.480
I just sat back down.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:22.720
Sorry.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.560
I snuck AFK to use the potty, but I'll see.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.520
Yeah, I just found it.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.880
I just found the YouTube video.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.380
Okay.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.340
Yes.

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.560
I bet I can probably find it too, but give me a moment here.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.520
We'll bring it up.

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.240
Yeah.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.560
Let's look up crossfire 1971.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.200
But anyway, yeah, it's quite a bit different of a creature.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.920
It's very plain.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.720
It almost looks kind of like an old air hockey, you know, table, but

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:54.480
the, the game itself, it has been through all those different iterations of it.

01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.800
And I can see why they went with this theme when they did in the nineties, cause it is

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:08.240
very nineties, but the one thing that I can't find is what the sales rates were like for

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:08.740
this.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.360
Let me, let me try one other place.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.120
Let me try one other place.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.880
It says actually the average game lasts for 10 minutes.

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:29.760
And yeah, there's, there's no notice on here for, for how well it's sold or anything.

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.640
That's a little sad.

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.720
I was hoping to find a little bit more about it.

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:39.840
The 1971 one is way less cool looking, but it's very, very 1970s looking like even just

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.520
like down to the font that's on the table is very like seventies table game.

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.560
Oh, seriously.

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:55.120
And I'm, I'm actually a little bit, a little bit sad that I can't find, you know, what

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.640
the sale was like.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:03.520
I even looked at BoardGameGeek and tried a few other sources, but nah, no one, no one

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.320
says, although you can buy replacement balls for it on Amazon.

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:07.680
That's convenient.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:16.320
Yeah, I kind of want one now, but someone has it on, uh, Amazon for 70 bucks and I'm

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.280
not paying 70 bucks for a game they tried to kill me once.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:22.960
All right.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.800
Game that tried to kill me.

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.560
Is that, is that it?

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.200
Crossfire.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:27.440
All right.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.160
There it is.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.000
Am I, is that, and the B-roll, are we done?

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:30.500
Okay.

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:31.440
There it is.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.040
Your classic non-video game of the month, Crossfire.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:38.560
You're living in it.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:38.960
That's it.

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:42.640
My next segment for next year is going to be games that tried to kill me.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.080
Maybe I should, maybe I should just do like, uh, games that make me rage.

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.880
You still have a good seven months or no, not seven, but five months figured out.

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.840
So you got time.

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:56.960
How about all of them?

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.760
All of the above.

01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:58.260
All right.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.960
A random category, classic game category of the month.

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:04.900
All right.

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:06.960
Let's move on.

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.320
We have some rapid fire news.

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.040
That's one thing that hasn't changed on the show in a very long time.

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.680
We travel around and look at some other headlines real quick.

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:14.480
Let's start with Loki.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.640
Apparently, uh, during, during the Annapurna interactive showcase, which happened last

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:28.000
week, um, there was a brand new game from Keita Takahashi that looked, uh, like a brand

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.920
new game, uh, called, I guess, T um, it's about a, or it's a, I'm not sure.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:36.160
Yeah.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.840
T I guess is the name of the game.

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:48.080
And it's about a teen that is stuck T posing and trying to fit in to like, I guess a, the

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.640
plastic lifestyle of a quaint seaside town.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.920
It's a 3d puzzle game.

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.640
To a T they call it.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.880
It looks funny.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.680
I like, I like quirky games like that, so I'm not sure when this is coming out, but

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.920
they know that guy's the one that's going to make quirky games.

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.680
So yeah, absolutely.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.360
Yeah, no release date yet.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:13.200
It's coming out though on X-Box one, X-Box series and PC at some point.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.000
Oh my God.

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.400
X-Box exclusivity.

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.840
They shouldn't be able to buy Activision Blizzard now.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.400
In the game that I would, I'm going to call a crack for Rob.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:36.560
Uh, we have the unholy abomination of a crossover of hello kitty in a Stardew Valley animal

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.480
crossing style game.

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:45.040
Um, it is called, uh, let's see, hello kitty Island adventure.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.400
I'm sorry for your loss of time, Rob.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.800
Well, here's the gag.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.200
Hold on.

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.320
I'm trying to put the little, um, thing on the other screen.

01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:00.640
I have received several direct messages on a similar notion this week about, uh, oh,

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:03.840
I see that they have mixed hello kitty with animal crossing.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.080
Sorry to hear about your life being over.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:09.520
Um, it's, it's a mobile game.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:12.240
I'm not really interested in playing this on a mobile platform.

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:19.440
Now I've just poured it if this, yeah, if this were on switch or, you know, um, I don't

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.920
know, like a PlayStation or something.

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:24.080
Yeah, I could see it being dangerous.

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.800
But as it stands right now, like I'm not trying to like crap on mobile games.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.000
I'm just not interested in playing a game like this on a mobile device.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.400
So that's just where it stands for me.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.120
So fair enough.

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.400
Um, if someone is interested in playing, it's coming out July 28th on Apple devices.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.600
All right, let's move on.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:44.800
Dark soccer.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.840
So, um, there is, uh, well, sad news.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.600
So, um, the music producer, um, Akira complex has died.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:03.680
Um, it was announced by attack the music, which is an LA based record label that they

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.280
did some albums with.

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:12.000
Um, but a lot of the work that was, uh, done was for dance, dance revolution.

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.840
Um, and, uh, apparently it seems to have been suicide.

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:25.280
So, um, so their family and friends sending best wishes.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:31.680
Um, yeah, they also, of course, I forgot to mention did stuff for sound full text,

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:34.880
dance, fresh stardom, beat mania, two DX, and a few others.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.760
And apparently I think one of the last, uh, or one of the best known albums was from 2018

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.640
hyper synthetic.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.240
So, but at any rate, uh, may their memory be a blessing.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.040
And again, thoughts go out to their family.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.360
Their music is still with us through these games.

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.920
And we know these Bahmani games are quite the cult favorites and, you know, the musical

01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.520
live on for a long, long time.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.320
Uh, dark to see us as I do believe one of the guys that hung out with us back in the

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.360
day is that attack the music.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.240
Now, isn't that, isn't that what Bahmani style kind of turned into?

01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.480
Or am I, am I mixing up my record labels?

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.480
I can, it's been a long time, admittedly.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.880
I thought they kind of kind of transitioned from that into doing their own music label

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.920
of that type of music.

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:19.280
So I could be wrong though.

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.120
Um, it's been a long time.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.360
Uh, anyway, uh, let's talk about, uh, what's going on on the various consoles as far as

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.280
the subscription programs.

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.280
So, um, Oh, it's Oda quest.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:31.520
Thank you.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.400
Dark to see you.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:32.720
Okay.

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.080
So I'm just mixing up my names.

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.280
Apologies.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.880
There's a lot of y'all to keep track of.

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.680
All right.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.000
Um, let's talk about what's going on on PlayStation.

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:46.080
PlayStation plus monthly games for July, 2023 include call of duty, black ops, cold war.

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:47.360
Cool.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.280
For some people, I guess, uh, N Ling extinction is forever.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.400
That's like your cute little indie title.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.240
And I'm interested in this one for sure.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.240
Alan Wake remastered.

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:01.920
So not to be confused with the original Alan Wake, this is the actual remastered version

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.320
that came out not a terribly long time ago.

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.160
Probably in preparation of Alan Wake two is a good time to do it.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:15.280
If you're on the Xbox system, you can pick up these on Xbox live games with gold from

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.600
the first to the 31st of July.

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:20.320
Darkwood is the game that is available.

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:25.200
And then from July 16th to August 15th, cause they, they flip things out, uh, in the middle

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.120
of the month as well on Xbox.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:33.520
When the past was around, this is a love story of Etta and owl, who I do not believe is an

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.800
actual owl, but it is a point and click adventure type of game.

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.360
And supposedly has a really beautiful music with it.

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.320
I'll have to check that out.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.000
I'm a sucker for a good music score in a game.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:42.720
That's for damn sure.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.920
And Hey, I know usually we just talk about PlayStation plus and Xbox games with gold,

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:54.160
but a new challenger approaches because Nintendo is adding to Nintendo switch online in the

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:56.160
Sega Genesis expansion packs.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.480
They have to have the expansion pack, but you have four pretty good games available

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.480
on the Sega Genesis online, uh, that will be available.

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.000
I think is available now.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.680
I think they came out of this last week.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.180
Yes.

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.080
Revenge of Shinobi.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:10.880
Cool.

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:11.840
Ghouls and ghosts.

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.120
Land Stalker and Crusader of senti are all out.

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.800
If you have expansion pass, excuse me, expansion pack for a Nintendo switch online, which I

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.560
still don't, but one of these days I'll probably break down and get it.

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.160
All right.

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.240
If none of those recent releases are good enough for you, let's talk about some recent

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:36.320
recent releases as we travel around the world and check out some release dates starting

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.920
in the U S for games this week.

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:41.040
Loki and not a lot this week, unfortunately.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:47.120
Uh, so we've got a game called scarf coming out on PlayStation four, PlayStation five,

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:56.000
Xbox one and Xbox series, sentimental death loop on Nintendo switch and legends of heroes

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.720
trails into reverie on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:03.220
That's it.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:04.900
All right.

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.760
Let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases on the Nintendo switch.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.520
You know, it's almost as if somebody in Japan heard my complaints about hello kitty island

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:18.560
adventure, because look at what they're releasing on the Nintendo switch this week.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:24.800
Pretty princess magical garden island is one release you can look forward to this week.

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.720
And in this game, you get money and gratitude points for doing requests for the island

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.600
residents.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.600
And you can personalize, you'll create the farm of your dreams all while being a pretty

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.200
princess at the same time.

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.120
And, and there is a bunny.

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.640
I'm just going to say that there's a bunny.

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:41.860
All right.

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.280
If that's not good enough for you, guess what?

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.800
You've got little friends, puppy Island also available this week.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.080
It's kind of like Nintendogs, but they don't make that game anymore.

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.720
So somebody else decided to do their own spin on it.

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.080
And they took the Nintendogs on holiday where you can build the ultimate puppy paradise.

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:07.920
I have some friends that would take that to mean an entirely different thing, but we're

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.000
not going to go there on this program tonight.

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.600
If neither of those games are up your alley, perhaps trouble, which is final episode one

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.280
daughters of amlogram, uh, will, uh, be up your alley.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:23.040
That is also available in Japan this week on the Nintendo switch.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:30.000
Let's take a look real quick at the PlayStation five, just one release, but it's F1 2023.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.120
So if you want to get your race on in Japan, you can do that with F1 2023 from EA out of

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:39.040
Japan this week, dark Sakura.

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:39.680
How about the UK?

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.800
Um, uh, one thing on the fourth, um,

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.600
um, I don't know why, but you cut out all of a sudden we just heard the,

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.520
Oh, that was a weird blip.

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:53.920
I'm sorry.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.760
We just had an audio blip and all we heard was on the fourth and then it cut out.

01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.260
Okay.

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:06.160
So on the fourth, um, X, uh, versus ATV legends on PlayStation and Xbox.

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.600
And it's not a holiday over there.

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.160
So whatever.

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:14.880
Well, after a certain quarter of nine last week, I don't think we're having a holiday.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:17.520
This year's holiday is canceled as far as I'm concerned over here.

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.400
So, but I will be still taking the day off for it.

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:21.280
All right.

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.600
Well, I mean, I'm already off anyway, so I guess I get paid on it.

01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:30.560
I will be celebrating the art of napping that day.

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:34.880
I will be celebrating it not being a fucking hundred plus degrees that day.

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:36.240
That too.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:36.720
You're here.

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:37.280
You're here.

01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:38.640
All right.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:46.400
We have a few more headlines for you, and then we will get to listen around table, but first Loki.

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:47.760
Yeah.

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:52.560
So one of the, uh, popular games of the moment is only up.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:51:00.880
It is kind of long lines of the, um, Bennett Foddy games where they're incredibly stressful,

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.400
hard platformers.

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:02.800
Oh God.

01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:04.960
It's been pulled from steam.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:10.400
And the reason for that is because there was artwork featured in the game from a 3d artist

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.840
who had that available to purchase.

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:19.520
However, it was for non-commercial use and they used it for commercial purposes.

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:27.200
So now, um, they have to work that out, I guess, until the game, you know, is, um, available

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:30.800
or, you know, I guess they could patch it and remove that piece of artwork or something.

01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.600
Maybe, I don't know.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:37.280
It's it is a platformer game where you have to jump a bunch of, uh, models or jump on

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:38.640
a bunch of models of things.

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:45.200
So I have never heard of this game somehow in my, and yet I follow gaming.

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.360
Um, it's a popular streamer game.

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:47.760
Yeah.

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:50.400
I I'm looking, I just pulled it up to see what this is about.

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.480
It looks, I guess, pretty.

01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:58.480
Usually these indie darlings that really take off on Twitch have kind of like retro graphics.

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:01.280
So I'm looking at this one going, Oh, this one actually looks kind of nice.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.400
So it's like kind of a bunch of assets kind of thrown together.

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:10.560
Um, but you know, um, about it though, like the other thing, this is also had some controversy

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:18.720
with it as well, because originally the game, um, had some sort of NFT promotion, but then

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:24.400
of course there was rules against a tease on steam as well as selling, um, if you're

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:27.680
selling and buying them in game rather than simply promoting with them.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:32.320
So I guess, I don't know, it it's been kind of a mix.

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:33.840
The game itself looks okay.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.800
There's been people that have been watching that have been trying to speed run it, but

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:40.720
um, yeah, I'm curious to see whether that's going to happen now that it's been pulled

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.360
from steam.

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.720
I think you can still play it though.

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:44.240
If you have it, I'd assume.

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:45.680
Oh yeah.

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.200
They, they can't like take that from you once you bought it.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:52.000
So I think it's part of the agreement you have with steam.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.800
So, um, interesting.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.520
Yeah.

01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:58.400
Um, but, uh, it's, it's, uh, yeah.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:04.240
Usually these games that kind of take off on steam are not, do you think it's a Phoenix?

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:07.040
It's a only up is the name of the game.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:07.280
Yeah.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.080
It's, it's kind of like a getting over it type game.

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.400
So, yeah, I would say Twitch.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.360
I might've said steam, but it's cause I was looking at the headlines, but I meant like

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.000
Twitch.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.640
It's interesting how, you know, games can really be made on Twitch.

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.640
Meaning like, you know, I look at a game like vampire survivors is kind of a recent

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:29.600
example where it caught a lot of, you know, headwind on Twitch and more and more people

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:30.240
played it.

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:34.320
But of course, I think just, even if you want to go way back, hell Minecraft in a, in a

01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:39.280
way it was, you know, hugely made popular because of Twitch among us, obviously another

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.320
example of that in the game we brought up on the show tonight, five nights at Freddy's,

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.600
I think to some extent, maybe a little more YouTube on that one, but still, you know,

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.200
content and creators.

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:55.360
Um, it's, it's very interesting to me how much Twitch can really kind of elevate a game

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.440
to such a huge level of success like that.

01:53:59.040 --> 01:53:59.440
Yeah.

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.000
Yeah.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:00.960
And it's fascinating.

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.160
Anyway.

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:02.480
All right.

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:03.600
Let's move on.

01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:05.440
I think Jamie stepped AFK.

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:08.080
So look, you do want to go to the next story you had and we'll go back to hers.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.120
Yeah.

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:09.680
Sounds good.

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:16.800
So this is funny because actually this is a little bit more of a local story, if you

01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:17.300
will.

01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:26.880
So, um, Dave's retro games in, out of Sacramento, California, um, down at the Folsom flea market.

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:29.120
I think it's Folsom flea market is what they call it.

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.080
It is.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.200
Cause when I first saw this story, I was like, Oh, is it out of denial?

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.360
And I was like, Oh, it's at that place.

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.280
Well, I think I've been there.

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:38.720
I've been there once.

01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:38.880
Yeah.

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.320
I've been in this one too.

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:42.240
I actually, uh, not that long ago.

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:45.440
And I would never go there on a day like today because that whole place is hot.

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:46.880
Balls.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.160
It was, yeah, it was hot when it was like 80 degrees down there.

01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.600
So like, yeah, absolutely.

01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:52.400
No way.

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:55.920
Um, but yeah, they, he's had the store for 35 years.

01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:02.720
Funny enough, back when I was in my previous role, a previous job, I actually almost was

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.040
selling to this guy, except he, he wanted to buy used product and we didn't really have

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:07.600
any of that.

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:13.520
And when it came to game stuff, but my coworker dealt with him on a direct basis for selling

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.000
used VHS tapes at this time.

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:20.560
But yeah, so he is trying to get out of the business.

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:27.360
He has posted his business up on Craigslist and looking for a buyer for $1 million.

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:36.000
Says he has about 35 years and 20,000 games there and looking to sell everything with

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:36.500
it.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.680
That's one, one way to get rid of your inventory.

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:40.820
Yeah.

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.120
Here's the problem though.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.120
This is the rub here.

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.600
And they did a little piece I saw on like good day, Sacramento as well, talking about

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:50.080
it and stuff.

01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:54.320
He was showing off like some of the products they had like talking about like video game

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:54.820
collecting.

01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.200
The fact that he has that kind of inventory isn't necessarily notable.

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.960
It's what condition it is in.

01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:07.360
And as a personal, my personal experience with his inventory, it's trash.

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.800
It is garbage.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:16.160
It is in such a disarray, disorganized mess with like the quality of like loose games

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.440
and the labels falling off.

01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:21.920
And so I remember when we went there, I was looking for specific like NES games and good

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:25.760
luck finding them because there is no organization to it whatsoever.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.640
Just all out of all sorts of order, just stacked on top of each other, like behind a glass

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.200
case.

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:34.400
He's got a few box games, but like he was showing, it's like, Oh yeah, Pokemon.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.960
This one's, this is a sealed copy of Pokemon.

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:40.800
It's worth a lot of money, but you look at the box and the box is just smashed the hell.

01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:46.480
Like it's just he is delusional if he's thinking he's going to get a million dollars for this

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.520
is what I'm saying.

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:50.080
Yeah, like good luck.

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:54.160
But like I was not of like particularly impressed when I went there.

01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.160
Just there was nothing there for me.

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:59.760
Granted, it was years ago, you know, and I don't know what's changed because it was before

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:00.640
the pandemic for sure.

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:02.960
And probably even like 2017 was right when I was there.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.000
It was a long time ago.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.400
Yeah, well, we went not that long ago.

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.160
It was probably about a year or two ago.

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.040
So like, it was not in good shape.

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.600
Like I know there was another guy that was at denial.

01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:14.320
Oh, that guy.

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.440
Maybe the same.

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:15.760
Yeah.

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:19.680
I was wondering if you'd been to this play star, Zara.

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:20.320
Oh, of course.

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.440
Do you remember Trader Dan?

01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:26.080
That was the one that's in denial.

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.120
Yeah, that's him.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:28.320
Okay.

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.080
Yeah, this guy's at Folsom.

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:31.680
No, this guy's at the Folsom market.

01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:31.920
Yeah.

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:32.880
Okay.

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:33.360
Okay.

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:41.600
Yeah, because, I mean, we used to go to when Trader Dan was in the, I can't remember the

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:44.800
community now, but we used to go out there.

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:48.560
But yeah, anyway, God crazy.

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.060
Yeah.

01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:50.160
All right.

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:52.240
Well, let's go Dark Soccer.

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:56.480
You were going to talk about, since we're talking about retro games, an interesting

01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:57.280
rerelease, right?

01:57:58.240 --> 01:57:58.480
Yeah.

01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:03.280
Although, I mean, it's hard for me to think of one of these as obscure because I've

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:04.560
had a copy forever.

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:16.160
But Retrobit is doing two rereleases for Sega Genesis slash Mega Drive.

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.080
Pre-orders are up.

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:27.120
But one of them is Syldis, which we had for Sega CD a Sylfis with an F.

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:35.760
But it was released in 1990 for the Sharp X68000, also as Sylfis.

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:41.600
The game is a fun shooter.

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:43.440
It has really beautiful artwork on it.

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.400
So it's a horizontal shooter by Wolf Team.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:50.080
I have not done it as a classic game yet, but maybe I will.

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:55.360
And then the other one is El Viento, which is a side scrolling action game that came

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.080
out in 1991, also by Wolf Team.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:00.880
And it had a female protagonist.

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:07.200
It is definitely that 90s anime style, you know, dirty pair Cutie Honey looking.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.120
I mean, like later Cutie Honey, not like 70s Cutie Honey.

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:11.680
But anyway.

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:18.320
But yeah, they're coming with the slipcover, clamshell case, cartridge, the manual.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:28.720
And each of these are open to order from now to July 30th for $54.99 US and to ship out Q4.

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.380
All right.

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:34.160
Listen up, collectors.

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:38.080
Although if you're a true collector, you already have it, right?

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:45.120
If you're an even truer collection, you have the X68000 and you've got the original discs.

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:49.600
Uh, Dartitsia in chat says, I remember Soul Feast on Sega CD.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.800
Not as familiar with El Viento, but it seems like a fun action platformer.

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:54.160
Soul Feast was fun, though.

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:58.320
Wouldn't top Gradius in the shmup department, but more shmups aren't a bad thing.

01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.480
It wasn't a bad game at all.

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:03.440
It was in a saturated market, I will admit.

02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:07.680
Questmaster says, I wish they'd also reissue Ernest Evans.

02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:13.440
So lots of, uh, lots of old school releases.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.400
I'm still waiting for the Guardian Legend to be remade.

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:18.640
That's, that's, that's it.

02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:24.080
Once, once somebody finally remakes the Guardian Legend, I've hit all I want in game.

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:24.580
What?

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:25.600
That I couldn't think of.

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:26.720
We're playing Gaiden.

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.480
Oh, really?

02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:29.360
Play the Japanese one.

02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:29.860
Oh, fun.

02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:31.840
The game couldn't get past the first level.

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.240
Don't tell him I said so.

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:35.200
You just ratted him out.

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:35.700
All right.

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:37.920
I don't know if I could anymore, to be honest.

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.000
It's been forever since I really sat down and played that game.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:40.960
I should do that on stream.

02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:46.320
And I did it with a, on a, um, on a delay on the, the big TV in the front room.

02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:50.800
Dr. C says, I did pitch TGL to the folks at Bitwave.

02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:51.920
So cross your fingers.

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.320
Who the, well, we, we went down this rabbit hole of who owns the rights anymore.

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:56.720
Right.

02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:01.440
So it's just when somebody wants to make it, they'll make it, they'll pony up the money.

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:01.940
Anyway.

02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:04.160
Uh, let's talk about one more.

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:08.560
So earlier we were talking a little bit about how like a game can be made or broken.

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:09.520
Well, not broken.

02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:12.560
I was just saying a game can be made and bolstered up by Twitch.

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:18.480
I have never heard of a game not making it because of its Twitch performance, but this

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.600
is a very interesting thing.

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.040
It's crash team rumble is the game we're going to talk about.

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.520
And there's some headlines going around about how it's struggling on Twitch.

02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:33.200
Uh, a website video gamer has noted that the total number of Twitch users watching crash

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:36.560
team rumble has sunk pretty low.

02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:42.880
It's only down to like double figures, meaning like 40 people on all of Twitch watching this

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:49.920
game, even though, uh, it was like 12,000 at its peak, the average is somewhere a little

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.800
more in like the 300 type of range now.

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:58.720
Um, that's not great, but that also probably has to do with the fact that the game really

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.720
didn't review very well.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:06.640
Um, also, uh, like to put it in perspective, aliens, dark descent, which was an RTS game

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:12.480
that was released the same day as crash team rumble has about an average of 4,600 viewers

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.840
over the last week.

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.160
Uh, and at the same time, it was noted that 40 people were playing crash team rumble about

02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:24.640
2,200 were playing alien stark descent, uh, F1 23, which was also released, uh, at least

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:31.520
here anyway, uh, 4,700 final fantasy 16, 50,000, which isn't very surprising to hear

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:32.560
about that at all.

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:37.760
Um, but of course, crash team rumble, it's got a Metacritic score of 68.

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:39.920
Why do we care about how it's doing on Twitch?

02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.560
Because the game play and crash team rumble is all about online multiplayer.

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:48.320
Unlike final fantasy 16, as some of those other games, they don't rely on multiplayer

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:49.280
crash team rumble.

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:55.760
It is that so attracting an online viewership that can help bolster the game anyway.

02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:02.880
Um, so it's, um, it's struggling a little bit to get noticed and break through, which

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:10.400
means, Hmm, I wonder if, uh, it will be around much longer if it doesn't start to perform

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.040
better.

02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.280
So I don't know what it's going to need, but I have to be honest, releasing the same week

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:18.480
as final fantasy 16 for me, not a good idea.

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.880
There was no way this game was going to hit my radar with that game out, but I also realized

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.320
not everybody's me, but it doesn't seem like, unfortunately, unless you're one of those

02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:29.760
40 people, the game is really registering on your radar either.

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:31.680
Oh, all right.

02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.160
And with that, that was the last scheduled story we had for tonight.

02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:38.000
I do want to open up the listener round table.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.520
If you have any, um, questions, comments, concerns, uh, or calls, you can always go

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:45.760
to our discord and speak with us through the week.

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.000
vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.320
And if you want to give us a call tonight, just join the green room channel, which is

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:56.960
over there, uh, under the, uh, uh, general channels.

02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:58.560
No, just kidding.

02:03:58.560 --> 02:03:59.280
I don't know what I'm talking about.

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:00.320
It's in the network show channels.

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:01.120
You'll see the green room.

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:06.400
You join that and you can, uh, be waiting to call in vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:09.200
Um, a few things.

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:12.640
I actually have a last minute headline tonight because I forgot to read it earlier in the

02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:17.360
show when I was talking about BlizzCon, but I wanted to mention this is coming.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.880
World of Warcraft classic hardcore is about to be officially embraced by Blizzard, meaning

02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:27.200
death equals delete.

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:28.880
That's what hardcore is to be fair.

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.600
Hardcore is a thing that exists in Diablo.

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:37.360
So the concept of existing in World of Warcraft as well is not exactly farfetched considering

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.120
some feel that World of Warcraft plays more like Diablo than it does the original Warcraft,

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.080
to be quite honest.

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:43.920
But, uh, I digress.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:49.920
World of Warcraft classic hardcore is going to be officially implementing this concept,

02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:54.080
which means if you die, you don't get to go to a ghost and go back to life.

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:57.360
You cannot be resurrected with ancestral spirit.

02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:01.520
You can also not use the warlock soul soul stone.

02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:06.000
So I don't know, like this is like those moves kind of exist for those, but anyway,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.520
that's how they're drawing the rules.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:09.120
That's going to be very hard.

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:15.440
Um, your character will not disappear when they die, but they will be a ghost.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.440
So you can stay in touch with your guild mates.

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:21.200
You can literally haunt your guild mates as a ghost.

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:24.960
But you can also, uh, what's interesting about this too.

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:28.720
You can do free transfers to non hardcore servers.

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.320
I like that a lot.

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:33.440
So if you are playing hardcore and you get really attached to the character and then

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:36.240
your character dies like randomly, cause that's always the way it goes.

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:37.760
It's like, Oh fuck, a lag spike.

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:38.240
I'm dead.

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:42.800
You can actually move that character to a non hardcore server and continue it.

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:43.520
That's cool.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:44.960
Um, I like that.

02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:48.080
That's very similar to what path of exile does with their hardcore mode.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:51.360
Um, anyway, there will be other restrictions.

02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:56.160
Um, not available in regular world of Warcraft.

02:05:56.160 --> 02:06:01.200
You cannot kite a monster from one area to another to try to get it to attack low level

02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:01.760
characters.

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:02.800
Good.

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:08.960
You cannot deliberately flag yourself for PVP before you can attack another player.

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:12.400
So they're trying to, um, stop that from happening.

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:14.400
Also, they're annoying shit back in the day.

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:19.280
They're also going to be de-emphasizing PVP in classic hardcore altogether.

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:24.160
You cannot queue for battlegrounds, but there will be a dueling mechanic.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:25.520
If you're feeling so bold.

02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:31.680
If you slay an opposing player, you get a cosmetic buff called string of ears.

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:35.360
They tracks the number of players that you have successfully tracked down.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.080
That sounds very, uh, like the clown.

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:38.400
Yeah.

02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.560
Very with his finger team.

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:41.700
Anyway.

02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:44.720
Or the Teramisu cake with all the fingers around it.

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:45.220
Anyway.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:46.800
Someone made one.

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.400
I saw that it was wild.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:51.280
If you want to test that it is on the PTRs now.

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:52.720
So that could be very interesting.

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:56.960
Break Man in chat says haunting your friends sounds fun for about five seconds.

02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:57.460
Yeah.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:58.400
I don't know.

02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:02.000
I've played hardcore in Diablo and it's fine.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.720
I'm not at the mercy of other players, but of course, World of Warcraft, I just would

02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:06.320
never turn on PVP mode.

02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:07.840
That sounds completely uninteresting to me.

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.440
But I have done hardcore runs in Diablo and it is a little, I find that I play the game

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.800
much more conservatively.

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:16.720
Like I do not push difficulty.

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:21.680
I stay on baby and I just grind, grind, grind, grind, grind to get to like max level.

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:24.240
Cause at some point I'm going to do it in Diablo four.

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:27.040
I'm probably just waiting for seasonal play to do it.

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:30.080
It makes a little more sense to me to do a hardcore character then, because I think

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.800
it'll be high risk, high reward in seasonal play.

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:35.120
So I'll try it then.

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.160
But I don't think, I think we're getting the date for the first season next week.

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:42.320
It'll probably, it's, I can tell you when that first season is going to start.

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:44.880
It's going to start the last weekend in July.

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:46.800
How do I know it's going to start that weekend?

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.240
I'm going out of town.

02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:49.920
That's why it's going to start that weekend.

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:54.240
You know what, Rob?

02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:54.880
What's that?

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:58.080
I kind of miss us playing like wow together back in the day.

02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:59.280
I miss wow too.

02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:04.000
I miss your character, Rebecca black, especially when she was, she headlined pride here in

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.920
SAC a few weeks ago.

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:07.920
I was telling people about Rebecca black.

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.680
And her new music is pretty dope.

02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:10.240
Actually.

02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:12.080
She's in her mid twenties now, believe it.

02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:16.640
It's like, I was reading a story on the John and Kate plus eight kids.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:18.800
You know, those kids are 19.

02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.520
They're adults.

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.040
Yeah.

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:24.560
God, when did, when did, when did age happen?

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.720
Anyway, um, every day, every second.

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.640
I, by the way, I had a birthday this last week and I forgot to talk about that.

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:34.640
I did a birthday stream because there's some birthdays.

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.360
There's some, I actually played some, a few things.

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.840
I played, um, no man's sky as well.

02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:45.040
The first, um, I hadn't played the new expedition in that game and I cleared the first set on

02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:45.360
stream.

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:47.120
It took me like maybe two hours.

02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:48.320
I kind of rotated games.

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:51.680
I did like, I think I did theater them for two hours.

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:52.080
I did.

02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:53.280
I did it by daylight at the end.

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:55.200
Cause Alan came on and play with me for two hours.

02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:57.440
Um, play with me too.

02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.280
We had such shit killers.

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:01.440
This event is bringing out the worst in people.

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.240
It's so wild.

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:05.600
Well, it's actually been 50 50 for me kind of.

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.840
Either they're like, that night was not fun.

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:14.320
Either they're the ultimate in sweat or they're like really cool and want to farm because

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:15.920
Hey, five cakes.

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:16.160
Yeah.

02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:16.640
You know?

02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:16.880
Yeah.

02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:18.400
That's what I miss.

02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:25.440
I miss in these events when the killer would just be standing in the middle, hitting the

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:30.080
palette over and over again or whatever, hitting an object in the train to, to signal that

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.320
like, come get hit, come get hit by the killer.

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:32.880
Let's farm.

02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:34.160
I haven't seen a single one of those.

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:40.160
This whole, we've had, we've had a few off and on, um, mostly it's been like, like we'll

02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:42.720
every so often, like I've had a fun Sadako.

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.960
Like the thing is, is that one thing to remember is that I play with Shayla.

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.320
Oh yeah.

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:49.440
Who is the killer whisperer?

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:50.000
That's true.

02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:52.800
Chaela is the killer watch.

02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:53.040
Yeah.

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:58.560
Although I'm, I'm not bad at it, but, but like, I, and, and actually I think I got one

02:09:58.560 --> 02:09:59.680
person who knows me.

02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:04.640
So actually I did, it was somebody who was on my friends list.

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:12.960
It was, uh, uh, like, uh, Meg loves Anna and I was playing my Meg and they were playing

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:15.760
the huntress and I was the chosen Meg.

02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:18.000
Not a single hit.

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.960
And then when I realized it was my friend after I was like, Oh my God, it was my friend.

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:23.920
That was cool.

02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:26.160
That's only ever happened to me once.

02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.200
It wasn't the killer though.

02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:28.240
It was another survivor.

02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.120
I queued up.

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.640
It was probably about a year ago.

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:36.400
I went into solo queue and I had Kate with one perk because I was trying to level Kate

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.360
Denson for whatever reason.

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:38.480
I was just trying to prestige.

02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:42.400
And of course who, who, who ends up in my lobby has lands.

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:45.520
Now how the fuck am I, was I in the same?

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:50.240
I guess that's how, you know, I was like MMR is broken.

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:52.240
Cause there's no way I should be in the same survivor.

02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:53.520
MMR has lands.

02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:54.400
Absolutely not.

02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.920
Unless he had some sweaty killers back to back to back that like dropped him significantly.

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:00.960
But that made me giggle.

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.440
I was like, Oh, that's fucking random.

02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:07.120
So yeah, I've had cam in my lobby before his killer.

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:08.800
That's wild.

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:08.960
Yeah.

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.880
And I've had a few other people.

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:11.680
I've seen that happen.

02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:15.280
Like I've seen people playing and then, um, they go actually.

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:18.640
Was it has playing once when losing color was the, I mean, that's, this shows you how

02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:19.280
long ago it was.

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:22.240
Cause losing color has been a little bit in the retirement home for a little bit from

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:25.920
DVD, but, uh, they were the killer for one of the games just randomly.

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:26.480
I want to say.

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:33.920
I, I still was always like, I always wanted to get LC as nurse and I, and every nurse

02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:35.040
game I'd be like, what are they wearing?

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:38.960
Is it combo nurse with the Rose thing?

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:40.800
So yeah.

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:41.300
Yeah.

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:44.000
Anyway, uh, let's see.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.040
Uh, I wanted to check in on any other final thoughts.

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.040
I have a question for, for folks.

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.840
If, uh, nobody's gonna drop any in chat, but, uh,

02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.440
Yeah, we didn't get an email.

02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:56.400
Loki, did you have any, uh, participate at orange on traded.com.

02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:00.400
If you want to send an email, but I'm going to caution again.

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.760
I am at that fate again.

02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:02.320
Here we are.

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:05.120
Here we are friends again.

02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:06.960
I'm asking you to donate $20.

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:07.600
I'm so angry.

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:08.160
No, I'm just kidding.

02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:13.200
Let me pictures of your cats, but we have an empty mailbag and when we have an empty

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:17.200
mailbag for six weeks in a row, I start to go, should we have a mailbag segment?

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.080
So anyway, yes.

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:19.140
All right.

02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.960
It's the communicate with orange lounge segment, whether it's, so it's all encompassing.

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.320
I know we send me pictures of your animals.

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:33.040
Uh, Loki, do you have any, uh, last minute stories before we, uh, think about wrapping

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:33.540
it up?

02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:40.560
Um, yeah, based off of, uh, a job listing posted by EA, it is rumored that the next

02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:46.640
Sims entry will be free to play, which makes sense because they already monetize it.

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:48.160
Like it's a free to play game anyways.

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:51.920
It just wouldn't be charging upfront costs anyways for it, which is kind of what they're

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.160
doing now with Sims four anyways, because the base game is free to play and they probably

02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:57.840
have success with that.

02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:02.160
But yeah, it's, it's already microtransaction that, you know, the wazoos.

02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:03.920
So why not?

02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:08.800
I can't, it'll be a big marketing thing for them.

02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:09.360
It's free.

02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:10.420
Yeah.

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:12.080
I can see them doing that.

02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:13.840
Absolutely free asterisks.

02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:15.940
So.

02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:22.240
Randomly this week, I had to get the tire on my car replay or patched basically, because

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:27.760
unfortunately, um, I ran over not one, but two nails somehow, or they were placed in

02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:31.440
my tire, but I don't know how that happens, but anyway, luckily it was patchable.

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.120
And the cool thing is a lot of tired, like they'll just do it for free because they want

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:35.760
your business.

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:40.480
And I went to the place I always go to anyway, but here's the thing across the street.

02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:42.080
From the place was a Walmart.

02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:45.280
I don't usually go into Walmarts, but I'd had time to kill.

02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:47.760
So I went in and you know what Walmart sells.

02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.600
They sell arcade one up machines.

02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:53.440
And you know, when I look at another one, when I look, no, I did not buy another one.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.320
But when I look behind me here, you're going to notice I have this, I have one machine,

02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:04.560
two machine, and they have this interesting blank space before we get to the third or

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:06.400
before, excuse me, before I get to the couch.

02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:10.240
So I have this perfectly sized space for a third machine.

02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:17.440
And I will say I saw a Ms. Pac-Man arcade one up that connects to the internet.

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:19.120
It's like a newer version of it.

02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:22.480
And it has all the cool Namco games like Mappy and shit connects to the internet.

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:25.360
But I got to say that one looked really good and I was tempted by that one.

02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:29.760
But then I saw like three down from it was a mortal combat one that's new.

02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:31.520
And it's the first three mortal combat games.

02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:32.480
But here's the thing.

02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:38.000
A lot of the arcade one up machines also include libraries of games from the same publisher.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.800
And that means it has the Midway classics like bubbles, joust, robotron, like that machine

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:46.240
is fucking stacked.

02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:49.840
And it's Wi Fi compatible now in the new one.

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:56.400
And so I texted Alan a picture and I said, Alan, tell me not to do it.

02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.160
And he just basically replied to lol.

02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:04.160
The only reason I didn't get it was because at that point, two reasons.

02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:08.240
One, I knew that I may have to get my tire replaced.

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.000
And that would have cost me $150.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.520
That's like half a machine right there.

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.200
So I was like, I better not spend the money until I know if I need a tire or not.

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:19.520
And my husband and I went out for a belated birthday dinner.

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:21.520
We went out to a Brazilian steakhouse.

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.200
There's a new one in Roseville.

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:23.920
That's where we went.

02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:26.480
Some chain that just showed up in Roseville.

02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:28.160
We went there and it was fine.

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:32.720
But because I had a cocktail and a dessert because it's my birthday.

02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:36.160
It was, you know, those Brazilian steakhouses, $200.

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:39.600
So that was my fancy birthday dinner.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.680
And that was pretty much the cost of a machine.

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:45.360
So that stopped me from doing it.

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:49.520
But I guess my question to everybody is, should I have pulled?

02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:50.880
Should I have got the damn machine?

02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:52.180
Sure.

02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:53.460
Yeah.

02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:56.000
I think you still still should do it.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:56.640
I might.

02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.120
I might.

02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:02.400
We're not the ink is not dry on that decision yet.

02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:02.960
So we'll see.

02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:07.440
And then bring it to my house.

02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:08.640
And then bring it to your house.

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.160
You don't have any arcade one ups in your house, do you?

02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:14.480
Because you only have the real things.

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:15.600
I have my two little ones.

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:18.160
Not like the size that you have.

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:19.440
Yeah, you have the little table.

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.560
Actually, I love those.

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:21.280
The tabletops.

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:24.560
I have yet to see one again since I saw him at Target a few years ago.

02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:31.200
Well, actually, if we talk, I might be interested in selling my Dig Dug.

02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:32.240
Okay.

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:33.760
Work because I like Dig Dug.

02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:34.260
Okay.

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:36.160
It's a Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2.

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.720
Yeah, I have another one that's got Dig Dug on it.

02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:42.240
So I didn't realize when I got it, but we already had Dig Dug.

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:42.560
Okay.

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:42.800
Yeah.

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:43.920
And Dig Dug 2 is not.

02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:46.800
But it's a dedicated Dig Dug.

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:49.360
I'm actually pretty good at Dig Dug.

02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:53.040
I don't mean to talk my game up, but I'm pretty good at Dig Dug.

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:53.760
All right.

02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:54.320
We'll talk.

02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:58.240
I got it pretty inexpensive when I got it.

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:00.720
And we'll talk.

02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:03.280
SSG100Matt says Costco sells the tabletop ones.

02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:04.320
Like only on their website.

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.080
Allen goes to the store every month and is always looking.

02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.320
In fact, he saw an arcade one up at Costco once and was fucking teasing me with it.

02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:15.760
It was a super Pac-Man with wood paneling.

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:16.260
What?

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:17.680
Yeah, at Costco.

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.200
This is, unfortunately, this was, I think, the year the pandemic started.

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:22.160
I think it was 2020.

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.120
And I was like, no, don't buy it because I don't know.

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:29.840
And now I've never seen an arcade one up there since.

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:31.040
And it was a super Pac-Man.

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.280
If only I had a baby Pac-Man.

02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:36.960
I know, right?

02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:37.440
Me too.

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:38.240
Me too.

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:42.240
I didn't even see one at Golden State, by the way.

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:45.200
They had the Got Lied Pac-Man.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.360
They did not have a baby Pac-Man.

02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.640
And I was beside myself for all of five seconds.

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:55.680
But I would love, I would love the tabletops because the tabletops will fit in my closet

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:56.240
much better.

02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:57.600
Unfortunately, I was going to move.

02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:01.040
The BurgerTime will fit in my closet.

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:02.880
The Tron will not.

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:05.440
You can see on stream, and I apologize to the podcast listeners.

02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:08.720
You can see there's a height difference between Tron and BurgerTime.

02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:10.960
And the closet is like right here.

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.280
So Tron wouldn't fit, but BurgerTime would.

02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:17.760
But I've already had to talk to Allen about, I have a problem.

02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:19.520
What happens if I get more of these machines?

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:22.240
But we might, if we had to, we might move them into our bedroom.

02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:24.640
We have a wall in our bedroom that's not being used for anything.

02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.160
It's just like empty.

02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:27.680
So I'd probably move it in there.

02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:30.640
All right.

02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:33.440
Well, with that, I think we're going to move and wrap up the show.

02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:36.160
But thank you as always for tuning in and listening to our show tonight.

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:37.040
We appreciate it.

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.680
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Songs Radio, please tell a friend.

02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:42.720
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:44.560
But we need more voices to put out here on air.

02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:45.600
Tell a friend or two.

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.360
A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is you found this

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:51.360
awful long way.

02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:51.840
Guess what?

02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:55.440
You won't find it on, I mean, you couldn't find it on Stitcher anyway, but guess what?

02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:56.480
Stitcher's going under.

02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:02.240
So sorry to everybody out there who used Stitcher, but our show hasn't been on it for years because

02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:06.480
when I told them they needed to update our show, they said it was our problem.

02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.080
And I pointed out that every other podcatcher out there didn't have a problem.

02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:13.760
And they still said, I said, pull the feed.

02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:17.120
I'm not going to have people emailing going, why haven't you updated the show in six weeks?

02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:18.000
Pull the feed.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.400
So we haven't been on Stitcher in a long time.

02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:24.560
So I'm sorry to those that use that, but as far as far as I'm concerned, it's a win

02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:27.360
because we were not compatible with that platform.

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:30.080
Anyway, to be fair, it was under a prior owner.

02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.840
It was not under their current owners.

02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:35.120
So I have, but you know, when you burn a bridge, it's hard to build back.

02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:36.160
All right.

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:39.280
Anyway, I didn't mean to end on the name.

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:42.800
I say when, when bridges get burned, just shove people off the end.

02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:45.920
Yeah, well, that's, well, that's kind of what happened here.

02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:46.160
All right.

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:49.840
Anyway, uh, that is, uh, that is it.

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.760
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:52.240
Dark soccer.

02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:53.120
Your final thoughts tonight.

02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:59.920
I am feeling kind of, uh, ill, but I am dedicated to breaking ankles tonight.

02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:02.240
So we'll see what happens.

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:03.200
All right.

02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:04.080
Have fun.

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:06.400
Oh, also I have, um, an interview for a position.

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:08.320
So everyone wish me luck luck.

02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:10.720
Good luck later.

02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:10.960
Later.

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:11.520
My taters.

02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:12.880
All right.

02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:14.240
Logie we're over to you.

02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:14.960
Your final thought.

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:21.920
Um, my final thought is hopefully look forward to a new episode of my Minecraft series this

02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:22.160
week.

02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:23.680
Nice.

02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:29.520
Um, my final thought is I have two more days off work and I'd really love to beat final

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:30.960
fantasy 16.

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:34.800
I off stream caught up on all my side quests, so I'm ready.

02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:38.800
I'm hoping we don't have, um, too much further to go, but we'll see.

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:40.960
Actually, but at the same time, it's like, I kind of don't want it to end.

02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:42.080
It's really good.

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:45.600
Um, but yeah, I'm hoping maybe in the next couple of days I will finally beat Final Fantasy

02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:48.000
16 and then I can, uh, surf the internet.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.640
Uh, spoiler worry concern.

02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:54.400
I feel like I've hit most of the big spoilers at this point, but we'll see.

02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:56.480
I mean, there's, there could always be more to come.

02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:59.920
So, um, yeah, I'm looking forward to beating Final Fantasy 16.

02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:01.200
That's it.

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:04.480

And even though I know it is July 2nd and Pride Month is now over because of some things

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:21.440
that happened in this country last week, I am extending Pride Month by one more week.

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:21.920
Deal with it.

02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:22.240
