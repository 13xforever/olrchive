0	13280	What do Orange is the New Black and Genshin Impact have in common?
13280	16900	They made their rights holders billions of dollars and their creative cast a pittance.
16900	20140	One of them was unionized with insufficient contract terms for a new medium.
20140	21380	The other is non-union.
21380	24280	Both of them have financially struggling independent contributors.
24280	27780	Today in America, the Writers Guild continues to strike, the Screen Actors Guild now on
27980	31360	numerous gaming and other firms unionizing or unionized and the people are making long
31360	32880	overdue needs happen.
32880	34500	This is the Collective Bargaining Headline.
34500	37620	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
37620	40660	the gaming side of this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on
40660	43700	the show where every gamer has a voice.
43700	48380	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
48380	53840	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
53840	55860	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
55860	62420	We're live once again, episode number 968 of our show for tonight, July the 16th of
62420	64020	2023.
64020	66140	It's a very hot night.
66140	69740	I think in most parts of the country, but especially where we're based here in Northern
69740	70740	California.
70740	76900	Me, I'm Rob Roberts, and I am joined every week over the last 21 plus years with my co-hosts.
76900	80060	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
80060	81060	Hi.
81060	82060	Hi.
82060	83940	Now, Jamie, it is so hot outside.
83940	85840	Why are you hanging out by a campfire?
85840	88420	That's what I want to know.
88420	92320	And pretending that it's a cold night that requires the campfire.
92320	93320	Okay.
93320	97920	Although my mic, you see where my mic clips in?
97920	98920	Yeah.
98920	99920	Technology.
99920	104440	So the problem is that anything that's kind of white is actually what's trying to show
104440	113480	through my background thing, and this application isn't robust enough to have different balance
113480	114480	detection.
114480	115480	So yeah.
115480	116480	All good.
116480	117480	All good.
117480	121560	And also joining us with the green screen effect tonight.
121560	123320	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
123320	124320	Hello.
124320	125320	Hi, Loki.
125320	126320	How are you?
126320	127320	Pretty good.
127320	128320	Good.
128320	130400	You playing DDR in the garage in this heat?
130400	132160	Not this year.
132160	133160	Not this year.
133160	134160	Okay.
134160	135160	I see.
135160	136160	I see.
136160	139020	Yes, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific,
139020	143640	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
143640	144640	That's vognetwork.com.
144640	146980	Also, of course, on Twitch at vognetwork.
146980	151420	And yeah, Bobby Black Wolf is actually in chat and points out the arcade is off.
151420	157740	Yes, I did intentionally turn it off tonight just to save that little bit of extra energy.
157740	163340	It is 108 degrees today, which is at least what the weather app said last I opened it,
163340	165700	but it is a very, very, very high temperature.
165700	171020	And although I'm feeling okay, like the AC is on full blast, I just every little bit,
171020	175700	and I don't think these things generate a lot of heat, any little bit of heat, I'm turning
175700	176700	it off tonight.
176700	181060	So I'm sure you can understand why we don't have the ambiance of Tron and Burger Time
181060	185300	running in the background tonight, which are the two arcade machines that I have in my
185300	186640	office.
186640	193220	For now, I'm always looking at like, oh, I have this very obvious empty space between
193220	194220	the couch.
194220	195220	Hmm.
195220	199460	Anyway, we'll see what comes, we'll see.
199460	204300	So we're going to jump into our first topic tonight in gaming news.
204300	208860	And this has been what a lot of people have been talking about as this gets closer and
208860	209860	closer to reality.
209860	214220	Loki, do you want to kick us off with the latest and greatest on what is going on with
214220	219860	the Activision Microsoft merger and how the finish line I think is in sight?
219860	222140	Yeah, we're getting there.
222140	230220	So the FTC had a lawsuit that was out to try to stop it was basically an injunction
230220	236540	to stop the merger while they have their own like, I guess there's another court case that's
236540	237540	going on.
237540	239720	That's not until August, though.
239720	245900	But they're trying to basically force the merger from going through.
245900	249300	And that unfortunately failed in the courts.
249300	255240	And so in the United States, there's not really anything kind of stopping them now.
255240	259580	So that's good, at least.
259580	264840	So now we have to just wait, I guess, to whenever their next court date is, which I think is
264840	265840	in August.
265840	273060	But I know that Microsoft had basically a deadline that they had to meet in order to
273060	276540	avoid paying penalties.
276540	279740	But I mean, it's, I guess supposed to be going through.
279740	286380	Along with that, though, you know, they did make a deal as well with PlayStation to guarantee
286380	290880	that Call of Duty is going to appear on their platform, which I know was a major contention
290880	297020	point for at least I think the FTC and even I think in the UK regulators as well.
297020	299820	So be kind of curious to see what's going to happen with that because I don't think
299820	305260	they've ever resolved the whole UK thing as well.
305260	311220	So yeah, it's just right now figuring out what the UK the CMA is going to do.
311220	318100	And now that these new kind of events have happened, you know, especially with the deal
318100	323380	in Call of Duty, does that mean that Sony is not going to be pushing against it now
323380	325620	because they got kind of what they wanted?
325620	332420	Or are they going to try to, you know, there's nothing left to push against Sony's out of
332420	333420	options.
333420	335380	They tried their best to stop the deal.
335380	336700	It didn't work.
336700	337700	They're out of options.
337700	342540	In fact, my understanding is at least what's coming through is that now what Sony is ultimately
342540	346980	had to sign here is not as good as what they were offered before.
346980	354440	They were offered before all of this the offer to have all Activision games on their platforms
354440	356260	for five more years.
356260	357420	That's not what got signed.
357420	361640	What got signed was Call of Duty for more years.
361640	367620	So they're going to lose the other Activision titles like, you know, maybe on a case by
367620	368680	case basis.
368680	373280	But I think we all should be prepared for they're going to lose things like if there's
373280	380120	ever an Overwatch three potentially, you know, things like that, Diablo updates and things
380120	381120	like that.
381120	384640	I don't know if Sony would or excuse me, if Microsoft would withhold all of that.
384640	387340	I don't think it's in their best interest to withhold things like Overwatch three or
387340	390120	Diablo four expansions and so forth.
390120	395400	But it's there are going to be big games that Activision releases that do not come
395400	398320	to Sony now.
398320	401040	And that's that's that's the cost to do in business, I guess.
401040	402040	Yeah.
402040	405040	And the CMA said that, you know, Microsoft and Activision have indicated that they are
405040	410640	considering how the transaction might be modified and the CMA is prepared to engage with them
410640	412360	on this basis.
412360	417820	And seeing as that the agreements already been modified and Sony's basically agreed
417820	418980	to something.
418980	423780	So I'm wondering if that then changes what's going on with this.
423780	428740	But we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
428740	435220	But yeah, next week's gonna be interesting.
435220	436220	Yes it is.
436220	443400	I'll be very curious to see what happens with what happens overseas and how I mean, because
443400	446720	they're trying to close that deal on Tuesday.
446720	451900	So if we don't hear an excuse me an announcement tomorrow, because keep in mind, everything
451900	454640	overseas is about eight hours ahead of us.
454640	459780	So if we don't hear something tomorrow, I don't know what happens at that point.
459780	466180	You know, we've we've heard talk about that Microsoft could just pluck their entire operations
466180	470940	out of the UK or out of Yeah, out of the areas that are where they could do that temporarily
470940	474900	to until they get you know, you know, everything situated.
474900	476700	Yeah, it'll be very interesting.
476700	479800	Interesting to see what happens with that for sure.
479800	484120	We'll just get Konami to publish those titles, you know, like, they didn't know the region.
484120	485240	So that's fine.
485240	488940	Tiger Claw on chat says Sony needs a Call of Duty killer, but in the past, they had
488940	496120	games like it, but they weren't as good Well, you know, here's reality check for many gamers
496120	499680	out there, not necessarily the ones here listening to this show, but I want I need to give a
499680	503060	reality check to a lot of people out there.
503060	508400	For those of you that have said for years and years and years, I don't, I don't buy
508400	511200	into Xbox, Microsoft, I don't buy into them.
511200	512280	They don't have any exclusives.
512280	516960	I like they don't they don't have anything I like I halo halos overrated, Microsoft doesn't
516960	517960	have anything.
517960	518960	No.
518960	519960	Congratulations.
519960	520960	Congratulations.
520960	525200	This mergers for you.
525200	526420	You did it.
526420	527480	You did it.
527480	531680	Now it's going to be a lot harder to say that, isn't it?
531680	534840	Moving forward that Microsoft I mean, this, of course, I'll be people that still say it.
534840	538700	That's you know, how it is some people have to be right all the time.
538700	546180	But the reality is Microsoft just bagged a lot more diverse exclusives through this deal.
546180	551720	And all of you that have been banging the drum saying, I don't buy Microsoft products
551720	555640	because they don't have good exclusives.
555640	558180	Congrats you played yourself.
558180	560340	Yeah.
560340	565360	And it's it's kind of silly the whole console worse thing anyways, because like, if you
565360	568920	just if you just play on PC, you're really eating good.
568920	571880	So like, I don't know.
571880	573360	I don't know it.
573360	574360	It's silly.
574360	577180	It's also like, look, and I'm not I'm certainly not anti Sony by any means.
577180	578240	I think you all know by now.
578240	579840	I love all the gaming companies.
579840	583000	I'm critical of all the gaming companies when it's deserved as well.
583000	586140	That's how that's how we work here at Orange Daunt Radio critical that you love.
586140	587140	That's right.
587140	588140	Absolutely.
588140	595640	So don't, don't sit here and feel sorry for Sony, because they have plenty of must have
595640	596640	exclusives.
596640	600280	You don't hear people even in the Microsoft camp, you don't really hear I mean, there's
600280	605080	always these extreme people, but you for the most part, do not hear people saying oh, Sony
605080	606560	doesn't have any exclusives.
606560	607560	That's why I don't play PlayStation.
607560	609040	So I don't have any exclusives.
609040	614920	You know, Sony has plenty of exclusives between the God of Wars, The Last of Us is that there's
614920	616920	plenty of things that Sony has.
616920	623500	And you know, there's obviously a lot of that chatter about well, how is Sony going to counterpunch
623500	624500	this?
624500	625780	Are they going to buy Square Enix?
625780	628420	Are they going to buy insert company here?
628420	630300	What's the counterplay here?
630300	631780	To get more exclusives?
631780	635620	Honestly, I just don't want I don't want to see any more consolidation.
635620	639220	Really the only reason I wanted Microsoft to buy Activision is to get rid of Bobby
639220	640220	Kotick.
640220	641220	Yeah, I'm 100%.
641220	642220	That's that's really it.
642220	649080	I don't like the idea of more consolidation because that worked well in the cable industry
649080	653600	and the internet industry and all that stuff like it doesn't it's not great.
653600	657320	Like they're not evil right now.
657320	662120	But like if they have a big majority, then there's nothing really stopping them from
662120	664000	just manipulating the whole market.
664000	670920	So it's, I don't know, it's not necessarily like a huge win to see them like, take Activision
670920	671920	Blizzard.
671920	674900	Yeah, I just want Bobby Kotick out because he's just awful.
674900	676180	But 100% I'm with you.
676180	679860	I've never liked the big fish eating big fish merge.
679860	686540	But unfortunately, this specific merger has another more important component.
686540	689400	And that is the removal of Bobby Kotick from the industry.
689400	693220	And yes, I know he stands to make a disgusting amount of money from this deal.
693220	694220	I do.
694220	695820	He makes a disgusting amount of money from everything.
695820	699780	Well, I hope he is sued, quite frankly, by some of the people that were formerly employed
699780	701820	by him to recoup some of that money.
702560	708040	That is a whole other issue when and hopefully that occurs is he owes some of that money
708040	712000	back to a lot of the people that he's heard over the years, but that is neither here nor
712000	713000	there.
713000	715960	The important part is, he won't be in this industry anymore.
715960	720520	And he can fuck right off to some desert island after this and enjoy spending all that money
720520	727440	on getting himself fanned and, you know, cocaine every weekend, if that's what he wants, to
727440	728440	be quite frankly.
728440	731640	But I just stay out of this industry.
731640	733140	He's done no good for it.
733140	738140	Let's see, going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
738140	741860	Dejirama S says, what's interesting about is that among the people I know who have been
741860	747060	following this merger, 99% of those people don't give a damn about Kotick.
747060	752540	I mean, that says about those people.
752540	753540	I know.
753540	754900	Yeah, I'm trying to be nice.
754900	756140	But there you go.
756140	757900	I don't need to be nice about it.
757900	761460	That says a lot about those people if they don't care how he's treated his employees.
762040	765360	I can say that some people don't follow the business.
765360	768800	Some people may really truly not know how horrible it is on the inside.
768800	773680	But I hope maybe this merger can be a chance to educate said people.
773680	774680	That's that.
774680	776800	Let's see other comments.
776800	781160	Tiger class says now Microsoft will own quite an extensive library of games Activision is
781160	783120	filled with so much gaming history.
783120	790280	I'm super curious how fast this moves, meaning are we going to get some major games on Game
790300	791820	Pass next week?
791820	793000	Because I could see it.
793000	797620	I could see like assuming everything I could see like next Friday, they fucking throw down
797620	801900	Diablo two remastered Diablo three on Game Pass.
801900	803820	I could see it if not Diablo four.
803820	808080	I think I think that might be a little bit too wishful thinking.
808080	811540	But I could see that some of the Activision backlog is going to get added to Game Pass
811540	819020	real quick, which will be very exciting, especially because breaking news alert.
819040	825080	Apparently, it has just come out that Microsoft intends to change the pricing on Game Pass.
825080	826560	What a what a convenient time.
826560	828080	Well, let me take this back.
828080	829880	We knew they were changing the pricing.
829880	833720	We actually talked about last week or the week before that the price of Xbox is going
833720	834720	up.
834720	839680	But now we just learned tonight Xbox Gold is essentially getting replaced with something
839680	841040	called Xbox Core.
841040	844720	They are no longer going to give away monthly games with it.
844720	849820	They're going to have instead of a smaller library of Xbox games.
849820	856580	Like honestly, like honestly, like with the Microsoft giving away games each month, like
856580	861940	I forget half the time that they're doing that because I don't go in there to like because
861940	864140	I don't have a console hooked up, so I don't go in.
864140	866480	The quality has dipped for some years.
866480	872340	I actually think the 25 game library is probably ultimately going to be a better deal.
872340	874340	Yeah.
874960	880040	Because they'll probably be first party Microsoft games in that pack, maybe not the newest of
880040	886280	the new, but like Halo Anniversary Collection, I'm going to I'm going to Rob Stradamus, Halo
886280	889840	Anniversary Collection, one of those 25 games easy.
889840	895080	It's an older title, not selling a lot these days, really good show off of what Microsoft's
895080	898260	got to offer on their variety of consoles.
898260	900040	That's a very, very safe prediction.
900040	903760	But I would say you're going to see first party titles like that will make up those
903760	905360	25 titles.
905360	908500	Forza Horizon, I would bet would go into that too.
908500	915060	Maybe not the latest and greatest one, but I believe three is still up and running, right?
915060	917180	I don't think they pulled the servers for three.
917180	921660	So whichever one they still got the servers on for would be a part of that 25 as well.
921660	927300	So I think it'll probably be a very, very okay, they delisted except for five.
927300	929660	Okay, then four will be up.
929660	931540	Oh, licensing.
931540	937880	So I think that those are all safe battle four is delisted to Wow.
937880	938880	All right.
938880	941760	Well, maybe they do put five in there because five is a year old now.
941760	951380	But anyway, it's gonna be 25 mostly first party Xbox games that will be in that collection.
951380	956400	Maybe a couple third party games that you know, Sony does but you know, now, now that
956400	958760	they have Activision as well.
958760	963560	And you know, Bethesda, like Skyrim, probably in that bundle as well.
963560	964560	But we'll see.
964560	967360	We'll see what comes out for that.
967360	969960	Okay, anything else on the merger to talk about?
969960	973800	No, we'll just wait until this week.
973800	974800	Yeah.
974800	980920	But by the time we do the next orange lounge radio, we should either have a unified Activision,
980920	987780	Microsoft, Blizzard is now all one company or some fuckery overseas has stalled this
987780	989400	whole thing yet again.
989400	993020	So it could be very I'm very curious to see if in a week, we're talking about new game
993020	994020	pass games.
994020	997600	Well, they can't because if they don't go through, they owe $3 billion.
997600	1003920	So like, it's, I they will, it will go through there unless it legally cannot go through
1003920	1007920	if they stop it in the UK, they'll be like, I'll need the UK.
1007920	1009920	Yeah, I guess that's what happens at that point.
1009920	1010920	That's true.
1010920	1011920	All right.
1011920	1015960	Okay, well, let's talk a little bit about the things that have been going on in our
1015960	1019720	gaming weeks, whether they've been Microsoft games or not.
1019720	1022280	In a segment we call How was your gaming week?
1022280	1023520	So dark soccer, we'll start with you.
1023520	1025160	How was your gaming week?
1025160	1028260	Um, warm.
1028260	1036000	Actually there was a good bit of playing pinball this weekend, Dan's working on our whitewater.
1036000	1039680	It ended up being a little bit more of a money sink and we thought it was going to
1039680	1047760	be excuse me, I played of course, some Dead by Daylight wanted to wrap up the last couple
1047760	1054000	of things in the anniversary.
1054000	1057080	So that was that was pretty fun.
1057080	1063140	I also did my last stream of Marvel's Midnight Suns, I'm going to be going back to retro
1063140	1069100	games and I'm thinking about starting off with like a few simple games just to demonstrate
1069100	1070740	what they are.
1070740	1077780	Before I decide if I want to go back to Star Ocean and pick up where I left off, or if
1077780	1082160	I want to come back to it later and start on something new, I'm sort of thinking about
1082160	1085660	Tales of Fantasia.
1085660	1089140	I've also got Rudranohil on my list.
1089140	1096380	I have Marvelous Return to Treasure Island on my list, the original Live Alive, Great
1096380	1101980	Battle 5, there's a there's a few on my list, there's even a Kunio-kun game that's also
1101980	1102980	on my list.
1102980	1103980	So we'll see.
1103980	1108740	Oh, and the original Rayearth RPG for Super Famicom.
1108740	1115000	So we'll see, I've got a I've got a list, I'll put it up to a vote.
1115000	1122880	Also, you know, doing my stupid wordscapes and I'm still loving the new Cult of the Lamb
1122880	1126760	DLC and I finally beat it on stream.
1126760	1132200	So I'm still gonna like I'm gonna try to think of something else to do for my late Monday
1132200	1137640	night or, you know, that isn't just going right back to Dead by Daylight.
1137640	1143660	So if anyone has any suggestions for other things they'd like to see, let me know because
1143660	1149140	otherwise I might go back to playing virtual pinball.
1149140	1150140	Awesome.
1150140	1151140	Yeah.
1151140	1155840	All right, Loki, we'll go to you, your gaming week.
1155840	1156840	Let's see.
1156840	1158260	So Minecraft to start off with.
1158260	1162860	So I've been working on the stuff for my next episode, which I've gotten a lot of builds
1162860	1166620	done, but then I realized I need a lot more builds since because I need to finish the
1166620	1171520	whole interior of the base, the part in the mountain.
1171520	1175840	So I've been working on that right now and hopefully be done that soon so I can do the
1175840	1179960	editing because there's going to be lots of editing this episode, the last three episodes.
1179960	1183480	So down to the final three.
1183480	1185560	I did play other games though this week.
1185560	1191960	So we did Channel 64 plays where we all got together and played Among Us, which I've never
1191960	1195400	played before, funny enough.
1195400	1196400	So we did that.
1196400	1201640	Unfortunately, I was I wasn't an imposter the first two rounds, which is not good for
1201640	1205920	someone that hasn't played the game because, like, I don't know where any of the jobs are
1205920	1206920	or anything.
1206920	1211040	So I was like, I don't know what I'm doing.
1211040	1213800	But yeah, we played a little bit.
1213800	1215720	I kind of got the hang of it after a little bit.
1215720	1217280	And then I wasn't an imposter anymore, unfortunately.
1217280	1218280	Were you a shapeshifter?
1218280	1220240	Yeah, I was too both times.
1220240	1221240	Yeah.
1221240	1223240	But I didn't really know what I was doing.
1223240	1224240	Yeah.
1224240	1225240	So it's funny.
1225240	1230920	One of the advantages of being the shapeshifter is even if you're caught and the the crew
1230920	1232840	wins, you still win.
1232840	1234680	Oh, that's funny.
1234680	1235680	Yeah.
1235680	1238160	Because then you're converted into a crew ghost.
1238160	1239400	Yeah.
1239400	1241800	So what else?
1241800	1246760	So I played that I played Gravity Circuit, which was a game that we had behind me last
1246760	1247760	week.
1247760	1252240	The one that's kind of like, I think it's like Shovel Knight.
1252240	1253720	It's definitely like Mega Man Ninja Gaiden.
1253720	1254720	Yeah.
1254720	1255720	And it plays.
1255720	1258080	It's set up like a Mega Man type game.
1258080	1260720	It's pretty hard, actually.
1260720	1261800	But it's pretty fun.
1261800	1267320	You kind of your there's like this virus that's taken over all the robots that are in this
1267320	1273080	area and you've got to go like defeat these old you're part of like this like team of
1273080	1274560	robots that were defending everything.
1274560	1278640	Of course, the other ones have corrupted and now they're evil and so you have to go defeat
1278640	1279640	them and stuff.
1279640	1280760	But it's pretty fun.
1280760	1281760	I really like it.
1281760	1282760	It's kind of fun.
1282800	1289480	There's elements of Metal Slug in there and Ninja Gaiden and certainly probably Shovel
1289480	1290480	Knight as well.
1290480	1296560	I haven't played Shovel Knight yet, even though I have it in my library for like a long time.
1296560	1299040	But I'm sure it's got kind of all those different elements.
1299040	1300440	So it's really worth it.
1300440	1301440	It's a fun game.
1301440	1306320	I haven't picked I haven't played this yet, but I picked it up this week.
1306320	1312640	I saw an announcement from Limited Run Games that they are saying that they're going to
1313520	1317200	do a physical version of Riff Tracks the game like that's out already.
1317200	1322480	So we so I need to find some people to play that with because I love me some Riff Tracks
1322480	1325640	in Mr. Sans to your 3000 and that looks like a lot of fun.
1325640	1330640	It's kind of like a set up like a Jackbox game where you watch a clip and then you add
1330640	1337920	like a funny, you know, snarky comment to go with it in it in an AI voice reads it for
1337920	1339180	you during the clip.
1339180	1341680	So it's like you're doing your own MS3TK.
1341680	1344960	So it's going to be pretty awesome.
1344960	1347080	Yeah, I've I've played that on Twitch.
1347080	1350960	A friend of mine, Troy takes photos, streams that a lot on his Twitch channel.
1350960	1351960	And I played that once.
1351960	1352960	It's cute.
1352960	1353960	It's funny.
1353960	1354960	Yeah.
1354960	1357040	When you say AI voice, though, it's like it's like speak and spell lady.
1357040	1360480	Like it doesn't sound like it sounds fake.
1360480	1362480	It's that whole type of thing.
1362480	1363480	It adds to the humor.
1363480	1364480	Yeah.
1364480	1365480	Yeah.
1365480	1366480	So awesome.
1366480	1367480	That's it.
1367480	1368480	Good.
1368480	1369480	All right.
1369480	1370480	My gaming week.
1370480	1373720	I played Final Fantasy 16, which I've talked about for weeks and weeks on the program,
1373720	1375640	but I finally beat the game.
1375640	1377620	So obviously, I'm not going to spoil too much.
1377620	1379240	But was I satisfied with the ending?
1379240	1380240	Yeah, pretty much.
1380240	1383800	It was it was it was a fine ending.
1383800	1386680	And you know, obviously, I don't want to spoil too much.
1386680	1389320	Overall, my impressions of the game are favorable.
1389320	1391240	Is it the best Final Fantasy game ever?
1391240	1392240	No.
1392240	1393240	Is it in the top half?
1393240	1394640	Yeah, I'd say it's in the top half.
1394640	1399400	It's it's, you know, it's there's a lot of really good things about it, the combat system,
1399400	1401120	even though yes, they went action based.
1401120	1403320	It's really freakin satisfying.
1403320	1405600	And there's a lot I really enjoy about it.
1405600	1407600	The story, of course, is very well done.
1407600	1412160	You know, I think the comparisons to like, it's a television show, where the pilot episode
1412160	1416600	was that demo they put out, which was a strong like must must see TV.
1416600	1420300	And then you know, the rest of the series was definitely a good series worth your time
1420300	1421320	to watch.
1421320	1422920	Were there a few filler episodes?
1422920	1425880	Yeah, yeah, there were some filler episodes.
1425880	1428800	There were some moments towards the end that were getting a little dull.
1428800	1433120	There were some choices they made with the story I did not care for.
1433120	1437800	Again, I'm going to bite my tongue because I don't want to inadvertently spoil something
1437800	1441880	that's all I can really say the the one thing I will say because you know, of course, a
1441880	1447200	Final Fantasy game will have a bad person so I can say that I will say the the overall
1447200	1455520	big bad in the game week did not enjoy the character is just very super tropey to me.
1455520	1460620	In fact, that was honestly the weakest part of the plot was the the villain.
1460620	1464980	But there's other things that kind of help compensate for that, which is why I'm not
1464980	1466480	like bad on it.
1466480	1470140	But I again, I would I would be spoiling to get into further detail.
1470140	1473000	And that's all I can really say.
1473000	1475600	In six months, all bets are off.
1475600	1480680	But until then, Quest Buster says Final Fantasy 16 was really enjoyable for me really enjoyed
1480680	1481900	the story and the characters.
1481900	1484600	It definitely had a few rough edges, but overall good stuff.
1484600	1487080	Yeah, like that, that pretty much sums it up.
1487080	1490880	There are some parts that don't add up very well.
1490880	1495320	Like the crafting and the shopping system feels very like it's only here because it
1495320	1496320	has to be.
1496320	1499720	But like the hunts ended up playing out very well.
1499720	1505280	Some of the side quests just as good as the main quest, the characters for the most part
1505280	1509600	with the exception of the villain and maybe one other of the dominant characters.
1509600	1513160	I thought they were all who is I'll just say kind of also an antagonist.
1513160	1517240	So those that play the game know who I'm talking about, I would say all of the dominance were
1517240	1518240	really good.
1518240	1522120	Even, you know, there were actually a few of them that were antagonists, there's only
1522120	1528640	one in particular towards the end that I didn't care for, but the others were all really good.
1528640	1531400	So yeah, it's a lot of good stuff.
1531400	1538920	I also appreciate that when they said we made a game without needing DLC to enjoy the complete
1538920	1540560	story, they meant it.
1540560	1544360	This game has a definitive start and a definitive end.
1544360	1548280	I can see where they could put DLC in it if they want to.
1548280	1554280	And I could see one potential thing that DLC could be about for sure, because if you look
1554280	1562280	at the various icons or dominance that you come across in the game, there is one very
1562280	1568320	obvious element that is missing is referred to in a throwaway line, I think just to cover
1568320	1574840	that base, but they could explore more about like what happened to this, what, especially
1574840	1579040	when there was a whole I feel like something got cut, because there was a whole I'll just
1579040	1582940	I'll just say this isn't a spoiler because they've shown all the icons in the previous.
1582940	1586960	It's Leviathan is missed the water icon Leviathan is missing.
1586960	1590720	And they refer to Leviathan as like the old Leviathan.
1590720	1595600	But there's a whole sequence towards the end that very much involves water and like ocean
1595600	1600460	traversing and things happening in the ocean where I'm like, I feel like there could have
1600460	1603800	been a Leviathan plot here that's just not there.
1603800	1609600	So I I'd be curious for them to explore that a DLC will be very, very curious to see.
1609600	1613440	So um, but that's my thoughts on Final Fantasy 16.
1613440	1617440	Otherwise I have been playing other games as well back on Diablo four in preparation
1617440	1619840	of season one starting next week.
1619840	1626040	So if you are a Diablo four person, and you plan on playing the season, really good tip,
1626040	1631960	go get all the Lilith statues uncovered and go uncover the entire map because those things
1631960	1634360	will roll over into your seasonal game.
1634360	1638760	That is not only reknown boosts, but stat boosts for your character right out the gate
1638760	1644960	and that's going to really help with getting the jump on the character.
1644960	1648560	Quest Buster chat says, I also had a feeling that things might have been cut too.
1648560	1652400	I don't want to spoil, but it kind of felt weird to suddenly have a huge side quest dump
1652400	1653720	at that part of the story.
1653720	1655840	Yeah, no, I hear what you're saying.
1655840	1662400	And if they don't do DLC with 16, I hope I actually and either way, I actually really
1662400	1668000	hope they do a Final Fantasy 16 to I feel like they've got such a solid foundation that
1668000	1674120	if they were to build upon that, and there's one character who I would love to see them
1674120	1678200	base a 16 to around and again, you're gonna have to read between the lines.
1678200	1685400	This character is kind of has an it has a ambiguous like you're not sure kind of fate
1685400	1686520	at the end.
1686520	1691280	So I would love to see them make a 16 to based on this character, but even if it's like multiple
1691280	1697680	characters, or I mean, Jill actually might make for a great story kind of very, very
1697680	1704520	yrp from Final Fantasy 10 to I would love to see Jill be the star of the spin off spin
1704520	1705520	off game, actually.
1705520	1710180	So I actually hope that there is a 60 or I'm not saying Clive is gone, because Clive could
1710180	1711840	be there too.
1711840	1716920	So we could, you know, I'd love to see a variety of things were 16 to could go.
1716920	1718880	So we'll see.
1718880	1723680	Anyway, uh, I guess that's really it.
1723680	1729320	Randomly, I played Overwatch two today, because one of my friends really wanted to play a
1729320	1730320	game online with me.
1730320	1732120	And I was like, Okay, well, what do we both have?
1732120	1733680	And we decided we both have Overwatch.
1733680	1738400	And the good news, I actually won, well, we won both matches, I knew what the hell I was
1738400	1739400	doing.
1739400	1742020	I was and I even had to play tank one of those matches.
1742020	1748240	But it turns out, I am a pretty decent, decent, chaotic Winston, meaning I love to just when
1748240	1752200	everybody's fighting at the front, do the Winston thing and jump to the back and punch
1752200	1753520	the healers in the face.
1753520	1756460	It's very satisfying.
1756460	1758900	So I remembered how to do that in Overwatch.
1758900	1759900	That was my gaming week.
1759900	1762680	All right, we're gonna get into some gaming news.
1762680	1764760	Just a quick reminder.
1764760	1769840	Will not be here in two weeks, we will be here next week for Episode 969.
1769840	1773960	But we will not be here in two weeks live because I will not be here I'm going to be
1773960	1774960	out of town.
1774960	1776040	But for a great reason.
1776040	1781840	I'm going to be in Atlanta, Georgia, or the area I should say and I'm going to be at the
1781840	1789560	Southern Fried Gaming Expo, which is taking place July 28, through the 30th in the Atlanta
1789560	1790960	area.
1790960	1796660	You can get more information, I believe the websites game atl.com is the website for that.
1796660	1798580	And I'm very, very excited about this.
1798580	1803920	I'm actually going to be hosting or moderating a panel there and it's a really good one.
1803920	1807300	It's with some of their big guests that they actually have and you can actually see this
1807300	1813780	in the app, which is available now through a site called yap is where you go to get the
1813780	1814780	app.
1814780	1819080	This is a panel I'm going to be on called Nintendo voices live.
1819080	1821580	It's going to be Sunday one o'clock.
1821580	1829160	And on this panel, there's me next to some awesome voice actors that play Nintendo characters.
1829160	1833460	So it's Samantha Kelly, who's the voice of Princess Peach and Toad, Kenny James, the
1833460	1838780	voice of Bowser and Laura Faye Smith, the voice of Princess Rosalina are going to be
1838780	1840080	on that panel.
1840080	1841540	So I'm really excited about that.
1841540	1842540	That's gonna be a really cool panel.
1842540	1847640	And I'm really thankful to the folks at Southern Fried for giving me that opportunity to moderate
1847640	1848640	that discussion.
1848640	1850180	It's gonna be a lot of fun.
1850180	1851780	So looking forward to it.
1851780	1858060	So we'll see you there in the Atlanta area next or weekend after next July 28, through
1858060	1859060	the 30th.
1859060	1862480	I don't know if that panel Bobby was saying something about the panel being recorded and
1862480	1863480	put online.
1863480	1867080	Maybe I don't know how Southern Fried does their panels after the fact, if they put them
1867080	1873760	up on YouTube or what, as far as I'm concerned, if, if they don't put anything up at all,
1873760	1876440	because they want people to be there live at the show, then I completely understand
1876440	1877440	that.
1877440	1878440	But I'll let you know if they end up putting it online.
1878440	1879440	Okay.
1879440	1882520	Bobby says they do record some and put them on YouTube.
1882520	1886120	Also, Bobby here from the voice geeks network, of course, he's going to be there as well.
1886120	1887700	And it's going to be in his backyard.
1887700	1890280	And you know, Bobby loves the speed running community.
1890280	1895360	And he's going to be there with an eternal enigma, who's also a part of the games done
1895360	1899440	quick has done a lot of the announcing over the years, and also to speed running on their
1899440	1904780	own and is going to be doing I think it's Silent Hill homecoming is the game that they're
1904780	1909180	going to speed run live at the convention and talk about, it's going to be a little
1909180	1911840	more than what you might see during games done quick, because again, they're wanting
1911840	1914240	to kind of talk about speed running.
1914240	1918200	And like what all goes into that, because remember, the audience isn't speed run enthusiasts,
1918200	1922240	it's gaming enthusiasts who want to maybe find out more about speed running.
1922240	1923240	So it's pretty cool.
1923240	1928920	You can actually see I think last year's panel that was Silent Hill for question mark is
1928920	1929920	up online.
1929920	1932240	So stay tuned for that.
1932240	1933860	All coming up with the Southern Friday.
1933860	1934860	Thank you.
1934860	1938520	Bobby says it is on the vog YouTube channel, which I rarely promote, because we unfortunately
1938520	1939800	so rarely have content up there.
1939800	1943800	But that is a great piece of content to take a look at over on our YouTube channel at vog
1943800	1945360	network.
1945360	1949000	Okay, let's get into some gaming news from the week.
1949000	1953840	And this has been getting a lot of chatter around this first story tonight.
1953840	1954840	Loki.
1954840	1960320	Yeah, so the Genshin Impact voice actors say they're not getting paid and they want to
1960320	1961320	unionize.
1961320	1967380	I mean, I would do if I wasn't getting paid as well.
1967380	1975140	One of basically, we had a couple different people on it says on July 12, like Corina
1975140	1981240	boater, or boater and Brandon wickler, two boys actors who have voice characters in Genshin
1981240	1984980	Impact, we did about how frustrated they were in cleaning that money was owed to them and
1984980	1989380	hadn't been paid in months.
1989380	1991380	Basically said after the fifth email, no response.
1991380	1996400	This is regarding Genshin Impact excusable for us actors to be waiting for plus months
1996400	2000800	for pay when you have 80 when you make 86 million per month.
2000800	2007280	Unfortunately, this is not a common problem, or not an uncommon problem.
2007280	2011400	So yeah, it's kind of irritating that I mean, I guess it makes sense.
2011400	2012960	All industries seem to be doing this.
2012960	2020460	I mean, we have the whole actors and writers strike right now in, you know, in Hollywood.
2020460	2026780	So of course, this kind of treatment extends outside of that industry as well into gaming
2026780	2027780	and whatnot.
2027780	2030780	But yeah, everybody should be paid on time and fairly.
2030780	2034940	Yeah, so it doesn't make sense that they're just going to just Oh, we'll pay you later
2034940	2037380	because these people will count on this kind of stuff.
2037380	2043180	But they're trying to are they trying to put all the blame on a third party with this too?
2043180	2047820	Like they're trying to say it's the organization or I don't know, it's kind of messy.
2048820	2058820	Yeah, so let's see, basically, um, I don't see any details regarding a third party in
2058820	2059820	here.
2059820	2063300	But basically, they said that, you know, this project made billions.
2063300	2066020	This project should be a union.
2066020	2068780	And this wouldn't happen if the game was a union.
2068780	2071780	Tell them to make the game sag.
2071780	2077780	Yeah, I don't think you I don't know if I mean, I guess.
2077860	2083020	Voice actors would be part of the sag they could be well they okay, so they could be
2083020	2086900	right like, you know, especially your large ones like Jennifer Hale, I'm almost certain
2086900	2093220	are part of sag because you might remember, a few years ago, we had a sag strike in the
2093220	2098540	voice actor gaming space, you know, it's been a little bit but they actually did.
2098540	2103000	So this current strike going on actually doesn't impact video games.
2103000	2106580	And if you actually go on to the strike website, where it talks a little more about what they
2106580	2109380	can and they can't do.
2109380	2112620	Sag after folk are allowed to voice video games right now.
2112620	2117660	That is not something so you know, a lot of people could be kind of talking things.
2117660	2121420	But if you actually go to the strike website, it'll actually say in one of the infographics,
2121420	2127260	they are allowed to work on video game voiceovers because that is that is a separate contract.
2127260	2131820	Just like broadcast TV stuff is a separate contract.
2131820	2138380	So long story short, Julie Chen hosting Big Brother, she can do that because technically
2138380	2143300	that is it's weird, but it's under broadcast news, basically, so it's a part of that contract.
2143300	2147660	Okay, so I do see the part of regarding the third party of the trans claims.
2147660	2153220	So a representative from Ohio verse made a statement saying that we truly regret to learn
2153220	2158820	about the ongoing situation Genshin impact values and respects the work of everyone involved.
2158820	2163020	And we support our voice actors claim to their proper do we have made payments to our
2163020	2167620	recording studio on time, and we have immediately urged the studio to pay our voice actors.
2167620	2171500	So they're basically putting the blame on a recording studio.
2171500	2174140	Okay, sure, whatever.
2174140	2180180	I mean, I guess we'll have to see because ultimately, like, you know, yeah, you could
2180180	2184340	make that argument that, you know, Oh, well, we paid this vendor, they didn't pay them.
2184340	2191420	So but like, ultimately, you're responsible for that, you know, because you hired them.
2191420	2197820	And Jason is in our chat and points out the strike is against the AMTP AMPTP contract
2197820	2201180	specifically, which I think is Academy of motion, man, like all the ocean, we heard
2201180	2204780	all this stuff that they talked about, like with that, like, Oh, hey, we're gonna, oh,
2204780	2208380	the AI is Oh, yeah, it's awful.
2208580	2215780	How ironic, you know, with Netflix in the whole brand new season of Black Mirror, it's
2215780	2220540	like, it's like, this is literally what we're talking about this scenario that you put on
2220540	2223940	your platform, you just like, you don't see the correlation here.
2223940	2228420	It's like, we've literally talked about this, yeah, on your own platform.
2228420	2234020	And in here, you're doing the thing that the long and short of it is that the emotion picture
2234020	2239860	companies want to be able to have AI generated background actors, which to some extent, we've
2239860	2245540	seen computer generated background things before, but they want to be able to scan people
2245540	2250020	when they come in for a day and then use them as their likeness in the background and not
2250020	2251460	pay them for it.
2251460	2252460	It's bull.
2252460	2253460	That's, yeah,
2253460	2254460	that.
2254460	2259940	No, they, they should inherently understand what's wrong about this request.
2259940	2260940	Yeah.
2260940	2262340	I mean, I can't.
2262660	2267540	Sjo 100 Matt in chat says if you haven't heard it yet, listen to Fran Drescher's speech.
2267540	2269580	Yes, she did do a very good job.
2269580	2270580	I do.
2270580	2274420	I do want to remind folks, she had some not so great perspectives during the COVID-19
2274420	2275420	stuff.
2275420	2281380	But I'm going to just acknowledge this particular case, she did a very good job.
2281380	2283860	And that speech was very well done.
2283860	2287260	And you know, you would expect coming from an actress that it was going to be well done.
2287260	2288260	But she did.
2288260	2290020	She did deliver for her union on that part.
2290020	2293060	Yes, she did a very good job with that.
2293060	2295220	So yeah, it's, it's very good.
2295220	2299780	And yeah, if you look at the again, the millions and millions the executives make these same
2299780	2304380	executives who are fucking yanking projects, you know what the you know what the fucking
2304380	2310420	irony is of this whole thing, the irony of this strike and all that.
2310420	2313940	I bet we get a Batgirl release now.
2313940	2315400	That girl's probably gonna get released now.
2315400	2316980	You know why?
2316980	2319780	Because all this shit that they archived and threw in the vault is going to be all that
2319780	2320860	they have left to release.
2320860	2326660	I don't think they can because they already took the tax payment from that they got the
2326660	2328380	their return on that already.
2328380	2330340	Wasn't the right off this year, though.
2330340	2331340	Oh, fiscal year.
2331340	2333900	Yeah, so they can't do that.
2333900	2335780	I mean, they can try doing that.
2335780	2340700	But then they're going to be in legal trouble with, you know, well, the taxes, but like,
2340700	2341700	I don't know.
2341700	2345640	So the last time there was a writer's strike, they did, they started pulling in shows from
2345640	2348060	Canada was one thing that they started doing.
2348060	2354080	And then now that you know, you have all right, a lot of international stuff, time to shine,
2354080	2357660	you can't do it on television coming back, right?
2357660	2358660	They've tried.
2358660	2364020	Honestly, they have tried and it failed, but I know I don't want anything to succeed in
2364020	2371100	light of the strike, even that I want the actors and the union to and the writers to
2371100	2372100	get a fair deal.
2372100	2373260	That's what I want.
2373260	2376940	So even if it costs so you can't do that on television reunion or whatever you want to
2376940	2381860	put on, but South Korean TV shows will be another big one that will probably come from
2381860	2382860	this.
2382860	2383860	So game shows.
2383860	2384860	Oh, yeah.
2384860	2385860	Game shows.
2385860	2386860	SS Joe 100.
2386860	2393020	Matt points out reality shows using YouTubers and streamers.
2393020	2395060	Mr. Beast getting a game show.
2395060	2398620	Yeah, you better kind of his whole panel is already a game show.
2398620	2401660	You better hope they resolve this strike quick.
2401660	2404220	You better hope.
2404220	2408980	So anyway, back to the issue at hand, though, against an impact.
2408980	2414900	I mean, obviously, this is probably going to put more pressure for more video game productions
2414900	2416980	in general to be union based.
2416980	2418540	So it could be very interesting.
2418540	2423180	By the way, sorry, but do you know what the interesting gray area with this whole thing
2423180	2424180	right now is?
2424180	2428660	And I'm very curious about this considering I host panels at conventions, and I don't
2428660	2432700	know what's going to happen if Dragon Con comes up, because you know, as part of this,
2432700	2439380	they cannot promote their projects, future or past.
2439380	2445300	As part of this, they are allowed to do convention appearances, they're allowed to do photos
2445300	2448300	and autographs and that whole thing because it's, you know, obviously, they know this
2448300	2451900	is how like Star Trek actors like make their living these days, right?
2451900	2455040	Is these convention appearances and many folks that do that circuit as well.
2455040	2458180	So they don't want to cut it a livelihood that however, as part of it, they are not
2458180	2462880	allowed to promote past or present or future stuff.
2462880	2466980	So there is a huge Star Trek convention coming up, where there's going to be all these actors
2466980	2469660	there, they're not going to be able to talk about Star Trek.
2469660	2471620	So now what happens?
2471620	2476280	You're going to get all these very interesting panels that are like, talking to Star Trek
2476280	2478780	actors about philosophy.
2478780	2482020	And like, actually, but it actually could be really cool, because you're going to start
2482020	2487020	to see like, for example, Armin, dammit, I can't remember his name.
2487020	2488020	He played Cork.
2488020	2489020	Shimmerman, isn't it?
2489020	2490020	No.
2490020	2491020	Is it?
2491020	2492020	No.
2492020	2493020	Shimmerman.
2493020	2494020	Yes.
2494020	2495020	Yes.
2495020	2496020	Yes.
2496020	2497020	Yes.
2497020	2498020	Okay.
2498020	2499020	He is like a completely trained Shakespeare actor.
2499020	2503580	I remember this because on the on the cruise that we went on, he did a whole Shakespeare
2503580	2506100	class.
2506100	2509700	That's going to be the type of panels you're going to see at conventions.
2509700	2511380	Cork teaches Shakespeare.
2511380	2513740	No, they can't even say it's Cork.
2513740	2517140	They're just gonna have to say it's Armin Shimmerman doing Shakespeare because they
2517140	2520540	can't talk about projects past and present.
2520540	2521860	That's actually his name.
2521860	2522860	So yeah.
2522860	2523860	Hey.
2523860	2524860	Yeah.
2524860	2525860	No, no, it is.
2525860	2526860	It is.
2526860	2527860	But it's it's just gonna be very, very interesting.
2527860	2530100	And a lot of folks in chat are talking about San Diego Comic Con.
2530100	2531100	Can't do anything with that.
2531100	2537460	I believe Anson Mount, who wrote and pod culture, they can't talk about Buffy either.
2537460	2538460	I don't think that's what you meant.
2538460	2543500	But yeah, they wouldn't be able to talk about anything past or present.
2543500	2547180	Anson Mount, who of course, is on Strange New Worlds, who's going to be at the Star
2547180	2548180	Trek.
2548180	2551540	Well, they don't call it Star Trek because they don't have the naming rights.
2551540	2554540	I think they call it the 51 year voyage or something.
2554540	2556080	They call it something weird.
2556080	2558380	So he's supposed to be there.
2558380	2562660	He said that they are trying to work out like an interim agreement because essentially,
2562660	2567860	it's an independent con producer, so that they could essentially and they're not a part
2567860	2573120	of AMTPA, AMPTP.
2573120	2578740	So they're going to try to do an ad hoc agreement, essentially, to do that.
2578740	2581660	So I'll be very curious to see what happens with Dragon Con.
2581660	2585580	I hope the strike is resolved by Dragon Con, quite frankly, I would hate to see it because
2585580	2586740	that's like six weeks out.
2586740	2592020	I'd hate to see it go on that long, but we're gonna have some interesting fucking panels
2592020	2594140	if this doesn't get resolved.
2594340	2602620	As a panel host, I'm kind of scared like what am I going to have to do?
2602620	2606100	I think I'm okay because I do video gaming and again, video gaming is actually excluded
2606100	2607100	from this whole thing.
2607100	2608660	So we can still talk about video games.
2608660	2610860	So for the most part, I feel okay.
2610860	2615080	But I'm worried about other panel hosts and just that whole weird position that's going
2615080	2620260	to put everybody in where we can because then the other problem is you can't really do audience
2620260	2621260	questions.
2621260	2625780	I mean, you can try, but you can't really do audience questions because every time they
2625780	2629340	ask a question about a project, it's going to be, nope, can't do it.
2629340	2630340	Nope.
2630340	2631340	Can't do it.
2631340	2632340	Can't talk about that.
2632340	2633540	Can't talk about that.
2633540	2636740	So it's going to be interesting.
2636740	2638060	All right.
2638060	2643740	Let's move on and talk about another story, which is, again, is also make me Oh, yeah,
2643740	2644740	please.
2644740	2650780	Just one other thing about this, though, is that putting our voice actors and other actors
2650780	2656340	and positions that they can't speak about certain things, you know, their fans are going
2656340	2658180	to get pissed, right?
2658180	2661940	And hopefully direct that ire to the right source.
2661940	2662940	Right?
2662940	2663940	No, that's the point.
2663940	2664940	And that's essentially the point, right?
2664940	2665940	Yeah.
2665940	2666940	Yeah.
2666940	2669940	I just wanted to point that out just because it's something that people don't always think
2669940	2670940	about.
2670940	2671940	Yeah.
2671940	2674800	If we do end up doing these panels and there is a strike going on, it will probably every
2674800	2680360	strike will probably or every panel will probably open with due to the ongoing strike.
2680360	2683280	We are not allowed to talk about these projects today.
2683280	2684840	We would we would love to do this.
2684840	2689020	But until actors can be given a fair deal, we're not allowed to talk about this to bring
2689020	2690020	attention to this matter.
2690020	2693240	For more information, go to sag strike or whatever the website is.
2693240	2697400	Sorry, I don't know what I've taught my head by things like sag strike.org or something.
2697400	2698840	You know, go go there and learn more information.
2698840	2704300	Yeah, it's gonna be to try to get more awareness for social pressure to go on these companies.
2704300	2707560	Although I feel I feel like they're already winning that battle.
2707560	2711520	But there's a lot of people out there who are not in the know, I suppose, that aren't,
2711520	2715280	you know, on social media and things like that who are not in the know still, so we'll
2715280	2716280	see.
2716280	2718680	All right.
2718680	2723120	Let's talk about this story, which has to do with classic video games and the fact that
2723120	2727600	classic video games are kind of disappearing a little bit.
2727600	2735480	A recent study has come out that shows that 87% of classic video games are actually endangered.
2736440	2741280	This is a study that was done by the Video Game History Foundation.
2741280	2745440	They're out of production, they're unavailable in the current market, and so they're considered
2745440	2747240	critically endangered.
2747240	2753340	In this study, they do not consider emulation as something that's available in the current
2753340	2760420	market because the average person, quote unquote, does not have the technical prowess, we'll
2760420	2764680	say, I'm summarizing here, to go in and emulate games on their own.
2764680	2769100	And to be fair, you know, when we talk about emulation, no one's getting a cut of that.
2769100	2774220	We all know that that's why emulation is really a gray area, but we would want companies to
2774220	2777680	put their stuff out a little more openly.
2777680	2783720	So yeah, that's only 13% of gaming's overall history is actually readily available, so
2783720	2787000	to speak.
2787000	2791240	There's certain games you just can't play anymore unless you pirate them.
2791240	2792240	It's the way it is.
2792800	2796660	Especially a lot of like PC based games or, you know, games that got pulled off the market
2796660	2800540	a long time ago, something like Rule of Rose, if you will, because of its controversial
2800540	2802380	subject matter and so forth.
2802380	2809460	So now, obviously, collections come out sometimes like, you know, Konami has been doing a lot
2809460	2813300	of these lately with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collection, there was a Contra collection.
2813300	2817660	Hamsters Arcade Archives is pretty cool and has saved a lot of games, but we all know
2817660	2822100	that that's where the 13% comes from, but it's definitely not a lot.
2822100	2826380	Producers don't have a solution, nor do they often care about preservation.
2826380	2831480	So I think it's also coming to a call of like, we need an official way to preserve.
2831480	2835340	If we want to consider video games art, we need an official way to be able to preserve
2835340	2836340	this art.
2836340	2841520	And the Internet Archive lost a court case not that long ago about the sharing of ebooks.
2841520	2849400	So it makes the concern that we're not going to have a way to actually preserve these games.
2849400	2853020	If you want to learn more about it, you can actually visit the Video Game History Foundation
2853020	2858820	website, gamehistory.org, and they have a whole website set up about this, slash 87%.
2858820	2866020	Again, that's gamehistory.org, slash 87%, kind of all one word, 87%, all smushed together
2866020	2867020	there.
2867020	2869960	If you want to read more about this, and you can see more of the reports and you know how
2869960	2873580	things are not as available as they used to be.
2873580	2877840	This all being said, this is very interesting because you're going to see in our, as I was
2877840	2884360	putting together the outline for tonight's show, over half of our stories tonight involve
2884360	2888880	older projects returning, which is great news, I think.
2888880	2891300	But again, it's part of the 13%.
2891300	2894740	It's not part of the 87% in this.
2894740	2899160	There's a lot of games out there where the legal rights to who could even republish this
2899160	2903180	game if they wanted to have been in question for a while.
2903180	2907220	Dark Sakura, myself, and sometimes Loki, we talk until we're blue in the face about a
2907220	2911320	game called the Guardian Legend and how awesome it would be to see that released as some type
2911320	2912840	of official capacity.
2912840	2914880	But the rights are in a weird place right now.
2914880	2919160	I think we figured out who it is, but it's still like, it feels like a company that isn't
2919160	2922720	really in a hurry to put out retro catalog stuff.
2922720	2926360	We need a way to be able to preserve art like the Guardian Legend.
2926360	2930480	It's a damn shame that our kids can't really officially play that game unless we download
2930480	2932440	an emulator and do that whole thing.
2932440	2938860	So anyway, it's definitely something to read up more about and, you know, kind of get again,
2938860	2943820	sometimes it's about putting that voice and awareness out there so that we in turn put heat on
2943820	2949420	our elected officials to, you know, try to allow things like the Internet Archive to remain in
2949420	2954700	place or a library of gaming, if you will, which is kind of what the Video Game History
2954700	2956660	Foundation basically strives to be.
2956660	2960100	So it'd be very interesting to see where this goes.
2960100	2964200	So, well, speaking of history, DarkSakura.
2964200	2974360	Yeah, so one of the icons of the gaming industry, one Major Nelson is stepping down from Xbox.
2974360	2979880	I mean, who do we think of when we think of Xbox?
2979880	2987760	I mean, it's the man, you know, always been MasterChef.
2987760	2991140	But yeah, MasterChef.
2991140	3000100	But then again, I mean, he's been there for 20 years, and I think if he wants to step down, he should.
3000100	3004740	He said primarily he wants to spend more time with his family, and that's cool.
3004740	3009820	His statement is, after 20 incredible years, I have decided to take a step back and work on the
3009820	3012020	next chapter of my career.
3012020	3013740	Midna!
3013740	3014820	Sorry.
3014880	3020160	As I take a moment and think about all we have done together, I want to thank the millions of gamers
3020160	3023280	around the world who have included me as part of their lives.
3023280	3028560	Also, thanks to Xbox team members for trusting me to have a direct dialogue with our customers.
3028560	3033760	The future is bright for Xbox, and as a gamer, I am excited to see the evolution.
3033760	3035560	Thanks, and I'll see you online.
3035560	3036720	Yeah.
3036720	3042360	So he says he's going to take some time to spend with his family, enjoy the summer, and, you know,
3042360	3045320	just take some time off before he goes on to his other projects.
3045320	3046320	Yeah.
3046320	3048320	Good for him.
3048320	3050320	Yeah, he's been a great face of Xbox over the years.
3050320	3051320	He really has been, you know.
3051320	3057200	And, you know, in chat, Questbuster says Nintendo had Howard Phillips, and Xbox had Major Nelson.
3057200	3062380	Now, Major Nelson may not have been an executive at the company like a Howard Phillips, a Reggie Fils-Aime,
3062380	3065120	you know, or some of these faces we associate, you know, when we see the stage.
3065120	3070180	But Major Nelson did a great job of really, you know, supporting community in many ways.
3070180	3076080	And when the Xbox 360 was a big system, you know, it really started to bring us more digitally
3076080	3078680	delivered content through Xbox Arcade.
3078680	3082300	We also saw for a long time, a lot of his like gaming minutes and so forth were things
3082300	3086180	you could download on 360 or things you could watch through the 360 store.
3086180	3091780	It was really kind of before Sony and certainly Nintendo getting on that, you know, wave of
3091780	3098680	delivering a message directly to the consumers through the marketplace, which is, you know,
3098680	3100880	a big part of Major Nelson having handed that.
3100880	3105680	And as Jonah and Matt says, for the longest time, we said blank company needs a Major Nelson.
3105680	3106680	Truth.
3106680	3109680	The man did a lot for Xbox and gaming in general.
3109680	3112680	DJ Rama S says, I met Major Nelson when I worked at Microsoft.
3112680	3114680	He was there for the Halo Midnight release.
3114680	3118680	He gave my manager grief for ordering Domino's since he's from New York City.
3118680	3122680	As he should, as he should.
3122680	3126680	Bobby Blackwolf with an excellent point as well saying, Major Nelson was one of the very
3126680	3131680	early champions of gaming podcasting and legitimized us podcasters.
3131680	3132680	Truth.
3132680	3138680	I don't know how often we've talked out loud about this, but Microsoft more so than any
3138680	3140680	of their competitors.
3140680	3141680	I'm not saying the others didn't do this.
3141680	3147680	I'm just saying Microsoft more so than any of the others really embraced podcasting and
3147680	3154680	indie podcasters, quite frankly, from the get go and really, you know, I invited podcasters
3154680	3159680	from the early go to do some really exciting opportunity type of things.
3159680	3160680	You may or may not recall.
3160680	3165680	We here at Orange Orange Radio had a gamer pick of an official gamer pick on the Xbox
3165680	3166680	360 marketplace.
3166680	3168680	Sadly, it is no longer available.
3168680	3172680	I think it's actually one of those things where like the agreement that we signed actually,
3172680	3174680	I think, ended after so long.
3174680	3175680	I actually think that's what it is.
3175680	3177680	I think even we signed the thing that was only for like seven years.
3177680	3179680	There was a way to get those back, though.
3179680	3181680	They disappeared for a while then.
3181680	3183680	I remember there was a way like to get it back now.
3183680	3185680	Well, I never changed mine.
3185680	3186680	I never changed mine.
3186680	3188680	So technically, and I want to be technical.
3188680	3190680	Technically, it was an all games radio.
3190680	3196680	So before we were on VOG Network, we were on a network called All Games Radio and All
3196680	3199680	Games Radio put out a community pack or something like that.
3199680	3205680	It was a gamer pack because there was us and there was one other online radio community
3205680	3206680	at the time.
3206680	3211680	The name I don't recall in the moment because they've been disbanded for a while, but they
3211680	3215680	had the first pack and then we had the second pack and our picture was in that.
3215680	3221680	So Bobby says Gamertag Radio's community, but that was one of the shows in the other
3221680	3223680	community, but I can't remember the name of that community.
3223680	3229680	But it does obviously go to show how much Microsoft has really embraced.
3229680	3235680	Gamertag Radio obviously has done a lot with Microsoft over the years and had, if I remember
3235680	3239680	right, Phil Spencer went on their thousandth show that they did over there.
3239680	3244680	So that's how much Microsoft's really embraced the whole podcasting thing and that.
3244680	3246680	So it's great.
3246680	3248680	And Major Nelson, of course, a huge part of that.
3248680	3250680	So he will be missed.
3250680	3256680	But at the same time you go 20 years, that is an awful long time to be doing one job.
3256680	3260680	So you take it from us here at Orange Launch Radio, 20 years is a long time.
3260680	3262680	But this isn't the job we get paid for either.
3262680	3266680	So we do this because it's the quote unquote fun part.
3266680	3268680	Was that Gamerscore blog?
3268680	3269680	Was that it?
3269680	3273680	No, Gamerscore blog was the one that put the pictures out there.
3273680	3275680	I can't remember the name of the other network.
3275680	3276680	I'm such a jerk.
3276680	3277680	But again, it's been disbanded for years.
3277680	3281680	And I think Gamertag is the only show that was on it that still exists.
3281680	3283680	So, yeah.
3283680	3285680	Anyway.
3285680	3287680	Yeah, you have another one, right?
3287680	3288680	A little tidbit.
3288680	3295680	Just that I think is interesting, given that we've been bringing up classic games that
3295680	3299680	are, I guess, endangered.
3299680	3311680	Is that Sega is looking to, well, I mean, sort of looking to, but the president of Sega
3311680	3318680	and the chief operations officer, Sugino Yukio, was talking about reboots.
3318680	3323680	He, of course, did point fingers at Sonic the Hedgehog for rebooting.
3323680	3327680	But they also did bring up that there are some other games.
3327680	3333680	And so that the Samba de Amigo one is not a reboot, but a new game in the series.
3333680	3337680	And they want to look at some other games that go back to 2D.
3337680	3343680	But they're looking at their other IPs and thinking of ideas.
3343680	3351680	They want to do new things, but sometimes they can breathe new life into the old ones.
3352680	3357680	I mean, I would never see Sonic ever going away.
3357680	3361680	But I like the whole rebooting the classic types.
3361680	3363680	Because obviously we have the modern stuff.
3363680	3364680	Rangers.
3364680	3365680	Yeah.
3365680	3367680	So, all right.
3367680	3371680	And thank you, Bobby, finally scratching the itch of my memory in chat.
3371680	3373680	It was called Gamercast Network was the name of that network.
3373680	3374680	That's right.
3374680	3376680	Now that you said it, I'm like, oh, yeah, that was it.
3376680	3377680	I knew that the whole time.
3377680	3378680	No, I didn't.
3378680	3379680	I forgot.
3379680	3380680	OK.
3380680	3381680	All right.
3381680	3383680	Moving on, let's go to Loki.
3383680	3384680	Yeah.
3384680	3391680	So, because Media Molecule is going to be taking down support for Dreams September 1st
3391680	3397680	of this year, they've gone ahead and made some changes to their content policy that
3397680	3404680	it's going to allow for both commercial and personal purposes use of any player created
3404680	3408680	music, animations, films and art made in Dreams.
3408680	3414680	So, whereas you will not necessarily be able to, I think, share stuff through Dreams, you
3414680	3420680	will be able to develop stuff with Dreams to then export out to your own projects or
3420680	3422680	share on the Internet in other ways.
3422680	3424680	So, that's kind of neat that you can use it as a tool.
3424680	3429680	I don't know how easy, aside from like doing like screen captures for like animations and
3429680	3436680	stuff, you would be able to, you can't really export models or anything like that.
3437680	3439680	Neat.
3439680	3446680	I think the idea is fascinating in a way to, I realize this isn't exactly what they're
3446680	3447680	doing, but hear me out.
3447680	3452680	I think in a way it's a fascinating idea to take what they did with Dreams and really
3452680	3458680	encourage people to think of it as a game making platform similar to like a Unity or
3458680	3460680	a Unreal or something like that.
3461680	3467680	Or click fusion or one of those like box studio making things to help you in RPG maker.
3467680	3468680	I don't know.
3468680	3473680	Or just like create just content that you can use in other things.
3473680	3477680	So, like maybe artwork and stuff like that or you can make like little short films or
3477680	3484680	like kind of as a media software instead of a game now or something like that, which is
3484680	3485680	kind of neat.
3485680	3486680	Yeah.
3487680	3491680	I never did get around to playing this game, which is really a damn shame.
3491680	3493680	Did you ever play this, Loki?
3493680	3494680	I did not.
3494680	3496680	I just watched a lot of videos of people playing stuff.
3496680	3497680	In fact, I watched one.
3497680	3502680	It was, remember, I think we talked about a while ago where somebody recreated the T-Rex
3502680	3507680	scene from Jurassic Park in Dreams and they recreated the whole thing cinematically and
3507680	3508680	it looks pretty cool.
3508680	3510680	They expanded upon that now.
3510680	3515680	They're making a game in Dreams where basically a T-Rex is like walking around.
3515680	3521680	Kind of like how where they kind of teased and lost the world but never really fulfilled
3521680	3524680	with it, you know, whereas you have dinosaurs in the mainland.
3524680	3529680	I mean, I guess there's Jurassic World and stuff like that, but that's just silly and
3529680	3530680	stupid.
3530680	3535680	But what the original like thought was with that where it's kind of like almost like a
3535680	3539680	horror game type of thing where there's a T-Rex stalking you outside of your house type
3539680	3542680	of thing and you have to figure out what's going on.
3542680	3543680	So, it looked kind of cool.
3543680	3546680	I think Dreams and Media Molecule kind of got dealt a bad deal.
3546680	3547680	I mean, even I.
3547680	3549680	It was very abstract.
3549680	3554680	I follow video games a lot and even I kind of like this blipped on my radar, but it never
3554680	3559680	like cemented on my radar and I feel like Sony didn't push it enough compared to like
3559680	3560680	Little Big Planet or something.
3560680	3563680	Maybe it was because it was a harder to I don't know.
3563680	3566680	I just feel like Sony didn't push it as much as they should have.
3566680	3570680	But I guess it's easy to say that in retrospect about a lot of titles.
3570680	3571680	So.
3571680	3572680	All right.
3572680	3578680	Well, moving on to this next story, you know, we've been talking about retro games that
3578680	3581680	are disappearing and so forth.
3581680	3588680	But man, if you want to talk about a retro game, like Criterion Collection type of way
3588680	3591680	of preserving it, this looks really stunning.
3591680	3598680	So, Digital Eclipse has actually announced this game that is the making of.
3598680	3603680	I always called this game Karateka, but I think it's actually Karateka is what it's
3603680	3604680	supposed to be.
3604680	3607680	But I always say karate because, you know, it's in the Karateka.
3607680	3610680	But anyway, there's many ways to pronounce this.
3610680	3612680	Digital Eclipse has announced the making of this.
3612680	3614680	It is a gold master series.
3614680	3619680	Basically, this game looks like it is made in the Atari 50 engine, which really wasn't
3619680	3620680	bad at all.
3620680	3625680	It has a similar type of timeline and all of these clips that you can see in the trailer
3625680	3627680	that's playing live on Twitch.
3627680	3633680	But even if you're listening on the podcast feed, you just see lots of concept art, photographs,
3633680	3635680	prototypes, different versions of the game.
3635680	3640680	So, you know, because again, games that came out back then went on like 20 different platforms.
3640680	3645680	So, there's actually going to be like four different versions of the game that will be
3645680	3648680	available like Commodore 64, Apple 2.
3648680	3650680	There's going to be a prototype available of the game.
3650680	3651680	This is awesome.
3651680	3656680	So, the editorial director of Digital Eclipse, Chris Koehler, said our mission with the gold
3656680	3661680	master series is to elevate these games, presenting them in the best possible light while putting
3661680	3667680	them in their proper historical context, an approach we've dubbed the interactive documentary.
3667680	3671680	So, again, if you've played Atari 50, you know what this is essentially going to look
3671680	3672680	like.
3672680	3676680	And there's a whole new remastered version as well that looks pretty good.
3676680	3679680	Like the remasters that were in the Atari 50 collection.
3679680	3683680	I didn't like the games so much that they like rebooted.
3683680	3687680	Like they did like a haunted house thing that was very meh to me.
3687680	3694680	But in that collection, they put like a Yars revenge that was just basically the Atari
3694680	3695680	2600 version of Yars revenge.
3695680	3700680	But like with modern, like not even modern graphics, like it just like put a modern effect
3700680	3703680	kind of on the graphics that made it look very new and stuff.
3703680	3705680	And that's what you kind of saw going on with Karateka.
3705680	3707680	And that I think it looks really cool.
3707680	3713680	I think for me, this is all about price because I don't think you could charge 70 bucks for
3713680	3714680	this.
3714680	3716680	In fact, it might be hard to charge a lot.
3716680	3721680	But man, if they release this at the right price, I hope people buy it and eat this up
3721680	3727680	because this is the way to I mean, this is preservation in every sense of the word.
3727680	3733680	By the way, if you don't know Karateka, it was an older PC game and it kind of the same
3733680	3735680	creator ended up making Prince of Persia.
3735680	3741680	So that whole movement and what went into those sprites early on, like it was really
3741680	3746680	unheard of the amount of fluidity that went into the sprite and the old art direction
3746680	3747680	in those games.
3747680	3751680	That's why, you know, because you may be sitting there going, I've never heard of Karateka.
3751680	3756680	But it was it did new things for art and it did new things for, you know, like a game
3756680	3758680	that wasn't really a loop.
3758680	3761680	It was a game that you move through like a story.
3761680	3764680	It's not the first one that ever existed, but it's first one that really did it.
3764680	3766680	At this type of level.
3766680	3768680	It's really, really cool.
3768680	3773680	Bobby points out that Karateka was the first game that had humans in cut scenes.
3773680	3774680	Oh, good point.
3774680	3778680	Because, you know, Pac-Man had Pac people and ghosts, but not humans.
3778680	3779680	Well, it's very interesting.
3779680	3781680	So, hmm.
3781680	3784680	Dark to see you in chat says, I'm actually kind of excited.
3784680	3787680	I was never super good at Karateka, but I did play it.
3787680	3791680	Wouldn't be opposed to owning a definitive criterion style version of it.
3791680	3796680	Questbuster in chat says the rotoscoping techniques used in this were so groundbreaking at the time.
3796680	3801680	So seriously, even if you've never heard of Karateka, I feel like this is the type of game where it's like,
3801680	3804680	you can learn something about the gaming industry.
3804680	3809680	This is this is any YouTuber that wants to comment on the industry should be required
3809680	3813680	to play a game like this and understand what all goes into it.
3813680	3816680	So and I'm happy to play it and educate myself as well.
3816680	3817680	I think it's it's cool.
3817680	3822680	I I hope it is successful and I hope they're encouraged to do this with more old school games for sure.
3822680	3826680	Because, yeah, Atari 50 is really not a bad collection at all.
3826680	3829680	It's quite good considering the Atari collections over the years.
3829680	3838680	So Bobby Black Wolf in chat says this is kind of like watching Casablanca and then being like, wow, this shit is so derivative.
3838680	3842680	And then you realize that Casablanca is what defined the tropes.
3842680	3843680	Yes.
3843680	3847680	Yes. Bury that. Bury that.
3847680	3851680	All right. Let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3851680	3863680	Anyway, they have Atari has gone with Dreams Incorporated to do an adaptation of Lunar Lander called Lunar Lander Beyond.
3863680	3875680	Should be out this year for PC and console, but it's adding some simulation and narrative to the game and some precision mechanics added on in.
3875680	3889680	You basically are the appointed the newest captain of the Pegasus Corporation and you have to guide your crew through these various areas with very demanding missions.
3889680	3893680	You go in space and deliver cargo and do all kinds of stuff like that.
3893680	3905680	And and it also looks so there's a conflicting information here said that it's supposed to be in the first half of twenty twenty four for Switch.
3905680	3910680	So anyway, yeah, cool game.
3910680	3914680	I'm actually I like the art direction and I think that it looks really neat.
3914680	3916680	Yeah. And I remember the old school.
3916680	3917680	Very vibrant.
3917680	3918680	Is so difficult.
3918680	3919680	And kind of toonie.
3919680	3921680	Yeah.
3921680	3928680	Hopefully adding the narrative element to it will breathe new life into it.
3928680	3929680	All right.
3929680	3930680	That's it.
3930680	3932680	Loki.
3932680	3934680	All right. So this is great news.
3934680	3945680	If you are looking to play some emulators on the Xbox series S or X, you may remember they had this available before the UWP folks were either.
3945680	3950680	Well, actually, even before that, they did they were loading them in through the dev mode.
3950680	3956680	If you paid like 20 bucks to Microsoft, you can get your console unlocked to be a developer console.
3956680	3961680	And then they would just take developer versions of those emulators and run them on there.
3961680	3976680	That got shut down. And then, of course, there was a workaround that allowed you to do it without having your console in developer mode, basically downloading a specific UWP app through the Web browser.
3976680	3990680	And now they're back doing the same thing again, except they're trying to hide it a little bit better with the package, disguising in a way that you won't necessarily won't be as caught as quickly by Microsoft.
3990680	3996680	So the hacker group UWeapons has basically figured out a way to do this.
3996680	4004680	They have a way you basically sign up to their Patreon and you're given the link to go download the app.
4004680	4006680	And they have different emulators in there.
4006680	4015680	I think it was the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Dreamcast are in there.
4015680	4020680	And yeah, it looked like it was running pretty well.
4020680	4028680	I just I don't play on my console enough to bother trying this out, but it looked cool.
4028680	4032680	You can play, you know, Wii games on there, boot up some Excite truck again.
4032680	4036680	But yeah, pretty cool looking thing.
4036680	4039680	I wonder how quickly they will catch and patch this out.
4039680	4043680	Probably not too long.
4046680	4048680	Yeah, probably not too long before they do that.
4048680	4057680	But even if they do patch it out or this is too difficult for you to follow, we now have an official way to enjoy retro games on the Xbox.
4057680	4061680	And let me tell you, my jaw hit the floor when I heard this news this week.
4061680	4062680	You know why?
4062680	4068680	Because on last week's show here on OLR, this is not this is not a Rob Stradamus thing.
4068680	4070680	This is a chat Stradamus thing.
4070680	4076680	Out of the blue, SG100 Matt, I think it was, asked us about Antstream or brought up the topic of Antstream.
4076680	4084680	The, of course, you know, cloud based gaming system that rolled out a few years ago at this point.
4084680	4089680	I think it was just before the pandemic had rolled out and it was on Xbox One.
4089680	4093680	And I remember saying, God, I wish they would have brought that out for Series S or X.
4093680	4096680	I would have loved to have played that and continue doing that on Xbox.
4096680	4099680	But I ended up letting my subscription lapse, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4099680	4101680	Well, somebody was fucking listening.
4101680	4104680	Let me tell you, because this week the news came out.
4104680	4112680	Antstream Arcade has announced they will be coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S later this month.
4112680	4120680	And games that were previously only playable on Sony or Nintendo platforms will become playable on Xbox through its service.
4120680	4124680	I do want to say, I think that's a cute little tagline.
4124680	4132680	It isn't the first time that Sony and Nintendo games have been playable on maybe I don't even know.
4132680	4135680	I don't know if they're talking first party because I don't think anything first party is on the service.
4135680	4137680	I don't see Nintendo ever licensing that.
4137680	4140680	But maybe, maybe Donkey Kong arcade or something.
4140680	4147680	I don't know. But my point is, the Rare Replay had Cobra Triangle in it, an NES game, among other games.
4147680	4149680	I'm just doing the ones I remember.
4149680	4158680	And then of course, all these Konami collections over the years actually do have NES games and PlayStation games even in the case of Castlevania.
4158680	4160680	You know, and Subcontra is in them.
4160680	4163680	So it's technically not the first time they're playable.
4163680	4170680	But okay, you know what, there are certain picks in here that are going to be playable for the first time.
4170680	4172680	Sure, of course, we'll give them that.
4172680	4177680	Anyway, retro titles that go all the way back to the Commodore era.
4177680	4180680	You can play games because it's through the clouds.
4180680	4182680	You don't really install anything except the player.
4182680	4185680	They've been adding more and more retro titles through time.
4185680	4195680	And of course, this is already available on PC, Mac, Linux, Android, Android TV, Fire Stick, Samsung, and the web browser.
4195680	4200680	Funny enough, this press release neglected the Atari VCS. Oh, well.
4200680	4205680	And stream arcade is coming out for $30 later this month, a year.
4205680	4211680	You pay for $30 a year or if you want lifetime access, 80 bucks.
4211680	4213680	So could be interesting.
4213680	4217680	It's not bad. I mean, if you're really into retro games, that's not a bad price.
4217680	4220680	If you're really into retro games, it's not a bad price at all, to be honest.
4220680	4222680	And the collection was pretty decent.
4222680	4226680	I mean, I let my service run out some time ago, and it's only gotten better since then.
4226680	4231680	Like, I don't remember things like Ninja Gaiden, Mortal Kombat, Spy Hunter.
4231680	4232680	I don't remember these games being on the service.
4232680	4235680	But you know I love me some Commodore 64.
4235680	4239680	And there were some really great games that were on the service from the Commodore 64 era.
4239680	4241680	So I think it's worth a look, if nothing else.
4241680	4245680	I think they have a monthly version too.
4245680	4252680	But yeah, the service will be available in Europe, the UK, USA, Canada, and Vatican City.
4252680	4259680	So sadly, I'm not seeing Mexico or Australia or some of the other places I know we have listeners at in this yet.
4259680	4261680	But cross your fingers and your toes.
4261680	4263680	Do you have any listeners in the Vatican?
4263680	4265680	Yeah, I don't think we have any. Just one.
4265680	4267680	I don't think we have any listeners in the Vatican.
4267680	4272680	It's like some assistant to some bishop who works for the Pope.
4272680	4273680	Yeah, yeah, right.
4273680	4274680	He loves video games.
4274680	4275680	Yeah.
4275680	4284680	But I wonder, so of course Deft is in chat saying, boo, I wonder if you can't create a US account and get the service that way.
4284680	4285680	VPM.
4285680	4291680	Yeah, because I'm sure you all are already familiar with that process from some other companies.
4291680	4292680	So anyway.
4293680	4298680	And they said, well, there's a thing on here, which I don't know, we don't talk about preordering very much.
4298680	4306680	But like they said, if you preorder it and stream arcade on Xbox, one in 10 will get upgraded to a lifetime pass edition for free.
4306680	4307680	Fine.
4307680	4308680	All right, cool.
4308680	4309680	I hope it's for free.
4309680	4310680	Doesn't specify for free.
4310680	4316680	We're just going to randomly charge some of you guys a little bit more than you wanted.
4316680	4318680	I hope you don't mind.
4318680	4319680	That would be funny.
4319680	4328680	All right, well, for our next segment, I don't think this game is on Antstream, but it's still worth a trip down memory lane nonetheless.
4328680	4330680	Let's roll the bumper.
4340680	4348680	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4348680	4351680	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4351680	4354680	And what did you pick Dark Sakura?
4354680	4362680	I picked Parasite Eve, another game I thought I had done, but apparently not.
4362680	4368680	Parasite Eve came out in 1988, and it's a role play game that was published by Square.
4368680	4374680	It's actually a sequel to the novel Parasite Eve, which I've actually started reading.
4374680	4381680	The novel is written by Sena Hideaki, and this was the first game of the video series.
4381680	4395680	It follows a police officer named Aya Brea over a six-day span in 1997 to stop Eve, who is a woman who plans to destroy humanity through spontaneous human combustion.
4395680	4397680	That's kind of cool.
4397680	4399680	I mean, what a way to go, right?
4399680	4402680	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
4402680	4414680	This is Square's first M-rated game, and the first major American-Japanese game development collaboration.
4414680	4421680	It was produced by Sakaguchi Hironobu, and directed by Tokida Takashi.
4421680	4429680	And the music, of course notable, one of my favorite game music people of all time, Shinomura Yoko,
4429680	4437680	who was tasked with doing an inorganic and emotionless soundtrack, and actually had two album releases.
4437680	4444680	It was considered overall very positive, though some people considered it to be too linear.
4445680	4461680	At any rate, the game was actually part of a bigger thing in Japan where different horror was being sort of re-sparked in the public eye.
4461680	4473680	And so the book actually ended up being re-released and had a film adaptation and two manga, one based on the book and the other one based on the game.
4473680	4482680	And then there were two sequels to the game, Parasite Eve 2 in 1999 and The Third Birthday in 2010.
4482680	4489680	Also, the game was re-released on PSN in 2010.
4489680	4497680	And basically the first two games have shipped over three million copies by 2010 worldwide.
4497680	4501680	So this was...
4501680	4510680	There were other games that Square was releasing at the time that had some very experimental type of combat systems.
4510680	4517680	You know, for their mechanics like Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil, they were kind of going along with some of that.
4517680	4525680	And this was considered to be a cinematic RPG, so it was trying to evoke like a movie experience.
4526680	4534680	So you can only move around to specific destinations in the game on this world map, which is basically a map of Manhattan.
4534680	4539680	And then you get, like on a hotspot, you get a random encounter.
4539680	4548680	So they materialize and attack you on the screen you're running around on, so like no battle mode or special thing.
4548680	4556680	And then in the game you have an active time bar that basically it has to go through a cycle before you can take your turn.
4556680	4563680	But you can move around to dodge attacks during your waiting period.
4563680	4570680	And then you can choose to attack, so the battle pauses so you can do your thing.
4570680	4575680	Or you can not attack.
4575680	4586680	So you also have a tune-up option that when you choose a weapon that can be altered and attribute certain things to it.
4586680	4591680	And then of course you gain levels as you go through it.
4591680	4596680	When you beat the game you do have a new game plus mode that's called EX Game.
4596680	4601680	You have every item stored in the police station.
4601680	4606680	You begin with the final weapon and armor, the stuff you chose before ending the game.
4606680	4609680	But you go back to being level one.
4609680	4616680	But the bonus points that you got at the end of the game are now available for you to use.
4616680	4621680	Items, weapons, power-ups, enemies, everything is more powerful.
4622680	4641680	And a big difference is that you can now go through the Chrysler building that has 77 randomized floors that leads to a final boss battle with, I would reckon, the true enemy of the game.
4641680	4646680	Which is, spoilers, Aya's older sister, Maya.
4646680	4656680	So the game starts off at Carnegie Hall and I have to say the first time I saw this I was like, the shit is happening.
4656680	4666680	So Aya is an NYPD rookie. You go to Carnegie Hall with a blind date for Christmas Eve 1997.
4666680	4675680	And during the opera everyone spontaneously combusts, except for Aya, her date and an actress on stage named Melissa Pierce.
4676680	4686680	And Aya goes to confront her and Melissa talks about Aya's mitochondria because mitochondria comes up in this game because people don't know how mitochondria work in the real world.
4686680	4693680	And then she turns into a critter, runs into the sewers, and now calls herself Eve.
4693680	4697680	That's the start of the game. If you went into the rest of it, you can play it yourself.
4698680	4702680	But it is based off of the novel that was released in 1995.
4702680	4707680	And it is considered a sequel to the book.
4707680	4725680	In fact, it even references events in the book that refer back to Anzai Mariko, who was the main woman in the book that Eve had chosen to become her host in the novel, being Aya's mother.
4726680	4736680	So yeah, that's why I want to go back and read the book because I didn't at the time and I have some love of the genre.
4736680	4745680	Aya was created by Sakaguchi Hironobu, but designed by Nomura Tetsuya. We all know Nomura.
4746680	4757680	And she was originally designed by someone else, but the sketches didn't make Sakaguchi happy and he wanted someone with long hair that was a lot more like Aerith.
4759680	4771680	And so Nomura had done some drawings and was working on another character sketch and got them mixed up. So it gave her, you know, shorter hair.
4771680	4780680	The original concept was her to be strong, sexy, and be witching. And she was named for Sakaguchi's daughter, Aya.
4780680	4787680	But at any rate, due to the mix-up though, we liked the design and that's what stuck.
4787680	4792680	It was released on March 29th, 1998 in Japan for PlayStation.
4792680	4804680	It had full motion video ads and the game was, the same commercials were aired in the US prior to its release.
4804680	4812680	But there was a shipping issue with 200 copies of the game shipped to Best Buy a week before release.
4812680	4823680	It was the first game to be rated mature by the ESRB and the first released under Square Electronic Arts as a joint venture.
4823680	4827680	And it came out in North America September 9th, 1998.
4827680	4839680	Before the third birthday came out in 2010, Kitase Yoshinori and Nomura Tetsuya were talking about a re-release of Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve 2.
4839680	4846680	But it was held up due to rights because it was co-owned with Sena Hideaki, the author.
4846680	4851680	But it did get a re-release in Japan and North America on PlayStation Network.
4851680	4855680	And it was included in the Japanese lineup of PlayStation Classic.
4855680	4863680	So like I said, music was done by Shinomura Yoko, including the main theme called Primal Eyes.
4864680	4872680	And then there's a vocal song, Somnia Memorius, that was performed by Shani Rigsby.
4872680	4879680	The album being a combination of opera and electronica really, really took off.
4879680	4883680	I mean, she's an amazing composer regardless.
4884680	4893680	And of course, she went on to do Kingdom Hearts and music on Super Mario RPG.
4893680	4896680	But it's considered that Parasite Eve is her breakout piece.
4900680	4907680	And it was also the first of her projects that had vocal themes in it, had a vocal ending theme.
4907680	4910680	So she designed all of that too.
4910680	4915680	And the lyrics for all the vocal pieces were written by Shinomura.
4915680	4919680	And there was a track called I Hear a Voice Asking Me to Awaken.
4919680	4924680	It's actually an arrangement of a Bach piece.
4926680	4929680	I'm going to mispronounce this because I'm not very good with German.
4929680	4940680	But anyway, the soundtrack was released through DigiCube May 21st, 1998.
4940680	4943680	And it was reprinted through Square.
4943680	4952680	And basically, I mean, there's also a Parasite Eve remix 10-track album that had...
4952680	4955680	And some of these names might actually sound familiar, Rob.
4955680	4970680	There was remixes by Tomo Quadra, Dan Kay, Tribal Masters, Kei Nakayama, and Dummy Run.
4970680	4976680	And yeah, major awesome soundtrack.
4976680	4979680	The game was, like I said, very well received.
4980680	4987680	Its rating with Famitsu was 33 out of 40, which is pretty good.
4987680	4991680	Because Famitsu has a track record of being Hard as Balls.
4991680	4995680	Sorry, I'm losing my voice.
4995680	5005680	The game was compared to Resident Evil series, but that Parasite Eve has deeper gameplay and more hidden areas to discover.
5005680	5017680	But the combat was compared a bit more to Final Fantasy VII, where the dynamic camera made things a little bit hard to navigate.
5017680	5025680	However, the author of the book approved of the game and said that he was actually impressed with how well the game makers translated the novel.
5025680	5034680	It was nominated by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences as a finalist for console game of the year.
5034680	5042680	Console action game of the year, and console role-playing game of the year during the second annual Interactive Achievement Awards.
5042680	5050680	It was ranked in 2016 by Hamitsu readers as one of the top 100 PlayStation games of all time.
5050680	5052680	Pretty high up.
5052680	5056680	And yeah, even to this day, it still gets positive reviews.
5057680	5068680	So, Parasite Eve was actually an inspiration for other items that came out in the Jehora phenomenon.
5068680	5075680	Including the books for The Ring, which is Ring, Spiral, and Loop.
5075680	5079680	And two video game sequels and a manga adaptation.
5079680	5086680	And it's based on the video game universe called Parasite Eve Diva.
5086680	5091680	And there you go. That's the game.
5091680	5096680	Parasite Eve. I'm gonna admit, this is one I kind of missed.
5096680	5099680	I think I played it briefly, like a friend of mine had it.
5099680	5104680	But I wasn't super into it for some reason.
5104680	5107680	And I think this is where I was at in my life at the time.
5107680	5111680	And Rob Roberts in 1998 was very different.
5111680	5114680	I didn't enjoy playing it. I enjoyed watching it.
5114680	5120680	Yeah, I think that's it. I wasn't a fan of the game mechanic side of things.
5120680	5128680	But again, how many games have I played where maybe I felt one way about it 25 years ago.
5128680	5132680	And I'll probably feel different about it now if I were to go back and play it again.
5132680	5138680	I did finish it. I don't remember much about it though, other than it being weird.
5138680	5144680	I wanted to play the third birthday though, because I heard that that was really awesome.
5144680	5149680	ZenMonkey11 in chat says, I remember the ads for this game. The good old days. Yeah.
5149680	5154680	Pelehanumeya says, wasn't there a Parasite Eve 2? Yeah, it's the third birthday.
5154680	5158680	I mentioned it. No, no, no. The third birthday was not Parasite Evil 2.
5158680	5161680	It was Parasite Evil 2 and then the third birthday.
5161680	5164680	Yes, sorry, because obviously it's three.
5164680	5169680	Questbuster in chat says, I know it's wishful thinking, but I hope they release all three games as part of a collection.
5169680	5179680	You never know. We did just have that story or that talk about how Square Enix was relatively pleased with the Final Fantasy pixel collection and how that went over.
5179680	5184680	And that could lead to more. Now, obviously, this isn't a pixel game. So maybe it's from the wrong.
5184680	5190680	But it's still I think it's showing Square Enix. There is big interest in the back catalog. Absolutely.
5190680	5196680	So, yeah, they'll just bring it back as an action game and then it'll be like Bayonetta.
5196680	5199680	OK, but where's the problem?
5199680	5201680	It's not the same.
5201680	5205680	You said one of my favorite games. I love Bayonetta.
5205680	5211680	So it was just, yeah, they got to do it right, obviously, if they if they were to modernize it or what have you.
5211680	5215680	All right. Great pick. Parasite Eve, classic game of the week.
5215680	5222680	I'm myself as well surprised not in the last 700 episodes that we talked about that game.
5222680	5229680	All right. Moving on to some rapid fire news, some other headlines from the gaming world. Loki.
5229680	5232680	Yep. This is kind of interesting.
5232680	5240680	It's a it's a little mod for Half-Life 2 that turns it into a Lego Half-Life 2 game.
5240680	5243680	It's silly. Show this to Alan. He loves Half-Life.
5243680	5246680	Yeah. Not everything is necessarily Lego in it.
5246680	5254680	It's kind of just taking the main like main playable characters in the game and switch them out for Lego characters.
5254680	5257680	But I mean, it looks pretty legit.
5257680	5262680	I mean, if they just did like all the background stuff as well as Lego, that could be really cool.
5262680	5266680	Maybe perhaps that could come later on. I mean, after all, it is it is a mod.
5266680	5268680	You could just redo all the assets for it.
5268680	5272680	But yeah, it it looks looks like a Lego game.
5272680	5278680	And if you have Half-Life, then, you know, it's pretty much for I think any actually.
5278680	5283680	Yeah, I think Half-Life 2 and you can download it for free. So check it out.
5283680	5290680	And then we had kind of a slip maybe or something that's not been officially announced yet,
5290680	5297680	but it's been confirmed on the I believe it was TikTok or Instagram.
5297680	5304680	No, TikTok. They had a trailer that they did for the boys.
5304680	5308680	For their integration with Call of Duty, which apparently is all sorts of broken.
5308680	5317680	But with that, someone said moral combat win and then the actual account for it's Vought International,
5317680	5326680	which is like the fictional company that basically runs all of the seven, which is the superhero group that's evil in the boys.
5326680	5330680	And they said, you know, confirmed basically, you know.
5330680	5334680	So I guess we'll have to wait and see.
5334680	5339680	Homelander for a playable character in Mortal Kombat would be pretty crazy.
5339680	5341680	I mean, it makes a lot of sense.
5341680	5343680	It absolutely makes a lot of sense.
5343680	5347680	Consider that we've been getting a lot more licensed characters in Mortal Kombat games lately.
5347680	5348680	It's yeah, makes sense.
5348680	5351680	I can see it in the perfect. Yeah.
5351680	5352680	All right.
5352680	5358680	All right, Dar Sakura.
5358680	5363680	You're muted on Discord. I see the little mute icon.
5363680	5367680	You know, I would see that if I was actually looking at it.
5367680	5374680	There are some updates for PlayStation Plus's game catalog for July.
5374680	5377680	Excuse me. We will see.
5377680	5386680	It takes two. The Ascent, Undertale, Twisted Metal one and two.
5386680	5397680	Circus Electric, Dynasty Warriors nine, Dismantle, Fast and Furious, Spy Racers, Rise of the Shifter, whatever.
5397680	5401680	Melty Blood, Type Lumina.
5401680	5406680	Just a bunch of others. And then, of course, a My Little Pony game, but there are still bronies in the universe.
5406680	5413680	Sniper Elite 5, World Wars Ed. So there you go.
5413680	5417680	Gravity Crash Portable is also on the list.
5417680	5422680	We've had more and more gaming companies throughout the industry that are unionizing.
5422680	5427680	And now the latest and greatest to join them is Sega of America.
5427680	5433680	That's right. Sega of America voted ninety one twenty six in favor of their unit.
5433680	5436680	The Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega or Aegis.
5436680	5442680	I think we've heard this on the show before, because I remember making a joke that that was an item in Ingress.
5442680	5448680	Well, it just means shield. Yeah. Nineteen ballots were challenged, but three of them were avoided.
5448680	5454680	But whatever. However, they got there, they are now officially organized for the Communications Workers of America.
5454680	5463680	The unit is more than 200 workers in different departments throughout Sega, brand marketing, games service, marketing services, localization, sales and quality assurance product development.
5463680	5473680	It's not the first games unit in North America, but it is the largest multi department union of organized workers in the entire gaming industry.
5473680	5480680	But ZeniMax Workers United was around 300 quality assurance workers. But of course, that is one department.
5480680	5487680	Still, however you slice it, however it breaks the record books, pretty cool to see. Certainly won't be the last. That's for sure.
5487680	5495680	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out to a store near you starting in the U.S., Loki.
5495680	5499680	Yeah. This week we have Ember Nights on Nintendo Switch.
5499680	5506680	Lisa, the Definitive Edition on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

5558680	5562680	Ninja Savior's Return of the Warriors on PC.
5562680	5567680	I completely forgot that this is coming out, but finally it can stop seeing the stupid Nintendo...
5567680	5570680	Well, I say that, but then they're going to show it for DLC and stuff.
5570680	5573680	Pikmin 4 on Nintendo Switch this week.
5573680	5580680	And then finally, Stephanie on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
5583680	5585680	We'll never be rid of Pikmin 4.
5588680	5590680	Pikmin, aren't they good in barbecue?
5591680	5592680	Rob, you're muted.
5593680	5597680	Sorry about that. Gosh, it's a plague that's spreading, isn't it?
5597680	5601680	So anyway, Pikmin is also available in Japan this week.
5601680	5604680	If we want to start off with that, Pikmin 4.
5604680	5606680	Some other games that are coming out on the Switch this week.
5606680	5608680	We have Cross Tales coming out on the Switch.
5608680	5613680	Zero Fire, Toaplan Arcade Garage is out this week.
5613680	5614680	Nice.
5614680	5615680	Toaplan Shooters.
5615680	5618680	No, I know, but I was like, oh, it's Zero Wing and Hellfire.
5618680	5621680	It's that long awaited Zero Wing re-release that's coming out.
5622680	5630680	Nobunaga Ambition Rebirth with a power-up kit in a regular and a limited edition is out this week in Japan as well.
5630680	5634680	Moto, not that, that gets into something else.
5634680	5644680	How about an amiibo for Pyra and Mythra is coming out for Super Smash Brothers amiibo this week in Japan as well.
5644680	5647680	Taking a look at the PlayStation 5 to look at releases there.
5647680	5651680	Evil West is out as well as Cross Tales in Japan this week.
5651680	5654680	Both of those on the 20th.
5654680	5655680	Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.
5656680	5661680	On the 18th, we have Cuphead and Super Smash Bros.
5661680	5666680	On the 18th, we have Cuphead Limited Edition for PlayStation and Switch.
5666680	5671680	Also on the 18th, T'Chaya Oleiti Edition.
5671680	5673680	That's on PlayStation.
5673680	5679680	On the 20th, for looks like PC, we have Sims 4, a Horseranch expansion.
5679680	5680680	Yay.
5680680	5683680	On the 21st, for Switch, Pikmin 4.
5684680	5686680	And that's it.
5687680	5688680	All right.
5688680	5694680	We still have some more news coming at you, including more really cool retro releases.
5694680	5696680	In fact, there's quite a few of these here, right, Loki?
5696680	5697680	Yes, there's a lot.
5697680	5705680	So I'm going to try to go over them pretty quick, but they had the Limited Run Games 3 2023.
5705680	5709680	Their Limited Run Saves E3 Summer Games Showcase.
5709680	5710680	It's a very long title.
5710680	5715680	But they were basically talking about a bunch of different titles coming out.
5715680	5719680	They made it look like a retro E3, which I thought was kind of funny.
5720680	5724680	So the games announced and I'm going to try to be really quick with this.
5724680	5726680	The Castlevania Advanced Collection.
5726680	5729680	So it's all the Game Boy Advance and I think DS games as well.
5729680	5731680	And there's like four titles in there.
5731680	5734680	So that's coming out here actually at the end of the month.
5734680	5739680	Rise of the Triad Ludicrous Edition is getting a physical release.
5739680	5743680	Komaju Remilia Scarlet Symphony.
5743680	5745680	Tiger Heli.
5745680	5749680	And we had Kara Tekka.
5749680	5751680	The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles soundtracks.
5751680	5754680	The games are actually, the soundtracks are coming out in vinyl.
5754680	5760680	And I think even like a cassette tape, which is kind of weird.
5760680	5763680	Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition.
5763680	5767680	El Shaddai Essentials of the Metatron was coming to the consoles.
5767680	5770680	I think actually that's to the Switch.
5770680	5773680	And then Dungeons of Aether.
5773680	5780680	We have the Shantae Adverse Risky Revolution or Advanced Risky Revolution.
5780680	5783680	And that's coming out of the consoles as well.
5783680	5787680	Some of the more stranger things that are coming out,
5787680	5789680	that they kind of finished up with.
5789680	5793680	The Gex Trilogy is coming to the consoles.
5793680	5795680	Some of these actually, these last four.
5795680	5800680	So the Gex Trilogy, Tomba, the Jurassic Park Elastic Games Collection.
5800680	5801680	I'm sorry, people are really excited about Tomba.
5801680	5803680	That is like out of nowhere, honestly.
5803680	5804680	That's great.
5804680	5807680	Yeah, so that one and Clock Tower.
5807680	5810680	Those are all coming thanks to the Carbon Engine,
5810680	5815680	which Modern Vintage Gaming has actually been working to develop.
5815680	5820680	So it's like some engine that's going to allow them to port games a little bit easier.
5820680	5822680	So it's kind of neat.
5822680	5826680	The original Clock Tower has been on my list for Super Famicom.
5826680	5828680	Yeah, it's really cool.
5828680	5829680	They've got a lot of things.
5829680	5832680	Disney's Gargoyles Remastered.
5832680	5834680	That's out of nowhere.
5834680	5836680	That's kind of strange.
5836680	5841680	We have Plumbers Don't Wear Ties Definitive Edition.
5841680	5844680	That's pretty funny.
5844680	5846680	Midnight Fright Express.
5846680	5847680	Colossal Cave.
5847680	5849680	Another Crusade.
5849680	5851680	Rose and Camelia Collection.
5851680	5853680	Double Shake.
5853680	5855680	Chicory.
5855680	5858680	Odinkat's Paradise Collection.
5858680	5863680	Arzette the Jeweled Faramore, I guess.
5863680	5866680	And This Way Madness Lies.
5866680	5873680	So lots of obscure games and older games being brought back and remastered.
5873680	5876680	There's even, I think, Clock Tower is one.
5876680	5879680	I think that they have actually new games coming from that as well
5879680	5886680	and being worked on by, oh, gosh, I can't remember the name now, the studio.
5886680	5892680	It was WayForward is doing a new Clock Tower game.
5892680	5895680	So pretty awesome.
5895680	5897680	It's going to be scary.
5897680	5900680	Those games are pretty intense from what I remember.
5900680	5901680	Yeah.
5901680	5902680	All right.
5902680	5906680	Well, some folks in chat are talking about if that Castlevania collection already had a physical release.
5906680	5907680	I thought it was digital only.
5907680	5909680	I didn't realize it had a physical release before.
5909680	5913680	I thought they only offered that on the digital front.
5913680	5916680	I know it's been out, but I didn't know it was a physical release.
5916680	5922680	But again, I don't go shopping very often for games physically.
5922680	5928680	I bought Final Fantasy XVI physical to have it, and I just walked into Best Buy.
5928680	5932680	But now it's the thing where I order it online, I walk into Best Buy, hand me my product, please.
5932680	5934680	They hand me my product and I leave.
5934680	5936680	I don't really go shopping for what else is there.
5936680	5939680	So I could have missed it.
5939680	5940680	All right.
5940680	5945680	It's funny seeing Gex trilogy as the one more thing that they have.
5945680	5947680	I just I thought that was funny.
5947680	5948680	It's pretty funny.
5948680	5949680	All right.
5949680	5952680	Well, maybe this is another game that they should re-release at some point.
5952680	5954680	Dark Sakura.
5954680	5956680	Oh, good Lord.
5956680	5960680	So Daytona USA 2001.
5960680	5965680	OK, actually, not not really a bad a bad version of Daytona USA.
5966680	5971680	In the US, it came out just as Daytona USA on Dreamcast.
5971680	5977680	But now the online multiplayer has been reinstated because of Dreamcast Live.
5977680	5984680	You would have to go to Dreamcast Live's connection page for instructions on how to get your Dreamcast online.
5984680	5988680	It makes me wonder if they have Phantasy Star working now.
5988680	5991680	That had to have been the highest priority.
5991680	5998680	Yeah, but at any rate, the game is coded with the modem adapter.
5998680	6002680	Yeah, Phantasy Star Online is one of the supported ones, by the way.
6002680	6003680	Cool.
6003680	6010680	But you would basically need to use to run the game with Dream Pi.
6010680	6015680	You have to update your software and it will not work with the official broadband adapter.
6015680	6018680	So there you go.
6018680	6023680	So you have to how are you going to use a modem to do it?
6023680	6025680	Probably a virtual.
6025680	6028680	There's probably still dial up Internet services.
6028680	6030680	I mean, there are not in this.
6030680	6032680	I mean, there's a few places in this country.
6032680	6033680	But yeah.
6033680	6034680	Yeah.
6034680	6038680	I mean, if there's still a blockbuster somewhere in America, that's somebody who's using dial up.
6038680	6042680	I mean, if if NASA is still using tech from the 60s, then yes.
6042680	6047680	If Comcast is still trying to sell you landline, you know.
6047680	6048680	Right.
6048680	6049680	All right.
6049680	6053680	Well, I had to explain to someone what a landline is.
6053680	6054680	All right.
6054680	6058680	Well, moving on, Loki, what else are they going to try to sell us?
6058680	6061680	They're going to try to sell us a handheld evercade.
6061680	6065680	We'll lease a smaller handheld evercade because they already have a handheld evercade.
6065680	6070680	But the Super Pocket, it's a brand new edition that they're putting out.
6070680	6075680	They're going to have a couple of different ones available to have some packing games with them.
6075680	6080680	And you can get that in either a Capcom flavor or a Taito flavor.
6080680	6085680	So Capcom's coming with 1942, 1943, 1944.
6085680	6096680	Bionic Commando, Captain Commando, Final Fight, Forgotten Worlds, Ghouls and Ghosts, Mega Man, Street Fighter II, Hyper Fighting, Strider and Wolf of the Battlefield, Mercs.
6096680	6104680	And then the Taito edition, Bubble Bobble, Kadesh, Jack and Pop, Don, Doko Don, Elevator Action, Football Champ, Growl,
6104680	6109680	Kiki Kaikai, Legend of Kage, Liquid Kids, Operation Wolf.
6109680	6111680	Kiki Kaikai is Puck and Rocky.
6111680	6112680	Cool.
6112680	6120680	Rastan, Space Invaders, Space Invaders 91, Fairyland Story, New Zealand Story, and Vulfide.
6120680	6129680	And those are each going to be available for $59 or 49 pounds.
6129680	6134680	And yeah, they've got, look like a Game Boy kind of the setup for those.
6134680	6140680	Plus, because they are Evercades, they also have a cartridge slot that you can plug in those Evercade cartridges.
6140680	6142680	So, neato.
6142680	6149680	Also, unrelated, sort of related, I was browsing the Evercade website because I wanted to check out the stuff.
6149680	6154680	And I found the link where you can submit possible games to be included in the cartridges.
6154680	6156680	Oh.
6156680	6163680	So, I will have to send them an email and see if they want to put a game about crap on their console.
6163680	6164680	Do it.
6164680	6168680	Tell them also to actively seek out Planet Harriers, the end.
6168680	6170680	And the Guardian Legend.
6170680	6171680	PS, yeah.
6171680	6172680	PS.
6172680	6174680	The Guardian Legend didn't have an arcade version.
6174680	6177680	But there's Nintendo games and stuff.
6177680	6184680	Yeah, they're looking for NES, like, homebrew games or console homebrew games and stuff like that.
6184680	6189680	For the record, I think you can still get Gartic, the MSX version for iOS.
6189680	6190680	Oh, that's cool.
6190680	6191680	Love that.
6191680	6197680	Yeah, it's not as much fun because, you know, the MSX's big drawback was scrolling.
6197680	6198680	It didn't like it.
6198680	6203680	So, Loki reminded me when he was going through the list of the Capcom and stuff collections there for Evercade.
6203680	6206680	He reminded me of my gaming week, something I played.
6206680	6211680	And it's very, I can't believe I forgot to mention this because I thought of Dark Sakura when I did this.
6211680	6213680	So, here's what it is.
6213680	6220680	So, I was at one of our, I was at the local gay bar on Friday and it happened to be gamer night.
6220680	6222680	So, G-A-Y-M-E-R.
6222680	6224680	And this is, I'll say it was the Bolt.
6224680	6225680	So, you know, it's a...
6225680	6227680	Oh, yeah, my friend runs that.
6227680	6228680	Oh.
6228680	6229680	One of my former coworkers.
6229680	6230680	Oh, I didn't know it was like...
6230680	6231680	I think he still does.
6231680	6232680	I didn't know it was like run by, okay, well, that's cool.
6232680	6236680	Well, but my point is they have these different games throughout.
6236680	6245680	So, usually the televisions that are playing adult movies are instead changed to play video games on gamer night.
6245680	6248680	So, like Mario Karts on one TV, Smash Brothers on one TV.
6248680	6251680	I don't really like to play those because I, you know, whatever.
6251680	6252680	But they have a corner.
6252680	6260680	The other corner is the retro corner where they have an NES, excuse me, a Super Nintendo Classic and a Genesis Classic set up.
6260680	6263680	So, I was playing against my friend a little bit in Street Fighter.
6263680	6266680	But then I went over to the Genesis and I was like, oh, I want to play Sonic Spinball.
6266680	6271680	But then I was like, no, I want to play at the gay bar, Strider on the Genesis.
6271680	6272680	Yes.
6272680	6276680	It's just like the best home version of the game.
6276680	6280680	And I said Dark Sakura would be so proud of me right now.
6280680	6286680	I'm three vodka diets in, playing Strider on the Genesis at a gay bar.
6286680	6287680	Thank you very much.
6287680	6290680	And hey, at least it's not the Japanese version.
6291680	6296680	And the NES version is not a real Strider game.
6296680	6297680	Well, technically.
6297680	6301680	It is after the Strider manga.
6301680	6307680	So, it has nothing to, peripherally, only something to do with the real game.
6307680	6310680	But the actual mainline Strider series.
6310680	6313680	Yeah, yeah.
6313680	6315680	It's an AU.
6315680	6317680	It's a fanfic.
6317680	6318680	You have to remember Dark Sakura.
6318680	6322680	For those of us that didn't grow up with the Sega in our house, we only had a Nintendo.
6322680	6323680	That was Strider to us.
6323680	6326680	If you didn't grow up with the Sega in her house.
6326680	6328680	Fine.
6330680	6332680	But Nintendo Power didn't cover the Genesis version.
6332680	6334680	We had Nintendo and Super Nintendo.
6334680	6338680	And I would switch out for a TurboGrafx every so often.
6338680	6342680	And I had friends with Genesis, though, so I got to play everything.
6342680	6343680	All right.
6343680	6345680	But you know that's Dan's favorite game.
6345680	6346680	Oh, no, I know.
6346680	6348680	You always tell the story about when you first got together.
6348680	6350680	He sat you down and said, you're going to beat this game.
6350680	6355680	Yeah, that and Castlevania Symphony of the Night is a requirement.
6355680	6359680	I'm just glad he didn't make me sit down and do ghosts and goblins.
6359680	6361680	angels and ghosts, whichever one.
6361680	6364680	I know we're talking a lot about a lot about retro games tonight.
6364680	6368680	And of course, as the last story tonight, I have something else that has to do with retro for you.
6368680	6369680	And here we go, everyone.
6369680	6371680	You ready to feel old?
6371680	6377680	The Famicom, which, of course, led to the Nintendo Entertainment System, but it was called in Japan when it first came out.
6377680	6388680	The Famicom is turning 40 years old this month because it was released this month in 1983 in Japan, which, yes, it was a family computer.
6388680	6389680	We love you.
6389680	6393680	Which, yes, was the same year that we had the game industry crash going on here in the US.
6393680	6398680	But we know that the NES ended up coming out a little bit later, and it did pretty well over here.
6398680	6406680	It is interesting, though, you know, I think a lot of people kind of don't realize how different the NES and the Famicom kind of like actually were.
6406680	6414680	Like, yes, they ran, you know, essentially the same games like, you know, with the Famicom disk system did all these different things and had the extra sound chip,
6414680	6420680	which is why Metroid sounds different and a lot of games, you know, and why there was a save and load screen.
6420680	6423680	They had to do the battery pack in the US because we didn't do the disc reader here.
6423680	6430680	But anyways, of course, we all know the Famicom is what led to all of that, and it is turning 40 years old this week.
6430680	6442680	I was looking around and a website that I enjoy reading news on and Gadget was doing a little retrospective about different things that Nintendo gave us to the world through the Famicom.
6442680	6457680	And they listed the D pad was something new. Better third party games, which of course, that makes sense because that was a big part of like why the industry crashed the first time anyway is because anyone and everyone was making Atari games.
6457680	6462680	And there was a lot of shovelware fucking garbage on the Atari system towards the end of its run.
6462680	6480680	And Nintendo infamously clamped down so that you could only make so many games in a year if you were a publisher, you were limited to three games in a year, which is why we got ended up getting things like ultra games, which was just Konami under a different name in a different country.
6480680	6489680	So some infamous rules there. And then of course, people ended up just bypassing the Nintendo seal of approval altogether. Ironically, one of them being Atari.
6489680	6508680	But anyway, console game saves was something new. The video game mascot meaning Mario being a huge mascot for the industry. That was kind of new. They also mentioned the video game movie adaptation. I'm not sure. I mean, yes, the NES did bring us to that. I don't know if I necessarily agree with that one on the list, but
6508680	6526680	I would have put the wizard on there versus Mario. Yes, yes. But I do agree with the light gun being on the list because how iconic was that when it first came out and duck hunt and, you know, putting the putting the thing right against the TV so you can get all the ducks. I can't believe people didn't know.
6527680	6552680	But I knew this when I was a kid. I can't believe people didn't find out until recently that this whole time, the second controller will control the duck. My friends and I used to play it that way all the time. We found out an accident, but we found it. And we were like, Oh, the second person can be the duck. That's fun. And that's how we used to play duck hunt. I mean, let me also tell you this when you put when you have the tea when you have the gun right up against the screen. Controlling the duck doesn't fucking matter. It doesn't ducking matter.
6553680	6580680	Anyway, and they also call out the mega franchise, which I would agree with that, you know, things like Mario Brothers, Zelda, Castlevania, you know, all these games have had multiple, you know, iterations and you know, were really born on the Nintendo Entertainment System in a way that Atari 2600 in television, you know, the the ones that came before it didn't really birth franchises in the same way. So very interesting.
6580680	6606680	There to see in chat says that was in the manual, at least from what I've seen of the screenshots of the manual, which just goes to show you how many people neglected to read those damn things. Because that article that clickbaity article that was going around everywhere a couple years ago about that I got duck hunt in the garage sale, so they didn't have a manual or you rented it. I thought like like 99% of Nintendo owners had a combo cartridge of Mario Brothers and duck hunt like that was the definitive. What was it the adventure pack or so it was like the definitive
6606680	6609680	way to pick up a Nintendo action action. That was it.
6609680	6614680	Now my combo pack was breakthrough The Legend of Zelda and bubble bubble.
6614680	6624680	Weird. Okay. I do remember but if you got it like a year or two later, you might have gotten the power pack. That was Super Mario Duck hunt track me.
6624680	6648680	And I don't know my parents bought it. And then I don't know where they got it. But as like, it's like at seven, I think. So it was a while. There was a I would say the rarest one that I can think of is if you bought the one that had the robot, you didn't even get Mario Brothers. You had a gyro might was the right to show off the robot. That's, that's why they had Super Mario.
6648680	6671680	Brothers sold independently and why it's such a rare fucking cartridge. So many people didn't need to get it because the action pack ended up being the big thing that was selling here. So it's kind of funny. Anyway, this is the part of the show where we open it up to our listeners, either through our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord, that's vognetwork.com slash discord. Or, of course, we invite your email.
6671680	6674680	Let me ask dark soccer if there are any emails.
6676680	6679680	That's a funny rub. That is hilarious.
6680680	6688680	I tried the last time I assumed we didn't have one. You were like, Oh, no, there's two I was like, what? Alright, so participate at orange on radio.com.
6688680	6706680	Someone send me an email. Just say hi. Send me something interesting. Let us know what your life is like. Yeah, actually. Can I can I ugly bag for a minute. If you've been listening to this show, and you've never emailed the show before, and you've never been here on a Sunday night. I've really never been here.
6706680	6730680	Yeah, actually, can I can I ugly bag for a minute. If you've been listening to this show, and you've never emailed the show before, and you've never been here on a Sunday night. I'd really love to hear from you. And don't be shy. Like I'm a person, you're a person. I just want to know there's some other people out there that maybe we haven't heard from before. Tell, tell me your favorite video game and why it's your favorite video game and there's no wrong answers. Dark soccer, there's no wrong answers. I don't care if they say sneak king.
6736680	6738160	There's no wrong answers.
6741240	6766120	Okay. Alright, yeah, email us. I just want to I just want to cordially invite those that have never emailed us before to try it out to if you've never used email before, go to gmail.com and sign up for an account. It's really easy or there's other play outlook or Yahoo if you want if you're still in the 90s. You can do all those different sites. Now folks in chat talking about
6766120	6795680	Rob the robot. Yes, yes, I'm familiar with the name. I break man says the robot was one of the dumbest gaming gimmicks ever made. It wasn't very good, but it was pretty cool. Like my friend had it and I remember thinking because it actually it's spun little things that then would automatically hold like buttons down. And for gyro might it was gates, right? Like you had the little tops that would spin, and you'd put them down and they would they would basically allow the red
6795680	6823000	gates to the blue gates to open like it was it was. It was neat, but it was never going to go anywhere besides two games. You know, it was. So it's a it's a little piece of gaming history. And then now people in chat talking about the U force. The U force is just that's just a sign of how well Mike Tyson's punch out was received, basically. Because that thing was terrible. Anyway,
6823160	6824400	oh, yeah, it was bad.
6824800	6834440	We have a caller waiting in the green room and I'd love to talk to this person. So let's bring them on the air. Hello, orange lounge radio. Who am I talking to?
6835920	6848520	Oh, my gosh, is this? No, it's is this the Jim Sally train? I haven't I haven't seen Sally. Yeah, I haven't heard this. Oh, my God.
6848880	6854040	This is little Daniel. We were just watching your show hoping to get some news about Bloons TD6.
6854560	6861840	Oh, tell me about this. You've been talking about this because this is something that just came out and like, you were saying it was just out in Canada recently?
6862720	6867720	It just came out for free was on Netflix in Canada and the Bloons TD action is blowing up.
6867960	6868720	No.
6871160	6879240	So are you are you are you a big tower defense person before Bloons? Or is this like Bloons been your gateway into tower defense games?
6879920	6881040	Yeah, pretty much.
6882560	6885400	Jim Sally, is this is this your child that's also on the line?
6886000	6887400	This is Daniel Sally.
6887600	6888960	Oh, my gosh.
6890040	6895680	I mean, I yeah, I don't want to be that guy. But I remember when I remember when you were born, Daniel.
6898720	6900080	Yeah, Rob was right there.
6900920	6908440	Was not right there. But yeah, I yeah, that's funny. What? Daniel, what do you like about Bloons?
6909720	6911520	I don't know. It's funny.
6912520	6913120	It is fun.
6914120	6915240	Fides that we've been doing.
6916440	6919880	A lot of weird little secrets.
6921720	6924640	That was a whoopee cushion ever whoopee cushion.
6924640	6930640	I would I would expect the Jim Sally's house. There's a whoopee cushion. Yes.
6931440	6932400	There's a few.
6934960	6936680	Anyway, we're gonna let you go.
6936960	6938520	Thanks for the entertainment tonight.
6938520	6944440	It is so good to hear from you both and happy gaming and here's hoping a Bloons TD seven is out soon.
6945480	6946120	How are you guys?
6946400	6947480	Take care, guys. We'll be there.
6948840	6950640	Bye, Jim Sally. Bye, Dan Sally.
6952080	6952680	Bye.
6955000	6984600	That was adorable. It's how many years I'd like the last time Jim Sally called into this program was, I think he's done it on Discord once. But I remember like when Skype went away, he was somebody that used to call in a lot on Skype. And obviously we had to get rid of that because Skype, I think I know some of you miss it dearly. But even Skype is like aging as it like it's getting folded into teens and all this stuff. At least the business version is but Skype had a lot of technical problems that made it difficult
6984600	7005320	to incorporate into the show. And obviously Discord makes it very easy in this day and age. So we moved it over there. But yeah, I feel like it's been forever since we've heard Jim Sally. What a pleasant surprise. And then of course, now everybody in chat. Break Man is saying I must be high, really, really high. Matt says, I'm aging so fast that I'm dying. Jim Sally's kid is calling in.
7007840	7009520	How old is Julian now though?
7009880	7011960	Oh, Julian is a teenager easily.
7012560	7020600	Yeah, no, he's a think turning 15. I have to ask Becky for sure. We need to get Julian back on some point.
7020640	7027360	No bigger. Yeah. And Julian, by the but the next time we have Julian on this show, Julian's voice probably more like this now that he's
7028440	7029000	crackly.
7030720	7032320	Gonna be the wild part.
7032480	7041360	Last time I talked to him now. And he would come over and play the Dungeons and Dragons on Saturn.
7042720	7043920	What in the staria?
7045840	7046720	That's awesome. Yeah.
7047200	7058960	It's just all the like, kiddos like, and even some of our, you know, contemporaries now I should say our peers. How old were they when we met them?
7059960	7061000	Oh, well, I was
7061040	7063200	and now they're, you know,
7063600	7076240	when I first met Shane, who's now like one of my closest friends, but you know, we met, you know, with LiveJournal was really where it started. And then you know, OLR because he was a big Bamani fan as well. Um, I first met Shane when he was 19.
7077880	7078560	What about Drew?
7079080	7092880	Oh, God. Was Drew wasn't Drew like 17 when he was first going to golf? Yeah. My goodness. Yeah. But I was gonna say Shane just, Shane just turned 40. I've noticed that he was 19. Yeah, it's a long time.
7094200	7094600	Whoo.
7094600	7095680	Make me cold here.
7095720	7096280	I know.
7096280	7099480	Oh my God, what am I gonna do when I turn 50?
7099960	7102640	Same thing we always do plan to take over the world.
7103400	7107040	Stretch, kick and stretch because you're 50.
7107040	7109160	Because I'm 50 years old.
7109200	7109560	No.
7109560	7110680	Ask Travis Donovan.
7111000	7123240	If I keep up, maybe I'll be on point when I am 50. Wouldn't that be rad? And not looking any different to skincare?
7123480	7130400	I'm still hoping I mean, I may have like the fully gray beard at this point. I blame the pandemic for that. But I
7130680	7132320	It's just for men, Rad.
7132480	7141320	I don't you know, I'm not big on paying for that stuff. Because I think an industry that makes its money off people's insecurities, but it's
7141480	7143040	Oh, I think you can do like purple.
7143720	7150400	Oh, you want me to do like a crazy like a drag king beard? You may have like a drag king beard? Like a purple glitter beard? Okay.
7150880	7165360	Well, it doesn't have to be glitter. Glitter gets everywhere. But I was just telling my friend Shiley, you know, if Helen Mirren could dye her hair pastel pink and wear it to the award shows, we can do whatever the fuck we want to with our hair.
7165480	7179960	No, for sure. I love I love Helen Mirren. No, I any anytime you feel like just because you're old, you can't have fun anymore. You just have to look at people like Judi Dench. Like what would Judi Dench do? What would Patrick Stewart do? What would Ian McKellen do?
7180400	7184480	It's gonna be okay. All right.
7185200	7194960	I'm just I'm just gonna try to embrace my drunk auntie of Twitch persona. Yeah, that's me. I'm everyone's auntie.
7196480	7204920	Um, can I tell a really funny story? Actually, since we're running, we're running a little short and I do we have any last minute stories? Loki, let's get to that. And then we'll get to the okay.
7205760	7209920	All I got to do is wipe my makeup off before my stream because I'm vtubing.
7209960	7234280	Okay, I'm gonna tell a really funny story already. So we had a bumper tonight. So you know, before we have Orange Launch Radio, there's always like a little you can't do that on television bumper that plays before the show, right? There's a like, little parody type of thing. It's like Dragon Con TV and all that stuff, too. So tonight's the joke was about the FTC finally learning how to play video games,
7234280	7263320	because the long running joke is that they're old and out of touch. So I wanted to use clip art of like grandma and grandpa playing a Wii at the senior center as the clip art for that. And I found something kind of close. But when I was first searching for clip art of the right resolution, because that's be a good enough resolution, or it looks like a potato when it's coming out on the feed. When I was first looking, I was like, Okay, I'm not really getting the clip art I want. What if I Google search for? I'm even going to do this live on air. Hold on, hold on.
7265280	7266920	I know what this is.
7269320	7294040	What if I Google search? Okay, how do I do the other screen here? I'm new at that. Okay, what if I Google search old people playing Atari, and I go to the image search and I go okay, old people playing Atari, and I look at the images that come up for old people playing Atari. If you look at the results for old people playing Atari, and you scroll down just a little bit, I just want to point out one of the pictures that comes
7294040	7298920	up. It's Mel B of DDR freak fame.
7299480	7300760	Wait, who's that next to?
7300800	7317400	That's, that's Kath. Have you met Kath before? She's another friend. She's another friend of mine. Yeah, but I think if she's ever been on the show, it's only been one time. So listeners probably don't know her as well. But I know some of our old school listeners know Mel B. And so you know what I had to do, right? I immediately
7318520	7320200	immediately texted his wife.
7320200	7331960	I'm gonna do that like you suggested. It's just a message. Melody when I'm at work, and go, old people playing Atari.
7331960	7339160	The two of us have not been able to stop laughing all day. I'm gonna text her right now. Old people playing Atari.
7339160	7343960	I'm gonna text her right now. Melody. There she is.
7349880	7351720	Just did. Let's see if I get a reply.
7353880	7362280	Like if I could only, like, I shouldn't be reading private messages on the show. But you know what, if you are friends with me, then that's something that might happen once in a while.
7362280	7391080	So what so I texted it to Miss Mel. And her reply was, I'm scream laughing at a gas station in the middle of nowhere. And then I put I'm crying. And then she texts back like 15 minutes later. I'm driving north on the set with Siri. So she's dictating as she's driving. She says, I'm driving north on the five and I thought back to the image search and I got the giggles all over again. And I start laughing. So now I'm just like, that's, I'm going to just Google.
7392280	7394760	Text her out of nowhere. Old people playing Atari.
7397120	7399800	I'm in internaling plotting.
7399840	7410760	It's, it's great. It's I want a t shirt that says old people playing Atari. Can we make that vog merchandise? Yeah, I'd love that.
7410840	7411920	I can make that happen.
7412920	7437000	Because here's the other funny thing. That picture could have very easily actually, I want to say, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Old people. Well, I, I don't want to do it, Darsire, because it's an old picture. If you click on the picture, and you look at associated images, I'm almost positive I saw you posing with some other people because it was Atari party. So it's looking for related images from Atari party. And that that's where his picture.
7437560	7453280	Yeah, it's because the article was like, Atari party draws young and old to oh, yeah, no retro game. It's it. Like when you if you critically think about how that image came up in the Google search, it makes sense. It's just really fucking funny.
7454640	7455080	Yeah.
7458000	7462960	Because that could have just as easily been any of us in that picture.
7462960	7481160	You want to know how the first way I ever heard of Mel, by the way, was on the DDR internet ranking. Back in the day, my God, that's right. His name up in his location was, I'll say it, Milpena's cock land.
7486200	7490560	Because that's what they used to call MGL Milpena's golf land. Yeah, that's what they used to call it.
7491560	7492480	Well, I mean,
7494720	7495520	you heard what I said?
7495560	7504280	No, I definitely heard what you said. But yeah, it's it's a loving nickname. All right, well, on that note on that Nick node, you know,
7504320	7507520	okay, and don't look at those pictures with me there before my surgery.
7507840	7519760	Slowly, we are all turning into old people playing Atari. Old people playing Atari is I refuse. I refuse. You're like, no, no, old people playing Coleco for life.
7520640	7528800	I'm vintage and kitschy. Okay. I can say I'm vintage. That's right. Fine wine, not sour grapes.
7529000	7538200	All right, let's get everybody's final thought. And then we're gonna wrap up Dark Soccer. I'll start with you. I know you're gonna presto change and do your own stream. But Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
7539160	7551480	Um, I'm gonna have a Shay with me tonight. And we all know that Shay is chaos. We love chaos. So come join us in the fog and judge my new vtuber era.
7551520	7552280	Well fixie be there.
7552320	7557960	I'm on camera for you guys. But I'm gonna be vtubing so I can take off this makeup.
7558320	7560280	Is fixie gonna be there too? Are they joining?
7560520	7564920	I didn't see fixie online, but I'll actually I'll give them a poke.
7564920	7570360	I'm just curious if it's all you know, the squad, the bully squad, not really bully squad, the, you know,
7570440	7578760	well, Gwen hasn't been playing for a while. Apparently not really having the will to play. But I know Gwen's also going through a really hard time.
7578960	7582320	Well, hoping hoping all is improving. So
7583000	7592000	Yeah, um, and also, I just want to make a mention. I'm not gonna gonna name names, but it was the first person who interviewed me at my job.
7593360	7608600	And a manager friend. I've been on his team for a while, but he, he died very recently, left behind an infant and his wife. I'm going in August to their memorial.
7609480	7620240	But I just want to say that for anyone who knows me and probably knows who I'm talking about, you will be missed. You were one of us. And may your memory be a blessing.
7621440	7623400	All right. Any other
7625200	7626280	happy notes to end on?
7627280	7639480	Um, Dan made really good teriyaki chicken. But because it was 106 outside the chicken cooked weird. So it's got this myard browning on it to the extreme.
7641280	7649200	But it's really delicious and very nutritious. And I also have lost half an inch on my thigh from doing ballet.
7649680	7652200	Nice. All right. Food and
7652200	7654000	It's not why I'm doing it, but it's happened.
7654880	7656680	All right. Take care, have a good stream.
7656680	7658560	Good news, right? Positive news.
7658760	7683960	All right. Let's go over to Well, actually, before we wrap up, wrap up, let me also say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lawn Radio and supporting us. We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices to put out here on air. So tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever you found this show all goes an awful long way as well. So we really appreciate those of you that go the
7683960	7709120	extra mile and get your friends here to participate as well. We will be back next week for episode 969. Yes, very nice number back and forth. So we'll, we'll be here with that episode. And then we'll have a break. Because again, I'm going out to Southern fried gaming Expo in two weeks. And then yes, going back to Atlanta. I'm racking up those airline miles, except I'm flying once on one airline and flying again on another airline because I'm going to Dragon
7709120	7732560	Con. The second time I'm going it's me and Alan. Both going to Dragon Con this year, Alan's first Dragon Con. And I even asked him the other day I said, So what do you hope to do at Dragon Con? He's like, Oh, no, let's roll with it. Like, okay. All right. Uh, we'll be back next week, though. So I hope you'll be here as well. Uh, final thoughts, Loki.
7733440	7742240	I'm just gonna keep being busy with video editing. Yeah, a lot to do for the last three episodes of the season.
7742240	7771240	My final thought is I have major side quest cleanup and Final Fantasy 16 still that I want to get to. That is very important, but also very excited Diablo four season one. Looking forward to that starting on Thursday. So I'll be streaming that over on my personal stream at Rob Roberts here on Twitch. I don't know if I'll, I don't know what I'm going to play to fill in the gap. In the meantime, I have a couple days where I have nothing, but I have theater them DLC, I can do that. I'll probably do theater the one day, but then I'm not sure I wanted to do like Alan Wake remastered.
7772240	7802240	But I don't think I have enough time before the Diablo season. So that'll probably be a game I play after a few streams of Diablo four season one. Unfortunately, I missed the no man's sky expedition. I did the one stream on my birthday and I cleared the first set of challenges. But unfortunately, that expedition ended on July 12. And I never was able to play it again because I was too busy playing Final Fantasy 16. But there are worst ways to be lost in space. So on that note, thank you everybody for listening to Orange
7802240	7832240	Lounge Radio. We will see you again in seven days. Have a wonderful night. Thank you and goodbye.
7832240	7838240	This is not the news of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
