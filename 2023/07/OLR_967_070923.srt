1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,880
The action in play-to-earn games is boring. What's the point if the games are no fun?

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,260
I agree with this entirely for myself, but fun means different things to different people.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,380
Like the recent news about how over 1 million players play exclusively Call of Duty releases.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,980
But we agree that interactive blockchain grinds are dying before they're even out of the gate.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,140
This is the ultra-narrow opening headline intro. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,700
Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you the source of this quote and the rest of the

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,820
week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,700
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:52,820
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 967

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:01,060
of our program for tonight, July 9th, 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined live

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,740
on this lovely Sunday evening as I am quite often over the last 21 years with my co-hosts.

12
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,220
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I'm on a recruitment drive.

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,220
On a recruitment drive. Are you recruiting for your cult that involves lambs?

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,220
No, for one more follow-up. Oh, yes, of course. Here at the VOG.

15
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,500
One more person. That's right. It would be a lovely

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,180
hurdle to cross to get 500 followers here. Well, I guess it's a good opportunity for me to plug

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,340
that we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,820
at the Voice of Geeks network at twitch.tv, VOG network on Twitch. And if you'd follow,

19
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,780
we would super appreciate that. We are on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, typically,

20
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,420
but unfortunately Bobby was not on tonight again. He wasn't on last week as he was

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,860
doing other things. But tonight, unfortunately, he's under the weather. He might be lurking in

22
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:01,300
chat, but yeah, feel better soon, Bobby. Sorry to hear that. That's always the most terrible way to

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,500
end a trip is to get sick. He said it's not the big one, but you know, everything else is floating

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,700
around out there these days. I mean, I say this as somebody who had strep for a month, basically,

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,300
and just got over that. So it's always something. Well, it's always Techmaster Loki.

26
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,860
Oh, yeah, right. Well, hey, Loki, how are you? Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah, good deal. I noticed

27
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,900
in your background tonight, you still have et going in. I haven't I haven't updated the video

28
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,220
yet. That's fine. That's it. It'll be a new video. It reminds me I need to try that game already.

29
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,420
It's very fun. I played it. I played it a little bit this week. Yeah. Yeah. It's just an itch.io

30
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,420
thing, right? It's not like Yeah, it's completely free. It's a unity game. So you can actually

31
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:53,300
download it or stream it from itch.io. And it's, you know, it's fun. It's a good time waster.

32
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,660
Yeah, yeah. No, I the vampire survivors and all the clones are a lot of fun. Like there was one

33
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,540
called like Soulstone survivors I played there was there was another there's there's several of them

34
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,620
out there now. It's like a whole new genre of games. Most of them are pretty fun. I mean,

35
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,940
as with many genres, there are always cheap knockoffs as well. But that that is pretty good,

36
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:24,500
for what it's worth. So did you change it? Just Yes, you change. I told you I was changing it.

37
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,460
Fine. So what are we looking at now? Gravity Circuit. It's a game coming out,

38
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,260
I think this week, actually. What's is this? Like, I'm getting Megaman vibes just off the

39
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,340
splash. Yeah, it's a little bit it's kind of got that Megaman vibe to it. It's not exactly

40
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,580
like Megaman. It's like a brawler. But it's also a little bit Megaman a little bit like

41
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,100
metal slug. I don't know. It's pretty cool looking, though. I was gonna say Megaman did

42
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,860
have those the power battle arcade games that I feel like were relatively rare, but then they

43
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,740
would show up on these collections. It's Yeah, it's more like I would say, I guess maybe like

44
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,900
Shovel Knight a little bit, you know, whereas they don't. The main character doesn't have

45
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,420
like a projectile. It's more of just brawling the enemies. But it's still,

46
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,540
you know, a little bit of Ninja Gaiden in there as well. Okay. Yeah, it looks cool.

47
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,140
All right. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's definitely giving me more like Ninja Gaiden vibes than

48
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:26,260
Megaman. But yes, it's very fast. Ninja Gaiden's play style with Megaman's graphics.

49
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,220
It's sort of Yeah, sort of. All right. We've got some video game news to cover as we often do here

50
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,940
on the program. And then of course, the things you all have to say over on our Twitch chat channel.

51
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,460
Again, twitch.tv slash vog network as we are live on Sunday nights, dark to see us starting us off

52
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,020
with a follow up to something I was just saying, saying I'm surprised the power battle stuff hasn't

53
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,300
been re released recently. With all the Megaman love the digital clips is giving from them is

54
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,140
giving them lately. Well, it's I thought it was part of one of them. I thought it

55
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,340
didn't come out recently, too. But I was in one of the collections recently to me could be like

56
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,220
10 years ago, to be quite honest. I but I do think I feel like they were in one of those Megaman

57
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,580
collections that came out not long ago. I'm pretty sure they were break man says Capcom collection

58
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,540
too. It's Yeah, I was gonna say I knew it was in one of them because they even I think they did

59
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,420
the soccer game as well. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah, there was like a whole like Megaman collection

60
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,420
thing that had come out relatively recently. I always forget about the arcade stadium

61
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,780
collection too. And you know, Capcom does a really good job I think of embracing a lot of their retro

62
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,060
library. Well, we just talked about like not even two weeks ago on the show they were they launched

63
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,780
like an anniversary website and you could actually play just right in your browser. The original

64
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,300
Megaman or you could load up the Rockman Japanese ROM, you can see how much different Rockman two is

65
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,220
difficulty wise for what we got as Megaman two, you know, things like that. It's all

66
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,060
on the web, you can just fire it up. So pretty cool. So all right. But let's talk about what's

67
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,140
going on in gaming a little less Capcom to start us off and a little more Sega, but maybe maybe of

68
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:17,620
a classic era Loki. Yeah, it's not necessarily so when you hear like, you know, leaks coming from

69
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,620
a company, you may think, Oh, my goodness, you know, what, what can we find out? Well, not much, because

70
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:31,300
this happened. These are documents from the 90s. So like, it's, it's been a while. So there were some

71
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:39,460
documents that were leaked out from Sega. These included everything from like, financial statements

72
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:48,420
to emails, you know, from internally within Sega, some stuff talking about the Sega Saturn versus

73
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,620
Sony PlayStation, that type of stuff. Nothing really like super interesting. I mean, aside outside

74
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,100
of like, kind of fascination, there's nothing really like, oh, there was there was a game we

75
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,900
didn't know about or something like that. Well, wasn't there like a vector man three or something

76
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,420
I think was Yeah, they talked about that a while back. But like, I don't know if that was actually

77
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,140
ever that ever came out. Nothing like substantial. Like it's not like we're getting an entire ROM of

78
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,180
an unreleased. You know, it's it's no it's like marketing strategy. Maybe for different things.

79
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,300
pitches. Yeah. Yeah. So that's all on Sega Sega retro. If you want to check out some of the stuff

80
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,900
that's in there. Yeah, it's just, I don't know. It's a downloadable PDF. Yeah, it looks interesting.

81
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,020
I mean, but a lot of it is just like marketing stuff. Like, for example, they have one right

82
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:49,380
here. April 1 1996. The subject is the Saturn airport storyboard. And then they have like,

83
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,020
a few concerns. And it's just like talking about things that they want to change on the marketing.

84
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,100
I think it's it's this is one of those things. Like if you're a retro enthusiast,

85
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,620
enthusiast, enthusiast, it's a very unique kind of peek behind the curtain. And I know,

86
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,980
you know, we talk about leaks and stuff, it's always a little bit of a slippery slope, because

87
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,220
some of this stuff is, you know, a little bit shady, sometimes in the way it's obtained.

88
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,860
This is, you know, 30 to 25 30 year old stuff, you know, coming from a company that isn't actively

89
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,060
making any of these products anymore. I mean, yes, they're still in gaming, but they're not in

90
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,300
hardware. So I think it this is more for, you know, archivists. And, you know, folks that are

91
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,740
really enthusiastic about retro gaming. I mean, I believe there was some books being written not that

92
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,140
long ago about the Nintendo versus Sega wars. And I want to say they had option a movie or

93
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,580
something like I want to say that's why that that topic had come up not that long ago is that they

94
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,460
were looking at doing like a movie or something. So if you are kind of like fascinated by that era,

95
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,700
I think this is something that's like, oh, this is really neat, because it's a really

96
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,900
interesting peek behind the curtain as to you know, where might things have gone wrong for

97
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,060
Sega? I mean, I'm sure everybody's kind of formed some opinions, but, you know, kind of gives a

98
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,220
little more substance substance to that about like, okay, what what worse of the decision

99
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,620
being made? Where were some of the hang ups? So it's, it's interesting. But I think that's about

100
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:16,340
as far as it goes. It's interesting. It read it slash mildly interesting. Is that for me?

101
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,660
Kind of Yeah, it's it's interesting. There's a lot of just reports in here. A lot of mainframe

102
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,740
reports, which I mean, that's your thing. There you go.

103
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,020
Mainframe reports. Golly, there's this guy, Rob Roberts, who calls in on his Dreamcast all the

104
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,220
time playing Phantasy Star Online. Wow, that's loading up the mainframe. It's kind of cool. They

105
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,860
got like, they have storyboards for commercials on here as well. So that's kind of fun. And,

106
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,940
you know, the commercials of that era were really unique, right? We all remember, like,

107
00:09:51,940 --> 00:10:00,180
Sega does what Nintendon't. And it was this very, like, it's so cringe to go back now and look at

108
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:08,260
how can we attract 90s youth? How can we attract Gen X with these, you know, advertisements?

109
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,380
And even with that, like one of the notations that they had in one of the emails that was on there

110
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,900
that was showcased was that, you know, Nintendo is going to come out and they're going to market

111
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:25,780
their Nintendo 64 as the ultimate gaming machine. We have to get in front of that. And basically,

112
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,180
like, we have to call ours the ultimate gaming machine first, so they can't do it. You know,

113
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,820
it's kind of funny. Yeah. Breakman in chat over at Twitch TV VOG Network says,

114
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,700
I remember the stupid school arguments over which system was better. The fact is, we all wished our

115
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,500
parents could afford both systems. You know, what's interesting, though, some things never

116
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,900
change. I mean, I feel like on social media, certain areas, you still see a lot of the

117
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:59,300
PlayStation versus Xbox. But it's interesting, because I don't feel the same sort of approach

118
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,340
from the companies, right? We often see now a little more again, on social media, you'll see

119
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:11,860
things like, you know, Microsoft or Phil Spencer openly congratulating Nintendo or even PlayStation

120
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,700
on the release of a major product, you see interesting things like, you know, cross

121
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:24,660
platform, online play, right? Like, I know, we don't talk a lot about sports games on this show.

122
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,820
So I know it's not on our show roll, but I'm aware that NBA 2k 24 is that what it's called

123
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,820
the new the new NBA 2024 was recently announced, it's coming out in September, and they're talking

124
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,380
about cross platform play on it, which, you know, is something that if that was even available in

125
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,300
the 90s, obviously, the technologies changed a lot, that would have never happened the way

126
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,380
the companies were in the 90s. You know what I mean? Yeah. So it even though I think the console

127
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,420
war still exists to an extent, I think it's really driven by this audience who just like,

128
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:05,140
feels the need to be on a winning team. Or something. I don't know. Sometimes I

129
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:11,140
yeah, it's the team mentality. Or it's like, it's almost goes back to a lot of people that

130
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,380
are really into like high school football. Yeah, high school sports. It's like, they're very much

131
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,900
like, I like our team has to win. It like goes in the politics. It goes into everything. It's like,

132
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,220
I see youtubers that get really into this. And I understand part of it is probably

133
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,900
click driven. It's sensational. It's click driven, but I can't help but kind of like roll

134
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:38,260
my eyes at some of it. And it's because I'm just kind of like, I like grow up like it just like to

135
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,020
me, like some of that just kind of shows a lot. I maybe I'm being really rude, but I it shows a

136
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:51,220
lack of critical thinking. I feel like when you get really, really into how to think those console

137
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,380
wars that you can't you're like unable to see things from the other side. I don't know. I just

138
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,980
think of some things that I see sometimes and it's people that I know too. And I'm just kind

139
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,060
of like, it's kind of a human thing. Yeah, people like like two things. Number one,

140
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,940
things that reinforce their own core beliefs. And number two, echo chambers. Yeah, yeah. Well,

141
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,100
yeah. I mean, God, look at look at what social media is huge on those. Absolutely. That's even

142
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,940
beyond the console wars. But yes, the thing is that they assume other people are like that.

143
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,500
And it's funny when you're not a person who's like that, then people don't know what to think

144
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,260
about you. Like when I was a kid, I kinda you know, I played everything I could get my hands

145
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,820
on. I didn't really I mean, I love my Super Nintendo more because I love the games on it

146
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,420
more. But I certainly like to sit down with some sonic action, you know.

147
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,020
Comment from chat Zen monkey 11 says I kept up with both systems through the 80s 90s,

148
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,700
odds, etc. Some systems ran games a lot better than others. So console wars is needed to help

149
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,900
people make the right choice for themselves. I'm not saying you can't like sit there and say

150
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,380
evaluate PlayStation, evaluate Microsoft, evaluate Nintendo, evaluate their offerings and see what's

151
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,980
the right choice for you. And there was something about the marketing in the 80s and 90s that really

152
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,100
encouraged all those sorts of fanboy wars and the things that we're seeing. And my point is,

153
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,140
it's okay to sit there and say, okay, now that I've kind of evaluated this and what you're

154
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,540
talking about, like the graphics and what runs better, or I think a lot in this day and age where

155
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,740
the first party exclusives are or weighing something like game pass versus God of War,

156
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,380
Last of Us, etc, etc. Nintendo exclusives, portability, all that once you weigh all of

157
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:46,580
those and you decide this is the right system for me. That's great. That's that's much different

158
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:54,820
than the fanboy wars. The fanboy wars I'm talking about are PlayStation is the right console for me

159
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:01,460
and for everybody else. And if you don't agree with me, you're wrong for the following reasons,

160
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,060
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's the difference. Yeah.

161
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,380
Game of ticks. Oh my god. Perfect. Perfect.

162
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,540
Copyright Jamie 2023. You steal my word. I kick you in the shin.

163
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,620
No, no, but monetize it. Trademark it. Patent pending. Put it on a shirt.

164
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,220
Game of ticks. I'm over it.

165
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,940
Game of ticks.

166
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,860
By the way, I don't usually shout these out live on the show. But because it is a special occasion,

167
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,660
I do want to say a special shout out to our 500th follower Rob Way. Thank you. Congratulations.

168
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,900
Thank you. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Breakman says I don't have a PlayStation five because I

169
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,380
don't have all the free time in the world. Not because I hate PlayStation. That's like, again,

170
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,300
you have to, I know a lot of people that are really upset because they want to play Final

171
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,180
Fantasy 16. But it's like the PlayStation five. It's like, I don't want to spend the money on,

172
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,980
and I completely understand that. PlayStation fives aren't cheap. Like, yes, I completely

173
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:10,340
recognize I have the privilege of the job that I have and the income that I have and that I am in

174
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,540
a double income, no kid household. And that affords me certain luxuries like being able to buy

175
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,860
a PlayStation, you know, save up and you know, everything else. I can't buy everything I want

176
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,900
in this world. Like I didn't go get a VR two as well. If I had limitless income, I probably would.

177
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,900
But I do recognize I'm able to do that. And not everybody else can. And that that's something else

178
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,620
to get in these family wars. I could get a PS five or I could get weird Al pinball.

179
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,100
Right.

180
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,540
Or money toward weird Al.

181
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,220
You know, so I'm reminded

182
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,580
All the money I spent on I had to rebuy all my Dead by Daylight DLC.

183
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,620
To put a pin in this a little bit and move on to the other part of the Sega story I want to talk

184
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,220
about. But I'm reminded of and it was several years ago and I want to say and I don't know if

185
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,460
I'm crediting the wrong person for this comment. So I'm sorry, but memory, it's the first thing to

186
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,540
go. Or actually, the joke is memory is the second thing to go. What's the first thing? Get it. So

187
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,340
I believe it was no one special 77. In the early days of listening to this show said,

188
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,060
Well, I don't know if I really count as a gamer, because I just have an N 64. And I play a lot of

189
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:28,180
games on the N 64. Because that's all I'm able to afford. And I believe our response was a resounding

190
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,860
Yeah, you're still a gamer. You're 100% a gamer. You're just as much of a gamer as anyone else

191
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,780
here at the table. Like you're playing video games, are you not on a pretty incredible system, right?

192
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,940
Like, just because you're not with the latest and greatest and the coolest technology. I mean,

193
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,420
the awesome thing about how far this industry has come in 30 years is that there are a metric

194
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:59,380
fuck ton of amazing retro classics for you to go revisit. And that's why preservation is so

195
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,340
important, right? And why we, you know, can't stand to see games like disappear or become

196
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,820
inaccessible at a certain point. Thankfully, most of the cartridge games that we kind of think of

197
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,860
when we think of 80s and 90s, and even early CD ROM things don't have this problem. But like,

198
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,660
you know, like, look at the game that Loki's got playing in his background. It makes you think,

199
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:26,100
oh, man, going back and playing Megaman, Ninja Gaiden, like those, those are amazing classics

200
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,140
that are worth revisiting always and always, right? So it doesn't make you any less of a gamer

201
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,820
if you're not able to play Final Fantasy 16 right now, because you can't drop 500 plus another 70

202
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:45,220
bucks on the investment that it takes. So anyway, um, other comments in chat. Tiger class says the

203
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,700
issue with getting a PS five is it's not backwards compatible with the PS four games. So my head

204
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,260
games on the PS four, you haven't gotten around to playing camp. That's not true. It is actually

205
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,220
backwards compatible with PS four, you might be thinking of PS four and PS three. But I mean,

206
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,740
where you might be is if you get the digital only one, then obviously you can't put a disk in that.

207
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,780
But you can put a PS four disk in a disk enabled PS five and it will work. It actually is backwards

208
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,380
compatible. So just, just a heads up. But I realized, you know, again, with a lot going

209
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,620
digital, it kind of, you know, changes things and all that stuff. So anyway, dark to see, I think

210
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,580
my memory is actually right, because he also remembers that and I trust dark to see his memory

211
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,180
of this show better, better than my own, quite frankly. So um, and another interesting comment

212
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,540
from sj 100. Matt, who says I want a PS five now, I didn't before because there weren't enough games

213
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,100
for me to justify the separate purchase. Now there are but I don't have enough time to play.

214
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,500
And I think that's also totally okay. Like you don't have to get a new system day one. I didn't

215
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,900
get a PS five day one. I got a PS five when I finally was like, okay, yep, Final Fantasy 16

216
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,340
is coming. And there's these other games I want to play, including theater them a PS four game,

217
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,380
going back to what I had said earlier, and some of these other just, you know, other things on PS

218
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,940
five, like returnal and other things that like now there's enough games where I want to pick

219
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,060
one up and do that, but I didn't buy one day one. They were also impossible to find day one,

220
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:19,860
but that's another argument. All right, anyhow, let's move on. I there's another side of this

221
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:26,420
whole Sega thing in the more recent element, right? Yeah. Yeah. So a bit of a relief, actually.

222
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:34,980
So the you may remember Sega was gonna, you know, invest some of their money, I assume,

223
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:42,500
and time into getting into the NFT business. But they have decided that no, they're not going to

224
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,060
do that. Instead, they according to the chief operating officer, they're going to be withholding

225
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:55,300
its biggest franchise from third party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content

226
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:01,860
also be shelving plans to develop their own games in that genre for at least now. So we're looking

227
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,460
into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry. After all, the

228
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,220
basically having concerns, you know, at least right now they're saying that their biggest

229
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:21,060
franchises are off the table. Also, they were saying that the action in play to earn games

230
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:27,060
is boring. What's the point of games if they're no fun? I mean, yeah, exactly.

231
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,100
It sounds like some wise decisions are being made at Sega right now. So keep up the good work. I

232
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,900
mean, they probably just see the market tanking. So they're like, yeah, you know, not only can we

233
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,860
not invest in this market that's not really thriving, but we can also get some more,

234
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,820
you know, some value with our, our fans to let them know, hey, we're not going to touch that

235
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,740
trash, even though we said we're going to touch that trash. Well, I think it also kind of puts

236
00:21:52,740 --> 00:22:00,180
a pin on exactly what a flash in the pan or to be flash in the pan. This whole NFT stuff was

237
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,580
because like, you know, one day everybody's like, Oh, this is gonna be the next big thing. And now

238
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,380
what has been like, not even eight months. And everybody's like, nevermind. Nevermind.

239
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,500
Well, that's the thing about the specular market. Whoops, bad call, abort, abort.

240
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,780
It's hard to speculate when it's crashing. Yeah.

241
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:27,140
So, I mean, but I can't think that many of us were fans of the whole NFT thing to begin with.

242
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,660
So, you know, it's one of those like, no love lost here. So I'm glad they figured it out before they

243
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:38,420
had a real stinker of a game come out or something like that, you know, I think, yeah.

244
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:45,460
That's that. All right. Well, good. I hope for the best out of Sega for the future. You know,

245
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,540
it sounds like they've got some exciting revivals potentially in the works. I mean, nothing

246
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:55,460
officially confirmed. But you know, those rumors about crazy taxi and jet set radio and also like,

247
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,740
they won't go away. So who knows? Maybe someday, maybe someday. All right. Well, in the meantime,

248
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,140
let's talk about some of the games that we have been playing this week, whether they be classics

249
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,700
or new shiny things in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week? So DarkSakura,

250
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:22,500
how was your gaming week? It was. It just was. I did, of course, Dead by Daylight. I got

251
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:31,220
at least all of the cosmetics from the Rift or whatever the new Rift-y thing is, whatever it's

252
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:41,940
called. So, yeah, that's done. I did Midnight Suns. I did Cult of the Lamb. I played some

253
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:52,420
Black Knight 3000. I played some World Cup Soccer. Yeah. I've mostly been working on like Vtuber

254
00:23:52,420 --> 00:24:00,740
stuff. I've been fighting with trying to get a model that I made in Daz 3D, which I've gotten

255
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:09,460
into Blender just fine. But then it's getting it to export with its textures and then getting the

256
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:18,900
rig to stick to the mesh when I do the export. So I just need somebody who is better at that

257
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,700
than I am to compile it for me. I've played with it for days and it's a pain in the ass and I think

258
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,460
I have to do it through Unity or some shit. And I have Unity. I haven't touched it. So I'm just

259
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:41,700
going to stick with the... I'm trying to make it as less YY anime waifu as I can, but she still

260
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,500
looks pretty anime waifu. And honestly, it's pretty cute. I have retextured a bunch of clothes,

261
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,940
so that's kind of what I've been doing. And since I got it through Steam, I'm counting it as part

262
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:58,020
of my gaming week. I have to admit, I'm going to be transparent and say it's taken me a long time

263
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:04,340
to kind of get the Vtuber thing. I was always kind of like, I don't know if it's as interesting to me

264
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,540
as watching somebody in an actual cam. So you're seeing unprocessed reactions, things like that.

265
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,420
But that being said, as I've been doing my Final Fantasy 16 playthrough, I don't stream all of it.

266
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,060
Some of it I do off stream and when I do the off stream stuff, I go off cam and I just record it

267
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,780
for YouTube and I put just the gameplay up there. And I have to admit, I definitely notice the

268
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:32,980
amount of extrovert energy. And you all know I'm very much an extrovert, but it's not an

269
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:40,980
infinite tank. I have a big tank, but I don't have an infinite tank. And I definitely notice how much

270
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:46,420
less energy I feel like I'm using not being on actual camera and the lights and all that and

271
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:54,740
doing that than when I am. And so I get it from the person trying to create regular content,

272
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,740
but doesn't always have the spoons or whatever you want to call it for it. I get it from that

273
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:06,740
perspective. I really do. Well, there's a little bit for it. For me is the fact that I don't always

274
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:14,020
want to put on a full face of makeup. Especially for my early day Monday stream, when I'm done,

275
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:21,780
I'm going into doing 45 minutes worth of stretches and warm up before my ballet. I don't want to do

276
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,940
that with full face makeup on. And I certainly don't want to come back from doing it when I

277
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,340
do it while I'm playing Cult of the Lamb and just trying to chill before I take a shower and go to

278
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:41,860
bed. But people like to have some type of person image that they can acknowledge and or interact

279
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:48,420
with, or at least see that something is going on that there might be a person attached to it.

280
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,620
And that's the allure of having a VTuber. It also is a way to control your brand.

281
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:01,780
And I can put up some pictures real quick to show people what I've been working on,

282
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,460
if you're really interested. Yeah. And I get it because at least even with the VTuber,

283
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,780
you still see smile, you still see laugh, you still see movement looking. There's a lot that

284
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:21,140
you are still able to get. So yeah, I get it a lot more than I used to. And that's just maybe the old

285
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:27,220
man in me taking time to roll around. I mean, it took me a while to get Twitch. Now here we are.

286
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,220
So you know, it's fine. Sometimes I'm slow to the party. It is what it is.

287
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:42,420
All right. Well, I also think that I can get something to go through my camo app. It's just

288
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,100
going to be some doing so. All right. Let's go over to Loki, your gaming week.

289
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,740
Um, my week, I played mostly Minecraft. So I put out an episode this week. And then

290
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:04,980
it's been a little bit of that ET sequel, if you will, waste a little bit of time in that

291
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,820
and a little bit of protocol game. And I think that was it actually.

292
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,340
Okay. Let's see my gaming week. So honestly, it was

293
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,100
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't remember one more. I forgot. I downloaded it on my phone,

294
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:27,380
a group coaster because I was getting the urge to play some group coasters. So I was playing that.

295
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,620
Okay, nice. Um, let's see my gaming week. Honestly, mostly Final Fantasy 16. It's pretty

296
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,900
much all I've been playing. Um, obviously it was a little bit hit and miss of the week with

297
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,780
a holiday and everything, but I'm 70% of the way through the game now, which, uh, is that because

298
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,780
on your PlayStation main screen, it'll tell you how far you are through the game, but it doesn't

299
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:51,220
count side quests. Um, but I, I would imagine I'm kind of a similar progress through side quests.

300
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,900
There's only a couple I haven't finished at this point. Um, but yeah, I'm 70% of the way through

301
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,860
the game. So I'm, I'm hoping I can beat it this next week. I did not get as much play in this

302
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,140
weekend as I'd hoped, but you know, so it goes sometimes just IRL getting in the way. Uh, like

303
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,300
I hosted a show yesterday. It was a lot of fun, but it kept me away from Twitch all day. So, you

304
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,100
know, it is what it is. Um, so I'm hoping I'll beat Final Fantasy 16 this week. I really want

305
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:21,380
to be done with 16 in the next week because Diablo four's first season starts on the 20th.

306
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,940
And here I've been thinking this whole time, Oh, it's going to start the weekend. I go to Atlanta

307
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,260
for Southern fried game gaming expo. And actually, no, it starts the week before.

308
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:36,100
So I can actually get some time in before I go off to Southern fried gaming expo, which by the way,

309
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,580
if you forgot is a thing that is happening at the end of the month in Atlanta last weekend of July.

310
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,060
I hope to see you there. If you are in the area, um, I will be there for the first time for their,

311
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,820
um, 10th anniversary show. Uh, as a result, we will not be here on July 30th. Sorry about that.

312
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,580
Um, and then also five weeks later when I go back to Atlanta for dragon con, but that's all right.

313
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,500
I have actually math doubt that I have spent, um, obviously the most time of my life I have spent

314
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,180
in Sacramento, but now the sec, the city I have spent the second most time in my life is Atlanta

315
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,980
with between 10 dragon cons. I've spent more time in Atlanta, even over, um, the Philadelphia area

316
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,060
that I used to go to a lot for work. So I've, I've actually spent more time in Atlanta now.

317
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:26,340
So, um, questmaster and chat says finally finished Final Fantasy 16 today. No spoiling it.

318
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,580
Thank you. Of course. Uh, but it was an adventure worth experiencing from start to finish for me.

319
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,660
Yeah. I've still been enjoying it. I am going to say though, I am at this point in the game,

320
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:39,540
70% of the way through I re like the last time I was streaming the main story quest. I even kind

321
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:46,020
of said this. I'm like, these are really uninteresting filler quests that I'm going

322
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:53,300
through right now. Like I, I unfortunately, I think part of the drawback of Final Fantasy 16,

323
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,300
having such a strong opening and then these moments throughout the game that are also

324
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:06,180
very strong and just very like, Holy crap. Most of them centered around the icon versus icon fights.

325
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:12,020
Most of them. Um, it makes those periods in between to kind of get to like, really seem

326
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,500
like, okay, let's go, let's go. Let's get back to the interesting stuff. Like it's, it's like

327
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,860
watching again, it's like watching a TV show, like Game of Thrones will say, and like some episodes

328
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,700
are like filler episodes and some episodes are like red wedding, right? It's like, there's a

329
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,420
lot of plot in some episodes and some episodes are a little more, okay. It's, you know, it's,

330
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:40,660
it's not quite as interesting as the others. So also quickly on Final Fantasy 16, I'm going to

331
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:49,620
say this as spoiler free as I can. I did get to the explicit gay scene that had the game banned

332
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:57,860
in Saudi Arabia. It's as, as was said plenty of times on this program, when that new story first

333
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:07,300
came out. It was not sexual in the least. It was a kiss between two guys. That's it. And it was,

334
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,460
it was also a reveal of sorts, because you knew nothing about, again, I'm being very vague

335
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,900
intentionally, you knew nothing about the sexuality or the interest of the said character

336
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,020
in question. And it's one of those things that just kind of like explains that a little bit and

337
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:33,060
their relationship a little bit out of the blue. And I have to say I was really pleasantly

338
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:39,060
surprised by it. I mean, of course, I enjoy the representation. The only thing that made me

339
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:46,260
irritated about that whole situation was that right before the same day I got to that scene

340
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:54,100
that morning on and I'm naming names Kotaku, they ran a story about the relationship and in the

341
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,340
fucking thumbnail that went on social media, they showed the two characters that were in

342
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:05,620
the relationship. And so I already knew going into it. That was fucked. I'm sorry. That was,

343
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:12,020
that was really fucked to do for clicks. The game has not even been out a month. That, that was,

344
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:19,300
that was fucky to ruin that for people. Because I also think part of the way they did that,

345
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,580
and the nice thing about that is that it was like 20 hours into the game before that was revealed.

346
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:33,620
And again, without the Saudi Arabia thing, nobody ever said anything about the same

347
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:38,020
sex relationship. It never came up in the pre, unless they were asked about it again,

348
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,420
because of the Saudi Arabia thing, it never came up. It was not a selling point for the

349
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,500
game. It was not something they were advertising. It was just something that happened as

350
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,740
it tends to be in life. It just, it just, these people are gay. Okay, deal with it. Like that's

351
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,740
it. It's that simple. And the reason why I like how they did what they did 20 hours into the game

352
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:07,780
is because most people, again, in our flash judgment society and social media, they've

353
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:13,780
already after the demo two hours into the game, after their first night in the game, five, six,

354
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,580
seven hours into the game, they've already splashed all over social media. I love this

355
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,940
game. This is amazing. These combats are awesome. These icon fights are great. Oh my God, this is

356
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,460
great. This could be one of the best Final Fantasies. Everybody's already putting that

357
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:33,140
out there, right? So that way, when that scene shows up, they're going to really look like

358
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:39,380
they're putting their clown dress on. If they go back and go, Final Fantasy gone woke, go broke,

359
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,700
don't buy Final Fantasy because they're shoving that gay agenda down our throats.

360
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:52,340
They fucking got you bitch, by by putting that in there subtly the way they did. But and in all

361
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:58,020
fairness, and I said this also, again, when the you know, Saudi Arabia kind of first revealed that

362
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,420
there would be same sex relationship content in the game. It is hard for me to get out the

363
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,380
confetti cannons and celebrate this because I do think this is done well. It is hard for me to get

364
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:13,140
out the confetti cannons and celebrate this when meanwhile, we have these other issues with this.

365
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:19,780
With the racial representation and how that was not done. In a way we would have would have liked

366
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:26,260
to have seen it. So it's kind of one of those restrained celebrations where it's like, Oh,

367
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,260
good. I'm glad they did it that way. It's really unfortunate. They couldn't figure this out

368
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:38,500
for all other types of minorities as well. But quest buster in chat says that scene was

369
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,340
something that just happens between two people that love each other is that if it was a dude

370
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:49,140
and a woman, not nobody it was it would be like completely like whatever like like it actually

371
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:56,020
like if you really take a step back to think about that scene, it is absolutely a nothing burger for

372
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:03,300
a heterosexual relationship. It is nothing. But the fact that it's two dudes are going to make

373
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:12,740
people go Oh, oh, oh, I, I wait for the day or I would love the day to happen where no one cares.

374
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,820
And that's, that's, and the nice thing is, for better for worse in Valstia.

375
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,420
No one cares. It's just, it's just there. That's how it should be.

376
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,100
That's right. Anyway. All right. That was my high school 16. The only other thing I really played

377
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,700
this week was I played Dead by Daylight actually, because it's it isn't I the thing with Dead by

378
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,500
Daylight, I only play like one or two matches tops. I'm like, okay, I'm done. But that's still

379
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,540
been enough for me. I have like 60. I'm playing it differently this time. And instead of trying

380
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,900
to get a couple of me see, instead of trying to get Tara Mises on everybody. I'm just I'm pouring

381
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:57,460
all of my points into Leon Chris Carlos, the himbo trilogy. I'm pouring all of my points into

382
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,060
my favorite himbos in the game. And I'm up to like 60 Tara Mises, which for me is a lot.

383
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,300
But what what the funny thing about that is I'm also finding not only do I have like 60

384
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:14,340
Tara Mises, I now have like 80 anniversary med kits and like 80 toolboxes and fly I never

385
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,860
use flashlights. I'm terrible flesh. But like, I have all of these other anniversary stuff too,

386
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,260
that I'm just getting all on my favorite himbo by daylight, folks. So good times.

387
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:36,660
Rob, we need to have you back for for my favorite redeem the Resident Evil roleplay redeem.

388
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,980
That was your crit was brilliant. So we have a little a little special cannon

389
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:54,180
in our special Resident Evil part of the dead by daylight universe, where Ada and and Leon

390
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,660
celebrate every match by either going to Sizzler or the Brazilian barbecue and they leave Claire

391
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:04,900
at Sizzler. Claire steals Ada's rocket launchers and Chris is a caveman apparently.

392
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,780
That's the way I played Chris. He's a himbo. He's our he's our builder punching asshole.

393
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:21,700
All right. It's fanfic by daylight. Yeah. All right. Let's get into some other news

394
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,380
going on in some other games around the gaming universe. And of course, we'll get to your

395
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,980
comments and calls much later on in the program when we get to our listener roundtable,

396
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,140
but we still have some stories to get to first. So Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

397
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:46,020
In the further tales of more old things leaking, we have the Far Cry one source code leaking from

398
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:55,300
2004. That's right. The original Far Cry has been leaked, and it is now on the Internet Archive.

399
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:05,860
The theory behind this is that it came from a possible update to the game that they were adding

400
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:12,900
the Ubisoft Game Launcher or DRM. This is basically it was, I think,

401
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:21,540
put in there by the or this is some comments by a guy who's done other types of leaks before

402
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:28,980
and also is a modder for various games. I don't know how to pronounce their name. Meteoros,

403
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,900
I guess, basically saying that the from my educated guess this is some source tree leak

404
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:41,220
from the PC version of the game to add support for Ubisoft Game Launcher slash DRM. It doesn't

405
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:48,900
contain it does contain some executables, but no Xbox code, no game assets. The code that is there

406
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:56,980
doesn't compile without 332 errors. So I think you need to get some debug PC version of the game

407
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:04,500
running or the put some effort and learn the code base. So no word what they're going to be able to

408
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,820
do with this, but maybe we'll see it ported to other things or maybe, you know, updated using,

409
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:18,500
you know, fancy ray tracing or something, who knows? Or you can just look at it. Because you can.

410
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,820
Yeah, that's that's what most people do with this stuff. They download the source code just be like,

411
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,500
Oh, that's neat. I have the source code. And then they open it up and look at the Wow, this is a lot.

412
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,740
Okay. Yeah, it's cool to like find out how people used to do things or how it was done before. And

413
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,180
you can always use it to like make mods or improvements to the original game.

414
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,540
Yeah, no, I was gonna say the the modders are probably the ones celebrating. Most of all,

415
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,180
it's it's probably the modders that are going to get the most use out of this because now it's

416
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,700
like, Oh, now we can really, I mean, but Far Cry, this this one that leaked is just doesn't have an

417
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,700
online component, right? Because Far Cry is I know some of them have online modes, like single

418
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:02,820
player. I don't remember. It was a while ago. I remember it had split screen on Far Cry primal.

419
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,940
No, it wasn't primal. What would they call that before? It was instinct. Far Cry instinct was the

420
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:15,300
Xbox version. That had split screen I remember, but I don't think I don't remember if it had

421
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:22,260
online. A bonds 006 clarifies it does not have online. So yeah, so I thought I thought so yeah,

422
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,180
because that's that's when the source code leaks on that stuff. That's when it gets you know,

423
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,700
really dicey because people are looking for the hacks, the exploits, all that stuff. So I get

424
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,580
that. And then Oh, yeah, this would be wouldn't be online now anymore. Anyways, even if it was

425
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,660
online at one point. I also like I I don't like I'm not sitting here like also like cheering this

426
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,540
because I understand for Ubisoft and the company and all that like it's it this is a even if it is

427
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,860
you know, one of the older games. It's still a gigantic pain in the ass. But it's also one of

428
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:54,820
those things where it's like, is the world going to end as a result? Are your profits going to

429
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:01,700
plummet as a result now? You know, go let the modders fuck around and find out and it is you

430
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:10,980
know, it is what it is. So quest buster and chat says that that was the one that had busted stealth

431
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,620
because all the enemies could psychically find you with their bullets, whether you were in the open

432
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,740
or hiding in a bush. Well, then that makes me think maybe people can go in and fix it kind of

433
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,820
like, you know, to do a throwback to something we were talking about earlier the et video game. Like

434
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,060
I remember just in the last month, there was, you know, a bunch of stuff on social media about

435
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:37,380
somebody released like a fixed version of et that basically turned et on the Atari 2600 into a

436
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,700
pretty decent game. That Yeah, I

437
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,060
remember there's like three fixes that they had for that that they implemented.

438
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,540
Yeah, well, it just it also made it you know, they had more than six weeks to do it. So they,

439
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,140
you know, were able to, you know, put some interesting things in the game, you know,

440
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,140
40 years of programming experience on top of that, you know, that would be the interesting thing

441
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,740
that could come out of this, you know, especially on top of what quest buster was saying there about

442
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,820
Oh, this had this whole broken mechanic. Well, somebody's probably going to go in there and fix

443
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,780
it. And now you're going to see like, the definitive far cry or the definitive fan far cry

444
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,580
or something because obviously, you can't, you know that if you want to stay from cry,

445
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,780
that would cry. I like that. Yeah, if you want to stay from Ubisoft's ire, you got to be careful

446
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,540
using, you know, those types of words, but fan cry, I like that, where they can, you know, fix

447
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:33,060
some of these things and make the game even better as a tribute. So as Joe and Matt also points out,

448
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,740
source code leak is just a few steps away from putting dicks in the game. Well, come on, that's

449
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,540
modders already do that. You don't need source code to do that. Matt, come on. Come on. And but

450
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:47,380
the bonds double six says I like the brokenness of far cry. Well, here's the good news. The source

451
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:53,300
code leaking does nothing to change the original. In fact, I bet it makes the original get ported

452
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,460
to more toasters and graphic calculators and refrigerators like that's that's that's what

453
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,060
happens when like the doom source code is published for all the download is that Oh, we gotta

454
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:10,660
now we got to put this game on literally everything. So that's what you can look forward

455
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:20,980
to a far cry graphing calculator far cry. All right. Well, speaking of other games with, you

456
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,300
know, graphical technology, that's probably not much better than a graphing calculator.

457
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:32,020
We have some updates on Pokemon sleep, and what all is going on with Pokemon sleep. So

458
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:40,500
Pokemon sleep is happening. It's coming later this year. Excuse me later this month,

459
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,980
actually. And now we just got a gameplay trailer to come out. We don't have the exact date yet.

460
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,580
We know it is coming out in late July. But it's also important to point out this isn't

461
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:56,660
really a game. It's just something that is involving Pokemon that will hook up with things

462
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:02,340
like Pokemon go and assumably, whatever Nintendo's mainline series have in store for

463
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:08,340
Pokemon. So what happens with this, you get paired with a Snorlax, and you increase your bond with

464
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:14,980
Snorlax by sleeping. And if you get a good night's sleep, Snorlax will get drowsy power from you.

465
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:23,220
And then more Pokemon will visit and you'll get rare sleep styles. I think this is just a virtual

466
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,780
collection of sorts. When your sleep style decks is filled up with all these different Pokemon,

467
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,820
hooray, you caught them all. Congratulations. You can also increase your bond with Snorlax with

468
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:40,100
berries and drinks and all that. But yeah, it does seem interesting that maybe the sleep tracking

469
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:45,460
capabilities are actually going to be pretty well rounded in the games. Your phone's microphone and

470
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:50,580
accelerometer will actually see how much you toss and turn in your sleep or even record your snoring

471
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:56,660
if that's something you want to listen to. If you toss and turn all night, you might get Togepi

472
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:02,740
will actually come out and sing its rocking sleep style. If you snore, Jigglypuff will try to sing

473
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:09,540
you to sleep. This is very silly, but okay. You want me to have nightmares?

474
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:14,260
Yeah. If you put the Pokemon- I keep dreaming about Pokemon. I don't know why.

475
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,500
I want to know which Pokemon shows up if you put the app down to record your sleep,

476
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,540
and then the bed starts rocking rhythmically. We don't know what Pokemon comes out to-

477
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,020
Or if you're having a really good time, Dugtrio. All right.

478
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,220
But anyway.

479
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,820
You did not go there.

480
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:48,100
I bought a house there. I pay a mortgage there. Anyway, that is the- yeah, Pokemon. Also,

481
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:53,780
you can get this if you want to pair this up with the Pokemon Go Plus bracelet. You can sleep track

482
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:00,340
that way as well. Yeah, it's $30 if you really want that. But good news, the Pokemon sleep app

483
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:07,540
is free because it's mining all of your sleep data for later use. I don't know what companies

484
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,580
need with your sleep data, but I bet it's very interesting to know what time the average Pokemon

485
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,940
player goes to bed and wakes up. I mean, it's just- it's interesting. So yeah, and Darktosea

486
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:23,540
does say the snoring recording might be useful for a doctor. Yeah, but I do want to be clear,

487
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,860
there are other apps out there that are not Pokemon-branded that will do very,

488
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,420
very similar things if that is something you're interested in.

489
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,100
I just wish that there was like a cute little app like that that I could have used instead

490
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,780
of having all of that goo put in my hair to attach the wires to my head when I had

491
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:45,380
my narcolepsy test. Oh, yeah. That was- that shit did not come out. It was terrible.

492
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,060
All right, moving on. We have a lot of good retro stories tonight,

493
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:57,300
and I think this is another one. Jamie? Yeah, so you know, we have a love of laser

494
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,660
discs in my house, and we're big fans of some of the laser disc games, you know. And Taito put out

495
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:10,020
a few that we got two- I know we got two of them on the Sega CD, but there is, of course,

496
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:16,100
a third one that's going to be added to those other two in a collection, which is the Taito

497
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:23,940
LD game collection. And one of them- I'm sorry, if you've hung out with me or are old or know your

498
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,900
anime history, you will know this other name, but the first two- there's Time Gal, which we did get

499
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:37,780
on Sega CD, Revenge of the Ninja, which we also got on Sega CD, I played the crap out of,

500
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:44,100
and Space Battleship Yamato. For the record, for those who do not know, who are also old,

501
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:54,660
we got this in the early 80s, late 70s, was it, as Star Blazers. Even had the same music for-

502
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:00,180
pretty much the same theme song. I mean, like, it was pretty much word for word translation,

503
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:08,260
but anyway. So, but anyway, these were all games that were originally on laser discs.

504
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,780
And if you don't know what laser discs are, get off my lawn.

505
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,940
Basically, if you know how big a record album is, you know what record albums are,

506
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:24,020
because now they're what the cool kids use. They were, like, giant CD in that size,

507
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,260
and you put them on, and they were double-sided, and, you know, if you were watching a movie on it,

508
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:33,700
you'd probably have to get up and flip the disc unless you had, like, a double-sided reader or

509
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:45,060
something. And then, but anyway, with this, it's basically, you would play on your- well,

510
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,900
in the arcades, you would, of course, have a joystick or a button that you would either

511
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,540
press in a direction when you got a visual clue, or hit a certain button, again, with a visual

512
00:49:53,540 --> 00:50:00,740
clue. And you could watch and participate in a story, and there's only one right answer,

513
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:09,700
usually, in these games. There were other ones that came out. I mean, there was- Lupin,

514
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,780
Castle of Cagliostro came out as a game called Cliffjumper. Do you remember that?

515
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,300
I don't think so.

516
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,100
Yeah. But anyway, these are all three of them. I mean, for laser disc games, you're pretty good,

517
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,860
pretty neat little stories. I mean, Time Gal, I didn't play a whole lot of,

518
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:32,660
but I did play a lot of Revenge of the Ninja. And so, this is going to be out on Switch, and

519
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:43,220
I'm trying to see, because I had the date here a second ago. It was on Taito's announcement page,

520
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:49,860
I think, which is in Japanese, so let me see if I can find the date listed. It says December 14th,

521
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:59,540
2023. So yeah, hopefully we'll get it over here too. But yeah, I'm actually looking

522
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,020
forward to the Yamato one. I've never gotten to play that one.

523
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:02,900
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

524
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,820
Yeah.

525
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,180
All right, moving on.

526
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,740
Now the Yamato song is stuck in my head.

527
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,060
All right, well, while you hum that, Loki, what's next for us?

528
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:22,100
It's more stuff to come out of the whole Microsoft and Activision acquisition thing.

529
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:29,300
So this actually reveals some stuff about Sony. In the core filings, it mentioned that basically,

530
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:36,900
the PlayStation likewise sells a less expensive digital edition for $399.99 and is expected to

531
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:42,900
release a PlayStation 5 slim later this year at the same reduced price point. And then they also

532
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,540
have another comment in that filing as well saying the PlayStation, meanwhile, currently

533
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:53,140
offers two different versions of the PlayStation 5, one with a Blu-ray player for physical media

534
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:58,900
standard and one without digital and is anticipated to release further differentiated

535
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:06,260
pro and slim models in the near future. So is Microsoft leaking out that Sony has a pro and

536
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:12,180
slim version or is it just their speculation that they're including in this? Who knows?

537
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:20,980
But this is part of their document titled the console market must include Nintendo.

538
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,540
I don't know that I didn't really have anything to do with Nintendo,

539
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:29,380
but I guess includes all three consoles in there.

540
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,860
Well, but not unexpected.

541
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,940
Yeah. And, you know, obviously, you know, some people have been trying to discount

542
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:45,540
Nintendo and this is not being high end because, you know, it's including Nintendo or not

543
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:50,100
as a competitor makes a big deal in these, you know, anti-competition sort of things. Right.

544
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:56,820
So yeah. Yeah. Well, boy, but we we're really not going to hear the end of this for some time.

545
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:01,540
That's for sure. With the court cases. Or do we know? Do we know if there's an end date on

546
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:07,300
the court case? I guess. I don't know. I know they had some dates for filings and stuff like that,

547
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,940
but I think it's still in the hands of the FTC right now.

548
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:18,420
Gotcha. All right. Well, moving on to oh, I can't believe this guy's back in the news,

549
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:23,140
but guess what? Peter Molyneux. We've got some news and updates on Peter Molyneux. I mean,

550
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:29,860
if you think about it, he's kind of he's been gone for a little while. You know, what's in the cube?

551
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,540
Remember that? That was 2012. That was over 10 years ago.

552
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:40,740
Just the headline. Headline is just it's just like it's so Peter Molyneux like seriously.

553
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:49,060
And then I believe he did the Trail Frontier challenge in 2017. But apparently now

554
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,700
he's back and coding a new game. But we don't know if this has anything to do

555
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,620
with blockchain gaming, because the last time we heard from this guy,

556
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:05,380
it had to do with blockchain gaming. But he's coding a new game and apparently say this the

557
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,660
first time that he is coding something since black and white, that he's actually in there

558
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:18,900
coding it himself. So that's kind of interesting. Apparently, it's some all new mechanic. So he says

559
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,580
in days gone by, I would just start telling you about the whole game and the whole game design

560
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,340
and why it was going to be the most brilliant game in the world. I'm not going to do that.

561
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:35,220
But he did say this mechanic will be part of a familiar environment, more like kind of a fable

562
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:40,580
black and white Dungeon Keeper kind of experience. So this is sounding like another medieval type of

563
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:47,860
game. Could be interesting. This is going to be a plan for PC and consoles first, which is

564
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,100
a departure from 22 cans who made what's in the cube and all that stuff because that was designed

565
00:54:52,100 --> 00:55:02,180
around smartphones, as you may recall. So yeah, this is I mean, I guess going to be interesting.

566
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:08,580
I'm glad he knows to just kind of shut up for the moment. But we'll see. Yeah, does he though. So

567
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,580
we'll see how long he can actually do that. So we have some more information on the actual game.

568
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:19,540
Yeah, I just I don't know. Like, it feels like though he's still trying to tease it in a way

569
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:24,500
like he did before. No, he never did come out and tell us what like everything was. He would always

570
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,460
like, mull over like a specific point that was going to be revolutionary and never seen before,

571
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:36,340
but it always wasn't. So like, I don't know. I don't believe anything he says.

572
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,260
I mean, the cube thing was funny for a minute, but only because it was like meme people were

573
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,900
drawing dicks all over the cube because that was you put you poke at the cube and everybody else

574
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,580
is poking into the cube too. And so if you find your little corner, you could poke dicks and boobs

575
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,740
and all the things you're not supposed to be drawing on a you know, shared canvas around the

576
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,660
world. But this is what it is. And whatever happened with like the profits that they were

577
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,340
supposed to getting from that one game where they supposed to be sharing profits or something like

578
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,220
that or something. I thought there was a whole like profit share thing with that where what

579
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:17,540
profits that would have the game making a profit. It's like, actually, actually, you you get to pay

580
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:24,100
the debts that we have. You're a winner. You win. And now sit here at this table and pay the bill

581
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:31,300
while the rest of us leave the restaurant. All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.

582
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:39,940
Well, I'm Super Mario RPG, you know, we're getting we're getting the the remake, right?

583
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,100
Supposed to be out on November 17, a game I can get excited about. Yes.

584
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:53,620
Right. Well, the original director Fujioka Chihiro is actually not involved in it,

585
00:56:53,620 --> 00:57:00,340
but he's really looking forward to playing it. And he's quoted as even saying, I am very surprised

586
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:08,660
and pleased with the news. And of course, he's been excited for how many people have been thanking him

587
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:18,660
for it. But good news is that one of my favorite game composers, Shimomura Yoko is returning to

588
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:28,180
do the music. Yeah. So she also did Kingdom Hearts. A lot of Kingdom Hearts stuff, too.

589
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:34,420
So I am. I think it's going to be all right. I'm feeling like it's going to be good.

590
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:41,060
So I didn't talk about it in my gaming week, but since Alan was at Costco yesterday, I said,

591
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:46,580
Hey, I'm going to Venmo you $90. And I want you to get me the $100 of Nintendo gift card thing.

592
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:54,740
So he did. And I use the I got the voucher today on Nintendo online. So I did buy Zelda Tears of

593
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,620
the Kingdom. I just haven't played it yet. And I'm gonna put the other I put the other voucher

594
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:06,660
on the Mario RPG pre order. So I have I got both those games for 45 bucks a pop as opposed to

595
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,340
70 for Tears of the Kingdom. So extreme couponing. I love it.

596
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:20,500
But yes, fantastic. It is. Don't forget that is a trick. I'm not sure who else. I mean, I don't

597
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,500
want to just only endorse Costco. I don't know if there's other stores that offer a similar deal.

598
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:30,820
Costco, you can get 90 or you can get $100 worth of Nintendo bucks for 90 bucks. And then you go

599
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:36,100
and you spend that 100 bucks on the two vouchers and bam $45 games, you could still use them like

600
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:41,060
if you already bought Tears of the Kingdom as I imagine most of you did, you could still use them

601
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:45,380
on the two Mario games coming out and it would stay like Mario wonder and Mario RPG, which I

602
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,460
imagine a lot of you are probably going to get and you would still save money and Pikmin four

603
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,700
is eligible to and there's other games too. I think Wario aware is eligible to but Wario

604
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:59,940
aware is only a $50 game anyway. So it is interesting. The prices they're charging for

605
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:04,820
some games versus others just please just promise me promise me everyone. You're not going to use a

606
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:11,780
voucher on everybody one to switch. Don't don't do that. Don't do that. Please don't buy that game.

607
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:19,380
There you go. Quest buster and chat says Tears of the Kingdom is so good. Lots to explore and do.

608
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,220
It's already one of my top games for this year. And I can't see in chat says,

609
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,220
let us know when you do play Zelda. I want to hear your take. Yeah, I'll probably stream it.

610
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:34,100
Honestly, I'm curious about it for sure. So all right, let's move on. Loki.

611
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:42,340
Yes. So we talked about last week how Val was going to be taking down some games that had AI

612
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:49,620
generated stuff in them. Well, they kind of walked back a little bit. Basically making a

613
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:56,180
statement it to Polygon said that they didn't really have they have no desire to discourage

614
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:04,100
the use of AI in games development. But, you know, suggest that perhaps existing copyright laws

615
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:09,220
might do the job for them when it comes to AI created assets. They said the introduction of AI

616
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:15,620
sometimes makes it harder for or harder to show a developer has sufficient rights to use AI to

617
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:21,380
create the assets, including images, text and music. In particular, there are some legal

618
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:28,740
uncertainty related to the data used to train AI models. There's lots of lawsuits. Sarah Silverman,

619
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:35,300
for example. Yeah, I just heard about that today. Yeah. It is the developer's responsibility to

620
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:40,500
make sure that they have the appropriate rights to ship their game. Basically, it's the developer's

621
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,740
responsibility to cover their ass because we're not going to cover their ass. And if it comes down

622
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:50,500
to them suing us, we're going to point them in your direction type of thing. We know it's

623
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,340
constantly evolving tech and our goal is not to discourage the use of it on Steam. Instead,

624
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:59,540
we're working through how to integrate it into our already existing review policies.

625
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,820
Stated plainly, our review process is a reflection of the current copyright law and policies

626
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:11,140
and not an added layer of our opinion. As these laws and policies evolve over time,

627
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:17,860
so will our process. Well, I mean, it's interesting that they are having to kind

628
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:22,500
of respond to this in real time as the world is figuring this thing out. And like you said,

629
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:27,060
now the litigation, something we didn't really bring up last week, because I know we got really

630
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:32,100
into it last week on this discussion, but now we're seeing the litigation side of this. And

631
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:36,100
now that we have Sarah Silverman, it's not just her, there's like two other authors that are

632
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,580
suing. And if you haven't heard of this, basically, because they're alleging that

633
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:46,580
chat GPT and some of the open platforms were trained off of their books, and they proved it

634
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:52,580
by going to the sites and basically saying, can you summarize the book? And it's giving like

635
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:58,260
excerpts straight out of the book, basically. And so they were like, this is copyright infringement,

636
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,460
essentially. Well, it's I think, am I getting it right?

637
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:07,700
Potentially, it's copyright. Well, that's the law, the lawsuit alleges copyright infringement,

638
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:12,020
right? That could, it could be also to like, I mean, that's going to be a case they're

639
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,740
going to have to make. Because if it's looking to summarize it, it could be looking at reviews

640
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:22,820
of a book by other people. And if they cite quotes in those reviews, then essentially,

641
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:27,620
it's taking quotes from those books, but it may not even be looking at those books. Also, if it

642
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:35,860
can, you know, scrape the web, it may be able to pull excerpts from, like samples of the book,

643
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,620
you know, if you have an e book, you may put out a few chapters or, you know,

644
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:46,500
a small section of it to give the readers an idea of what it looks like. And so yeah, I mean,

645
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,340
I don't know, it's gonna be something they have to prove. At least it wasn't them going,

646
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:55,220
did you write this? Or, you know, is did you get this from this, you know, because the AI doesn't

647
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:00,820
know it'll make up stuff all the time. Yeah. Um, you know, and this isn't the only hot button

648
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:05,940
thing going on with AI in gaming this week. I know on social media, there is a lot that happened just

649
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,020
because I am fortunate enough through the panels I've done over the years and stuff. I have friends

650
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,300
that are voice actors that were kind of joining in this debate that was going on, I believe she

651
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:19,620
was a voice actress with persona five, but she ultimately ended up taking a break from social

652
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:24,020
media just because people were being miserable to her as people on social media tend to do or let's

653
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:27,700
say Twitter, it's Twitter. Because I don't I don't see the same shit on blue sky. That's for

654
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:37,060
sure. It's fucking Twitter. So um, and it was about that somebody used AI and her voice to get

655
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:44,580
her to sing a song as one of her characters, but it was the AI as her voice. And she's like, don't

656
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:49,940
hell no. Yeah, she's like, don't fucking do that bass. I'm extremely paraphrasing. But she say,

657
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,060
don't fucking do that. And my friends that are voice actors are also chiming in. Don't fucking

658
01:03:55,060 --> 01:04:01,140
do that. And I as a podcaster would also like to chime in. Don't fucking do that with our podcast

659
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,940
and all that stuff. Because a joke had come up earlier in Bobby's chat room. And I know it's a

660
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,420
joke. It's whatever. But you know, they were they were saying, Oh, we could do a Bobby Black Wolf AI

661
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:15,780
show because he's out tonight and all that stuff. And yet, no, it's cute as a joke. But the problem

662
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:22,500
is a joke either. Well, well, it's not cute as a joke, because over here behind door number two,

663
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:29,940
we have the legit legit issue that this actress is raising. And this also leads to now the other

664
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:38,740
concern. If AI can perfectly replicate these voices, will the voice actors be called for

665
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:45,060
these different projects? By the way, this all is why a bit why shouldn't say the only reason why

666
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:52,340
but a big sticking point in why the Writers Guild is striking, and the Actors Guild Screen Actors

667
01:04:52,340 --> 01:05:01,860
Stage Guild is about to strike its AI and the rights to, you know, use AI, or in some cases,

668
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:09,540
Hello, Indiana Jones, D age them, or Star Wars, or many of these other things. Now, I believe,

669
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:14,260
especially in the case of Indiana Jones, where the actor is in the film, they had the person's

670
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:22,180
permission to do things. But what if they didn't? You know, or what if could they say by starring

671
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,940
in this, you have given us the right to do that sort of thing? I think there have been some legal

672
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:30,340
issues that have come up with this previously. But still, it's just it's all of this is like,

673
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:35,620
this is this is really coming to a head with AI. And like, what are the ethical ways you can use

674
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:39,460
it and not and again, and I think this kind of lends into something we were talking about last

675
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,020
week, it's going to be about how do you train it? What's the information that you're giving it?

676
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:48,740
If it's your own information for your own purposes? All right, then. But if it's, you know,

677
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:56,500
books, podcasts, anime, anime vocal songs, and things that you did not give permission for it

678
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,300
to learn off of, it's not okay. It's copyright infringement.

679
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:07,460
And you know, though, there's going to come in like, how to like, I'm going to throw this out

680
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:14,260
there. So say that they wanted to do a Rocky and Bullwinkle revival. Is June Faure's estate

681
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:22,660
going to allow her voice to be used? You know, or, you know, so and so, you know, deceased actor,

682
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:30,580
you know, is it in general, is it ethically okay to raise the dead to make money off of them?

683
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:35,380
But coming back to a point that was made on the show last week, if they bring somebody else in

684
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:40,660
to impersonate June Faure, then that's different. You know, and that actually happens a lot where

685
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:44,980
you bring somebody else in the kind of sounds like the deceased or otherwise departed actor.

686
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:49,220
You know, that happens all the time. That's that is a completely different thing. I mean,

687
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:54,260
for in some cases, especially if the voice actor did not come back due to a contract

688
01:06:54,260 --> 01:07:00,180
dispute or something, it might come off as tacky, but it is a completely different situation than

689
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:09,780
this. For sure. So quick, break man says quick, someone make a Rocky pull or scroll off the

690
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,380
screen. Sorry. Quick, someone make a polar rabbit from a hat joke. Yes.

691
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,260
You see me quoting the whole rest of it. I know. I know. I know.

692
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:22,100
That trick never works. So I do want to put on the sleeve.

693
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:25,780
I do want to point out, though, as much as we're all sitting here going, yeah,

694
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:29,540
this shouldn't happen with this particular voice actors. I want to remind people,

695
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:33,700
she deactivated Twitter and all this stuff took social media great because people were

696
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:39,060
bullying her from the perspective of, no, we should get to do this. It was just in fun.

697
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:43,140
It was a fan project. It was an excuse, excuse, excuse, excuse.

698
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:48,900
But people said, no, the implications. Yeah. And she said, no, that should be enough.

699
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:57,140
Yeah. Do not consent. End of story. What if this had been, what if this had been, um,

700
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,500
and I'm going to add actually in, cause I do think a bit of sexism has to do with,

701
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,180
it would have been a male actor, voice actor. If he said no,

702
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,260
probably would have been gotten the same level of flack.

703
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:14,180
The backlash. Yeah. I think, I think you're right. The backlash would not be as intense.

704
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:22,900
Anyway. Um, yeah. And break man is talking about movies, bringing actors back to life again.

705
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:26,180
You know, if they have the permission from the estate and all that it's different. Uh,

706
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:31,380
break man says concerts with dead musicians, you know, the, the Tupac hologram, did they have Tupac

707
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:35,940
estates consent? If they did then whatever I'm assuming they had to have, um, or the,

708
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,820
I think of the ABBA hologram show. Well, ABBA participated in the making of that. They were very,

709
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:45,140
they did that so that they wouldn't have to tour. So they absolutely support it.

710
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:50,580
Again, that's different. That's using the technology and stuff in good ways and ways that,

711
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:55,220
you know, are fine. It's these things that are unethical. Gorillas.

712
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:03,780
Tried to do a concert and that all failed. They did it. The Grammys, I think. Yeah. And then when

713
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:11,380
Madonna came out, her bass was so loud that it made the, uh, holograms vibrate. Yeah. Yeah.

714
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:18,100
All right. Uh, moving on. Um, let's talk about, Oh, some not so great news out of Niantic,

715
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:23,780
which is, you know, I, I said plenty about this last week, but now on top of this,

716
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:28,260
this week, they are being accused of a systemic sexual bias in a lawsuit.

717
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:32,900
A former Niantic employee who was laid off as part of the layoffs that happened,

718
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,860
that we were reporting about on the show has now filed a lawsuit against Niantic alleging

719
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:43,220
that a devalued the work of female employees and women of color denied equal pay to women employees

720
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:48,900
and women of color. Uh, the lawsuit is going for a clash action status. So right now it's being

721
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:54,020
raised by one individual, but they are looking to make it class action. And they use the term

722
01:09:54,020 --> 01:10:00,020
boys club, uh, throughout the lawsuit. Uh, again, that employee was laid off. Um, but they are,

723
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:06,100
and they are coming forward as an anonymous Jane Doe. Uh, all we know in the, uh, uh, lawsuit is

724
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:11,220
that they are, uh, Asian female who worked at Niantic in February of 2020. Oh, what a heck of

725
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:16,580
a start date. They're, uh, considering everything to happen. They started with a salary of 70 K.

726
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:22,980
And then later that year they were promoted to get about 84 K. But then in 2021, she learned

727
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:28,180
that a male colleague was making more money, even though she had a higher job title and more

728
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:34,260
responsibilities than he did. Allegedly that employee was being paid 127 K per year, and she

729
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:39,140
was being paid 105 K per year. So I don't know, I guess maybe that's a year later or whatever,

730
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:44,980
despite being a job level higher. And then around spring of 2023, she received a raise to 115 per

731
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:51,700
year, still below the male colleague. Now, I don't want to discount the argument here.

732
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:57,780
There are still some question marks with this because I have heard of these situations where

733
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:01,700
people get paid different because like experience or whatever, but I also don't want to discount

734
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:06,900
this person's concerns. It'll come out in a courtroom. We'll see what happens. I'm curious

735
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:12,660
to see, will others join on to the lawsuit as well? Because that's going to be telling,

736
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:19,140
again, it's just the reality. When it's one person, well, could there be a specific situation

737
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,660
or something going on? But then when it's multiple people complaining of the same thing,

738
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:27,060
well, you can't say it's an individual situation now at that point because it's affecting

739
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,900
multiple people and whatever's going on. Because apparently then it gets to this whole thing about

740
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:38,580
the employee discussed the concern with female staffers, sexism and equal pay were brought up

741
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:44,020
with the group Wolfpack, which is the employee resource group for women. But then when the

742
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:48,420
employee went to Niantic's diversity, equity and inclusion director and principal people partner,

743
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:53,780
they had made clear that they and male upper management Niantic were hostile to her complaints

744
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:58,900
or voiced concerns about sexism or sexual bias in the workplace. And then they said the job

745
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:05,220
evaluations, allegedly the job evaluations were affected by her discussing the workplace issues

746
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:10,100
with her colleagues and said that she was paid below the range because she raised the concerns

747
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:14,900
with her colleagues. And that's illegal. That is absolutely illegal. And on top of that,

748
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:19,940
if any company ever tells you that you can't discuss your pay, they're full of shit.

749
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:24,100
Right. You should discuss your pay. It should be open and honest for everybody.

750
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:30,020
But I will still be very curious to hear their side of it because the way you do it could still

751
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:36,180
be open to, you know, whatever, you know, obviously, things are not good at Niantic.

752
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:40,580
And I can't you know, this story coming out as one of those like, of course, because this is

753
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:44,900
a problem in our industry, right? We've we've learned that since the Activision Blizzard

754
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:49,860
lawsuit, it is not unique to just Activision Blizzard, it was certainly exacerbated in that

755
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:56,020
whole situation. But this is a problem that you know, permeates our industry. I will just be very

756
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:03,060
interested to see, is it just one or is it much more? You know, because again, the individual

757
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,860
concern and that whole debate kind of goes out the window when now five women come forward and say,

758
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:12,420
Yeah, this is a systemic problem. So we'll see. Anyway,

759
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:21,220
And the other thing too, is that it's there's a whole bunch of other just bullshit behind it.

760
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:28,500
Where I have it all in my head, and it's really hard for me to put this in words.

761
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:37,060
But there also is this societal bias, regardless that people are constantly having to fight

762
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:47,060
against. And people are way too quick to dismiss a woman's claim anyway. You know, like, Oh,

763
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:54,020
just being sensitive or blah, blah, blah, this, or, you know, need to just suck it up or whatever.

764
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:59,940
No, no. Talk about it. And if you are in a situation like this,

765
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:09,460
and you feel that you're not making what you're worth, I mean, bring it up and protect yourself,

766
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:12,580
save a paper trail of who you talk to and what you talk to them about.

767
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:17,620
Yeah. And I want to be clear. I'm not just, yeah. And I want to be clear. I'm not dismissing this

768
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,540
woman's complaints. I'm just curious what's going to come out in the courtroom. I'm curious to hear

769
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:25,220
the other side of it. That's all. Well, I know you wouldn't be like that. Yeah. But

770
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:34,340
the biggest thing is just, you know, give, give, give the person some credit because they wouldn't

771
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:38,820
say something if it hadn't happened. Yeah. At least that's, that's always my theory.

772
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:47,700
Yeah. All right. All right. Well, let's, let's take a moment to take a trip down memory lane in

773
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:54,580
an age long before AR gaming companies. We're going to take a trip down memory lane in our next

774
01:14:54,580 --> 01:15:10,980
segment right now. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the

775
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:17,140
vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

776
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:25,140
And what is that game this week? Oh, gosh. The game this week is forgotten worlds.

777
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,820
I was a little bit surprised that I hadn't done it. I had, you know,

778
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,500
it's sort of like these days, if it's something I haven't done, I'm like,

779
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:40,820
when did I not do this? Why haven't I done this? Excuse me. What planet am I on right now? But this

780
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:50,820
was indeed one that I had not done. So we're, we're going to discuss some classic game tonight.

781
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:58,420
So forgotten worlds is or as it was called in Japan, lost worlds is a side scrolling shooter

782
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:08,100
by Capcom. It was originally released as an arcade game in 1988. And it's notable for being the first

783
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:17,060
title for being released on Capcom's CP system. So is basically set in the 29th century where

784
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:26,100
this evil god known as Bios has fucked up the earth. And now it's called the dust world. And

785
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:34,740
so super soldiers are made by these people scientists to defeat Bios and the eight evil gods

786
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:43,780
and like, sort of like sci fi fantasy ish. So anyway, it can be played by up to two players

787
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:54,820
simultaneously. And it's a, it's an interesting little kind of game. So basically, one player

788
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:01,940
can control one of the muscle soldiers with a rifle with unlimited ammo, you're equipped

789
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:07,940
with long range automatic rifle, and then player two has a short range wide shot. So

790
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:14,900
you got an eight way joystick in the arcade and a roll switch, which is this rotatable button.

791
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:21,700
So if you rotate it, it allows you to adjust where your character is aiming in one of 16 directions.

792
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:30,580
And so you can pretty much rapidly change your direction anywhere. And also if you

793
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:36,660
press the switch button, you know rapidly, then you have a mega crush attack that destroys

794
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:44,740
anything on screen, but it also takes part of your life to do so. You have a little module that

795
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:52,020
goes with you, that's your backup firepower. And it can be rotated as well with the roll switch.

796
01:17:53,540 --> 01:18:00,340
So if you rotate the character, while fighting will only rotate the aim of the satellite,

797
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:05,700
but rotating the character without firing, rotates the satellites aim and also its relative

798
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:10,740
position around the player. So you can also get these blue colored coins called zenny,

799
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:16,900
because I guess video games like zenny as a currency from defeating enemies. It's used to

800
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:22,580
buy power ups from shops that are in different areas in each stage. And then you're given a

801
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:26,980
choice of whatever item is available and limited time to make your purchase. So you can get new

802
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:35,140
weapons for your satellite, but you also get health kits for vitality and even tips on how

803
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:45,060
to defeat the bosses in the stage. So it has nine stages, each with its own boss and you will lose

804
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:53,860
your vitality gauge. If it runs out, then you also get a good chance to continue. So the game itself

805
01:18:53,860 --> 01:19:01,220
took two years to develop and had a production budget of five million dollars, which as of 2022

806
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:09,300
would have been about 12 million dollars and had four megabytes of sprite data. And it started off

807
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:17,460
as like a normal side scrolling shooter, but Okamoto Yoshiki wanted a very imaginative game.

808
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:25,220
And so Capcom tried to make it easier to play because it was really hard to dodge at first.

809
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:31,060
But Capcom also really wanted to show up the capability of the CPS-1.

810
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:37,220
It didn't really make a lot of money because there were a bunch of shooters on the market

811
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:45,300
and it also made increase in different expenses because of the shortage of chips needed for the

812
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:54,100
CPS-1 boards. It was first ported to home computers in Europe by U.S. Gold in 1989.

813
01:19:54,100 --> 01:20:01,700
There were versions for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC,

814
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:14,580
TurboGrafx-16, and IBM compatible PCs. It was later, those versions were developed by

815
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:26,260
Ark Developments and they had four months to make the conversions. So they were okay.

816
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:36,500
Basically, they had to redraw everything from, well, a few things from hand. The shop was done

817
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:48,260
by hand and the computer aspects were redrawn with deluxe paint and the frames were digitized

818
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:56,660
from the arcade's version with this DigiView Gold device. So they tried. They all needed a

819
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:01,540
joystick to play. Could not be played with a keyboard except for the IBM PC versions,

820
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:08,100
ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC versions. You rotated the character by holding the fire button

821
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:17,620
while pushing the joystick. But it did okay. The ZX Spectrum sales, it was number two behind Robocop

822
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:26,740
which was pretty much number one for the entire year. So there was a Mega Drive Genesis version

823
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:32,980
produced by Sega that was released in Japan November 18th 1989 and had subsequent releases in

824
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:42,340
North America and Europe. They tried really to simulate the controls by having the A and C buttons

825
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:48,580
do the rotation and the B button for shooting. But they made sure that both characters had the

826
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:56,900
long-ranged automatic rifle and only seven of the nine stages were ported in and had an auto

827
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:03,780
fire feature. In 2008, the Mega Drive version was released on Wii Virtual Console in North America

828
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:12,580
and in Europe after that. There was a Master System version that came out in Europe and Brazil

829
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:19,860
because we know how they love the Master System in Brazil. It's a one player only version and

830
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:28,980
the buttons on the system were just used for rotation and shooting was automatic. The

831
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:34,420
Mega Crush you would have to just press both simultaneously. The TurboGrafx-16 version was

832
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:44,180
produced by NEC Avenue and released in 1992 as a Super CD-ROM2 title that had a special three

833
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:50,900
button controller that NEC only released in Japan. There was an American version by Turbo Technologies

834
01:22:52,420 --> 01:23:00,900
and so basically it controlled very similar to the Mega Drive version. Now the run button on a

835
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:09,300
standard controller was used for the rotation but it was one player only. There was a version

836
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:16,100
planned for the Capcom Power System Changer but it didn't get released. There's an emulation of

837
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:24,500
the original version in the 2005 Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1 for PS2 and Xbox, 2006 Capcom

838
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:31,140
Classics Collection Remixed for PSP, and then Nintendo Switch and Capcom Arcade Stadium.

839
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:40,020
The PS2 and Xbox version will allow you to use the analog sticks to control your character's aim.

840
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:47,460
A 2008 Sega Mega Drive and Genesis version that came to the Wii of course it's

841
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:56,500
controlled as advertised. So it was as far as reception. The arcade version pretty much

842
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:02,740
got very positive reviews across the board. The home versions were also very positive but the

843
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:11,220
Master System one did not get as great reviews. I mean then again it's a very scaled down version

844
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:18,980
of the game. But the magazine Game Machine listed Forgotten Worlds on their September 1st,

845
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:26,500
1988 issue as the second most successful table arcade unit of the month. It outperformed Sky

846
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:36,740
Soldiers and Ninja Spirit. So at the 1988 Gamest Awards in Japan it received the Best Graphics

847
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:46,420
Award and the home computer versions were, like I said, very well received and got some internal

848
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:54,580
magazine rewards. So yeah, that is our game Forgotten Worlds or Lost Worlds, the first

849
01:24:54,580 --> 01:25:03,700
game released on Capcom CPS1. All right, I do remember this game vaguely. I know some of these

850
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:08,260
shooters from the 90s I don't always recall but this one I do remember playing.

851
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,620
This one was very unique.

852
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:14,740
Something about the space dragons and the dudes floating in the air with their little

853
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:19,140
sidekick spaceships. Yeah, it's very unique. It stands out.

854
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:25,220
It's the rotating element for it for me. I don't think anything else was doing that at the time.

855
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:32,980
So, and, and honestly, I kind of don't see them like even in retro arcades that much.

856
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:37,860
But if you find one in arcade, please take me a picture of it and tell me where it is.

857
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:42,580
The closest thing I could think of his life force but it's not even like the same,

858
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:50,980
you know, like forces salamander but but just Yeah, just like how novel that was when that

859
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,700
happened right so it's like kind of like the first step to that but yeah.

860
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,940
Anyway, good pick classic game of the week.

861
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:01,540
Break man that monsters poor abs he probably spent hours in the monster gym.

862
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:08,340
That I think that's just armor. I bet anything that he strapped into that armor and inside he's

863
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:16,180
like my skin is pushing into my spleen. And then after he explodes he's probably dying from relief

864
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:22,500
from having that tight armor taken off. I come up with head cannons. It's what I do.

865
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:28,420
All right. We'll see what head cannon you come up with for a classic game next week. But meantime,

866
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:33,940
we're gonna do some rap. Actually, that's that's what I that's, that would be a fun

867
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:38,980
year twist segment. Game that Jamie classic game that Jamie has rewritten the plot to

868
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:45,060
just be well that would be many games. Exactly. You could do a year full of that.

869
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:53,700
My whole rewrite of Mass Effect. My head cannons and the special head cannons for Dead by Daylight

870
01:26:53,700 --> 01:27:03,060
and and the Guardian legend where she's, you know, decides to flip everybody off and retire in Boca.

871
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:10,260
All right. Save it for the segments next year or the year after. All right. Moving on. Let's

872
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:15,620
check out some other headlines rapidly in a segment appropriately called rapid fire news.

873
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:24,260
Loki. Yeah, we have the new courses coming for Mario Kart eight deluxe next week. So

874
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:31,220
booster course pass five. And with that, of course, I think we talked about this when they

875
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:40,100
haven't attended direct. So Kamek is joining as well as Petey Piranha and Wiggler are three new

876
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:48,820
characters. Course wise, they're going to have the Cherry Cup, which has the Los Angeles track,

877
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:58,100
Sunset Wilds from Mario Kart Super Circuit, Koopa Kate from Mario Kart Wii, Vancouver Velocity from

878
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:04,900
also Mario Kart Tour. And then they also have the Feather Cup, which has Daisy's Cruiser from Mario

879
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:12,340
Kart Double Dash, Moon View Highway from Mario Kart Wii. They have the Athens Dash from Mario

880
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:21,540
Kart Tour and then the brand new squeaky clean sprint, which is that bathroom one. Looks cool.

881
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:30,100
And then, of course, we got another trailer for Mortal Kombat one, and they showed off smoke and

882
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:38,340
rain as, I believe, cameo characters. Oh, no, they're playable characters as well. And then

883
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:46,980
sector Cyrax frost scorpion as cameo fighters. Shaping up to be an interesting roster in game.

884
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:51,460
Um, I might check it out. We'll see. You know, I think those fatalities are like,

885
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,980
but now I don't know. There's a part of me that now I'm just kind of like, I can just

886
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:01,060
like, my brain can just shut off when that all happens. Like, that's kind of where I'm at at

887
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:07,700
this point. You know what I always hear in my head whenever I see a fatality? Like lately,

888
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:16,820
I hear you impersonating your mom. Rob, that's gross. Turn it off. People. Oh my God. Oh my

889
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:23,060
God. Rob. Yeah, pretty much. I literally do hear that in my head.

890
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:32,980
All right. Uh, what, what story do you have for us? Um, pole position. Anyway,

891
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:42,180
um, not to go into the theme song, but, um, there is a, another title coming to the arcade archives

892
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:50,340
in his pole position, um, which was released by Namco back in 1982. It will be on switch for July,

893
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:58,900
on July 26, 2023. Um, sorry on the sixth. So it's already out, um, for 7 99. Go get it.

894
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:06,260
Tell me how it is. Right. Um, something I think a lot of you already got that I just mentioned,

895
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:10,820
I got earlier today was the legend of Zelda tears, the kingdom. And I picked it up just

896
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:17,220
in time for the version 1.2 0 upgrade because the game got its, uh, I guess first major patch

897
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:22,020
this week. I don't recall another one having hit before. Uh, but you know, not that a ton

898
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:27,140
of things are like changed in the game, but there are a few things, uh, for one, uh, if you start

899
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:32,900
the game within certain articles released on a specific switch news channel, you can get a

900
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:37,700
number of in-game items. So it sounds like they built in the capability to get bonus items. If

901
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:41,460
you read a certain news article within switch, that's what it sounds like. Uh, it sounds like

902
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:46,020
they got some, uh, progression based bugs. So certain main quests were bugs and side

903
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:50,820
adventures were bugs. So they, um, updated all that in this, uh, some ferries sometimes

904
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:55,940
do not appear in certain conditions. So they fixed that, uh, the meals provided by Kiana and

905
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:01,620
Lurelin village, uh, now will not change. I guess it was preventing the change there or

906
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:07,140
they will change. They were not changing before. Yeah. Basically this is a bug fix patch and it's

907
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:12,340
nothing, you know, major, major, uh, but it's still nice to see that they are squashing all

908
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:17,220
them bugs because open world games tend to have a lot of them. So we'll see what the fans break

909
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:22,500
next in Zelda tears, the kingdom. All right, let's travel around the world and check out some games

910
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,500
you can pick up this week. If you are so inclined, uh, Loki, what's coming out in the U S.

911
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:35,460
So we've got a few things, uh, the valiant on PlayStation five and X-Box series.

912
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:41,780

916
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:10,420
Uh, the game that's playing behind me right now, gravity circuit on PC,

917
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:15,580
PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five. Toho

918
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,720

01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:25,840
actually a couple more exo primal on PC PlayStation four

920
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,040

three on PC. That's it.

922
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,660
All right, traveling over to Japan we have I don't think we

923
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:37,000

01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,680
Chronicles gets a release in Japan this week on the 13th. And

938
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:37,480
I think that is it for the switch. I'm trying to see if

939
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,000
there's anything that creeps into No, it doesn't look like

940
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,640

952
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,480
right. That's it. A few more stories for you and then we'll

953
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:43,080
get to any calls and other questions you all have in our

954
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,360
listener roundtable. But first some headlines from Loki.

955
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:49,560
Well, going back to what we were just talking about not that long

956
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:54,240
ago talking about AI voice generation. Well, there's still

957
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:59,520
more controversy because now people are using voices from the

958
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,400
voice actors in Skyrim to create dialogue for

959
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:09,520
pornographic mod. Oh, Jesus, that are on a nexus mod. So

960
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:14,040
they're just training it off of the voices in game so they can,

961
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,960
you know, have the different characters that they voice in

962
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,680
game do pornographic things and have the dialogue to go with it.

963
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,440
So, Nexus mod says AI generated mod content is not against our

964
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:30,400
rules but may or be may be removed if we receive credible

965
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:35,240
complaint from an affected creators slash rights holder is

966
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:40,560
nexus mods stance on that. There were some Twitter posts though,

967
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:46,000
basically trying to tag the different voice actors and Zen

968
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,040
amax in Bethesda to kind of give them a heads up because they're

969
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,760
not really doing anything.

970
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,760
Yeah, it should be the other way around. It should be that they

971
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,400
can only be published if they have the express consent. It

972
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,440
should not be waiting for a lawsuit or a complaint to come

973
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,120
in. It should be the other way around. Yeah. So

974
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,080
well, that's

975
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,640
I'm wondering though, if part of putting that disclaimer in is

976
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,440
for

977
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:18,800
ease of control. Because I mean, if you think about the number of

978
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,680
mods that go up on Nexus, yeah, daily,

979
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,200
no, it's it's it's

980
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,120
very well could be a logistic reason.

981
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,160
It's a YouTube approach, right? Like, you know, we're not taking

982
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,160
it down unless we get a copyright claim, that type of

983
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:35,200
thing. So it's just, but it's it's things like,

984
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,880
people should know better.

985
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:39,560
Yeah, it's things like this that are going to get the attention

986
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,600
of like, isn't Linda Carter in Skyrim? Or was she in Oblivion?

987
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,400
I know Patrick Stewart was in Oblivion, but isn't Linda

988
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:51,920
Carter in Skyrim? Like, if she's one of the voices, the OG

989
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,080
Wonder Woman, for those that aren't connected thoughts, I if

990
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,520
her voice is one of these, I can't imagine her estates could

991
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,480
be very happy about that.

992
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,160
Me, she

993
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,400
major loss.

994
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,400
That's exactly it. That's exactly it. You're already

995
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,680
seeing it with the Sarah Silverman thing. It's coming in

996
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,960
games to look at for like this situation, just you wait. Misha

997
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,160
chat says I saw something recently where Jennifer Hale

998
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,680
also stated she didn't want anyone using her voice for that

999
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:23,200
AI stuff either. I would imagine most people don't. And in a

1000
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:28,080
certain case by case scenario, they may allow like the de aging

1001
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:32,040
thing like you saw with Harrison Ford, who knew that that was

1002
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,680
going on with the Indiana Jones movie, or you know, the estate

1003
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,880
of Carrie Fisher when it comes to certain things that happened

1004
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,760
with Star Wars. But again, that's up to her estate and her

1005
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,920
heirs and people to control her likeness and all that to decide

1006
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:51,040
not for the movie creator, not for the fans to decide. So it's

1007
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,320
just, yeah. And Dr. Seuss says Yeah, indeed. I've heard quite a

1008
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,600
few voice actors speaking out against this. It's it's it as

1009
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,920
we're seeing I mean, and I brought it up earlier in the

1010
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,600
show too. It's as this gets more and more visibility. It's going

1011
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:08,240
to get more and more legal stuff. So just wait, just wait.

1012
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,920
Let's see Questbuster in chat says Patrick Stewart is in

1013
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,320
oblivion along with Sean Bean. Yeah, I know that I knew there

1014
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,040
were some big names.

1015
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,920
There's Sean Bean die in oblivion as well.

1016
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,040
Who doesn't? There's some big names.

1017
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,120
Oh no, it's Sean Bean. That's his thing.

1018
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:27,040
Oh, I can't see says Linda Carter's an ESO. Oh, maybe

1019
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,680
that's it. Maybe that's it.

1020
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:33,480
Yeah, they didn't mention any of those people in here. They had

1021
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:39,760
it's like about 15 different names on here. Or 18 different

1022
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,280
names, it looks like. But none of them.

1023
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:47,240
And SSJ 100 Mac is a great example of when permission is

1024
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:51,040
granted. As she says some actors like James Earl Jones

1025
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:54,800
approved their likeness and voice to be used via AI or deep

1026
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,280
fake stuff. So James Earl Jones said, Yeah, if you want to keep

1027
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,880
like, you know, because he's getting kind of old and probably

1028
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,280
can't do the voice the same way used to. So yeah, he gave

1029
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:07,280
permission. If they want to keep doing Darth Vader, they can use

1030
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,240
the technology to make it happen. But he gave permission.

1031
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:14,960
That's it. It's as simple as that. So yeah, he's he's in his

1032
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:18,400
90s now. It's not like even if he could do the voice, I don't

1033
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,960
well, but then you think about like, God, when when did June

1034
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,000
for a do magical dispel like that was she was in her 90s when

1035
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,200
that DuckTales reimagined came out. So

1036
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:32,960
oh, yeah. I mean, she she didn't stop until Yeah, her body gave

1037
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,240
out. But everybody's got their comfort. He was amazing. Yeah.

1038
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,440
And you know, we don't know. I hope and I wish that James Earl

1039
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,840
Jones is an excellent health. But I can't say that I know for

1040
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,040
sure that that is the case. So maybe he gets to a point where

1041
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:54,040
he can't Carol kept doing things too. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So all

1042
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:58,880
right. Moving on dark soccer, I guess finally, some closure of

1043
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,720
sorts on this story that came up a bunch over the last year.

1044
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:10,600
So um, so of course, um, as we know, Yuji Naka had been caught

1045
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:18,960
again for insider trading. But the judge Hirota Madoka had

1046
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:25,000
decided on a suspended two and a half year prison sentence

1047
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:29,800
deferred for four years. And there are also two fines that

1048
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:37,240
are equivalent of 1.1 million and $14,000 respectively. And

1049
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,560
that his actions hurt the quote fairness and soundness of the

1050
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,440
stock market while wounding investor trust. He did plead

1051
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,680
guilty for violating Japan's financial instruments and

1052
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:54,600
exchange act. And we don't really need to go over you know,

1053
01:40:54,640 --> 01:41:01,800
what he did again. Also, though, Sasaki Taisuke and Suzuki

1054
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:07,840
Fumiaki were also arrested for the same thing. But yeah, that's

1055
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,720
also Square Enix was working with investigators to try to

1056
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:17,280
catch people. But, you know, Yuji Naka, very, very, very high

1057
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:27,840
profile, and it's looking like even with the suspended sentence,

1058
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:33,080
it he may not actually serve real jail time, although two and

1059
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:38,200
a half years. That's not a long time. No, it's really not. I

1060
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:41,680
have a picture of Dan hanging out with him. Yeah. At E3.

1061
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,480
Yeah. So it's I don't know why I keep thinking of Martha Stewart.

1062
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,920
I mean, she didn't do a ton of jail time either. But you know,

1063
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,560
the whole insider trading thing. It's, um, it's interesting.

1064
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,000
Well, how many guys know?

1065
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,080
I know. I know. I'm happy that her brand is really recovered

1066
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,760
though. Like and name name a better Hollywood pair than

1067
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,960
Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg. You can't.

1068
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:10,920
I was just you can't you can't. And the thing is, is that, like

1069
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:15,360
for for her, she turned this shitty experience into sort of a

1070
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,000
money making parody event that and that's that's how you stick

1071
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,680
it to the man.

1072
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:23,920
But you know, the also the legal system in Japan is quite a bit

1073
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,800
different. I mean, basically, you have to prove you're

1074
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,760
innocent, not be proven guilty.

1075
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,640
Yeah, it isn't the fairest comparison. But it's the you

1076
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,320
know, the first thing that comes to mind is something a lot of

1077
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,880
people have heard of that was you know, also insider trading.

1078
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:42,840
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, no insider knowledge needed needed

1079
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,200
here because this news is everywhere. Loki.

1080
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:53,000
Yep. Game Pass Ultimate. The $1 deal is back. So you can now

1081
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
get that, which is pretty awesome. It's $1 for the first

1082
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
month. $17 for every month after that, unfortunately. But at

1083
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
least you get one month for $1.

1084
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,720
They want to get you hooked.

1085
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:09,520
It's Yeah, I gotta gotta get you hooked. It's Yeah, for first

1086
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,000
time users, of course. That's right. So.

1087
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,960
All right. Um, well, lastly, but not leastly tonight, I have

1088
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,280
a, I have a story about the Atari VCS. That's right.

1089
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:26,280
Remember, remember that. So let's talk about that. So Atari

1090
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:30,080
is teaming up with a company called play magic, which I play

1091
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,760
magic play magic, which I have not heard of, with something

1092
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:38,160
called the poly mega, which I have also not heard of.

1093
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:42,480
But apparently what this whole thing does, so sorry, I'm having

1094
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,680
a hard time getting this page to load here.

1095
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,640
I'm sorry, this is awkward.

1096
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,880
Okay, so what this is trying to do is that they're creating

1097
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,440
hardware and software integration between the poly

1098
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,720
mega, which is a disk supported system that plays ps one Sega

1099
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:07,680
Saturn Sega CD Turbo, which is a very, very popular system that

1100
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:11,760
plays CD Turbographic CD and Neo Geo CD games. It's all these

1101
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:16,640
systems as their, you know, copyrights and trademarks on the

1102
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:19,040
internal hardware technology, because I think they only last

1103
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,560
for 25 years. It's one of these like mega systems that plays all

1104
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,920
these things, right. And then there's also modules that will

1105
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,080
let you play cartridge games for the N64 SNES NES Sega Genesis

1106
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:33,600
Turbo graphics, again, a bunch of systems that you know, the

1107
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:39,280
stuff has expired some time ago. But the poly mega uses top tier

1108
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:43,760
emulation. And apparently it's only 90% compatibility though.

1109
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,960
So that's kind of interesting, but it will also load fan made

1110
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,280
patches to do HD graphics or translations or maybe fix some

1111
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,160
of these games. So it's kind of interesting. So if you're

1112
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:56,640
looking for a consolidated platform, this will now

1113
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:01,280
integrate with the Atari VCS. The Atari VCS will add support

1114
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:04,880
for the poly mega app and the poly mega remix add on. And so

1115
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,280
that means all of the functionality of a poly mega

1116
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:11,040
poly mega will come to Atari VCS owners. And in exchange, I

1117
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:16,240
believe the poly mega is getting some type of official Atari

1118
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:19,120
support with some of the Atari backlog of games that you know,

1119
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:23,520
come out all the time. So interesting, I guess, but you

1120
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,840
know, if you're like Dark Soccer and just own all the retro

1121
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,320
systems, you're probably like meh. But if you're somebody

1122
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,280
that's maybe exploring retro, you know, trying to build up a

1123
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,280
catalog, this might be of interest to you. Because you

1124
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,160
know, that's a heck of a lot of systems that this poly mega

1125
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:39,600
thing supports. But I'm not surprised. I mean, I feel like

1126
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,640
just five years ago, we were talking about like five in one,

1127
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:46,080
six in one, like these retron things, right, that just have

1128
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,160
all these cartridge slots. And now we're just seeing that

1129
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:53,520
expand to now the CD systems that the technology patents are

1130
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,160
lapsing and all this other stuff. So interesting.

1131
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,040
Dr. See, he says, I don't know if the VCS has a disk drive. I

1132
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,800
wonder how that's all going to work. I was kind of wondering

1133
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,960
that too. Like, do you but maybe if you hook it up to the actual

1134
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,640
poly mega, you can read it, but then I don't know why you just

1135
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,040
wouldn't play it off the poly mega. I don't know. Maybe it's

1136
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,400
because you can do the patching through the Atari VCS. I don't

1137
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,520
know. SG100 Matt in chat says kind of on topic. I wonder how

1138
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,520
ant stream is doing. They're still in business. I get emails

1139
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,200
I get emails from them. I will admit I am no longer a member.

1140
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,720
After my Kickstarter period expired, I kind of let it lapse.

1141
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:33,680
I wasn't really using it enough. But they I do get emails from

1142
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,960
them every now and again, that they like to announce like new

1143
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,280
games that they add to their service and things like that. So

1144
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:45,920
they're still chugging along. But I never really saw like them.

1145
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,040
I think the bummer about ant stream for me is that they never

1146
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:52,880
released to this day an Xbox series app as far as that maybe

1147
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,680
one came out and I missed it and that's completely possible.

1148
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,560
And maybe I need to reevaluate if that's the case. But yeah.

1149
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,800
Let's see. I was trying to see if I can actually a lot of

1150
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,880
tournaments are what I'm seeing from ant stream lately. So they

1151
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,840
do a lot of weekend tournaments and guides and things like that.

1152
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:17,680
I'm not seeing a lot of new games. I have to dig through

1153
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:22,400
their emails to see. But they're still around. I got a marketing

1154
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,200
email from them on June 2. So they probably send things on the

1155
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:27,280
first of the month or something like that, or first week of the

1156
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:31,680
month or something like that. Dr. Cs says I think ant stream

1157
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:34,880
is on the VCS. I'll have to log in again one of these days. I

1158
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,360
believe yes, they did have a partnership with ant stream on

1159
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,400
the VCS. Because I believe that's the only way you can play

1160
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,440
certain Atari games through ant stream is on the VCS. I think

1161
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,640
you get the entire catalog unlocked. If you are playing

1162
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,800
through the VCS. Whereas folks not on the VCS have a limited

1163
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,720
catalog or something like that. So but I know like Crystal

1164
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,400
Castles is one of the tournaments they were just

1165
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,160
promoting in their latest email. So they do have Atari games in

1166
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:02,960
their collection. But you know, I talked about this game last

1167
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,800
week. Atari 50 is a really decent collection of not just

1168
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:13,360
2600 games, but like 70 like your 5200 7800 Jaguar like it

1169
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,600
has a little bit of everything which is kind of neat arcade and

1170
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:20,800
all that stuff. So kind of neat. All right, well, with

1171
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,400
that, we will go to you all if you have any other if you have

1172
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,440
any other random thoughts like sj 100. Matt has or questions

1173
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:31,040
for us, please go ahead and voice those in chat. I'll also

1174
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,160
check in on the mailbag. I don't think there was anything but

1175
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:38,400
yeah, there was Oh, then I will go to participate at orange

1176
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,280
lounge rated calm is the place to send us an email. Oh, yeah,

1177
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,520
that's right. Because somebody had said in Discord, which by

1178
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,240
the way is at vog network.com slash Discord, somebody had

1179
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,880
said in there, did you close your mailbag and they were I

1180
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,600
think they were still sending it to the old old old address. So

1181
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,400
the the correct address again is participate at orange

1182
01:48:54,400 --> 01:49:00,560
entree.com. Go for it. Well, okay, so really vicious too.

1183
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,760
And one is from red entertainment. Hello, people. So

1184
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,560
I'm on threads. Now what? Stay care of entertainment. Okay,

1185
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:15,360
short and sweet. Congrats. threads. Interesting. Um, you

1186
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:19,040
know what? Obviously, I'm in support of anything that knocks

1187
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:22,560
Twitter down specific. Well, specifically, Elon Musk down a

1188
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,800
few pegs. Clearly not supporting Zuckerberg. Yeah, clearly,

1189
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,400
that's what this threads thing is doing. So in that I'm in

1190
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:34,000
support. But as dark soccer is referencing there, I completely

1191
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,680
understands people reservation with meta. And all that Oh, we

1192
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:40,800
just lost Loki. That's weird. I wonder if he lost internet at

1193
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,720
his house or something that doesn't know. There we go.

1194
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:47,440
That was a weird hiccup. Yeah, things happen. Um, but um,

1195
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:53,680
anyway, where was I sorry. Um, uh, oh, with the social media.

1196
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:56,720
So I completely understand the reservations about, you know,

1197
01:49:56,720 --> 01:50:01,120
meta and all that stuff. This is why I I personally am enjoying

1198
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:05,200
blue sky the most. But I also understand you have to have an

1199
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:08,080
invite to get on blue sky and they are still a little bit hard

1200
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:13,200
to come by. So yeah, you got to wait patiently handed out mine.

1201
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:20,720
You get one every two weeks. Also just FYI, if you are on Mac

1202
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:26,320
with an M series chip, you can run the blue sky app on your on

1203
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,080
your system. Just the one thing is don't push any of your own

1204
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,400
artwork on there if you don't want it to be used by AI.

1205
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,720
Hmm. Oh, because with the open platform stuff. Yeah.

1206
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:44,080
Uh, yeah. So, uh, yeah, I really enjoy blue sky personally,

1207
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,520
because I think this is what here it is, when you put blue

1208
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:51,840
sky next to threads, like I'm on threads, if you if you want to

1209
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:55,200
follow me and Mr. Rob Roberts, I feel like it's a very similar

1210
01:50:55,200 --> 01:51:01,120
situation to me for Twitter, is that I have to be there. Because

1211
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:05,200
if I'm not there, I'm not able to promote myself, which I know

1212
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:09,120
sounds really good. But the reality is, well, yeah, we all

1213
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,840
know it dark soccer promoting her twitch Loki promoting

1214
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:16,000
YouTube, me promoting a little bit of Twitch and the stuff I do

1215
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,800
IRL with hosting shows like the killer clowns thing we did

1216
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,040
yesterday. Are you a fan of killer clowns? Loki? Because I

1217
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:24,880
noticed you liking a bunch of course I should have had you

1218
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,120
come to the show. So I considered it but I had the kids

1219
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:32,960
and my wife was gone. It's like, it's a huge like schlocky

1220
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,920
cinema cult hit though. So I mean, they say anything about

1221
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,440
the upcoming game coming out. I was not able to stay for all of

1222
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:42,640
john masari concert, but he apparently had footage from the

1223
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:47,760
game in his concert that he was teasing. And they did say I did

1224
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:52,960
ask a question about, you know, if people want to support the

1225
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:55,760
sequel for killer clowns, you know, they want to see another

1226
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,800
one made, how can they support and a lot of them were like, you

1227
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,120
know, of course, it's about showing the money and the game

1228
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:03,680
is going to be a huge indicator of that. So please buy and

1229
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,840
support the game if you can was like a big thing they were

1230
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,880
talking about. So with that, so

1231
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,080
there's one other email. Oh, yes, go ahead. And it was just

1232
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,240
Brad sending me cats. Oh, no video game chatter for me

1233
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:21,280
tonight. But a while back, Jamie had put out the call for

1234
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,720
pictures of listener cats. So attached to four picks when

1235
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:27,840
each of my three kitties rose FEMA and the late great Clara

1236
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,880
Jane. And the fourth is Amelia formerly my kitty but now

1237
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,280
living the good life with another vogue supporter Sia

1238
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,920
Tabiri. Hope y'all have a great show Brad.

1239
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,360
I've I always have time for pictures with cats. Pictures of

1240
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:46,560
cats. I have pictures of your cats. You do you have cheddar

1241
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,960
or do I need to still send you chatter? I need more any

1242
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,600
pictures of cheddar. Okay. I think I have like a couple that

1243
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,640
I took but I have to find them. Okay. I can take care of that.

1244
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,800
Yeah, sweet. All right. Um, well, with that, I guess we're

1245
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:07,200
not really getting a lot of calls tonight. So I guess we'll

1246
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:09,760
just send you a message. Yeah, I used to say I guess we'll

1247
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,720
just kind of start to wrap up. So Jamie, if you have some

1248
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,760
stuff you got to do, then I should let you go now. So do you

1249
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:20,000
have any final thoughts for our listeners? Um, I'm actually

1250
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,720
going to bust out my vtuber tonight. We'll see if it works.

1251
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:27,920
All right, have fun. Good luck. Later tater. All right. All

1252
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:31,200
right. Well, as I usually say here at the end of the show,

1266
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,720
more Twitch follows are a great thing too. Thanks again for our

1267
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:17,440
500th follow tonight. That's exciting to see. Um, so I think

1268
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:20,400
we can get final thoughts now. So Loki your final thoughts

1269
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:24,560
tonight? I was gonna say that I didn't check last minute

1270
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:30,320
stories. Do you have stories? No, not really. Um, so I was

1271
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,880
gonna say that threads algorithm right now sucks. There's no way

1272
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,920
to filter out big people that you're not following. Which

1273
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,480
sucks. Oh, yeah, we did kind of shift up that quickly. We I

1274
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:44,000
would just say, um, yeah, the algorithm thing is shitty. It's

1275
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,280
the same thing they do with Instagram, though. And I

1276
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,960
remember when they shifted that and Instagram kind of and

1277
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,640
seeing that threads is very clearly built on Instagram. And

1278
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:57,840
I think they've even said like threads is basically

1279
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,520
Instagram's code. Um, but you know, obviously reworked for

1280
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:04,080
what they're doing there. Well, they used to have I think

1281
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,800
threads used to be a thing they discontinued it like several

1282
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,760
years ago, then they brought it back because Twitter was

1283
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,200
sucking. Yeah, there was an article I thought about that

1284
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,920
they showed that like, Oh, yeah, we're just continuing threads.

1285
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,960
That's like from 2019 or something like that. Or 2020. I

1286
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,880
remember. I didn't know it was ever around. Yeah, the the lack

1287
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,280
of algorithm sucks. But and I never did get to say this

1288
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:29,680
before. That to me is the strongest part of blue sky.

1289
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,560
It's not just the fact that you know, it's it's Twitter without

1290
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,920
Elon. But it's the the part that's really great about it is

1291
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,400
that the algorithms you have custom algorithms, and you can

1292
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,600
create your own algorithm. So and other people make

1293
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:46,800
algorithms. So for example, there's an algorithm out there

1294
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,280
called queer streamers. And I got added to it. So all my posts

1295
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,920
show up in this particular feed. And you can add whatever

1296
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,520
feeds you want. But it's not just like, a lot of them are

1297
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,680
user base. Like I know there's another really popular one

1298
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:05,680
called black sky, which is the by POC users of blue sky that

1299
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,480
are like on their algorithm, but it's not just ones that are

1300
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:13,440
user based. There are ones where it's like this algorithm

1301
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:17,200
will show you posts of cat pictures only, at least that the

1302
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:20,880
algorithm can identify. And it says some other animals sneak in

1303
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:23,280
here too, because you know, we're still perfecting the cat

1304
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:27,520
detection technology. So there are other ways to like see the

1305
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,560
algorithms and it is really powerful. And I think and it's

1306
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:35,920
a huge contrast between blue sky and threads, right? Because

1307
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,480
threads is shoving the Instagram algorithm down our

1308
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,960
throat. And a lot of us are like, we don't want to do

1309
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:43,040
written social media like this. Like it's one thing for

1310
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,360
pictures. It's another for trying to stay on top of what my

1311
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:49,200
friends are saying. But the blue sky and the custom algorithms

1312
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:53,440
and like, hey, you make your own algorithm. Or or if you

1313
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,680
want, we'll just show you everything chronologically.

1314
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:59,040
Cool. Like I think that's exactly what people want. So

1315
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,200
it's great. And yeah, I see I see.

1316
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,600
I just have to mute everybody is what I've been trying to do.

1317
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:06,720
But it's it's been a lot. It's because you know, it's like, oh,

1318
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:09,520
here's the NBA and WWE and something like that. I'm not

1319
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,160
following these. I don't care. Yeah, I don't care about like

1320
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:15,760
what this local sports team is doing. Like, and it's been like,

1321
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:18,720
I wish it was there was a way it's like, okay, prioritize the

1322
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:21,440
people that you follow first so that you could see their posts.

1323
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,600
It's just a mix. It's just a mess.

1324
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,640
Um, and well, the nice thing about blue sky again, not to,

1325
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:30,880
you know, shout out for the rooftops, but I am enjoying it.

1326
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,280
So I am gonna say and I see many of you in chat going, I

1327
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:36,160
wish I get in by wishing an invite. I know if I had a

1328
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:38,720
million of them, I'd love to hand them out. The reality is

1329
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:43,280
users on blue sky get one invite one invite every two weeks.

1330
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:47,040
So that's why if it's and I there that list that y'all

1331
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,600
signed up on, I don't think it's doing shit. I don't think

1332
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,560
we'll do anything until blue sky goes public, which you know,

1333
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,120
they're still they're still developing blue sky. And the

1334
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:59,040
problem is like that day that Elon banned the word sis or

1335
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:02,560
whatever stupid shit he came up with this week, like blue sky

1336
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,440
went down because of all the increased traffic and interest

1337
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:08,640
and you know, people so like blue sky, like they're trying

1338
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,920
to prevent a hive social situation. For those that

1339
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,480
remember when everybody fled Twitter to hive social for a

1340
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:17,680
week, and then hive just absolutely shit the bed with a

1341
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:20,960
security issue, and had to like shut down the app and never

1342
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,160
recovered, basically. I mean, yeah, it's back up, technically,

1343
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:28,160
but on a engagement base, it never recovered. So and yeah,

1344
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:30,080
mastodon, of course, is an option, too. I don't mean to

1345
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:34,720
neglect that. But yeah, that's that's why the invites are slow

1346
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:39,120
to roll out. Because in some ways, it's still not ready. So

1347
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:42,400
they just they need, you know, time to work that all out. So

1348
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:48,000
yeah, but at the same time with one invite every two weeks, it

1349
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,040
will it will pyramid its way down to you eventually. It's

1350
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:56,240
just very slow going. So but yeah, I get invites once in a

1351
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:59,040
while, too. And you know, I've been trying to invite people,

1352
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:03,200
you know, as I see them, but yeah, it's local. I let me put

1353
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:10,320
it this way. I haven't even invited Alan yet, so should

1354
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:14,160
show you that there. So. All right. I think that's enough

1355
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:16,400
discussion about social media stuff. We really probably should

1356
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:20,240
wrap up the show. So I think we got your final thought, Loki. So

1357
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:25,600
my final thought is Final Fantasy 16. I want to beat it

1358
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:28,720
this week. I hope I have the time and energy to do it because

1359
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:31,280
work's been very busy, but I'm hoping this week it starts to

1360
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:35,680
back off a little bit and I am able to sign out of work after

1361
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:40,000
eight hours instead of 11. All right. That's it, everybody.

1362
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,720
Have a wonderful night. We will see you next time on Orange

1363
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:45,040

1364
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,840
days. Good night. Have a good one. Bye.
