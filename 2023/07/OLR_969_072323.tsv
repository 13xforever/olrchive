0	14600	In the latest misreading and misapplication of the European Union's GDPR, Ubisoft has
14600	18800	an inactivity period for Ubisoft Connect where you may lose your account irretrievably. It's
18800	22200	a good thing my entire Ubisoft library exists in Steam because we've learned that Ubisoft
22200	26480	can't be trusted to manage reasonable accounting. At least Google had the consideration to refund
26480	30280	software and hardware charges. This is the latest death now for Connect. Now it's time
30280	33520	for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story
33520	36860	and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has
36860	37860	a voice.
37860	44760	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
44760	53000	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again, July the 23rd,
53000	58680	2023 with episode number 968. Excuse me. No, that's wrong. The number's wrong. It's
58680	65360	episode 969 of our show. Wow. Whoever did that is totally fired. My name is Rob Roberts
65360	71680	and joining me as they do every single week here on the program, say hello to DarkSakura
71680	72680	or Jamie Summers.
72680	73680	Hi.
73680	76680	Hi. How are you?
76680	78440	I'll be fine when my meds kick in.
78440	82560	Yeah. Well, I've been there, done that, but I hope you do feel better.
82560	90120	Yeah, I'll be fine. It's just been an incredibly busy week and you know what? Incredibly busy
90120	97400	weeks yield me sleeping until 1.30 in the afternoon on my first day off.
97400	98400	I tried.
98400	100880	I still got up and did my ballet stuff.
100880	105520	I tried to sleep in yesterday and it wasn't happening. I don't know if it was the cats
105520	115640	or my natural body clock or what, but I could not. I needed, as I call him with Alan, I'm
115640	122280	out of salad pills to help me sleep. So I needed a salad pill to help me sleep and I
122280	124960	didn't have one, unfortunately.
124960	131520	I have my own things that I take for sleep that I'm actually thinking about finding something
131520	140320	better just because part of my condition is hypersomnia and I can have cataplexic moments
140320	146520	during the day. For anyone who doesn't know what cataplexy is, it's when your body just
146520	153760	kind of stops responding and loses its tension. You know, like people who randomly fall down
153760	161760	when they walk. You know, I'm not that severe, but it's been a lot worse and I have a suspicion
161760	169200	that part of the heat is to blame for that. But it's just a little bit like not good when
169200	172880	you're in the middle of working on something and suddenly your hand doesn't want to work
172880	176880	and then five seconds later, it's okay.
176880	181360	Well, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
181360	182360	Hello.
182360	187600	Hopefully you're doing a little better this week. Hope all is going well. I notice in
187600	191640	the background tonight as we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network,
191640	196360	twitch.tv slash vog network. That's VOG network. Nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific
196360	200880	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. I noticed behind you, you have the, I think that's the
200880	206280	original fallout or fallout to playing fallout. Yeah. All out. That's pretty good. What, what,
206280	210740	what made you think of the OG fallout tonight?
210740	216380	It's the closest thing I could get to Oppenheimer. So I see, I see. Will you be, will you be
216380	219460	flipping over to Barbie halfway through the show?
219460	225300	We've already done Barbie, but yeah, we could. I mean, it would be fair.
225300	226980	It would be fair. Yes, it would.
226980	231420	It's too bad. I can't like do like half Barbie half.
231420	235020	You that's what you need to set up. You need to set up OBS or whatever you're using on
235020	238640	a split screen and you're going to fall out on one side and Barbie horse adventure is
238640	242040	on the other. And there you go. You got your barb and Heimer.
242040	248320	My, yeah, my brain just went to Barb and Heimer as like this new, uh, uh, gestalt creature
248320	257460	that you have to like fight as an enemy where everything is, you know, you've got the Oppenheimer
257460	263560	on one side and then you have the Barbie on the other. So they're like a combination.
263560	267800	I can't make brain happen. That's fine. It's you, you can appreciate this though. As somebody
267800	274120	pointed out on the book of faces to me this week is that, um, the Barb and Heimer thing,
274120	278480	um, that already happened in the nineties. We've already been there. They called it tank
278480	279480	girl.
279480	287760	Oh, tank girl. Tank girl proceeds. I mean, tank girl, the comics. Yeah, no, I don't.
287760	294520	I know. Yeah. Although I love, I, I personally thought the tank girl movie was fine and I
294520	298800	was already a fan of the comics. Apparently. I don't know if this is true or not, uh, somebody
298800	303000	who's in tune with the movie news, like tire car, somebody in our discord needs to correct
303000	308400	me or whatever. I heard that Margot Robbie, of course, Barbie, and you know, lots of other,
308400	312480	um, really legendary characters in movies right now, including what else she's been,
312480	317120	been Harley Quinn, she's been Tanya Harding, Harding. So, uh, Margot Robbie apparently
317120	322800	has the rights to tank girl or has some sort of like, I mean, I can see that he doesn't
322800	329520	work directly with Hewlett. I would be pissed. I'm, I'm sure it would be respectful. Margot
329520	334280	Robbie's been pretty, pretty good for Hollywood. Honestly, I really can't complain. And then
334280	340960	bring iced tea out of retirement to play the ripper again. Yeah. Um, I, I, I, shockingly,
340960	345320	I have not seen Barbie or Oppenheimer. I probably, I doubt I'll see Oppenheimer, but I want to
345320	350240	see Barbie really bad, but I was hosting a show last night here locally. One of the burlesque
350240	353400	troop was doing their thing last night. So I just didn't get to the theater this weekend.
353400	360960	Did you go, Logie? No, I, I, I thought my wife wanted to see Barbie, um, which I would have
360960	367200	been fine with. Um, no, we didn't end up going. I'll probably go next week though. See, um, Ninja
367200	374120	turtles, but Oh, there you go. I want to see Barbie rub. I do too. So the problem, if you
374120	378560	want to go like for serious, we need to go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night, because remember I'm,
378600	384480	I'm flying to Atlanta on Thursday, so I'm out next weekend. Yeah. Well, Monday I don't have ballet
384480	389760	and I can always, I said I was going to stream at my normal time, but I can always switch stuff
389760	396160	around. I mean, um, for Barbie. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for Barbie. And this is a perfect tie
396160	399520	into some streams I've done recently. I don't know. Have you, have you seen the cast of final
399520	404200	fantasy 16 on Twitter? Are we quick? Cause it's like, um, originally the Clive's voice actor,
404200	411480	Ben Starr did one. And now the guy that did, um, uh, Sid did one where they're going like one
411480	419880	ticket to Barbie, please. They're doing it in the final fantasy 16. I don't know why I don't know
419880	425400	who put him up to it. I don't know. Heard though that there are, there's like one
426200	433880	message that seems to have been slipping over people's heads. And that's that without spoiling
433880	441080	anything. Cause I had to go look up some context for this is that it reiterates this, um, narrative
441080	449800	that there has to be one group in charge over another group. And, uh, apparently I haven't
449800	454120	seen that coming from anybody else, but from what I know about it, that has actually seemed fairly
454120	461720	apt, uh, observance. Um, and so I really, really want to get the context out of it by seeing the
461720	467000	whole thing. Well, that's, I'm also waiting for cinema therapy to do an episode on it.
467960	472440	I was going to say, uh, I had a few friends see it and basically they said that it,
472440	479000	it ruined them. Um, in the sense that like they were extremely emotional afterwards and like
479000	486040	ugly crying and that type of stuff. Um, which is interesting. So I was like, Oh, okay.
486040	490840	But going, you know, piggybacking on what you said, dark soccer though, is that it,
490840	496280	it kind of makes this Barbenheimer phenomenon more interesting because usually you would expect
496280	499880	a lot of, you know, Oh, the movies are going up against each other, which movie is going to be
499880	503240	number one, which one's going to flop at the bottom. But this one's very much like, like
503240	509880	literally the two movies are uplifting each other. And like this whole, it's this wild phenomenon
509880	513560	that's happening with this thing, even though we've had counter programming or whatever you
513560	517640	want to call it before it's and people are already looking ahead. Now they're talking about, uh,
517640	522200	Saw Patrol because, uh, Saw 10 and Paw Patrol come out the same day.
525800	529320	Mike makes a good point out that it's like with Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal.
529320	533400	Yes. Yes. That is, that is a great point. Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal,
533400	537400	somebody else. I will say this right now. I will not see any Saw movies,
537400	541400	but I will in solidarity play a few pig matches in Dead by Daylight.
541400	546200	Perfect. Um, I was going to say there was also a great meme about, uh, the Dark Knight
546200	553000	and Mamma Mia also come, came out the same day. So, uh, the, what did they say? The Dark Mama
553000	561320	walked so Barb and Hymer could run. It's pretty good. I love it. I love it. It's great. Anyway,
561320	565000	at some point I'll get out and see the movies, but you know, just other stuff going on and
565000	570360	video games to play, but I do hope we can go see Barbie. The hot stuff also is very much a,
571320	576120	but I mean, I get going, the air, the theaters are always air conditioned and quite comfortable.
576120	579720	Usually. Usually. And practically have beds in them.
579720	585240	Yeah. Yeah. So it is nice. My problem these days is trying not to fall a fucking sleep
585240	590040	while I'm in a movie. Just put in massage chairs and I'll just die there. Okay.
591640	597640	Yeah. And by the way, just to, uh, follow up, uh, somebody in chat about the Margot Robbie
597720	602520	tank girl thing had said, Questbuster said, Margot Robbie's company has the rights.
602520	607000	So here's hoping, hoping so interesting fingers crossed.
607640	613720	All right. I just don't think that a proper tank girl movie can be done without Jamie Hewlett's
613720	619960	involvement. Um, and I was glad that there was a lot of, at least the artwork, I don't know if it
619960	626520	was him that did the art or artwork just in his direct style in the Lori Petty movie. But I mean,
626520	632360	if you want to know what else he gave us gorillas. Well, and a Lori Petty cameo would be mandatory
632360	637720	in whatever they do. Like mandatory. I love Lori. Unless she says no, but why would she say no?
638360	643560	Yeah. Anyway, of course, nothing is happening if they don't resolve that SAG-AFTRA strike as
643560	648680	well as the writer's Guild strike. So, um, obviously here's hoping that, um, the studios
648680	654280	will fucking cave on this bullshit, especially regarding AI and all this and give the actors
654280	658760	the fair contract they're looking for. So, you know, solidarity with those that are protesting.
659640	663320	We'll get some exec thinking he can write or, you know, hiring someone on Fiverr.
663320	668440	Yeah. Which by the way, I, I want to, um, you know, it is a gaming show and I want to get
668440	671640	into video game news, but all this stuff is important. Well, number one, if you didn't
671640	677160	already know, video game stuff is not part of the SAG-AFTRA strike. So like, for example,
677160	680360	I've been talking about my trip to Atlanta Southern Fried Game Expo, and I'm going to be,
681080	686680	lucky enough to moderate a panel with Nintendo voice actors from some of the recent Nintendo
686680	693720	games who voice act Bowser, as well as Princess Peach, Princess Rosalina. Um, and it's not the,
693720	697960	don't confuse it with a movie. These are the games, you know, dating way back. Um,
697960	702440	and some people are like, can you even talk about that? Yes, we can. I do not know if these folks
702440	706920	are members of SAG-AFTRA or not. I am assuming they are because I think voice acting merged
706920	713400	into that some time ago. And that's also why SAG and the voice actors already negotiated a strike
713400	718840	a couple of years ago. You may recall that there was a video game strike that I want to say was
718840	722200	threatened. I think it did go through, but only for a couple of weeks. I don't think it lasted
722200	731000	very long. Um, so, uh, video games are not part of what is being struck right now. So with
731000	734680	conventions and stuff, they are allowed to promote and talk about games. They're just not allowed to
734680	741320	talk about any movies that they may be affiliated with. So, uh, there's that. Yeah. Bobby Blackwell
741320	745960	says SAG has a separate voice actor contract. There's many, many, many different, um, types of,
745960	751000	you know, contracts and so forth. And so, uh, but obviously, you know, we, we hope by the time
751000	755960	Dragon Con rolls around or, cause you know, San Diego Comic-Con has already had to deal with it
755960	760920	this weekend is that you can't ask actors about their projects. Um, which, you know, is
760920	764600	understandable. You want to support the strike, but at the same time, it's like, Oh, this is,
764600	769480	this is a difficult line to walk. So hopefully in the next few weeks, uh, the studios will cave in
769480	774760	and, um, you know, get this AI bullshit out of here along with the other it's, I know AI is the
774760	778200	only thing I'm kind of laser focused on, but there's many other elements of the contract too.
778200	781320	And there's, you know, all the information out there on the internet, if you want to look it up.
781320	789560	Um, so yeah, uh, be interesting to see what comes of all that. Um, okay. I really do want to get
789560	796280	into some gaming news though. I want to talk a little bit about the recent Diablo four patch.
796280	801080	And the reason why I want to bring this up at the top of the show is that this really goes beyond
801080	808680	just one game. Um, this is more about the reaction to this and everything that's going on as well as
808680	812520	the patch itself. Loki, I don't know if you want me to talk about this or you want, you want to
812520	816120	do this? Cause I'm not familiar with it. Okay. That's fine. I'll talk about it. Other than
816520	823080	patch, bad walk back patch. Yeah. Uh, I know Diablo four is a little more of my camp and
823080	827720	that's fine. So I'll talk about this. So here's what's happened is that there was a patch that
827720	834120	went out this week in preparation for season one. Keep in mind that seasons are not new to Diablo.
834120	838840	They exist in Diablo three and Diablo two remastered. Um, it's all about kind of restarting
838840	842920	the character from scratch that everybody's on the same playing field. And usually there's unique
842920	847880	rewards to the season. It's kind of, kind of a reason to start playing again. It's kind of
847880	854200	a different way of doing like prestiging, if you will. Um, controversial with Diablo four is the
854200	860600	fact that they're doing a battle pass, uh, with the seasons, but the battle pass is a hundred
860600	865080	percent cosmetic. There's nothing in the battle pass that is, you know, actually affecting game
865080	869800	mechanics. Well, I take that back, but there is something in it, but the rewards are on the free
869800	875160	tier that affect, um, the season specific mechanics, but those rewards are on the free
875160	882120	tier. So the paying for it will not change that. Um, but, uh, either way, whether you wanted to pay
882120	885880	for the battle pass or not actually, and if you got a limited edition version of the game, you
885880	891000	already have the battle pass, which you can redeem in any season technically, but I don't know why
891000	894280	you wouldn't redeem it in season one. I don't see what's going to be better or different about
894280	899560	season two, but it is your choice. At the end of the day, you do, you do you. Um, but the pre-patch
899560	904920	before season one, so season one started Thursday and a pre-patch went live earlier this week.
904920	911240	And people did not respond positively to this patch because some of the things that they were
911240	916280	doing in this patch were a lot of character nerfs. They were doing a lot of, you know,
916280	921800	different powers on, uh, different characters who were being nerfed and rolled back. And one
921800	927480	of the biggest things that they were nerfing was experience. They actually were rolling back some
927480	931880	different types of experience. Um, I want to actually see if I can get the patch notes
931880	936200	actually up here. Unfortunately, this article I thought would have them didn't, but let me see
936200	945720	if I can grab them real quick here. Um, sorry. I'm, uh, should have had that up beforehand.
945720	950840	Uh, but in the pack, cause I want to cite some specifics here if I can. Okay. Yes, this is it.
950840	955080	So I'm going to go over to, for those of you watching live on Twitch, we're going to hop over
955080	961640	to the other screen so you can see these with me here. Okay. So they set up some things for the
961640	966680	actual, you know, season that this whole mechanic that's unique to the season. Okay. And then they
966680	971240	talk about, all right, they're doing, you know, some things with the items and so forth and,
971240	976280	you know, bug fixes, the usual types of things you would expect. But then when you really start
976280	982440	to get down into it, you start to get some interesting updates. Um, for example, there's
982440	987160	some renown value upgrades. This is good because it actually up the amount of renown you get from
987160	993000	doing side quests, which is, um, helps you get rewards that are locked behind that. Okay. But
993560	999240	this was one of the big things level scaling in dungeons was adjusted. Um,
999240	1003400	monsters start to trail behind the player and level at a certain point. And this change does not
1003400	1009880	affect this, but what happens is that let's say, uh, at world tier three, if you are below 55,
1009880	1015320	the levels 55, that, uh, the experience, this is what I wanted to get to pre season. If the
1015320	1022920	mobs were one level higher, you get 15% extra three levels higher, 25% extra. They change this
1022920	1031160	now you only get a 1.5% bonus. So the amount of extra experience you get for the mobsters being
1031160	1038040	higher level than you is kind of not worth it. And one reason they were trying to do this is
1038040	1043800	they were trying to actually make it so that if you are playing with your friend, so if you're
1043800	1049880	level one and your friends want to bring you right to the end game to power level you, that trick is
1049880	1057400	not going to work anymore. So now you're only going to get, so before you would get level 100
1057400	1064200	monster XP, which is a lot and a 25% bonus on top of that. Now you get an 11 monster XP and
1064200	1069400	a small bonus on top of that. Now, Mike Defton chat says, this one is fair. I agree. They're
1069400	1074280	trying to avoid a situation here. Like what happens in Diablo three seasons. And what happens
1074280	1080520	in Diablo three seasons right now is that people just the first person that gets to level 70 power
1080520	1085800	levels, all of their friends. And it kind of takes away the leveling experience. A fundamental thing
1085800	1090440	you have to understand that is a difference between Diablo three and four is that the word
1090440	1097000	Paragon means something very different. In Diablo three Paragon levels were basically like boundary
1097000	1101800	breaking levels. You were at the max level and Paragon levels go on and on and on for infinity
1101800	1108040	and boundary break. People want to rush into that stage of the game. In Diablo four, that is not the
1108040	1115480	case. Levels 50 to 100 are Paragon levels, but they're just extra levels. They're not exactly a
1115480	1121960	boundary break. Most people see level 100 as the boundary. Blizzard does not really play this any
1121960	1127560	differently, because they keep talking about the race to level 100, the first hardcore character
1127560	1132200	to 100 and all of this stuff. So you have to remember that Diablo three and four are set up
1132200	1136840	differently. And that's why I don't find this such a big deal because Blizzard is basically trying
1136840	1141080	to say you're not going to cheat your way to level 100. You need to play your way through the game.
1141080	1147000	But what's a little weird to me is that the way they did this, like a normal way I would level
1147000	1153240	playing solo would be to do nightmare sigil dungeons three levels above where I was at,
1153240	1159640	because that's about you know what you can do solo and you would get a 25% bonus. But for some reason
1159640	1165240	you can't do that anymore. I'm not sure why they changed that because I mean that doesn't really
1165240	1171000	affect the power level game. But all right, I mean, I'm gonna respect their decisions and so
1171000	1175560	forth. And I'll just say, okay, well, then you just do, you know, nightmare sigils that are around
1175560	1180840	your own level and so forth, whatever. It's just an interesting way to play the game. And then they
1180840	1185560	talked all about these other balance updates. And there's a lot if you want to look at everything
1185560	1189560	they changed with, you know, barbarian and so you can go into the patch notes look, but overall,
1189560	1195720	people were not pleased with all these nerves. But I also understand why they made some nerves
1195720	1201560	because you got to go all the way back. This season mechanic that they're putting in
1202920	1207640	the season of the malignant, malignant hearts are being added to the game, these are going to give
1207640	1213000	you extra power, they needed to do some nerves to accommodate for the extra powers that are going
1213000	1217080	to be coming with malignant hearts, so that you can't just raffle stomp your way through the game.
1217080	1223800	And again, people burning their way all over the level 100 right off the top. So I'm not going to
1223800	1229720	say that like there are some things in the patch that didn't quite make sense. But I don't think
1229720	1236200	this was really the OMG, the world is ending thing that some of the Diablo community made it out to
1236200	1242600	be. Disclaimer, I'm also not a level 100 player. So I can imagine that there are a lot of people
1242680	1248200	that were in end game theory crafting the numbers playing end game, not happy to see these nerves,
1248200	1252440	because it's going to feel like a setback before they really have a chance to experience the
1252440	1259240	malignant hearts and all of this stuff. So I thank you, Dr. C says I'm by no means a Diablo expert.
1259240	1263960	So I definitely appreciate my the perspective from folks that know better. I am by no means
1263960	1268440	Diablo expert either, but I'm a fan. And I'm trying to take a step back and go okay,
1269240	1274680	as in most cases, is this as bad as the internet is making it out to be on social media?
1275560	1280120	And the answer as far as I'm concerned is not quite. There are some question marks and there
1280120	1284760	are some weird things. But I don't think this was the worth the meltdown that people were having
1284760	1290440	over this. But nevertheless, when I say meltdown, I mean review bombing. So of course, here we go
1290440	1295080	with the Metacritic review bombs again, as if Metacritic user reviews should mean a goddamn
1295080	1299480	thing at this point, because this is what always happens to Metacritic user reviews. Don't read
1299480	1308120	them, don't trust them. They're, they're nothing. So Blizzard then also actually did a little round
1308120	1314200	table with associate game director Joe Paporia, game director Joe Shealy and community chief Adam
1314200	1318440	Fletcher, they did, they threw this together, really, they did a live event on Friday,
1318440	1323560	to try to address what happened. And they actually said in a quote here, Adam Fletcher said,
1323560	1328360	it's not the greatest play experience for players out there. We don't plan on doing a patch like
1328360	1334120	this ever again. We hear you loud and clear. Joe Paporia followed up, we know that reducing player
1334120	1339320	power is never a good experience. Sometimes we just don't get it quite right. So they went on
1339320	1343960	to detail some of the things that they're going to change. And part of that is the XP adjustment.
1343960	1349320	So the road from 50 to 100 is not going to be quite as rough as it was before. There's going
1349320	1354440	to be you know, there were some things that they're going to fix with hot fixes that were
1354440	1359000	unintended, like world tier level changes, they weren't supposed to change. And so they were able
1359000	1364040	to hot fix some of that and all this stuff. As you want to Matt and chat says seems like part
1364040	1369080	of their strategy is trying to slow the burn a little bit. Some of those balances did make sense.
1369080	1374920	Yes, there is a part of this where they're trying to slow the burn. Absolutely. And so again, I'm
1374920	1380920	not saying that like, the player base that got angry had no reason to be upset. I think it was
1380920	1387240	just maybe a little blown out of control. Anyway, in chat from quest Buster says I was not happy at
1387240	1393000	all after making it to 100 and then stacking hours on top of that to farm gear to perfect said build
1393000	1397800	and then have this patch disrespect the time I spent was not a great feeling. I was upset,
1397800	1401160	but then I just walked away from the game and I'm taking a break, which honestly,
1401160	1407160	is probably the best thing to do in this scenario. Like when it's affecting your mood like that.
1407720	1412040	I think that's very smart to recognize I should take a step back away from the game and do all
1412040	1418360	this thing. And I can see where it gets frustrating needing getting to 100 and having all this change.
1419960	1426760	But I'm kind of curious if you see yourself coming back to play the season at some point
1426760	1433160	to see what the game looks like at level 100. With this new season mechanic thing in there.
1434600	1441560	I'm kind of I just I'm kind of would be curious about this. So anyway, that's in a nutshell all
1441560	1447880	that's going on this week with Diablo four is just again, I see this as bigger than just Diablo
1447880	1454760	because again, you have the user base the fans making so much noise about this that they they
1454760	1461240	caused the community to really jump and do a unplanned roundtable about the patch after the
1461240	1466360	fact. And then you know, basically admit to we need to communicate better in the future, which
1466360	1472440	I would say that's better than most gaming companies are doing Niantic right now when it
1472440	1480680	comes to some of this feedback. So Zen monkey 11 and chat says all this season stuff games do now
1480680	1488280	is just annoying and stupid to me. Well, thank fortnight. Because now you have a lot of games
1488280	1493880	that are doing this. And to be fair with the season stuff again, season play existed in Diablo
1493880	1499160	three, but it didn't exist at the beginning. They did add it later on. There was no battle pass,
1499160	1503320	though. So that's also another thing that felt very different about Diablo three. To my follow
1503320	1508440	up question, he doesn't cost 60 $70 either. That's true, too. And that's a fair point.
1509000	1513720	questbuster and chat says I'm on the fence. I've been toying with playing a necro, which I should
1513720	1518760	have done from the start, which got off relatively unscathed. Plus, I like minion classes. You know,
1518760	1523240	what's funny is I am playing a necromancer in the season, but I'm doing the bone spear build where
1523240	1529320	you you don't have any you sacrifice all your minions for bonuses. So kind of kind of a
1529320	1536120	different way to do things. So anyway, I thought that was kind of interesting. And, you know,
1536920	1541240	we'll see how this develops and the Blizzard communicating with their player base. Again,
1541240	1545480	I know some people are still angry about stuff, but I still feel like they're doing more here
1545480	1549400	than most game companies are doing right now. And you know, again, a lot of that is probably things
1549400	1553560	they've had to learn from the past and some of the missteps with Wow, Overwatch, etc. Pretty much all
1553560	1560360	the Blizzard games have had a problem patch at some point for sure. So Zen monkey says I just
1560360	1565800	like four seasons once they go past four and get into season 25. I'm like WTF This is dumb lol.
1566760	1572920	Diablo threes on season 28 right now. So speaking of which, so I don't know what season Fortnite's
1572920	1577480	in. Fortnite hides it though, because don't they reboot don't they reboot the world and then they
1577480	1583720	call it like chapter four or something? Well, they have they have seasons in like, chapters,
1583720	1587640	I think or something like that. So there's different like events that go on throughout
1587640	1591880	the year, but then they like do like a like a massive reset and stuff. But it's usually
1591880	1597640	progressive, like a storyline and they have a big finale and then it's like the brand new season.
1598200	1603800	And Dark Soccer and I talk a lot about Dead by Daylight. And essentially, the tomes are season
1603800	1608920	events in that game, you know, so it's it's what's present in a lot of games these days and a lot of
1608920	1615560	genres. So but you don't, you also don't really have to buy anything to redeem them, you can use
1615560	1620760	iridescent shards that you run by playing the game. So it doesn't necessarily require real
1620760	1627560	money. Yeah. Not that I'm not gonna spend real money to do it. And the iridescent shards can
1627560	1631080	take a while depends how much you play. I mean, if you play a lot, then yeah, you probably will
1631080	1637560	get enough. So well, I don't know I use mine for blood points like all the time. Ah, here.
1638760	1643640	All right. Well, speaking of our gaming weeks, whether it be Diablo, DVD or otherwise, let's
1643640	1648440	talk about our gaming weeks in our kickoff segment. How was your gaming week? Dark Sakura,
1648440	1656520	how was your game? Mine was actually fairly eventful. So I did switch to going back to
1656520	1664840	retro games on my Saturday stream. And so I am playing live live. And I'm playing the original
1664840	1672120	and playing the Super Famicom version. I have a translation of it. And I am absolutely loving it.
1672120	1679560	I made it through the caveman scenario and pretty much laughed the whole time. I also played
1682520	1686920	Oh, gosh, what was the Kirby game on Super Nintendo? The one that was multiple Kirby
1686920	1690680	games. I always forget the name of it because there's so many different Kirby games. But I
1690680	1700760	played the Japanese one of it. Superstar. Yeah, I played Hoshino Kabi played through a little bit
1700760	1704600	of it got through the wispy woods fight. You know, it was pretty fun. Basically, I was just
1704600	1711320	I was testing out my new controller. I played Strider two for PlayStation. Super deluxe. Thank
1711320	1720120	you, Mike. If anyone knows this mic. But I played through a couple of stages of Strider two. I played
1720120	1729800	through Jackie crush for also for Super Famicom. I played super fantasy zone, which was the version
1729800	1741160	of fantasy zone that came out on the Sega Mega Drive aka Genesis. Just about a few other things,
1741160	1745560	I was trying to just make sure the ones that said were translated were actually translated.
1746520	1755320	And some were some were not played a little radiant silver gun. You know, I tried to get
1755320	1760360	bots a gun working and I couldn't get it to work. So I'm back to the drawing board on that.
1763240	1777960	But, um, I also of course, played a significant amount of dead by daylight. And I words we had
1777960	1785560	some pretty fun things happen. Um, we, I had a peekaboo with with a Bubba.
1787560	1791720	It was actually really cute. And I did make a clip of that one just because it was so cute.
1792440	1800120	Um, like Bubba surprised me most of the time you expect to be face camping, basement camping,
1800120	1807480	trolling, you know, tunneling shitheads. And then you find the one Bubba who's just like,
1807560	1816360	I'm gonna fun Bubba fun. Yeah, fun Uncle Bubba. Oh, nevermind that I'm wearing somebody else's
1816360	1825080	face. It's no one you know. Isn't it cages Tuesday? Yes, I think that's fun. I'm definitely
1825080	1831320	gonna be every every match is gonna be for Nick cages for a bit. Well, three Nick cages and the
1831320	1839160	person who didn't want to buy the DLC. Well, um, I am not going to be playing him right off the
1839160	1844520	bat, I think unless I'm just going to go ahead and get the adapt out of the way. But his perks
1844520	1852600	are pretty Mimi. Um, like, I don't even know I think I'm gonna have fun. But I'm also looking
1852600	1860680	forward to his red carpet cosmetic that's coming out the studded jacket. And the 50 bajillion
1860680	1865880	voice lines. I watched a video that was all of his voice lines. I guess I should say I listened
1865880	1877320	to the video. There's a lot of shits and fucks out there. Lots of them. And not at the same time,
1877320	1884040	by the way, but usually in the same sentence. Um, I played with some word scapes, you know,
1884040	1887960	my usual little, you know, what I play when I'm not doing anything else game.
1890920	1897080	Excuse me, that's, that's that. Um, my, my schedule for the week is changing a little
1897080	1902440	bit because I don't have ballet on Monday. So I'm going to be able to go a little bit
1903080	1909560	later continuously on Monday, and then I'm doing a marathon on Sunday when we should be doing a while
1909560	1917640	are good times 1130 to 1130. I'm gonna just pass out when I'm done, I think.
1920680	1925720	All right. Oh, and apart from gaming, my eye infection is healing. Finally,
1926920	1931000	it's hard to play games when your eye is like constantly watering. It's kind of gross.
1931000	1934600	Uh, Loki, how was your game week?
1935320	1944120	Um, it was all Minecraft again. So I went ahead and was working more on my final three episodes.
1944760	1951320	There was a lot of like other work to like do infrastructure stuff for later on the season.
1951320	1957800	So I had to do a lot of that this week. But I'm hoping to get I was hoping to get it done today,
1957800	1965960	but it's probably going to be early next week. And then we also checked out MCC Island,
1966840	1973640	because there's this whole thing for so let's back up a bit. So MCC is minecrafter
1973640	1980120	or Minecraft creator clash. It's a event that they do every I don't know how often it is
1980120	1988680	pretty often at least once a month with like really popular Minecraft creators, like the
1988680	1994440	biggest creators out there. And then last year, I think it was last year, maybe two years ago,
1994440	2000360	they did this MCC rising where they they're like, Okay, plebes out there, we're gonna,
2000360	2005080	we're gonna let you play with the big boys a little bit. So you just submit your application.
2005080	2011000	And maybe if you're lucky, you'll, we'll let you in and you'll do your own event. So that's what's
2011640	2017400	happening. So we created one of our new members for season three on channel 64
2018280	2024520	was enticing us to, you know, get involved. So he put together a application video. So we did that
2024520	2030520	we have a team of four now. And we went and checked out MCC Island and I suck at everything
2030520	2036760	on there. It is not my style of gameplay. So like parkour PvP stuff, like it's just,
2037720	2042920	I always have to play more of it, I guess. But yeah, basically, you had they're gonna
2042920	2048280	pick 10 different teams out of these application videos. Last time, I think there was like 3200
2048280	2054440	videos submitted to them. So obviously a lot but assuming you get in everything, you know,
2054440	2060280	you may eventually get involved with the regular MCC as well, if you place pretty high in the MCC
2060280	2065000	Rising stuff. So it's a good way to, I guess, get your foot in the door, some of these people,
2065000	2070200	you know, end up on like empires and stuff like that. Some of these big things because you have,
2070200	2077000	you know, hermitcraft, the empires folks, dream, I mean, they're all like involved with MCC. So
2077000	2084360	it's all the biggest, the biggest creators in that space. But I suck at all of it. So it'll be great.
2084360	2090040	I had such a horrible time in MCC Island, but apparently it's harder than the actual game too.
2090040	2095240	But it's just different. I'm just not used to playing that kind of stuff. But it's also
2095240	2099720	a super long shot. Anyways, we had fun making the videos. So that was fine. I don't really hear
2099720	2103480	either way promoting it. So I was a little more curious what that was all about. So yeah, thanks
2103480	2110280	for elaborating. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, it's usually pretty fun. I mean, I don't know, like, they,
2110920	2115400	assuming you get in what they do, they have a coach that they'll give you. So they'll be one
2115400	2119720	of the MCC players will actually coach you through the games and stuff like that and get you ready.
2120040	2125560	The actual event takes place at the end of next month. So it'll be a very short turnaround. I
2125560	2130760	don't know how they go through 3000 some videos. I suspect that a lot of it's not the video and
2130760	2135720	some amount of subs you got because looking at the people from last year, it's like, Oh,
2135720	2140600	these small creators with only 1 million subscribers are going to participate. It's like,
2141480	2148520	come on. Like that's a little Do they really need help? I don't know. But we'll see. We'll see what
2148520	2154760	happens. I gotcha. All right. Well, good luck. My gaming week. I already kind of talked about
2154760	2160280	Diablo four. I am playing the season in Diablo four and I'm playing necromancer and up to level
2160280	2166520	38. I think just I just cleared the season quest today because there's a whole little quest that
2166520	2169720	goes to the season. Some of it's level gated because you have to clear some strongholds.
2169720	2174760	You can't really do until level 35. So it was gated a little bit, but I just got through that
2174760	2178920	whole quest. So that was, uh, it was neat that, you know, they didn't have that Diablo three
2178920	2182040	where you would have unique storylines in the season. So I thought that was good. I mean,
2182040	2185960	it wasn't in depth, but it had voice acting and a movie at the beginning. So I was like, okay,
2185960	2192040	that's kind of neat that they went all out with that. So, uh, that was cool. Um, I'll probably
2192040	2196840	keep playing the season for sure. I don't know if I'll get all the way up to level 100, but I,
2196840	2201240	I'm through a good chunk of the battle class pass. Granted, I use, you know, cause I had
2201320	2205240	limited edition. I got my free accelerated battle pass, which gave me 20 levels,
2205240	2211000	but I'm up to like tier 39 or 40. So, um, you know, kind of gone a long way through.
2211000	2215080	So I'll probably keep going. They have the season journey, which they had in Diablo three,
2215080	2219800	which were kind of like steps and they help get you like big chunks of battle pass, uh, stuff.
2219800	2224680	So I'll, I'll probably work on that a little bit. So that'll be something that I do in the coming
2224680	2231400	weeks. And, um, other games I've played, uh, I also played, um, Overwatch randomly,
2231400	2236360	a friend of mine, um, when it wanted to play games together. And it was one of those things
2236360	2239960	where we realized this is a game that we have in common. So I played a little bit of Overwatch.
2239960	2244680	We had some really good matches, uh, last week, but, uh, today we played some more and had some
2244680	2249320	not so great matches, but that's okay. Cause I feel like I'm not as big of a flop as I thought
2249320	2253800	in Overwatch. Um, especially when it comes to support classes, like I find that like playing
2253800	2257560	Lucio and mercy kind of like the, you know, the ones that have been there. My friend is kind of
2257560	2262920	forcing me to learn Ana, which I'm not very good with the snipers, but I'm kind of forcing myself
2262920	2268440	to learn Ana cause her toolkit is really useful. So, um, that's been interesting. I never thought
2268440	2273560	I'd get back into Overwatch, but, and I'm really only doing it for my friend, but, um, it's, um,
2273560	2281000	it doesn't suck. So there's that. Um, and then the other game, I feel the need to talk about
2281000	2285240	this week is something that got released that a lot of people are talking about this week.
2285240	2289320	Cause it's kind of game adjacent, but it's not really a game. It's an app. It's a little thing
2289320	2295320	called Pokemon sleep, uh, came out and, uh, you know, we've been kind of, this has been on our
2295320	2299640	radar a little bit because, you know, we like Pokemon and there's been a lot of like WTF,
2299640	2305240	why are they doing like a sleep thing? Like why, why, why is Pokemon sleep like a thing? Um,
2305240	2311480	and so Pokemon sleep finally came out this week and, um, I'm gonna review it here on the show by
2311480	2317160	saying, um, I don't fucking get it. And, uh, I've, I did it twice and I don't plan to do it ever
2317160	2323560	again. Um, I, I don't understand the point. I failed. Maybe I'm just old. Um, but this,
2323560	2330040	this is really, I, this is pointless. It's absolutely pointless. If you want to track,
2330040	2335080	not true. If you want to track your sleep, there are plenty of ways to do it
2335960	2343080	through Android or iOS. And if you have a smart watch, whether that be an Apple watch or, you
2343080	2348840	know, whatever watch it is you have, I guarantee there are sleep trackers that do it better than
2348840	2353080	what Pokemon sleep is doing with your phone, sitting on the corner of your bed and this whole
2353080	2358200	thing. But, but they, they're, they're able to, it's very important data that they're collecting.
2358200	2362760	They're collecting the sound of your loud farts. That's right. Apparently also get picked up by it.
2362760	2365880	That's right. It records you while you're asleep. Now you could turn that off. Cause
2365880	2370440	that is very creepy. And it's actually, it's very easy to turn that off. So in all fairness,
2370440	2374520	like the recording thing, cause a lot of people look at that and go, what the fuck? But you can,
2374520	2378680	you can turn that off like real easy. Like the game kind of goes out of its way really to have
2378680	2384200	you, this is how we're going to make the next Wario game that much better. They're forcing the
2384200	2391000	fart noises. I guess. And Mike Deaf says, Pokemon sleep is not there to replace whatever you use
2391000	2394600	already for sleep tracking. It's there to incentivize people who want to improve their
2394600	2398760	sleep. That's, that's what the existing sleep trackers are supposed to do. I'm sorry. I just,
2398760	2405000	I'm going to tell you why there's again, like a lot of Pokemon games that come out, I feel it's
2405000	2411160	very messy. There's a lot of stuff like all over the place. Like, okay, you got to cook things for
2411160	2416360	Snorlax. And when you have the Pokemon, you'll get these random Pokemon that show up while you're
2416360	2420680	asleep and you can choose one of them to give a biscuit. Cause you're trying to make them your
2420680	2425720	friends so you can add them to the party and then they collect things in your party. And they, you
2425720	2429800	also have photographs that go on and then you want to check in three times a day, not just when you
2429800	2437080	sleep. Cause you want to cook the curries for Snorlax to gain the power. Everything I just
2437080	2441560	named is an actual thing in the game. And it doesn't make any goddamn sense. It doesn't.
2441560	2447400	And it's just, it's just one of those things where it's like, I w well plus also, okay,
2447400	2453000	so you get all these Pokemon. Why it doesn't connect to the other, is it going to connect
2453000	2458680	to Pokemon home at some point? If it does, then I, then I will shut up because then that makes a lot
2458680	2463800	more sense because it actually ties into the rest of the Pokemon universe. But otherwise it doesn't
2463800	2468680	like, like I've heard like, Oh, you can get shinies through this. I'd be fucking pissed
2468680	2472360	if I got a shiny in this game and I couldn't transfer it over to Pokemon home to actually
2472360	2479080	use in a real Pokemon game. So I don't know. Mike Deft says, it's really simple for me.
2479080	2484280	It's not that convoluted. I'm sorry, Deft. You know, I love you. I'm bringing the receipts.
2484280	2489000	I'm bringing the receipts because I just, I I'm bringing it. I still have it on my phone,
2489000	2492600	although I plan to delete. Is it going to yell at me for not tracking the last couple of nights?
2492600	2501480	Probably. But okay. So yeah, I got, I got power for doing something and now Snorlax is like,
2501480	2507400	yay, I'm gonna, okay. I guess I went up a level. I did something, whatever. I got rewards. I have
2507400	2512360	no idea what these do. Here's, it's another rating. I have no idea what this does. Okay.
2512360	2516680	So there's that. And then there's another rating for your Snorlax there. So there's all the Snorlax
2516680	2522360	and then there's all these other Pokemon. So like I somehow have a Pichu and a Pikachu in my party.
2522600	2528360	And now look, you have all these buttons that do shit down here in the corner, the main menu. And
2528360	2533320	when you go to the main menu, look at this. God damn it. Now I'm getting more tips. Okay. You go
2533320	2537560	to the main menu and look at this. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
2538600	2544760	10, 11 buttons that all do different things. I heard you. Nevermind. I misheard what you
2544760	2548680	just said. What did you think I said? I thought you said you got tits.
2549240	2560200	Well, maybe I did. No, I did not. But anyway, my point is, is it a sleep tracker or is it a
2560200	2567160	micromanagement game? Because I'll tell you, it's a micromanagement game. And there, and again,
2567160	2572520	I want my micromanagement game to have somewhat of a point. There is, I guess, a friends feature,
2573640	2578520	but I connected it to Facebook. Nobody added me as a friend. And then when I went back in to see if
2578520	2581880	any of my friends were on it, it said, you need to reconnect to Facebook. So I was just like,
2581880	2587160	I'm, I'm over this. I'm over this already. I don't get the point. I have a sleep tracker.
2587160	2591320	I've been running it for quite some time. If you want to see how horribly I sleep,
2591320	2596680	it's this lovely little thing that I have that shows me. So last night I got some pretty decent
2596680	2602040	sleep, but actually shows me like how it went and all that good stuff. So that's what I use.
2602600	2606680	Here's the thing. Maybe I would feel a little differently.
2607720	2612840	If the game would just tap into the existing data that my watch is already giving it.
2613480	2619640	Why does it need to do its own separate thing by lying on the bed and inferior way of tracking
2619640	2625000	sleep as opposed to something that can measure your heart rate regularly? I don't understand
2625000	2629880	that. And I do realize there is a separate device that you can also buy and all this,
2629880	2635800	I'm still not going to track your heart rate. So it's just, it's wild. So I'm not a fan.
2636440	2640760	If you're a fan, congratulations. I hope you catch all the Pokemon and then won't be able
2640760	2646520	to do anything with them. But you'll feel really good. And that's the point. That's the point.
2646520	2650120	Yeah. We didn't even touch on monetization. There is monetization.
2650840	2651480	Oh, of course.
2652440	2657160	I, I can't tell you what it is because the minute I saw it, I was like, I'm, I will,
2657160	2664760	I will never give this game money. So I didn't even look into what it did anyway.
2666520	2672600	So that's, that's, that's my thought. So, okay. My dev says the dev say they would like to connect
2672600	2677960	with other existing apps or devices for sleep tracking. Great. I will be happy to amend my
2677960	2685560	review at that point, as it stands now, hard pass. In fact, it's coming off my phone. So that's that,
2685560	2689560	that little bit of me playing it right there is the last you're going to get for a little bit.
2690600	2695400	I love what SSU100Matt said in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
2695400	2698600	S2 100 Matt says bigger menu than the cheesecake factory. Yes.
2701080	2703480	But no complimentary bread. What's up with that?
2706120	2711000	All right. That was my gaming week. Let's get into some gaming news and what's going on around
2711000	2717000	the industry. We will start off with, Oh, and real quickly, just I've plugged it a lot, but I'm
2717000	2723320	legally required to say I will be at Southern fried gaming expo this weekend in Atlanta.
2723320	2729240	It is running the 28th through the 30th of July at the Marriott Renaissance Waverly hotel.
2729240	2734200	That is right by the Atlanta brave stadium, if you weren't already aware. So if you are somewhere in
2734200	2738600	the Atlanta area or even a little far, I encourage you to drive in, say hello. I'll be doing a panel
2739240	2743400	Sunday at one o'clock featuring Nintendo voice actors. I'm really excited to be there,
2743400	2747480	play a hell of a lot of video games and just have a good time. It's just going to be a fun weekend.
2747480	2752200	And then I'm looking forward to going right back in five more weeks for dragon con. I'm racking up
2752200	2757400	those frequent flyer miles, except I'm taking two different airlines for some reason. Well,
2757400	2763400	I know the reason why this trip I used reward points. The other trip, Alan and I are going,
2763400	2772280	so we bought Southwest. So yeah, anyway. All right, let's move on into some other
2772280	2775560	gaming news and what all is going on. So Loki, we'll start with you.
2776120	2782520	Yeah, so the end of the show last week, we talked a little bit about how game pass cores and be
2782520	2791000	replacing Xbox Live Gold. And we got some more details on that shortly after our show ended.
2791080	2796200	So basically, the four different tiers that they have now, they're all going to be game pass. So
2796200	2801640	game pass cores, basically what Xbox Live Gold was the main difference being that you're not going to
2801640	2808360	be getting the two games a month that they had previously. But instead, it's going to be kind of
2808360	2817720	a catalog of 25 high quality games, they say on console. So it's kind of like a smaller
2818600	2825240	library that you would have with the normal game pass. And that's $10 a month, they have the console
2825240	2830600	game pass, which is $11 a month. And then of course, you kind of know what that is PC, of
2830600	2837160	course, the PC game pass for 10 bucks, and then ultimate for 17 a month. And what games are going
2837160	2842600	to be coming with that collection? Well, they we do know what those are. And they said new titles,
2842600	2848360	and they said new titles we added two or three times a year. So some of the things in there
2848360	2856600	Among Us Dishonored 2, Doom Eternal, Fable Anniversary, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Forza Horizon
2856600	2865880	4, that's awesome. Gears 5, Grounded, Halo 5 Guardians, Halo Wars, Psychonauts 2, Ori and the
2865880	2871400	Will of the Wisps, State of Decay and The Elder Scrolls Online, Tamriel Unlimited. And then of
2871400	2877080	course, there's some other stuff in there as well. Among Us, for example. So not a bad library.
2878760	2884520	But yeah, so obviously, I think they're trying to entice people to just spend the extra dollar
2884520	2891320	and just get game pass. But if you don't want to, you don't have to and if you are an existing
2891320	2897080	Xbox Live Gold member, your membership will convert to game pass core on September 14.
2897880	2904040	Um, so some real talk for a minute, the free games they've been given away on Xbox Live Gold have not
2904040	2910520	exactly been scraping that bottom of the barrel for a while, some decent indie titles in there.
2910520	2916360	But let's be real, there is no showstoppers. Let's usually use that word. There's no showstopper
2916360	2921160	like get like attention grabbing giveaway they've done on Xbox Live Gold in a long time.
2922120	2927400	This allows the system to pivot to something where they can have some big names. A lot of
2927400	2931720	those names you just read right there can have some big names that are available. And of course,
2932360	2936760	are they available on cloud too? When you do this? I think that's a huge question. No,
2936760	2944280	because core is not cloud ultimate is the only one that has cloud play. So yeah, if you want,
2944920	2950600	I mean, I think the argument is that you would want to probably just have the regular game pass
2950600	2956840	if you're playing on console. It's only $1 more a month. Yeah, I mean, really for, you know,
2956840	2963000	25 versus hundreds of games and all the brand new like Microsoft games coming in there as well. Like
2963000	2968760	it just, it makes sense to do that. But I mean, if you're really looking not to spend that extra
2968760	2973240	dollar a month, I mean, it's already $10 a month. You just want quite a bit. You just want Madden
2973240	2978440	multiplayer. That's all you want life. You don't want anything else, then you there you go. You can
2978440	2986760	save the extra buck. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, the sj 100 match in chat says Yeah, I haven't touched
2986760	2991640	the games with gold games since pre game pass. I keep forgetting to download those people echo and
2991640	2996040	say same, same, same. The sometimes the only reason I remember the PlayStation ones with the
2996040	2999480	PlayStation ones have actually been kind of better like Alan Wake remastered I was actually really
2999480	3005080	excited about that. So like, but but PlayStation if you have the app will send you a push notification
3005080	3012360	and remind you, hey, it's not too late to grab Microsoft does not do that. Yeah. So it is kind
3012360	3021400	of nice. So but yeah, I this doesn't really surprise me. I'm surprised that the term Xbox
3021400	3026680	Live is going away. That is a little bit, you know, weird and like, Oh, wow, that was such,
3026680	3032680	you know, especially when that rolled out. If you think about it, this show has I mean, I don't like
3032680	3038280	to toot our own horn too much. But to to folks for a minute. This show has now seen the birth
3038280	3044680	and the death of Xbox Live. And that is wild to me. We were here when Xbox Live started,
3044680	3048760	it wasn't that long into the show was like six months after we started our and now here we are
3048760	3056520	at the end, which is wild to me. So but I mean, everything that game pass is doing and especially
3056520	3062040	when we talk about you know, the cloud gaming and the Netflix style model of video games,
3062040	3069720	it makes sense. It is the future of games. So I'm not surprised. So online multiplayer is not
3069720	3076200	quite the name brand future feature, even though they all charge for it, the name brand feature
3076200	3080600	that it used to be so I get that they're, you know, compiling it all into one program, but it
3080600	3087560	does it feels a little weird with Xbox Live. But such such as life things change things rebrand.
3088440	3095080	It happens. All right. Well, speaking of things change, you might remember last week on the show,
3096040	3100680	we were talking about towards the end of the show that like, hey, by the time we kind of get to
3100680	3105400	the show next week, we're going to be looking at emerged activism, Blizzard, Microsoft,
3106120	3112600	psych, here we are. It's been a week that did not have years later. I know, right? Well,
3113560	3119000	apparently an extension has happened, but it's only a two month extension. Here's what happened.
3119000	3127160	So they were supposed to hit that target of July 18 to merge the companies. But because of the CMA
3127160	3131800	over in the UK, the competition in the markets authority because of that block still being in
3131800	3136600	place, and they have not found that workaround yet, even though now they are past all the hurdles
3136600	3142840	in the US. So you know, even with the FTC turn up, it's done. It's going to happen in the US,
3142840	3148280	the UK CMA is the sole holdout. But because they haven't worked that out yet, they have
3148280	3157320	made an agreement. So Microsoft, Activision, and the CMA have actually basically extended that,
3157320	3162680	you know, it's going to take, I guess the extended of the deadline for the final decision is now
3162680	3171000	August 29. So because of that, Microsoft and Activision are going to extend their completion
3171000	3177960	deadline further out. There's big penalties if the companies do not merge. And I don't think that's
3177960	3182440	because of a court thing. I think that's because if Microsoft pulls out of the deal, there'd have
3182440	3187720	to be a huge fee paid. I don't see us going down that bridge. This is now about what is the UK
3187720	3192200	going to do and what does Microsoft soon to be Activision Blizzard do in response?
3192200	3195720	Because if the CMA does not reverse their decision, I think we're likely to see
3196920	3200840	some pullout in the UK, which could be very, very, very interesting.
3203640	3210360	But as of now, nope, no merged company. And now we may have to wait till the end of August. So
3210360	3217560	maybe by the time we get to Labor Day, we'll finally be talking about this. Goodness.
3218680	3222280	All right. Well, speaking of decisions in the UK that are a pretty big deal,
3222280	3223480	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
3225080	3233160	Well, the UK has been deliberating over what to do about the whole loot box situation. Is it
3233160	3239560	gambling? Is it a gateway drug, slippery slope, blah, blah, blah. Some countries have already
3239560	3245800	flat out banned them like Belgium and the Netherlands. But their culture secretary,
3245880	3250520	Nadine Dorries, said that because they were still gathering evidence,
3251240	3257640	they said direct government intervention may risk unintended consequences. And that's a quote.
3258680	3266360	So they've actually agreed on some principles. So the first is a commitment to make available
3266360	3273080	technological controls to restrict anyone under 18 from acquiring a loot box without consent or
3273080	3277800	knowledge of a parent or guardian. So a lot of the controls are already there, but they're not
3277800	3287880	used very widely. So these would basically set up a best practice for parents. And then a second is
3287880	3295080	to make people more aware of these controls of the public information campaign and setting up a panel
3295080	3304600	to share, again, those best practices. Basically, game companies will have to disclose the presence
3304600	3310200	of their loot boxes before someone chooses to buy a game. And the games will have to show clear
3310200	3321240	probabilities before they buy a loot box. So basically, they also are working to enact more
3321240	3328200	lenient refund policies for these. And then they also want to tackle the black market that's around
3328200	3334120	loot box purchases. They are going to be monitoring it for the next 12 months
3334760	3337720	and seeing what the results is.
3340440	3340940	Interesting.
3341560	3346520	Apparently, there's people who already have an addiction to loot boxes,
3347320	3353320	who have taken out loans to get content in games via loot boxes.
3353320	3353820	Yeah.
3353820	3357720	And it really, for them, it is the same as a gambling addiction.
3359720	3364360	Interesting. I did not realize, I mean, I was gonna say I did not realize there was a black market
3364360	3369160	around loot boxes. But yes, of course, there is because I do remember years ago, you got to way
3369160	3373720	back when everybody was getting their Xbox 360s hacked. That was all part of loot boxes on the
3373720	3378920	black market. They were buying EA FIFA packs, and doing shady stuff with that and selling those
3378920	3384200	accounts. So interesting. I just never thought of black market regulation as a part of it. But I
3384200	3386200	guess that's some good news in that.
3386200	3391400	Or even people selling, you know, their systems with save files on it, because it has
3391400	3395640	out of print material on it, like the PT thing with PlayStations.
3395640	3400440	Or a flappy bird on a phone. Yeah, it's true. It's true.
3400440	3411400	Which came back. I mean, people are gullible. But I mean, it's just more or less opening the door
3411400	3414840	for exploitation. And people are always going to jump on it.
3414840	3416840	Yeah, it's true.
3416840	3422280	You can't regulate greed. You can only curb it via regulation.
3422280	3429240	Good point. Comment from message when I'm 100. Matt in chat says, got to be honest, I kind of
3429240	3433800	missed the loot boxes in Overwatch, not the buying part. But getting the boxes and getting the random
3433800	3439800	skins and so forth were a lot more fun than the battle pass thing. I might agree with that,
3439800	3444200	actually, is that like the battle pass is kind of meh. I think it really depends on the game,
3444200	3448520	though. It really depends on the game. Like I if they did loot boxes and dead by daylight, I'd be
3448520	3455080	annoyed. So but Overwatch, it doesn't bother me. So I would, I would wish they had they'd have a
3455080	3462120	system similar to among us. I, you know, I had just started playing that last week. And I like
3462120	3466280	the progression system where you earn points. And then you kind of like, it's almost like a skill
3466280	3470920	tree, the unlock stuff as you go along. So it's like, Oh, I can get this skin by to unlock this,
3470920	3474920	this, this and this person, but you're still getting stuff along the way. And they reward you
3475320	3479080	But you're still getting stuff along the way. And they reward you for playing, which,
3479720	3482600	I mean, I think that's kind of really easy to get in that game.
3482600	3487240	Yeah, exactly. So like, I, I wish it was like that type of system. But,
3487240	3491960	you know, they need, they want the money. But like, even with that, though, like there was
3491960	3497320	skins, like, isn't what you're talking about very similar to the combat crypt in Mortal Kombat with
3497320	3504840	like 1000. Maybe I don't know what like, there was like, and I wanted those from among us.
3504840	3509000	So I bought the pack for it. And then it gives you like a new skill tree thing that you can
3509000	3514760	unlock stuff in. And I think that's cool. Like, that should be the way it's done. At least that,
3514760	3518920	you know, it's like, okay, I want a thing. I know what I'm getting with that thing. But they're not
3518920	3523080	giving me that thing right away. You still have to earn it through like gameplay, but at least
3523080	3528840	it's like stuff you can unlock. So the other awesome thing about it is that you can pick
3529480	3536200	which set of skills or items you're unlocking by choosing which path you're walking on at that
3536200	3542920	time. And I think that that's great, because it can let people focus on, you know, I want
3542920	3549640	stuff for my healer, let's have a healing tree. I want stuff for, you know, melee, let's have a
3549640	3553720	melee tree. That would be great. Yeah.
3555720	3560360	All right, well, let's move on. The UK is really dominating gaming news this week,
3560360	3563160	because this next story is about them too, right? Logie?
3563720	3570200	Yeah, so there is a, basically, I think, like a regulation, that's a mandate that's passed the
3570200	3576600	European console, or council that is basically requiring that all batteries that are in appliances,
3576600	3582360	light transport vehicles, I'm assuming, like they said, electric bikes, electric scooters,
3582360	3587720	that type of thing. And other devices should be removable or replaceable by the end user.
3587720	3595160	I think it's to basically eliminate some of the waste that goes out there. Like so for example,
3595160	3600360	like if I have a controller for my PlayStation four, something like that, the battery dies in
3600360	3605160	it, I got to replace the whole controller. Unless you know, I go and take it apart. But now they're
3605160	3609000	saying, oh, well, yeah, we'll just have, you know, a replaceable battery, then you can put a
3609000	3615400	new battery in there. And it's good as new. So if this goes into effect, the thought is, well,
3615960	3621800	maybe then if it's a regulation that now game consoles, like, namely, the switch will have to
3621800	3627400	put out a version that has a removable battery, or whatever the switch Pro is that comes out,
3627400	3634440	we'll have to have a battery that is removable or serviceable by the consumer. Which is good,
3634440	3637800	I think they should do that. I remember old cell phones used to have that is is good,
3637800	3641320	because I bet a lot of these devices with the batteries embedded, you know, even though
3642280	3646600	s 200. Matt says I had to replace a bunch of my handheld batteries because a bloat or not not
3646600	3650440	being able to hold a charge lately, Nintendo makes it more or less pretty easy to replace batteries,
3650440	3654520	just a few screws, and you're done PSP even easier mobile phones are more of the problem.
3654520	3659080	I bet in any of those cases, people just throw the shit away. And I don't think that's particularly
3659080	3664120	great. So I think this is good that they're gonna make make it very easy to flip out the
3664120	3670200	battery that it needs to be sure. Yeah, my PSP is I had a few of them. And I think I had to throw
3670200	3674920	all the batteries away. I hope I've thrown all the batteries away for those because yeah, they do
3674920	3682440	blow up after a while. And same with phones. I think the phones for sure. You may be it wasn't
3682440	3689000	even that long ago where we had stories about Apple throttling their phones because batteries
3689000	3695560	wear down. And so it was causing the newer operating systems are causing, you know, battery
3695560	3702440	usage to be greater. And so they would throttle it to allow, you know, the older phones, I guess,
3702440	3707000	to be able to work along or whatever the case may be. But it's kind of almost like a planned
3707000	3711720	obsolescence at that point, because there's no such thing. There's no such thing as planned
3711720	3718760	obsolescence. Pretty much. It's just the way I don't think so. There's certainly there's
3718760	3724760	a lot of things that you buy now that don't last as long as they used to if you were to buy them,
3724760	3730200	you know, several decades ago, it's just several decades ago, they didn't have as delicate
3730200	3734680	technology as they do now. Yeah, but not even necessarily delicate technology stuff like we're
3734680	3740360	talking like dishwashers and you know, major appliances and stuff like that, like a lot of
3740360	3745480	that stuff last. I'm sure there's a lot of people that have like an old refrigerator that is you
3745560	3751240	just kick it away. Whereas you buy a new refrigerator craps out after like a few years.
3751240	3756760	So it's it I think there is obviously there's companies are going to say, Oh, yeah, we're
3756760	3762280	planning to make something obsolete. But at the same time, there is planned obsolescence. I mean,
3762280	3768600	with even like, not talking even hardware, like looking at, you know, a lot of phones,
3768600	3773000	after a while, they stopped receiving updates for their operating systems. And so basically,
3773000	3776280	it's like, okay, we got to buy a new one if you want those new features, because we're not going
3776280	3780920	to support the old one anymore. And I get it because it is processing power and all that type
3780920	3785640	of stuff. But I actually think of I think the most egregious example is not in the in the
3785640	3792440	universe. I think it's the K cups is what I think of. Yeah, that's the one that I go, Oh, no, that
3792440	3796760	was that was dirty what they were doing there. You know, because at least at least with phones,
3796760	3800280	or whatever you want to name, you can technically still use those devices, you can play whatever
3800280	3804600	games time on them. With the K cups, they were literally trying to say like, if you have an old
3804600	3810600	Keurig, you're not even going to be able to buy new coffee cups to use with it. That's kind of
3810600	3815880	what I would put in there. So tell me do cars today take the same tires as a 1969 Mustang?
3817480	3824760	No, no. And why? Because the way the cars are built today are built better with different
3825480	3827800	tires in mind. So I mean,
3829960	3835320	things are going to change and move. It doesn't mean that it's planned to fail.
3838920	3845160	There's also not designed to last though, like there's there could be precautions or like steps
3845160	3851240	are taken to make a product last longer, but it's not in their best interest to have a product last
3851240	3856680	longer, they want to last a decent amount of time. And then you'll buy a new one from them is
3856680	3861960	and Rama said it said it exactly right. As OS is get more advanced, older hardware can't support
3861960	3868840	it exactly. And I have seen what happens when people try to hack their systems. To put will
3868840	3875240	put like hacked versions of operating systems on and then see them struggle. See the the firmware
3875240	3878840	for it cause all kinds of problems with their system because it's not built to accommodate it.
3879400	3884200	I mean, it's just the nature of technology, it's going to move on past the hardware.
3886840	3891880	They can also design the hardware to be able to be upgraded. Like for example,
3891880	3896600	there are phones and laptops that they have very few that have replaceable parts,
3896600	3903160	including the processors, how long those base last before the new parts aren't going to work with
3903160	3908440	them. I think I thought of something very important with all of this because my brain
3908520	3912760	was thinking about well, okay, I mean, you have PlayStation, PlayStation two, PlayStation three,
3912760	3916600	PlayStation four, and by the time PlayStation, you're not making original PlayStation. But
3916600	3925320	here's the thing that is making that all different now, the cloud. Because why did something what was
3925320	3931560	a big selling point of stadia in the first place? Oh, even on this oldest Chromebook,
3931560	3936120	you can run Google stadia and run the newest games on this because it's all in the cloud.
3936760	3942360	So I, in a way, this this cloud direction that we're moving in, in a way I think is
3942360	3946360	actually kind of an obsolescence breaker in an interesting way.
3946360	3951080	Not necessarily, because even so, even playing it in a browser,
3952120	3958840	there's still going to be some limitations on you say that the base game to play it effectively,
3958840	3963640	even in a browser requires eight gigabytes of RAM, and you're on the system that only has four
3964040	3969720	is not necessarily going to run, say that playing through like, actually, I'll put it right now,
3969720	3976120	say that on GeForce, say, if you have, you know, very weak internet, you're going to get that pop
3976120	3980920	up that says the game is shutting down, your internet connection is bad, you won't be able
3980920	3985480	to use the service, there's still going to be a technological requirement, even for cloud based
3985480	3992840	gaming. Anyway, I was somehow we hopped over to this from the replaceable battery thing in game,
3993240	3999560	I think, or in consoles, I think at the end of the day, I'm, I think for the environment concerns,
3999560	4004680	I think it's probably the best because there are too many people. What all of you are saying in
4004680	4008920	chat is true about how easy it is to replace the batteries and some of them that is still too
4008920	4014200	difficult for a lot of people that would just throw the damn thing out. And so I think this
4014200	4018600	is a really good way to help ward off electronic waste at the end of the day. But we'll see. I mean,
4018680	4023400	but we'll see. I mean, maybe it's just buying time too, because inevitably, I get the rest
4023400	4027880	of the conversation we've been having. Inevitably, these devices will get probably thrown out anyway,
4027880	4031880	as they become obsolete. But I think it buys a lot of time. I don't know.
4032680	4038600	Well, I think that more companies to go along with that need to adopt the same kind of policy
4038600	4047720	that the place I work for has where, by 2030, there's going to be a zero carbon footprint.
4048920	4055800	Every piece of technology that's put out there is able to be brought back in and recycled
4056840	4064280	for zero waste in production of new materials. Because now there's so much out there that any
4064280	4070360	of these items can be turned back in through a native recycling program. And like, hey,
4070360	4076520	we'll give you a gift certificate for the value of whatever you're bringing back in,
4077480	4081400	for the value of the parts of what you're bringing back in, recycle the parts, put them into the new
4081400	4086520	machinery. And that way you keep operating at a lower cost, one thing, because you're not
4086520	4093160	needing to buy new materials, just the whatever it's going to cost to recycle them. And I think
4093160	4098520	every company needs to have a mandatory recycling program. Like, hey, you done with your Xbox,
4098520	4104200	and you don't want to sell it to a kid down the street? Send it back to us, and we will recycle
4104280	4109880	it for you. And it will become somebody else's Xbox, which Microsoft is, is there's several
4109880	4115320	companies have signed on to that Microsoft was one of them too. So yeah, of course, the name.
4115320	4125720	So um, but Oh, damn, what was gonna say with that? I'm very curious. I would think some states
4125720	4130520	are probably trying to pass laws around that too. I don't know to what extent they can,
4130520	4136920	I have to admit. But I do think about like, you know, the infamous California electric car law,
4136920	4139880	right, where like, all the cars sold in California have to be,
4140920	4147960	to some extent, electric by a certain year, which is going to be very interesting. So anyway,
4147960	4151800	I'm just curious, any new purchase of a car, right? No, yeah, it's not going to get rid of
4151800	4156440	old cars, but it's still gonna, you know, there's gonna come a point where gas stations are a thing
4156440	4163240	of the past. And so, or a niche, I say niche, there'll be a niche, like like diesel pumps,
4163240	4169320	or well, that's not that's, I was just reading an article where Switzerland and I think Norway
4169320	4175800	are doing the induction charging roads. They're starting to do them. Oh, that's cool.
4176840	4182680	Yeah, which I think, I mean, if we incorporate that, just I mean, it's going to be expensive.
4183400	4190200	But if they implement that, you know, let's just say California wide, since we have that law,
4191000	4198280	then it's, I mean, first of all, I think that they're also using more durable materials than
4198280	4206200	simple asphalt. Yeah. And the fact that the charging system is going to basically
4206200	4215560	remove so many different sources of emissions. And not just that, but those charging stations
4215560	4222120	won't need to be as necessary and, you know, have people take up space parking and all kinds of-
4222120	4224680	God, could you imagine- There's more to it, but I'm sleepy.
4224680	4228840	Yeah, no, so I was like, could you imagine if I5 was just a giant charging through all the
4228840	4232760	poo poo cow farms that you try to throw the way to Disneyland? Or yeah, or the 99?
4232760	4237080	It's like F zero. Yes, it is. It is literally like F zero.
4239160	4244360	Maybe they were onto something with that. All right. All right. Let's move on and talk about
4244360	4249080	something that you may not want to replace if it inevitably ends up getting rid of it. And that is
4249080	4256040	your Ubisoft account. Apparently Ubisoft is going to be suspending inactive accounts. This could be
4256040	4262040	very bad if you have games that you've purchased attached to it. Some emails have been spotted
4262040	4267400	going out. There's a Twitter user that posted a screenshot of an Ubisoft support email that said,
4267400	4271640	your Ubisoft account has been suspended for being inactive. If you don't log in in 30 days,
4271640	4277480	it will be closed permanently. Yikes. That's very bad if you have purchased games on it.
4277480	4282440	Now it's important to note, this doesn't mean that not playing it for 30 days makes it go inactive.
4282440	4286280	In fact, the official time period, we're still trying to figure out exactly what that is. Some
4286280	4291080	people were saying it's like up to four years or something like that. But still just that whole
4291080	4297400	fact that Ubisoft is looking at possibly closing inactive accounts, even if games are on them.
4297400	4301880	That is a little bit weird to me and kind of, I feel like it's gonna scream class action lawsuit.
4301880	4306520	And yet I know, I know, when you agree to buy games digitally, you have this, I know,
4307160	4311720	you don't have to, but I'm telling you, do you think that's going to stop a class action lawsuit?
4312920	4317640	If somebody loses their, you know, five year old copy of, you know, Rayman or whatever, you know,
4317640	4321880	they bought on Ubisoft some time ago. Go back and play Assassin's Creed 2.
4321880	4328360	Yeah. But I know Italy for you. I did sign into my Ubisoft account just so I was like,
4328360	4332120	Oh, maybe I should do that because it's been a while. But then I realized it actually hasn't
4332120	4338280	been that long. Because I if you have PC game pass, and you've played anything on Ubisoft,
4338280	4344600	such as Oh, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, through that, you're gonna have logged into the Ubisoft
4344600	4351160	thing relatively recently. Or in tried and chat says, Yeah, I just threw it away. It didn't look
4351160	4356440	like you were using it anyway. Yeah. dark to see it says I know they had a bunch had a bunch of
4356440	4360680	freebie giveaways that I just have sitting there. Yeah, I think a lot of people probably built out
4360680	4365240	built up free stuff on their account. And it's probably an Ubisoft's best interest to get rid
4365240	4370920	of those accounts that are just sitting there. It still seems a little bit shady to me. Whether it's
4370920	4378440	legal or not, it just seems shady. So it is shady and end of it. But I have a feeling that they're
4378440	4384600	doing it for I mean, it's it's, I don't think they're doing it as any sort of like malicious
4384600	4391400	action or anything or to. I mean, it would be a good way to promote people to go back and and
4391400	4398280	give them their products more more views. But at the same time, I'm sure that these accounts with
4398280	4404440	data storage are taking up space. Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to give them a benefit of a doubt. But
4404440	4411080	typically, I don't because it's Ubisoft and we know what has happened. Yeah. And to be fair,
4411080	4415400	that Ubisoft said I wouldn't even call it up forward, whatever the fuck they call that thing
4415400	4420360	to be soft forward. Okay, whatever it's called has probably seen more users on it in the last
4420360	4425320	two days since this news story came out than it has in the last two years. Because everybody's
4425320	4429000	logging in to make sure they don't lose their account. So I don't know, maybe the whole thing
4429000	4435640	was a genius evil plot. Who knows? sjo 100. Matt with a with an excellent point I agree with in
4435640	4441960	our chat room saying should delete eavesgimaw for being inactive and caring about Ubisoft's employees
4441960	4450920	preach. Well said, well spoken, agreed, cosigned. Yes. All of that. Let's move on to some news that
4450920	4459640	could potentially be a little more exciting dark soccer. Well, this is news from a leaguer. So take
4459640	4467080	it with you know, an entire salt lick. But there is a rumor that Sega is bringing back altered
4467080	4472760	beast and Gunstar Heroes, which I mean, first of all, that's going to make my husband really giddy
4472760	4480920	because he loves Gunstar Heroes. But altered beast is, you know, wise from your grave.
4482680	4490120	But yeah, they are looking to go back into their back catalogue and see about making new projects
4490120	4499800	out of it. There's not really a whole lot about that. But there is a player survey out and about
4500440	4508360	for gathering feedback to see what people would like to see more of and mention among them is,
4508360	4515480	of course, the Sonic series, Yakuza, Valkyria Chronicles, Phantasy Star, and a few more. In
4515480	4519640	fact, one of the questions I'll just read the entire list. What games do you want to see more
4519640	4524920	new content for? Sonic the Hedgehog, Yakuza, Super Monkey Ball, Bayonetta, Gunstar Heroes,
4525000	4531800	Shinobi, Jet Set Radio, Phantasy Star, Phantasy Star Online, Sakura Taisen or Sakura Wars, Shining,
4531800	4535960	Altered Beast, Retro Fighter, Streets of Rage, Valkyria Chronicles, Puyo Puyo,
4537640	4543480	Project Diva, Shenmue, Football Manager, Total War, Golden Axe, House of the Dead,
4543480	4548920	Virtua Tennis's Crazy Taxi, Other. So hell yeah, Other.
4549560	4553000	Yeah, I'm totally down for Other. That's right.
4554520	4564200	But Other too. I think that the Gunstar Heroes one though is pretty good for this house.
4564200	4567960	I think the Altered Beast concept is pretty cool too though. We haven't seen that series in a long
4567960	4573000	time. I'd be jazzed to see Altered Beast may come back. But I'm also very much, and I'm sure we all
4573000	4578840	are on the same page and start to see it in our chat, who says, Dear Sega, do not, and I can't
4578840	4587640	stress this enough, fuck up a new Gunstar Heroes. Truth. Do not. I mean, I still want to see
4588920	4594200	like a treasure delve, you know, back into their old stuff, like bring us out a
4596440	4602760	modern cleaned up version of Silhouette Mirage or was it Doki Doki Mischief Makers?
4603640	4610440	You know, I think that our Chameleon Twist or, you know, actually re-release
4610440	4616280	Radiant Fucking Silver Gun, and not 50 bajillion copies of Ikaruga, please. That'd be nice.
4617000	4621880	I really love the idea of an offline Phantasy Star game for a change, you know, and we've seen
4623960	4628680	Phantasy Star single player games that were kind of modeled after the online ones because they
4628680	4632920	had that PS Vita Phantasy Star game. Now, of course, I can't remember the name of it,
4632920	4636600	but of course, Phantasy Star universe was kind of in two parts. There was the online mode,
4636600	4641480	and there was an entire single player mode as well in that game. I'd dig a new offline
4641480	4645240	Phantasy Star to be honest. Not that I dislike the online ones. I just would be curious what
4645240	4650760	they do with it. It'd be very interesting. Yeah, and I agree with Rama and Quest Buster,
4650760	4656200	basically like going back to the roots of Phantasy Star 5 would be badass, I think.
4656920	4668360	So we'll see. All right, Loki. All right, so we talked a while ago now, I think we mentioned that
4668360	4675640	basically Epic is opening up Fortnite to allow folks to create their own games within Fortnite,
4675640	4683560	kind of like Roblox a little bit. Well, now we have word of a veteran FPS dev that's forming
4684200	4689160	a new studio to actually do that. They are going to be making games within Fortnite.
4694280	4700360	The game that they're talking about is Outlaw Corral, which is like a Western 1v1
4701080	4706600	FPS game. Doesn't sound that great, but you know, that's fine, I guess.
4706600	4714920	But yeah, you can check it out. They have like an island code that you can look at the game, but
4715800	4722760	I mean, cool. This doesn't look very good, you know, in my opinion, but I mean, it's neat to
4722760	4730040	see like people actually adopting, you know, that platform. But yeah, the fact that they have a code
4730040	4734440	to look at the game instead of like a direct link or something like that kind of makes it difficult
4734440	4744040	to discover things in my opinion, but neat. Yeah. Very interesting that I think it's more
4744040	4748600	interesting that we are seeing commitment to Fortnite as a game development platform.
4748600	4753640	I guess I'm not surprised, but it's kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, this is
4753640	4759400	happening. Oh, this is, we've got commitment. This is something, this is not something where it was
4759400	4763400	a flash in the pan we talk about at one time, like, oh no, people are going to make games for
4763400	4766520	this. So we're going to be talking about the future, which is interesting to me. So we'll see.
4766520	4770920	Yeah. And while this is an interesting story, as far as like this game being in there,
4770920	4775880	what's actually been more popular recently, which is, should be no surprise is a clone of Only Up.
4775880	4782040	And I'm going to tell you, like, if it's anything like Roblox is, clones of other games are
4782040	4786760	basically what you're going to get a ton of in these things. It's just going to be, it's rife
4786760	4793080	with copyright infringement, left and right. Like just blatant free for all.
4793080	4800680	Yeah. All right. Well, moving on to another story here, before we get to something classic,
4800680	4806120	I want to talk about a very interesting future for Blizzard games. You know,
4806120	4810760	Blizzard has historically had its own launcher for games, the Battle.net launcher. Remember when
4810760	4815240	they tried to change the name of that and the users made them change it back to Battle.net?
4815240	4819640	Well, Blizzard has announced that some of their PC games are going to be going to Steam.
4819640	4824200	That's right. Overwatch 2, which is, you know, probably a game that needs a bigger audience,
4824200	4828040	will be coming out for Steam on August 10th, although they have not committed to anything
4828040	4833000	else for the platform yet. In a press release, President Mike Ibarra from Blizzard said,
4833000	4838200	we've heard players want the choice of Steam for a selection of our games. However, something
4838200	4842920	important to note, even though Overwatch 2 is available on Steam, you have to have a Battle.net
4842920	4848920	account in order to play the game. Buy stuff in it. Battle pass. Hello. But also cross-platform
4848920	4855240	play. So to be fair, we've seen Blizzard do a lot more cross-platform games with things like
4855240	4860120	Overwatch 2, right? That was a big deal, is that unlike Overwatch 1, Overwatch 2 is all
4860120	4866200	cross-platform now, as is Diablo 4 versus Diablo 3. So I can see why this is happening now,
4866200	4871000	because Blizzard has that more infrastructure in there for that cross-play. So it's interesting.
4871880	4876840	But yeah, if you're trying to do this to avoid Battle.net altogether, for whatever reason you
4876840	4883160	may have, I don't think this is going to work. But maybe you want it on your Steam deck. That I could
4883160	4888120	see. Now Blizzard did not officially announce Steam deck support, but that doesn't mean people
4888120	4891880	are not going to do whatever they need to do to get it running on that. So that part is going to
4891880	4897400	be very interesting for sure. Overwatch 2 is also getting a big update on the same day, August 10th.
4897960	4902280	That is the day that PvE missions are supposed to start, as well as the new PvP mode and a
4902280	4910840	new hero. It's all called Overwatch 2 Invasion. So that is on the way. What is less on the way,
4910840	4915720	unfortunately, it looks like there's been about 50 esports staff at Activision Blizzard that were
4915720	4925000	laid off around the Overwatch League. The OWL, or Overwatch League, may be changing significantly.
4925000	4930840	It may be ending the city-based franchise format. Nothing is confirmed yet. But employees were
4930840	4936520	informed of layoffs on Tuesday, and a former member of the team told The Verge in an interview
4936520	4941000	that layoffs are out of nowhere, and that a skeleton crew might close out the current
4941000	4946440	Overwatch League and World Series of Warzone seasons. But in a quote saying,
4946440	4951960	in my eyes, they are completely unequipped to internally support anything esports after that.
4951960	4961960	Yikes. So this all also is on the piggyback of Overwatch League waving the franchise fees for
4961960	4968440	teams. Yeah, it looks like they may be trying to consolidate some teams and maybe not do so much of
4968440	4979400	the city-based format. It was at a strong start, but I kind of think the pandemic really kneecap
4979400	4985720	this thing, among other decisions. It went off of Twitch, it went to YouTube, and it kind of
4985720	4993000	keeps moving around. Some were aired on ESPN. I think the grand finals are on ABC at some point,
4993000	4998280	but then COVID-19 happened, and it changed a lot of that. And I don't think it's been able to find
4998280	5006040	its footing ever since, quite frankly. So we'll see. We'll see what happens for 2024 and beyond.
5006040	5012440	But does it end up going the way of Heroes of the Storm? I hope not. That would be very bad news
5012440	5017800	for Overwatch players. It's very sad with Heroes of the Storm. Heroes of the Storm still exists,
5017800	5025240	but if you look at the map for BlizzCon, there's nothing Heroes of the Storm on it,
5025240	5030840	which isn't surprising. But Overwatch has two halls. When SG100map points out,
5030840	5035400	going to be honest, Overwatch 2 being kind of lackluster also hurt it. And that is very true.
5035400	5039640	People did not respond to Overwatch 2 the way that I think Blizzard expected them to.
5040440	5046680	Changing the feature set probably didn't help, but that all plays into it as well. So
5047560	5052040	we'll see what happens. I mean, I've played a little bit of Overwatch and it's fine,
5052040	5056520	but I also haven't given Overwatch any money since I bought the original game when it was
5056520	5062760	the more traditional model of a $50 game to buy. And that was how many years ago at this point?
5062760	5067880	So I'm going to be honest, I'm not going to buy the battle pass. I'm not really interested in any
5067880	5075800	of that stuff. So we'll see. We'll see. All right. Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane in our
5075800	5081480	next segment to a time when we didn't have to worry about season passes, battle passes,
5081480	5086200	esports, none of that. It was a very different time. So let's roll the bumper.
5096440	5101960	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5101960	5106840	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5106840	5110200	And what did you pick this week, DarkSakura?
5112360	5120760	Live Alive, the original from 1994 for Super Famicom. It was developed by Square
5122040	5131400	and it's a very interesting game. I had started playing it back in the day and never
5131400	5135080	really made it that far. So now I'm officially playing it and have made it through
5135720	5140760	the prehistoric part of it, which we're actually watching right now. This is actually what I
5140760	5148280	streamed on yesterday, Saturday. But anyway, it came out in 94. It's a role-playing game
5148280	5155080	developed by Square for the Super Famicom. Yes, there is a remake that was done by Esquenix
5156040	5160520	for the Switch that came out last year and also then PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows.
5161160	5169800	So it follows seven different scenarios across different time periods with two other unlockable
5169800	5179480	scenarios that link all of these narratives together with this reoccurring antagonist named
5179480	5187080	Odio. You explore for a little bit and have different story twists and then there's
5187080	5192600	turn-based combat that's played on a grid and it's kind of weird. I'll just tell you right now.
5192600	5196680	It took a little bit to get used to and it's really frustrating when you're trying to move
5196680	5200920	into position and then somebody attacks like someone else and you have to wait to make your
5200920	5208760	move. It's ridiculous. But the game was really well received. The unique gameplay and the narrative
5209320	5216280	was also very highly lauded though the game is not a very long game. The remake was also brought
5216280	5223640	in very well. Although some people are saying that there are some gameplay elements that did not age
5223640	5232360	well. The original sold 270,000 units and was considered a failure. However, the remake sold
5233240	5251320	500,000 copies. Also, the director Tokida Takashi went to use his time from Live Alive
5251320	5257800	into other games. The brief run-through on some of those other games we are looking at
5257800	5265400	Final Fantasy III on NES, Final Fantasy IV, V, Chrono Trigger,
5266520	5270600	Parasite E, Chocobo Racing. I'm trying to find some more recent stuff.
5271640	5279080	Final Fantasy IV DS, Final Fantasy IV The After Years, Dissidia Final Fantasy Theatrhythm Curtain
5279080	5287880	Call, The New Live Alive, Future of the Final Bar Line, Octopath Traveler 2. So, those are
5287880	5294520	other things he's been involved in. At any rate, you basically take a role of one of eight different
5294520	5300920	protagonists through nine scenarios. So, each narrative does have the same basic mechanics.
5300920	5308280	Each of the story has different gimmicks. One can use stealth. One can use telepathy.
5310120	5316440	With all but one scenario, you are navigating through themed environments from an overworld
5316440	5321720	area to dungeon environments and the battles are triggered differently for each scenario.
5322920	5329720	Some are random. Some have sprites you can avoid and others are very well scripted. For example,
5331320	5335640	do you see, well, I mean, for those who are watching how you see these little
5335640	5341480	clouds poke around, you actually sniff to find out where your enemies are and so you
5341480	5345480	have an idea of how to go right into a battle or how to avoid one.
5347560	5356040	For the record, the cave people speak in thought bubbles and grunting and smelling.
5356040	5365000	Yeah, they have smell-o-vision. It is a turn-based system for the fight and you're on a seven by
5365000	5372200	seven grid where you can move around, perform different actions like attacking or healing or
5373000	5379080	different ranged works. Your skills can use without limit, though some do take multiple
5379080	5385560	turns to charge. And some of the abilities can give you extra properties such as
5386440	5391080	dealing elemental damage or healing or increasing your power.
5393240	5400840	You also gain skills with experience points that unlocks new abilities. Some of the progression is
5400840	5407320	locked away behind story events. Sometimes the techniques are learned by watching other people
5407320	5413880	use them. And then you can also equip and use items and have accessories that boost your attack
5413880	5421640	or other items to recover health. And if your character or the party is defeated, the game ends,
5421640	5430280	of course. So the remake has the basic gameplay carried over, although it's a new graphic style.
5431080	5437960	And some of the changes are just there for ease of use. You have like health bars and whatnot,
5437960	5443000	but honestly enough, I kind of liked getting the alert right at the beginning of the match
5443000	5449560	and then just trying to mentally keep track of it. So the different chapters that you have,
5449560	5455640	and I know I've kept mentioning the prehistoric, but you also have ancient China, feudal Japan,
5456440	5461800	the wild west, the present day, the near future, and the distant future.
5463800	5474120	And the protagonist has to fight an enemy whose name is or incorporates ODIO. Like the last one
5474920	5483880	in this one was O-D-O or IO or something. It was like that. There is an eighth chapter set
5483880	5489240	in the middle ages, which in turn will unlock a final chapter that brings all the narratives
5489240	5496920	together. So in prehistory, you play as Pogo with his ugly ass gorilla friend named Gori.
5499080	5506920	And you have to rescue a girl named Belle. They say Beru here. I've always just known
5506920	5514840	to this Belle. But she was supposed to be sacrificed by the rival tribe to their
5514840	5525160	dinosaur god, Odo. Get it? So all the same names. You have an Oloshihu in the imperial China,
5525160	5532440	looking for a successor. The Edo Japan, the infiltrator, you have a ninja, a Boromaru,
5533160	5537720	having to rescue an important person and kill the captor.
5542120	5551960	And the wild west, you have the wanderer who has a showdown. You have the strongest who is
5551960	5556360	in the present day with this guy who wants to be the strongest person in the world, thinking
5556360	5561320	that defeating enemies in each fighting style will help them get his goal. The near future is
5561320	5572600	the outsider with a psychic named Tadokoro Akira. You have the distant future, the mechanical heart,
5572600	5579320	where you're on a ship called Cognito Ergo Sum, I think therefore I am. And you play a maintenance
5579320	5585320	robot named Cube. And then in the middle ages, you play the knight Orsted. And I won't go more
5585320	5590600	into that without going into spoiler territory. Anyway, it was developed by development division
5590600	5597480	five of Square, also the folks who did the Final Fantasy series, and was the directorial debut of
5597480	5603880	Tokida Takashi, who had also worked as a designer for Hanjoku Hero in Final Fantasy IV.
5605080	5611960	And the concept was born from when they make an RPG where people could experience multiple stories
5611960	5619240	at once instead of the smaller stories going into a grand narrative. And it was made by expanding
5619240	5626520	the storage capacity of the Super Famicom ROM so that players could finish each part during the
5626520	5634920	day. And for the record, I finished the caveman in basically two and a half hours. That's even
5634920	5643880	with having to start over on part of it. The designer for this was Inoue Nobuyuki and the
5644120	5651560	programmer Fukuye Fumiaki. They had also worked on those other games with Tokida,
5652200	5660280	and they began development December 1993. And the whole thing took a year and a half and was
5660280	5669720	produced for a Super Famicom 16 megabit cartridge. But Tokida had to adjust to being a director. He
5669720	5676360	was more used to being hands-on for graphic elements. And so the hands-off approach was
5676360	5683640	a little bit hard. And originally the scenarios had a graduating difficulty scale, but it was
5683640	5687960	abandoned so that players could tackle the scenarios in any orders that they wished.
5687960	5697800	And basically, the battle system in there was intended to be a strategic experience,
5697800	5704760	and Tokida described it as real-life shogi. So that's kind of cool. And they wanted to not
5704760	5710200	show the hit points, but have the characters act like they had been injured or looked weakened as
5711080	5719160	they took damage. And then, of course, after it was done, the team split up to do other projects.
5721720	5728840	And I'm not going to go too much more into the characters on there, but some of the
5729960	5734120	characters were based on pop culture figures. Like, for example,
5735000	5741880	one of the characters was based off Oda Nobunaga.
5744840	5750440	One of the characters was also working on Basara and lended her work to the character design.
5753080	5759400	And Orseb was directly based on the Warrior of Light from the Final Fantasy series. So,
5759480	5765960	anyway, we also had influences by Devilman, Dragon Quest IV, First Human,
5767480	5776600	Giatris, and also some nods to Stanley Kubrick in there. So, anyway, the music in this game was also
5776600	5784200	done by the amazing Shinomura Yoko, who had left some of Capcom's projects after working on Street
5784200	5791000	Fighter II and moved to Square to do music for RPGs. And Live Alive was her first major RPG
5791000	5801320	composition, which I believe I mentioned in a previous episode. So, of course, there was also
5801320	5807640	some input by Uematsu Nobuo, as in the Final Fantasy composer who helped her out with
5808600	5816120	getting everything laid out. And some of the songs in the game were available as downloadable
5816120	5823640	content for Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call, and some of the songs were included in
5823640	5832120	a tribute concert. So, Live Alive was released on September 2, 1994, meant to be released before
5832360	5842440	Final Fantasy 6, but there were delays, and so it was released after that. But there was
5842440	5853000	a prequel manga that preceded the distant future scenario, and that it was actually
5853000	5859080	done without Square's permission. The game was re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console for Wii U
5859080	5868760	on June 17, 2015. Virtual Console port to 3DS was November 28, 2016. And then more people were
5868760	5875400	demanding the title, so they had to get permission from the guest illustrators and make sure the
5875400	5882600	re-release could happen. And the characters from Live Alive were featured in the 20th anniversary
5882600	5888760	crossovers with the mobile game Holy Dungeon and Final Fantasy Legends The Space Time Crystal.
5890440	5894280	So, the remake, I'm not going to go too much on the remake because that's not classic yet,
5894840	5901880	but the remake was built using Unreal Engine. Everything was updated in it. It had in-game
5901880	5909320	radars and maps, and the character designs were redrawn by Ikushima Naoki. And, of course,
5909320	5916120	Shinomura came back to orchestrate and rearrange the soundtrack. The original MIDI sound files were
5916120	5924360	lost, so basically she had to copy from the original and remake them. There's also the New
5924360	5932040	Future chapter had a vocal version of the theme Gogo Buriki Daioh, and it was done by Kageyama
5932040	5938840	Hironobu, who is best known for performing the Dragon Ball Z opening, Cha La Head Cha La, which
5938840	5946360	is actually one of my favorite anime openings ever. But, anyway, you know, like I said, not the best
5946360	5951960	received, but it was generally favorable. I can already tell just from playing through the
5951960	5962280	caveman scenario why it never got a US release, you know, between gorilla humping and eating
5962280	5969240	people and the naked man who wears a thong made out of a lizard, a live lizard, and explosive fart
5969240	5977240	jokes. Yeah, probably a reason. But, yeah, that's the game. Live Alive. I will, if anyone's interested
5977240	5984680	in seeing it on Tuesday, I will be starting. I think I'm going to do the cowboy, so be there.
5985320	5990600	All right, yeehaw. There it is. Not yeehaw people, but just yeehaw.
5991640	5997160	Classic game of the week, Live Alive, which is, yeah, I keep meaning to check out the remake
5997160	6001720	at some point, and I just haven't gotten around to it because, you know, endless backlog of games.
6001720	6010920	It happens. Yeah. Hey, Rob, real quick. Yeah. I found out that there are now analysis applications,
6010920	6014280	one of them by Intel, that's meant to search for deep fakes.
6016600	6022600	Basically, it's combatting AI rendered video. Perfect. Perfect.
6022600	6025000	But I've thrown that in since that's been a point of contention.
6025000	6030280	Yeah. By the way, before we get into rapid fire news, you know, I know we've been talking about
6030280	6034280	that I'm going to this convention this upcoming weekend, and I got Dragon Con. I should also point
6034280	6039800	out, and I was going to ask, because Alan and I got our TwitchCon tickets this week. Did you pick
6039800	6042680	yours up yet, DarkSucker? I assumed you were going. Maybe I shouldn't assume.
6042680	6043240	I did.
6043240	6043800	Okay.
6043800	6047560	I did, and now that's why I'm doing marathons so that I can actually eat
6048760	6053960	while I'm there and do my cosplay. But yeah, I bought my tickets.
6053960	6054460	Nice.
6055880	6062040	I believe it or not, I've actually made enough this year so far that I could buy my tickets
6062040	6062520	flat out.
6062520	6063080	Oh, that's great.
6063080	6063800	I was very happy.
6063800	6068440	Congrats. So that's awesome. Well, TwitchCon Vegas is coming up in October,
6068440	6071720	so that will be another opportunity to see myself in DarkSucker, although we don't
6072680	6078760	really work with it in any official capacity or anything like that. So it's what it is.
6081240	6090520	All right. And Bobby, no. So moving on, let's get into rapid fire news.
6091080	6092120	So, Loki, we'll start with you.
6093000	6100840	All right. So Death Stranding DLC, or I guess bonus content, is coming to Fall Guys.
6101640	6111400	So I really like the Sam Bridges costume that they have with the teeny tiny little bean baby
6111400	6117800	that's in there. That's pretty awesome. But yeah, you can get the standard issue Bridges
6117800	6127240	SDT suit that's in there. And yeah, looks cute. When is it coming? It's already come out.
6128200	6132440	It's part of the July 18th update. So nice.
6132440	6136840	Great. By the way, Loki, I completely see what you did there. You switched the game behind you
6136840	6139880	to one of the many Barbie video games there at some point.
6139880	6141320	It's Barbie Horse Adventures.
6141320	6145880	All right. Perfect. Perfect. All right. Moving on, DarkSucker.
6145880	6155160	So if anyone is a fan of the Google Doodle, there is Space Invaders World Defense, actually, which
6156360	6163720	is an augmented reality version of the game and has worked with Taito for mobile devices.
6163720	6170200	So this is actually being put out by Google for the 45th anniversary. This is basically
6171080	6177960	much bigger than just having the doodle to commemorate it.
6179480	6186280	But you basically can go around shooting Space Invaders in real time using your phone. Huzzah.
6188520	6192520	Good times. Yeah, I downloaded that to check it out. But it didn't look like it actually
6192520	6195640	used like landmarks or anything. It was just more of an AR Space Invaders game,
6195640	6197160	which was cute for a minute.
6198120	6201320	I mean, that's what it was described as. So I guess it did the bill.
6201320	6207080	Yeah. All right. And then one more thing to talk about. And that would be, do you remember a few
6207080	6211640	weeks ago when we were talking about the surprise that the Dolphin emulator was going to be coming
6211640	6218440	out for Steam and we were like, Valve's going to allow that? And as it turns out, LOL, JK,
6218440	6225640	Valve is not actually going to allow it at all. What happened in this case, there was no DMCA or
6225640	6231160	anything like that. But Valve's legal department did contact Nintendo. And there was, you may
6231160	6236760	remember this, they did reach out proactively to see about this whole thing. Valve forwarded
6236760	6241960	a statement from Nintendo's lawyers to the Dolphin team and said they could only launch the emulator
6241960	6250440	if Nintendo approved. So the part of the legal letter said, we specifically request that Dolphins
6250440	6255800	coming soon notice be removed and that you ensure the emulator does not release on the Steam store
6255800	6261320	moving forward. And does that surprise any of us? Probably not. I think more of us were surprised
6261320	6265880	that it ended up on the store in the first place, but it will not be coming to the Steam store.
6267160	6272120	On a related note, Nintendo has still not done anything to address the lack of backwards
6272120	6279400	compatibility and playing some of the old games on these systems. But I guess some people just don't
6279400	6286520	care about that. Moving on, let's check out what is coming out around the world in a segment we
6286520	6295480	call world release dates. So Loki will go to you. All right. So we've got a few games. So starting
6295480	6304200	off with Mr. Run and Jump on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series,
6304200	6312040	and the Atari VCS. We have the Queen's Gambit Chess on iOS and Android,

6429560	6433880	and I believe that is it. All right, well going to Japan,
6434520	6439560	love this on the Nintendo Switch, You Suck at Parking comes out this week on the Nintendo
6439560	6443160	Switch. Oh man, that's the game that all the Americans play. I know, several people that
6443160	6447160	need that game. Well, you could, it's a multi-language edition, it isn't limited to
6447160	6451320	Japanese, but yeah, You Suck at Parking is coming out from GameSource Entertainment,
6451320	6456840	and yes, it is not a racing game, it's about parking, so. Anyway, also coming out on the
6456840	6461240	Nintendo Switch this week in Japan on July 27th, Cry Machina is out in a regular and
6461240	6467160	limited edition, Deep One also in a regular and limited edition, Hanasaki Works Spring,

6480360	6486280	Yuoni, and those are the Switch releases in Japan this week. Heading over to the PlayStation 5,

6489800	6496120	Cry Machina also out on the PS5, that Hayarigami 123 Pack is out as well,
6496680	6499880	all that in Japan this week. Pretty busy week, all things considered.
6501160	6505320	S2100 Matt in chat says, remember you park like an asshole. I used to have those fake
6505320	6510200	ticket printed up to put on folks' windows. No, but, and I know I've told this story on
6510200	6515000	the show before, I'm going to tell it again, I remember the first Live 365 Awards that we went to
6515000	6519320	when we parked next to some guy that parked like an asshole and Dark Sakura left them a note on
6519320	6523160	some Hello Kitty post-its that I had in my car that let them know you park like an asshole.
6524600	6527480	Do you remember that? I remember that too because I thought it was the funniest thing
6528120	6530440	because I just, I happened to have Hello Kitty post-its.
6531480	6538360	I remember, you remember my friend Julie, right? Of course. I saw her a year ago at a Pokemon ride.
6539080	6545080	Really? Well, I just remember that she and I were taking the same Japanese class
6545960	6554280	and someone had just parked completely impossibly bad, like really bad. And she took out honey
6554280	6565960	packets and poured them all over the handle of their car door. And then put salt on it.
6566680	6570520	Yeah, I'm passive aggressive notes. I can't get sued.
6570520	6571480	Don't piss off Julie.
6571480	6571980	Yeah.
6572680	6575240	That's, that's, that's Julie anger.
6575960	6578760	All right. How about the UK release dates, which hopefully don't lead to anger.
6579480	6587720	All right. On the 25th for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, we have Remnant 2.
6588520	6600520	On the 27th for PlayStation Switch and Xbox, Double Dragon Gaiden, Rise of the Dragons.
6603240	6609560	Also on the 28th for Switch, we have Disney Illusion Island, PlayStation Ghost Song,
6610280	6614040	and for PlayStation and Switch Cuphead limited edition.
6614040	6619640	All right. All right. We just have a few more news stories for you, and then we'll see if
6619640	6624200	anyone wants to give us a call tonight over on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com
6624200	6631080	slash discord. But first we do have some more news and this game keeps trickling out the news
6631080	6633640	to keep it as a headline every week. Pretty exciting. Yeah.
6633640	6638760	Yeah. So there was a whole rumored story about Homelander joining Mortal Kombat. Well,
6638760	6646440	that's not all. So they finally made the announcement of the Mortal Kombat, their first
6646440	6654040	DLC pack that's gonna contain well, Homelander from the boys. And then a really awesome matchup
6654040	6662600	with Homelander's Omni-Man, who is from the show Invincible. And, you know, also voiced by JK
6662600	6673160	Simmons. So it's gonna be amazing. Then we have Peacemaker, Quan Chi, Ermac, and Takeda.
6674440	6680760	Oh, well, that's cool because I kind of missed having him in the last Mortal Kombat,
6680760	6683880	in Mortal Kombat 11. There was a lot of talk of him.
6685320	6690920	Yeah. So there's a whole like there's, I remember like with like Invincible and the boys and stuff,
6690920	6695880	there was all these like kind of like fantasy matchups like, well, this Superman type character
6695880	6699880	versus this other Superman type character and they're both evil. Who's gonna win? So we're
6699880	6706680	gonna see a lot of, you know, Homelander versus Omni-Man. It's gonna be amazing.
6708920	6714920	And I don't know when it's coming out yet, but it looks fantastic. Oh, September 14th
6715720	6722040	is when Mortal Kombat 1 releases. And then the combat pack, not sure when that's coming out yet.
6723880	6727320	I would feel like it's gonna be there the day it comes out, but maybe it will be.
6727320	6731960	Maybe. Yeah. And it comes with the collector's edition or premium edition as well.
6731960	6738120	Yeah. So, but that's right around the corner, but that's how they do those games. NetherRealm
6738120	6740680	just announces it like three months before it's gonna come out. And then they just,
6740680	6744440	they hit it hard with the announcements leading up to the release date. They actually do a really
6744520	6750280	good job of teasing and releasing their games. So I would love to see like a whole versus series
6750280	6756040	with all these different superhero shows. Like let's get, let's get like Invincible versus,
6756040	6761240	you know, the boys versus, I don't know, whatever else. Throw them all together. Hey, hey, you know
6761240	6766200	what? Let's just bring back heroes. Why not? Let's have heroes come back in too. And then just have
6766200	6770040	a big fighting game with all these different superhero TV shows. I'd be down with that.
6770840	6774360	Def points out, we'll probably get more news at Evo, which yeah, that's coming up
6774360	6781160	first weekend of August. So that is a very, very good forecasting as well for sure.
6781160	6781660	Yeah.
6782600	6786760	All right. Well, I think this is, this next story is really funny to me. Dark Sakura.
6789720	6793160	Neopets. I had them. You had them.
6793160	6796760	I had them. Yeah. All the omelets for my Neopets.
6796840	6803560	Neopets are going through a reinvention and I don't know how I feel about this artwork.
6803560	6810760	In fact, I don't really care for it. I liked the old artwork. So anyway, the,
6812920	6820840	the new management behind that is looking to reinvigorate the world of Neopia. On July 18th,
6820840	6831000	they they had the world of Neopia which had a lengthy blog post by the Neopets team that was
6831000	6837240	talking about the future of the franchise, the abandonment of Metaverse and NFT plans.
6837960	6841240	So yeah, I'm not interested the moment that NFT got brought in.
6842120	6843480	Well, good thing it's leaving.
6843480	6847800	They basically fixed the flash problem.
6847800	6848300	Yeah.
6851080	6851580	Yeah.
6852120	6852620	Oh, good.
6853320	6865080	And wow, $500 Neopets NFTs are no, no thank you. But basically after fixing the flash thing though,
6865080	6875400	is that they're two big initiatives were pretty much hated. The thing that they had released
6875400	6881960	didn't line up with the things that made people like Neopets. And so they're dropping whatever
6881960	6887800	that was. And they're going to do a mobile game called World of Neopets, which is a social life
6887800	6893000	simulation game where you live your ideal Neopian life from the perspective of a Neopet.
6896520	6898840	They're still leaving though the old Neopets
6899240	6907160	are intact. And they're going to do some things with the old style one. The new site
6907160	6913000	was actually should have launched a few days ago, July 20, to be a one stop shop for all
6913000	6917880	brand announcements and all the stuff. So I don't know how I feel about it. You know what?
6920040	6925720	Well, it's, I'm happy that evil was defeated with NFTs. So that's, you know, and it's it,
6925720	6931000	this is not the first time we've seen the gaming companies retreat from NFTs now recently. So I
6931000	6938680	feel like this, like this NFT thing was a flash in the fucking pan. Like it, it's, yeah, it's
6939480	6943880	going as far as leaving as fast as it came in. So don't let the door hit you.
6945720	6948600	All right. Rest in pyramid heads lasagna.
6949480	6949980	Loki.
6951320	6957400	All right. So apparently there's been a leak of some of the developer data on Roblox. So there
6957400	6964040	was about 4000 developers who had their personal identifiable information leaked to the public.
6964040	6970840	These were folks that attended the Roblox developer conferences between 2017 and 2020.
6971480	6976200	And it had everything basically all of their personal information that you could imagine
6976200	6981720	that would be in there. They said even they kind of brag about the ridiculousness of it,
6981720	6988920	even t-shirt sizes. So apparently they have notified everybody that has been affected by it,
6988920	6999960	but you know, it still sucks. So they pledged to continue to be vigilant. But you know,
6999960	7005480	all the vigilance that you can possibly muster is not going to help it when all their personal
7005480	7010200	information is leaked out. SSJ 100 Matt sums up the
7010200	7013080	comments on this article perfectly by saying, Oof.
7018040	7023400	Exactly. That comment's really funny. It is pretty good.
7023400	7028280	It's pretty good. All right. That should really just be the headline. All right.
7030840	7035000	Moving on to one more story. Another one of these things that, you know, is showing up in our
7035000	7039880	industry more and more is AI, or machine learning, if you will, but we all know everyone's calling
7039880	7046760	it AI. I think this is really funny. So some Redditors have ended up trolling a content farm
7046760	7052440	to report on a fake World of Warcraft feature that doesn't actually exist.
7054200	7060840	Okay, so there's this website called the portal, which is a blog that publishes gaming content
7060840	7067320	powered by z league. That is basically all just cover for machine learning AI generated bullshit.
7067320	7074520	But what's funny is that so so a Redditor noticed that the portal website was taking discussions
7074520	7080600	from gaming sub subreddits and turn them into blog posts. So what they did is that they made
7080600	7088360	a fake post and other Redditors played along, as did Blizzard developers in this whole thing.
7088920	7095080	And sure enough, article gets posted World of Warcraft players excited for Glorbo's
7095080	7107000	introduction. Glorbo is not anything that actually exists. So um, but now of course, now this is the
7107000	7111080	big joke. Now everybody's talking about Glorbo. And now here we are talking about Glorbo. And
7111080	7118440	guess what it doesn't fucking exist. So a Blizzard has actually been contacted to see if
7118440	7124280	they will actually address the hype for Glorbo and bring the feature into Wow, it would be a very
7124280	7129640	funny like they can't actually do it as a feature but it would be a really funny like pet flavor
7129640	7135400	text or something like that like something just a little wink and a nod I think or an item like
7135400	7140840	Glorbo's ring of sorcery or something would be really funny to put in the game at this point.
7141320	7147160	Didn't they do that with like the sword that was supposed to be in that South Park episode?
7147160	7151480	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, they do that. They do that shit all the time. All the time. Bobby
7151480	7157880	Blackpool points out that the article actually references the AI bot. So this is a great way to
7157880	7164280	break AI bots. And I think it's funny and we should keep doing it. CNET had to correct AI
7164280	7173160	generated finance posts because errors were found. Gizmodo, Geo media had that forging ahead with AI
7173160	7177880	generated blog posts, even though they got things wrong, like a chronological list of Star Wars
7177880	7184760	movies and TV shows wrong. AI is not ready in the way that companies want it to be ready. And I think
7184760	7193000	they're going to find out the hard way about this for sure. So Bobby says they then made another
7193000	7198360	post on Reddit worrying about AI bot news sites. And the same site made a post about wow players
7198360	7203640	worried about AI bot news sites. This is so good. It's getting so meta. Yeah. They just,
7203640	7207880	then they need, what they need to do then is reference that site and discuss about that.
7207880	7212680	And then it'll go one step deeper and they just have to keep going with it. Yeah. So,
7214680	7220040	it doesn't seem to be going anyway, away anytime soon, but some, some folks are believing, you
7220040	7224200	know, if you want to, you know, believe in the future of AI, some believe that AI could help
7224200	7228440	combat misinformation by, you know, assisting newsrooms with fact checking, but, you know,
7228440	7233560	I'll believe when I see it, cause right now it's not there yet. So, but we'll see, we'll see what
7233560	7239080	can come of it. I think it just depends, again, it depends on how the machine learns. It's very
7239080	7243720	clear that this thing got its pants pulled down for pulling all of its information from Reddit
7243720	7248920	and everything that was generated from there. So, Bobby actually links us to the article.
7249560	7254120	Oh yeah. This is great. So, this is from an archive cause obviously I'm sure the article
7254120	7260440	got pulled at some point, but this is actually at the portal where Glorbo is introduced into the
7260440	7265720	game. And again, it's, it's the most generic thing where it's just like, wow, players are buzzing
7265720	7270600	with excitement because this introduction it's there. Here are the key takeaways like,
7270600	7278200	like an AI bot would do. Some players have reservations about the mandatory item,
7278200	7284680	kick clack. That's gotta be a rearranged letter word of something. I don't know. This is really
7284680	7289960	funny. Glorbo's impact on the game. Honestly, this new feature makes me happy. I just want
7289960	7294280	some major bot operated news websites to publish an article about this.
7300280	7301400	Oh, it's funny.
7301400	7302440	Ah, it's so good.
7304200	7305720	Keep it up. Keep it up, Reddit.
7305720	7306840	But it really isn't good.
7308280	7311400	No, the prank is good. The prank is good.
7311400	7315800	The prank is great, but I mean, and it really does bring attention to it,
7316440	7321960	but at the same time, the fact that it exists, that it's trying, you know, that people have
7321960	7328920	programmed it to basically try to beat a human reporter to the punch.
7332360	7337320	No, I think it's great that it catches this company with its pants pulled down and just
7337320	7344680	shows how this can be exploited. Big issue with machine learning and learning. You can exploit it.
7346360	7349880	That's what this shows right now. So just food for thought, food for thought.
7350840	7356120	All right. Anyway, with that, let's get to the list of round table where we invite your calls
7356120	7362040	over at vognetwork.com slash discord. We also invite your emails every week to our mailbag,
7362040	7367400	participate at orange lounge, radio.com. And we like to read those emails on the show.
7367400	7370040	Dark soccer. Did you want to do that now? Or you want to finish eating while I bring on a collar?
7371240	7372520	Okay, so let's get to it.
7372520	7375400	It's got pepperoni on it. So now it's making me kind of meh.
7377960	7384840	All right. First email. Would Silent Hill 3 be the first of what we refer to as mascot horror
7384840	7390920	games? Or is there a significant predecessor? That's from Robert M. Kinda. I mean, it's not
7390920	7398600	really the first. We had splatter house. Oh, good call. And of course, I mean, any of the
7398600	7404120	games that were based off the movie franchises, you know, I mean, even Halloween had a game.
7405720	7410760	Nightmare on Elm street had one. There was a Friday the 13th game. Not that they were any good,
7410760	7417640	but. But yeah, I mean, I think splatter house is a great call out.
7418520	7422120	Yeah. Splatter house was the first one that comes off of my head. I mean,
7422120	7429320	you also think about early Diablo. Oh yeah. Yeah. Think about.
7432920	7436440	What about like phantasmagoria? I don't know if that's not really,
7436440	7441800	I think that's phantasmagoria. Really have like a mascot to it. Although I love phantasmagoria.
7441800	7449640	That's a great game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was. Well, I mean, doom kinda.
7450760	7455800	I was trying to think if there's anything from that PC, like CD rom point and click era,
7455800	7458840	you know, when I think about things like seventh guests, but I guess, I guess it's, you're right.
7458840	7464120	It's not really like the brand is the kind of the mascot. They're not really any particular
7464120	7467800	character. Like I couldn't tell you what the main character's name was in that game at this point.
7468600	7475960	In golden acts, death adder. Oh, okay. But that's not, that's not
7475960	7479400	horror though. I don't know. Well, I loose interpret it loose.
7479400	7485880	Medieval horror, I guess. But I mean, but yeah, splatter house would be the first one
7485880	7488440	that came to mind. Yeah. No great call. Great call out.
7489240	7497400	All right. So next email. Hey yo, O L R doing my part and emailing the show
7497480	7502680	with a fun question and also sent us doggos. Thank you for the doggo. Doggo is cute.
7504440	7510120	Lego has been venturing into gaming theme sets in recent years. Most notably they have themed
7510120	7514680	playsets of super Mario brothers, as well as scaled builds of actual consoles like the NES,
7514680	7519800	the Atari 2,600, and recently a Pac-Man arcade machine with moving functions.
7520360	7526680	So my question to you all is what gaming series or gaming inspired set would you like to be
7527240	7533240	seen, uh, would you like to see be made into a Lego set? I personally really like the console
7533240	7538360	builds with the movable actions, like the NES TV. So I would like to see maybe a classic game
7538360	7546120	boy build with a small crank function, granted the beauty of Legos that one could make their own set,
7546120	7552040	but I just prefer throwing money at Lego whenever possible. Haha. Anyways, thank you for the show
7552040	7560440	as usual. Be well and stay awesome friends. SSJ 100 Matt. Um, great question. Um, I went a
7560440	7567880	Silent Hill diorama. That's a good one. I'm going to be predictable and say Metroid. I think for me
7567880	7572120	that's pretty predictable. Um, but you know what, you know what random like thing popped into my
7572120	7578840	head was Faxanadu. Um, that is very random. I know, but like, remember like some of those,
7578840	7583480	like the trees and the way the stages were built. It was, if you remember the, the Lauren that game
7583480	7586520	was about like climbing these trees and things like that. I don't know why. Like, I just think
7586520	7589880	that would make like an awesome Lego set, but you know, you want it obscure. Here you go.
7591000	7595400	I think we're gonna, I mean, I would be really surprised if they didn't do a Legend of Zelda
7595400	7601320	set at some time too. There is, there is supposed to be one, it leaked out. It was the, uh,
7601320	7607560	great Deku tree. Um, that was going to be the thing they have like product shots of it. They
7607560	7613240	just haven't announced it yet. Um, so that is coming. And remember there was Overwatch,
7613240	7619560	there is Super Mario Brothers stuff. There's also Sonic coming very soon. So they've done a lot in
7619560	7625880	gaming recently. I would like to see something along the lines of, um, I'd like them to do a
7625880	7632680	pinball machine, like honestly like a functioning pinball machine. Yeah, they could do it. Get some,
7632760	7637000	like, uh, they're like, not technics stuff. I mean, it would be some technic stuff in there,
7637000	7640920	but like some of the stuff that they have with like the robot creation sets and stuff
7640920	7646360	where you could really get it to be functional. Well, I know people have made them, but like,
7646360	7652040	I mean, I want to see Lego make one. Um, I think it would be really cool, uh, more practical,
7652040	7660280	like Mega Man or, um, you know, Zelda. It was actually themed around their, uh, astronaut
7660280	7668600	made with 15,000 bricks and this thing would be pretty damn expensive, but I'll,
7668600	7674280	I'll link it in the chat room for whoever wants to see it. Um, it's pretty cool.
7675480	7679560	I would love to have like there, you know how they did do the, the Pac-Man one, like it's,
7679560	7684920	it's fun as the crank stuff goes with that, like team up with one of those, like console,
7684920	7689080	like the tiny little console makers and make like you build the cabinet, but it's an actual
7689080	7693400	full functioning little mini cabinet or something like that would be really cool.
7693400	7698520	That'd be great. As big of a fan of the cabinet ones. I mean, I think that they're neat looking,
7698520	7704200	but I would rather have just like a nice diorama. I really would like to have a nice diorama.
7704840	7718120	Um, so, uh, next up, um, come on, open up. Um, hi, OLR. I have just been a podcast listener
7718120	7722760	for a very long time. The live show is just too late for me. You have been a part of my
7722760	7728440	podcast rotation for 15 plus years. I'm not sure how long, but I found this show back on all games.
7729320	7735640	10 years ago in 2013, my wife, Tracy died. That time I did call in. I remember that.
7735640	7740360	Now I have the best news ever. Last month, my daughter brought my first granddaughter
7740360	7745000	into the world. I'm so happy for the addition to the family. I'm not really gaming right now,
7745000	7752200	but I do keep up on the news with OLR weekly. Thank you for all you do. I don't know if I
7752200	7758040	should say the full name, so I'm just going to see Steven. No, I definitely, I remember that call
7758040	7763960	because, um, that was, I'm sure an incredibly difficult period, um, for you to go through. So,
7763960	7769400	um, you know, I'm, I'm glad to hear things are, are great these days for you and that you have,
7769400	7773480	uh, the family continuing to grow. That's great. Thanks for reaching out. Cause I believe this was
7773480	7779320	the only emailer that actually listened to my pleas for lurkers to email us. So Steven,
7779320	7784040	you get the gold star email of the week award. Yay. Although I appreciate the other emails as
7784040	7789720	well. We do hear from those individuals, uh, somewhat frequently. So I appreciate
7789720	7794600	a lurker, uh, un-lurking to, uh, send that other email. I want to say that we made friends through
7794840	7803560	live journal. Oh, I'm sure. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. With this person. Yeah. Um, I'm pretty sure I see them
7803560	7810840	on the book of faces too. So, um, and for the record, I have started the disentangle my
7810840	7817720	entanglement process and I'm taking the bird with me. Oh, oh, the bird app, which actually is not
7817720	7822360	going to be the bird app as of, you know, tomorrow. It sounds like, cause now it's, you know,
7822360	7828920	X marks the spot for the term has become a generic. Yeah. It's ingrained. It's like
7828920	7834360	Xeroxing. I'm always going to call it bird app. Here's the thing it's for, as far as I'm concerned,
7834360	7838920	it's Arco arena. And if you live in Sacramento, you a hundred percent know, like we all do,
7838920	7841960	you a hundred percent know what I mean when I say it's like Arco arena, because
7842600	7846360	where the Kings used to play, not their current place with the beam and all that shit,
7846360	7851480	but where they used to play, uh, in, in a little bit more of a suburb area of Sacramento,
7851480	7855880	though it's still considered Sacramento proper, the big arena. Yeah. The big arena that they
7855880	7862440	built there was called Arco arena was actually the first sponsored name arena in history.
7862440	7868120	Fun fact, because what happens there? I think, uh, no, cause it's now a pile of rubble. Uh,
7868120	7874360	it is going to be a hospital soon. Yeah. But, uh, so Arco arena, they lost the naming rights.
7874360	7877640	Fun fact, it was going to be the seven up arena. And at the last minute, the,
7877640	7881320	the naming deal changed. I know somebody who was on the deal for that. I learned all these
7881560	7885880	useless facts about it, but anyway, the name like Arco is gasoline. If you don't already know,
7885880	7890440	cause I don't know if that exists nationwide, terrible gas. Yeah. We Alan and I call it PP gas,
7890440	7895720	but it is it's cheap cause letting your car run on PP, but it is cheap. Very, very cheap gas.
7895720	7898840	I don't know if it's nationwide or not. So that's why I wanted to give that explanation.
7899720	7906120	So, um, yeah. So the arena was called Arco arena, but then they lost the naming rights after like
7906120	7910520	10 years or something like that. And it was called, I think, wasn't the name after it,
7910520	7915160	power balance, balance. Pavilion. Wasn't that the next name, which was after those
7915160	7920440	fucking wristbands or something that were like, it was terrible. And then I think it became this
7920440	7925880	like, and what happened was that everyone refused to call it that it was still Arco arena,
7925880	7929880	even though they would welcome you to, we'd say, uh, yeah, it's Arco arena. Yeah. Nice try. No,
7929880	7935160	we're not calling it that. And then it was sleep train, which ended up getting an amphitheater.
7935160	7939640	Yeah. Which, uh, which was train amphitheater was something else. No, it was both. They had
7939640	7943800	both. That's what made it confusing. They had the amphitheater out in Yuba city, rural area.
7943800	7947560	And then they also had the arena. So you had the sleep amphitheater and the sleep train arena.
7948440	7952040	And then mattress firm bought sleep train, but they never changed the name.
7952680	7957800	It was still the sleep train arena. No, it was Arco arena. Yeah, exactly. No,
7957800	7961880	it was always a forever Arco arena. And they finally bulldozed Arco arena
7961880	7966120	last year because it is now going to be a hospital Arco arena hospital.
7969800	7972200	People are going to have babies born at Arco arena.
7973640	7976600	Are they still going to do like the monster jams in the hospital?
7978920	7982360	It's going to be their big fundraiser event is having that out in the parking lot.
7984920	7989880	No, all the monster jams and shit happened at the golden one center, which is the new and that
7989880	7994360	funny enough, people don't call that Arco arena. No, that's the golden one center
7994360	7999080	because that's downtown. That's just the downtown Plaza.
8000440	8003720	Actually, I do know plenty of people that still call that the downtown Plaza.
8004520	8007800	I still call it downtown Plaza and I'm not even from here.
8007800	8011640	Or is it the K street mall? Like, I don't know what they call it. All of it. All of it is
8011640	8017640	acceptable. And I'm just like the mobile old sack. So a non Sacramento version of the reference that
8017640	8022680	I think more people would understand would be candlestick park. Exact same thing happened
8022680	8028200	with candlestick park. Remember when candlestick park was like monster.com park? I think at some
8028200	8031960	point, do you remember that? I've purged that from my memory.
8031960	8038120	Exactly. Cause nobody fucking ever called candlestick park, anything but candlestick park.
8039720	8044280	They bulldozed candlestick park. Yes. I know you mentioned it. That's why I brought it up.
8044280	8048040	They bulldozed candlestick park like several years ago. Like Paul McCartney was last play
8048040	8051240	there. I heard they were going to put houses or condos there. I don't know if the pandemic
8051240	8055320	slowed that down or what, but they still have it. It is just a bunch of empty land. Do you know
8055320	8058440	what that empty land is called? Candlestick park.
8058440	8059240	Candlestick park.
8063560	8068840	All right. Yes. As you're 100 Matt, you got your sports ball, but it should look,
8068840	8074200	here's the thing. Was the last event at candlestick park sports ball? No, it was not.
8074200	8080120	It was a Paul McCartney concert. Fun fact. Uh, what was the last event at Arco arena?
8080840	8084200	It wasn't sports ball. I think it was also a concert of some sort.
8085240	8092280	Hold on. You know, Arco arena has its own, um, Wiki page and it's under Arco arena. It's not
8092280	8095720	It was really brothers Bardem and Daley. Really?
8095720	8097880	It was, it was, yeah, it was the circus.
8097880	8101080	Of all the things they could have done there. Sleep train arena.
8101960	8108440	Oh, you know what else though? That became the makeshift hospital. They, it had a moratorium on
8108440	8112280	the bulldozing because they made it. Remember when they were really worried about tons of
8112280	8117640	people being hospitalized, that became the overflow hospital. Arco arena was the overflow hospital.
8117640	8123960	So ironically, ironically, yes, Arco arena was a hospital. And from what I understand,
8124680	8130840	one person used the services. One person. But I, you know, I don't give it too much shit because
8130840	8134520	they were preparing for much worse. And I think we need to give that credit, you know, that they
8134520	8140120	were ready to go. Um, but that now that I think about that is ironic. Arco arena kind of foretold
8140120	8144520	its future by becoming a hospital there at the end, didn't it? Right. Anyway.
8144520	8150360	Well, I know that they had, um, a, uh, a goodbye thing like last March.
8150360	8154440	Yeah. That's what it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They had a goodbye event,
8154440	8160520	but the last official event to hire out the arena was, um, the circus.
8161640	8166120	It's kind of disappointing. I don't know why. I think the circus is kind of silly now that I'm
8166120	8168840	in my forties. Maybe if I was a kid, I'd be more excited. But
8170040	8174920	anyway, uh, DJ says, what's the, Oh, nevermind. That's a response to something in chat. Cause
8174920	8178680	I was like, we went over this it's for when it, when it's a hospital, it would be Arco arena
8178680	8187400	hospital. All right. Let's get some calls. They've been waiting patiently for a long time. So I want
8187400	8192520	to get them on the air. Hi, you are on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's the one and
8192520	8197160	only Ron. How's everybody doing? It is so good to hear from you, Rama. And I just want to make sure
8197160	8204040	we're clear. It is always, what, what do we call the new hospital? Go arena. That is exactly right.
8204040	8208280	Good job. We're we're fast learners here at orange lounge radio. Appreciate that.
8209000	8214840	What's on your mind tonight, my friend stuff. But first thing first, I want to thank Loki.
8215560	8220920	He, there's something he did on his YouTube page. That was a big save for me a couple of
8220920	8227480	weeks ago when I was on vacation. What's that? I was, I went down to South Carolina and visits
8227480	8231720	a friend of mine and I'll help her with her kids and all of that. Her kids had a, um,
8232520	8238280	leap over and they were bouncing all over the walls. And I'm like, I got to get them to calm
8238280	8244920	down. And I spoke to my friend's son. Like, what do you like? And he goes by crap. Haha.
8246360	8252520	Well, they'll put our channel 64 out of peep out of them for hours. Nice job. Good. That,
8252520	8258760	that is a true fan right there because you are living the spread the word part of that there.
8258760	8263880	Okay. Nothing to put kids asleep to me rambling for like 15 minutes at a time about things that
8263880	8269720	I'm doing. Okay. So I'm about to derail this entire fucking call right now, but you did call
8269720	8275000	into orange lounge radio. Rama. I just noticed the cup you were sipping out of is a raising
8275000	8279640	Cain's cup. Have they fucking infected New York city? Like the plague as well. Those things have
8279640	8287000	showed up everywhere in the last like two months everywhere. My brother in Christ, they have a
8287000	8291720	global flagship location in times square. Of course they do. Of course. How long has it been?
8291720	8296920	How long has it been there though? A few weeks. And I went by there a few weeks.
8297720	8303880	Let me tell you, I went by there cause I'm like, I went to the healthcare. I went to Zach's bees
8303880	8308840	and then I'm like screaming at friends on Facebook talking about this is not the chicken y'all were
8308840	8314040	telling me about. So y'all need to shut up. So I went to raising Cain's with a friend thinking
8314040	8319800	we'll grab some takeout and then go to the bus. There was a line going outside and around and
8319800	8324200	the place has been open for a few weeks. I'm like, I'm going to go, I'm going to order online,
8324200	8329480	pick up my food, then go home. And that's what I did. And now they're opening another location
8329480	8334920	in, I think around 14th street union, um, near union square later this year too.
8336200	8340840	I've never had it, even though it's ever, I drive by it all the time, all the time. And they,
8340840	8345240	they just bulldozed a fucking Walmart and they're replacing it with Raising Cane's apparently.
8345800	8349080	That's a big Raising Cane's. I know, right? I think something else is going there too,
8349080	8352440	but like Raising Cane's going to be the parking lot or something wild.
8353720	8359160	I think, I don't remember if I saw one in Alabama or I might just be thinking of Zach's bees.
8360600	8363880	Well, anyway, I know you didn't call in to talk about chicken, but you know,
8363880	8367960	uh, more chicken talk. What's on your mind tonight?
8368680	8372120	A couple of things. Um, I want to talk about something that you brought up
8372120	8378840	earlier tonight and something that I mentioned last week. Okay. Now we talked about loot boxes
8378840	8384520	and addiction. Well, I got a story for you. I'm going to change the names on this to protect
8384520	8390040	people. Good idea. I noticed how you said that you did not say the innocent.
8391000	8393960	You just said, well, this person is far from innocent.
8394600	8399480	Aren't we all down? So two friends of mine were going to get married and all that. And the wedding
8399480	8407720	was, was postponed, canceled, whatever that down with my friend, me and Marco, she tells me that
8407720	8416440	her now ex fiance slash roommate got addicted to loot boxes. I'm talking, he would not pay his own
8416440	8422280	bills. He just kept throwing money into loot boxes or in this case, gotcha games, you know,
8422280	8427160	game over. Would you like to contain you $5 for, and that's what he was spending his money on.
8427160	8433160	Oh no. And the addiction got really bad. And my friend's father had sat down,
8433160	8438200	had a talk with him about it. And he said he got better. Evidently he did not.
8441000	8447480	He's I know he's better now, but basically his relationship is gone. Everything he works hard
8447480	8451960	for. It's everything gambling edition. It's everything that you see play into that playing
8451960	8455960	out there. That's that's unfortunate. I'm really sorry to hear about that. I hope, I hope he
8455960	8464440	got the help he needs. I borrows. I know he's in therapy for it, but I do not bring it up because
8464440	8469720	he doesn't know that. I know that's for the best then. Yeah. Now,
8472120	8476440	this is something that came up in a topic last week about the whole
8476440	8483640	Microsoft acquisition and so forth. I had mentioned that while everybody I see on Facebook
8483640	8489400	talking about the whole acquisition, nobody has said anything about the shit Bobby Kotick has done
8489960	8496200	because, and I'm looking at it like, what's really sad is nobody in your friend group has said it,
8496200	8500040	right? Because I'm like, you've listened to this show, right? Okay. Just making sure we're clear
8500040	8505480	on that. Okay. Outside of y'all only like maybe 1% of people are talking about it.
8505560	8509160	Okay. And it's more, the thing is more people is concerned about, they don't want Microsoft
8509160	8514120	taking quality. That's what they're more concerned about as opposed to what's going on with Kotick
8514120	8519880	and the harassment and so forth. Well, at least you underscore why the court case seemed to be
8519880	8524520	all about call of duty. I mean, there, there was a reason for that and you, you kind of underscore
8524520	8530520	that. Right. And the thing is, I'm thinking about if I'd never listened to OLR, I wouldn't know
8531320	8537800	really check the game blogs as I used to. So even if I did, if I read an article about it,
8537800	8542840	probably go through one ear and out the other where y'all y'all bring this up every day,
8542840	8547160	because I think I'm saying things because it is something that needs to be discussed.
8547160	8551960	Like I have a couple of friends who work at Ubisoft and they talk about how great things are
8551960	8560040	for them. And I'm just sitting here going, Hmm, I say something or just mind my business and just go
8560040	8566280	about my day. Respectfully mind your business and go about your day because maybe it is for them,
8566280	8571400	you know, and even though the culture tends to trickle down from the top, because the company
8571400	8577480	is nationwide and split up into smaller studios, it could be that wherever your friends are at in
8577480	8582360	the infrastructure, maybe is a little more insulated from other places. So if there's
8582360	8587720	if they are happy, there's no need to poo poo on the parade. Yeah, it's not
8587720	8593800	that. It's more like, I just want like, whoever is to know what's going on just be informed.
8594520	8599560	Maybe the way I know myself, it's going, I just wouldn't know how. So I'm just like,
8599560	8603880	what about like, hey, I heard like there was a you I don't know if this is actually true. I have to
8603880	8607240	there's a union starting at Ubisoft. Is that something y'all are getting in on, you know,
8607240	8612440	or something that that might be the way to address it instead of like, wow, I heard your CEO is a
8612440	8615800	total shitlord who hasn't been accountable for the last four years. Like what the fuck's going on in
8615800	8621560	that place? That's not going to work, you know, but maybe just kind of hint dropping at some of
8621560	8627080	the ways employees are pushing back might be an interesting way to gauge it. Basically, yeah,
8627080	8632680	for right now, as long as I see it, they're happy. I'm I'm not going to say anything. Yeah,
8632680	8636440	but it's sort of like, it's like, it's like seeing two sides of it. It's like,
8637160	8644040	you know, this is going on. But when you look at people who are discussing it, nobody's talking
8644040	8651560	about like, it's a nonsensical thing, which in actuality, it is not, you know. Yeah. And I think
8651560	8657800	God forbid you depending on what for what group you're in a page, you bring that up. It's like,
8658520	8662520	hello. Well, no one you know, I'm just like, come on. Maybe maybe you should care.
8664280	8668520	Sure as hell do. I know you do. I know you do. Well, Rama, I hate to wrap up,
8668520	8673000	but we got one more call I got to get on. So any last minute thoughts for us tonight before I let
8673000	8682120	you go? Oh, I am running out of space for Funko Pops, because I just bought one. That's my basic
8682120	8687480	one of my TV crushes. So yeah. Okay, you know, I'm like, you're not gonna say that not tell us
8687480	8695160	who the TV crush is. I'll tell y'all. Let me go grab it and well better. So Pena Lawrence from
8695160	8705320	boy. Hold on. I love it. Oh, I shall tell you later. I have a nightcrawler this this big.
8706920	8710520	As long as you didn't say gambit then mako child won't be knocking on your door.
8711240	8715480	It was never a gambit fangirl. It was always my blue fuzzy elf.
8715480	8720120	I don't have any pop vinyls with crushes. But I do have Richard Simmons.
8721080	8728120	Was I something for you, Rob? Oh, I have a mini Richard Simmons bubble bubble head. Yay.
8729640	8736040	But um, talk to me later on Sean. I got some organizers on Etsy and I will link you to them.
8736760	8740440	Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Because all I do now I just haven't been protective.
8741240	8746520	Bad things that just keep them stacked all over my room on my little studio apartment.
8747480	8752040	Shoot what happened? There we go. Okay. Anyway, Rama, I'm gonna let you go so we can get another
8752040	8756600	call. Thank you so much. Take care of my friend. anime jam session. Listen to it or else. All
8756600	8763720	right. Bye. Bye. All right. Let's get another call here on the air. Hi, you are on orange
8763720	8768200	launch radio. Who's this? Hey, this is deaf. Hey, deaf. It's good to hear from you. What's up,
8768200	8776920	my friend? Well, I wanted to talk about a recently released game that last year was
8776920	8785160	released and didn't have that critical price. Which is choco Bo GP. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh,
8785160	8792600	did you Okay, is this about the purchase of the new version of it? Yeah, I actually got the
8792600	8798360	physical version. Though it's a it's an import. I actually have I think it's a
8799880	8804200	yeah, it's a European version. Because in America, you cannot get it physical,
8805160	8810840	a physical version on the digital. The thing the switch is region free. So you can buy
8812120	8819640	the Korean version or the European version, it will work fine perfectly. But yeah, last year,
8819640	8826760	if you remember, it's like, yeah, you can buy the game. But it's filled with microtransactions.
8826760	8834440	It's filled with battle passes. It's, it's like not good. So heavily. It was so heavily into the
8834440	8841080	into putting it more money that it needed to. So it's like, it was really a disappointment. But
8841640	8847160	right now, it's like, okay, it has everything, you can unlock everything with the currency the
8847160	8856440	game gives you. It is a grindy game, I will say it's like not it's not, you cannot get everything
8856440	8866920	like really easily. But the game is fun. It's a really competent card racing game. It has like,
8867640	8874360	it has the not necessarily easter eggs, but it has those references to Final Fantasy as a whole.
8874840	8879160	And obviously previous or other chocobo games like Mystery Dungeon,
8880040	8887640	chocobo racing even and in that. So it actually it is a fun game. It's like I was playing it last
8887640	8894760	night with with some friends. We were playing the chocobo GP mode, which is like a battle royale
8894760	8906280	thing. You have us you enter to a 64 party race, but it's divided in eight between eight players.
8906920	8914280	So if you get to the top four positions or top four places, rather, you keep advancing until
8914280	8920200	you get to the final round. And if you win, you then you win more points, you win more tickets,
8920200	8925080	more money to buy more stuff. So it's it's really addicting to and in that sense,
8926040	8931960	especially with friends, which because it's not that necessarily that the game is not populated
8931960	8938440	online. It actually, I actually surprised that there's many people playing it. But every time
8939240	8945880	my friends and I like were trying to group up, we did group up in the same lobby. So it was funny
8945880	8952520	that we were pretty much hugging the first places. But still, anyways, it's like really
8952520	8959320	fun. My only gripes with the game right now is two things. Again, it's it feels really grindy.
8960200	8966040	But again, the fun, the fun aspect is really compensated. But the other thing is that local
8966040	8973960	multiplayer is only for two players. So you cannot have like Mario Kart or any other racing games out
8973960	8982360	there that you can have up to four even. So yeah, it's that's really limiting. But at the same time,
8982360	8990520	you can go local multiplayer via like local wireless and you can play up to up to eight.
8991480	8996600	So if friends have this, have the game on Switch, it's like, okay, you can play like that. But
8997160	9001400	but I would rather like have one console and have multiple players
9001400	9005560	have a playing from one instead of having multiple consoles.
9005560	9011080	Let me ask you this question because, you know, it's very hard for them to once the game is out,
9011080	9015000	kind of get people to give it a second chance. You know, it takes it takes a while for that
9015000	9017880	information to get out there. We've seen it happen with games, you know, No Man's Sky,
9017880	9024600	Diablo three, etc, etc. List goes on and on. But let's let's make believe this is the game
9024600	9030520	they had released originally. In your opinion, do you think this ends up being a successful game?
9030520	9034680	Or is it still just kind of like me? It's it's it's a meh game. I don't think it ever
9034680	9038760	would have caught on anyway. What happens if this is the game they'd really released originally?
9038760	9044680	I think at least the perspective would have been different, that's for sure.
9045560	9051160	But I wouldn't think it would have been like a success. Like, Oh, my, you have to play this
9051160	9059480	game. No, it would be the same. Because even even a year ago, it's like, okay, you can buy the game
9059480	9067480	in the game. This again is it is fun. But like in comparison to other card racers, it doesn't
9067480	9073880	bring anything new to the game. So it's like that you have your your magic sights, which is like
9073880	9081400	your Mario Kart items, you can combine them like in DBCon racing, you have your drifting you have
9082120	9090360	and the tracks even though they are buried there, they're not like too many, there's only like
9090360	9097400	nine or 10 tracks in total. And each one has one or two variations of it. So it kind of gets
9097400	9107640	repetitive in in a short term. So again, it's it wouldn't been like a huge success, probably
9107640	9112840	a moderate success. Okay. And more people would have been like, Oh, if it's an if it's on sale,
9112840	9119000	get it. Yeah, it's like that kind of thing. I would. Yeah, it's like, even right now it's like
9119000	9125560	it's on sale. So that's that's how I convinced a friend to get it. Hey, it's really cheap right now.
9125560	9131320	You should get it because we can play it and all that stuff. And yeah, he had we had a really
9131320	9137960	good time. And we plan to play it more. So it's like, yeah, it's so awesome that that the game
9138680	9145320	is better now. But it also sucks that it took a year. Yeah, pretty much to get there. Yeah. So
9145320	9151320	yeah, that's a bummer. Well, depth, I appreciate the check back in with that game because I admit
9151320	9155640	that again, the relaunch of it kind of fell off my radar. Although I was super interested in
9155640	9160280	Chocobo GP at first I like you and many other people were just kind of like once we heard
9160280	9165160	how they really were going to micro, you know, monetize the game and stuff. It's like, ah, fuck
9165160	9168760	it. You know, if this if that's what this is, nevermind, we should have never had it come back
9168760	9172920	in the first place. But it's interesting to revisit it now. I'll kind of be curious,
9172920	9176920	especially when it does go on sale in the future inevitably. Maybe I'll end up picking it up for
9176920	9182920	myself. We'll see. Who knows? But again, it's it's in sale right now. Don't know how much longer it
9182920	9189000	is going to be. But it's 50% off. So if you're really interested, you can pick it up right now.
9189000	9196360	All right. Or relatively low price. Even the physical copies aren't that expensive. Mine was
9196360	9204440	around $35. So again, if you're interested in that, you can get it that way. All right.
9204440	9207000	All right. Well, depth, I'm gonna let you go. So we can wrap up the show. But thank you so much
9207000	9212760	for the call. Hey, thanks for having me. All right. Take care, my friend. All right. That
9212760	9218120	was great to hear from depth. Appreciate that. Well, with that, I can smell dinner downstairs.
9218120	9224040	So I'm definitely ready to wrap on up and head on out. So reminder, we're not back next week,
9224040	9227960	we will be back in two weeks. Bobby Black Wolf will be here next week, though. So just
9228760	9232600	because the show ends early enough where he's able to get back and do his show.
9232600	9239160	But I don't have my rig and can't do this show. So but so I'll be gone next week. No,
9240840	9246440	I however, will be playing dead by daylight. All day, daylight by daylight.
9248200	9256920	So yeah, if you want to see cranky Jamie, you have open lobbies most of the time.
9256920	9264280	All right. Um, what's that? I said have a safe flight. Thank you. I'm flying the
9264280	9269080	plane myself this time. So we'll see how it goes. So I'm just kidding. But hopefully,
9269080	9273480	yeah, hopefully all goes well. We'll see you back in two weeks. We'll talk about all the greatest
9273480	9277880	in gaming news at that time. In the meantime, we're gonna wrap up and get on out of here for
9277880	9283400	the night. So of course, we wouldn't be able to do this show if it wasn't for you all. Thank you
9283400	9287000	all for checking out the show. Thank you for spending the time with us. We are the show where
9287000	9291640	every gamer has a voice. But we need more voices to put out here on air. So tell a friend or two
9291640	9296760	about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9296760	9300920	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, or wherever it is you found this show goes an
9300920	9306680	awful long way as well. So super appreciate all of that as well. Final thought time stark sacral.
9306680	9314120	We'll start with you. I can't brain. Um, but, but pineapple and pizza is delicious,
9314120	9320760	but pepperoni pizza is terrible. I like both personally.
9323400	9328520	All right. Have a good stream. Have a good night. All right. Loki will go to you your
9328520	9335480	final thought tonight. I'm going to go to Santa Cruz next week to visit the homeland
9335480	9341240	of my DDR machine. It's allegedly it came from Santa Cruz Beach boardwalk. Allegedly,
9341240	9349320	I don't I can't confirm that. But that's where they said they got it from. So we'll see.
9349320	9353400	Santa Cruz boardwalk was the first place I ever played Mortal Kombat three.
9354200	9357400	It was also the first place I ever played laser tag. So we can go back and play that
9357400	9360920	laser tag to even though it looks like they set up our next week, basically.
9361640	9366840	Yeah, basically we're going on vacation. Good. Enjoy that. That'll be fun. Awesome.
9366840	9370200	All right. Well, uh, for my final thought, of course, I look forward to seeing those of you
9370200	9374680	in the Atlanta area at Southern pride gaming expo. Uh, very excited about it. Uh, don't be shy,
9374680	9380280	come up and say hi. My understanding is this is a much smaller expo than, um, dragon con. Of course,
9380280	9384520	uh, I believe it would be more in line with the crowds I see at California extremes. So, um,
9384520	9390200	please, if you're there, come say hi. Don't be shy. I'm a normal person. I promise. Um, happy,
9390200	9393880	happy to sit down and play a game. As long as it's one, I like, don't ask me to play
9393880	9397400	literally anything. It's gotta be something I somewhat like, don't ask me to play Madden.
9397400	9402760	I'm not going to do that, but blaze of steel. I might, I might, but I look forward to seeing
9402760	9406120	everybody there. And of course, we're going to have that panel with the Nintendo voice actors
9406120	9411480	Sunday at one o'clock. And I am jazzed to talk all about that on next week or next week's orange
9411480	9417160	lounge radio. If not a little sooner, uh, that's it. Have a great week, two weeks. Everybody will
9417160	9422280	be back then to talk more about gaming. Have fun, stay safe, stay out of the heat. And if
