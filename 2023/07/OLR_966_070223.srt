00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
The Switch successor conversation has been steadily growing and it was reported that

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,840
Nintendo's CEO stated during a shareholders meeting that,

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,900
In the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next generation console, we would like

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,580
to make every effort to ensure the customers can make the transition smoothly while using

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,580
their Nintendo account.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,580
What does that mean?

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,520
That Nintendo is making a new console!

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,640
And nothing else set in stone.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
This is the news to no one headline, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,600
Summers and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
news.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,360
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,500
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,420
every gamer has a voice.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:54,400
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 966 of our

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,600
show for tonight, July the 2nd of 2023.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,080
I know it's a long weekend for some folks, but we're still here anyway.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm here, Rob Roberts, with you every week with my co-hosts.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,040
Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Hi.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Hello, hello.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,600
How are you doing?

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,640
We live in the devil's parched dry chapped asshole.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
We don't live in Phoenix.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,480
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
No.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,200
That one is the cursed parched dry asshole.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,360
Oh, I see.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
I see.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,400
Thank you for the clarification.

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,760
Right now it's 101, so it's better than it was earlier, but we hit 108 again today.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,960
Thankfully, it's going to be in the 80s, I think by the 4th, but if you live in a place

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,840
with vaulted ceilings, blink, blink, it does not stay cool.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,880
Vaulted ceilings are not your friend.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,720
I was enjoying our nice, mild June because it actually, this is the first year I can

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,520
think of in a long time where it has not hit 100 degrees in all of June in our lovely Sacramento,

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
California where we're all at.

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,040
I was like, oh, this is the site of climate change I can deal with.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,880
If that means we're going to have moderate summers, okay.

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,720
It sucks about the floods, but you know, okay, at least we, and then nope, nope, here we

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,720
are right back to the, you know, Satan's taint or whatever you refer to it as is very much

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,960
in progress for sure.

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,200
Well, people were calling it like the, you know, damp asshole or like, no, no, no, that's

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Alabama.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,080
It's not damp here.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,720
It's not damp.

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,400
And yeah, Mike, I understand it's harder where you are, but I mean, going from it having

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:59,480
been no hotter than like 85 to an immediate triple digit is a bit of a fast change and

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,200
I am not looking forward to my power bill.

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,840
I, it, you can't, it's, I cannot sleep when I'm hot and I also have this thing where I

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,360
have to have 50 bajillion blankets on me to be able to sleep kind of like having a weighted

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,680
blanket, but not quite.

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,800
It's been a very interesting, I'm, I'm, I, I needed help sleeping.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Thank you.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
You cancel it.

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,120
You can't set your ingredients.

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,880
You can't sleep when you're hot.

58
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,400
No, but you're hot all the time.

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh girl.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Well, I know that, but I mean, temperature wise, I actually, okay.

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,600
You know, you know how, how ice cream makes me really sick now.

62
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,840
I didn't care.

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,320
I ate an entire chocolate shake.

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,880
That was actually, that was me this week eating KFC because I realized the Diablo four promotion

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
ended today.

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,080
And I was like, Oh, I should probably go eat some KFC.

67
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,240
And then I remembered, Oh, there's a reason I don't eat KFC.

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,560
And that would be terrible.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,720
The food is the reason I don't eat at KFC anyway.

70
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,580
I liked their fries for a long time, but you know, why could, I mean, I understand why

71
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,320
in your case, but in general, why go to KFC?

72
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,640
If you have a jolly bee near you.

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
Or even, even Popeyes.

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
I'll take Popeyes.

75
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
No, no, no.

76
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Why?

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Why go to Popeyes when you have a jolly?

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Cause I don't have a jolly bean.

79
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Yes, you do.

80
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Rob.

81
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,080
It's all the way down near you.

82
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Well now.

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Oh no.

84
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,160
The new thing is, um, raising canes is everywhere, right?

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Even that jolly bee.

86
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
All right.

87
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
All right.

88
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
It's all about the chicken.

89
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Joy.

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
All right.

91
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,600
Look, I need a, I need a outside fast food opinion on this and who better to bring in

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,360
then tech master Loki.

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Hello.

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Hi.

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Where should I get chicken?

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Uh, bonds.

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Oh, of course.

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
You'd say that.

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Of course you'd say that's, that's expensive.

100
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
That's designed.

101
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
It's a Korean chicken place.

102
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Oh, I mean, that's different.

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,280
Korean fried chicken is completely different.

104
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm just talking about like, that's the KFC I want.

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
They have the cracked chicken, which I don't know what they put on it.

106
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
It's probably cracked because it's white and powdery.

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,200
So, you know, but it's, uh, some sort of like dust that they put on it that's sugary.

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
And I think it's like sugary or parmesani or something.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know what it is.

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They won't say what it is.

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
It's cracked, but like, it's good.

112
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Okay.

113
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:25,760
Um, I have one place that will last, last message, message that mention of it in Oakland

114
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,560
on Telegraph near the, the, the original, uh, KP market, there's a place called OB town.

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,100
It looks like a little former fast food restaurant hole in the wall.

116
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,520
They have the best true KFC.

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Okay.

118
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
End of story.

119
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,800
Well, uh, another vote for a fried chicken in our chat, uh, from DJ Rama S because we

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,840
do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific at the voice geeks

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,400
network twitch.tv slash a VOG network right after the Bobby black Wolf show, uh, except

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
not tonight.

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,040
Bobby black Wolf is enjoying the long holiday weekend, but Bobby will be back next week.

124
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,200
And I will be with Bobby black Wolf in Atlanta, Georgia at the end of July for the Southern

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,540
fried speaking of chicken, Southern fried gaming expo, which is happening at the end

126
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
of July.

127
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,660
Uh, so stay tuned for that.

128
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,460
Uh, but I want to get to do Jerome S who says, cause I do agree with this.

129
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,220
Do Jerome S says, uh, forget Raising Cane's hit up a local Halal fried chicken restaurant,

130
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,900
cheaper and better tasting true.

131
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,340
Some of the best fried chicken.

132
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,340
Okay.

133
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:36,660
However, that place in Rancho Cordova by the target, uh, is not there anymore.

134
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,700
I know I ate there.

135
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,400
And I was like, that is that, that was as good as the fried chicken at Disneyland.

136
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
It really was.

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I ate those.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Like that was amazing.

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,520
Four weeks later gone.

140
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,560
And I was like, of course, because I liked it.

141
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,740
That's what happens to things I like.

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,900
I don't get to keep them.

143
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Yeah.

144
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,060
I'd gone there before because they had chicken and waffles, but they were okay.

145
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
They weren't great.

146
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,060
I love them.

147
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,180
I mean, I'm even going to say that I like as much as I love Roscoe's.

148
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:09,740
I'm even going to say, okay, Roscoe's is kind of up at the top for me because as, as a Southern

149
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,980
girl, I know my fried chicken and I know my soul food.

150
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,840
It's it's chicken.

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:27,420
The chicken from Roscoe's with a big plate of grits is heaven followed only by fried

152
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
chicken liver.

153
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
If someone will eat it with me.

154
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Okay.

155
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Last thought.

156
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,580
I love Roscoe's, but since you brought up Roscoe's, it makes me laugh because did you

157
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,420
know in the gayborhood, they opened the old spot that used to be hot rods.

158
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,900
And it's now like a brunch bar called Roscoe's, but it has nothing to do, no, it has nothing

159
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
to do with it.

160
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
It's for drag brunch.

161
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
That's what it is.

162
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
So it cracked me up.

163
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,860
Cause I'm like, now when you say Roscoe's people think of that place, so can we, can

164
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
we go to drag brunch?

165
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Of course.

166
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
There's like 50 of them here.

167
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
Yeah, of course.

168
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,860
I probably know a performer at every one of them somehow.

169
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,580
It's a small town sometimes.

170
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,180
So well, yeah, but I haven't been to drag brunch in like age, age, age, ages.

171
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
You want to do drag brunch?

172
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,420
You want to do drag dinner?

173
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
You want to do?

174
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,740
I want to do all the drags.

175
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,860
Sunday best of the week.

176
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,700
We could do a drag tee.

177
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
We can do that.

178
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
You name it.

179
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,660
Do we get, do we get to spill it?

180
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Yes.

181
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
All right.

182
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
We spilled tea at the drag tee.

183
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,140
Well, we're going to spill some tea right here at the top of the show because this is

184
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,380
a company that I talk a lot about on the show and unfortunately they hit some pretty bad

185
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,900
news this week, but I think some of us might've seen this coming a little bit.

186
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,420
This is a tricky, tricky topic cause I know people and I indirectly know people that were

187
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,460
affected by this.

188
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,260
So this kind of sucks.

189
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,180
But I have some things to say about it.

190
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,480
Loki, did you want to start us off with the headline and what's going on here?

191
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
What I'm referring to?

192
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,400
So Niantic is shutting down their Los Angeles studio and they're moving away from in-house

193
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,960
game development.

194
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,360
The Pokemon Go studio, they're laying off 230 employees.

195
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
NBA All World is being shut down.

196
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Oh my God.

197
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,880
It wasn't popular.

198
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
That's surprising.

199
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,520
And they're also canceling the upcoming Marvel World of Heroes game that they were going

200
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,240
to be putting out as well, which I mean, honestly, they have way too many games going at one

201
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
time.

202
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,040
They said, I guess, in internal email to the employees, they said that the expenses grew

203
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,040
faster than revenue.

204
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
And I mean, that makes sense.

205
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,520
We also bear the responsibility for our performance.

206
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:49,240
Today's highly competitive mobile gaming market requires dazzling quality and innovation.

207
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,560
It's also requires strong monetization and a social core, which can drive viral growth

208
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,120
and long term engagement.

209
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,560
Teams need to need platform tools that force multipliers, enabling them to build at the

210
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,560
highest quality with powerful engagement features quickly and efficiently.

211
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,760
Our AR map and platform must deliver the features that developers want in a robust, reliable

212
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
way.

213
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,720
We have not met the goals in any of these areas.

214
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,640
I just think you had poor monetization for some of that stuff.

215
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
I don't know.

216
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,840
You're kind of a little too greedy in some areas.

217
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,800
And yeah, lack of innovation.

218
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,520
You keep putting out games that aside from giving a new paint job, they weren't really

219
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
worthwhile to play.

220
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
It wasn't like Pokemon Go.

221
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,720
They're trying to get that success, but it just wasn't happening.

222
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,320
So I have a few things to say on this because, you know, I've been following Niantic a long

223
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
time, right?

224
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,840
I was in the beta for Pokemon Go because I'd played their other game, Ingress, for quite

225
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
a long time.

226
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,620
In fact, one of my favorite episodes we ever did of this show was back when we were all

227
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,620
in person.

228
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,360
You might remember at Studio N7, we actually brought some of the ladies that I played Ingress

229
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
with in for a show.

230
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,960
I want to say it was in January of one year.

231
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
We all were in studio.

232
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,400
That was a really fun show because they love that game.

233
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,160
The sad thing is, though, I think only one of them that was here still plays regularly.

234
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,880
The other ones have kind of, you know, gone off into retirement, but that game has been

235
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,640
around for like, you know, that game is celebrated 10 years, actually, this last year.

236
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,600
So yeah, I've been following this company for a long time.

237
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,740
So I have some thoughts on this for sure.

238
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,960
So here's the thing.

239
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,920
Why is Niantic struggling as a gaming company?

240
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,260
And I would like to share with you my thoughts on the answer to this Niantic is struggling

241
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,500
as a gaming company because Niantic is not a gaming company.

242
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,660
And in this TED Talk, I will explain to you the reasons why I believe Niantic has unfortunately

243
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,480
allowed the scope to grow too big from what they really wanted to do and allowed this

244
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,980
situation to happen in the first place.

245
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Let's start.

246
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm not joking, bitch, by the way.

247
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,400
Let's start by going to Niantic's website.

248
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,540
Let's take a look and talk.

249
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,840
Let's see what Niantic has to say about the games that they're making.

250
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,900
Of course, we have an ad for Peridot, their newest game, right?

251
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:28,740
And then we get down and you expect on a mobile game developer's website, you're going to

252
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,800
see something about their statement about making fun games or making accessible games

253
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,520
or making games you want to play, games as a part of our life.

254
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,200
Well, look, here it is.

255
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,300
Here's the Niantic mission statement right here at the bottom of NianticLabs.com.

256
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,680
What if augmented reality could make us better?

257
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Could it nudge us off the couch for a Saturday in the park?

258
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,080
Could it draw us into public space and into contact with neighbors we might never have

259
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,260
met?

260
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,660
We believe it can.

261
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,160
Join us.

262
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,960
Now, I didn't see anything in that statement that actually related to games.

263
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,160
I saw things in that statement that related to other cool things.

264
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
And here's the thing.

265
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,280
I would not support Niantic as long as I have if I did not think they had some good ideas.

266
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,880
And all that stuff in there is cool stuff like, yeah, it's fun to go outside and play,

267
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,840
mix up fitness with gaming.

268
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,080
A lot of that stuff is crucial to me.

269
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,040
So I'm not necessarily razzing Niantic for that statement, but I am pointing out Niantic

270
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,600
did not start out to be a game company.

271
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Continuing on, let's consider who is at the top of Niantic right now.

272
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
John Hankey, right?

273
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,280
Now, look, here's the thing about John Hankey.

274
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,480
I actually think he's a pretty intelligent guy and he's done a lot of stuff.

275
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,680
Disclaimer, I once met the guy and I did a Pokemon raid with him, but it was a chance

276
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,440
meeting and so forth with this whole thing.

277
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,120
But what is John Hankey's gaming background?

278
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,760
What are the games that he developed before running Niantic quickly?

279
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,520
You probably don't know.

280
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,320
That's because he made one.

281
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
He helped with one.

282
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,320
It was a game called Meridian 59.

283
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,080
That was for the 3DO company.

284
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,200
Yeah, but Meridian 59, well, it is still around today, actually.

285
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,080
So for all intents and purposes, I can't sit here and say, oh, Meridian 59 was a flop.

286
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,440
It was one of the first graphically multiplayer games, long, long running.

287
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,280
It may actually not be around anymore, but the game did have impact.

288
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,240
He was not the only person behind the game, but it did have impact.

289
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,080
That's not what he's known for.

290
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,760
John Hankey is known for Google Earth, Google Maps, Street View, and then some other things,

291
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,600
you know, Panoramio, which is where people are taking the panoramas within Google Maps

292
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
and all that stuff.

293
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,800
Now, I love Street View.

294
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,280
I love Google Maps.

295
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,760
And I think that was innovative.

296
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,480
That was like, that was big stuff, you know?

297
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,360
So again, the guy's got the resume.

298
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,480
But when it comes to gaming, it hasn't really worked on a lot, a lot of games.

299
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,360
So where did Niantic come from in the first place?

300
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,800
I mentioned that Ingress was the first game that they did, but you might forget that before

301
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,380
Ingress, they actually did an app called Field Trip.

302
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,540
Field Trip wasn't a game.

303
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,200
Field Trip was a location-based mobile app, which was your guide to cool, hidden, and

304
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,320
unique things in the world around you.

305
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:48,560
Ingress set out to gamify that because Ingress, as it was, or excuse me, Niantic as it was,

306
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:57,920
was set up not to become a gaming company, Niantic was set up to take this Google Map

307
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,560
stuff one step further and go back to their mission statement, be a part of augmented

308
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,360
reality and making the world around you better.

309
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,280
Field Trip was the first attempt to map all that stuff out.

310
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,560
Ingress then gamified it to make people want to do it more because Field Trip didn't end

311
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,320
up lasting long.

312
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,920
And then what happened after that?

313
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,160
Ingress got actually a lot bigger in Japan than it even is here, and it caught the attention

314
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,880
of some key people at Nintendo.

315
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,760
And it became, remember, Google Maps, going back to something John Hanke is familiar with,

316
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,320
when Niantic was still with Google, because remember Niantic was actually a Google company

317
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
at first, right?

318
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,760
Sorry, I know you could have a whole graph going with this thing, but bear with me here.

319
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:51,920
So Niantic makes Pokemon Go as a result of the success of Ingress, the ideas that were

320
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,000
there, the Google Maps thing kind of leading to a tihi, wouldn't this be a cute idea?

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,040
And sure enough, they did launch this cute idea.

322
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,520
And then what happens after that?

323
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,240
Get too big for their britches.

324
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Pokemon Go gets way bigger than anyone could have ever expected.

325
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,720
Even to Niantic's comments, even to anybody else out there, Pokemon Go got way bigger

326
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,440
than anyone anticipated.

327
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,440
As Mike Deft puts it in chat, remember when we reached world peace seven years ago?

328
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,280
Yes, summer of 2016, it's all been downhill from there in history.

329
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:45,240
The summer of Pokemon Go was the climax of human civilization.

330
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,920
And then it's been a slow decline from there, the pandemic and Trump and so on and so on

331
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,360
from there.

332
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,500
So Pokemon Go gets really, really big.

333
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,660
And then, of course, what happens from there?

334
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,840
Now it's, oh, my God, we've got lightning in a bottle.

335
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,980
We've got to replicate this lightning in a bottle.

336
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,900
Now we've got Pikmin.

337
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,100
Now we've got Harry Potter.

338
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:21,880
Now we've got Marvel, Catan, Marvel, all these games trying to replicate the success of something

339
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,780
that I argue can probably no longer be replicated because the world has changed.

340
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,220
And that's how we got into the situation that we're in today with Niantic is that they were

341
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:41,880
forced, essentially, beyond what they were setting out to do, to be a gaming company.

342
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,980
They were under that immense amount of pressure from everybody, investors and so forth, to

343
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,820
replicate the success of Pokemon Go.

344
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,940
But that's not what Niantic ever had set out to do.

345
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,540
Niantic wanted to get into this augmented reality thing.

346
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,460
And I mean, if you really think about it, going back to Google Maps leading to Street

347
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,740
View, what's one step beyond Street View?

348
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,360
Getting to all the places the cars can't go, looking at where people go when they walk

349
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,820
and mapping when they walk and the cool things they interact with when they walk, which is

350
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:25,500
literally the gameplay loop in Pikmin Bloom, which was spared from the axe, by the way,

351
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
if you noticed.

352
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm sure you're really happy about that.

353
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,180
I am because actually, and I do, and I've been very open about this.

354
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,980
I credit Pikmin Bloom coming at the right time with motivating me to lose the weight.

355
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,340
So that's why even though, yes, I'm being a little bit critical of how we ended up in

356
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,300
this situation, I actually do root for Niantic.

357
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
I want them to succeed.

358
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,260
I want to see them be successful.

359
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:58,540
But the problem is they have literally hinged their entire lifeline on that mission statement

360
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,540
that I read to you earlier from their website.

361
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,340
One more thing I want to add to this, Loki already touched on it, but I want to bold

362
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,500
it and underline it.

363
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,040
Why did this happen?

364
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,660
There are internal, I'm reading from the organizational update that Loki cited earlier.

365
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,220
There are internal and external factors.

366
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,900
We're in a tough market environment due to the overall global macroeconomics slowdown.

367
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,020
We'll never achieve 2016 again.

368
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,500
Unique challenges in the mobile gaming and AR markets.

369
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,540
I think that's kind of fluff, but sure.

370
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,740
In the years since Pokémon GO's launch, the mobile market has become crowded, imitators,

371
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,540
knockoffs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

372
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,020
We also face an AR market that's developing more slowly than anticipated because the technology

373
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,900
changes and because larger players are slowing down their investments in light of the macro

374
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
environment.

375
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,020
I think that's trying to say that people were going outside less during the pandemic.

376
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,660
I think.

377
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,300
We also bear responsibility for our own performance.

378
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,960
Today's highly competitive mobile gaming market requires dazzling quality and innovation.

379
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,100
It also requires strong monetization and a social core, which can drive viral growth

380
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,260
and long-term engagement.

381
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,580
Games need platform tools that are force multipliers, enabling them to build at the

382
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:23,060
highest quality with powerful engagement features quickly and efficiently.

383
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,700
Bold this, underline this, italicize this.

384
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,460
Our AR map and platform must deliver the features that developers want in a robust and reliable

385
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,200
way.

386
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,360
Isn't that interesting that that ultimately ends up being the emphasis?

387
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,260
Not.

388
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,040
We need to make better games.

389
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:53,420
The game loop is the re- you know, the, the, the, um, the monetization needs to be fun

390
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,940
and the game needs to be, uh, you know, things that people want to play and it's a competitive

391
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
environment.

392
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,520
Yes, that, that is what went wrong, but that is not what they illustrate as what they need

393
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,820
to do moving forward.

394
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,300
And to be fair, NBA world, all world got the ax.

395
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,080
Why did that game get the ax?

396
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
It sucked.

397
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,920
Like, and I, again, I know people in Antigon, I'm sorry to be a bitch, but the reality is

399
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,540
like, again, either, either invest in that statement that you've got or don't.

400
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:31,380
And when you walk to your neighborhood park to play a mediocre single player cell phone

401
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:38,100
basketball game for an arbitrary control of a basketball stadium that fits in with

402
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,860
neither a fun game or your earlier mission statement.

403
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,440
And there's the other extreme.

404
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,340
And of course it's the pink elephant in the room, Niantic disabling remote, excuse me,

405
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:58,020
not doubling remote raid passes, limiting them to five a day, consistently basically

406
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,160
telling the Pokemon go fans, no, we're going to do what's best for the game.

407
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,260
And do you know what are the most interesting comments I saw to that whole situation when

408
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:15,120
Niantic literally and continues to in a defiant Reddit CEO kind of way continues to dig their

409
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,160
heels in about nope, we're going back to the mission statement is that the comment I saw

410
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,220
was I have never seen a company so beholden to their mission statement that they are willing

411
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,980
to leave money on the table for it.

412
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,140
Well then also on top of that, like as you mentioned a them walking back all the changes,

413
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,680
one of the other things that they just did recently is they walked back the distance

414
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,980
which you can capture Pokemon from 80 meters to 40 saying that it was an unintended effect

415
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
and a bug.

416
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,400
You know, this this great feature that you know, could be seen as, hey, you know what,

417
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,200
we understand that there's people with mobility problems, and we want you to have fun.

418
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,040
More like, oh, I'm sorry, we can't make as much money off you because you know, we want

419
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,860
you to buy those incense and stuff.

420
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,220
So well, now we're going to just drop it back down to see if that will get you to pay us

421
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,920
more money for it.

422
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Yeah.

423
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,320
Now, here's here's the thing and you'd probably like me to get to the fucking point already

424
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,560
because I've been talking about this for a while but I wanted to set the stage for this

425
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:22,200
and you know what, make make it very clear to you Niantic is torn between the AR thing

426
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,680
and making the games that are fun and have the whole like, gameplay loop and all of that.

427
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,920
Okay.

428
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Here's the thing.

429
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,480
And yeah, yeah, Rob, it's easy to run a video game company.

430
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,160
Why don't you try running one look, we've been following this industry for 21 years,

431
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm just going to offer my humble opinion.

432
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,800
And I'm trying not to do it in a YouTube or podcast sensationalist way.

433
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,200
I'm trying to do it in a realistic way.

434
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,320
And my suggestion would be, you need to take the cue from epic games, you need to take

435
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,480
the cue from some of these other Unity and Unreal.

436
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,480
And here's what you need to do Niantic, you need to separate.

437
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,660
And you need to do both.

438
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,600
You need one company to handle the games.

439
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,400
You need one company to handle lightship and AR and Wayfarer and that type of network.

440
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,800
You need to split just as you split off of Google to achieve your vision.

441
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,400
Because as you see, it is too difficult for one company and one CEO to do both.

442
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,160
So in my opinion, that's what Niantic needs to do is they need to split meaning there

443
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,500
needs to be a new CEO, a new top person in charge of the game with some game development

444
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,720
background and experience, who hopefully can dig them out of you know, some of these holes

445
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,560
and listen to because there's very clearly a conflict and you see this bolded underlined

446
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,600
highlighted with what's happening with the Pokemon go and the consistent rollback of

447
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,280
the changes.

448
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,460
Every change they're rolling back in Pokemon go is in support of the other half of Niantic.

449
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,320
And what Niantic believes is the future the AR dev lightship and taking Google street

450
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,360
maps one step further.

451
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,720
That's it.

452
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,440
So Niantic can either go all in on that and Pokemon go will probably last a little while

453
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,800
longer, but the steam is starting to run out.

454
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:25,440
I have not opened poke Well, I opened it but like I have not played Pokemon go in a while.

455
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,800
I think I uninstalled it a lot of people a long time ago.

456
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,160
So I mean, it's first of all, I also think it's very boring.

457
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,220
There's like, it's just repetitive over and over.

458
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,540
But on top of that, I mean, with the way that they've been behaving, I haven't really had

459
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,660
any desire to play any Niantic game.

460
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:54,900
It's just I don't want to be and the thing is, is that they don't listen to their player

461
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,020
base and do the things that are going to keep people engaged and keep, you know, I mean,

462
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,380
there are people who like Yeah, I want my shinies.

463
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
I want to do this.

464
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,940
I like doing this one aspect of it or there's, you know, I'm not gonna

465
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,540
say that there's not anything for anybody in the game.

466
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:21,020
But from my perspective, me as a player, I, there was nothing to maintain engagement.

467
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,280
Let's go to chat for some comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network as 100 Matt says

468
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,940
Niantic is not a game company.

469
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,220
And if someone goes to buy Niantic, they're not buying them for games.

470
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:36,100
It will be for their AR geolocation tech will someone almost bought them for their games.

471
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,940
I know we all saw that floating around the news.

472
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,540
I know we have something coming up later in the show about, you know, Microsoft's potential

473
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,540
acquisitions, but I don't think I'm spoiling things too much by saying Niantic in fact

474
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,960
was on that radar, which kind of made me giggle because when the whole Pokemon go thing happened,

475
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,420
I kind of joked and I said, Niantic needs to be bought out, although they're not going

476
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,980
to be I had no idea Microsoft was actually exploring that opportunity, but ultimately

477
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,920
decided to go a different direction with the Activision Blizzard decision.

478
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,560
Let's see, Mike Deft in chat says, but yeah, it's baffling how Niantic is willing to be

479
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,800
so fucking stubborn while the community wants them to change or at least adapt to the current

480
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:24,000
world because Mike Deft it's in conflict with mapping the world and getting the AR data

481
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,520
and getting the 3d scans of pokey stops because I'll tell you what, in Ingress, they finally

482
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,560
incorporated this whole thing where the scanning of the locations you can now hack cubes in

483
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,900
3d and this whole thing to get more gear.

484
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,740
It's kind of messy in the way it works, but I guarantee they're trying to do something

485
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,860
similar with Pokemon go and it will come in the next couple years where all those portal

486
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,140
scans that sort of thing.

487
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,100
They're going to try to get you out to those places to do, you know, an interact with the

488
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,300
Pokemon for whatever kind of reward.

489
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,160
I don't know what what they're going to dream up, but we'll see.

490
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,860
Every step backwards that Niantic has taken and Pokemon go, they see it as a step forward

491
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,520
for getting people back out there to collect the AR data.

492
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,540
What they are not remembering is that people are not going to be motivated to go out and

493
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:18,580
get the AR data if everybody else decided to say, screw it.

494
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,980
And especially on a day like today where it's one hundred and eight degrees outside, you

495
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
know what?

496
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Screw it.

497
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
Did it?

498
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Did it?

499
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Let's see.

500
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,620
I think there was one other comment I wanted to read here.

501
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,460
S.H.O. 100 Matt says, and invest in a fucking PR and community management team.

502
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:46,420
Here's the sad part, Matt, who do you think lost their jobs?

503
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,420
But I'm going to guess those people all suck.

504
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:59,740
In fact, I don't know how much I should say I'm very confident those individuals know

505
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,620
damn well what everyone on the Internet is saying.

506
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,220
Do you think maybe, as tends to happen in the gaming industry, there was someone up

507
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,460
above them telling them, no, this is the message you need to run with the message?

508
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
And what's the message?

509
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,740
Get out there and go raid with your friends and make make friends from strangers and play

510
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,060
in nature, because that is our mission statement.

511
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,980
So it's not that they need a PR and community management team.

512
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
They had one.

513
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,420
They need it back.

514
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:49,220
They need management, a mission statement, a corporate culture that supports that before

515
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,300
anything else.

516
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:57,220
And the only way that's going to happen at this point, as I said, is Niantic to split.

517
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,820
Or hanky leaves and someone else comes in.

518
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,820
But I don't see that happening.

519
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,180
And again, it feels weird to me because I don't necessarily dislike John Hankey.

520
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,580
I think he's very intelligent.

521
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,060
I think he's contributed a lot to this.

522
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:18,340
I think in this particular circumstance, he is running a company he doesn't want to run.

523
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,020
And that's my final answer.

524
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,300
All right.

525
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,380
There's no other comments on that.

526
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,020
Thank you all for indulging my TED talk.

527
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,660
But you knew on this one, you knew on this one, I'd have something to say.

528
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,660
All right.

529
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,140
But let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things you want to say.

530
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,620
So let's get into our gaming weeks.

531
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,820
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

532
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,500
It was all right.

533
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,580
I, of course, played Dead by Daylight.

534
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,300
I actually played some Killer by myself offline.

535
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:56,420
And I'd been playing with Fixie and Shayla offline for the anniversary stuff earlier.

536
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,580
And I'm liking the anniversary stuff, but matches have been weird because it's been

537
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:08,580
either completely fun farming people and assholes.

538
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,140
There's no in between.

539
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,660
The sweat has been dripping off of killers and it is rancid.

540
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,140
And then some smell like sweet petunias.

541
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:29,140
But of course, I'm not super happy with all the cosmetics, but I'm a whore for the cosmetics.

542
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,940
And then I have been, of course, on my wordscapes, talk about repetitive, but at least it's something

543
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,980
that stimulates my brain.

544
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:43,820
Also Midnight Suns, I'm getting a little bit, I mean, I love playing the game that's sort

545
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,780
of like my mindless fun, but I don't know, maybe it's time to go back to the retro games.

546
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,780
I haven't decided.

547
00:32:51,780 --> 00:33:03,460
And of course, Cult of the Lamb, I'm thinking about going back and playing into some of

548
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,660
my backlog.

549
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:13,020
And I actually also did download Unity for reasons.

550
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:18,820
So we'll see what comes of that.

551
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:23,540
But mostly it's just been my usual ones.

552
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:30,180
Oh, we should be getting, I think we should be getting Reared Owl this month or next month.

553
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Something like that.

554
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Yeah.

555
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:38,500
And I played something else and my brain is like, you can't think of anything else that

556
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,860
you've ever played in your life.

557
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,740
So I'm just going to leave it at that.

558
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Oh, yeah.

559
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Dig Dug.

560
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Fun.

561
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
Yeah.

562
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
All right.

563
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm going to go to you, Loki.

564
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,500
But first, a lot of folks in chat have been taken by the game playing in your background

565
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,540
tonight, which I believe I read about this somewhere on the internet, but it's like a

566
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,940
newer version of ET.

567
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,660
So you have video that runs behind you as we're taping live on Twitch.

568
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,420
And this definitely looks like a sequel to ET.

569
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,460
Tell us a little bit about this game you've got running behind you.

570
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,900
I saw this in a tweet from Scott Rubin.

571
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,220
You know, love Scott.

572
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,740
It is an itch.io game called, but that's, you know, it's easy to understand.

573
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,340
Yeah, it's called ET Returns.

574
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,020
It's basically ET in the style of Vampire Survivor.

575
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,140
So it's a shooter game that you have to survive hordes of enemies coming.

576
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,660
They're all Atari 2600 enemies.

577
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,960
So if, you know, we've got lots of different things in there, but yeah, it's free.

578
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
You can check it out.

579
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,960
I'll post the link here in chat.

580
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,360
And yeah, it's pretty fun.

581
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,800
So aside from that, I played, was it Proto Corgi this week, so I actually did play some

582
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
things.

583
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
That game is awesome.

584
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,840
It really is.

585
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,160
It's like under eight dollars right now on the Steam, and it's such a really good like

586
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,700
classic side scrolling, shoot them up type of game.

587
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,200
And it has a Corgi and it barks and it's super cute.

588
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,040
It's done in like an anime style, like with the intro and everything.

589
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,720
Highly, highly recommend you go check it out, especially in the Steam store.

590
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,200
Yes, exactly.

591
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,080
And it's just it's such a good game.

592
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
It really is.

593
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,600
The music, everything about the game is fantastic.

594
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,800
And it's like under it's well under ten dollars right now.

595
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,960
So like absolutely go pick it up.

596
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,320
Aside from that, just Minecraft stuff.

597
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,720
So working on my build right now, I'm almost I have it all designed.

598
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,600
I'm actually building it and hoping to have an episode out this week.

599
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,960
We figured out when our next season starting.

600
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,240
So that's cool.

601
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
And then.

602
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:53,320
I don't know, I got very busy, thanks, like, you know, forever, but I'm very, very busy

603
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,120
specifically in the next two months.

604
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
So yeah.

605
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
All right.

606
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
That's it.

607
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Oh, oh.

608
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
And I almost forgot.

609
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,520
I also bought a a build your own pinball kit.

610
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,480
And it's like a little tabletop pinball game.

611
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Yeah, that's pretty fun.

612
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,440
It's all out of wood and stuff.

613
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,080
There's a there's a guy who sells a couple of different things like that at some of the

614
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,640
big expos, and I've been curious about the wooden one.

615
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Let me know if it's fun.

616
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,480
Yeah, I'll have to see it.

617
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,760
You know, as far as assembly goes, it's all like, you know, you put push everything together.

618
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,360
I did kind of break one of the tiny little like pegs that you have to put into like adhere

619
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
something to it.

620
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,480
It's going to be like some hot glue being used, but you're supposed to be able to put

621
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,120
it together without having to use hot glue.

622
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,800
And it comes with like all the tools and everything for you.

623
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
It.

624
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,400
Yeah, not exactly the theme I would want.

625
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,000
It's like circus themed and they have like circus music that plays over it.

626
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,660
And so thankfully you can turn it off.

627
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,660
But yeah, it has all the electronics and everything for it as well.

628
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,960
So I'm very curious to see how it ends up playing.

629
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Cool.

630
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,120
All right.

631
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Let's see.

632
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,400
Let's go into a chat room over at Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network.

633
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,560
Tiger class says he posted that first and then Scott posted it and credited him.

634
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Oh, sorry.

635
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
I didn't see it.

636
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,800
I mean, what?

637
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,760
I didn't see a tweet on Twitter.

638
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,240
I wonder why that is.

639
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,680
It's not because that's a big dumpster fire and even more of a dumpster fire now with

640
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,760
our, you know, rations of tweets per day.

641
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Thanks.

642
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
I know.

643
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,200
The advertiser supported what is that guy doing?

644
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,240
He has no business.

645
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,840
But when you have all that kind of money, like, but at this point, anyone willing to

646
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,440
travel to Mars for that man is a fool.

647
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,620
But I just like, I just like, well, like, yeah, yeah, like it's weird.

648
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:49,440
Like the age that we're in right now, it honestly feels like the Internet is falling apart to

649
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
a certain extent.

650
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,920
Like, first you have the nonsense going on with Reddit, which sucks because I did use

651
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
a third party app to view Reddit.

652
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,960
And I've tried using their app to view it.

653
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
It's awful.

654
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
It's really bad.

655
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
It's really.

656
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,000
So, OK, I'll make this really quick.

657
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,840
So Reddit basically is trying to do an IPO to do a dissertation like the one I provided

658
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
earlier.

659
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,440
But so we're going to try to try to make it very quick.

660
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,660
They're trying to do an IPO so that they can make more money.

661
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:25,840
And I guess so that's spaz the owner of Reddit or CEO or whatever can get out of the company.

662
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:33,720
So they're trying to make it, you know, valuable for their shareholders, potential shareholders

663
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,060
to invest in the company.

664
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,580
So as that they wanted to stop third party apps because there's a potential that they

665
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,020
could block ads and some of them may have blocked some of the ads or posts or whatever

666
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
that they had.

667
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,800
But that's not only what they did, though, they also provided like, you know, accessibility

668
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
stuff.

669
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,500
They made it a lot easier to view things.

670
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,420
They were a lot more performant than Reddit stuff is because Reddit auto plays their official

671
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,220
app, auto plays every single video that's on the page as you scroll by and it uses a

672
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,700
ton more bandwidth than the other apps, which is annoying.

673
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,860
So they did all that stuff.

674
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:15,380
So the way they got they shut down the third party apps, as they said, instead of it being

675
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,740
free to access stuff through the API, we're going to charge you X number of dollars per,

676
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,820
you know, number of views per user or whatever.

677
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,220
So it ended up being like, for example, I think Reddit is fun or Apollo one of those,

678
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:35,340
I can't remember that they said it would cost them like $20 million a year to run that through

679
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,980
Reddit, whereas they're not making that kind of money.

680
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,980
So essentially, he each really made it really expensive for them to run these third party

681
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
apps.

682
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,700
So essentially shutting them down.

683
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,400
Along with that, though, there's been protests, you had people blacking out like different

684
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,280
subreddits in protest.

685
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,000
So what he did is he took those mods and kicked them out.

686
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,800
And he's now opening them back up.

687
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,960
He's basically forcing this stuff open.

688
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,880
But then there's other reds are protesting by like posting pictures of john Oliver, which

689
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
is funny.

690
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
I love that.

691
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,760
So, you know, so they have that stuff.

692
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,440
But it's just it's a big old mess.

693
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,940
There's companies leaving like the Minecraft devs stop putting stuff on there now.

694
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,640
So they've said bye, we're not doing we're not posting on Reddit anymore.

695
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
So you have that they have GIF cat, which is another site that was used a lot with Reddit

696
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,760
to post all the wonderful GIFs on there.

697
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,300
They're shutting down September.

698
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,000
So all of the stuff that's on there, all of that's gonna be gone all these broken links.

699
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Awesome.

700
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,720
And then you have Twitter doing Twitter things.

701
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,800
So it's like, all these different platforms and social media and stuff are just like kinda

702
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,840
say, Okay, well, where are we going next?

703
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,600
Because like, same thing happened way back in the day with like digging stuff like everyone

704
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,360
I was gonna say, I don't think the internet's dying.

705
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,480
I think it's evolving.

706
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,080
You know, and I understand that there's a bunch of websites used to be part of our daily

707
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,920
and you just named one dig.

708
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,440
Live Journal, of course, is what we've been talking about lately.

709
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,440
You know, I met my husband on Live Journal, fuck, probably all of our relationships and

710
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,240
OLR like was enhanced because of Live Journal and the deep, you know, relationships that

711
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,160
you could really build on that website, but obviously, it's long gone.

712
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,560
I mean, it's, it's there in name, but only in named, let's be real at this point.

713
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,320
It, it really actually still functions exactly the same.

714
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
It does.

715
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,720
But, you know, number one, the fact that it's, you know, Russian owned in this, you know,

716
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,520
global, you know, world, yes, it is an issue, fundamentally, it's the same app, people don't

717
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,280
know what's going on behind it.

718
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Yeah.

719
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,200
And a lot of, you know, people's tastes, you know, evolved to what was going on with, you

720
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,040
know, Twitter, Live Journal, but then of course, where did face or excuse me, Twitter, my Facebook,

721
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,600
but where did my space, you know, lead to Facebook and that type of stuff.

722
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,560
And of course, my space then went under, you know, and, and there's, there's lots of websites

723
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
that, you know, they come and go.

724
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,520
And honestly, Twitter's, if you want to see what's going to happen to Twitter, look at

725
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,940
Live Journal, functionally, it will still be the same.

726
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,560
But by that point, everybody will have left.

727
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,760
So except for maybe one random country that decides to embrace it, like it's, or the new

728
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,640
owners decide to invest in that, you know, or whatever.

729
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
So it's sure.

730
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Yeah, I know.

731
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
It's not like the end of the world.

732
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
It's just the inner.

733
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
It's like some of the parts of the internet.

734
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,960
It's just it makes it less convenient for things, I guess.

735
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,480
It's not like, you know, it was, I don't remember too much with dig because that was a while

736
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,480
ago.

737
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,560
But it was pretty obvious like, okay, while going here, like, now it's like, what if I

738
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
have a FARC?

739
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,160
That was the website with the Photoshop contest.

740
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,040
That was the one I don't think I've ever heard of that.

741
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Really?

742
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,680
I think it was around the same time as dig.

743
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,840
But yeah, I'm sure it'll all be fine like, you know, things will fall in place wherever

744
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
they are.

745
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
But like, I don't know.

746
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,640
It's just, it's interesting that it's like all happening at one time like it's, I don't

747
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
know.

748
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
All right.

749
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Thank you.

750
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,040
Thank gosh, someone else remembers that fifth dream in chat says I used to go there all

751
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
day.

752
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
All right.

753
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Anyway, moving on my gaming week.

754
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Sorry about my gaming week.

755
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Obviously, I don't have a ton to talk about because I've still been playing Final Fantasy

756
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,920
16 all week.

757
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,840
And yeah, pretty much everything I said last week hasn't really changed.

758
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
Love the story.

759
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Love where it's going.

760
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,080
Very interesting side quests, surprising amount of depth in the side quest.

761
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,860
I was really there's a couple that really I was like, wow, this is this is some deep

762
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,880
stuff in these side quests.

763
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,240
So I was really impressed with that.

764
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,000
But the only you know, again, kind of going back to you know, is it a perfect game new?

765
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,960
There's some things where it's showing its weakness.

766
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,840
I'm not sure it's a 10 out of 10 game.

767
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,400
It's probably a nine out of 10 but but some things holding it back.

768
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,420
Like, honestly, the shop and the crafting system feel like they're only there because

769
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,320
they have to be.

770
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,140
There's no real sense of choice in either of those systems or freedom or interesting

771
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,720
things going on with that.

772
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,280
So you know, that's that's my biggest thing where I'm like, why is this even here?

773
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,240
This feels tacked on because like somebody would complain it's not a Final Fantasy game

774
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,640
if it doesn't have shops and Gil and all that but like literally I'm hounding Gil with nothing

775
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,200
to spend it on, which I find very interesting.

776
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,140
But at the end of the day, it's more about the story, the gameplay, the experience and

777
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,440
all of that has been really stellar.

778
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,480
So that's my thought on that.

779
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,680
But that isn't the only thing I've been playing this week.

780
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,780
I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, honestly, because I've been trying

781
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,320
to stream and or record all of my 16 gameplay.

782
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,920
I have it all archived on my YouTube channel at this point, either my streams from Twitch,

783
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,920
or side quest stuff that I just recorded, I didn't stream, it's all on my YouTube channel.

784
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,320
But you know, sometimes I want to play something else.

785
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,200
So I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight.

786
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,380
But also, randomly, because it was on sale on the PlayStation Store, I forgot that this

787
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,040
game had come out and I actually kind of wanted it.

788
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,980
I bought today the Atari 50 collection, the 50th anniversary Atari that actually has a

789
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:03,320
pretty good lineup of like 2600 games, arcade games, and yes, even Jaguar games.

790
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:10,280
So you know, the first game I played several for a little bit was Tempest 2000.

791
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,240
And I got my super zapper recharge.

792
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,720
And I remembered how awesome that game was, because that game is fucking fabulous.

793
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,560
So that was, yeah, that was a good good time.

794
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,100
You know what I should do?

795
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:28,760
I should send you like all of the the rips I made off of the Sega Saturn disk.

796
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,240
Actually that might be it was all it was all Redbook.

797
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,960
That might make for some fun, like raid and bit donation, you know, Twitch ambient noises.

798
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,160
I bet super zapper recharge would be a fun one for something maybe a new follow or something.

799
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,000
So I yeah, I it's great.

800
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,560
Darja says the museum stuff is so in depth.

801
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,560
It's wild.

802
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,240
Yeah, I started to browse it a little bit.

803
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,280
It is kind of like, it's like fucking Microsoft and Carta, but all about the Atari and on

804
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
the PlayStation.

805
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,320
It's like all of these things to read about.

806
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,800
And I was reading, you know, obviously, it starts at the very beginning.

807
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,160
So there was some stuff on computer space.

808
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,200
And there's an interview in there where the guy, one of the target guys talks about that

809
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,600
he tracked down just a few years ago, like 15 years ago, the very first computer space

810
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:22,120
machine that was ever made, he was actually able to find it, you know, where he found

811
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:28,400
it, Dixon, California, in a warehouse, really, it was it was sitting there and he talks about

812
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,240
like, the yellow, like, because the guy apparently was selling them for like $5,000 each, and

813
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,400
there were all these different colors.

814
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,320
He's like, Where did he get these?

815
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,980
And then he took a friend that I mean, it's all under the collection.

816
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:46,300
And it goes, he goes, I realized this was like the Atari co founders actual collection.

817
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,880
And this was computer space.

818
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,040
The yellow one was the very first computer space machine.

819
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,120
So he bought it and he has it for himself now.

820
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,840
But I that cracked me up because he's sitting there going, Yeah, we found it in Dixon, California,

821
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,520
which is a little, you know, pullaway town between San Francisco and Sacramento.

822
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,480
I'm like, I know exactly where Dixon is.

823
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,880
I've been there way too many times.

824
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880
Unfortunately,

825
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,880
that's also where Pinagogo is.

826
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,880
The pinball thing is.

827
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,880
Yeah, I still do Pinagogo.

828
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Yeah.

829
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,360
And I can't go because it's corn season.

830
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Yeah.

831
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,360
So.

832
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:20,240
But yeah, so it's interviews like that, you know, that, that make it very interesting.

833
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,560
So they put it together like an interactive documentary.

834
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
It's pretty cool.

835
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
And of course, the games in there.

836
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,960
I also played a little bit of the yards revenge reimagined.

837
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,000
The only thing I don't like that's happening is that Atari is like going in like all these

838
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,320
different directions.

839
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:39,880
So they released like a yards revenge reimagined on steam recently.

840
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:47,680
This is not that this is like literally the, you know, 4k cartridge from the 2600 but completely

841
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,800
redone with like, like new graphics but in the style of old graphics.

842
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,080
It's hard to explain.

843
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,960
It looks really cool though like and I enjoy playing it because yards yards revenge to

844
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,720
this day has solid fucking gameplay.

845
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,000
It's a good game.

846
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,260
So it was fun to go back and play it.

847
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,160
So yeah, I think there's a lot of games in the collection.

848
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,520
I think it's I think it's well done, you know, especially for whatever it cost me being on

849
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,600
PlayStation Plus $27 or something like that was a really good deal and I bet this game

850
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,440
will come down to $19.99 I'm sure at some point, I think that would be the sweet spot

851
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,440
for a lot of people.

852
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,320
So yeah, I think Atari 50 is worth checking out.

853
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,000
If nothing else, go play those Jaguar games.

854
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,360
None of them are very good except tempest 2000.

855
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,520
But it's a it's a good trip down memory lane.

856
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,760
And honestly, tempest 2000 is worth the price alone.

857
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,880
Like it's tempest 2000 plus a lot of other cool games.

858
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,480
So I'm doing something for you right now, Rob.

859
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,600
Oh, just for the sake of our listeners.

860
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
Okay.

861
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,000
So give me a second.

862
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
All right.

863
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm making sure that you get this.

864
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay.

865
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,720
Because this is why everyone in the universe needs the soundtrack.

866
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,520
All right, and I did it through discord.

867
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,520
So you're welcome.

868
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:05,280
Oh, um, I can't hold on because this is just I can't exactly bring up the discord easy.

869
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,760
I thought that you were in.

870
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
Nevermind.

871
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
Don't worry about it.

872
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,560
I actually have the the first big track apart from the intro for tempest 2000 in my collection.

873
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,480
Okay, wait, hold on, because what I can do.

874
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,080
Let me quickly do I didn't mean to completely derail things, but I figured people need to

875
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,080
know Oh, girl, when don't you derail things on this program?

876
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,080
Hey.

877
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,080
Okay.

878
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,080
Okay.

879
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,880
So what we can do is we could have found you a Oh, there we go.

880
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,520
Um, except Oh, shit, now I do this as classic game.

881
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,880
Now I can't access discord.

882
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,960
I have to do that real quick and drag it over here.

883
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,960
Okay.

884
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,960
I'm sorry.

885
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
Okay.

886
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Okay.

887
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,960
Okay.

888
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,440
Yeah.

889
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Oh, yeah.

890
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,600
Oh, this is really good quality.

891
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
This is better quality.

892
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,800
I think that's in the that's in the actual try 50 collection.

893
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,000
So I know you guys can't hear it through discord but listeners can hear.

894
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:08,040
This is the actual like 90s techno mortal combat.

895
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:15,480
But this is this was 1996 97 around then maybe earlier than that, but I mean, this is what

896
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,120
I was listening to in college when I wasn't listening to Radiohead.

897
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,220
If I listen to this in the car, I'm going to pause this now and go back.

898
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:26,240
If I listen to this car, I in the car, I would drive very fast.

899
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,380
I would drive very, very fast if I had to listen to this for sure.

900
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,000
So yeah.

901
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:40,400
These were the ones that were ripped off the Saturn disk.

902
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,360
Because the Saturn disk was all red book.

903
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
Yeah.

904
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Yeah.

905
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
All right.

906
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360
Tempest 2000.

907
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Fun game.

908
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
All right.

909
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,920
With that, let's get into some news.

910
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,040
We have some headlines to tackle tonight.

911
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:59,720
And of course, the ongoing courtroom saga that we've been talking about for months and

912
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,560
months and years as the acquisition turns as the acquisition turns.

913
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,480
What's the latest Loki?

914
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:17,360
So Sony or Microsoft says it's Tony's fault that we have console exclusives because, yes,

915
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:23,400
it says if it was up to me, I would love to get rid of entire exclusive or entire exclusives

916
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,680
on consoles.

917
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:30,640
But that's not for me to define as a low share player in the console market, Nadella said.

918
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,740
The dominant player there, Sony, has defined the market competition using exclusives.

919
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,440
So that's the world we live in.

920
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,140
And I have no love for that world.

921
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,140
I don't believe that.

922
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,420
Wasn't Nintendo doing it first anyway?

923
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,420
I don't know.

924
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,540
But I also don't believe that.

925
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,540
So you know.

926
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,540
Yeah.

927
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:56,840
I'm like the idea of exclusive goes back to honestly, the Atari and the Intellivision

928
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,520
and all the systems that were out at that time.

929
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,220
All these companies are making the combat was an Atari exclusive.

930
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,220
They both do it.

931
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,220
Yeah.

932
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,220
They both do it.

933
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,180
It's not just like because I think what was it?

934
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:13,420
Tomb Raider was an exclusive on Xbox for a year as well.

935
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,420
Second one was.

936
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,420
Yeah.

937
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,420
Yeah.

938
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,420
Maybe the third one.

939
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,420
One of them.

940
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,420
One of them was.

941
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,420
Yeah.

942
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,420
Yeah.

943
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,180
So it's like it's not just like a Sony thing.

944
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,540
I don't know, like it's so dirty, like I just want this to be over with already.

945
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,060
Like I'm so sick of it.

946
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:38,020
It's just it's pathetic to hear these companies going, well, it's just not fair that you do

947
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,020
it that way.

948
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,900
And then I do this and it's just not fair.

949
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,500
The world is not fair for us multi-billion dollar companies.

950
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:52,340
I think another way to put it is incredibly transparent how the lawyers are twisting shit

951
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,460
to get what they want.

952
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,460
Of course.

953
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,460
Of course.

954
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,460
That's what it is.

955
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,460
Yeah.

956
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,460
They're going to make the argument.

957
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,460
And I hope.

958
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,460
Which is what our legal system is founded on.

959
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,460
Yeah.

960
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,460
Yeah.

961
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,460
I hope.

962
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,460
Who can argue that?

963
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,460
However, you know, FTC.

964
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:12,220
You know, I hope that our government is smart enough to see through that, but.

965
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,220
Are they?

966
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,220
Are they?

967
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,220
Will they, though?

968
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,780
They're like, well, they said that Sony does it, so I guess I have to believe that face

969
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780
value.

970
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,780
Sure.

971
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,780
I'll take the word for it.

972
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,780
I trust everybody.

973
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,780
100 percent.

974
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,780
I'm sorry.

975
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,220
I'm I'm I'm laughing.

976
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,820
There's something else, too, that I referred I'd referred to earlier, like because Niantic

977
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,820
was a part of this.

978
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,820
Right.

979
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,820
Yeah.

980
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,640
So then there's also some emails that came out talking about different acquisition plans.

981
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,240
So Microsoft, of course, in the buying mood of different companies, they had looked at

982
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,780
purchasing other companies outside of Activision Blizzard before settling on them.

983
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:55,540
So for example, some of those included Sega requiring Bungee Niantic, IO Interactive and

984
00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:02,660
Zynga to help bolster its Gains Pass service.

985
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:08,660
They said that we believe that Sega has a well built or built a well-balanced portfolio

986
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,940
of games across global segments and global geographic appeal, and that will help accelerate

987
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,100
Game Pass both on and off console.

988
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,520
All I'm saying is it's still not too late.

989
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,140
You know, you could still purchase Sega as well.

990
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,860
I mean, I don't know if this all falls through.

991
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:28,100
And like, they're just going to go, OK, fine.

992
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,340
You know, it's kind of like going on that like.

993
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:37,940
Like retail therapy after a bad breakup or something like that, it's like, well, you

994
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,740
know, I got to make up for retail therapy, but I guess I guess I'm just going to have

995
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:48,540
to purchase some more companies then, you know, I mean, all those all those Microsoft

996
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,020
buying Sega rumors came from somewhere.

997
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,020
Microsoft may not have bought Sega, but they definitely deepened that relationship.

998
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,380
I mean, hello, Phantasy Star Online, too.

999
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,340
Like the whole reason we have that is because Microsoft kind of stepped in to make that

1000
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,340
happen.

1001
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,340
Right.

1002
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,560
So, you know, there's that.

1003
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,820
So yeah.

1004
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,500
It's interesting to see that some things did come of that whole situation.

1005
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Right.

1006
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,540
So, yeah, I'm surprised they found value in Zynga, but I mean, you know, it's cool.

1007
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,540
Yeah.

1008
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,540
Somebody did.

1009
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,640
All right.

1010
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,000
Let's move on and talk about Blizzcon.

1011
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Blizzcon's coming back.

1012
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,040
You know, we haven't had Blizzcon in a few years.

1013
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:33,920
You know, the pandemic happened and, you know, a lot has been happening with Activision Blizzard.

1014
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,960
I don't need to go back and talk about it.

1015
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,960
But obviously, they have not been in the public's favor as a result.

1016
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,360
But things are, you know, as we start to learn that that exists everywhere in the gaming

1017
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,000
industry and we sort of accept that, you know, at some point, Activision is going to get

1018
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,980
bought by somebody and Bobby Kotick is no longer going to be in charge, let's hope for

1019
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,980
God's sake.

1020
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,980
Someday.

1021
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:56,980
Hopefully.

1022
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,720
And that Blizzard has kind of had some wins on their hands lately, like Dragonfly, pretty

1023
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,200
good WoW expansion, better than the other recent ones.

1024
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,480
Diablo 4, really fucking good the way it turned out.

1025
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,960
So Blizzard has been kind of winning stuff lately and it's been winning back some of

1026
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,000
their fans as a result.

1027
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So Blizzcon is going to happen and it will be priced at $300.

1028
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,600
If you would like to go to Blizzcon, you'll get access to all halls, the Blizzcon store

1029
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:30,080
on Thursday, you know, spending money to spend more money, Blizzcon in-game goodies and a

1030
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,080
Blizzcon backpack.

1031
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,080
Ooh.

1032
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,400
Well, you know what, if standing in line doesn't sound like fun to you, then you can get the

1033
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,480
Portal Pass, $800.

1034
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,080
Games you also access to an exclusive lounge, a separate registration line, a separate security

1035
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,040
line, and even early convention entry so you can go run and line up for whatever games

1036
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,040
you want to play because they're showing it, which I would imagine, I don't know what they're

1037
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,040
going to show.

1038
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,200
I feel like it'd be too early to unveil a Diablo expansion.

1039
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,040
Overwatch is in a weird place.

1040
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,560
Maybe the next WoW expansion, maybe something's brewing in the StarCraft universe.

1041
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,360
We haven't heard from that for a long time.

1042
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,360
That's true.

1043
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:10,280
It could be time to talk about StarCraft 3 or something in that universe.

1044
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,440
I don't know.

1045
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:18,120
But clearly Blizzard has something they want to show because I swear to God, if they charge

1046
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:25,400
people $300 just to do that year where don't you all have cell phones, it's over for Blizzcon

1047
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,840
to be quite honest.

1048
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,060
Is it though?

1049
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,060
Is it over?

1050
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:34,560
You know what, that's a fair point because most people go to Blizzcon to hang out with

1051
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,840
their WoW friends, or Overwatch Diablo friends, but mostly WoW.

1052
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,440
Some people just go to Discon.

1053
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,360
Which is, is that just Disneyland afterwards?

1054
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,520
That's when you go to Disneyland after Blizzcon.

1055
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,280
Or the hotel pre-, I went one year, yeah, because Alan and I went to Disneyland, and

1056
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,120
then we went to the pre-parties for Blizzcon and the post-parties, but we just went to

1057
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:00,600
Disneyland during the actual con, so there was that.

1058
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,640
Let's see.

1059
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:09,200
There also will be a virtual ticket, and it's gonna be free.

1060
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
Which is interesting.

1061
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,200
A virtual ticket is still an optional purchase, I think that gets you the stuff in-game if

1062
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,840
you do that.

1063
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,720
So that's kind of interesting, but you can watch the livestreams for free because it

1064
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,000
would be silly if you couldn't watch the livestreams.

1065
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,320
I have heard that there's some weird stuff going on though, where like they're not even

1066
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,280
doing the announcements in Hall D this year.

1067
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,400
They're doing it in the arena, which means the arena can only hold so many people, and

1068
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,080
the rest of the convention center's gonna be for overflow.

1069
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,960
So even if you buy a $300 ticket, you may not get to go to the opening ceremonies live.

1070
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,440
There's just some weird shit going on with this year's Blizzcon, and I don't know.

1071
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,240
But people will have to make up their mind, because tickets go on sale July 8th at 10

1072
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,080
AM, the first wave, and the second wave July 22nd at 10 AM.

1073
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,960
Blizzcon, by the way, is in Anaheim from November 3rd through the 4th.

1074
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,760
I mean, I don't know.

1075
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,240
What's going on over here?

1076
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,560
Sorry, suddenly a full screen ad started playing.

1077
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,560
Sorry about that.

1078
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,640
Oh, the Tempest video was still running, and then it ran an ad in the middle of it.

1079
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,720
My bad.

1080
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:23,360
But anyway, yeah, I'm curious to see what they're gonna announce to justify that cost.

1081
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,400
Maybe a new IP or something up their sleeve.

1082
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,320
Oh, Hearthstone has been quiet for a little while.

1083
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
That's a good point, Fifth Dream.

1084
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,920
I don't know if we've seen anything out of Hearthstone for a while.

1085
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,920
We'll see.

1086
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,920
All right.

1087
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,480
I think Dark Soccer, I heard you back, yeah?

1088
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,720
Yeah, I'm back.

1089
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,720
Okay.

1090
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,400
Your camera stopped for whatever reason.

1091
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,400
But what is on?

1092
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,360
Oh, because I didn't turn it back on.

1093
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,360
There you go.

1094
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,360
All right.

1095
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,360
What's next for you?

1096
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:54,560
So a game that I love, that I actually kind of miss playing with certain people, Among

1097
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,600
Us.

1098
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,080
We love Among Us, don't we?

1099
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,920
Well, it's getting an animated series.

1100
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,960
They are working with, actually, hold on, let me just go ahead and, yeah, IndieSloth

1101
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:20,240
is working with CBSi animation to make this a reality.

1102
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,280
It definitely, I think, is about time.

1103
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,040
I mean, because it was, it's one of those games that came up and rose really sharply

1104
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,720
and then it had this really quick decline and then came back up.

1105
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:44,600
And so I'm hoping it has the same sort of weird humor that the game keeps as well.

1106
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:50,880
I want something a little bit more adult and subversive than just for kids.

1107
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,480
But I think this is going to be a lot of fun.

1108
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,480
I'm looking forward to it.

1109
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:04,280
So just as long as there's spikes going through people's heads and random gunshots and people

1110
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,920
being set on fire, I'm happy with that.

1111
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,280
Sounds like a lovely kid's show.

1112
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:15,080
I wonder if even there might be like a spy versus spy element to it.

1113
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,080
I think.

1114
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,080
Oh, I could see that.

1115
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,080
I could see that.

1116
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,080
Yeah.

1117
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,520
As Stuart Hunter Matt says, so glad Owen Dennis working on this, he did a great job on Infinity

1118
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
Train.

1119
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,520
Yeah.

1120
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,120
Yeah, it'd be cute.

1121
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
So we'll see.

1122
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
We'll see what comes of that.

1123
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:33,600
I wouldn't mind if it was kind of like a dark humor type of thing, you know, where it can

1124
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,840
still be like kid appropriate, but it's a little bit morbid, like like the Addams Family.

1125
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,680
It's kind of like that, you know.

1126
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,720
I would I would argue that.

1127
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
Well, I don't know.

1128
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,760
Yeah, I see it.

1129
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,680
Maybe I'm just thinking the Addams Family today, because today I was randomly thinking

1130
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:55,560
of Debbie Jelinski from Addams Family values and how Joan Cusack is the is the the most

1131
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,600
perfect supporting actress ever in a motion picture in that role.

1132
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,120
Debbie Jelinski is the best supporting actress ever in a motion picture, period.

1133
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,520
Did you did you see like my posts on and well, I know that you're not doing the Twitter thing

1134
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,280
so much anymore, but I actually wanted to I'd get cut off.

1135
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,600
Don't I deserve love and jewelry?

1136
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,480
Did you ever watch Wednesday?

1137
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,520
I need to.

1138
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,800
I saw a couple episodes in the background at a friend's house, but I have it and it

1139
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,440
was the dance episode to the one that Yeah.

1140
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,760
But I haven't watched it start to finish.

1141
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,760
I need to.

1142
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,760
But it was pretty good.

1143
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,760
I liked it.

1144
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,760
You look cute.

1145
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,520
It was it was like kind of I don't know.

1146
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,520
It was it was pretty good.

1147
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,660
I don't know.

1148
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:46,400
It felt like a Harry Potter TV series, but not without the without the transphobia.

1149
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,400
Yeah, it's great.

1150
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,840
Yes, exactly.

1151
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:57,920
As we were saying, I was going to say and then I also said, so I have to use persuasion

1152
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:04,800
and slides as my two favorite lines, as Joe and Matt says, Infinity Train had a ton of

1153
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,280
dark humor, a very deep mystery that was kid appropriate.

1154
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,280
OK, sounds interesting.

1155
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
Could be interesting.

1156
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,280
All right.

1157
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,640
I want something like Rocky and Bullwinkle way where kids can watch it and laugh.

1158
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,280
And then when you go back as an adult who actually knows the history of the era.

1159
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,040
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

1160
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,520
Tiny toons and Animaniacs were very Animaniacs.

1161
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,520
Yeah.

1162
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,520
Yeah.

1163
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,520
And Freakazoid.

1164
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,620
That's a great humor, for sure.

1165
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:31,660
That takes talent in writing to get that to go off.

1166
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:36,120
And such such a missed opportunity Warner Brothers for not making a live action Freakazoid

1167
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,400
movie with Jim Carrey like probably 20 years ago.

1168
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
Amazing.

1169
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
All right.

1170
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,920
Well, speaking of things that have had to pivot pretty quick, Loki.

1171
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
Yes.

1172
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:59,720
So Daedalic put out a game, maybe, maybe you can classify it as a game, Lord of the Rings

1173
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,060
Golem.

1174
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,240
It was awful.

1175
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,600
It was absolutely all around awful.

1176
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,360
And originally the studio was poised to make.

1177
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,640
Golem as a character is not good, too.

1178
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,760
I'm going to go.

1179
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,000
Let's start there.

1180
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Let's start that like the most annoying part of those movies.

1181
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,440
Golem is a means to an end in the books and in general.

1182
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,680
The most annoying things in that movie who said let's put them in a starring role in

1183
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,680
the game.

1184
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,680
First mistake.

1185
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:32,280
Yeah, it was bad corrupted hobbit who kills people as you're, you know, well, on top of

1186
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:38,240
that game out of Liv Tyler, she's pretty it the game itself was really awful in the sense

1187
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,960
that even with the Golem character, it was just you're in jail for a while and you're

1188
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,840
doing jail things and it's stupid.

1189
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:51,920
And that's beyond like if you don't even look at the technical parts of the game, which

1190
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,720
it was just awful all around awful gameplay, awful everything.

1191
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:02,280
The game lagged out people's PCs while displaying the credits at the end of the game.

1192
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,400
That's how bad it is.

1193
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,400
It's so bad.

1194
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,160
OK, anyways, so the studio, of course, apologized for the state that Golem was in.

1195
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,600
Then, of course, they kind of put out this statement saying even though Lord of the Rings

1196
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,280
Golem did not live up to expectations we had for the game.

1197
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,360
Yeah, like by a mile.

1198
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:29,480
We are very grateful for this opportunity and learning experience it brought us.

1199
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:36,040
It's a difficult break, but also a new beginning in the long history of Daedalic entertainment.

1200
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,160
We value each and every one of them.

1201
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:44,800
Anyways, basically somebody I'm assuming the Embracer group said, Hey, you're making more

1202
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,400
games for this because like originally they were going to make like, I think, eight different

1203
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,720
Lord of the Rings games.

1204
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:55,040
Yeah, you're touching any more of this property.

1205
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:02,200
So because of they also said that they twenty five of it, like at this point, they're not

1206
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,440
even going to be allowed to adapt the book.

1207
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,000
Everybody poops like that.

1208
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,440
That's just this game company is done.

1209
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,400
The only thing that pooped was the game.

1210
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,840
It was just it was.

1211
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,840
No, the game.

1212
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:18,840
The game was the gas we pass the less talked about sequel.

1213
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,120
They were written by different authors, so just part of a series.

1214
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,880
And I think I have most of them.

1215
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,420
I actually do have the gas we pass and everyone poops and a couple of the others.

1216
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,820
And I still consider Go the Fuck to Sleep a part of that that trilogy, even though it

1217
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:41,900
isn't actually related, it is my head canon.

1218
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,780
I think there's like six books in the series.

1219
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:50,500
You know, if there's anything that we learn from this game, it's you don't preorder games.

1220
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:56,100
That's what can be learned from this game because you don't preorder games that you

1221
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,220
don't know.

1222
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,540
That you don't trust the reputation of the of the publisher.

1223
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:07,840
Yes, but to that effect, if we were going to go with that logic, then we get cyberpunk

1224
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,900
and you know, we know what happened with cyberpunk.

1225
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:17,620
So it's I think it's you wait for the reviews to come out because you don't really necessarily

1226
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,980
need those preorder bonuses because a lot of times it's just nonsense.

1227
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:29,380
Oh, by the way, they also tried to sell DLC with this, one of which added elvish language

1228
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,980
to the game, which elves are in the game for such a small period of time.

1229
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:37,100
It's like almost insignificant altogether.

1230
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:42,200
And they added like some moat for Gollum to like swat at flies in a game of single player.

1231
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,260
Why do you need a moat at all?

1232
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,660
What's the point of that?

1233
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,660
Yes.

1234
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,660
Disgusting.

1235
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,660
Bad all around.

1236
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,900
Like a disgusting.

1237
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,900
It's awful.

1238
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,900
Yeah.

1239
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:58,140
Ah, um, TigerClawn chat raises a good point worth bringing up.

1240
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,740
It's unfortunate because even developers make bad games but managed to come back when they

1241
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,020
made a good one.

1242
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,860
I mean, it is a fair point.

1243
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,940
We've seen developers that make bad games, but they come around and they make a good

1244
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,940
one.

1245
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:15,100
You know, just because you make one bad game doesn't mean you're gonna make bad games forever.

1246
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,920
Case in point, you've got ET playing behind you there.

1247
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,780
Howard Scott Warshaw, who made ET made some of the greatest Atari 2600 games around.

1248
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:25,300
We know, you know, if you do your history, you know, you know that, you know, there were

1249
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:30,140
other circumstances at play with ET, such as deadlines and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1250
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,540
Y'all know where I'm going with this.

1251
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:37,820
So is a publisher that makes a bad game doomed to always make a bad game?

1252
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,060
So I mean, even though we're looking at this going, haha, the Gollum developers, that game

1253
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,120
was so bad, we knew this is gonna happen.

1254
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,660
No one's like saying, wishing for the game to be bad.

1255
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,940
It's just, it was bad.

1256
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,740
I think it was even a delayed game that they deleted to make it better.

1257
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,580
But it was like, like, how does that even ship?

1258
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:58,580
Like who?

1259
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,580
Yeah.

1260
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,580
Who?

1261
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:01,580
Who signed off on that?

1262
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,580
That's what it is.

1263
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,900
Who came up with those micro transaction things that are ridiculous?

1264
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Yeah.

1265
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,020
Well, they signed off on releasing the game like that.

1266
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,860
Like that's, that's, that's what needs to happen.

1267
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,860
Yeah.

1268
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,500
Micro transactions aside, like you could just play the game and see like, oh, this is not

1269
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,500
ready to go.

1270
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,780
Like, and I get it.

1271
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,420
There's some, some of it might be, well, we're going to get backlash.

1272
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,380
Well, we as maybe not the publisher, the publisher is probably not getting backlash.

1273
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,940
Everyone's looking at the developer.

1274
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,660
This developer didn't publish this game.

1275
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,020
A publisher did.

1276
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:35,140
And the publisher is the one responsible for saying, yeah, that's good to go to market.

1277
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:38,580
So like, why aren't we getting mad at, I assume it's the eraser group.

1278
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:41,460
I think that has the studio, like, why are we getting mad at them?

1279
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,620
Like because they signed off on it.

1280
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:44,620
Problems right now.

1281
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,740
They don't need this on top of that, which, well, they do add this on top of that, unfortunately.

1282
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:55,660
Well, manage your developers better than maybe, you know, you know, if you saw this obviously

1283
01:09:55,660 --> 01:10:01,940
was in bad shape for a very long time, it didn't just suddenly happen like, sorry.

1284
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,620
It probably should have been canceled years ago.

1285
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,620
Yeah.

1286
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:09,780
You know, when it hit one of its benchmarks, somebody should have seen that this was terrible.

1287
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,300
So missed, missed it on that.

1288
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:17,180
And then on top of that, like, as you mentioned, like, even at the very best, it's a golem

1289
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,180
game.

1290
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,980
Like, yeah, exactly.

1291
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,620
Take the worst character in Lord of the Rings and make the movies anyway, and make, make

1292
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,860
a video game out of them.

1293
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,860
Really?

1294
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,860
Whose idea was that?

1295
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:29,860
All right.

1296
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,860
Moving on.

1297
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,060
Let's talk about Nintendo.

1298
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:36,140
Somebody that somebody that could get away with putting a bad game out there is actually

1299
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:40,620
you want to talk about a studios that have made bad games occasionally, but then come

1300
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,700
around and make really, really, really good ones like Tears of the Kingdom or what have

1301
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,620
you, you know, plenty of good games from Nintendo.

1302
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,260
Nintendo is thinking about their next console.

1303
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,260
Of course they are.

1304
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,020
They've been thinking about it for some time.

1305
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,340
And they actually said in a shareholder meeting that because they were asked if your Nintendo

1306
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:00,140
Switch purchases would carry over to future game consoles.

1307
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:05,320
So the CEO and President Shintaro Furukawa said in the transition from Nintendo Switch

1308
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,300
to the next generation console, we would like to make every effort to ensure that customers

1309
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,820
can make the transition smoothly while using their Nintendo account.

1310
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:18,620
So it seems to imply that Nintendo Switch titles purchased in the eShop will carry over

1311
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,740
to what comes next.

1312
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,140
But we don't know that for sure, but at least your account will move over because now you

1313
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:29,260
have that central Nintendo account and you don't have to make like a console specific

1314
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:33,220
account like you did on like 3DS, Wii U and everything else before that.

1315
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,780
Everything is now on that Nintendo account.

1316
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,780
I'm going to call it right now.

1317
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,780
I'm going to say it right now.

1318
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:44,740
100% I guarantee 100% this system will not be backwards compatible with the Switch.

1319
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,740
100%.

1320
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:49,340
The only thing that will come over is your Nintendo Switch, your Nintendo online account,

1321
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,820
just like it did from the 3DS to the Switch.

1322
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:55,820
100% guarantee it will never be backwards compatible with those games.

1323
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:56,820
Why?

1324
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:57,820
Because they don't know how to do it.

1325
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:02,220
And also because the Switch is so old anyways that they just won't be able to do some sort

1326
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,820
of compatibility, even though like the Steam Deck can run it.

1327
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:11,220
I mean, certainly another console could probably pull off emulation for that, but for whatever

1328
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,380
reason they won't do it.

1329
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,540
It will not be backwards compatible.

1330
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:19,140
I'm not so fast to put my head, hedge my bets on that.

1331
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,620
I, you know, I'm looking at a DS 3DS kind of situation.

1332
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:28,780
I think Nintendo knows they have a winner with the Switch and I don't think they're

1333
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:32,620
going to be quick to repeat the mistakes of the Wii U and radically shake up the formula

1334
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:36,020
that's working for them, at least not for this next console.

1335
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:40,260
I do think the next console Nintendo puts out is basically going to be a Super Switch.

1336
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,260
I could be wrong.

1337
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:45,540
I think I think the Super Switch or whatever, and this is for lack of a better name, it

1338
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:51,860
will have some quirky new mechanic that separates it a little bit, maybe like a camera built

1339
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:52,860
in.

1340
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,660
I don't know why my brain does that again.

1341
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,820
I don't know why my camera, I don't know why my brain wants to go to the VR AR space.

1342
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:03,140
I feel like it's a thing like Nintendo's like, I don't know, but we'll see.

1343
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:10,860
But I think it will be some sort of Switch, but with a little something extra.

1344
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:18,340
Well, I had already put out there once that it would be Switch 3D or Switch 3, meaning

1345
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:25,660
it would switch to handheld television and virtual reality.

1346
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:31,820
I know it's a long shot, but I feel like that would be the thing that Nintendo could

1347
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,500
do to make the new Switch quirky would be to say it does VR.

1348
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,900
We'll see though.

1349
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,460
But I think whatever it is, it will support the old games.

1350
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:44,340
But if they do something radically different and come up with a complete different type

1351
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,520
of console, then yeah, I'm with you, Loki.

1352
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,980
But I think just fundamentally, I don't think they deviate from the Switch that much.

1353
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,900
They're going back to cartridge.

1354
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,900
Going back to cartridges.

1355
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,380
Well, they're using cartridges now in a sense.

1356
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,100
So I mean, yeah, that's true.

1357
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,980
Yeah, go back to this.

1358
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,380
Yeah, go back to disks.

1359
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:02,880
There you go.

1360
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,820
Now you got it.

1361
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:10,820
All right, let's move on Dark Sakura.

1362
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,820
I put myself down a rabbit hole.

1363
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,420
I'm sorry.

1364
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,620
Anyway, good news coming up.

1365
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:22,220
So and I actually got into this a little bit with the coworker the other day.

1366
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:25,980
Steam, well, actually, I'll go back.

1367
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:35,220
There's a Reddit post that is hinting that Valve may be banning games made with AI art.

1368
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:45,260
It was basically noticed by the founder of Game Discover Co.

1369
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:51,100
Simon Carlos said that there was a message from Valve

1370
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:56,980
saying it cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all the necessary rights.

1371
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:04,300
And another person wrote that Steam denied their game for utilizing AI tech.

1372
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:13,140
And both of them had in common that some of their assets were AI generated.

1373
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:23,740
So, yeah, they're very quietly banning the games that include AI created art assets.

1374
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:29,540
Basically, if you can't prove that you own the right for the assets that trained those algorithms,

1375
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,540
you can't have the thing in there.

1376
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:36,100
No, no, no, no, that's not true for Steam.

1377
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:43,020
You will, it's not necessarily that they can ban you if you admit it.

1378
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:50,580
It's if you can't provide the proof, not necessarily an admission.

1379
01:15:50,580 --> 01:16:01,300
But at any rate, the rules themselves don't say anything about banning like AI made content,

1380
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:05,780
as opposed to how they do like blockchain stuff.

1381
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:11,740
But some of these ones have very obviously used AI generated art.

1382
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:21,860
And, I mean, basically, any of us who are artists, you know, or who do graphic design,

1383
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:32,100
or do, I mean, in general, it basically infringes on our potential ability to do this as a living,

1384
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:40,220
you know, if someone can go to an AI generator and say, I need a logo that does this stuff.

1385
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:46,180
What's to say they're not going to get that free logo with their, you know, mid journey account, right?

1386
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,100
I now I will say that I have played with it.

1387
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:54,220
And it was hilarious because I came up with Ballerina with three legs.

1388
01:16:54,220 --> 01:17:05,140
But I do not support the use of this for the purpose of making a game that you intend to make money on.

1389
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:09,660
If you need art assets, you hire a fucking artist. End of story.

1390
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:18,220
Or you pay for the art that has been submitted to, you know, stock accounts, you know, it's, it's,

1391
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:23,420
well, and on top of that, I will say going back to what Ron Shawn said about artwork with a character with six fingers.

1392
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,980
I mean, we did have the Princess Bride with the man with six fingers on his left hand, just saying.

1393
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:32,420
That and Julian had an extra thumb when he was born.

1394
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:38,140
But anyway, but Valve was basically putting out,

1395
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:46,620
and this is a quote on here, unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has a sufficient rights to the training data.

1396
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:51,820
And that it's also been denying games with AI made text.

1397
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:57,740
So, so there's some people were talking about it being a hoax.

1398
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:03,340
But honestly enough, though, it does bring up.

1399
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:14,140
That. That basically it's something that needs to be a point of discussion.

1400
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:17,260
Yeah, this is coming on top of that.

1401
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:25,020
Yeah, if you are using a third party algorithm.

1402
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:32,380
To generate artwork that you did not make instead of paying somebody.

1403
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,980
Who does this for a living.

1404
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,220
Then.

1405
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:43,580
Yeah, and I went to a comment from in chat from fifth dream saying check my Twitter for my AI art.

1406
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,420
Please tell me where I'm a bad person.

1407
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,780
You're not because you're not trying to pass it off and sell it to somebody else.

1408
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:52,220
That's the difference between what's going on here was you're not trying to pass it off as your own art.

1409
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,620
So somebody else that's the difference should be very transparent.

1410
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,940
I'm fucking around with AI art as dark soccer.

1411
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,980
Just said she did too.

1412
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:59,740
So I played with it.

1413
01:18:59,740 --> 01:18:59,980
Fuck it.

1414
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:00,380
I did.

1415
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:06,220
You know, I sent really funny examples to people and I certainly don't have a problem with.

1416
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,420
Generating it as like an art reference for yourself.

1417
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:19,020
Yeah, number one, you know, I if I can't find a body reference for something that I'm very specifically trying to draw.

1418
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:24,460
Then yeah, I mean using using that as a reference for your own work.

1419
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:29,980
Is one thing, but passing this off as something that you did.

1420
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:40,780
No, passing it off as content for a game that you do not pay for this content and do not have rights to it or the material that supplied it.

1421
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,580
The same, it's not yours.

1422
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,540
Here's the thing.

1423
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,340
It's a cult.

1424
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,220
It's, it's, it's an amalgamation of other people's work.

1425
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,980
So here's the thing.

1426
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,340
So here's the thing.

1427
01:19:53,340 --> 01:20:00,700
I think AI is going to be here in this industry as the concept of machine learning.

1428
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:05,020
You know, cause that's, that's basically, you know, we, we keep calling it AI, but it's based on machine learning.

1429
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:08,780
And I think for me, the big question is how did the machine learn?

1430
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:17,340
Because I think machine learning as a development concept is going to stay here in this industry and it's how the graphics are going to get better.

1431
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:24,460
And how we're going to respond to the 8k and whatever else, 120 frames a second, whatever else becomes, it comes beyond that.

1432
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:28,140
We all know, as it is today, games take a long time to develop.

1433
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,900
And I think machine learning is going to probably accelerate that process.

1434
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,580
But again, it comes back to the question of how did the machine learn?

1435
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:47,260
If the studio developed the machine learning based off their own stuff, their own assets, their own thing to, you know, help them in a, which, which honestly, when it comes to level design, things like that, a lot of studios are already doing.

1436
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,460
Then fine.

1437
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:53,820
They built the technology they're teaching, they're teaching themselves how to do a better bed box.

1438
01:20:53,820 --> 01:21:07,980
But if the machine learning is coming from Reddit, the internet, things that artists who work for money and stuff put out there that then the machine learns from that's where artists are getting pissed off.

1439
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,820
They don't want the machines learning from them.

1440
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,660
And I need to actually define, because clearly people don't seem to actually know what machine learning is.

1441
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,300
Machine learning starts with a database.

1442
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,660
The machine doesn't know anything.

1443
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:25,100
It is completely void and empty.

1444
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:35,820
What you do is you put in existing information that the machine learns from things that it takes from these other sources.

1445
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,060
It is not its own information.

1446
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:47,020
It will try to extrapolate what it has from the information that was provided to it as a source.

1447
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,100
It is not a human brain.

1448
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,100
It does not have talent.

1449
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,380
It does not have education behind it.

1450
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:59,900
It is simply a query for a database with some more complex programming.

1451
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,140
Fan art, since you bring it up, has zero to do with this.

1452
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:10,860
Nor does fan writing because you can, number one, like Marissa just said, you cannot distribute them as your property.

1453
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,780
They are considered works of transformative media.

1454
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:20,940
Meaning that, first of all, they are under copyright protection no matter what Anne Rice has to say about it.

1455
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,980
You cannot make money off of them.

1456
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:34,220
It is put under free use and it does not use the thoughts and actions that come from other people.

1457
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:40,060
You are not copying and pasting out of other people's writing directly from a book.

1458
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:43,100
You are creating this scenario from your own mind.

1459
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,300
That is a different thing.

1460
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:52,460
If you put out, say, computer, use this data to write this fanfic, then that is a different story altogether.

1461
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:59,980
You are completely, you do not understand what you are talking about, Fifth Dream, end of story.

1462
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:04,700
End of story, you do not understand what you are talking about.

1463
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,820
I think that is a little harsh.

1464
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,420
Everybody is welcome to their perspective.

1465
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:14,140
But opinions based on a lack of knowledge are not valid.

1466
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,340
But Fifth Dream says, explain fan art boost at cons.

1467
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:24,940
And I would say that when it comes to the fan art boost at cons, that thing has been a ticking time bomb for a long time.

1468
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:28,380
But that is not the same as stealing someone's art.

1469
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,580
No, it is not.

1470
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,060
This is art in someone's own personal style.

1471
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:40,460
But I am also pointing out, what I am trying to point out is that because that exists does not mean it is like completely, I am like, that is a ticking time bomb.

1472
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:44,940
There is going to come a day when Nintendo or somebody, the problem is,

1473
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,300
no, well, it is not really a problem.

1474
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,780
Because again, I do not think they are a problem.

1475
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:53,900
But what is going to happen someday, nobody wants to be the first company to do it.

1476
01:23:53,900 --> 01:24:00,220
But someday, there is going to be a company, Nintendo, that tries to shut that down.

1477
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:05,740
And in the end, false equivalence like you are bringing up is a fallacious argument.

1478
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,420
It does not qualify as an argument.

1479
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:11,500
All right, I would say let us move on to something else for time.

1480
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,260
Unfortunately, we have another AI story.

1481
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,220
So let us get to it.

1482
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:22,540
Yes, this is going to make it a little bit difficult with the whole not allowing AI art on Steam.

1483
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:29,820
Because Unity is officially embracing AI with a couple new enhancements to Unity.

1484
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,860
So they have now Unity Muse and Unity Centris.

1485
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:40,220
So Unity Muse is a platform of AI capabilities for content creation.

1486
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:47,420
They said with Muse chat for AI based search now in closed beta and AI powered experiences

1487
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:51,180
at Unity runtime is also now in closed beta.

1488
01:24:53,820 --> 01:25:03,660
So based off of like their little sizzle reel that they had, it is generating like images as well.

1489
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:09,420
So from what is a good question, since it has Muse in the title, I assume it is from Muse.

1490
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:14,860
But yeah, Centris, I am not really sure what exactly that is either.

1491
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:19,420
I know some of the complaints I have seen before with some of these is that like, for example,

1492
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,780
you are saying generate this.

1493
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:26,060
It is just pulling down assets like 3D models from the web for different things,

1494
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,420
which is kind of annoying.

1495
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:32,940
But you know, with that, of course, developers are very wary about what Unity is doing right now

1496
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:38,380
and saying, you know, hey, you know, just to jump on the train, what data set y'all pulling the art

1497
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:44,300
from? Unity fully needs to be transparent about what machine learning models will be implemented

1498
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,180
during including the data that they have been trained on.

1499
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,460
How the machine is learning.

1500
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:49,500
There it is.

1501
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,900
Yeah, I didn't even know that that was that was what was coming.

1502
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:52,400
That's perfect.

1503
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:53,980
Yeah, I don't need this.

1504
01:25:53,980 --> 01:26:00,060
I don't see any way machine learning in current iterations can be effective without training

1505
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,940
on countless ill gotten data.

1506
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,580
Really concerning image generation stuff.

1507
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,780
What data sets?

1508
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,940
Hi, what data sets was this train on?

1509
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:12,700
You get the idea like this is the type of stuff that, you know, they're obviously concerned with

1510
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:18,700
because as they should be, because imagine you're a developer and you're you decide to utilize this

1511
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:24,140
in your game, you publish your game, all of a sudden you're getting a copyright claim because

1512
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:30,460
some of the artwork that was in there was not acquired by Unity in a proper way.

1513
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:36,940
Oh, now you have to pull your game off of, you know, steam because or you're in legal

1514
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:42,540
trouble because, oh, yeah, it stole from this artwork to make this thing.

1515
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,660
So that kind of sucks.

1516
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:51,980
Where I would say that this is kind of what I could be useful for is, for example, if

1517
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:57,260
I'm trying to implement something and it's just racking my brain how to code something

1518
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:03,100
in a certain way, yes, AI would be nice to be able to like, say, hey, I want to write

1519
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:09,420
a function that does this and then have it like spit out something for me and then I

1520
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:15,180
could try plugging in and see if that works and or like, hey, can you write a better?

1521
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:20,140
Can you take this code that I wrote and make it more performant or something like that?

1522
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:24,380
Like, that's where I think this would be useful when it comes to AI generating art.

1523
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,780
Yeah, like, I don't know.

1524
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,860
They showed an example like animations like make this character do a backflip.

1525
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,700
OK, but where is it getting that animation information from?

1526
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:39,580
Unless it's they're doing like their own training and stuff on their own sets of material and

1527
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:42,060
their own like capturing and stuff like that.

1528
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,580
I just don't see that happening.

1529
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:47,500
I see them cobbling this together in the cheapest way possible.

1530
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,660
I can say this.

1531
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:54,700
And I think fifth dream is finally starting to get the point with what he just said.

1532
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:57,020
You trained it with your own image.

1533
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,820
That's one thing.

1534
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:58,540
That's your art.

1535
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,180
Now, the thing is, is that I work in tech.

1536
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,380
I can't say where I work.

1537
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:09,580
But when like and like what you were just saying, Loki, with the material being used

1538
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,260
to fit is provide if it's being taken without consent.

1539
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:18,700
Well, what happens if someone walks into your house and runs off with your PlayStation without

1540
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,060
your consent?

1541
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,580
It's called stealing, right?

1542
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:23,820
It's.

1543
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:32,940
If it's with your own material or in the public domain, one thing, if it's taking from something

1544
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:37,500
that other people have put their hard work into, for example, creating those animations

1545
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:41,900
for their own games from scratch and another company is using them to build their machine

1546
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,820
learning tool, that is stealing.

1547
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:48,860
Let me try my very best to put this another way, and then I really want to move on because

1548
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,980
we still have a lot of show to do.

1549
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:53,420
I'm going to try my very best to explain this a different way, and I'm going to use this

1550
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:54,540
show as an example.

1551
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:57,420
So here's to me, here's the difference.

1552
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,300
OK, there's a lot of OLR out there.

1553
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:03,100
There's 966 episodes of OLR.

1554
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:10,060
Hypothetically, somebody could feed all 966 episodes of the show into some one of these

1555
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:16,380
little things, and they would be able to develop their own Orange Lounge Radio as a result,

1556
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:23,340
because they could feed all of this show into a database or, you know, an AI thing, train

1557
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:27,340
it the types of things we say, how we say them, how we respond to things.

1558
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:33,100
Somebody could take this show, put it in one of these and churn out their own Orange Lounge

1559
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:33,500
Radio.

1560
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,980
And if you were to pass that off and then sell it or claim it as your own, to me, that's

1561
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:38,460
stealing.

1562
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:40,700
That absolutely is stealing.

1563
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:46,140
And on top of that, it's not just, if I may, it's not just stealing.

1564
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,220
It's misrepresentation of an entity.

1565
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,260
But I want to make sure the other half of this is clear, because this is the important

1566
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:51,900
distinction to me.

1567
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:57,500
If you've been listening to OLR from the very beginning and you're like, I think this show

1568
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:57,980
is great.

1569
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:58,620
I love you guys.

1570
01:29:58,620 --> 01:29:59,340
And you're here every week.

1571
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,180
To that, I say thank you.

1572
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:02,300
I really do appreciate that.

1573
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:08,220
And you go, you know what, Rob, Jamie, Loki, I'm so inspired by what you guys do.

1574
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:15,020
I want to start my own podcast inspired by you guys, because I just I listen to you and

1575
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,300
I think it's great.

1576
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,900
I want to do my own thing.

1577
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,260
Is that stealing?

1578
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:24,140
No, because you're doing your own thing and we've inspired you.

1579
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:33,900
But at the end of the day, did the machine learn from taking our information and analyzing

1580
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,260
it and spitting it back out?

1581
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:40,300
No, your brain, your human brain listened to it, was inspired by it.

1582
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:44,780
But ultimately, you made the ultimate decision at the end of the day.

1583
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,580
And so you were inspired by the show.

1584
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,740
And that I would say would be okay.

1585
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:58,380
Yes, SheHulk10 says, I'm on Grapefruit Lounge Radio sponsored by Fresca.

1586
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,220
That's the biggest thing is that it gets down into the fundamentals

1587
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:10,940
of where the source is, where the source is, and how it's being used.

1588
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:16,700
And on top of that, then going into the ethical side of how is this going to affect people

1589
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,620
who do this for their living?

1590
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:19,180
All right.

1591
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:21,980
I think we found a sliver of middle ground there.

1592
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,220
So I'm going to take that, run with that, go to the next story.

1593
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:25,500
So let's talk about.

1594
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:30,220
Well, my whole thing is that I just don't think that there was an understanding of the

1595
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,660
fundamentals of the idea.

1596
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:32,160
That's all.

1597
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,800
All right, let's talk about some Atari reveals.

1598
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:42,400
And, you know, because I talked earlier in the show about Atari 50 and what, you know,

1599
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,400
some of the things that they've been doing with that.

1600
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,760
And let's talk about some other things that Atari has in store.

1601
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,320
They're going to be making some games called Quantum Recharge and Haunted House.

1602
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,440
Here's the interesting thing.

1603
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:58,480
Again, there is actually a Haunted House reboot, remaster, whatever in this Atari.

1604
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:03,280
This is yet taking that same IP and making something else out of it.

1605
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:08,240
So, you know, again, if you want to run your own thing through machine learning, that's

1606
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:08,480
fine.

1607
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,320
That's what Atari keeps doing.

1608
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,120
That's fine.

1609
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,640
Okay, bad joke, but I tried.

1610
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:19,280
But Quantum Recharged is, this is going to be similar to Yars Recharge, Gravatar Recharge.

1611
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,280
These are the games that already exist on Steam.

1612
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,040
Quantum Recharged is this.

1613
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,440
Quantum was the 1982 arcade title.

1614
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,160
It's a little bit lesser known, but it is an Atari 50.

1615
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,360
It's a vector based game.

1616
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:35,360
You use a trackball to get dots and shapes, kind of like Kix, but that's very much a,

1617
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,960
yeah, not quite.

1618
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:41,840
And then Haunted House is a reimagining, of course, of the 1981 game Haunted House.

1619
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,160
It looks a little more like a Diablo type of game or a Minecraft dungeons, if you will.

1620
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:51,600
It's a little bit more of a, you know, dungeon crawler, which, if you think about it, are

1621
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,280
kind of rooted in the original Haunted House game, ironically enough.

1622
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:00,720
So I'm not sure how, I feel like, I don't know if a lot of Atari's stuff like this ends

1623
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:04,560
up being very quality when it is a little bit derivative of modern stuff, but we'll

1624
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:04,720
see.

1625
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:08,400
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, because at least they've been hitting and

1626
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,800
missing lately, which is better than only missing, which is where I feel like they were

1627
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,920
at for a long time.

1628
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,360
So I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

1629
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,920
I would like to see how this Haunted House turns out.

1630
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:23,040
Quantum Recharged Haunted House coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Switch, and

1631
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,120
of course, the Atari VCS.

1632
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,240
Yes, that's still a thing in the press release later this year.

1633
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,280
All right.

1634
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,120
Oh, geez.

1635
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,040
With that, since I brought up Atari, a great chance to take a trip down memory lane.

1636
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,400
Therefore, bring on the bump.

1637
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:52,480
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1638
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,800
out a classic and tell you about it.

1639
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,440
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1640
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:05,280
But once a month, Dark Soccer likes to mix it up and pick a non-video game to highlight.

1641
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:10,800
And Dark Soccer, I really think I should just showcase this by playing this little ditty

1642
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,840
for everybody here.

1643
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,960
I think you will agree.

1644
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,560
Yeah, let's start off with that.

1645
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,120
I agree.

1646
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,160
Let's roll the clip here.

1647
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,640
It's some time in the future.

1648
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,040
The ultimate challenge.

1649
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,120
Crossfire.

1650
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:32,960
All right.

1651
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,400
You know what it is, which I swear to God came up on this show not that long ago.

1652
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,000
I was like, Jamie, did you pick a duplicate?

1653
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,520
But no, it's just this game came up in normal conversation.

1654
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,240
I'm pretty sure.

1655
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:51,520
I actually believe that it was this game that inspired me to do this as the segment.

1656
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:57,520
My brothers and I had this, and I can tell you that I almost broke my face open, tripping

1657
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,720
over those little ball bearings.

1658
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,680
I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh at that.

1659
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,840
I just, the way you tell that story is humorous.

1660
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:10,640
My brothers were using them as ammo for whatever they were playing with.

1661
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,280
Oh my gosh.

1662
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,960
Maybe transformers or something.

1663
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,200
Anyway, Crossfire.

1664
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:22,480
It's a game that was created by the Milton Bradley company in 1971.

1665
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,680
This game's older than me.

1666
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:31,120
And basically you have these two pucks.

1667
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:35,920
One of them is sort of spirally and the other one is sort of triangular and you have to

1668
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,680
shoot these little ball bearings at the puck using your little shooting guns.

1669
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:45,360
Until they hit the other side.

1670
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,400
But because the pucks are also on their own ball bearings, they can spin a little bit.

1671
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:56,160
The original version of it had a very flat play field.

1672
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:02,640
And then the later ones were a little bit dome shaped so that the ball bearings on the

1673
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,240
pucks would roll a bit more easily.

1674
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:14,160
But also it could prevent the little balls from, you know, staying on the field and not

1675
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:18,960
being able to be picked up by, you know, the player to refill their little gun.

1676
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:27,200
And then in the 2010s, the re-release just gave it slightly slip to the more shallow

1677
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:32,080
grade that would keep the pucks from sliding on their own as much.

1678
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,240
So they've gone through some revisions.

1679
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,640
So basically the two pucks, like I was saying, they have a ball bearing and they are made

1680
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:44,880
of plastic and the bearing can spin and roll with that plastic so the pucks will spin around

1681
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,960
and move and be more responsive to the hits.

1682
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:56,560
So basically the object is to get either piece to your opponent's goal and the first for

1683
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,840
three goals wins.

1684
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:05,440
So, of course, the thing that most of us remember, not necessarily the 1971 edition, but the

1685
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:12,560
1990s commercial that we just saw, that it was the post-apocalyptic crossfire.

1686
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:24,640
And that, wow, apparently the winner in that exchange, I just read this, was someone named

1687
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,920
Tim Maynard, a Shakespearean actor who went to daytime soap opera acting.

1688
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,520
The more you know.

1689
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:45,760
Anyway, but yeah, the game wasn't as intense as they made it look on the commercial.

1690
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:52,320
Because the problem is that you had to scoop up all the little bearings and put them back

1691
01:37:52,320 --> 01:38:01,600
in your gun, which of course, if you're planning to get somebody with better aim, then they're

1692
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,200
going to take advantage of the slowdown that you have when you're putting the bearings

1693
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,520
in and, you know, send it out.

1694
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:15,200
But yeah, I'm trying to see if I can find a picture of the 1971 version because, oh

1695
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,160
yeah, 1971 crossfire.

1696
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,760
Rob, can I show you this?

1697
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,600
Well, I was going to see if I could YouTube it real quick.

1698
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,480
I just sat back down.

1699
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:22,720
Sorry.

1700
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,560
I snuck AFK to use the potty, but I'll see.

1701
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,520
Yeah, I just found it.

1702
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,880
I just found the YouTube video.

1703
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,380
Okay.

1704
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,340
Yes.

1705
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:32,560
I bet I can probably find it too, but give me a moment here.

1706
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,520
We'll bring it up.

1707
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,240
Yeah.

1708
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,560
Let's look up crossfire 1971.

1709
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,200
But anyway, yeah, it's quite a bit different of a creature.

1710
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,920
It's very plain.

1711
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:48,720
It almost looks kind of like an old air hockey, you know, table, but

1712
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:54,480
the, the game itself, it has been through all those different iterations of it.

1713
01:38:55,120 --> 01:39:00,800
And I can see why they went with this theme when they did in the nineties, cause it is

1714
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:08,240
very nineties, but the one thing that I can't find is what the sales rates were like for

1715
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:08,740
this.

1716
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,360
Let me, let me try one other place.

1717
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,120
Let me try one other place.

1718
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,880
It says actually the average game lasts for 10 minutes.

1719
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:29,760
And yeah, there's, there's no notice on here for, for how well it's sold or anything.

1720
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:30,640
That's a little sad.

1721
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,720
I was hoping to find a little bit more about it.

1722
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:39,840
The 1971 one is way less cool looking, but it's very, very 1970s looking like even just

1723
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,520
like down to the font that's on the table is very like seventies table game.

1724
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,560
Oh, seriously.

1725
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:55,120
And I'm, I'm actually a little bit, a little bit sad that I can't find, you know, what

1726
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:56,640
the sale was like.

1727
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:03,520
I even looked at BoardGameGeek and tried a few other sources, but nah, no one, no one

1728
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,320
says, although you can buy replacement balls for it on Amazon.

1729
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,680
That's convenient.

1730
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:16,320
Yeah, I kind of want one now, but someone has it on, uh, Amazon for 70 bucks and I'm

1731
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,280
not paying 70 bucks for a game they tried to kill me once.

1732
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:22,960
All right.

1733
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,800
Game that tried to kill me.

1734
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,560
Is that, is that it?

1735
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,200
Crossfire.

1736
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:27,440
All right.

1737
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,160
There it is.

1738
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,000
Am I, is that, and the B-roll, are we done?

1739
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,500
Okay.

1740
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,440
There it is.

1741
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:37,040
Your classic non-video game of the month, Crossfire.

1742
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,560
You're living in it.

1743
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:38,960
That's it.

1744
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,640
My next segment for next year is going to be games that tried to kill me.

1745
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,080
Maybe I should, maybe I should just do like, uh, games that make me rage.

1746
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,880
You still have a good seven months or no, not seven, but five months figured out.

1747
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:55,840
So you got time.

1748
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,960
How about all of them?

1749
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,760
All of the above.

1750
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,260
All right.

1751
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:02,960
A random category, classic game category of the month.

1752
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:04,900
All right.

1753
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,960
Let's move on.

1754
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,320
We have some rapid fire news.

1755
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,040
That's one thing that hasn't changed on the show in a very long time.

1756
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,680
We travel around and look at some other headlines real quick.

1757
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,480
Let's start with Loki.

1758
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,640
Apparently, uh, during, during the Annapurna interactive showcase, which happened last

1759
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:28,000
week, um, there was a brand new game from Keita Takahashi that looked, uh, like a brand

1760
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:35,920
new game, uh, called, I guess, T um, it's about a, or it's a, I'm not sure.

1761
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,160
Yeah.

1762
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,840
T I guess is the name of the game.

1763
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:48,080
And it's about a teen that is stuck T posing and trying to fit in to like, I guess a, the

1764
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,640
plastic lifestyle of a quaint seaside town.

1765
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:51,920
It's a 3d puzzle game.

1766
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,640
To a T they call it.

1767
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,880
It looks funny.

1768
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:01,680
I like, I like quirky games like that, so I'm not sure when this is coming out, but

1769
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,920
they know that guy's the one that's going to make quirky games.

1770
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,680
So yeah, absolutely.

1771
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,360
Yeah, no release date yet.

1772
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:13,200
It's coming out though on X-Box one, X-Box series and PC at some point.

1773
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,000
Oh my God.

1774
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,400
X-Box exclusivity.

1775
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,840
They shouldn't be able to buy Activision Blizzard now.

1776
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:26,400
In the game that I would, I'm going to call a crack for Rob.

1777
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:36,560
Uh, we have the unholy abomination of a crossover of hello kitty in a Stardew Valley animal

1778
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,480
crossing style game.

1779
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:45,040
Um, it is called, uh, let's see, hello kitty Island adventure.

1780
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:48,400
I'm sorry for your loss of time, Rob.

1781
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,800
Well, here's the gag.

1782
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:51,200
Hold on.

1783
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:54,320
I'm trying to put the little, um, thing on the other screen.

1784
01:42:54,320 --> 01:43:00,640
I have received several direct messages on a similar notion this week about, uh, oh,

1785
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,840
I see that they have mixed hello kitty with animal crossing.

1786
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,080
Sorry to hear about your life being over.

1787
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,520
Um, it's, it's a mobile game.

1788
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,240
I'm not really interested in playing this on a mobile platform.

1789
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:19,440
Now I've just poured it if this, yeah, if this were on switch or, you know, um, I don't

1790
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,920
know, like a PlayStation or something.

1791
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,080
Yeah, I could see it being dangerous.

1792
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:28,800
But as it stands right now, like I'm not trying to like crap on mobile games.

1793
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,000
I'm just not interested in playing a game like this on a mobile device.

1794
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,400
So that's just where it stands for me.

1795
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,120
So fair enough.

1796
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,400
Um, if someone is interested in playing, it's coming out July 28th on Apple devices.

1797
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,600
All right, let's move on.

1798
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:44,800
Dark soccer.

1799
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:51,840
So, um, there is, uh, well, sad news.

1800
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:57,600
So, um, the music producer, um, Akira complex has died.

1801
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:03,680
Um, it was announced by attack the music, which is an LA based record label that they

1802
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,280
did some albums with.

1803
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:12,000
Um, but a lot of the work that was, uh, done was for dance, dance revolution.

1804
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:17,840
Um, and, uh, apparently it seems to have been suicide.

1805
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:25,280
So, um, so their family and friends sending best wishes.

1806
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:31,680
Um, yeah, they also, of course, I forgot to mention did stuff for sound full text,

1807
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,880
dance, fresh stardom, beat mania, two DX, and a few others.

1808
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:41,760
And apparently I think one of the last, uh, or one of the best known albums was from 2018

1809
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,640
hyper synthetic.

1810
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,240
So, but at any rate, uh, may their memory be a blessing.

1811
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:51,040
And again, thoughts go out to their family.

1812
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,360
Their music is still with us through these games.

1813
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:57,920
And we know these Bahmani games are quite the cult favorites and, you know, the musical

1814
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,520
live on for a long, long time.

1815
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,320
Uh, dark to see us as I do believe one of the guys that hung out with us back in the

1816
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,360
day is that attack the music.

1817
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,240
Now, isn't that, isn't that what Bahmani style kind of turned into?

1818
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,480
Or am I, am I mixing up my record labels?

1819
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,480
I can, it's been a long time, admittedly.

1820
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:16,880
I thought they kind of kind of transitioned from that into doing their own music label

1821
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,920
of that type of music.

1822
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,280
So I could be wrong though.

1823
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,120
Um, it's been a long time.

1824
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,360
Uh, anyway, uh, let's talk about, uh, what's going on on the various consoles as far as

1825
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,280
the subscription programs.

1826
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,280
So, um, Oh, it's Oda quest.

1827
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:31,520
Thank you.

1828
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,400
Dark to see you.

1829
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:32,720
Okay.

1830
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:34,080
So I'm just mixing up my names.

1831
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,280
Apologies.

1832
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,880
There's a lot of y'all to keep track of.

1833
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,680
All right.

1834
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,000
Um, let's talk about what's going on on PlayStation.

1835
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:46,080
PlayStation plus monthly games for July, 2023 include call of duty, black ops, cold war.

1836
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:47,360
Cool.

1837
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:51,280
For some people, I guess, uh, N Ling extinction is forever.

1838
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,400
That's like your cute little indie title.

1839
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,240
And I'm interested in this one for sure.

1840
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,240
Alan Wake remastered.

1841
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:01,920
So not to be confused with the original Alan Wake, this is the actual remastered version

1842
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,320
that came out not a terribly long time ago.

1843
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:08,160
Probably in preparation of Alan Wake two is a good time to do it.

1844
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:15,280
If you're on the Xbox system, you can pick up these on Xbox live games with gold from

1845
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,600
the first to the 31st of July.

1846
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,320
Darkwood is the game that is available.

1847
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:25,200
And then from July 16th to August 15th, cause they, they flip things out, uh, in the middle

1848
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:27,120
of the month as well on Xbox.

1849
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:33,520
When the past was around, this is a love story of Etta and owl, who I do not believe is an

1850
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,800
actual owl, but it is a point and click adventure type of game.

1851
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,360
And supposedly has a really beautiful music with it.

1852
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,320
I'll have to check that out.

1853
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,000
I'm a sucker for a good music score in a game.

1854
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,720
That's for damn sure.

1855
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,920
And Hey, I know usually we just talk about PlayStation plus and Xbox games with gold,

1856
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:54,160
but a new challenger approaches because Nintendo is adding to Nintendo switch online in the

1857
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,160
Sega Genesis expansion packs.

1858
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,480
They have to have the expansion pack, but you have four pretty good games available

1859
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,480
on the Sega Genesis online, uh, that will be available.

1860
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,000
I think is available now.

1861
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,680
I think they came out of this last week.

1862
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,180
Yes.

1863
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,080
Revenge of Shinobi.

1864
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:10,880
Cool.

1865
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,840
Ghouls and ghosts.

1866
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:17,120
Land Stalker and Crusader of senti are all out.

1867
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:22,800
If you have expansion pass, excuse me, expansion pack for a Nintendo switch online, which I

1868
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,560
still don't, but one of these days I'll probably break down and get it.

1869
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,160
All right.

1870
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:32,240
If none of those recent releases are good enough for you, let's talk about some recent

1871
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:36,320
recent releases as we travel around the world and check out some release dates starting

1872
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,920
in the U S for games this week.

1873
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,040
Loki and not a lot this week, unfortunately.

1874
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:47,120
Uh, so we've got a game called scarf coming out on PlayStation four, PlayStation five,

1875
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:56,000
Xbox one and Xbox series, sentimental death loop on Nintendo switch and legends of heroes

1876
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:02,720
trails into reverie on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

1877
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,220
That's it.

1878
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:04,900
All right.

1879
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,760
Let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases on the Nintendo switch.

1880
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:15,520
You know, it's almost as if somebody in Japan heard my complaints about hello kitty island

1881
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,560
adventure, because look at what they're releasing on the Nintendo switch this week.

1882
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:24,800
Pretty princess magical garden island is one release you can look forward to this week.

1883
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:30,720
And in this game, you get money and gratitude points for doing requests for the island

1884
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,600
residents.

1885
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,600
And you can personalize, you'll create the farm of your dreams all while being a pretty

1886
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,200
princess at the same time.

1887
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,120
And, and there is a bunny.

1888
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,640
I'm just going to say that there's a bunny.

1889
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:41,860
All right.

1890
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,280
If that's not good enough for you, guess what?

1891
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:52,800
You've got little friends, puppy Island also available this week.

1892
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,080
It's kind of like Nintendogs, but they don't make that game anymore.

1893
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,720
So somebody else decided to do their own spin on it.

1894
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:04,080
And they took the Nintendogs on holiday where you can build the ultimate puppy paradise.

1895
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,920
I have some friends that would take that to mean an entirely different thing, but we're

1896
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,000
not going to go there on this program tonight.

1897
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:15,600
If neither of those games are up your alley, perhaps trouble, which is final episode one

1898
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,280
daughters of amlogram, uh, will, uh, be up your alley.

1899
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,040
That is also available in Japan this week on the Nintendo switch.

1900
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:30,000
Let's take a look real quick at the PlayStation five, just one release, but it's F1 2023.

1901
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:37,120
So if you want to get your race on in Japan, you can do that with F1 2023 from EA out of

1902
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,040
Japan this week, dark Sakura.

1903
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:39,680
How about the UK?

1904
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:44,800
Um, uh, one thing on the fourth, um,

1905
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,600
um, I don't know why, but you cut out all of a sudden we just heard the,

1906
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,520
Oh, that was a weird blip.

1907
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:53,920
I'm sorry.

1908
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,760
We just had an audio blip and all we heard was on the fourth and then it cut out.

1909
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,260
Okay.

1910
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:06,160
So on the fourth, um, X, uh, versus ATV legends on PlayStation and Xbox.

1911
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,600
And it's not a holiday over there.

1912
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,160
So whatever.

1913
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:14,880
Well, after a certain quarter of nine last week, I don't think we're having a holiday.

1914
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:17,520
This year's holiday is canceled as far as I'm concerned over here.

1915
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,400
So, but I will be still taking the day off for it.

1916
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,280
All right.

1917
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:25,600
Well, I mean, I'm already off anyway, so I guess I get paid on it.

1918
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,560
I will be celebrating the art of napping that day.

1919
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:34,880
I will be celebrating it not being a fucking hundred plus degrees that day.

1920
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,240
That too.

1921
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:36,720
You're here.

1922
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,280
You're here.

1923
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:38,640
All right.

1924
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:46,400
We have a few more headlines for you, and then we will get to listen around table, but first Loki.

1925
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:47,760
Yeah.

1926
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,560
So one of the, uh, popular games of the moment is only up.

1927
01:50:52,560 --> 01:51:00,880
It is kind of long lines of the, um, Bennett Foddy games where they're incredibly stressful,

1928
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,400
hard platformers.

1929
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:02,800
Oh God.

1930
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,960
It's been pulled from steam.

1931
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:10,400
And the reason for that is because there was artwork featured in the game from a 3d artist

1932
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,840
who had that available to purchase.

1933
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:19,520
However, it was for non-commercial use and they used it for commercial purposes.

1934
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:27,200
So now, um, they have to work that out, I guess, until the game, you know, is, um, available

1935
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,800
or, you know, I guess they could patch it and remove that piece of artwork or something.

1936
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,600
Maybe, I don't know.

1937
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:37,280
It's it is a platformer game where you have to jump a bunch of, uh, models or jump on

1938
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,640
a bunch of models of things.

1939
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:45,200
So I have never heard of this game somehow in my, and yet I follow gaming.

1940
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,360
Um, it's a popular streamer game.

1941
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:47,760
Yeah.

1942
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,400
I I'm looking, I just pulled it up to see what this is about.

1943
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,480
It looks, I guess, pretty.

1944
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:58,480
Usually these indie darlings that really take off on Twitch have kind of like retro graphics.

1945
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:01,280
So I'm looking at this one going, Oh, this one actually looks kind of nice.

1946
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,400
So it's like kind of a bunch of assets kind of thrown together.

1947
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:10,560
Um, but you know, um, about it though, like the other thing, this is also had some controversy

1948
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:18,720
with it as well, because originally the game, um, had some sort of NFT promotion, but then

1949
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:24,400
of course there was rules against a tease on steam as well as selling, um, if you're

1950
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,680
selling and buying them in game rather than simply promoting with them.

1951
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:32,320
So I guess, I don't know, it it's been kind of a mix.

1952
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:33,840
The game itself looks okay.

1953
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,800
There's been people that have been watching that have been trying to speed run it, but

1954
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,720
um, yeah, I'm curious to see whether that's going to happen now that it's been pulled

1955
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,360
from steam.

1956
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,720
I think you can still play it though.

1957
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,240
If you have it, I'd assume.

1958
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:45,680
Oh yeah.

1959
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,200
They, they can't like take that from you once you bought it.

1960
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,000
So I think it's part of the agreement you have with steam.

1961
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,800
So, um, interesting.

1962
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,520
Yeah.

1963
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,400
Um, but, uh, it's, it's, uh, yeah.

1964
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:04,240
Usually these games that kind of take off on steam are not, do you think it's a Phoenix?

1965
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:07,040
It's a only up is the name of the game.

1966
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:07,280
Yeah.

1967
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,080
It's, it's kind of like a getting over it type game.

1968
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,400
So, yeah, I would say Twitch.

1969
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,360
I might've said steam, but it's cause I was looking at the headlines, but I meant like

1970
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,000
Twitch.

1971
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,640
It's interesting how, you know, games can really be made on Twitch.

1972
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:24,640
Meaning like, you know, I look at a game like vampire survivors is kind of a recent

1973
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:29,600
example where it caught a lot of, you know, headwind on Twitch and more and more people

1974
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,240
played it.

1975
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:34,320
But of course, I think just, even if you want to go way back, hell Minecraft in a, in a

1976
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:39,280
way it was, you know, hugely made popular because of Twitch among us, obviously another

1977
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,320
example of that in the game we brought up on the show tonight, five nights at Freddy's,

1978
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:45,600
I think to some extent, maybe a little more YouTube on that one, but still, you know,

1979
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:47,200
content and creators.

1980
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:55,360
Um, it's, it's very interesting to me how much Twitch can really kind of elevate a game

1981
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,440
to such a huge level of success like that.

1982
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,440
Yeah.

1983
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,000
Yeah.

1984
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,960
And it's fascinating.

1985
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,160
Anyway.

1986
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:02,480
All right.

1987
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,600
Let's move on.

1988
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,440
I think Jamie stepped AFK.

1989
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,080
So look, you do want to go to the next story you had and we'll go back to hers.

1990
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,120
Yeah.

1991
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:09,680
Sounds good.

1992
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:16,800
So this is funny because actually this is a little bit more of a local story, if you

1993
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,300
will.

1994
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:26,880
So, um, Dave's retro games in, out of Sacramento, California, um, down at the Folsom flea market.

1995
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,120
I think it's Folsom flea market is what they call it.

1996
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,080
It is.

1997
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:33,200
Cause when I first saw this story, I was like, Oh, is it out of denial?

1998
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,360
And I was like, Oh, it's at that place.

1999
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,280
Well, I think I've been there.

2000
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,720
I've been there once.

2001
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:38,880
Yeah.

2002
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,320
I've been in this one too.

2003
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,240
I actually, uh, not that long ago.

2004
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:45,440
And I would never go there on a day like today because that whole place is hot.

2005
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:46,880
Balls.

2006
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,160
It was, yeah, it was hot when it was like 80 degrees down there.

2007
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:51,600
So like, yeah, absolutely.

2008
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,400
No way.

2009
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,920
Um, but yeah, they, he's had the store for 35 years.

2010
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:02,720
Funny enough, back when I was in my previous role, a previous job, I actually almost was

2011
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:07,040
selling to this guy, except he, he wanted to buy used product and we didn't really have

2012
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:07,600
any of that.

2013
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:13,520
And when it came to game stuff, but my coworker dealt with him on a direct basis for selling

2014
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,000
used VHS tapes at this time.

2015
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:20,560
But yeah, so he is trying to get out of the business.

2016
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:27,360
He has posted his business up on Craigslist and looking for a buyer for $1 million.

2017
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:36,000
Says he has about 35 years and 20,000 games there and looking to sell everything with

2018
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,500
it.

2019
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,680
That's one, one way to get rid of your inventory.

2020
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:40,820
Yeah.

2021
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,120
Here's the problem though.

2022
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,120
This is the rub here.

2023
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:49,600
And they did a little piece I saw on like good day, Sacramento as well, talking about

2024
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:50,080
it and stuff.

2025
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:54,320
He was showing off like some of the products they had like talking about like video game

2026
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:54,820
collecting.

2027
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:59,200
The fact that he has that kind of inventory isn't necessarily notable.

2028
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:00,960
It's what condition it is in.

2029
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:07,360
And as a personal, my personal experience with his inventory, it's trash.

2030
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,800
It is garbage.

2031
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:16,160
It is in such a disarray, disorganized mess with like the quality of like loose games

2032
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,440
and the labels falling off.

2033
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,920
And so I remember when we went there, I was looking for specific like NES games and good

2034
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:25,760
luck finding them because there is no organization to it whatsoever.

2035
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,640
Just all out of all sorts of order, just stacked on top of each other, like behind a glass

2036
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:31,200
case.

2037
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:34,400
He's got a few box games, but like he was showing, it's like, Oh yeah, Pokemon.

2038
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,960
This one's, this is a sealed copy of Pokemon.

2039
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:40,800
It's worth a lot of money, but you look at the box and the box is just smashed the hell.

2040
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,480
Like it's just he is delusional if he's thinking he's going to get a million dollars for this

2041
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:47,520
is what I'm saying.

2042
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,080
Yeah, like good luck.

2043
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:54,160
But like I was not of like particularly impressed when I went there.

2044
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:56,160
Just there was nothing there for me.

2045
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:59,760
Granted, it was years ago, you know, and I don't know what's changed because it was before

2046
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,640
the pandemic for sure.

2047
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,960
And probably even like 2017 was right when I was there.

2048
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,000
It was a long time ago.

2049
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,400
Yeah, well, we went not that long ago.

2050
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,160
It was probably about a year or two ago.

2051
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:11,040
So like, it was not in good shape.

2052
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,600
Like I know there was another guy that was at denial.

2053
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,320
Oh, that guy.

2054
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,440
Maybe the same.

2055
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:15,760
Yeah.

2056
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,680
I was wondering if you'd been to this play star, Zara.

2057
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,320
Oh, of course.

2058
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:23,440
Do you remember Trader Dan?

2059
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:26,080
That was the one that's in denial.

2060
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,120
Yeah, that's him.

2061
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:28,320
Okay.

2062
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,080
Yeah, this guy's at Folsom.

2063
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,680
No, this guy's at the Folsom market.

2064
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:31,920
Yeah.

2065
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:32,880
Okay.

2066
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:33,360
Okay.

2067
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:41,600
Yeah, because, I mean, we used to go to when Trader Dan was in the, I can't remember the

2068
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:44,800
community now, but we used to go out there.

2069
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:48,560
But yeah, anyway, God crazy.

2070
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:49,060
Yeah.

2071
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,160
All right.

2072
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:52,240
Well, let's go Dark Soccer.

2073
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:56,480
You were going to talk about, since we're talking about retro games, an interesting

2074
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:57,280
rerelease, right?

2075
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:58,480
Yeah.

2076
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:03,280
Although, I mean, it's hard for me to think of one of these as obscure because I've

2077
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:04,560
had a copy forever.

2078
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:16,160
But Retrobit is doing two rereleases for Sega Genesis slash Mega Drive.

2079
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,080
Pre-orders are up.

2080
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:27,120
But one of them is Syldis, which we had for Sega CD a Sylfis with an F.

2081
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:35,760
But it was released in 1990 for the Sharp X68000, also as Sylfis.

2082
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,600
The game is a fun shooter.

2083
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,440
It has really beautiful artwork on it.

2084
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,400
So it's a horizontal shooter by Wolf Team.

2085
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:50,080
I have not done it as a classic game yet, but maybe I will.

2086
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:55,360
And then the other one is El Viento, which is a side scrolling action game that came

2087
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,080
out in 1991, also by Wolf Team.

2088
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,880
And it had a female protagonist.

2089
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:07,200
It is definitely that 90s anime style, you know, dirty pair Cutie Honey looking.

2090
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,120
I mean, like later Cutie Honey, not like 70s Cutie Honey.

2091
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:11,680
But anyway.

2092
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:18,320
But yeah, they're coming with the slipcover, clamshell case, cartridge, the manual.

2093
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:28,720
And each of these are open to order from now to July 30th for $54.99 US and to ship out Q4.

2094
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,380
All right.

2095
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,160
Listen up, collectors.

2096
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:38,080
Although if you're a true collector, you already have it, right?

2097
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:45,120
If you're an even truer collection, you have the X68000 and you've got the original discs.

2098
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:49,600
Uh, Dartitsia in chat says, I remember Soul Feast on Sega CD.

2099
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:52,800
Not as familiar with El Viento, but it seems like a fun action platformer.

2100
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:54,160
Soul Feast was fun, though.

2101
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:58,320
Wouldn't top Gradius in the shmup department, but more shmups aren't a bad thing.

2102
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,480
It wasn't a bad game at all.

2103
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,440
It was in a saturated market, I will admit.

2104
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:07,680
Questmaster says, I wish they'd also reissue Ernest Evans.

2105
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:13,440
So lots of, uh, lots of old school releases.

2106
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,400
I'm still waiting for the Guardian Legend to be remade.

2107
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,640
That's, that's, that's it.

2108
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:24,080
Once, once somebody finally remakes the Guardian Legend, I've hit all I want in game.

2109
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:24,580
What?

2110
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:25,600
That I couldn't think of.

2111
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,720
We're playing Gaiden.

2112
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,480
Oh, really?

2113
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:29,360
Play the Japanese one.

2114
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:29,860
Oh, fun.

2115
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,840
The game couldn't get past the first level.

2116
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:34,240
Don't tell him I said so.

2117
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,200
You just ratted him out.

2118
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:35,700
All right.

2119
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,920
I don't know if I could anymore, to be honest.

2120
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:40,000
It's been forever since I really sat down and played that game.

2121
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,960
I should do that on stream.

2122
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:46,320
And I did it with a, on a, um, on a delay on the, the big TV in the front room.

2123
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:50,800
Dr. C says, I did pitch TGL to the folks at Bitwave.

2124
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:51,920
So cross your fingers.

2125
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:56,320
Who the, well, we, we went down this rabbit hole of who owns the rights anymore.

2126
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:56,720
Right.

2127
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:01,440
So it's just when somebody wants to make it, they'll make it, they'll pony up the money.

2128
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:01,940
Anyway.

2129
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,160
Uh, let's talk about one more.

2130
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:08,560
So earlier we were talking a little bit about how like a game can be made or broken.

2131
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:09,520
Well, not broken.

2132
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,560
I was just saying a game can be made and bolstered up by Twitch.

2133
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:18,480
I have never heard of a game not making it because of its Twitch performance, but this

2134
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,600
is a very interesting thing.

2135
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:23,040
It's crash team rumble is the game we're going to talk about.

2136
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:27,520
And there's some headlines going around about how it's struggling on Twitch.

2137
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:33,200
Uh, a website video gamer has noted that the total number of Twitch users watching crash

2138
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:36,560
team rumble has sunk pretty low.

2139
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:42,880
It's only down to like double figures, meaning like 40 people on all of Twitch watching this

2140
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:49,920
game, even though, uh, it was like 12,000 at its peak, the average is somewhere a little

2141
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,800
more in like the 300 type of range now.

2142
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:58,720
Um, that's not great, but that also probably has to do with the fact that the game really

2143
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,720
didn't review very well.

2144
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:06,640
Um, also, uh, like to put it in perspective, aliens, dark descent, which was an RTS game

2145
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:12,480
that was released the same day as crash team rumble has about an average of 4,600 viewers

2146
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:13,840
over the last week.

2147
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:18,160
Uh, and at the same time, it was noted that 40 people were playing crash team rumble about

2148
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:24,640
2,200 were playing alien stark descent, uh, F1 23, which was also released, uh, at least

2149
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:31,520
here anyway, uh, 4,700 final fantasy 16, 50,000, which isn't very surprising to hear

2150
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,560
about that at all.

2151
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:37,760
Um, but of course, crash team rumble, it's got a Metacritic score of 68.

2152
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:39,920
Why do we care about how it's doing on Twitch?

2153
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:44,560
Because the game play and crash team rumble is all about online multiplayer.

2154
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,320
Unlike final fantasy 16, as some of those other games, they don't rely on multiplayer

2155
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,280
crash team rumble.

2156
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:55,760
It is that so attracting an online viewership that can help bolster the game anyway.

2157
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:02,880
Um, so it's, um, it's struggling a little bit to get noticed and break through, which

2158
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:10,400
means, Hmm, I wonder if, uh, it will be around much longer if it doesn't start to perform

2159
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,040
better.

2160
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:15,280
So I don't know what it's going to need, but I have to be honest, releasing the same week

2161
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:18,480
as final fantasy 16 for me, not a good idea.

2162
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:22,880
There was no way this game was going to hit my radar with that game out, but I also realized

2163
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:26,320
not everybody's me, but it doesn't seem like, unfortunately, unless you're one of those

2164
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:29,760
40 people, the game is really registering on your radar either.

2165
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,680
Oh, all right.

2166
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:36,160
And with that, that was the last scheduled story we had for tonight.

2167
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:38,000
I do want to open up the listener round table.

2168
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,520
If you have any, um, questions, comments, concerns, uh, or calls, you can always go

2169
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,760
to our discord and speak with us through the week.

2170
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:48,000
vognetwork.com slash discord.

2171
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,320
And if you want to give us a call tonight, just join the green room channel, which is

2172
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:56,960
over there, uh, under the, uh, uh, general channels.

2173
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:58,560
No, just kidding.

2174
02:03:58,560 --> 02:03:59,280
I don't know what I'm talking about.

2175
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:00,320
It's in the network show channels.

2176
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:01,120
You'll see the green room.

2177
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:06,400
You join that and you can, uh, be waiting to call in vognetwork.com slash discord.

2178
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:09,200
Um, a few things.

2179
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:12,640
I actually have a last minute headline tonight because I forgot to read it earlier in the

2180
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:17,360
show when I was talking about BlizzCon, but I wanted to mention this is coming.

2181
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:24,880
World of Warcraft classic hardcore is about to be officially embraced by Blizzard, meaning

2182
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,200
death equals delete.

2183
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:28,880
That's what hardcore is to be fair.

2184
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,600
Hardcore is a thing that exists in Diablo.

2185
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:37,360
So the concept of existing in World of Warcraft as well is not exactly farfetched considering

2186
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:41,120
some feel that World of Warcraft plays more like Diablo than it does the original Warcraft,

2187
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,080
to be quite honest.

2188
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:43,920
But, uh, I digress.

2189
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,920
World of Warcraft classic hardcore is going to be officially implementing this concept,

2190
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:54,080
which means if you die, you don't get to go to a ghost and go back to life.

2191
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:57,360
You cannot be resurrected with ancestral spirit.

2192
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:01,520
You can also not use the warlock soul soul stone.

2193
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:06,000
So I don't know, like this is like those moves kind of exist for those, but anyway,

2194
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,520
that's how they're drawing the rules.

2195
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,120
That's going to be very hard.

2196
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:15,440
Um, your character will not disappear when they die, but they will be a ghost.

2197
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,440
So you can stay in touch with your guild mates.

2198
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:21,200
You can literally haunt your guild mates as a ghost.

2199
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,960
But you can also, uh, what's interesting about this too.

2200
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:28,720
You can do free transfers to non hardcore servers.

2201
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,320
I like that a lot.

2202
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:33,440
So if you are playing hardcore and you get really attached to the character and then

2203
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:36,240
your character dies like randomly, cause that's always the way it goes.

2204
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,760
It's like, Oh fuck, a lag spike.

2205
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:38,240
I'm dead.

2206
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:42,800
You can actually move that character to a non hardcore server and continue it.

2207
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:43,520
That's cool.

2208
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:44,960
Um, I like that.

2209
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,080
That's very similar to what path of exile does with their hardcore mode.

2210
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:51,360
Um, anyway, there will be other restrictions.

2211
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:56,160
Um, not available in regular world of Warcraft.

2212
02:05:56,160 --> 02:06:01,200
You cannot kite a monster from one area to another to try to get it to attack low level

2213
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:01,760
characters.

2214
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:02,800
Good.

2215
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:08,960
You cannot deliberately flag yourself for PVP before you can attack another player.

2216
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:12,400
So they're trying to, um, stop that from happening.

2217
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,400
Also, they're annoying shit back in the day.

2218
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:19,280
They're also going to be de-emphasizing PVP in classic hardcore altogether.

2219
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:24,160
You cannot queue for battlegrounds, but there will be a dueling mechanic.

2220
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,520
If you're feeling so bold.

2221
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,680
If you slay an opposing player, you get a cosmetic buff called string of ears.

2222
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,360
They tracks the number of players that you have successfully tracked down.

2223
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,080
That sounds very, uh, like the clown.

2224
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:38,400
Yeah.

2225
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,560
Very with his finger team.

2226
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:41,700
Anyway.

2227
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,720
Or the Teramisu cake with all the fingers around it.

2228
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:45,220
Anyway.

2229
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:46,800
Someone made one.

2230
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,400
I saw that it was wild.

2231
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:51,280
If you want to test that it is on the PTRs now.

2232
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:52,720
So that could be very interesting.

2233
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:56,960
Break Man in chat says haunting your friends sounds fun for about five seconds.

2234
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:57,460
Yeah.

2235
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,400
I don't know.

2236
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:02,000
I've played hardcore in Diablo and it's fine.

2237
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,720
I'm not at the mercy of other players, but of course, World of Warcraft, I just would

2238
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,320
never turn on PVP mode.

2239
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:07,840
That sounds completely uninteresting to me.

2240
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:13,440
But I have done hardcore runs in Diablo and it is a little, I find that I play the game

2241
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:14,800
much more conservatively.

2242
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,720
Like I do not push difficulty.

2243
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:21,680
I stay on baby and I just grind, grind, grind, grind, grind to get to like max level.

2244
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:24,240
Cause at some point I'm going to do it in Diablo four.

2245
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:27,040
I'm probably just waiting for seasonal play to do it.

2246
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:30,080
It makes a little more sense to me to do a hardcore character then, because I think

2247
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:32,800
it'll be high risk, high reward in seasonal play.

2248
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:35,120
So I'll try it then.

2249
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:38,160
But I don't think, I think we're getting the date for the first season next week.

2250
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:42,320
It'll probably, it's, I can tell you when that first season is going to start.

2251
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,880
It's going to start the last weekend in July.

2252
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,800
How do I know it's going to start that weekend?

2253
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,240
I'm going out of town.

2254
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,920
That's why it's going to start that weekend.

2255
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:54,240
You know what, Rob?

2256
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:54,880
What's that?

2257
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:58,080
I kind of miss us playing like wow together back in the day.

2258
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,280
I miss wow too.

2259
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:04,000
I miss your character, Rebecca black, especially when she was, she headlined pride here in

2260
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,920
SAC a few weeks ago.

2261
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,920
I was telling people about Rebecca black.

2262
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:09,680
And her new music is pretty dope.

2263
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:10,240
Actually.

2264
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:12,080
She's in her mid twenties now, believe it.

2265
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:16,640
It's like, I was reading a story on the John and Kate plus eight kids.

2266
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,800
You know, those kids are 19.

2267
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:19,520
They're adults.

2268
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,040
Yeah.

2269
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:24,560
God, when did, when did, when did age happen?

2270
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:28,720
Anyway, um, every day, every second.

2271
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:32,640
I, by the way, I had a birthday this last week and I forgot to talk about that.

2272
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:34,640
I did a birthday stream because there's some birthdays.

2273
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:37,360
There's some, I actually played some, a few things.

2274
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,840
I played, um, no man's sky as well.

2275
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:45,040
The first, um, I hadn't played the new expedition in that game and I cleared the first set on

2276
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:45,360
stream.

2277
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:47,120
It took me like maybe two hours.

2278
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:48,320
I kind of rotated games.

2279
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:51,680
I did like, I think I did theater them for two hours.

2280
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:52,080
I did.

2281
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:53,280
I did it by daylight at the end.

2282
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,200
Cause Alan came on and play with me for two hours.

2283
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:57,440
Um, play with me too.

2284
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:59,280
We had such shit killers.

2285
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,440
This event is bringing out the worst in people.

2286
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,240
It's so wild.

2287
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:05,600
Well, it's actually been 50 50 for me kind of.

2288
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:07,840
Either they're like, that night was not fun.

2289
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:14,320
Either they're the ultimate in sweat or they're like really cool and want to farm because

2290
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,920
Hey, five cakes.

2291
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:16,160
Yeah.

2292
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:16,640
You know?

2293
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:16,880
Yeah.

2294
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,400
That's what I miss.

2295
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:25,440
I miss in these events when the killer would just be standing in the middle, hitting the

2296
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:30,080
palette over and over again or whatever, hitting an object in the train to, to signal that

2297
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:32,320
like, come get hit, come get hit by the killer.

2298
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:32,880
Let's farm.

2299
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,160
I haven't seen a single one of those.

2300
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:40,160
This whole, we've had, we've had a few off and on, um, mostly it's been like, like we'll

2301
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:42,720
every so often, like I've had a fun Sadako.

2302
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:46,960
Like the thing is, is that one thing to remember is that I play with Shayla.

2303
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:48,320
Oh yeah.

2304
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:49,440
Who is the killer whisperer?

2305
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:50,000
That's true.

2306
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,800
Chaela is the killer watch.

2307
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:53,040
Yeah.

2308
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:58,560
Although I'm, I'm not bad at it, but, but like, I, and, and actually I think I got one

2309
02:09:58,560 --> 02:09:59,680
person who knows me.

2310
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:04,640
So actually I did, it was somebody who was on my friends list.

2311
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:12,960
It was, uh, uh, like, uh, Meg loves Anna and I was playing my Meg and they were playing

2312
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,760
the huntress and I was the chosen Meg.

2313
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,000
Not a single hit.

2314
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,960
And then when I realized it was my friend after I was like, Oh my God, it was my friend.

2315
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:23,920
That was cool.

2316
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:26,160
That's only ever happened to me once.

2317
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,200
It wasn't the killer though.

2318
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,240
It was another survivor.

2319
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,120
I queued up.

2320
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,640
It was probably about a year ago.

2321
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:36,400
I went into solo queue and I had Kate with one perk because I was trying to level Kate

2322
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:37,360
Denson for whatever reason.

2323
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:38,480
I was just trying to prestige.

2324
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:42,400
And of course who, who, who ends up in my lobby has lands.

2325
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,520
Now how the fuck am I, was I in the same?

2326
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:50,240
I guess that's how, you know, I was like MMR is broken.

2327
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:52,240
Cause there's no way I should be in the same survivor.

2328
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:53,520
MMR has lands.

2329
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:54,400
Absolutely not.

2330
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:59,920
Unless he had some sweaty killers back to back to back that like dropped him significantly.

2331
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:00,960
But that made me giggle.

2332
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,440
I was like, Oh, that's fucking random.

2333
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:07,120
So yeah, I've had cam in my lobby before his killer.

2334
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:08,800
That's wild.

2335
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:08,960
Yeah.

2336
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:10,880
And I've had a few other people.

2337
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:11,680
I've seen that happen.

2338
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:15,280
Like I've seen people playing and then, um, they go actually.

2339
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:18,640
Was it has playing once when losing color was the, I mean, that's, this shows you how

2340
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,280
long ago it was.

2341
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:22,240
Cause losing color has been a little bit in the retirement home for a little bit from

2342
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:25,920
DVD, but, uh, they were the killer for one of the games just randomly.

2343
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:26,480
I want to say.

2344
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:33,920
I, I still was always like, I always wanted to get LC as nurse and I, and every nurse

2345
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,040
game I'd be like, what are they wearing?

2346
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,960
Is it combo nurse with the Rose thing?

2347
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,800
So yeah.

2348
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:41,300
Yeah.

2349
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:44,000
Anyway, uh, let's see.

2350
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,040
Uh, I wanted to check in on any other final thoughts.

2351
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:49,040
I have a question for, for folks.

2352
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:51,840
If, uh, nobody's gonna drop any in chat, but, uh,

2353
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,440
Yeah, we didn't get an email.

2354
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:56,400
Loki, did you have any, uh, participate at orange on traded.com.

2355
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:00,400
If you want to send an email, but I'm going to caution again.

2356
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,760
I am at that fate again.

2357
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,320
Here we are.

2358
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,120
Here we are friends again.

2359
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:06,960
I'm asking you to donate $20.

2360
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:07,600
I'm so angry.

2361
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:08,160
No, I'm just kidding.

2362
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:13,200
Let me pictures of your cats, but we have an empty mailbag and when we have an empty

2363
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:17,200
mailbag for six weeks in a row, I start to go, should we have a mailbag segment?

2364
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:18,080
So anyway, yes.

2365
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:19,140
All right.

2366
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:24,960
It's the communicate with orange lounge segment, whether it's, so it's all encompassing.

2367
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,320
I know we send me pictures of your animals.

2368
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:33,040
Uh, Loki, do you have any, uh, last minute stories before we, uh, think about wrapping

2369
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:33,540
it up?

2370
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:40,560
Um, yeah, based off of, uh, a job listing posted by EA, it is rumored that the next

2371
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:46,640
Sims entry will be free to play, which makes sense because they already monetize it.

2372
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:48,160
Like it's a free to play game anyways.

2373
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:51,920
It just wouldn't be charging upfront costs anyways for it, which is kind of what they're

2374
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:56,160
doing now with Sims four anyways, because the base game is free to play and they probably

2375
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:57,840
have success with that.

2376
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,160
But yeah, it's, it's already microtransaction that, you know, the wazoos.

2377
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:03,920
So why not?

2378
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:08,800
I can't, it'll be a big marketing thing for them.

2379
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:09,360
It's free.

2380
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:10,420
Yeah.

2381
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,080
I can see them doing that.

2382
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:13,840
Absolutely free asterisks.

2383
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:15,940
So.

2384
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:22,240
Randomly this week, I had to get the tire on my car replay or patched basically, because

2385
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:27,760
unfortunately, um, I ran over not one, but two nails somehow, or they were placed in

2386
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:31,440
my tire, but I don't know how that happens, but anyway, luckily it was patchable.

2387
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:35,120
And the cool thing is a lot of tired, like they'll just do it for free because they want

2388
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:35,760
your business.

2389
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:40,480
And I went to the place I always go to anyway, but here's the thing across the street.

2390
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,080
From the place was a Walmart.

2391
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:45,280
I don't usually go into Walmarts, but I'd had time to kill.

2392
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:47,760
So I went in and you know what Walmart sells.

2393
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,600
They sell arcade one up machines.

2394
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:53,440
And you know, when I look at another one, when I look, no, I did not buy another one.

2395
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:58,320
But when I look behind me here, you're going to notice I have this, I have one machine,

2396
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:04,560
two machine, and they have this interesting blank space before we get to the third or

2397
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,400
before, excuse me, before I get to the couch.

2398
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:10,240
So I have this perfectly sized space for a third machine.

2399
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:17,440
And I will say I saw a Ms. Pac-Man arcade one up that connects to the internet.

2400
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:19,120
It's like a newer version of it.

2401
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:22,480
And it has all the cool Namco games like Mappy and shit connects to the internet.

2402
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:25,360
But I got to say that one looked really good and I was tempted by that one.

2403
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:29,760
But then I saw like three down from it was a mortal combat one that's new.

2404
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:31,520
And it's the first three mortal combat games.

2405
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:32,480
But here's the thing.

2406
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:38,000
A lot of the arcade one up machines also include libraries of games from the same publisher.

2407
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:44,800
And that means it has the Midway classics like bubbles, joust, robotron, like that machine

2408
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,240
is fucking stacked.

2409
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:49,840
And it's Wi Fi compatible now in the new one.

2410
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:56,400
And so I texted Alan a picture and I said, Alan, tell me not to do it.

2411
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,160
And he just basically replied to lol.

2412
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:04,160
The only reason I didn't get it was because at that point, two reasons.

2413
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:08,240
One, I knew that I may have to get my tire replaced.

2414
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:10,000
And that would have cost me $150.

2415
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,520
That's like half a machine right there.

2416
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,200
So I was like, I better not spend the money until I know if I need a tire or not.

2417
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:19,520
And my husband and I went out for a belated birthday dinner.

2418
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,520
We went out to a Brazilian steakhouse.

2419
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:23,200
There's a new one in Roseville.

2420
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:23,920
That's where we went.

2421
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,480
Some chain that just showed up in Roseville.

2422
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,160
We went there and it was fine.

2423
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:32,720
But because I had a cocktail and a dessert because it's my birthday.

2424
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:36,160
It was, you know, those Brazilian steakhouses, $200.

2425
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,600
So that was my fancy birthday dinner.

2426
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:43,680
And that was pretty much the cost of a machine.

2427
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:45,360
So that stopped me from doing it.

2428
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:49,520
But I guess my question to everybody is, should I have pulled?

2429
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,880
Should I have got the damn machine?

2430
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:52,180
Sure.

2431
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:53,460
Yeah.

2432
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:56,000
I think you still still should do it.

2433
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:56,640
I might.

2434
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,120
I might.

2435
02:15:57,120 --> 02:16:02,400
We're not the ink is not dry on that decision yet.

2436
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:02,960
So we'll see.

2437
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:07,440
And then bring it to my house.

2438
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:08,640
And then bring it to your house.

2439
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:12,160
You don't have any arcade one ups in your house, do you?

2440
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:14,480
Because you only have the real things.

2441
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:15,600
I have my two little ones.

2442
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:18,160
Not like the size that you have.

2443
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:19,440
Yeah, you have the little table.

2444
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,560
Actually, I love those.

2445
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:21,280
The tabletops.

2446
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:24,560
I have yet to see one again since I saw him at Target a few years ago.

2447
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:31,200
Well, actually, if we talk, I might be interested in selling my Dig Dug.

2448
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:32,240
Okay.

2449
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:33,760
Work because I like Dig Dug.

2450
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:34,260
Okay.

2451
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,160
It's a Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2.

2452
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,720
Yeah, I have another one that's got Dig Dug on it.

2453
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:42,240
So I didn't realize when I got it, but we already had Dig Dug.

2454
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:42,560
Okay.

2455
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:42,800
Yeah.

2456
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:43,920
And Dig Dug 2 is not.

2457
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:46,800
But it's a dedicated Dig Dug.

2458
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,360
I'm actually pretty good at Dig Dug.

2459
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:53,040
I don't mean to talk my game up, but I'm pretty good at Dig Dug.

2460
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:53,760
All right.

2461
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,320
We'll talk.

2462
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:58,240
I got it pretty inexpensive when I got it.

2463
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:00,720
And we'll talk.

2464
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:03,280
SSG100Matt says Costco sells the tabletop ones.

2465
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:04,320
Like only on their website.

2466
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:08,080
Allen goes to the store every month and is always looking.

2467
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:12,320
In fact, he saw an arcade one up at Costco once and was fucking teasing me with it.

2468
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:15,760
It was a super Pac-Man with wood paneling.

2469
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:16,260
What?

2470
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:17,680
Yeah, at Costco.

2471
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:21,200
This is, unfortunately, this was, I think, the year the pandemic started.

2472
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,160
I think it was 2020.

2473
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:27,120
And I was like, no, don't buy it because I don't know.

2474
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,840
And now I've never seen an arcade one up there since.

2475
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:31,040
And it was a super Pac-Man.

2476
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:35,280
If only I had a baby Pac-Man.

2477
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:36,960
I know, right?

2478
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:37,440
Me too.

2479
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,240
Me too.

2480
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:42,240
I didn't even see one at Golden State, by the way.

2481
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:45,200
They had the Got Lied Pac-Man.

2482
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,360
They did not have a baby Pac-Man.

2483
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:50,640
And I was beside myself for all of five seconds.

2484
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:55,680
But I would love, I would love the tabletops because the tabletops will fit in my closet

2485
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:56,240
much better.

2486
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:57,600
Unfortunately, I was going to move.

2487
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:01,040
The BurgerTime will fit in my closet.

2488
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:02,880
The Tron will not.

2489
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:05,440
You can see on stream, and I apologize to the podcast listeners.

2490
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,720
You can see there's a height difference between Tron and BurgerTime.

2491
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:10,960
And the closet is like right here.

2492
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:13,280
So Tron wouldn't fit, but BurgerTime would.

2493
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:17,760
But I've already had to talk to Allen about, I have a problem.

2494
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:19,520
What happens if I get more of these machines?

2495
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:22,240
But we might, if we had to, we might move them into our bedroom.

2496
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:24,640
We have a wall in our bedroom that's not being used for anything.

2497
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,160
It's just like empty.

2498
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,680
So I'd probably move it in there.

2499
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:30,640
All right.

2500
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:33,440
Well, with that, I think we're going to move and wrap up the show.

2501
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:36,160
But thank you as always for tuning in and listening to our show tonight.

2502
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,040
We appreciate it.

2503
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,680
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Songs Radio, please tell a friend.

2504
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:42,720
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2505
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:44,560
But we need more voices to put out here on air.

2506
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:45,600
Tell a friend or two.

2507
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:49,360
A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is you found this

2508
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,360
awful long way.

2509
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:51,840
Guess what?

2510
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:55,440
You won't find it on, I mean, you couldn't find it on Stitcher anyway, but guess what?

2511
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:56,480
Stitcher's going under.

2512
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:02,240
So sorry to everybody out there who used Stitcher, but our show hasn't been on it for years because

2513
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:06,480
when I told them they needed to update our show, they said it was our problem.

2514
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:10,080
And I pointed out that every other podcatcher out there didn't have a problem.

2515
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:13,760
And they still said, I said, pull the feed.

2516
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:17,120
I'm not going to have people emailing going, why haven't you updated the show in six weeks?

2517
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,000
Pull the feed.

2518
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,400
So we haven't been on Stitcher in a long time.

2519
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:24,560
So I'm sorry to those that use that, but as far as far as I'm concerned, it's a win

2520
02:19:24,560 --> 02:19:27,360
because we were not compatible with that platform.

2521
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:30,080
Anyway, to be fair, it was under a prior owner.

2522
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:31,840
It was not under their current owners.

2523
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:35,120
So I have, but you know, when you burn a bridge, it's hard to build back.

2524
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:36,160
All right.

2525
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:39,280
Anyway, I didn't mean to end on the name.

2526
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:42,800
I say when, when bridges get burned, just shove people off the end.

2527
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:45,920
Yeah, well, that's, well, that's kind of what happened here.

2528
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:46,160
All right.

2529
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:49,840
Anyway, uh, that is, uh, that is it.

2530
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,760
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2531
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:52,240
Dark soccer.

2532
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,120
Your final thoughts tonight.

2533
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:59,920
I am feeling kind of, uh, ill, but I am dedicated to breaking ankles tonight.

2534
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:02,240
So we'll see what happens.

2535
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:03,200
All right.

2536
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,080
Have fun.

2537
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:06,400
Oh, also I have, um, an interview for a position.

2538
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,320
So everyone wish me luck luck.

2539
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,720
Good luck later.

2540
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:10,960
Later.

2541
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:11,520
My taters.

2542
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:12,880
All right.

2543
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:14,240
Logie we're over to you.

2544
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:14,960
Your final thought.

2545
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:21,920
Um, my final thought is hopefully look forward to a new episode of my Minecraft series this

2546
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:22,160
week.

2547
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:23,680
Nice.

2548
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:29,520
Um, my final thought is I have two more days off work and I'd really love to beat final

2549
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:30,960
fantasy 16.

2550
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:34,800
I off stream caught up on all my side quests, so I'm ready.

2551
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:38,800
I'm hoping we don't have, um, too much further to go, but we'll see.

2552
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,960
Actually, but at the same time, it's like, I kind of don't want it to end.

2553
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:42,080
It's really good.

2554
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:45,600
Um, but yeah, I'm hoping maybe in the next couple of days I will finally beat Final Fantasy

2555
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,000
16 and then I can, uh, surf the internet.

2556
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,640
Uh, spoiler worry concern.

2557
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:54,400
I feel like I've hit most of the big spoilers at this point, but we'll see.

2558
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,480
I mean, there's, there could always be more to come.

2559
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:59,920
So, um, yeah, I'm looking forward to beating Final Fantasy 16.

2560
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:01,200
That's it.

2565
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:16,000
And even though I know it is July 2nd and Pride Month is now over because of some things

2566
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:21,440
that happened in this country last week, I am extending Pride Month by one more week.

2567
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:21,920
Deal with it.

2568
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,240
