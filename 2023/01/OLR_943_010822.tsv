0	29240	Happy New Year, January 8th, Rob, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,
29720	35440	Loki. I slept too long. I slept too long.
41120	58920	It's okay, Jason, we weren't here last week. Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. And we are live once again with episode number 943 of our show.
58920	87000	For January the 8th of 2023. See, Jason just kept waking up every single day hearing that they were doing another vote in the house and thinking it was Groundhog Day all over again. That's what was going on with the intro there. Anyway. Hi, I'm Rob Roberts. And I'm here with you for our first show of our 21st broadcast year from 2002 to 2023. I am Rob Roberts and joining me is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hey, how is your 2023 so far?
89360	89960	Rainy.
90000	96080	Yeah, yeah. We'll talk more about that in a moment. But please say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
96680	97080	Hello.
97120	98160	Hi, Loki. How are you?
98720	100240	I'm fine. Tired as usual.
100240	101480	Yeah. Me too.
101480	105440	Well, it's medication now. Well, I mean, it has been medication for a while.
105480	109480	Oh, okay. Well, I hope you are. I hope the medication is helping more than it's-
109480	111480	Oh, yeah, it's it's it's just it makes me tired.
111520	112040	Yeah, I got you.
112840	141920	And hello to our chatters because we do tape live of course every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network. Six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We do tape our show live. We're here every week. We weren't here last week. We were originally planning to be here January 1. But then just kind of a domino effect started happening. I mean, we did a show on December 25 for heaven's sake. So we got we gave you something during the holiday. But yeah, New Year's Day just didn't end up
141920	167200	working out. I had been in a show the night before and then the power went out for quite some time that night. The storms you're hearing about in Sacramento, which, yeah, I mean, like if you go to like USA Today, you're gonna see they have a story about half a million people in Sacramento were without power last night. And I think all three of us were among them at some point or another. So yeah, we're living all that right now. And it's pretty it's pretty pretty gnarly.
167200	197040	I didn't think the storms were that bad. But I can I, you know, I'm also very, very biased about that. Yeah. Um, I, I can, it's it's the kind of of rain that a Californian wouldn't be ready for. Right. And it's even though it's happened before, and they should be ready. It's the whole Well, hopefully, the whole reason why we have the weir is to, you know, redirect the waters so that hopefully downtown doesn't flood. Some folks in chat,
197200	223840	as Joe and her mat says, I heard about bad flooding and sack as well. Yeah, it's it's really sad, but it is the more rural parts of town. The way to the south end and without doxing ourselves live on air. I will just say, Jamie lives on the south end, but not that far south. I live on the north end. And Loki lives like East ish in the middle. So none of us are near that area that's flooding, but not to minimize the horrible stuff
223840	250960	on a hill. So yeah, it's never going to be a problem. They just trees falling. Yeah, that was it. And then last night after the power went out, our trash can fell over. So I had to go out last night, but it wasn't raining, though. It was just super windy. It was kind of creepy because it was like super bright outside, even though there was no electricity anywhere. It was just that like the clouds, you know, and everything kept the light in. But yeah, it was a little creepy. But
250960	280920	flooding, it's been more towards like the rivers and stuff. And like some of these creaks have swelled quite a bit where it's like gone over the road and everything. Yeah. So and unfortunately, that rural south area is very likely to flood again tonight. So So our show should stay on air through tonight, because the next part of the bomb cyclone or whatever you want to call I'm sorry, we're talking about personal stuff. But it does it does kind of impact the show because like I would say last week in part impact show. Yeah, last week in part, I really wasn't feeling it.
280960	303960	Because the night before had been really rough for the storm. Loki had a personal engagement. Dark Soccer and I were both just kind of like, man, at that point. So we're just like, let's just we earned a week off. So we took the week off. I'm sure nobody's it was like, let's call the whole thing. Yeah, pretty much. I'm sure nobody's, you know, upset or anything. But it's just one of those. That's how it happened. So now we're here tonight. But yeah, I had had my procedure before that.
303960	310040	I that's right. And I was I was a little like, Oh, you sure you want to do the show? Like, yeah, so
311440	321060	yeah, on the 25th. I had started preparing for it, which was fine. But then I don't know, I was just like, I don't want to I don't want to exist.
321080	333840	Well, and then that's the other thing. So So keep in mind, last week, we didn't do a show because it was storming. And then it stormed again in the middle of the week. And then it stormed again last night. And now it's gonna storm again tonight. Like that's that's the problem we're having right now is
333840	346360	that we're not, you know, and again, to toss it back to a comment Dark Soccer said earlier about how we're not used to it. We're also because we're not used to it. We're not built for it. That's, that's, that's the huge problem is that, you know, although they they have taken many
346360	359840	precautions and in parts of town that are prone to flooding, like I was talking about with the weir earlier and stuff to redirect the the water to the causeway and stuff. You know, it's just, it's, it's, it's a lot. It's a lot of rain back to back to back.
360480	389660	I remember moving out here and seeing all these buildings like are made of plywood is their base. I'm like, where's your rebar? Where's the you know, where are your your concrete bases where you know, and I was just like, man, if if the weather even sneezes, this place is gonna fall over. I wouldn't go out on the balcony of the apartment building
389660	393340	because it was made of wood. Yeah. But I mean, when I first moved out here,
393380	407100	but at the same time, if an Earth if a major earthquake happened in the middle of Boston, a major earthquake, none of my having a middle Boston, the city would topple over and I hope it never does. I'm not you know, but I'm just saying the architecture is different. You're prepared for different climate sorts of things.
407100	422340	Exactly. It's the same thing that people like, Oh, Alabama gets hurricanes. Why don't you people move? I'm like, Los Angeles gets earthquakes. Why don't you people move? It's something it's Northern California gets set on fire regularly. Why don't you move?
422340	432260	The only town that's perfect 100% of the time is San Diego. I swear it's like nothing ever seems to happen in San Diego. That's the only place in America.
432260	433220	They've had some shakes.
433220	437180	Yeah, I guess I guess. But literally, they probably have the best track record.
437220	444060	Yeah. And they also have extraordinary desserts. So I think that, yeah, I think that that makes them extra special.
444060	473940	Yeah. And I see other folks lighting up in chat, of course, like Tiger Claw saying Florida gets hurricanes. Oh, yeah, they do. Pop Culture says we get tornadoes. Yeah. So keep in mind, you know, we were gusting 70 miles an hour. And for you hurricane pros, that's nothing. I know. But again, for us, that's how to start. I'm not I kid you not. One of the one of the neighbors solar panels was on the ground today. That's what kind of wind it was last night. And you know how well everything's built for that. So it's just pretty
473980	476580	wild. Pretty wild. Anyway, go ahead.
476860	488580	It's actually literally to go back to your point, though. I mean, it is a matter of of what you're used to in what the area that you're in is going to be prepared to accommodate, you know. So
489580	501780	that's right. And and very, very good point from Bobby Black Wolf. We're used to it, but it doesn't make it any less scary. Oh, God, like those noises I was hearing last night. I was like, Did my roof just blow off? Because it sounds like my roof just blow off. And of course, I walked outside of my okay, it's fine.
502500	505700	Now, for me, though, those sounds were comforting.
507260	522900	Because I know, I would always have my best sleep during a heavy storm. And at my old house that I grew up in, we had a metal awning that was right outside of my
522900	531780	my, my bedroom. And so wind and rain would hit it and it would, you know, and it would actually put me to sleep.
531780	549540	Yeah, actually, our old old house that I grew up in, in the older part of Roseville, where I grew up for those that know the area, we had like a patio that was built attached to the house. So like we had a smaller backyard because my parents had an outdoor or like an indoor patio built and added to the house. But the
549620	566980	what when the water would hit that during the rainstorm, because the material was made out of it would make a lot of noise. And it was it was actually pretty comforting until that house actually flooded one year. And that's why some of the stuff gives me a little PTSD. It didn't get past the garage, but it got real close. And like all of our neighbors were affected.
566980	589140	I do have to say I have a very vivid memory of being four years old during Hurricane Frederick, which was a cat for hurricane. And me keeping trying to go out and watch the windows and seeing an eight really old oak tree up route in front of my house. Thus, this oak tree was probably as wide around as a minivans on its side.
589620	618740	And that's like if you drive through downtown Midtown, Sacramento right now, that's like every other corner. It's it's unreal. So and it just the only thing that sucks is it would be one thing if it's like, well, we got a week of sunlight to clean up Nope, another three inches of rain tomorrow. And I know there's pictures everywhere out there. Again, I'm sorry to make this about the weather. But again, this is what we're dealing with. I'll get to games in a minute. You see a lot of pictures of the weather out there or the the bridge. I think that the the
618740	648300	Tower Bridge, you see a lot of that in the waters running really high, right? Like right next to Old Town, Sacramento. And like people are like, and I see things on Tick Tock where people are like Sacramento's fucked. Look at how high that river is. And there's another three inches rain coming. But the good quote unquote news is what they're neglecting is that there's a whole bypass system that's built that they haven't even activated yet. But it's getting close. So what happens is that they they open this thing called the weir and it diverts the Sacramento River into the Yolo Causeway, which is a rural land
648300	665420	between Sacramento and Davis, California, where the university is you've probably heard of. And it just it floods that whole area, but it's all rice land and stuff that can resist flooding. So I don't know why they don't open it up sooner. But that's the quote unquote good news is so that my house doesn't flood. That thing exists.
665620	669260	I'll tell you what area I'm worried about. Israel, Linda.
670060	676820	Yeah, well, yeah, that's the place that flooded in the 90s. For sure. And then the same the same area that flooded on New Year's Eve.
677060	690940	The construction over in this area will in the area outside of that basically created a floodplain where there wasn't one. So more human involvement changing ecosystems.
691020	719860	Oh, boy. All right. Well, speaking of the future, I'm actually surprised no one has pointed this out yet. But maybe because I've done a personal stream and some folks maybe saw this hanging out and I was just on Bobby show and we were talking about it. But let me mention here on on Orange Launch Radio, especially for the podcast listeners. Behind me as we tape live tonight, I now not only have a Burger Time arcade one up machine, but I now have a bigger brother, a Tron arcade machine is next to it.
720100	739140	And that was what I built. Pretty much right. I think it was just about ready to go. Oh, no, I was building that instead of doing OLR on New Year's Day. Like, while I was listening to Bobby, I was actually building the machine. So I was working on that most of the most of the night on Sunday. So but you see, it's all set up now.
739940	768860	I do really enjoy the machine. Long story short, it I did not realize that is and you could actually probably see it right towards the top of the marquee is this is actually a black light in the machine. And I realized it actually replicated that I thought because the way other time I've seen this machine was a Bobby's house, and he has external black lights. So I thought that's why I was seeing the black light effect, but the machine actually hasn't built into it, which I thought was pretty cool. And that's why everything inside it kind of glows a little more than maybe what you're used to.
768860	798460	But it's a really cool effect. It's a really nice presenting machine. I mean, if as long as you can get over the fact there's only two games in it, but Tron is great. Disks of Tron, I'd maybe played one other time. And so getting to play that a lot more has been pretty cool. So yeah, so long story short, I am enjoying the machine. And that's why you see that behind me now on the feed. And that was my Christmas present from Alan, who got it half off on a Black Friday sale. That's kind of why it was like, because you know, the machine was really
798460	827940	expensive when it first came out, but half off. That's pretty good deal. So Bobby says I need your arcade one up username so I can add you. Sure. It's just Rob Roberts. I'll one word, Rob Roberts. If you do add me, make sure I have your username, of course, Bobby Black Wolf, but any other folks out there who happen to have a Tron cabinet, I'm happy to add you to the gallery here. Because this is the newer, BurgerTime doesn't do this. BurgerTime was right at the tail end before these machines started getting online on the internet, and now they have online leaderboards.
828140	857460	But that is literally the only thing this thing does is online leaderboards. It does it. It's not like multiplayer online or anything else. It's just the leaderboards. I believe like there's a Mortal Kombat release that they put out not long ago rerelease that you can play it online. I hear it doesn't run very well. But that's I haven't experienced it firsthand. I don't know. But yeah, you can do online leaderboards. But basically what you're doing is you're creating a filter saying I want to see these people.
857660	886740	And it'll filter for those people. Bobby Black Wolf says NBA Jam was the first online one. Well, then that's, that's not too surprising. It went to Mortal Kombat as well, because those were all Midway games back in the day. And I think Warner has licensed all that now. So they're probably, you know, they the arcade one up has put out a lot of Namco, a lot of Capcom and a lot of Warner at this point. So, but it's cool that they got this Disney one. So you know, looking forward to see what else they do. You know, they did they did get The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle, they have old Konami games.
886740	916700	There's a lot of people, myself included, that would love to see a Konami classic classic Konami classic cab with stuff like time pilot, gyrus, Contra, heck haunted castle, if we could go there, although that that game is hard as fuck a haunted castle, of course became Castlevania if you didn't already know, but the original haunted cancel cap. Why can't I talk to me? The original haunted castle is fucking hard. It is it is disgustingly difficult game, but I would love to see like
916700	946660	a, oh, Dr. Seuss says they did Frogger. I didn't even realize that. But yeah, I would love to see the Frogger. Of course they did Frogger. But like a time pilot and gyrus and all that would be great. Bobby says last week, one of my AMA questions was what would your ultimate arcade one up be? And I actually said they should make a home beat mania machine, put sound vortex on it, whatever. I would love to see that too. But unfortunately, they're not going to do it. It'll tell you why they're going to be competing against themselves with 2DX Infinitas and some of the online offerings they're doing so they're not going to want to do that.
946700	965780	But yes, dreamboat answers, of course, build the online version into that cabinet to play it and then people would pay their subscription. Nobody is smart enough to think of that Loki. Let me give you the ideas Konami since you don't have them yourself. Also, I think there was a cabinet with time pilot pilot in it. I bet it was the Frogger cabinet.
965780	995740	And maybe I need to take a second look at that cabinet. I probably just laughed it off because it was Frogger. But I love Tom pilot. It has gyrus too. I mean, let me check. But I would I would love a DDR replica cab. I mean, I don't I they could make assault, they could make it a solo machine. They could literally sell like a solo machine as an arcade one up type of thing. But anyway, that's a discussion for another day. Let's get into our official kickoff topic tonight. I know we've been talking literally about the weather and that sort of thing. But let's get into it.
995780	1018820	But I do want to get into some other topics, including since we didn't end up doing a show on New Year's Day, we haven't had an opportunity to look back at the best of 2022. And look forward to our official predictions for 2023. Which, admittedly, we've been slacking on the predictions a little bit ever since we went virtual and the pandemic and all that stuff. We're going to bring them back this year and actually do some predictions.
1018820	1033900	So looking back on to 2022, I want to kind of go around and see, what were your favorite games of the year? And maybe any additional highlights you want to share with the crowd? Loki, I'll pick on you first.
1033900	1056900	My favorite games of the year, I didn't play a whole lot, obviously. So really, my highlights probably going to be Goat Simulator 3. I think that was a great sequel. It's still rode that balance of really broken and yet polished. A lot more polished than it was before. And I still need to go back and play it somewhere because they have been doing regular updates to it.
1056900	1071900	So it's really going to hit its stride once it hits Steam because it's one of those Epic Store exclusives. And that'll be when all the modding support comes in. I'll buy it again, of course. The other game, of course, that's been fun to play this year is Power Washing Sim.
1071900	1086900	So Power Washing Simulator is just really fun and relaxing to play through. And I'm glad that they keep adding stuff to it as well. And of course, Minecraft. But you know, you've heard me talk to death about Minecraft. What can I really say?
1086900	1088900	It's still going and that's worth noting.
1116900	1128900	And it's like, okay, what is it, though? Well, you know, it's, it's, it's about creativity and making the world your own and telling stories. And like, that's what that's what Minecraft is already.
1128900	1158900	Well, we can't want to make a roblox. Like, what are they? Well, no, I mean, they don't want to make a roblox. I think they're going to try to like, stuff that you can build more lore into or something like that, things you can interpret. It's a bunch of excuses that they don't want to just share what they're doing. Because if they don't get it done, people get upset with like the 4k graphics pack. Well, well, yeah, that too. But no, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're
1158900	1188900	they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're,
1188900	1191580	and you're like, oh, wild, all done.
1191580	1195020	It's like, but that's the only one by him.
1195020	1196100	He said you were going back in
1196100	1198580	and like revitalizing all of them
1198580	1201580	and making them feel more lively and you didn't do that.
1201580	1204060	So obviously people were disappointed,
1204060	1206940	but they're like, no, no, no, we never promised anything.
1206940	1208540	We just showed you concept art.
1208540	1209440	And then now they're like, well,
1209440	1210600	we can't show you concept art
1210600	1212060	because then you're going to think it's coming.
1212060	1213720	It's like little babies,
1213720	1215920	like their marketing team is just awful
1215920	1218420	when it comes to just communicating stuff.
1218860	1220460	And now they just don't, they just have shut down
1220460	1222540	and we're just not going to tell you anything then
1222540	1224180	because then you're just going to get your hopes up.
1224180	1227320	It sounds like, I don't know.
1228180	1230220	It sounds like a bad parent, actually.
1230220	1232740	Like I can see, like if you're a bad parent
1232740	1234360	trying to like, well, I'm fine, Billy.
1234360	1235500	I'm not going to promise you anything
1235500	1237740	because then I'll just disappoint you.
1237740	1241020	So I don't know.
1241020	1243400	That wouldn't be the first time I've heard that excuse.
1243400	1246160	It's just like, it's stupid is what it is.
1246160	1248920	So now we have like no idea when the update's coming,
1248920	1250020	what the update is.
1250020	1252400	It's like, they're not showing anything, which is fine.
1252400	1253460	Like you can do that.
1253460	1254920	Like when they did another update,
1254920	1258280	which is probably the best one that they've done,
1258280	1260120	it was like in 2020.
1260120	1263760	And what they did with that is like, they just said,
1263760	1266080	okay, all of a sudden, boom, here's everything.
1266080	1268320	And everyone's like, whoa, this is really cool.
1268320	1269520	And yeah, you know what?
1269520	1272280	There were things that they showed off in that probably
1272280	1274880	that were implemented in the game.
1274880	1275980	And that's fine.
1276740	1277580	People understand.
1277580	1278860	But if you just like say,
1278860	1280700	if you promise like all this stuff
1280700	1283620	and then give you something that's like 10% of that,
1283620	1284980	plus something that was like,
1284980	1287220	should have been in there updates ago,
1287220	1289580	because that's what you promised.
1289580	1292500	YYR puts it perfectly in chat who says,
1292500	1295060	never ever promise the kids the broccoli farm,
1295060	1298260	unless you're certain you can deliver the broccoli farm.
1298260	1299660	Exactly, exactly.
1299660	1301900	Like it's just, and it's fine.
1301900	1304820	Like people are reasonable and they'll understand.
1304860	1306660	I mean, some people are unreasonable,
1306660	1309740	but like the majority of people are reasonable enough
1309740	1312120	to know that like, okay, I get it.
1312120	1314700	Like you couldn't, there's the pandemic.
1314700	1317300	Yes, I understand that there was the pandemic
1317300	1318140	and all that stuff.
1318140	1321580	And this update that you're talking about was really big.
1321580	1324800	And so you couldn't get it done in the timeframe
1324800	1327060	that you wanted, because it was a lot more complex
1327060	1329860	than you initially thought, which is also once again,
1329860	1332980	a stupid idea to promise something that quick a turnaround
1332980	1335340	when you don't even know the scope of it yet.
1337180	1340580	So then like, that's understandable.
1340580	1344700	But that was two years, now three years ago, okay.
1344700	1346340	Pandemic's been over for a while.
1346340	1347820	People have gone back to work.
1347820	1349100	It's not.
1349100	1352700	I understand it, but like they are now,
1352700	1353620	they can't use the excuse,
1353620	1355280	well, we're just not used to working remote.
1355280	1357820	Okay, it's been three years that you've been working remote.
1357820	1359100	You're used to it now.
1359100	1362140	Okay, so I don't wanna hear excuses about like,
1362180	1365420	oh, well, it's the pandemic is why we couldn't do it.
1365420	1367080	No, it's because your poor planning
1367080	1368000	is why you couldn't do it.
1368000	1368840	And that's fine.
1368840	1369980	Lower your scope down,
1369980	1373060	make it clear and understandable what's coming.
1373060	1375460	Perhaps don't start a third game.
1375460	1376300	There you go.
1376300	1378300	Like they're making Minecraft Legends right now,
1378300	1380340	which is another game that like,
1380340	1383100	the more I see of it, the less interested in it I am.
1383100	1385820	They have Minecraft Legends, Dungeons, and now this.
1387340	1390380	It's just, if your resources are spread so thin,
1390380	1392900	then don't do that.
1392900	1394980	Lower your scope down.
1394980	1396100	Whatever, we'll just,
1396100	1398200	we just have to wait for them to tell us what it is.
1398200	1400700	I'm sure in the summer or something will come out.
1401660	1403060	Yay.
1403060	1404680	All right.
1404680	1407220	Dark Sakura, looking back on 2022,
1407220	1408980	what were some highlights for you?
1410540	1411700	Dead by Daylight?
1413060	1414400	Cause it had new chapters.
1415480	1418020	Except I hate Wesker and I hate the night.
1419020	1422460	Now for new games, I actually played,
1422460	1424180	I played all the way through Cult of the Lamb,
1424180	1426100	which I had such a fun time playing.
1426100	1429420	That game is messed up and so fun and cute.
1429420	1432380	And also I started playing Marvel Midnight Suns.
1432380	1437260	I played on my Monday stream and I really liked that game.
1437260	1442260	I can't wait until we get more people into the group
1442920	1446180	and they do some really good stuff about the group dynamics
1446180	1447540	for the people that were already there
1447980	1449220	versus the Avengers joining up.
1449220	1451500	And now I have Spider-Man in there
1451500	1452900	and he's absolutely perfect.
1452900	1455880	And I'm having a really good time with the game.
1457940	1459140	Good.
1459140	1462180	Yeah, that's all I have to say about that.
1462180	1467180	I mean, I haven't really had many other things come out
1468220	1471040	that super interested me, you know,
1471040	1473140	but those two were the big ones.
1474220	1476100	Quest Buster in chat says, yay, Midnight Suns.
1476100	1478060	I finally finished my campaign a few days ago.
1478060	1478940	So good.
1478940	1480040	You know, in the Marvel department,
1480040	1483460	I hear a lot of people really hyping up Marvel Snap.
1483460	1484300	Is that what it's called?
1484300	1485140	Yeah, there's people who are into it.
1485140	1486740	It's not my kind of thing.
1486740	1488300	Gotcha, I just see a lot of people on,
1488300	1489980	especially Mastodon where I'm at now
1489980	1492220	has got a few people I follow in there
1492220	1494400	that are super into Marvel Snap and hyping that up.
1494400	1497200	So it's like the Marvel license is thriving
1497200	1498080	in gaming right now.
1498080	1500180	That's certainly something to take away from 2022.
1500180	1501880	That's for sure.
1501880	1504600	Okay, so let's talk about my game of the year.
1504600	1505660	So I'm gonna pick something.
1506180	1509060	I actually don't think this one is too like outside the box
1509060	1511140	or too like against the grain,
1511140	1513540	but this is what I consider the game of the year to be.
1513540	1515540	And I know a lot of people, you know,
1515540	1517660	think it's God of War, Ragnarok, which is fine,
1517660	1519460	which is, or Elden Ring, which is fine.
1519460	1521320	Admittedly, I haven't really sat down
1521320	1523060	and spent a lot of time with either of those games
1523060	1526340	in part because I still don't have a PlayStation 5,
1526340	1528380	although it sounds like maybe I can finally get one soon.
1528380	1529820	We'll see.
1529820	1532920	But just also in part that, again,
1532920	1535460	the genre that Elden Ring is located in
1536220	1538320	has not yet still convinced me to join it.
1538320	1540400	And maybe that's, you know, my own hardheadedness.
1540400	1541540	I don't know.
1541540	1543140	But I actually would make an argument
1543140	1545020	that there was another game that came out
1545020	1548280	that I actually think did something so well,
1548280	1550700	it supersedes both those games in my,
1550700	1553940	I could tell you, I could play both of those games
1553940	1555300	thinking, just going into them,
1555300	1556740	knowing they're probably 10 out of 10 games.
1556740	1559220	And there's still another game I would probably say
1559220	1562380	would truly represent the game of the year.
1562380	1567380	And some people are probably gonna say I'm incorrect
1567940	1570260	because this game technically launched
1570260	1572820	in like December of 2021,
1572820	1574340	but it didn't launch launch
1574340	1576140	until the middle of the year this year,
1576140	1577780	or more a little late in the year.
1577780	1580940	So I think most people probably discovered it this year.
1580940	1583500	And I think some of you probably are figuring it out.
1583500	1586020	And I will say, I think the game of the year
1586020	1590020	is the bargain basement, appropriately priced,
1590020	1595020	way underpriced game that provides so many hours of value
1595340	1599820	that created a whole new genre.
1599820	1601820	And that game is Vampire Survivors.
1601820	1604420	I think that is the best game in 2022.
1604420	1606340	I wouldn't say that's a new genre.
1606340	1607940	Oh, oh, the Survivor genre.
1607940	1609500	Look at all of the knockoffs.
1609500	1614320	I mean, I get that it's rooted in a roguelike.
1614320	1617940	So that's probably where your feelings come from.
1617940	1618780	I'm gathering some-
1619260	1620900	Stuff like Smash TV.
1622380	1626460	Yeah, but Smash TV and the way the power-ups branched
1626460	1628020	and the way you work through the game.
1628020	1632380	I mean, I think what it did very well
1632380	1636180	is it merged all these concepts together.
1636180	1638940	It's kind of like it created something new
1638940	1641660	by taking the very best from all these other tapestries.
1641660	1644940	And not only did it do it, like it did it so,
1645780	1647020	like it's a small,
1647020	1649420	it's only one or two people that made that game,
1649420	1651140	super duper on the cheap.
1651140	1655700	And look at the news about how they pretty much
1655700	1659380	were forced their hand to put that on mobile devices
1659380	1662180	because everybody started ripping it off.
1662180	1665940	And even now I start to see all these ads on TikTok
1665940	1667780	or whatever I'm watching that are basically
1667780	1669940	rip the Survivor something.
1669940	1671660	Survivor this, Survivor that.
1671660	1673620	And we're not talking about the TV show.
1673620	1675660	We're not talking about a Destiny's Child song.
1675700	1676860	We're talking about this trend
1676860	1678420	that Vampire Survivor started.
1679820	1681940	And now we have games like Soul Stone Survivors
1681940	1683580	that I think are also very good
1683580	1687140	that kind of take that idea of the progression
1687140	1689060	and the randomness of a roguelike
1689060	1691140	with the action of a Smash TV
1691140	1693820	or a twin stick shooter, basically.
1693820	1696620	Because some might say that like Returnal
1696620	1698220	also does this very well.
1698220	1700700	But I think Vampire Survivors,
1700700	1702620	especially when you consider how much it costs
1702700	1705660	and how prolific it got is why I would say
1705660	1707220	that was probably the best game of the year.
1707220	1709060	In my opinion, it's my opinion.
1709060	1713020	So looking in chat, Dartusia says,
1713020	1715500	oh yeah, Vampire Survivors is at least top three.
1715500	1718660	I just bought Super Smash TV on Super Nintendo.
1718660	1722420	Michi said she remembered playing it, so it's coming.
1722420	1725380	In 5th Dreamer Greaves, Vampire Survivors is amazing.
1725380	1727780	Dartusia also saying, I don't blame you on Dark Souls.
1727780	1729980	I tried it, I couldn't get past the first mid-boss,
1729980	1731500	so I swore off soul stuff.
1731540	1734860	See, meanwhile, Alan, my other half,
1734860	1736860	loves those soul games.
1736860	1738820	So that's like his jam.
1738820	1742460	Yeah, and more power to him.
1742460	1744780	I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum.
1744780	1746700	That's my favorite game of the year, personally.
1746700	1747540	You can't change that.
1747540	1748800	So this is what it is.
1749900	1751580	S2100Matt says, I get what Rob is saying.
1751580	1752700	It's how it's implemented.
1752700	1753860	The core idea is not new,
1753860	1755660	but the implementation in this creative way
1755660	1756860	is kind of revolutionary.
1756860	1759580	Yeah, yeah, I think that's another good way of saying it.
1760420	1761460	So there you go.
1761460	1764540	That's my hot take on what probably
1764540	1765980	the best game of the year was.
1767300	1769540	As far as like, well, let's talk about now,
1769540	1772620	looking forward, like 2023, what do we think?
1773620	1776100	Let's make some off-the-wall predictions.
1776100	1778780	So I'll just say, let's do like three predictions.
1778780	1779820	We'll go around and each,
1779820	1781140	I think that's the way we used to do it.
1781140	1783060	We'll each go around and give a prediction,
1783060	1785860	and I will put it into a PowerPoint presentation,
1785860	1789620	since I don't have a jar that we can look at
1789620	1792740	at the end of the year and see what came true
1792740	1793620	and what didn't.
1793620	1795880	I would invite those of you in chat
1795880	1799060	over at twitch.tv slash vog network
1799060	1800860	to give your suggestions,
1800860	1802380	because if we can't think of something,
1802380	1803680	we might pull from our chat room
1803680	1806500	over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
1806500	1807340	So-
1807340	1809220	We could do a variant of it.
1809220	1810060	What's that?
1810060	1812500	The 2023 wishlist.
1812500	1814220	You wanna do a wishlist?
1814220	1815220	Yeah, why not?
1815420	1817700	Because some of my predictions have to do with things
1817700	1819380	that I don't think are gonna land well.
1819380	1821240	And it's not that I wish it on that,
1821240	1825920	but I'll tell you what my wishlist items are, but yeah.
1827580	1830620	One of them has to do with something not doing well.
1830620	1833220	So I wanna leave it, in fact, actually,
1833220	1835820	I think two of mine are perhaps construed negative.
1835820	1838160	I think one of them would actually ultimately be positive,
1838160	1839260	but we'll get to that.
1840620	1843060	So let's go around the table.
1843060	1845940	Loki, what's a prediction you have for 2023?
1846980	1848800	2023, hmm.
1851620	1855300	I think that, well, we're getting into a story
1855300	1858340	about something that's not gonna be short-handed
1858340	1861860	anytime soon, or apparently this year,
1861860	1864780	it's supposed to be readily available,
1864780	1866500	but that's only because the other thing
1866500	1869660	that's coming out this year, the PlayStation VR 2,
1869660	1873780	is gonna be impossible to find and scalp to death.
1874860	1878060	And there'll be shortages for that all year round.
1878060	1880100	So PSVR 2 impossible to find,
1880100	1881940	probably the safest bet you could take
1881940	1883500	when it comes to predictions.
1884500	1885340	Yeah.
1885340	1887380	I'm gonna go ahead and follow that, Jamie.
1887380	1888700	I hope you don't mind if I go out of order,
1888700	1890180	but that's because my next one
1890180	1892700	also has to do with the PSVR 2.
1892700	1894260	And I'm gonna be as bold to say,
1894260	1896980	I think the PSVR 2 is a flop.
1896980	1898820	I think the PSVR 2 does not move
1898860	1900900	the same type of numbers as the first one.
1900900	1902540	And I think there's multiple factors
1902540	1904260	that come into play this time.
1904260	1907340	I think number one, I don't think there's a launch title
1907340	1909100	that's gonna entice people.
1909100	1910620	I'm not saying they're bad.
1910620	1913100	I understand many of you have very passionate feelings
1913100	1915700	about the Dark Pictures anthology shooter,
1915700	1916540	and rightfully so.
1916540	1919300	I'm not paying $1,000 though for that.
1919300	1921420	That's the thing, it's like that console,
1921420	1925320	I had to get a PlayStation 5, which is like $500,
1925320	1928960	a PlayStation VR 2, which is $550.
1928960	1931120	I'm sorry, it's a great game.
1931120	1934120	I really wanna play it, not paying $1,000 to play it.
1934120	1937880	I actually think this is where some of the competitors
1937880	1941320	such as, you know, I'm not supposed to call it Oculus Rift,
1941320	1942160	but I'm going to,
1942160	1944480	because I still hate the name meta for the company,
1944480	1948600	but the Oculus Rift and some of the standalone VR devices,
1948600	1951240	I actually think they have a bit of an advantage here.
1951240	1953860	This wasn't the case the first time around
1953860	1957380	with the PlayStation VR, and I just think as well,
1957380	1960080	it also comes into those supply and demand issues.
1960080	1963180	I think there's gonna be a little bit of both.
1963180	1966140	I think it's that it's gonna be impossible to find.
1966140	1967700	They are not able to make a lot of them,
1967700	1969940	but I think at the same time, I think come the holidays,
1969940	1971740	they're not gonna move as many of them as they'd hoped to.
1971740	1973820	I think it's just gonna flop.
1973820	1976260	And I'm sorry, again, I don't mean to be negative,
1976260	1978580	or I'm not wishing that it's gonna flop.
1978580	1982100	I just think the math for this launch
1982100	1985300	doesn't add up the way it did the first time
1985300	1987100	with the original PlayStation VR.
1987100	1990060	I think the competition landscape looks a little different.
1990060	1992400	I'm not sure there's that must-have title
1992400	1994740	out of what we're seeing in the launch lineup.
1994740	1996940	I think if people want to play Horizon Zero Dawn,
1996940	1999520	Horizon Video West, they're gonna go play those games.
1999520	2001380	I just don't think, again,
2001380	2003720	I don't think there's that VR experience
2003720	2006660	that people are begging for.
2006660	2008420	YYR says, my prediction is that it sells out
2008420	2010660	its initial launch shipment and then not much else.
2010660	2011620	The tech looks amazing,
2011620	2015840	but Sony is not supporting it properly with AAA games.
2015840	2018980	Where is Spider-Man, Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted?
2018980	2021660	Bingo, that is exactly it.
2021660	2022580	On top of that too,
2022580	2026280	like you look at just people's financial situations.
2026280	2028360	We're in like a recession.
2029940	2032040	People are just gonna drop $550
2032040	2034360	after they dropped $500 for that console.
2034360	2037940	Like that's a tough sell.
2037940	2040140	And especially considering that that's more expensive
2040580	2043220	than say getting a MetaQuest 2 or something like that,
2043220	2047340	where that's a more affordable option
2047340	2050340	and you have PC titles, which there are tons of,
2050340	2053540	and you can get for much cheaper.
2053540	2055540	Like, I just, I don't know.
2055540	2057580	Like I said, I really do want to play
2057580	2058780	that Dark Pictures game.
2058780	2061700	I'm holding out that they put it on PC at some point.
2061700	2064440	And if not, then so be it.
2064440	2066720	I mean, I have Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,
2066720	2071400	but like I haven't used my PlayStation VR in years.
2071400	2072760	I haven't used my Rift in years,
2072760	2074520	although I keep buying games for it though still,
2074520	2076400	but I plan on it at some point,
2076400	2078520	but I haven't used my PlayStation VR for a while
2078520	2080020	and it's very dated.
2080020	2083900	It's just sad that I can't like use that on PC.
2083900	2088120	Like, poor Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, please.
2088120	2089500	Put it on the PC.
2089500	2090800	I think the one other thing I have to say,
2090800	2091640	I think, you know,
2091640	2093940	cause as much as I think Meta is actually unique,
2093940	2096520	I think now we're seeing why they got into VR
2097160	2098000	in the first place.
2098000	2101640	And also like, again, if Meta takes it a step further,
2101640	2104280	and I don't understand why they're not doing this more yet,
2104280	2105840	but maybe it's coming, I don't know,
2105840	2108800	and offers more experiences in VR
2108800	2111640	and is able to sell VR to the Facebook audience.
2111640	2112980	And let's be real, the Facebook crowd
2112980	2114700	and the PlayStation crowd are,
2114700	2116860	some of it overlaps, so not all of it right now.
2116860	2119440	I actually think Meta is a little more uniquely positioned.
2119440	2124440	However, there is a cloud looming all over all of this
2124800	2128260	because there is another VR device.
2128260	2132280	And if this VR device, A, is real,
2132280	2134400	and B, launches in 2023.
2134400	2137200	Eventually, whenever it decides to come out.
2137200	2140320	The quote goes, it is over for you hoes.
2140320	2141840	That is the quote for everybody else.
2141840	2143420	Exactly, because they're gonna come out and be like,
2143420	2145480	look it, we invented VR.
2145480	2147640	It's the first time you could ever experience it
2147640	2149000	because we came up with it.
2149000	2151320	If Apple puts out a VR device,
2151320	2153580	quote, it is over for you hoes.
2153580	2156580	That is my official, you know what,
2156580	2158260	that's my sub prediction.
2158260	2162140	If Apple puts out a VR device, it is over for you hoes.
2162140	2165000	That's what I'm writing on the card, all right?
2165000	2165840	All right, let's move on
2165840	2167220	because I think Dark Soccer probably has something
2167220	2169860	that is not VR, but maybe she'll surprise me, I don't know.
2169860	2172500	Dark Soccer, what's a prediction in your camp?
2172500	2175360	That the Google Chromebook cloud gaming system
2175360	2177060	is going to bomb.
2178140	2181040	Oh, do I sense a little stadia bitterness?
2181040	2182100	I'm not sure.
2182100	2182940	Tell me about this prediction.
2183260	2184620	That was a thing.
2184620	2186860	They're the ones who analysis a week
2186860	2189060	after saying they're getting rid of stadia.
2190340	2192900	So I'm just calling it like I see it.
2192900	2197900	People aren't gonna want to buy a whole laptop
2198740	2201920	just for cloud gaming and certainly not a Chromebook.
2201920	2204340	I mean, people are gonna want a good computer
2204340	2206640	to play good games on, you know.
2209240	2211700	I just don't see it successful.
2211780	2215460	I 100% agree with you because I'm also just,
2215460	2219180	no, nobody should support a Google gaming device
2219180	2221560	knowing their track record at this point.
2221560	2223180	Nobody should be buying that.
2223180	2224340	My money back.
2224340	2226420	Yeah, that's true, that's true, at least there's that.
2226420	2227820	And I think that they might think,
2227820	2229500	oh, well, that's gonna make it all better
2229500	2231060	and we're gonna do this announcement.
2231060	2234980	Some of us really enjoyed the platform, you know?
2234980	2237780	It was a good way, especially like those games
2237780	2238940	that like when they came out,
2238940	2241740	they were all like glitchy and stuff, you know, Cyberpunk.
2243100	2244540	I didn't have like a problem with it.
2244540	2246480	It played beautifully.
2246480	2250140	I mean, I did, Boosteroid kind of failed for me
2250140	2253900	because their servers just were fairly weak
2253900	2257460	and I'm on G-Force on like the middle program
2257460	2259160	and that one's doing just fine.
2260300	2264300	But at the same time, it's like that whole thing,
2264300	2269300	just to come out with that announcement right afterwards,
2270340	2273620	there's gonna be people who are gonna lobby against it,
2273620	2276520	number one, people who are more bitter than I am.
2278020	2280460	And then on top of that, there's just like,
2281320	2283620	I already have all of this computer stuff.
2283620	2286860	Why do I wanna buy another one just to play games on?
2286860	2287700	Exactly.
2287700	2288540	If they're gonna do that,
2288540	2291300	they're gonna get a Steam Deck.
2291300	2292140	Yeah, exactly.
2292140	2293580	And that's the thing, it's like you look at,
2293700	2297420	it's not necessarily just like a Google-developed device,
2297420	2299820	it's more of like they're trying to sell Chromebooks
2299820	2301140	a little bit more.
2301140	2304420	And I mean, you look at the Chromebooks that they offer,
2304420	2305780	like at least the one they highlight
2305780	2309700	on the official Google page, the cheapest one's $3.99.
2309700	2311620	I mean, you might as well just buy a Steam Deck
2311620	2312460	at that point.
2312460	2314860	You can do the cloud gaming on there
2314860	2316260	and you can get Steam games
2316260	2317980	and you can hook it up as a regular PC
2317980	2320340	and be able to run a lot of decent stuff.
2322180	2323560	No one should be messing with Chromebooks.
2324440	2326200	You're literally like my grandparents
2326200	2330240	who just check emails and maybe read the news and that's it.
2330240	2332120	That's the only reason you would need a Chromebook.
2332120	2334800	And even then, I would just suggest to get a tablet.
2334800	2337320	It just doesn't make sense.
2337320	2338920	I mean, seriously, all someone needs
2338920	2342480	is an iPad Pro and a keyboard and you're set.
2342480	2345440	Yeah, you don't need a Chromebook.
2345440	2346980	It's a weird sell.
2346980	2348880	It's like a Windows phone.
2348880	2352400	I sold my laptop when I got my iPad Pro
2352400	2355040	because it did everything my laptop did
2355040	2357960	and I have a Mac Mini to work on all my other stuff.
2357960	2362640	So yeah, the whole thing is just janky.
2364400	2367120	All right, there's a lot of chat going on
2367120	2369460	about the VR thing and that whole thing.
2369460	2370500	And I just want to,
2371540	2373600	because I thought it was a good comment here.
2373600	2375760	GZDR4EV says, you don't want to watch
2375760	2378960	The Last of Us TV show or the Twisted Metal show in VR.
2378960	2381200	Personally, maybe I do,
2381200	2385380	but not enough people to make a device like that,
2385380	2388140	like sell, sell, sell would be interested.
2388140	2390760	And it's a hard truth, I'm sorry.
2390760	2393840	However, again, because this company
2393840	2395520	knows how to make an entrance,
2395520	2398220	if Apple were to unveil one of those devices,
2398220	2399920	I'm telling you, they're going to have people
2399920	2401820	watching the new Avatar movie in it.
2401820	2404960	And even if you personally don't like that answer,
2404960	2407160	I'm telling you, look at the box office,
2407160	2408860	look at the track record.
2409700	2411900	It's going to move beaucoup.
2411900	2413900	If, you know, again, this is all, you know,
2413900	2415220	we know it's something they're-
2415220	2416060	Print money.
2416060	2418060	Yeah, we know it's something they're experimenting with.
2418060	2419440	We don't know when, we don't know where,
2419440	2420780	we don't even know if it'll actually happen.
2420780	2421900	Experimenting with it doesn't mean
2421900	2423180	they're ever going to do anything with it.
2423180	2424940	So, but yes, print money.
2424940	2427600	Yeah, you know that question mark, question mark,
2427600	2430400	question mark, step one,
2431420	2433540	Avatar in 3D home device,
2433540	2437220	question mark, question mark, question mark, profit, okay?
2437220	2439380	Apple has a team dedicated to that question mark,
2439380	2440820	question mark, question mark right now.
2440820	2443140	And either they're going to figure it out or they're not.
2443140	2444500	And that's where it goes from here.
2444500	2447020	Anyway, moving on, back to the gaming producer bit,
2447020	2449180	just since the chat is dominated with that talk,
2449180	2451060	I wanted to acknowledge that.
2451060	2454340	Okay, so back to predictions.
2454340	2455880	Loki, what's another one?
2457740	2458700	Let's see.
2463220	2465900	I think that-
2465900	2466820	And don't forget chat.
2467380	2468420	We are looking for your predictions too.
2468420	2470580	So don't forget to holler some of those out.
2474660	2478820	I think that the Activision, Blizzard,
2478820	2483100	Microsoft merger is never going to go through.
2484700	2486780	And what, why doesn't it go through?
2488740	2493740	Because they'll try to make an example of them somehow.
2494060	2496100	I don't know why they'd be punishing that,
2496580	2497940	entertainment company.
2497940	2502060	But the way I see it is like, it wouldn't go through.
2502060	2503220	And then when it doesn't go through,
2503220	2504580	Sony will try to buy them.
2505780	2508340	They'll try to buy Activision, Blizzard.
2508340	2511580	That is so shady, but I could see it.
2511580	2512900	Absolutely, I could see it.
2512900	2514960	So by the way, if y'all hear me typing,
2514960	2517620	it's because I am officially recording our predictions
2517620	2518460	to the record.
2518460	2521820	So please excuse my mechanical keyboard noises in the back.
2521820	2525140	All right, let's go, I guess I'll just go next
2525180	2527500	since I kind of created that order last time.
2527500	2530620	So my number two, okay.
2530620	2533180	Again, I hate to be negative,
2533180	2536300	but I think it's one of those things at the end of the day
2536300	2538480	is going to benefit this company at the end of the day.
2538480	2539780	And my prediction is that
2539780	2542940	Yoshisuke Matsuda is forced out of Square Enix.
2542940	2545500	I think all this talk about NFTs,
2545500	2549300	I think the way the general company's been kind of run,
2550180	2551980	and I think ultimately,
2552980	2557740	I'm not saying Final Fantasy XVI doesn't do well,
2558580	2563320	but I think the way the company has kind of failed
2563320	2565700	to respond to some of these issues,
2565700	2568220	such as the lack of diversity in the game.
2569780	2572380	And I know there is a subset of gamers probably
2572380	2573440	that don't listen to this show,
2573440	2574980	but there's probably a subset of gamers out there
2574980	2576260	that roll their eyes when I say that.
2576260	2579180	And my answer to that is, tough titty,
2579220	2582400	because this does ultimately impact sales.
2582400	2585920	People want to see themselves represented in games, period.
2585920	2588800	And although I still stand by
2588800	2592880	that this is a Japanese game industry problem,
2592880	2594340	here's the problem.
2594340	2597560	Now Square Enix is the poster child for that problem,
2597560	2602560	because Matsuda has failed to deflect the issue
2603140	2607380	or respond to it in any way, really.
2607380	2612380	And although I think Final Fantasy XVI does fine enough,
2613140	2617380	I think this is something we're gonna be reminded of
2617380	2622380	in many interviews, many reviews, many things,
2622500	2627500	that some would say it starts to be a distraction.
2629140	2631280	It's not a distraction, I wanna be clear,
2631280	2634740	but some would say that, especially in Japan.
2634740	2636420	And I think ultimately Matsuda-san,
2636420	2640340	between that and the NFT issue,
2640340	2644660	and I think this whole sale of the other stuff
2644660	2646640	with now that we know Crystal Dynamics
2646640	2648700	is making a Tomb Raider thing for Amazon,
2648700	2650340	I think all of these things are gonna be viewed
2650340	2652500	as poor fucking decisions
2652500	2654860	that we're trying to set the company up for being acquired,
2654860	2657780	and I don't think it gets acquired,
2657780	2662120	especially if what Loki just said plays out,
2662120	2664380	Square Enix is gonna get left at the altar
2664900	2666060	so that Sony can buy Activision Blizzard.
2666060	2667700	Of course, does that mean Microsoft buys Square Enix?
2667700	2668680	I don't know.
2668680	2673300	I kinda don't think Square Enix is bought this year,
2673300	2675700	and I think Matsuda-san pays the price for that
2675700	2678320	because the good thing
2678320	2680200	about the Japanese game development culture
2680200	2683020	is that it holds its leaders accountable,
2683020	2685540	unlike a certain Mr. Kotek.
2685540	2688700	So I think Matsuda pays the price
2688700	2690760	and leaves Square Enix this year.
2690760	2692340	That's my thought.
2693340	2697340	So, DarkSakura, do you have something more positive?
2698260	2700140	Speaking of Kotek,
2701420	2703740	I think one way or another,
2703740	2706340	the company's going to be purchased,
2706340	2710740	and not only is he going to find himself out of a job,
2710740	2712620	I have a feeling that there are gonna be
2712620	2717620	even more legal proceedings against him personally.
2717900	2720220	You know, people are gonna dig up dirt.
2720220	2723100	He deserves to have everything thrown at him
2723100	2724100	and buried for it.
2725900	2727940	Maybe that's wishful thinking,
2727940	2731900	but I would love to see a crusty,
2731900	2734580	horrible man in power just suffer.
2736260	2737100	That's all.
2739740	2741380	Can't say I would,
2741380	2744660	I mean, the only problem is
2744660	2747380	he'll just laugh on his bed of money the whole way out,
2747380	2748740	and so that sucks,
2748740	2753740	but I do agree that the name should not be looked on fondly.
2753980	2756380	The history books can still record
2756380	2757220	somebody's name a certain way.
2757220	2762020	I want to see him completely lose
2762020	2765980	just any semblance of future business opportunities,
2765980	2767380	all because of this.
2767380	2768220	That'll never happen.
2768220	2769060	He'll get promoted.
2769060	2770380	He'll leave the company and go somewhere else
2770380	2772980	and be super god of whatever company it is.
2772980	2773780	Fucking men.
2773780	2776140	Sorry, don't mean it that way, but-
2776140	2776980	No, I get it.
2777700	2779500	I sort of, yes.
2779500	2781420	I think to what Loki's saying,
2781420	2784420	I do think he ends up on the boards of certain companies,
2784420	2786660	but I think the companies he ends up on the boards of
2786660	2787940	are just kind of like,
2787940	2789620	they're gonna be fucking NFT companies
2789620	2791060	and things that are bullshit anyway.
2791060	2793340	Like that's how I sort of see it playing out.
2793340	2796500	Not gonna have any meaningful opportunities.
2796500	2797340	Right.
2798820	2800020	All right, let's go-
2800020	2802100	Of course, I have another idea,
2802100	2803780	but I'm not gonna say it loud.
2807020	2808580	All right.
2808580	2810620	No, it's not violent.
2810620	2811620	All right, fair enough.
2811620	2812940	Okay, let's go.
2812940	2814300	One more prediction from everyone.
2814300	2815140	Loki.
2816100	2818220	All right, so I'm gonna give you two
2818220	2819780	just because one's gonna be runner up
2819780	2821100	because it's more of like a wish
2821100	2822940	and I know it's never gonna come true anyways, but-
2822940	2824020	You can always break the rules around here.
2824020	2824860	That's fine.
2824860	2825860	That's fine.
2825860	2827860	So my official one is gonna be that
2827860	2830180	Nintendo's gonna finally announce that new console
2830180	2831500	that they've got cooking up.
2831500	2833620	It's not coming out until next year though.
2833620	2834780	I guess that's awfully safe,
2834820	2837260	but it'll be right around the corner.
2838220	2839060	So there's that.
2839060	2843180	And then my second kind of a wish
2843180	2844780	that I would wish would happen is
2844780	2847420	the cocaine bear game is gonna be insane
2847420	2849260	and it's gonna be awesome.
2849260	2850900	And I just hope it comes out.
2850900	2853100	Except they're not making a cocaine bear game.
2853100	2854220	And that's a very,
2854220	2857280	I absolute missed opportunity right there.
2857280	2858120	I'm telling you.
2858120	2859400	They're not making a Megan game either.
2859400	2860240	And let me tell you-
2860240	2861060	I know.
2861060	2862260	That is one of the best movies I've seen
2862260	2863100	in a long time.
2863100	2864060	I want to see that.
2864740	2865580	I want to see that.
2865580	2866540	I want to see cocaine bear.
2866540	2869500	And I still want to see violent night at some point.
2869500	2871940	I just can't, you know,
2871940	2874540	probably end up having to watch it on streaming.
2874540	2875980	So quick aside,
2875980	2878900	because you know I love me a good Shane story here on OLR.
2878900	2879820	You know, my friend, Shane,
2879820	2882580	who's guested on my stream and has been on this show
2882580	2884500	time and time again over the years.
2884500	2887260	He told me he was going to go see Megan with some friends.
2887260	2888260	And I'm kind of like,
2888260	2891160	I don't know if that is going to really be up Shane's alley,
2891160	2892060	but I'm like,
2892060	2895960	I'm dying to know what you think of Megan.
2895960	2899700	Please call me as soon as you leave the theater.
2899700	2900520	And he did.
2900520	2903040	He called me and he's like,
2903040	2904980	that wasn't a horror movie.
2904980	2906820	That was a comedy,
2906820	2907860	but it was funny.
2907860	2909700	It looks funny.
2909700	2912100	And I would say that it isn't really a horror movie.
2912100	2912940	It's a comedy.
2912940	2913780	It's like,
2913780	2915700	see my favorite horror movie is Elvira,
2915700	2916860	Mistress of the Dark.
2916860	2918060	And that's what most people would say.
2918060	2919420	That's not a horror movie.
2919420	2920680	That's a comedy.
2920680	2922140	And it's like,
2922140	2923360	yes,
2923360	2924200	but it's,
2924200	2926680	I think horror can be anyone's genre.
2926680	2927600	Yes, it is.
2927600	2929120	There can be funny horror movies.
2929120	2929960	Exactly.
2929960	2933820	And it's even funnier if you just kind of close your eyes
2933820	2937820	for just a second and imagine it's not Megan, the doll,
2937820	2939400	it's Michelle Tanner.
2939400	2940400	It's even funnier.
2945780	2946620	All right.
2948360	2949980	Dark Sakura, like seriously,
2950140	2952020	I will see it again if you need a date.
2952020	2952860	Just saying.
2955580	2957640	I have a couple of things that I want to see.
2957640	2958480	That one was on the spot.
2958480	2959300	We should do that.
2959300	2960220	We'll do a triple date.
2960220	2961060	Come on.
2961060	2961900	I would love to see that movie.
2961900	2962740	Triple date.
2962740	2963560	Yay.
2963560	2964400	I'd love that.
2964400	2965220	All right.
2965220	2966340	When was the last time the three of us hang out
2966340	2968260	in the same physical space?
2968260	2969100	When we,
2969100	2969940	I don't know.
2969940	2971900	I remember when the last times we went on a triple date
2971900	2973740	was to go see the original Avatar.
2973740	2976100	So it would be really fucking funny
2976100	2977740	if the next time we go on a triple date
2977740	2980540	was to see the counter-programming to Avatar.
2983540	2984380	I still haven't seen it.
2984380	2985200	Yeah, I still.
2985200	2986380	I do actually want to see.
2986380	2988980	I'm mildly interested in Avatar, the new one.
2988980	2991140	I hear it's good, but that was the way I felt
2991140	2991980	about the first one.
2991980	2994380	The first one I was like, eh, I'm okay.
2994380	2996060	And I saw it and I was like, it's all right.
2996060	2997340	I'm waiting for Blu-ray
2997340	2999220	because I know I'm going to need a poop break
2999220	3000180	with that movie.
3000180	3001300	Like, let's be real.
3001300	3002980	That movie is long.
3002980	3004660	I just went on streaming that one.
3004660	3005800	Yeah.
3005800	3006640	All right.
3007740	3009900	Let's see.
3009900	3012620	Pod culture says, OLR, the movie review podcast.
3012620	3013460	You never know.
3013460	3014740	You know, we have a TikTok now.
3014740	3017380	We could record these adventures to the movies.
3017380	3018200	I'm just saying.
3018200	3019040	All right.
3020280	3021120	My turn.
3021120	3021960	Okay.
3021960	3023020	Oops, sorry.
3023020	3028020	Somebody actually posted something that's very adjacent
3028540	3031520	to what I'm about to say, which is, it is a good thing.
3031520	3033040	And I'm going bold.
3033040	3036580	I'm swinging for the rafters with this prediction.
3036580	3039640	But I think we have a big year for games.
3039640	3040620	That's not the prediction.
3040620	3041660	That's the truth.
3041660	3043100	We have like Starfield.
3043100	3044860	We have a new Zelda game coming out.
3044860	3046620	We have Final Fantasy 16.
3046620	3047940	We have Diablo four.
3047940	3050180	Like we have game after game after game.
3050180	3052420	This is a huge year for games.
3052420	3053500	And you know what?
3053500	3056420	As long as everybody else is getting in on it,
3056420	3060800	my prediction is Valve releases A3.
3062660	3064700	It's 2023.
3064700	3065540	It is time.
3065540	3067700	Valve releases A3.
3067700	3068960	What three?
3068960	3069800	That's up to them.
3069800	3071300	And I'm not going to go that far.
3071300	3073720	Although some would argue Half-Life Alyx was a three,
3073720	3075100	but we're not going to go there.
3075100	3076180	I'm going to say Valve.
3076180	3077420	There's no three in the title.
3077420	3078260	It doesn't count.
3078260	3079500	It releases A3.
3079500	3081300	Yeah, if there's no three in the title, it doesn't count.
3081300	3084540	Unless, as Bobby Blackwolf says, that title is Megan.
3084540	3085420	That will count.
3087420	3089740	Which of course is M3GAN.
3089740	3093020	A Valve Megan game will absolutely count, period.
3093020	3095380	Just putting that in the footnote.
3096180	3097020	But otherwise, yes, it must have a three.
3097020	3101980	We must have Left 4 Dead 3, Half-Life 3, Portal 3,
3101980	3103920	like any of these will work.
3104880	3105720	All right.
3105720	3108640	In 2023, this is the year to do it.
3108640	3111340	You have a three in the year title.
3111340	3112500	Yeah, as two and a half Matt says,
3112500	3114340	we can keep predicting three with Valve.
3114340	3116220	At some point, it will come true.
3116220	3118140	And the time they will announce it?
3118140	3118980	E3.
3123500	3124340	I don't know.
3124340	3125180	I'm not convinced.
3125820	3126940	I would take a Team Fortress 3.
3126940	3127860	I really would.
3127860	3129060	I think it'd be fantastic.
3129060	3129940	Hell yes.
3129940	3134220	And like, I would argue Overwatch is vulnerable.
3134220	3136620	Like, I'm not gonna say, like, I'm not talking shit.
3136620	3138340	I enjoyed Overwatch 2.
3138340	3140640	I would just say, I don't think Blizzard
3140640	3145640	is the king of that hill the way it's assumed they are.
3146180	3147700	And I think a Team Fortress 3
3147700	3150920	could absolutely disrupt things severely.
3150920	3152960	And, I don't know how funny,
3152960	3155320	people are talking about Steam Deck 3.
3155320	3156880	I'm not sure Steam Deck 3 counts,
3156880	3160100	but I think Steam Deck is just motivation for them to do it.
3160100	3160940	So.
3160940	3163160	I'll just do Counter Strike Go 2.
3163160	3164000	You're like, dammit.
3164000	3165160	Yeah.
3165160	3166160	Phil of Nine in chat says,
3166160	3168080	I played Overwatch 2 for a month and was like,
3168080	3170080	wait, this is the same game as Overwatch 1.
3170080	3171680	I mean, if you want to get technical,
3171680	3173960	it's 5v5, not 6v6, huh?
3173960	3175160	But I get it.
3175160	3177120	Cause I also played for a month and now I'm like,
3177120	3179000	okay, like that was cute.
3179000	3181460	So I would absolutely check out a Team Fortress 3.
3181460	3182800	I think y'all laugh,
3183480	3184880	but that absolutely could be the game.
3184880	3187480	And it counts cause a three would be in it.
3187480	3188300	All right.
3188300	3191000	Last but certainly not least, Dark Sakura,
3191000	3192340	a bold third prediction,
3192340	3194240	bold third three prediction from you.
3200040	3200880	I don't know.
3202120	3203120	I really don't know.
3205040	3208620	I literally cannot think of anything.
3209620	3211940	Jamie's prediction.
3211940	3213440	I literally can't.
3213440	3218440	How about you predict a killer for 2023 and.
3219060	3220780	Is this Jason's year?
3220780	3223820	Well, I have a list and a few of them
3223820	3226620	have some substantial evidence behind them.
3228380	3233380	So I am hoping that we get Candyman.
3234380	3238980	That would be amazing or, or a pumpkin head.
3240980	3245720	But actually what I see happening,
3245720	3248820	and this also may be wishful thinking is that I think
3248820	3252700	they're going to do even more retooling of the game
3252700	3256660	to remove any benefit from camping and tunneling.
3257680	3260640	I think just in general, it needs a rework.
3260880	3264800	They need to skip a patch cycle to just work on the game.
3264800	3265640	Like it's.
3265640	3268160	The thing is that new players are doing it.
3268160	3270400	You see it really heavily at rank reset
3271320	3275680	and they think that this is how you're supposed to play.
3275680	3280040	And sorry, kills do not equal skills.
3280040	3282360	It means you are cheap and lazy.
3282360	3283720	So let me answer this in chat
3283720	3285600	because I'm going to take this question seriously
3285600	3286760	and give you a serious answer.
3286760	3290680	So Tiger Claw in chat says, how about Megan as a DLC?
3290680	3293720	And as much as I want to jump out of my seat and go, yes,
3293720	3295720	yes, it's not going to happen.
3295720	3296680	I'm going to tell you why.
3296680	3297520	Because go back.
3297520	3298640	She's a child.
3298640	3302360	There's that Android, but yes, I know.
3302360	3306040	Cause the ring is also a child.
3306040	3307320	She's not, but she's not a child.
3307320	3308440	She's 19.
3308440	3309640	Oh, I thought she was a child.
3309640	3310480	All right, anyway.
3310480	3312100	No, that's only in the, in the crappy,
3312100	3314600	horrible American version and the Japanese version.
3314600	3315440	Okay, thank you.
3315440	3319240	The whole story is of her going to be an actress,
3319240	3321080	how she kills her acting troop,
3321080	3322560	goes back and her dad kills her.
3322560	3324840	Well, I just always think of the, I'm sorry,
3324840	3328040	but she has the best hooking emotion in the entire game
3328040	3330120	where she has to lift them up and the hook comes down
3330120	3332840	because she shows sword and then goes back up.
3332840	3334200	It's so funny.
3334200	3335600	Anyway, but I love Sadako.
3335600	3338040	But Sadako is canonically a young adult.
3339240	3340880	Okay, fair enough.
3340880	3342680	S2 and Hunter Matt says, what about the Babadook?
3342680	3343960	For Pride Month, I totally take him.
3343960	3345120	Oh, I want to go back to the Megan thing
3345640	3346480	and why not?
3346480	3348080	Because of Shane's review.
3348080	3350000	It's not a horror movie, it's a comedy.
3350000	3351720	And I think ultimately that is,
3351720	3353520	that is what it boils down to.
3353520	3355080	If they're going to give us that,
3355080	3357760	then they should give us the comedy
3357760	3360000	that would be an even better,
3360000	3362400	I'm going to say yes, this would be even better
3362400	3365560	for Dead by Daylight.
3365560	3366600	Evil Dead though.
3366600	3367960	Oh, no, when I say comedy,
3367960	3370240	I mean we need Brenda Meeks from Scary Movie.
3370240	3372080	That's the one that we need.
3373080	3375560	The rumor was for the longest time
3375560	3377320	that we were supposed to get Sidney
3377320	3379040	when we got Ghostface,
3379040	3380760	except it's just the Ghostface
3380760	3383440	and not, you know, the movie character.
3383440	3385520	Also, I think unfortunately
3385520	3387480	with what Nev Campbell's going through,
3387480	3388520	I mean, I...
3388520	3390840	Yeah, I mean, I'm just said in general.
3390840	3393000	But there's no, I mean,
3393000	3396240	Jenny Ortega is literally everywhere right now.
3396240	3397800	There's no reason her, I mean,
3397800	3399960	I know I should bite my tongue immediately
3400000	3402600	that I ever say, you know, Sidney is replaceable.
3402600	3404720	She's not, but let's be real,
3404720	3408160	we didn't get Heather Lagenkamp with the...
3408160	3409880	Because they did the new version.
3409880	3410920	They did the new version.
3410920	3413600	So I would say you'd have a better chance
3413600	3414840	of getting Jenny Ortega,
3414840	3417160	I can't remember her name in the screen, sorry.
3417160	3418000	Was it Sam?
3418000	3418840	No, Sam was the other person.
3418840	3420640	I didn't, I don't like those movies.
3420640	3424240	But anyway, especially because her particularly
3424240	3426200	between that and Wednesday,
3426200	3428120	she's having a real good year.
3428120	3429280	She had a really good 2022.
3429440	3430680	Season two, baby.
3430680	3431640	Can't wait.
3431640	3434000	Yeah, she's having a good year, so.
3434000	3437400	If you want the, you know, the feel of Harry Potter,
3437400	3439600	but you don't wanna support Harry Potter,
3439600	3440880	Wednesday's your ticket.
3441880	3444120	That is a glowing reveal, actually.
3445560	3447040	I mean, it's basically Harry Potter.
3447040	3449040	It's except without, you know.
3449040	3450520	Without transphobia. Transphobia.
3450520	3452920	I, and I love, I've always loved the Addams family.
3452920	3454000	So I'm here for that.
3454000	3454840	It's great.
3454840	3456280	I love that series.
3456280	3458320	We made our kids watch it and it's great.
3459680	3461040	To go back though,
3462120	3465040	I think that some of these rumored licenses,
3465040	3468720	we are going to start seeing them around.
3468720	3471000	Candyman has been teased for a while
3471000	3473840	and the actor of the original Candyman
3473840	3476600	was approached to work with behavior.
3477480	3479400	And they're often saying that they'll work
3479400	3482360	on their chapters sometimes years in advance.
3482360	3483280	Yeah.
3483280	3485120	I would, I would love, I mean,
3485120	3487280	I was right about Wesker, wasn't I?
3488120	3490600	Well, it wasn't too hard to predict, but yes.
3490600	3492840	Yeah, but I mean, we had Nemesis first
3492840	3494760	and I was like, it's gonna be Wesker.
3496800	3501560	I also am thinking that there's going to be
3501560	3503960	a new, another graphical overhaul
3503960	3508560	for some of the areas that hadn't,
3508560	3512320	or that maybe were overhauled a little bit longer ago.
3513240	3516600	And I certainly think that the stupid Borga area,
3516760	3519520	the Knights area is gonna be changed.
3520360	3521520	It looks terrible.
3521520	3522880	It looks like old Cornwind.
3524480	3525360	All right.
3525360	3528200	So let's put them in, lock them in.
3528200	3530480	So here are the recaps one more time.
3530480	3532320	PSVR2 impossible to find.
3532320	3534160	PSVR2 flops.
3534160	3536200	Google Chrome game book bombs.
3536200	3538160	ABK Microsoft merger doesn't go through
3538160	3540160	and an example is made of them.
3540160	3542040	Matsuda forced out of Square Enix.
3542040	3544520	Kotick forced out of the working world completely.
3544520	3546360	Nintendo finally announces new console
3546960	3549400	for what they're cooking up next year.
3549400	3551800	Cocaine Bear game is insane and awesome.
3551800	3554800	Valve releases a three, literally can't even,
3554800	3555920	I'm still putting that in there
3555920	3559400	and DVD Candyman or Pumpkinhead were the,
3559400	3561040	kind of the first two that I picked up there.
3561040	3563360	So, all right, there you go.
3563360	3565120	Cause I think it'd be funny to look back.
3565120	3567360	Why did Jamie predict literally can't even?
3568400	3569240	Is that a prediction?
3569240	3570080	Because I couldn't.
3571400	3574800	I mean, and there's gonna be new chapters, you know?
3574800	3577240	I mean, we even are talking about other changes
3577240	3579320	coming to Dead by Daylight,
3579320	3581760	rumored with very reliable resources.
3582920	3584960	Get to that in a little bit.
3584960	3588080	Meanwhile, probably speaking of Dead by Daylight,
3588080	3590080	let's get to what we've been doing this week
3590080	3591360	in our gaming weeks.
3591360	3593680	So let's get to, how was your gaming week?
3593680	3594520	Dark Sakura.
3595720	3597160	I played Dead by Daylight.
3598720	3600040	I actually played Killer.
3601120	3602880	Oh yeah, I peeked at your stream for a little bit
3602880	3604440	and I saw you playing Pig and I was like,
3605040	3606720	oh, she's back on her pig bullshit.
3606720	3608960	Rob, that pig game?
3608960	3610520	Adept first try.
3610520	3612160	Oh, good job, congrats.
3612160	3614840	Right after that, Freddy, Adept first try.
3614840	3616480	Lucky you.
3616480	3618800	I almost got Adept for Nemesis
3620120	3624680	because I actually got a 3K and the hatch
3624680	3628840	and someone managed to, no, I didn't get the hatch.
3628840	3631560	It was in Cornwind, so it was really hard to find the hatch.
3631560	3632960	So someone got it.
3632960	3636960	But it was a pretty solid 3K, that one.
3638360	3642840	And I got a lot better with his tentacle power.
3642840	3645520	But I had a really shitty pyramid head game
3645520	3647120	and people were just being children.
3647120	3648400	And so I was like,
3648400	3650040	well, I'm gonna go play another pyramid head game.
3650040	3653760	I got to get another 20 seconds of chase in.
3653760	3656840	And that's when the power went out, end of my stream.
3656840	3660480	I had gone a whole hour longer, so I'm not mad about it.
3660520	3664520	But I hated that it was on that terrible pyramid head game.
3664520	3666240	I'm a little worried for you tonight, though,
3666240	3668880	because I think the rain starts around 10 o'clock, 10 30.
3668880	3670280	So fingers and toes crossed
3670280	3672960	you make it through tonight's stream after the OLR.
3672960	3674680	See, I'm gonna be doing,
3676280	3679800	I mean, tonight is quite likely gonna be
3679800	3682080	a survivor night anyway,
3682080	3684160	unless Gwen doesn't wanna play.
3684160	3687720	And other than that, then I'll find ways of doing things.
3687720	3689240	I'm still trying to work through my Adepts
3689280	3692040	and if I may say so,
3692040	3696120	I'm doing a subathon on Friday the 13th,
3696120	3698200	starting noon to midnight.
3698200	3700240	Yeah, I picked it on purpose.
3700240	3703800	It's also like the weekend before I go back to work maybe.
3703800	3708800	So if you wanna see the shenanigans, come on by.
3709760	3712160	You might even get to play with me.
3712160	3713400	I'll try to make a cameo.
3713400	3715480	I have to work Friday, of course, but I'll try to-
3715480	3717120	Well, it's going until midnight.
3717120	3717960	So you got time.
3717960	3718800	Okay, I got time in the evening.
3719280	3720320	I have to travel Friday too,
3720320	3723160	assuming there isn't another fricking storm
3723160	3724440	because apparently they're all back to back to back.
3724440	3725720	But anyway.
3725720	3727000	Yeah, it is what it is.
3727000	3727840	It is what it is.
3727840	3730600	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
3732040	3734960	It was all Minecraft again.
3734960	3739560	So I finished up an episode and put that out.
3739560	3743120	And now I'm working in my modded series too.
3743120	3745120	I need to film something for that.
3745120	3746920	I've been just actually playing it.
3746920	3749320	So more to come.
3750240	3752760	All right, my gaming week.
3752760	3754880	I've continued on my MMO stuff,
3754880	3756680	but now I'm kind of doing equal time
3756680	3758360	with Final Fantasy XIV and WoW.
3758360	3759600	And I have to say,
3759600	3762240	I kind of thought I hit the point where I was kind of like,
3762240	3763600	okay, I think I'm done with WoW
3763600	3765440	just because I ran out of things to do.
3765440	3766960	Like I beat the main campaign.
3766960	3769160	I'm not interested in really raiding and all that stuff.
3769160	3771040	And I was like, eh, I could do mythics,
3771040	3774240	but I don't really know if I'll get a group or whatever.
3774280	3775600	And then like out of the blue,
3775600	3779160	I'm on during world quests and Extrofer from Horde House,
3779160	3782200	his husband is playing right now
3782200	3783400	and like sent me a message and went,
3783400	3784960	hey, you want to heal a mythic for us?
3784960	3787800	And I was like, all right, sure, I'll try.
3787800	3790200	And I'm like, I'm not very good.
3790200	3791040	I don't know how it's going to go.
3791040	3793000	He's like, whatever, whatever, let's just do it.
3793000	3796640	And sure enough, we changed like four mythics.
3796640	3798560	We got my keystone all the way to level eight.
3798560	3800720	We beat, or we actually got it all the way to level 10
3800720	3802960	because we beat Temple of the Jade Serpent on level eight.
3802960	3804160	And I thought that was neat too.
3805040	3807200	I didn't realize they throw classic dungeons, just a few,
3807200	3809280	but like Temple of the Jade Serpent from Pandaria
3809280	3811360	and the Shadow Moon Burial Grounds from Draenor
3811360	3813400	are like actually in the classic rotation
3813400	3814480	of mythic dungeons.
3814480	3815400	I thought that was pretty cool.
3815400	3817640	So, cause that's something I've kind of wanted WoW
3817640	3821720	to do for a while is bring back their old content
3821720	3822640	in a meaningful way.
3822640	3824080	And they're actually kind of doing that.
3824080	3827760	So I'm going to give them kudos for taking that feedback.
3827760	3830320	But then Final Fantasy has a big patch on Tuesday
3830320	3831360	and I'm prepping for that
3831360	3833520	because Island Sanctuary is getting updates
3833600	3835120	and I love Island Sanctuary.
3835120	3836520	So I'm really excited about that.
3836520	3838920	So yeah, MMO, MMO.
3838920	3840640	Did I play anything that wasn't an MMO?
3840640	3845640	Yes, I dabbled with Portal, the original,
3846000	3849000	but you might remember they recently re-released it
3849000	3851400	as Portal with RTX.
3851400	3852800	And I was curious, I was like,
3852800	3854280	oh, I wonder I have a newer machine.
3854280	3855600	I wonder how that's going to run.
3855600	3859800	So I fired it up and it turns out it's the first game
3859800	3861560	that my nice brand new computer
3861560	3862720	kind of chokes on a little bit,
3862760	3865760	at least in 4K, which yeah,
3865760	3868600	you want to do 4K RTX, okay, look, I know.
3868600	3871880	My graphics card is pretty good, but it's not that good.
3871880	3874680	But I can play in like 2K pretty well.
3874680	3878200	So that was fun.
3878200	3880400	So, you know, Portal's a standby old favorite.
3880400	3882400	I'm glad they're still making that game look good
3882400	3883640	all these years later.
3883640	3886280	I wish they would just do a three, but okay.
3886280	3887920	Put a fresh coat of paint on the classics.
3887920	3889960	At least I didn't have to pay anything for it either.
3889960	3891200	It was something that was just included
3891200	3892320	because I own the original Portal.
3892320	3893160	So that was nice.
3893160	3895520	So, s2100matt in chat says,
3895520	3897440	my gaming week was MagFest.
3897440	3899480	I'm so curious how that was this year.
3899480	3901520	You'll have to tell me more about how MagFest went.
3901520	3903800	I'm curious if you were there too while they are.
3903800	3905200	Maybe you didn't go this year
3905200	3908920	because I know you have your daughter and all that yet now.
3908920	3910280	I don't know if you still go to MagFest,
3910280	3912000	but I'd be super, super curious
3912000	3913680	how that was for those that went.
3913680	3916800	So, oh, he posted a bunch of pics and vids
3916800	3919560	in a thread in our conventions channel on Discord.
3919600	3922000	I did see some of the pics,
3922000	3926440	but I didn't see all of the videos.
3926440	3927280	Hold on, hold on.
3927280	3928960	Let me, we'll do it live.
3928960	3929800	Let me do this.
3929800	3933960	I'm going to go here and I'm going to go to conventions
3933960	3935920	and oh, we're not seeing anything.
3935920	3936760	I'm sorry.
3936760	3939740	Let me try to figure out what's going on over here.
3942520	3943600	Sorry, folks.
3943600	3945820	Oh, I think this is because of the update they just did.
3945820	3946660	There we go.
3946660	3948900	Okay, yeah, this is interesting.
3949100	3951680	So they have some actual machines that are there.
3954060	3955100	Yeah, I did see some of these.
3955100	3956820	So I saw that there's like plenty of sound
3956820	3958820	Voltex machines that they have set up and said,
3958820	3961220	wow, like three Step Maniacs cabs.
3961220	3963420	So they were set for the music game fans.
3963420	3964580	Ooh, there's some Pokken for.
3964580	3966700	I just got one of those nearby too.
3966700	3968420	They opened up a brand new arcade here
3968420	3969860	in the Folsom outlets
3969860	3971620	and they've got a Step Maniacs there
3971620	3974660	in the groove three, totally legit.
3974660	3978140	Do you know why that arcade is totally loaded?
3978220	3980260	It's probably either from the Rockland one
3980260	3982140	or from the drive-in, I'm guessing.
3982140	3984420	It is the same guy who stocked the Rockland one
3984420	3986820	in the drive-in that actually runs that arcade.
3986820	3989260	So that arcade is gonna be a hotspot.
3989260	3990100	Oh, neat.
3990100	3991500	Someone doing a speed run of Portal
3991500	3993640	with Ellen McClain doing commentary.
3993640	3994940	That's pretty awesome.
3994940	3995780	Bye.
3995780	3996620	That's awesome.
3996620	3998940	I do actually have some other local news.
3998940	4000100	Oh yeah, what's that?
4001400	4004780	The game room is having a new arcade director.
4006400	4007740	Oh, really?
4008220	4009520	That's all I know about it,
4009520	4013380	but apparently Joe is gone.
4013380	4014220	Interesting.
4015740	4018560	But yeah, I was gonna say, speaking of Ellen McClain,
4019480	4023780	I was really taken with how much GLaDOS inspiration
4023780	4024900	there was in Megan.
4024900	4028140	That was pretty impressive, for sure.
4028140	4029780	Let's see, some indie arcade games.
4029780	4031260	I'm not gonna go through all of these videos,
4031260	4032540	especially live.
4032540	4034160	Typing party arcade game.
4034160	4036140	This is a rock, paper, scissor game
4036180	4038140	where you have to protect your fort
4038140	4041360	from flying rock, paper, and scissors.
4044460	4045300	What is this?
4045300	4046600	Typing party.
4046600	4047760	This looks kind of fun.
4050220	4051740	I'm waiting for the actual action to happen.
4051740	4053060	Oh, here we go.
4053060	4055700	Oh, so you're actually typing the word
4055700	4057520	that goes with the rock, paper, scissor.
4057520	4059380	Oh, that's clever.
4059380	4061300	So it's like you're on two sides
4061300	4063820	and they're throwing things at each other
4063820	4065780	using the rock, paper, scissors mechanic.
4066340	4067660	All right, that's clever.
4067660	4068540	I like that.
4068540	4069860	Thank you for that video.
4069860	4073040	And let's see, Pin City.
4073040	4073880	What was the one?
4073880	4074700	You said something in chat.
4074700	4078780	Oh, a pinball walkthrough for dark soccer, I guess.
4078780	4080660	And any pinball fan out there.
4080660	4082240	It is hard to make out some of these machines,
4082240	4083620	but I see a Godzilla.
4085440	4088340	There we go, the lighting kicked in there.
4088340	4089180	Okay.
4091900	4093180	So it's-
4093180	4094300	Did you play Weird Al?
4094300	4095780	Was there a Weird Al?
4095780	4097460	Oh yeah, was there a Weird Al?
4097460	4099500	If Stern had a presence there,
4099500	4100980	not Stern, but a P3.
4102080	4103540	Anyway, thank you for the videos.
4103540	4105420	It looks like the gaming area is still hopping.
4105420	4107140	Oh God, you'll have to go
4107140	4109340	because he sent like seven pinball videos.
4109340	4110880	Unfortunately, I can't play them all live,
4110880	4113220	but yeah, wow, it looks like it was hopping over there.
4113220	4115140	Holy goodness, like BeatMania machines
4115140	4117600	right up next to each other, like several of them.
4117600	4119660	Yeah, it looks like Magfest was pretty off the hook.
4119660	4122080	There's a lot of interesting collectibles in there too.
4122080	4122920	All right.
4123500	4125160	If you want to go through the channel later on,
4125160	4127720	and I suggest you do, head on over to our Discord channel,
4127720	4130260	vognetwork.com slash Discord,
4130260	4132840	and you can actually look for that thread
4132840	4134920	in the conventions channel.
4134920	4136960	There's a thread, you kind of hover over it
4136960	4139860	and you can see Magfest 2023 photos, videos.
4139860	4141800	Thank you, Matt, for uploading that.
4141800	4142760	Really appreciate that.
4142760	4145360	And by the way, since we didn't have an OLR last week,
4145360	4149240	may I say congratulations and mazel tov, Matt,
4149240	4151880	on your engagement, because that happened.
4152880	4156320	So thank you for, that reminded me to say that
4156320	4158720	because we weren't here last week, so.
4158720	4161280	And s2100matt says, no Weird Al, sadly.
4161280	4165640	Lexi Light Speed was a pretty cool newer to me table, so.
4165640	4168440	Lexi Light Speed is a pretty fun one, I have to admit.
4168440	4169780	I had a lot of fun with that one.
4169780	4171320	There's some others that I don't like,
4171320	4174280	but my top two, Weird Al is at the top
4174280	4176380	and then Lexi Light Speed.
4176380	4178240	Dr. Studio says, yeah, I'm sad we don't have any cons
4178240	4180580	like that near us outside San Diego Comic-Con,
4180580	4182260	but that's a bit out of our price range.
4182260	4184760	They used to have a big one.
4184760	4187180	I don't think it was Barstow, maybe it was Riverside,
4187180	4188820	but it was somewhere out in Inland Empire.
4188820	4192540	They had like a big, but they liquidated that whole thing.
4192540	4193380	Remember that?
4193380	4195200	It was somebody who brought it up on the show
4195200	4196580	that they were kind of keeping an eye on that
4196580	4197900	as that was liquidating.
4197900	4199820	But yeah, probably the closest thing you have right now
4199820	4201840	is California Extreme, that I know of.
4201840	4203440	I'm sure Southern California must have
4203440	4205740	some arcade collectible community there
4205740	4207820	that maybe we just don't know where the show is yet.
4207820	4211180	But anyway, we got to move on.
4211180	4213220	We got to get into the news this week.
4213220	4215860	There still are a few things that happened,
4215860	4216780	so let's get into it.
4216780	4221620	Some pretty big news headlines to kick off 2023, right, Loki?
4221620	4223740	Yep, there's actually things this week.
4223740	4230200	So first off, we've got another studio that is unionizing.
4230200	4234580	So the Blizzard studio that has worked on, I guess,
4234580	4237140	the World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight.
4237140	4244660	It's Proletariat announced that they're, I guess,
4244660	4247420	planning on unionizing on.
4247420	4248980	They announced that on Tuesday.
4248980	4251760	And they have 60 employees.
4251760	4257820	So they have the new Proletariat Workers Alliance
4257820	4260860	and is unionizing with the Communications
4260860	4262980	Workers of America.
4262980	4266240	And they said they have a super majority of support
4266240	4269440	among their qualifying staff at the studio.
4269440	4274840	And let's see what their vision statement says here,
4274840	4275940	what they're looking for.
4278760	4280920	They said, let's see, they want to fight
4280920	4284800	to ensure there are progressive human-first benefits
4284800	4287280	such as flexible PTO policy, remote work
4287280	4289780	as a permanent option, and robust health care,
4289780	4292560	open and transparent communication over compensation,
4292560	4295360	and pushing to pay employees a thriving wage,
4295360	4298200	clear, equitable, and actionable processes
4298200	4300760	and resources for workers to attain their career
4300760	4303080	goals such as professional development,
4303080	4305280	pass to promotion, and raises.
4305280	4307600	Overtime is never mandatory.
4307600	4311600	And refusing doesn't affect performance evaluations.
4311600	4314300	Transparent process by which management and workers
4314300	4318840	can hold each other accountable without fear of retaliation.
4318840	4323480	And a culture and policies prioritize DEI
4323480	4325200	in every level of decision making
4325200	4326920	and support underrepresented groups
4326920	4330760	so that we can build the most diverse and equitable AAA game
4330760	4333520	studio in the country.
4333520	4334520	Cool.
4334520	4337920	And apparently, there hasn't been any pushback on it
4337920	4339440	so far, so.
4339440	4340680	There won't be for Microsoft.
4340680	4342440	They've made it pretty well known.
4342440	4343960	Well, not Microsoft, but you know.
4343960	4346080	Oh, regulatory, right.
4346080	4349840	Well, Activision Blizzard, you know, doing their busting.
4349840	4350920	They have no choice.
4350920	4352240	And they know it.
4352280	4355400	This is where it's going, you know.
4355400	4357000	And because if they were to push back,
4357000	4358840	it could fuck their whole deal with Microsoft.
4358840	4359880	They can't.
4359880	4362840	So it is what I think.
4362840	4364840	And this is going to be the first of many you
4364840	4369440	see this coming year, that's for sure.
4369440	4371880	Yeah, I think I'm surprised it's so few so far,
4371880	4373160	but it's just momentum.
4373160	4375840	Once you see more studios going this route,
4375840	4376960	then more will follow.
4376960	4378240	Yep.
4378240	4380080	All right, well, moving on to our next story.
4380080	4381520	It is the first week of the year,
4381520	4382560	first full week of the year.
4382560	4384280	And that means, of course, Awesome Games Done Quick
4384280	4384760	is back.
4384760	4388440	And Awesome Games Done Quick is doing their 2023 speed run
4388440	4390040	marathon.
4390040	4392960	They're going to be debuting some new speed runs this year,
4392960	4394360	including Stray, Splatoon 3.
4394360	4396560	Of course, a lot of these games just came out, right?
4396560	4398720	Powerwash Simulator, that's going to be interesting.
4398720	4401080	And Neon White, yeah, are all debuting this year.
4401080	4402200	So that's pretty cool.
4402200	4406800	The event runs from today, the 8th, through January 15th.
4406800	4407800	This is all online.
4407840	4410280	You may or may not remember, originally,
4410280	4412840	AGDQ was being looked at for Florida
4412840	4414120	as they had done in the past.
4414120	4415640	And that was the trend in the past.
4415640	4420320	But when Summer Games Done Quick was in person
4420320	4423560	in the Mall of America town in Minnesota,
4423560	4425680	when they did Summer Games Done Quick there,
4425680	4428760	they were taking COVID precautions very seriously,
4428760	4432240	probably to a further extent than you have probably
4432240	4435200	seen probably any other convention at this point do.
4435200	4437120	If you want to go to Bobby Black Wolf's show
4437120	4438760	because he's involved with Games Done Quick
4438760	4439640	with the commentating.
4439640	4442280	And he went, go look for his episode
4442280	4445520	that goes into all the details about how far their COVID
4445520	4446360	procedures went.
4446360	4447920	But you know what?
4447920	4449120	They worked.
4449120	4451800	You know what you didn't hear from Games Done Quick?
4451800	4452880	Any COVID transmission.
4452880	4453720	You didn't hear it.
4453720	4455520	So precautions worked.
4455520	4456960	So they took precautions.
4456960	4459040	So there is that.
4459040	4462880	And it does seem like Florida was not
4462880	4464160	going to allow them, essentially.
4464160	4466600	Long story short, I'm making a long story very, very short.
4466600	4469360	But basically, Florida was not a safe place
4469360	4473560	to have Games Done Quick between their options for COVID
4473560	4476240	and, of course, not just that, but you
4476240	4481120	look at Florida's governor and a lot of the holy crusades
4481120	4482840	he's decided to go on recently.
4482840	4485200	And it's not a safe place for people in other ways.
4485200	4489240	So Games Done Quick, the virtual thing worked.
4489240	4490280	So let's do that.
4490280	4492320	So they're going to do the virtual awesome Games Done
4492320	4493200	Quick.
4493200	4494680	Anyway, some other runs.
4494680	4496600	Cult of the Lamb, they're going to speed run as well.
4496600	4497560	That's interesting.
4497560	4498600	So that's pretty cool.
4498600	4499320	It'd be too hard.
4499320	4500360	Yeah.
4500360	4502760	Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge, Tiger Claw.
4502760	4504720	I'm sure you're going to be watching that.
4504720	4508000	No Elden Ring, unless they're saying perhaps it's a bonus
4508000	4510000	game, but I don't think that was on the schedule.
4510000	4511840	But that's OK, because they mix it up.
4511840	4515160	Of course, AGDQ is raising money for the Prevent Cancer
4515160	4516640	Foundation.
4516640	4521640	2022 raised $3.4 million.
4521640	4523960	And yeah, they've raised over $41 million
4523960	4525800	for charity since 2010.
4525800	4529320	That is very, very cool.
4529320	4532440	Bobby Blackwolf in Chat says, fun fact.
4532440	4536440	Unlike previous events, bits and subs on their Twitch channel
4536440	4540040	do not go to charity, but go toward paying the hotel
4540040	4541320	cancellation fees.
4541320	4542280	Wow.
4542280	4545240	So it shows you how serious they were about this whole thing.
4545240	4548760	So I mean, it's a bummer.
4548760	4549280	You know what?
4549280	4551000	But in a way, the optics of that make
4551000	4553960	it look like the hotel is taking the charity's money.
4553960	4557560	And so it is kind of a smart move by the Game Stunt
4557560	4559960	Quick organization, to be honest.
4559960	4563960	Because the hotel could have opted to just let it go.
4563960	4566360	But I guess I understand there's employees and things
4566360	4567320	like that that they've got to pay.
4567320	4570040	So there's got to be a middle road somewhere.
4570040	4570760	Interesting.
4570760	4572600	As Jordan heard Matt talking about MAGFest,
4572600	4574320	since we're talking about COVID precautions,
4574320	4576040	what does that look like in 2023?
4576040	4578880	MAGFest took precautions very seriously as well this year.
4578880	4581760	Everyone had to be vaxed to masks at all times to enter.
4581760	4584240	And for the most part, everyone followed procedure very well
4584240	4585600	with mild grumbling.
4586160	4586960	Interesting.
4586960	4587600	Very interesting.
4588480	4590800	By the way, speaking of our pal Bobby Black Wolf,
4590800	4591840	I do want to give a shout out.
4591840	4594720	Because as I mentioned, he does commentating for Game Stunt
4594720	4596400	Quick and has for a few years now,
4596400	4598080	ever since they went virtual.
4598080	4599920	Or at least, if not the first one,
4599920	4600800	the one right after that.
4600800	4601840	He's been doing it for a while.
4601840	4604080	And he will be participating with this one as well.
4604080	4607040	If you want to tune in, I don't know how he's going to do it.
4607040	4608560	Because he's going to be back awake.
4609360	4611440	His first shift is coming up overnight.
4611440	4614560	So probably by the time most of you have heard this podcast,
4614560	4616960	you've probably already missed his first shift
4616960	4620560	that took place at 3 o'clock in the morning West Coast time,
4620560	4622320	or 6 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
4622320	4624560	But he'll be commentating for Gun Grave,
4624560	4626720	Armored Core Project Phantasma,
4626720	4629680	Bomberman 64, The Second Attack, and Onimusha 2.
4629680	4631440	Those runs are happening overnight tonight.
4631440	4633200	Well, overnight for us on the West Coast.
4633200	4638400	But this is a great opportunity for you VOG Network folks
4638400	4639280	in Europe.
4639280	4641280	This is very well timed for you.
4641280	4643840	Or even places like Japan and Australia.
4646560	4649600	This is a weird time of the clock for us in the States.
4649600	4652160	But it's a very good time of the clock for those of you
4652160	4652880	in other countries.
4652880	4655200	So if you ever want to hear Bobby Blackwolf do his thing,
4655200	4656640	you get a chance this year.
4656640	4658400	The one you'll probably have a better chance
4658400	4660640	of catching Bobby at will be Thursday
4660640	4662560	at 3.30 in the morning our time,
4662560	4664240	6.30 in the morning East Coast time.
4665360	4667760	He's going to be closing out the awful block
4667760	4669440	with bad guys at school.
4670000	4672240	And Steven Seagal is the final option.
4673200	4674080	Oh, geez.
4674080	4677120	Which apparently has a lot of lulls behind it.
4677120	4679600	So that's why that's the one that's closing out the block.
4679600	4682480	And then he also gets to do a Mega Man ZX speedrun
4682480	4684960	as they transition back into the less awful games
4685680	4687040	part of the show there.
4687040	4689600	And that is all overnight for us on Thursday.
4689600	4691520	But again, for Europe, that's what?
4691520	4692320	Add five hours.
4692320	4693840	That's practically noon time.
4693840	4694400	He'll probably be.
4694400	4696160	I mean, there's always delays and things like that,
4696160	4700160	but practically noon time for folks in GMT.
4700160	4702080	So pretty cool.
4702640	4703360	Good luck, Bobby.
4704160	4707200	All right, let us move on.
4707200	4708880	Darsakha, you hinted at this earlier.
4710160	4710560	Yeah.
4710560	4715840	So now people weren't really believing it at first
4715840	4720480	until DBD leaks put out something.
4720480	4723760	And DBD leaks for anyone who follows Dead by Daylight,
4724400	4729760	they are some of the most reliable people for any news
4729760	4732560	about what's going to be going on in Dead by Daylight.
4734160	4737440	They've shown outfits before they're released.
4737440	4741600	They've given, you know, like the advent calendar.
4741600	4743360	I think they knew it before it was released,
4743360	4744240	all of this business.
4744960	4752480	So the PTB, the public test beta files are out
4752480	4754320	and people, of course, data miners
4754320	4755760	are going to look for whatever they can.
4758400	4763920	So they were finding that his three perks,
4763920	4768080	which I mean, they're very specific names.
4768080	4771200	It's what Franklin's demise, barbecue and chili,
4771200	4775600	and why can't I think of the other one?
4775600	4776000	Knockout.
4776000	4776880	Yeah, the one I don't use.
4778240	4780480	But I mean, but two of them specifically
4780480	4784160	are named after, you know, things important to the movie.
4784800	4789280	So there are now, there were screenshots floating around
4789280	4793680	of it saying like, I have to find a picture for it again,
4793680	4797040	but it's like replacement, barbecue and chili, blah, blah,
4797040	4798880	blah, rare perk.
4798880	4801040	Whereas if it's specific to a character,
4802000	4803760	it would say like rare, the cannibal perk.
4805520	4807760	I am going to point out those saying
4807760	4810160	that the stranger things characters,
4810160	4812080	even though their perks were changed,
4812080	4816400	it still has, for me at least, Demogorgon perk,
4816400	4818400	Nancy perk, you know, stuff like that,
4818400	4820160	even though they are supposed to be generics
4820160	4821680	and act like generics.
4821680	4824880	But that's the rumor of what's going on with Bubba's perks.
4825760	4829440	What that means is that the theory
4829440	4834000	is that behavior is going to be losing the license
4834000	4836000	for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,
4836000	4838320	which as I recall, isn't it,
4838320	4841600	wasn't that their first licensed character was Bubba?
4841600	4843200	Myers was, then they got Bubba.
4843200	4845040	Myers was, that's right, Myers was.
4846880	4848960	But at any rate, you know,
4848960	4852240	but this is the character that inspired the game.
4852240	4854640	I mean, the whole meat hook thing,
4854640	4857040	that came from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
4857040	4862240	I mean, they even had a character based off of Leatherface,
4862240	4865120	you know, the hillbilly who ran around with a chainsaw
4865760	4867360	and, you know, grunted a lot.
4869920	4874720	Now, the other thing that gives a little bit more evidence
4874720	4882480	to this is that in pulling the actual data for it,
4885120	4889920	they have also that they're listed as Perk Barbecue Chili
4889920	4891440	underscore name underscore alt.
4891440	4895520	So that's indicating that particular piece of change.
4896240	4899200	There is, hold on, it's going to be one other thing.
4899200	4900880	I've got to find my other resource
4900880	4902400	because I forgot to link it to you.
4905440	4908880	It's actually this, I don't want to play the YouTube video,
4908880	4910640	but it's got the screenshot that I need in it.
4911280	4916640	It's one of the videos I follow,
4916640	4918960	and he's been completely full of crap before,
4918960	4920080	but is Mint Skull.
4927040	4929440	There is, he had a screenshot also
4929440	4933040	of some of the code for the licensed characters.
4933760	4937120	And the piece of the code for the licensed character
4937680	4942480	is that next to leather faces, it says license expire true.
4944560	4946320	And if you look at other licensed characters,
4946320	4947360	like they checked ash.
4949120	4952000	Next to ash, it was license expire false.
4953280	4961440	So in the end, they're probably going to end up doing with Bubba
4961440	4964960	what they did, what they're doing with the stranger things.
4965440	4967200	The stranger things content,
4967200	4970720	where the character is going to be removed for purchase.
4972000	4973840	He will still be in the game,
4975280	4977840	but if you have not already purchased him
4977840	4979520	and all of his cosmetics,
4980400	4982640	you will not be able to get him again.
4983280	4987360	And the going theory is that it's due to the,
4988880	4991840	the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game that's coming out.
4991840	4993840	I mean, that was sort of what happened
4994800	4998800	with Stranger Things content.
4999760	5001840	Although, I mean, the rumors have been floating around
5001840	5003440	about Stranger Things coming back,
5003440	5005040	but some of that was disproven.
5005040	5006320	I was going to say that's the one thing
5006320	5008800	that DBD Leaks thus far has gotten wrong
5008800	5011760	is the DBD Leaks was on this Vecna.
5014720	5016640	There was reason to believe it,
5016640	5021200	but those ended up being fan-made renders.
5021200	5023120	Oh, cause I was gonna say, to be fair,
5023840	5025600	and it looked legit.
5025600	5027520	It could be the next DLC
5027520	5029120	because they were saying it was going to be
5029120	5030640	around the time the night came out,
5030640	5032080	but it could just be as simple as
5032640	5034880	Behavior didn't want to do two licenses back to back
5034880	5036160	cause they had just done Resident Evil.
5036160	5037120	And I don't think they've ever done
5037120	5038240	two licenses back to back.
5038240	5041440	So it could just, you know,
5041440	5042880	there's a lot of things that could happen,
5042880	5044800	but it could be that the Stranger Things happened
5044800	5046800	just comes back with Vecna.
5046800	5049280	And I think they were saying Joyce would be at all
5049280	5050240	for Nancy or whatever.
5050240	5050480	I don't know.
5050480	5051760	It could be all fan-wank, who knows,
5052320	5055600	but that that would all hit the game in the next.
5055600	5058720	We get the cop guy, who I can never remember his name.
5058720	5060960	Oh, Dommer.
5060960	5062320	We could give him him and Joyce.
5062320	5063360	That would be cool.
5063360	5064160	It would be cool,
5064160	5064720	but I think that,
5064720	5066720	weren't they saying Eddie for the male killer?
5066720	5067680	Or not male, I'm sorry.
5067680	5068800	Male survivor would be Eddie.
5069520	5070000	Maybe.
5070000	5070720	Maybe.
5070720	5071840	We need Barb back.
5072640	5075520	But Hopper, thank you.
5075520	5077920	Why would they say Dommer?
5077920	5078720	You know what though?
5078720	5080800	Is it like if they did bring it back,
5080800	5082240	would they bring back Hawkins?
5082880	5087200	So I need to go load up my Windows partition
5087200	5089200	so that I can rip the content
5089760	5091920	and see if the Hawkins map is still,
5091920	5095520	because all up until a couple of PTBs ago,
5095520	5096560	at least to my knowledge,
5096560	5098640	because I haven't gone for files since then,
5100000	5102160	the maps and assets for Hawkins
5102160	5103920	was still in the game files.
5105280	5105920	Of course, also.
5107120	5107840	Oh, I was just to say,
5108720	5110240	I do want to point out,
5110240	5111840	because you had also pointed this out to me
5111840	5112400	and I did go,
5112400	5113040	Oh yeah.
5113040	5113760	Is that, you know,
5113760	5115520	with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game,
5115520	5116000	you know,
5116000	5117840	it makes a lot of sense why this is happening.
5117840	5119440	Stranger Things games,
5119440	5120080	those,
5120080	5121360	I think at this point,
5121360	5122960	they were probably making more money
5122960	5124400	from the Dead by Daylight thing
5124400	5125920	than they were from those Stranger Things games.
5125920	5129920	So Netflix is probably come around on that finally.
5129920	5131520	But you did make a good point.
5131520	5134240	You said when the Evil Dead game came out,
5134240	5135200	they didn't pull Ash.
5136320	5138000	Because Bruce Campbell likes money.
5138640	5139440	I mean,
5139440	5141600	I'm going to be flat out about this.
5141600	5142880	That's true.
5143840	5146720	Back when I saw The Man with the Screaming Brain,
5146720	5149840	which was a really crappy movie he was in,
5149840	5153360	he was there at the Crest.
5154320	5156320	And he was like,
5156320	5156640	yeah,
5156640	5159200	this movie here paid for my roof.
5159200	5161600	This movie here got my kids braces,
5162240	5162720	you know,
5163360	5164800	and I was like,
5164960	5165520	I was like,
5165520	5167840	I don't see Bruce Campbell
5167840	5169760	not allowing his likeness to be used
5169760	5172640	for anything related to Ash.
5173680	5177280	So that's just Bruce.
5177920	5178400	That's just,
5179280	5179680	yeah,
5179680	5180080	you know,
5180080	5180880	Bruce Campbell.
5180880	5182720	He likes money.
5183280	5185200	And I think it could be a timing thing, too,
5185200	5186400	is that these license agreements
5186400	5189120	are probably locked in for about five years.
5189120	5192160	And we're probably past the five years.
5192160	5194080	And now you have this Texas Chainsaw Massacre game
5194080	5194480	coming out.
5194480	5195360	It doesn't add up good.
5196240	5198000	It was probably less for Stranger Things
5198000	5198400	because, you know,
5198400	5199920	it's got different kind of IP.
5199920	5202400	But I don't think Ash has been in the game
5203040	5204880	more than two years at this point.
5204880	5207840	So probably even isn't playing then.
5207840	5208000	Yeah.
5208000	5209600	Even if Evil Dead was coming out
5209600	5210400	is probably one of those things
5210400	5211680	where they were locked into contracts
5211680	5212240	still anyway.
5212240	5212880	So who knows?
5213840	5215280	Locopoco in chat says it's sad
5215280	5216480	that the license is going to go away,
5216480	5218240	but the license stuff was never guaranteed
5218240	5220320	to stay forever as much as we wanted it.
5220320	5221680	When DVD came to Switch,
5221680	5223920	they had to renegotiate Freddy's chapter
5223920	5225280	because it wasn't available with it
5225280	5226000	when it released.
5226000	5226720	That's a good point.
5226720	5227760	I didn't realize that.
5228640	5230400	You know what I would like to see, though,
5230400	5232000	like as a surprise?
5232000	5235200	I would like to see a classic Freddy chapter.
5235840	5236320	Oh, yeah.
5236320	5239520	Where we where we get like,
5241200	5243680	like, say, we get Elm Street as a map,
5243680	5244720	you know, with the house
5245360	5247600	in the center intact and everything,
5247600	5249680	kind of like the Myers house.
5249680	5250960	I mean, that would be too many things
5250960	5252000	that are exactly the same.
5252000	5254000	Or we have something like Hawkins.
5254560	5258240	You could easily translate the Hawkins map
5258240	5261040	into a big boiler room, you know?
5262080	5263200	Yes to all of that.
5263200	5265280	But literally just Nancy is enough.
5265280	5266880	Like, literally just Nancy
5266880	5268880	would make so many people happy.
5270240	5272560	If they did bring out Nancy, though,
5272560	5275200	I would also want Alice.
5276000	5278000	Sorry, I'm team Alice in this.
5278560	5279040	Fair enough.
5279280	5281200	Um, but yeah, I and you know,
5281920	5282400	there's, you know,
5282400	5283760	I watched some of those YouTubes
5283760	5285040	you sent me a little later,
5285040	5286240	and some person was kind of going off
5286240	5287600	about how the loss of this license
5287600	5289360	is so devastating because it kind of ruins.
5289360	5289840	Oh, yeah.
5290400	5292480	That was the multiple video, right?
5292480	5293840	I don't know the whole.
5293840	5295040	It's interesting how people make
5295040	5296480	five minute YouTube videos out of two.
5296480	5297600	But here we are with the three hour
5297600	5298560	podcasts or whatever.
5299360	5302000	So Turnabout's fair play.
5302960	5305360	So it's just how how horrible
5305360	5306320	it was going to be for the whole,
5306320	5308160	like multiverse of horror thing.
5308240	5309120	And I'm kind of like,
5309120	5311520	look, the game still doesn't have Jason.
5311520	5313920	So it's not like it really has everything.
5313920	5315520	And I kind of I kind of think
5316160	5318560	if DBD ever gets Jason,
5318560	5320320	that's the note you go out on.
5320320	5322400	Like, we got them all there.
5322400	5324000	There ain't no more done.
5324640	5325280	You know, even though
5325280	5326480	as long as that game prints money,
5326480	5327920	they're still going to keep making DLC for it.
5327920	5329600	But I feel like once you have Jason,
5330160	5332320	because the Friday the 13th game
5332320	5334000	has got to be over five years old at this point.
5334000	5335120	So I have no idea
5335120	5336240	where those licenses sit.
5336240	5337360	I know it's messy.
5337360	5339120	But heaven forbid they can work that out.
5339120	5340480	Jason coming to Dead by Daylight
5340480	5342160	would be fucking huge, to put it lightly.
5343200	5344960	And that's it.
5344960	5347120	You don't you don't get any bigger license
5347120	5348400	for DBD than Jason.
5348400	5349760	And that's the note you go out on,
5349760	5350400	to be honest.
5353920	5356720	Would like to see Jason in the game,
5357360	5358640	you know, which honestly,
5360240	5363840	Trapper in my esteem is the
5365120	5366400	the answer to Jason.
5366400	5369200	Yeah, be a mask cleaver,
5369200	5370000	that kind of stuff.
5373040	5375040	So, yeah, we'll see.
5375040	5375280	All right.
5375280	5375680	We'll see.
5376800	5377200	All right.
5377200	5378000	Well, moving on.
5378000	5380240	One place you can play Dead by Daylight
5380240	5382000	is on your PlayStation.
5382000	5384880	And Sony had a lot to say at CES.
5384880	5386560	We have yet to say it during the show,
5386560	5388880	but Consumer Electronics Show was this week.
5388880	5392480	And usually the CES is more for
5392480	5394240	literally consumer electronics.
5394480	5396720	E3 was kind of spun off from CES
5396720	5397920	to be specifically about,
5397920	5400160	you know, electronic entertainment.
5400160	5402640	CES is like new TVs.
5402640	5405520	Megan dolls would fit in really great at CES.
5405520	5407680	Arcade 1up usually announces things at CES.
5407680	5408640	We'll get to that in a minute.
5408640	5411840	But Sony sometimes does things at CES
5411840	5414720	because remember all the other crap Sony does.
5414720	5416320	And I say that would love all the other crap,
5416320	5419040	like TVs, sound, movies.
5419040	5421680	You know, Sony does get into consumer electronics.
5421680	5422320	Yes.
5422320	5424160	So they had some things to say at CES.
5424160	5424720	Right, Loki?
5425360	5425600	Yeah.
5425600	5427920	They talked a little bit about PlayStation
5427920	5429520	and announced a few things.
5429520	5431520	So one of the things that they announced
5431520	5433520	is a brand new controller.
5434080	5437600	That's this Project Leonardo.
5437600	5440560	And it is almost it's similar
5440560	5442160	to the adaptive controller
5442160	5444720	that Microsoft put out of.
5444720	5446160	Well, now it's like four years ago.
5447520	5451280	It looks like two spherical portions
5451280	5454480	of a controller with different buttons on each one.
5454480	5456320	Or I should say they're almost like paddles.
5456320	5459440	They're really large and slightly customizable.
5459440	5460320	I got to say, though,
5460320	5461920	it doesn't look as customizable
5461920	5463440	as the adaptive controller like that.
5463440	5468160	You could really do like any possible thing you want with.
5468160	5470320	This looks a little bit more constrained,
5470320	5473920	but at least it's a step in the right direction
5473920	5477520	to add some more accessibility to the PlayStation 5.
5478240	5482560	And I'm not sure where it's going to be coming out
5482560	5485520	or when it's coming out for how much or whatever,
5485520	5488480	but it is something at least that they showed off.
5488480	5489200	So that's cool.
5489200	5491520	That's something in the right direction.
5493120	5495280	Also announced that the PlayStation 5
5495280	5498000	is surpassed 30 million units sold,
5498000	5500880	which is surprising considering we couldn't get one
5500880	5502480	and they were sold out everywhere.
5504080	5506800	So I guess they're moving units.
5506800	5508000	So that's good.
5508000	5511120	OK, but Loki, the lie detector test
5513120	5514800	on where to get those units.
5514800	5515600	I don't know about that.
5517680	5520080	Yeah, well, they're saying that it's going to be
5522080	5523520	readily available this year.
5525120	5526960	We'll see if that actually ends up happening.
5527520	5531040	But because they've had unprecedented demand,
5531040	5533120	they say for the console in the last two years,
5533920	5535600	that's why it sold so many.
5535600	5536960	And this is globally, of course.
5537520	5538000	Let's see.
5538000	5540320	So PlayStation 5's in stock.
5540320	5540880	Let's see.
5541840	5545600	Not there, not there, not there, not there, not there.
5546160	5549600	Gee, I can't find one within 50 miles of here at a target.
5549600	5551920	So I'm going to say that was a lie.
5553440	5555520	Well, yeah, they're saying that's going to be this year.
5555520	5558080	So I'm assuming that you got to give them
5558080	5559280	a little bit of time here.
5559280	5562880	But they've basically in December,
5562880	5565280	they said that they've resolved their supply issues
5565520	5566880	in Asian territories.
5569600	5572800	But yet I don't know if it's necessarily overcome
5572800	5573840	that everywhere else.
5574720	5576000	So we'll have to wait and see.
5577040	5578320	But that's what they're saying.
5578320	5580480	I mean, they can always they could say that now.
5580480	5583280	And then three months from now, they could just be like,
5583280	5587440	oh, yeah, well, whoops, we I guess we're just so popular
5587440	5591280	that I just sold out, you know, so we'll just spin it that way.
5591280	5592880	All right, well, back to the good news
5592880	5594720	about the accessibility controller.
5594720	5597280	As to 100 Matt says, I'm so glad that Sony partnered
5597280	5599920	with a lot of organizations, including able gamers,
5599920	5602720	making games more accessible for everyone makes gaming
5602720	5604560	better and more gamers.
5604560	5605520	Yes, to all of that.
5606640	5608960	That is a very good announcement out of consumer electronic
5608960	5609840	show for sure.
5609840	5612880	The other part of what they said to be determined,
5612880	5615520	but I'm not sure I believe him yet.
5615520	5616160	But we'll see.
5616160	5616560	We'll see.
5616560	5618560	They sure seem confident what they're saying.
5618560	5621840	And again, I don't I don't see how the PlayStation VR 2
5621840	5623680	can sell a lot of units if there's not a lot of,
5624480	5625200	units out there.
5625200	5628320	But anyway, moving on, let's talk about some news
5628320	5630240	from arcade one up out of CES.
5630240	5633760	As I mentioned, they tend to show new machines and so forth
5633760	5636320	at consumer electronic show, and a little bit out of left
5636320	5637440	field for their new machine.
5637440	5640080	Their new machine they announced is a Wheel of Fortune
5640080	5641040	casino Cade.
5642160	5644720	So a lot of us, you know, the collect the classic arcade
5644720	5648640	machines kind of look at that and go, huh, what, why?
5649520	5651440	But let's be real.
5651440	5654400	It is a market that is untapped yet.
5654400	5658000	And there would be fans of casino games and yet they exist
5658800	5660800	that would be interested in this kind of thing when they
5660800	5664640	may not be as interested in a Tron or a Burger Time machine
5664640	5667200	or whatever, you know, arcade one up you can think of.
5667200	5669840	So it is expanding there are attempting to expand their
5669840	5670640	audience.
5670640	5671680	So it's interesting.
5671680	5674400	But certainly I look at a Wheel of Fortune arcade one up
5674400	5675520	and I go not for me.
5676560	5678960	But you know, the sights and sounds of casino.
5679920	5683280	I have a friend that's very interested in collecting these
5683280	5687760	types of casino collectibles, because that's what he likes.
5687760	5691360	And so there are people that do enjoy the fake casino
5691360	5691760	experience.
5691760	5697520	I mean, would they keep making poker, blackjack slot machine
5697520	5701120	games for Android and iOS if people weren't eating them up?
5701120	5703920	So there's a lot of people that like the fake casino stuff.
5703920	5706240	So a lot of people like the real stuff too.
5706240	5707600	But there's a market for this.
5707680	5709040	I just don't think it's any of us.
5709760	5712080	But there's that.
5712080	5715840	However, maybe a little more up our alley, the arcade one up
5715840	5717360	infinity game board.
5717360	5720880	So that's, it's basically like a giant tablet, but a little
5720880	5723520	more firm, you know, a little more for game night that, you
5723520	5725680	know, you can play like a virtual Uno and things like that
5725680	5726180	on.
5726400	5729440	But as far as like the machine collectibles, they're going
5729440	5731280	to be doing some more deluxe machines.
5731280	5733280	So those are the full size arcade machines.
5733280	5736720	They did Killer Instinct, I think was the big one at CES
5736720	5737440	last year.
5737440	5739760	So they're even bigger than the ones behind me because
5739760	5742320	technically these are three quarters size on a riser.
5742320	5747120	So the deluxe ones are like true original arcade size.
5747120	5750160	So there's going to be a Mortal Kombat deluxe with Mortal
5750160	5752080	Kombat 2 branding all over it.
5752080	5756880	But that includes most of the Midway stuff from the 80s or
5756880	5758560	90s, 80s around that era.
5758560	5760960	There's also going to be a Pac-Man deluxe, which is basically
5760960	5763680	your Namco greatest hits, you know, your Mappy and so forth.
5764320	5766000	There's also going to be a Ms.
5766000	5767280	Pac-Man deluxe.
5767280	5770480	So they've got those rights issues sorted out where Ms.
5770480	5772080	Pac-Man and Pac-Man are both available.
5772880	5776720	And a class of 81 deluxe, which is the one that split on
5776720	5777280	how it looks.
5777280	5778000	It's got Ms.
5778000	5782400	Pac-Man and Galaga in it as there was a famous arcade machine
5782400	5785120	called Class of 81 that was just like that.
5785120	5786240	It had him split there.
5786240	5787760	So, yeah, it's funny.
5787760	5791440	Like I read that wrong at first and I thought it had 81 games
5791440	5793760	and I'm like, dang, the friendly stepping up.
5793760	5794800	No, no, no.
5795120	5798000	In fact, I think Class of 81 deluxe might literally only
5798000	5799120	have those two games.
5799120	5802480	I don't think it has much more, but the other ones are.
5802480	5803280	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
5803280	5804320	I stand corrected.
5804320	5808960	12 games in Class of 81, but I don't see a list, at least
5808960	5810480	not readily available for me to grab.
5810480	5814800	But generally these things tend to be like a best of, you
5814800	5817200	know, Namco type of thing.
5817200	5819440	You know, whoever the company is on there.
5819440	5821840	So looking in chat.
5822480	5825520	Orange Riot is talking about the casino going, my parents
5825520	5827920	love the fake slot machine games on Facebook.
5827920	5828480	Yeah.
5828480	5831600	And the interesting thing is, I mean, I don't know how recently
5831600	5834880	any of you have been to a casino, but if you think casinos
5834880	5838560	now are still pull the lever and that whole thing.
5838560	5842240	Like, yeah, those games are still there, but that is not
5842240	5843280	the majority of games.
5843280	5845680	The majority of casino slot machine games now are like
5845680	5848160	touch screen type of things where all the slots are there.
5848160	5850480	And then the bonus round is a touch game.
5850560	5852640	And that's what they're going for with this Wheel of Fortune
5852640	5855120	thing, because they're kind of trying to gamify something
5855120	5858400	that's a little harder to gamify, because I think they're
5858400	5862160	actually putting puzzles in it, which don't exist in the
5862160	5863760	actual Wheel of Fortune slot machine.
5864400	5865760	But okay, whatever.
5865760	5866260	So.
5866720	5867280	Oh, thank you.
5867280	5871520	Orange Riot says the 12 games in the Class of 81 are Ms.
5871520	5876320	Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaga 88, Galaxian, Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2,
5876320	5880400	Mappy, Rally X, Rolling Thunder, Rompers, Tower of Draga,
5880400	5881520	King and Balloon.
5881520	5884880	See, those games have all been in before, except I think
5884880	5886560	Rompers and King and Balloon.
5886560	5889760	I think now they're digging deeper, which it's weird that
5889760	5895520	they don't do things like, what the fuck was the dragon game
5895520	5897680	that was in every Namco collection?
5898720	5902160	Oh, my God, you're riding on the backs of dragons.
5902160	5902960	It's a shooting game.
5902960	5907200	Why am I completely blanking right now?
5907200	5908160	Dragon Spirit.
5908800	5909760	Yeah, Dragon Spirit.
5909760	5910320	I beat chat.
5910320	5911200	I beat chat.
5911200	5912080	I beat it.
5912080	5914320	Dragon Spirit delay, delay.
5916080	5918480	But I'm kind of surprised I'm not putting stuff like that
5918480	5918960	in there.
5918960	5919360	So, yeah.
5919360	5920720	And Fenaris is Joust.
5920720	5924000	Joust isn't Namco, but I believe Joust is on that Mortal
5924000	5926000	Combat Cabinet, because that's in the classic Midway.
5928000	5929440	So, oh, sorry.
5929440	5930480	Rama's right.
5930480	5932000	You're not riding on the back of the dragon.
5932000	5933040	You are the dragon.
5933040	5935840	See, I got it mixed up with the Dreamcast thing.
5935840	5939520	But anyway, I know I'm literally firing myself.
5939520	5941360	All right, moving on.
5942160	5942880	Where are we at?
5942880	5943120	Are we?
5944800	5946080	Who has this next story?
5946640	5947120	Is it me?
5950640	5953760	Oh, I missed a story in the sidebar.
5953760	5955840	So I was like, what is wrong here?
5955840	5956320	Yes.
5956320	5958800	Dark Soccer, you're actually next with a story that is not
5958800	5959600	on our sidebar.
5959600	5960160	Sorry about that.
5961120	5961620	Oh.
5963280	5963920	User error.
5963920	5964160	Oh, gosh.
5965440	5965940	Yeah.
5966640	5969120	And I was so focused on Debbie.
5969920	5973360	So at any rate, Atari is announcing a new handheld,
5973360	5975680	a mini arcade in-home console.
5976400	5978640	It looks weird and kind of retro.
5980000	5983680	It's the Atari and My Arcade releasing
5983680	5985760	these three collaborations.
5986560	5990720	So we have the My Arcade Atari Micro Player,
5990720	5995760	which looks like a desktop, a tabletop arcade cabinet.
5996560	6004720	And then we have the My Arcade Atari Pocket Player,
6004720	6006480	little handheld dedicated.
6006480	6008640	I mean, you've seen the My Arcades at the store.
6008640	6009840	They have a lot of them like that.
6009840	6010340	Yeah.
6011280	6013440	Well, no, I'm talking about the little personal
6013440	6014560	handheld gameplay.
6014560	6015360	Those I don't have.
6015840	6018560	I have the little arcade replicas, but yeah.
6018560	6019060	Yeah.
6019060	6020400	And I've got a bunch of those too,
6020400	6021440	at least the ones that are good.
6022640	6027280	And then the last one is the My Arcade Atari Game Station Plus
6027280	6032240	that actually reminds me in coloration of the Atari 7800
6032880	6039360	and a little sort of retro futuristic looking joysticks
6039360	6041520	that have extra buttons and twisties on them.
6042240	6047440	So, and they did clarify that it will include a collection
6047440	6051680	of games from the 2600, 7800 and the arcade.
6051680	6053200	What about the 5200?
6053200	6054560	The best games are the 50.
6054560	6055120	Fuck them.
6055120	6055680	No, I'm just kidding.
6056560	6057060	I'm pissed.
6059440	6060560	But at any rate.
6060560	6062720	It looks better than a flashback does.
6063760	6064960	It's a nice looking thing.
6066080	6068720	So we'll see what they're like when they come out.
6069600	6070720	I'll reserve some judgment.
6072320	6074880	Better this than that VCS computer or whatever the hell
6074880	6076480	they were trying two years ago.
6076480	6077600	It was silly.
6077600	6078160	Yeah.
6078160	6078660	Right.
6079520	6080400	All right.
6080400	6082160	Now that my brain is back on track,
6082160	6083760	Loki, what do you have for us?
6084720	6085220	Yes.
6086000	6088000	So it's kind of cool.
6088720	6090560	We've got this story.
6090560	6093280	We talked about this, I think a little bit ago where there
6093280	6098640	was a DMCA takedown of Did You Know Gaming's video on the
6098640	6103200	Heroes of Hyrule, which was a work in progress game that
6103200	6105200	never made it to the DS.
6105200	6107360	But it was supposed to be coming out on the Nintendo DS,
6107360	6109120	kind of a tactics Zelda game.
6109920	6114320	And it was taken down by, I think, Nintendo themselves.
6115040	6122080	But they have, I guess, worked with or fought against it
6122080	6128720	with YouTube, and now it has been able to be put back up.
6128720	6131040	They were able to win their case, I guess.
6131600	6133360	So that's cool.
6133360	6136240	And we get to actually see some information about this
6136240	6140320	unpublished game that Nintendo, I guess, didn't want us
6140320	6140820	knowing about.
6141840	6144800	The only thing that irritates me about all of this is that
6144800	6145840	thank you, Madeline.
6145840	6147280	Sorry, off screen.
6147920	6149040	Nice husband bringing me a drink.
6149760	6153520	So the only thing that is disappointing about this is that
6153520	6154880	Nintendo ought to get a strike.
6155680	6157040	That's the way this should work.
6157680	6161200	These companies claim things that there isn't their right
6161200	6161840	to claim.
6161840	6163040	They should get a strike.
6163040	6165440	But that's not how YouTube is set up, unfortunately.
6166160	6166660	Right.
6167600	6170800	Basically, they did a DMCA takedown.
6170800	6171760	He counter noticed.
6171760	6176240	So if they said countered again, then they would get a
6176320	6179840	strike on the channel, and they would have to go to court
6179840	6180340	over this.
6181440	6184000	But they never, I guess, responded.
6184640	6185140	So.
6185840	6188960	And Nintendo, you do not want that court case.
6188960	6192320	I mean, I know Nintendo is a big, scary company, but this
6192320	6195360	is the type of thing, this video, and maybe Nintendo could
6195360	6196480	read the tea leaves on this.
6197040	6200320	This is the type of thing that catches fire on Reddit.
6201040	6204080	And some fucking lawyer goes, I'll do it pro bono to stick
6204080	6205280	it in Nintendo on this.
6205840	6208880	And this is the type of thing that just Nintendo doesn't
6208880	6209360	want this.
6210640	6212960	It was a mistake for them to do this in the first place.
6212960	6215360	And maybe this is their way of quietly admitting that.
6216160	6219520	But Nintendo is smart to not pursue this any further.
6220480	6220960	Exactly.
6220960	6223760	Because it's not like it was a project that they're working
6223760	6225520	on right now, as far as we're aware.
6226800	6229200	It's not something that they would be embarrassed by.
6229200	6231760	It's just something that they never made.
6231760	6233360	They decided not to go with it.
6233360	6236080	Well, and there's so much precedent out there where it's
6236080	6239680	like, we've seen documentaries about movies that were not
6239680	6244240	made, lost TV pilots that were never meant to actually be
6244240	6247840	on air that, you know, end up getting like the whole, like,
6247840	6251040	documentary of things that didn't happen, especially after
6251040	6252480	a certain statute of limitations.
6252480	6255120	Like, again, it's not like this game was scheduled to come
6255120	6255840	out this year.
6255840	6258960	It was supposed to come out in the DS era, right?
6258960	6262720	So like, like, damn near 20 years ago, at least 15 years
6262720	6267520	ago. So it's like, it's not worth it to Nintendo to fight
6267520	6270560	this. And, you know, then, of course, the internet is quick
6270560	6273040	to label everything Streisand effect these days.
6273040	6277280	But in part, yes, I guarantee you now more people have seen
6277280	6278160	that documentary.
6278960	6280400	Nintendo ultimately lost this.
6280400	6286960	More people saw that documentary because gaming, journalism,
6286960	6291440	social media all put that YouTube link this week in announcing
6291440	6292000	that it's back.
6292720	6294320	That's all these hits now.
6295280	6296160	There it is.
6296160	6299360	Tiger class says, remember Star Fox 2, a game that was never
6299360	6301760	supposed to be released, but eventually did get released.
6301760	6305520	Well, yes, that's a little different because Nintendo kind
6305520	6306960	of put that out themselves.
6306960	6310720	So it's not really like, but I mean, maybe I could read into
6310720	6315920	that is that maybe Nintendo wanted to do a DS classic someday
6315920	6318160	and put the canceled Zelda game in it.
6318160	6319920	And maybe they're a little worried about that.
6319920	6323760	I mean, that's the only thing where you might be able to
6323760	6327920	go. Oh, that's why they did it.
6329600	6333760	But again, I think they did more damage to their cause because
6333760	6335920	now everybody's copy post pasting that link.
6336720	6339680	But Tiger Clay, you do bring up an interesting parallel is
6339680	6342800	that just because the game got canceled doesn't mean it's
6342800	6343920	canceled forever.
6343920	6348480	You know, and I could very much see a DS classic as something
6348560	6351840	Nintendo does in the future is so weird to think that that's
6351840	6353040	where we're at.
6353040	6356240	But a little a cheap little DS handheld doesn't have to even
6356240	6356800	be 3DS.
6356800	6361440	A cheap little DS handheld with, like, 25 games preloaded
6361440	6362960	onto it would be huge.
6364560	6365680	And I bet Nintendo does.
6365680	6368480	I there may be more.
6368480	6370000	Yeah, VG realness.
6370000	6370720	Hi, friend.
6370720	6372880	In chat says, temper your expectations.
6372880	6373680	It's Nintendo.
6373680	6374560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6374560	6375520	Bring me down to Earth.
6375520	6379040	But I feel like a DS classic could be a thing, but maybe
6379040	6380960	not before we have a Game Boy classic.
6380960	6381680	We still need it.
6381680	6383680	Like, if they want to do something real fucking cheap,
6383680	6384240	do it.
6384240	6385440	Don't even backlight it.
6385440	6389280	Do a classic 90s brick fucking Game Boy.
6390400	6392720	Of course, the Tetris license might be a challenge to them.
6392720	6394640	Do you think they dare put something like that out without
6394640	6396320	Tetris? I don't know.
6396320	6398240	Yes, maybe.
6398960	6399440	Anyway.
6399440	6402160	All right, let's move on.
6403840	6404960	Let's talk about Konami.
6405760	6412640	And Konami is teasing more stuff for the year 2023, not
6412640	6415840	just their Silent Hill stuff, but new developments for
6415840	6416720	familiar series.
6416720	6418800	And I don't even think this means they're arcade stuff.
6419840	6423760	So this is the year of the rabbit.
6424480	6427840	So we are planning power ups and new developments for familiar
6427840	6431280	series with the aiming of leaping even further.
6431280	6433040	This is a quote from Famitsu.
6434000	6437200	Additionally, we're deeply and quietly progressing on new
6437200	6440240	projects that we have yet to announce to you all.
6440240	6442160	Konami is leaping forward.
6443120	6444800	What a strange tie in.
6444800	6448560	So by all means, keep bringing Frogger up.
6448560	6453840	Well, you probably because I was like, like, time pilot,
6453840	6455040	like, leaping forward in time.
6455040	6456960	No, it's probably fucking Frogger game.
6456960	6457840	That's a Frogger game.
6458720	6459520	Good job, Loki.
6460240	6461120	You ruin everything.
6461680	6465360	All right, you're probably right, though.
6466000	6468640	Okay, so we're going to get to our next segment.
6468640	6472160	Before I roll the segment, because Dark Sakura has already
6472160	6473360	put this together for us.
6473360	6475920	I do want to quickly mention about the 2020.
6475920	6477200	I still need to talk over it.
6478000	6479360	Oh, I thought this was.
6480080	6482400	I told you my audio got lost last night.
6482400	6483120	Oh, my bad.
6483120	6483840	My bad.
6483840	6486960	Well, then quickly, before we roll it, I want to talk about
6486960	6491600	the 2023 twist, because we kind of threw out a few things.
6491600	6494320	So of course, the classic game of the week is the segment
6494320	6496480	we do every week here on Orange Zones Radio.
6498320	6502560	But ever since what, like 2017, maybe 2016, I'd have to go
6502560	6503520	check on the wiki.
6503520	6506720	But you've been mixing it up for a while now is that one
6507600	6510400	month out of the year, you will do a different category.
6511280	6514560	Previous categories have included classic 8-bit soundtracks,
6515520	6516880	classic pinball machines.
6517600	6522320	And just last year we was that peripherals and consoles.
6522320	6524560	Flag was a personal favorite of mine.
6524560	6527840	But this last year we did classic electronic handhelds.
6528720	6532240	This year, what is the new category officially?
6532240	6534160	Because we've thrown a few ideas out there, but officially,
6534160	6535760	what is our new category for 2023?
6536400	6538560	Classic non-video game games.
6539920	6540560	All right.
6540560	6543440	And what defines a non-video game game?
6544320	6546400	It's a game that isn't a video game.
6546400	6546880	Perfect.
6546880	6547200	All right.
6549440	6551680	Quote it, print it, put it on the back of the box.
6551680	6554800	That being said, let's get to the segment.
6565360	6568640	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where
6568640	6572240	I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell
6572240	6573120	you about it.
6573120	6575760	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6579200	6579760	All right.
6579760	6581280	And Dark Sakura, what did you...
6581280	6582240	Whoa, sorry.
6582240	6583040	Wrong screen.
6583040	6586160	Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game?
6587280	6589440	Set on the screen, it's Mall Madness.
6591200	6594640	Mall Madness, sometimes called Electronic Mall Madness,
6594640	6597200	it is a shopping themed board game by Milton Bradley.
6597760	6601680	The original was released in 1988 with a talking version
6601680	6603280	in 1989.
6603280	6606000	The game has been updated several times, a new design
6606000	6609200	in 1996 and an update in 2004.
6609200	6611120	The last one was in 2020.
6611120	6614080	Oh, and there's other versions, including a Hannah Montana
6614080	6616240	version and a Littlest Pet Shop.
6616240	6618400	The Hannah Montana version actually has the distinction
6618400	6621200	of being the first version that has a dude on the cover.
6621200	6626480	So at any rate, the game was designed for players,
6627040	6631760	four players, nine and up, mostly young teenage girls.
6632960	6636080	And there were commercials targeting them and spending
6636080	6638240	the money and running all over the place.
6638240	6639440	You know, commercialism.
6641120	6645600	At any rate, it had the following contents in the box.
6645600	6648320	There was the box, the game board, the computer,
6648320	6651280	the instruction manual, four rubber pads to prevent
6651280	6655440	the pieces from slipping, six plastic wall pieces,
6655440	6659120	four cardboard shopping lists, two sale items,
6659120	6663200	one clearance sign, eight plastic ponds, two of each color,
6663200	6666720	which are red, blue, yellow, green, and one being male,
6666720	6671680	one being female, 40 plastic pegs to mark the shopping list,
6671680	6673920	paper money that looks kind of like current, you know,
6673920	6678800	American money, but color coded, four cardboard credit cards
6678800	6683040	and 29 pieces of cardboard to hold the thing together.
6683040	6685920	It's a three-dimensional field that looks like
6685920	6687680	a shopping mall with two stories.
6689280	6693920	There's some other places in there, but right in the center
6693920	6696960	is your little bank slash credit card thing.
6699120	6704240	So the voice, the computer thing dictates
6704240	6710480	where you're playing and it uses like double A's to run.
6711280	6713760	The computer parts are all made in the US.
6713760	6715440	It's very keen on saying so.
6715440	6718720	So the computer has two voices, one female, one male,
6720240	6722720	and then there's two credit card slots on top.
6722720	6723760	One is to buy items.
6723760	6725920	The other one is for the banking.
6725920	6728720	Now, except the 2004 version only uses a female voice.
6731520	6736640	At any rate, you either pay with paper cash or you pay
6736640	6739680	with the credit cards and you have four credit cards,
6739680	6743040	one called Fast Cash from Good Sense Bank,
6743760	6745920	Quick Draw from Dollar Days Bank,
6746640	6748720	Mega Money from Big Bucks Bank,
6748720	6751120	and Easy Money from Cash and Carry Bank.
6752320	6753600	Now the stores are the best.
6753600	6754720	The stores have the best names.
6755760	6760720	I Am Coffin Drugstore, Suits Me Fine Men's Shop,
6760720	6764000	Two Left Feet Shoes, Short Circuit Electronics,
6764000	6766320	Yuppie Puppies Pets, Scratchy's Records.
6766320	6767520	That one's pretty funny.
6767520	6771360	Novel Idea Books, Frump's Fashion Boutique,
6771360	6774560	The Right, W-R-I-T, Stuff Card Shop,
6774560	6778400	Fork It Over Kitchen Store, Hocus Focus Cameras,
6778400	6781920	Sweaty Sports, Made in the Shade Sunglasses,
6781920	6782880	Chip's Computers.
6782880	6783840	That one's clever.
6783840	6786640	Ruby's Jewelry, Dingling Phones,
6786640	6789520	M.T. Wallets Department Store,
6789520	6791280	and Tinker's Toys.
6791280	6793120	And then you have these four other areas.
6793120	6795280	You have Coneheads Ice Cream Shop,
6795280	6798160	The Restrooms, Vidiots Arcade,
6798160	6799520	and my favorite name ever,
6799520	6800880	Aunt Chovy's Pizza.
6801440	6802800	What do you buy in the restrooms?
6804800	6805360	You don't.
6805360	6806560	You just donate.
6806560	6807060	Oh.
6808320	6809120	Body stuff.
6809120	6810880	Hocus Focus is my favorite, by the way.
6811680	6812180	Yeah.
6813280	6815520	So basically the objective of the game
6815520	6819120	is to be the first person to finish your shopping list,
6819120	6820640	to get everything on the list,
6820640	6822240	and then get back to the parking lot
6822240	6824240	or whatever your last destination
6824240	6824960	is supposed to be,
6824960	6826560	depending on what version that you're playing.
6827520	6832240	And to make it more challenging in the 80, 90, 96 versions,
6832240	6834000	you could increase your goal to 10 items.
6835440	6837920	So basically you're going around the shopping mall.
6837920	6840880	There's some parts where it'll refuse your credit card
6840880	6842960	or nothing will come out of the bank
6842960	6846000	and there's all kinds of stuff going on.
6846000	6849440	The first person, of course, to do all that wins.
6850080	6855200	Um, I did not play this.
6855200	6857040	This was not a part of my childhood.
6857040	6860640	It was too expensive and a bad influence,
6861440	6866320	which still doesn't explain why I'm a consumer whore today.
6867920	6871440	But I mean, overall, it's pretty,
6871440	6873840	I actually would love to get everyone together
6873840	6875040	to play one of these,
6875040	6877840	but I'd have to get this version, the 96 version.
6878560	6881120	This may surprise you, but as the token gay
6881120	6885120	who had many, you know, lady friends at a certain age,
6885680	6887440	I never played this game either,
6887440	6889920	but you know, I wanted to, you know,
6889920	6892480	I know this may surprise you,
6892480	6893920	but I have played this game.
6899520	6900240	It was silly.
6900240	6901200	Did Nelly make you?
6902560	6904080	No, I played it with my sister.
6904800	6905440	She had it.
6905440	6906080	Okay. Okay.
6907920	6909680	It does look like it could be fun.
6909680	6910400	It is fun.
6910960	6912160	Who doesn't like going to the mall?
6912160	6912640	No, it's true.
6912640	6914800	I mean, who doesn't like going to the mall?
6914800	6916000	You know what's sad though?
6916000	6917440	We're looking back at this as like, you know,
6917440	6919280	the classic not video game of the week now,
6919280	6921360	but then like in 10 more years, it's going to be,
6922080	6922720	what's a mall?
6929040	6930160	Anyway, there's more.
6930160	6930660	Okay.
6931600	6931920	Sorry.
6931920	6933680	I needed chocolate to overcome this.
6934480	6936720	At any rate,
6936720	6939840	Milton Bradley did a line of digital electronic voice
6940400	6941680	board games after this.
6942480	6946720	In 1990, under their Parker Brothers brand,
6946720	6949600	they did an updated version of a 1984 game
6949600	6952960	called Mystery Mansion that had an electronic voice device.
6954000	6957200	In 1992, they released a game called Omega Virus.
6958000	6959520	I knew someone who had this.
6959520	6961600	I've never played it and I really want to.
6962480	6966160	So basically that game takes place on a space station
6966880	6969840	that's infected by an extraterrestrial computer virus.
6970800	6973280	And this one actually has a countdown timer
6973280	6974800	that if you don't complete your objectives
6974800	6976880	before the timer runs out, everyone dies.
6978880	6981520	So it's got a lot more tension to it.
6982400	6985280	But Michael Gray created Mall Madness.
6985280	6989440	He also designed Omega Virus and one other electronic game
6989440	6991040	you might find familiar.
6991680	6992400	Dream Phone.
6994560	6995200	And that's it.
6996400	6998080	You didn't decide to combine the two
6998080	7000080	and make Omega Mall Madness,
7000080	7001840	because that sounds like that'd be amazing.
7003920	7004480	There it is.
7004480	7006320	Your classic not video game.
7007120	7009600	And hey, I think the music isn't bad for me
7009600	7011280	having thrown it together in five minutes.
7011280	7012240	No, you did a great job.
7012240	7012740	Thank you.
7014000	7014500	All right.
7015680	7016160	Good pick.
7016160	7016660	Good pick.
7017520	7018000	All right.
7018000	7020640	And then one day it sounds like we'll have to all get together
7020640	7022320	and play this game before we go see Megan.
7022320	7022560	Okay.
7022560	7024320	I'll have to go find a copy.
7024320	7025040	Yeah, right.
7025040	7027520	I was like, where do you even find old board games?
7027520	7028480	I don't know.
7028480	7030160	So are they all good?
7030160	7032480	So somebody had joked when the segment started
7032480	7033520	and we were defining it.
7033520	7037120	Somebody said, Miltonious Games and Chat said,
7037120	7040640	today's classic non-video game, Tag.
7041360	7043360	Technically, Tag would qualify.
7043360	7045600	So are we only going to get board games in this segment
7045600	7048160	or are we going to get like playground games
7048160	7049280	and other interesting things?
7049280	7050560	Purchasable items.
7051120	7051520	Okay.
7051520	7052480	Purchasable items.
7052480	7052720	Okay.
7052720	7053200	I like that.
7053200	7053840	Okay.
7053840	7056720	So, you know, like not just board games,
7056720	7061040	but like different sorts of games that you can play
7061040	7063680	with people around you that you would have bought
7063680	7066000	in a store that aren't fucking cards.
7066000	7066500	All right.
7067040	7068560	At least that aren't like playing cards.
7068560	7069840	Well, and if you want to know more,
7069840	7071680	hit that follow button, that subscribe button,
7071680	7074320	that like button, the donate button, the email button,
7074320	7075680	the tweet button, hit it all.
7076400	7076800	All right.
7076800	7079520	Let's move.
7079520	7081600	Just hit a button and hope we see it.
7081600	7081920	Okay.
7082560	7083440	Moving on.
7083440	7085920	Let's get to some rapid.
7085920	7087040	Do you see what next month is?
7088320	7088960	I can't wait.
7089920	7092560	Microsoft has confirmed that there's going to be some games
7092560	7097280	leaving Game Pass in the next, well, week or so here.
7097280	7098880	So by January 15th.
7100160	7101040	Anacrusis.
7102000	7104400	We've got Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc
7104400	7105760	Anniversary Edition.
7105760	7109760	Nobody Saves the World, Paparazzi and Windjammers 2.
7110640	7112320	Those are going to be leaving Game Pass.
7112320	7116320	And apparently you get a 20% off of those games
7116320	7118640	if you decide to purchase them to keep playing them
7118640	7119520	like Paparazzi.
7119520	7122000	Who doesn't like a Paparazzi game with puppies?
7122880	7124480	And Roma all the way.
7124480	7124980	Yep.
7126080	7128720	Then, of course, this month we've got some free games
7128720	7134160	with PlayStation Plus and Xbox games with gold.
7134160	7137440	So on the PlayStation side, looks like Jedi Fallen Order,
7138000	7141760	Fallout 76 and Axiom Verge 2.
7143040	7146480	Those are going to be your free games for the month.
7146480	7151840	And then on Xbox, we've got looks like Iris Fall,
7153120	7155840	which is going to be from the 1st through the 31st.
7155840	7158160	And then from the 16th through the 15th,
7158160	7159440	you also get Autonauts.
7162400	7163120	All right.
7163120	7164240	Load up on those free games.
7165840	7167440	I've been doing that with the Epic Store.
7167440	7170560	That whole holiday, I only missed one.
7170560	7171840	But you know what stinks?
7171840	7174240	The one game I missed is the one I wanted to play
7174240	7175840	most of all out of all they gave away.
7175840	7177360	And that was them fighting herds.
7177360	7178960	Was the one free game I didn't get during.
7178960	7180400	Oh, yeah, I didn't get that either.
7180400	7182160	And I didn't realize that they were doing that
7182160	7184000	until well after it was started.
7184000	7186320	I think I did get Death Stranding for free.
7186320	7187120	Yeah, that was the big one.
7188000	7190160	And then there's some other stuff,
7190160	7191680	but I can't remember.
7191680	7192180	Yeah.
7192580	7193080	All right.
7193860	7194420	Dark Sakura.
7195860	7204420	So Namco is bringing in Galaga to the Arcade Archives.
7205780	7210180	So it, of course, we know it came out
7210180	7212820	as the sequel to Galaxian in 1981.
7213620	7217380	But it is one of their most iconic games
7217380	7219940	and it will be a part of that.
7220900	7225220	Available to download on PS4 and Switch at eight bucks.
7226420	7226920	All right.
7227700	7229460	Well, piggybacking on that a little bit
7229460	7231860	and talking about the future of Arcade Archives.
7231860	7236900	On January 26 in Japan is the New Zealand story.
7236900	7238420	So that is probably one.
7238420	7238900	Game!
7238900	7241140	Yeah, I know it's one that's probably lesser known overall,
7241140	7243060	but I know Dark Sakura has certainly picked that
7243060	7244580	as a classic game at some point before.
7245140	7248260	That is, of course, a sprite based platformer by Taito,
7248260	7250900	which will be available on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
7250900	7254260	It was originally in arcades in 1988.
7254260	7256100	It was a love letter to New Zealand.
7256100	7259300	It stars Tiki the Kiwi and you guide the bird
7259300	7260740	through different mazes.
7260740	7265940	You use balloons and dirigibles to rescue your animal friends
7265940	7267380	that are in cages.
7267380	7273700	So this was 1991 localized for the Nintendo Entertainment System,
7273700	7275300	but they called it Kiwi Craze,
7275300	7277940	but it is the same game if you ever saw that game.
7277940	7280420	So also the soundtrack.
7280420	7282100	A lot of people really dug for that game.
7282100	7283060	And just so you know,
7283060	7285140	that is pretty much in all the streaming services
7285140	7288020	where you find music, Amazon, Spotify, YouTube, you name it.
7288020	7289700	You can check that out as well.
7289700	7292820	So that is available as well.
7292820	7294980	By the way, speaking of Taito, since I brought them up,
7294980	7297220	I also want to point out it's been announced
7297220	7301140	that they're doing a 70th anniversary celebration in 2023.
7301140	7302740	70 years of Taito.
7304020	7306420	But that's not how long they've been making games,
7306420	7307460	but pretty close.
7308900	7310740	But of course, the company behind Space Invaders,
7310740	7312180	Bubble Bobble and so forth,
7312180	7315220	they've made a commemorative website and a Twitter account,
7315860	7319940	but no word as to what the celebration is going to be just yet.
7319940	7321940	Maybe some type of compilation, who knows?
7322500	7326340	Of course, Taito originally founded in 1953 by Michael Kogan.
7327220	7330260	It originally started as vending machines and jukeboxes
7330260	7333380	and then went into electromechanical games in the 60s.
7333380	7337060	And of course, then it all blew up with Space Invaders in 1978,
7337060	7342100	which was in Japan was serious business.
7342100	7344740	It was pretty big business here too,
7344740	7348820	but probably I would say Pac-Man was the little more like,
7348820	7349860	was the bigger game here.
7349860	7352740	And then Space Invaders was like even bigger in Japan.
7352740	7356820	So, all right, let's move on with some release dates.
7356820	7358420	I'm not sure we have a lot this week,
7358420	7362900	but sometimes companies are starting to put things out early in the year.
7362900	7364980	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
7364980	7366020	Loki, how about the US?
7366020	7367620	We have a few things.
7367620	7372100	We have Children of Silent Town on PC, Nintendo Switch,
7372100	7375540	PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
7376500	7379940	Drago Noka on PC and Nintendo Switch.
7380900	7384100	Lone Ruin on PC and Nintendo Switch.
7384820	7388420	Vengeful Guardian Moonrider on PC, Nintendo Switch,
7388420	7390660	PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
7391460	7395940	Dragon Ball Z Cockroach on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
7396500	7401540	One Piece Odyssey on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
7401540	7403860	I'm sorry, that's actually, yeah,
7404820	7409140	Xbox Series, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and PC.
7409140	7409860	And that is it.
7411540	7412660	By the way, just quickly in chat,
7412660	7414660	before I get to the Japanese releases,
7414660	7416260	Miltonius Games in chat said,
7416900	7419860	now I want a Taito 70 made by Digital Eclipse
7419860	7423460	kind of tying into the Atari 50 that came out.
7423460	7426420	And you know, Taito really does have a pretty rich library.
7426420	7427940	They've done compilations before.
7427940	7432820	I had one on Xbox that was pretty good for that era of Taito games.
7433380	7436420	And I know things like Rygar arcade version was on it.
7436420	7438740	And of course, like Bubble Bobble, Paris All Stars,
7438740	7439460	and that whole thing.
7439460	7441060	And then that made me go,
7441060	7444740	ooh, that's a company that Arcade 1up needs to get with.
7444740	7445540	Although to be fair,
7445540	7449700	I think Taito had their own smaller reduced machines.
7449700	7451300	They're probably not interested in getting in business
7451300	7452420	with Arcade 1up just yet.
7452420	7453860	Although I don't know to be determined,
7453860	7456340	but I was like, if I can get a Bubble Bobble machine,
7456340	7458020	that's, ooh, I think a lot of people would go
7458020	7459780	for a Bubble Bobble machine, that's for sure.
7459780	7462260	So, but anyway, back on track,
7462260	7464660	let's talk about what's coming out in Japan this week.
7464660	7468500	And the release date for these games on the Nintendo Switch
7468500	7470420	would be January 13th.
7471620	7473540	Really, it's just some new amiibo this week.
7474020	7476100	A Sephiroth and a Kazuya figure
7476100	7478020	will both be out released this week in Japan.
7478660	7480340	That's really it for the Switch.
7480340	7482580	Yeah, we don't have another release till the 19th.
7482580	7484180	Looking at the PlayStation 5,
7484180	7485220	okay, we have a couple of games there.
7485220	7487700	We have One Piece Odyssey is released this week,
7487700	7489060	speaking of Namco.
7489060	7491380	They're also putting out Dragon Ball Z Kakarot
7491380	7492980	is out this week in Japan as well.
7493780	7495940	That's it for releases this week, so.
7496900	7498340	Oh, sorry.
7498340	7500020	YYR says, did you mean Rystan?
7500020	7501460	Rygar was Tecmo, I think.
7502180	7503300	Yeah, you are correct.
7504180	7507460	I got my tease blurred, but there was a collection.
7511060	7512180	Because I know I have, oh well.
7513620	7514820	Old man brain kicking in,
7514820	7517460	but there was some type of compilation I remember having.
7517460	7519060	Rob, I'm older than you.
7519060	7519940	Don't say those things.
7519940	7520820	Well, I'm just saying.
7524260	7526180	Anyway, is it my turn now?
7526180	7526680	Yeah.
7527060	7527560	Okay.
7528280	7531640	So on the 10th for Xbox,
7531640	7533640	we have the House of the Dead remake.
7534280	7540760	On the 13th for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, One Piece Odyssey.
7541640	7545720	And then also on PlayStation and Xbox the same day,
7546280	7548200	Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.
7552680	7554280	I've been watching the Japanese version,
7555640	7556280	which is better.
7557000	7558200	The voice actors are better.
7558200	7559800	Rest in peace, Bulma's voice actor.
7561640	7562920	All right, let's move on.
7562920	7564280	We have a few more headlines for you,
7564280	7567160	and then we'll try to take some calls if anybody wants to call in tonight.
7567160	7570360	But I do want to make sure we're wrapped up by 9 Pacific tonight,
7570360	7572280	just because with the storms coming in,
7572280	7575400	I want to make sure Dark Soccer gets some DVD time in.
7575400	7579400	And I also want time to take an edible and fall asleep.
7579400	7582600	Take an edible and fall asleep before the storms come in, to be honest.
7582600	7583100	All right.
7583100	7583960	Do you need to share?
7584040	7587000	Because I don't.
7589080	7592040	What I'm talking about is a perfectly legal activity in California,
7592040	7593480	so I'm not doing anything.
7593480	7597240	But I only use them when I need to go to sleep.
7597240	7598760	So all right.
7598760	7600200	I use them for pain relief.
7601800	7602680	No, seriously.
7602680	7603320	No, I get it.
7603320	7604120	I get it.
7604120	7610280	I hear it's very popular for Lady Park cramps.
7610280	7611560	Yes, it very much is.
7611560	7613560	Oprah, was it Oprah that had a company?
7614360	7619400	That made edibles for Shark Week.
7619400	7620200	Interesting.
7620200	7620760	Interesting.
7620760	7621960	Yeah, very cool stuff.
7622680	7623180	Moving on.
7624680	7625560	I think we're to Loki.
7626200	7631800	Yes, so the developer behind the PlayStation 2 emulator,
7631800	7638440	Aether SX2, has decided to discontinue development of the app,
7638440	7643400	because, of course, not Sony coming after them,
7643400	7645960	but, you know, toxic fan community.
7646760	7651960	Apparently, they're tired of never-ending online impersonations,
7651960	7653960	complaints, demands, and death threats.
7654920	7655880	Because that's what you do.
7656760	7659640	Reach out to developers and threaten them with death
7659640	7662360	if they don't develop something that's free.
7663240	7663640	Okay.
7663640	7665080	And they're just not going to do it at all.
7665960	7671160	So, yeah, Aether SX2 is always meant to be a fun hobby for me,
7671160	7672520	not profit-driven.
7672520	7675160	It doesn't make sense to continue working on a hobby,
7675160	7676280	which isn't fun anymore.
7677240	7680200	Thanks to everyone who wasn't a dick for the last year.
7681800	7684440	So that is annoying.
7684440	7685560	But I hate people.
7686200	7687160	Some people's children.
7688600	7689880	It's one of those things where it's like,
7690440	7691960	you know how we kind of always talk about,
7691960	7693640	like, if OLR was going to get big,
7693640	7695160	we would have gotten big years ago.
7695160	7700200	And but it's kind of in some ways nice that we didn't get big.
7700920	7702280	This is one of those reasons.
7703080	7705400	We haven't had to put up with our share of bullshit
7705400	7706120	over the years.
7706120	7707720	But it's one of those things where it's like,
7708920	7712440	some people's children do not know how to act.
7712440	7717720	And it's just, it's just, it's so ridiculous.
7717720	7719800	It's, it's just, it's sad.
7720840	7722440	You know, and on one hand, it's like,
7722440	7723800	don't give those people the time of day,
7723800	7726200	but at the same time, easier said than done.
7726200	7729400	Like, and that's the part of where social media,
7730040	7732280	especially Twitter, has made it,
7732280	7734920	and all my issues with Twitter aside for a minute,
7734920	7738040	like that ability to direct message someone,
7738040	7741240	basically, even if it's not direct direct messaging him,
7741240	7743000	at them, and that there's a good chance
7743000	7744440	they're going to read what you say,
7744440	7747560	like, it's really gross.
7747560	7750600	And that's why, if I do want to get on my soapbox for a minute,
7750600	7752760	why I completely disagree with the direction
7752760	7754680	that Twitter's new owner has been taking the company,
7754680	7757320	because he wants to make it by the fact
7757320	7759080	that anybody can buy a blue checkmark
7759080	7760600	so that you can yell.
7760600	7762920	Like that, that's how he wants to make money,
7762920	7765960	is that you pay $8 a month and you can yell at celebrities
7765960	7767480	and they have to read what you say.
7767480	7771320	But it's kind of like, you do not understand how this works
7771320	7772520	and how you're going to drive people,
7772520	7775320	the main people from your platform that are lifting your platform up.
7775320	7776600	Don't say if they mean to him,
7776600	7778040	because they'll hurt his fee fees.
7778600	7779960	Or track his plane.
7779960	7782760	But anyway, soapbox stuff aside,
7783720	7784840	it's one of those downsides.
7784840	7786680	And of course, it goes without saying,
7786680	7788440	I shouldn't have to say it to this audience.
7788440	7790440	I really don't think I need to say it to this audience.
7790440	7791880	I think the crowd that would do this
7791880	7793560	doesn't listen to this program.
7793560	7795720	Good, but don't do this.
7796440	7800360	But even, I think people listening to OLR
7800360	7802040	are intelligent enough to not do this
7802040	7805800	when it comes to talking to developers.
7805800	7809640	But even consider the way you approach criticism sometimes.
7809640	7811800	Constructive criticism, good.
7813240	7815480	Fuck you, you fucking fuck, bad.
7815480	7817080	Of course, depending on who it is,
7817080	7818680	because some people need to be told.
7820520	7827480	But for the most part, especially normal people,
7828440	7831080	like people that are working on these emulators and so forth,
7831080	7832680	just like you or me or whatever.
7832680	7834760	Like, don't be this rude.
7834760	7835720	It's not necessary.
7835720	7836520	Call it normal.
7838280	7840840	Yeah, and there's also a big difference between
7840840	7842120	fuck you, you fucking fuck,
7842120	7846520	and I'm going to insert the rest of your death right here,
7846520	7847480	because I'm not going to say it,
7847480	7849240	because somebody's going to quote it out of context.
7849240	7849960	Disgusting.
7849960	7851880	Yeah, there's a big, big difference
7851880	7853080	between those two things also.
7853640	7856040	Just don't say this stuff, even as a joke.
7856040	7856760	It's not a joke.
7858840	7859560	It really isn't.
7861560	7864600	I don't understand when people started thinking
7864600	7866040	that saying this shit was okay.
7866840	7867800	That's what I don't get.
7868600	7869720	Phil of Nine in chat says,
7869720	7872360	if people approach criticism with an ounce of kindness,
7872360	7874440	it would be a better online environment.
7874440	7874940	True.
7875580	7877820	Maybe an ounce of maturity as well.
7877820	7879020	You know, that's part of it.
7879020	7879520	For sure.
7881260	7883020	All right, let's move on.
7884060	7886540	Dark Sakura, even more with Dead by Daylight,
7886540	7889020	except this feels like a totally separate game sometimes.
7890380	7891980	And it kind of is,
7891980	7895580	but I know that people who've talked to me,
7895580	7898300	you know, bring up Dead by Daylight Mobile in the past,
7899180	7902220	and I couldn't play the old version,
7903100	7905580	but I really was interested in playing the version
7905580	7908380	that they got overseas, which is the NetEase version.
7908380	7912380	It had different outfits and different Mori animation
7912380	7913820	and all kinds of neat stuff.
7913820	7916220	There was even like this golden Legion mask.
7916220	7916860	Oh, so cool.
7917660	7921660	So now though, we are getting the NetEase version.
7922460	7924300	I am so excited about it.
7924860	7928380	And the more pre-registers that they get
7929260	7933260	is opening up new rewards.
7933260	7938300	So I mean, they're up over 500,000 pre-registers,
7939500	7943900	which actually now puts people into the Running to Win Wraith statue.
7944940	7948140	They're already giving out all kinds of blood points
7948140	7952620	and iridescent shards and all kinds of stuff in game.
7952620	7953980	So I think that that's awesome.
7954700	7959820	And they're also giving out other special items for pre-registrants,
7959820	7966140	like some different cosmetics for Meg, Dwight, for Hillbilly, for Claudette.
7967580	7972540	And there is a pre-registration ritual,
7972540	7975980	where you can also get a certain Fang Min account,
7975980	7977740	and that's if you've signed up for all the things,
7977740	7979900	which I was already signed up for most of the things.
7979900	7981100	I only had to do one more thing.
7981900	7986380	Um, although said outfit will also make you a target
7986380	7987820	because it is very bright.
7988940	7992300	But at any rate, I mean, the NetEase version of the game
7992300	7994140	just has looked amazing.
7994140	7995900	It had all kinds of extras in it.
7995900	7998540	I mean, and playing on a mobile device
7998540	8000860	is going to be a different experience.
8000860	8002620	But I thought it was worth mentioning
8002620	8004780	that we are finally getting the NetEase version.
8005420	8005920	Huh.
8007340	8007840	Cool.
8009260	8009740	That's it.
8009740	8010460	Off to check it out.
8012060	8016060	Do if you if you do the registration stuff, you get bonuses.
8016060	8017100	Well, I do like bonuses.
8017820	8018320	All right.
8018940	8021660	Uh, Loki, another story from you.
8021660	8025500	And this is this is, uh, we will talk about these series of games very often.
8025500	8028380	This is this is catastrophic for these fans, and it's a bummer.
8029020	8033420	So, um, you know, the Madden Ultimate team is it's it's a thing.
8033420	8037340	People love their ultimate teams and their franchise modes and stuff like that.
8037340	8042940	Well, if you loved it enough to play it during December 28th or the 29th.
8042940	8044220	Got some bad news for you.
8044220	8048140	Your franchise save files are probably deleted or corrupted.
8048140	8053260	So they had an issue where it corrupted their online database, corrupted,
8054620	8056860	corrupting the franchise save files for many users,
8056860	8059500	essentially deleting their custom leagues entirely.
8060460	8064140	And they said, unfortunately, if you've logged into franchise leagues during this time,
8064140	8068700	your data was affected due to a data storage issue that resulted in the franchise files
8068700	8069420	being corrupted.
8069980	8075180	We know this is important that your franchise or how important your franchises are to you.
8075180	8079100	And we are actively working on a restore to fix some of the files via backup.
8079740	8083500	Unfortunately, they're only they're estimating
8083500	8087340	they're only going to be able to recover 40 percent of the users data.
8087340	8094700	So a lot of those, it's permanently been wiped out.
8094700	8097980	Well, it's going to make people distrustful of this whole cloud thing anyway,
8097980	8101020	which, as we all know, the cloud is just somebody else's computer on the Internet
8101020	8101900	is what the cloud is.
8101900	8105500	But it just it stinks when you can't like, how did they not have a backup
8106140	8107740	thing in place like regular?
8107740	8110060	It's just like, come on.
8110060	8112460	And this isn't some small fry game either, you know?
8114460	8116140	Yeah, it's very annoying.
8116940	8117440	All right.
8118060	8123500	Well, on a somber note, you know, this is the first show of 2023, and we're only eight
8123500	8124700	days into 2023.
8124700	8128620	And already there's been, you know, a number of people that have touched the game industry
8128620	8131100	in one way or another who have passed away.
8131100	8135020	So just a moment to acknowledge some of these folks that passed away.
8135020	8137020	And there's probably plenty more than this, too.
8137020	8138540	This is just the list in front of me right now.
8139260	8144460	Earl Bone, who was the voice of Monkey Island's Captain LeChuck, passed away.
8144460	8148460	I believe he was also one of those actors that was that guy.
8148460	8151900	Because like when I saw the his picture, you know, I was like, Oh, that guy, you've seen
8151900	8153980	him in plenty of movies and so forth.
8153980	8155580	He was in things like Seinfeld.
8156620	8158620	God, I'm trying to think like what movies he was in.
8160300	8162380	But yeah, he's been in quite a few other things.
8162380	8164780	He was in World of Warcraft doing some voices as well.
8165420	8165820	And so on.
8165820	8166860	He's he's done a lot.
8166860	8168300	So unfortunately, he passed away this week.
8169020	8176620	Ken Block also passed away, who was involved with some Need for Speed titles, as well as
8176620	8177980	the Dirt series.
8177980	8182540	His cars, because he's a racing guy, also appeared in the Forza Motorsport series.
8182540	8185660	So he has, you know, some connections to that as well.
8185660	8188940	So again, that was Ken Block who passed away at the age of 55.
8188940	8190060	That's far too young.
8190700	8193100	Yeah, it was a snowmobile accident.
8194380	8196620	And then you hear that Jeremy Renner was a very similar thing.
8196700	8199180	He's still with us, but just scary, scary, scary.
8199180	8199740	Be careful.
8199740	8200240	Yeah.
8201020	8202060	And then this is...
8202060	8203500	Don't run your snowplow, y'all.
8204380	8205820	Don't own a snowplow.
8205820	8207820	Like, why do you have a full-size snowplow?
8207820	8208700	Like, seriously.
8210140	8211100	Also passing away.
8211900	8215740	This was pointed out to us on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8215740	8222220	James Buster Corley, half of the Dave and Busters title there, co-founder of the Dave
8222300	8227420	and Busters chain, passed away on January 2nd at his home at the age of 72.
8228060	8229580	So that was...
8229580	8230780	So young.
8231500	8232000	Yeah.
8233180	8236300	Unfortunately, it appears he passed away of a self-inflicted wound.
8236300	8244700	So, but still his contributions to the gaming culture with Dave and Busters are pretty
8244700	8245660	monumentous.
8245660	8247580	So thank you, Tiger Claw Terminator.
8248860	8251500	LeChuck Earl Bone was in the Terminator films as well.
8251500	8251980	That's right.
8252620	8260060	So anyway, that is it for the stories we had slotted for tonight.
8260060	8263980	I do want to take a moment to open it up, though, to any other questions, comments,
8263980	8265820	and so forth, or any calls.
8265820	8271100	You can join our green room over at our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8271100	8274300	And I would encourage you to join the Discord and chat with us throughout the week as well.
8275100	8278940	Tiger Claw points out the founder of Creative Labs also passed away.
8278940	8279340	That's right.
8279340	8280300	I did see that.
8280300	8285260	I neglected that that was in the past week, because I'm trying to make up for two weeks
8285260	8285500	here.
8285500	8286700	But yes, that's right.
8286700	8287980	He had passed away as well.
8287980	8294060	So we're just a few weeks into the year and not even just a week and a day into the year.
8294060	8300060	And it's, you know, I know sometimes it feels like, because I think there's even been comments
8300060	8303820	on this in Discord, it feels like, my gosh, we're losing everybody this year.
8303820	8307100	But, you know, it's what happens.
8307100	8308700	Celebrities come, celebrities go.
8309420	8310940	It's any take any year.
8310940	8312540	Hey, guess what, people?
8312540	8312940	What?
8312940	8313820	People die.
8313820	8320380	Yeah, it's all the time for many reasons, which just means treasure your own life and
8320380	8322220	the people that are in it all the more.
8322220	8322780	That's right.
8323340	8330380	And there's nothing wrong with saying dead or die or being with people near you after
8330380	8331180	they have died.
8331180	8333500	It's respect for the dead.
8334140	8341660	I want to be on display at my house before I'm shot into orbit.
8341660	8344300	Do you want something like what the Pope's getting?
8344300	8345580	Where you're on full display?
8346780	8350700	No, no, not like that, but no, no, no, not lay in state.
8350700	8356140	But, like, I remember being a kid and people having, like, their memorials in their living
8356140	8356380	room.
8358220	8362860	It might just be a Southern thing, but it was done well before the funeral industry
8362860	8366060	took over and became a big financial conglomerate.
8366620	8366860	No.
8366860	8371020	When Jim passed away, they did something in someone's living room for that.
8371020	8371820	Like, I remember.
8371820	8372700	So it's not just a.
8373260	8375900	Yeah, but we don't do that anymore.
8375900	8378140	And I'm going on a tangent.
8378140	8378940	I know I am.
8378940	8381980	But it's been something that's on my mind, honestly, enough lately.
8382780	8385100	I watched My Girl recently.
8387260	8391660	Yeah, talk about crying and then things they get wrong in the funeral industry.
8393340	8403340	But, I mean, I think that instead of treating it like I mean, yeah, it can be tragic, especially
8403340	8404860	when someone takes their own life.
8404860	8410460	But I think that we need to just embrace it a little bit more, you know, and celebrate
8411260	8414300	that they lived and that they did good things.
8416620	8417420	Comments in chat.
8418380	8421660	Phil of Nine in chat says, I'm sorry, wait, let me read this one first from Funara.
8421660	8425020	It says, my sister wants her body thrown in the back of a truck and taken to the FBI's
8425020	8425740	body farm.
8425740	8426240	Haha.
8428060	8433260	That was donated to science to study idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
8434140	8438540	Phil of Nine in chat says, I watched Spoiler Alert tonight, speaking of sad movies about
8438540	8439820	dying, but it was beautiful.
8440540	8442780	And that's not an actual spoiler because it's in the trailer.
8443580	8445100	But you know what's funny?
8445100	8449340	Because it makes me think of gay movies and, you know, to put things on a more lighthearted
8449340	8455740	note, I do think it is really funny going back to Megan, how Megan has made more money
8455740	8457900	at the box office because Megan did very well.
8457900	8463500	It didn't make Avatar money, but it made it like made back its budget and then some already.
8463500	8468060	So the funny thing about Megan is it's doing well enough where like it did better than
8468060	8468940	bros did.
8469500	8475020	If it tells you how the gay community is responding to who our real queen is.
8475020	8477980	So it's official.
8478860	8483420	Megan has dethroned Billy Eichner as the face of gay cinema.
8483420	8483920	There it is.
8485980	8486480	All right.
8488300	8489420	There's no calls.
8489420	8490300	That's fine.
8490300	8491100	We don't I don't know.
8491100	8493020	I didn't check on emails, but I don't remember seeing any.
8493020	8493500	I'm sorry.
8493500	8494060	I should.
8494060	8494540	I did.
8494540	8495980	I didn't check on them either.
8495980	8497660	I'm a bad email person.
8497660	8498540	I can look real quick.
8498540	8499040	Sorry.
8499500	8500700	Participate at orange.com.
8500700	8501340	I'm not sorry.
8501340	8502060	I mean, I'm kidding.
8503020	8503520	Okay.
8505340	8506300	You know what?
8506300	8508700	There's nothing but spam.
8508700	8510860	Yeah, we've been getting targeted with that again lately.
8510860	8512780	Um, I fucking hate it.
8512780	8514860	DJ Rama S in chat says at Rob Roberts.
8514860	8515900	So is that a good thing?
8515900	8521020	Asking about the bros and Megan thing and Tiger Claw says, yeah, at least bros doesn't
8521020	8524220	talk down to the audience who didn't watch it because the movie was bad.
8524220	8525980	I heard the movie was all right.
8525980	8530060	Like the Alan actually watched some of it on a plane, but then he realized he was watching
8530060	8533100	it on a plane with some of the content in it and turned it off.
8533100	8538620	Um, but he said it was funny and a lot of people say it was humorous, but I'm kind of
8538620	8541740	with what you were saying there is like, I don't appreciate that.
8541740	8545660	Like I'm an asshole or I'm letting down the community or something by not seeing your
8545660	8546460	stupid movie.
8546460	8551020	Cause there's lots of gay cinema out there that doesn't get the type of attention that
8551020	8551900	that movie got.
8551900	8555260	And it's like extraordinarily frustrating that somebody would use their platform to
8555260	8557820	call people that don't go to their, see their movie homophobes.
8557820	8563420	Like, I just think that was, that was such a piss poor move on Billy Eichner who does
8563420	8569420	some funny things sometimes, but does some really not funny things other times.
8569420	8571740	And that is an example, one of the things that's not funny.
8571740	8573580	The category of shitty.
8573580	8573900	Yeah.
8573900	8576940	It's just, it's inappropriate.
8576940	8585260	So as far as I'm concerned, Megan kicking his butt is swift justice the way Megan would
8585260	8585820	deliver it.
8588140	8591100	I like a strong kick in the, the pant region.
8592540	8593340	All right.
8593340	8594060	Well, that's it.
8594060	8595820	There's no calls awaiting.
8595820	8599260	I guess I should see if there's any last minute stories just as a formality, but I'm guessing
8599260	8600220	this week, probably not.
8601420	8602140	Not really.
8602140	8607820	I was trying to remember what the name of this thing was, but there's a new like virtual
8607820	8610700	console system, like the Pico 8 that just got released.
8611340	8613820	That's like almost like a super Pico 8, but not.
8614380	8617260	I'm just trying to remember, trying to remember what it was called.
8618540	8618780	Yeah.
8618780	8621260	It's like, it's like a fake console, like the Pico 8.
8621260	8621500	Yeah.
8621500	8623020	Like the old Sega one, right?
8623900	8625340	It is sort of.
8625340	8628300	So it's, it's basically, it's a fake console format.
8628300	8631580	That's a virtual machine that you can develop games for.
8631580	8635420	It's like, they have, you can buy it and then like, you can develop for it for free.
8635420	8637100	It doesn't really exist.
8637100	8644060	It's just like, it's like arbitrary format that they made up that exists in the digital
8644060	8644700	space.
8644700	8647100	Although it would be cool if there was a physical Pico 8 console.
8648460	8651820	But I was hearing Pico, like the Sega system.
8651820	8653020	So that was Mima's hearing.
8653020	8654540	Pico, P-I-C-O.
8654540	8655900	Pico 8 is what it's called.
8657340	8658300	As in De-guy-o.
8659900	8660300	Yes.
8660300	8665580	Like, I don't remember though what the new one was.
8665580	8670220	I saw a video on it earlier this week, but yeah, I can't remember what the new fantasy
8670220	8671260	console was.
8671260	8671900	Oh, that's what it is.
8671900	8674940	Or the Boulevard that the LA Convention Center is on.
8675820	8682540	And it leads to the, the best of all the Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles.
8686540	8686780	Yeah.
8686780	8689260	So I don't know.
8689260	8690460	I'll have to find it.
8690460	8690960	All right.
8691660	8693820	Oh, Philonines says, I used to live near Pico.
8693820	8695500	I guess it's one of those, like, just huge.
8695500	8697740	I think it's probably like a very, very, very long street.
8697740	8701260	Because I remember going down there when I used to travel down there a lot for work.
8701740	8706780	There was Victory in Van Nuys, and those were like the streets that went through the entire
8706780	8709420	fucking valley, like north side of LA.
8710380	8713660	So it's like, you talk about Victory in Van Nuys, you could be talking about like seven
8713660	8718460	different cities from Burbank all the way to whatever's on the end of that, Woodland
8718460	8720380	Hills or even further, probably even further.
8721100	8722300	So, all right.
8722940	8724780	Well, that's about it.
8724780	8726940	We're going to wrap up tonight.
8728140	8730300	That is it for another episode of Orange on its Radio.
8730300	8731820	Good way to start 2023.

8744220	8745020	Hello.
8745020	8748380	So tell a friend a five star review.
8748380	8748940	I found it.
8748940	8750380	It's the Picotron.
8750380	8751420	That's what it's called.
8751420	8752620	Picotron.
8752620	8752860	Okay.
8752860	8754300	Oh, it's just this thing.
8754300	8754620	All right.
8755340	8759980	Tell a friend a five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found
8759980	8761260	this show goes an awful long way.
8761260	8762300	So thank you for those as well.
8762300	8766620	A follow for VOG Network on Twitch, whether you're here live or not, super appreciated.
8767260	8771340	And of course, join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
8771340	8773420	Once again, best of luck to our pal Bobby Black Wolf.
8773420	8773900	Go to bed.
8773900	8775500	You've got some announcing to do in a few hours.
8776380	8779500	And that's about it.
8779500	8783740	Before I get the final, final thoughts, let me start with Dark Sakura with her final thought,
8783740	8787660	because I know you're off to do some Dead by Daylighting.
8787660	8792380	Still in my heart of hearts, a filthy pig mane.
8793740	8794060	All right.
8794060	8794700	Have a good stream.
8797980	8799660	And Loki, your final thought for tonight?
8800380	8803340	I'm hopefully going to be making more content this week.
8803340	8804700	I've got a lot of videos to put out.
8805500	8805900	Always.
8807580	8812620	My final thought is one game I forgot I played this week was No Man's Sky, because I attempted
8812620	8816620	to do the redo of Expedition 7 on stream.
8817420	8822060	I got so frustrated yet again with climbing those fucking mountains just to get attacked
8822060	8826620	by alien things like that was just a poor expedition and I didn't finish it.
8826620	8831580	So my streak of completing every No Man's Sky expedition has been broken.
8831580	8836700	But to be honest, if I'm going to break it on any expedition, number seven fucking earned
8836700	8837260	it.
8837260	8838780	So that's it.
8838780	8839980	That's it for my final thought.
8839980	8843580	We'll see you all here next time in seven days when we do it all again.
8843580	8845260	I hope you all have a wonderful week.
8845260	8846380	We will see you next time.
8846380	8847420	And guess what?
8847420	8851100	The holidays live on with our ending tonight because I forgot to flip it out tonight.
8851100	8852460	So what about it one more time?
8852460	8854620	We're still within are we within 12 days of Christmas?
8855500	8856300	No, I guess we're back.
8856300	8856860	Well, you know what?
8856860	8857900	It's 16 bits now.
8857900	8859180	16 days of Christmas.
8859180	8860300	Have a good night, everyone.
