00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,240
Happy New Year, January 8th, Rob, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,440
Loki. I slept too long. I slept too long.

3
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:58,920
It's okay, Jason, we weren't here last week. Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. And we are live once again with episode number 943 of our show.

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:27,000
For January the 8th of 2023. See, Jason just kept waking up every single day hearing that they were doing another vote in the house and thinking it was Groundhog Day all over again. That's what was going on with the intro there. Anyway. Hi, I'm Rob Roberts. And I'm here with you for our first show of our 21st broadcast year from 2002 to 2023. I am Rob Roberts and joining me is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hey, how is your 2023 so far?

5
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,960
Rainy.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,080
Yeah, yeah. We'll talk more about that in a moment. But please say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

7
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,080
Hello.

8
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,160
Hi, Loki. How are you?

9
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm fine. Tired as usual.

10
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,480
Yeah. Me too.

11
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,440
Well, it's medication now. Well, I mean, it has been medication for a while.

12
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Oh, okay. Well, I hope you are. I hope the medication is helping more than it's-

13
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Oh, yeah, it's it's it's just it makes me tired.

14
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,040
Yeah, I got you.

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:21,920
And hello to our chatters because we do tape live of course every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network. Six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We do tape our show live. We're here every week. We weren't here last week. We were originally planning to be here January 1. But then just kind of a domino effect started happening. I mean, we did a show on December 25 for heaven's sake. So we got we gave you something during the holiday. But yeah, New Year's Day just didn't end up

16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:47,200
working out. I had been in a show the night before and then the power went out for quite some time that night. The storms you're hearing about in Sacramento, which, yeah, I mean, like if you go to like USA Today, you're gonna see they have a story about half a million people in Sacramento were without power last night. And I think all three of us were among them at some point or another. So yeah, we're living all that right now. And it's pretty it's pretty pretty gnarly.

17
00:02:47,200 --> 00:03:17,040
I didn't think the storms were that bad. But I can I, you know, I'm also very, very biased about that. Yeah. Um, I, I can, it's it's the kind of of rain that a Californian wouldn't be ready for. Right. And it's even though it's happened before, and they should be ready. It's the whole Well, hopefully, the whole reason why we have the weir is to, you know, redirect the waters so that hopefully downtown doesn't flood. Some folks in chat,

18
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:43,840
as Joe and her mat says, I heard about bad flooding and sack as well. Yeah, it's it's really sad, but it is the more rural parts of town. The way to the south end and without doxing ourselves live on air. I will just say, Jamie lives on the south end, but not that far south. I live on the north end. And Loki lives like East ish in the middle. So none of us are near that area that's flooding, but not to minimize the horrible stuff

19
00:03:43,840 --> 00:04:10,960
on a hill. So yeah, it's never going to be a problem. They just trees falling. Yeah, that was it. And then last night after the power went out, our trash can fell over. So I had to go out last night, but it wasn't raining, though. It was just super windy. It was kind of creepy because it was like super bright outside, even though there was no electricity anywhere. It was just that like the clouds, you know, and everything kept the light in. But yeah, it was a little creepy. But

20
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:40,920
flooding, it's been more towards like the rivers and stuff. And like some of these creaks have swelled quite a bit where it's like gone over the road and everything. Yeah. So and unfortunately, that rural south area is very likely to flood again tonight. So So our show should stay on air through tonight, because the next part of the bomb cyclone or whatever you want to call I'm sorry, we're talking about personal stuff. But it does it does kind of impact the show because like I would say last week in part impact show. Yeah, last week in part, I really wasn't feeling it.

21
00:04:40,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Because the night before had been really rough for the storm. Loki had a personal engagement. Dark Soccer and I were both just kind of like, man, at that point. So we're just like, let's just we earned a week off. So we took the week off. I'm sure nobody's it was like, let's call the whole thing. Yeah, pretty much. I'm sure nobody's, you know, upset or anything. But it's just one of those. That's how it happened. So now we're here tonight. But yeah, I had had my procedure before that.

22
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,040
I that's right. And I was I was a little like, Oh, you sure you want to do the show? Like, yeah, so

23
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:21,060
yeah, on the 25th. I had started preparing for it, which was fine. But then I don't know, I was just like, I don't want to I don't want to exist.

24
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:33,840
Well, and then that's the other thing. So So keep in mind, last week, we didn't do a show because it was storming. And then it stormed again in the middle of the week. And then it stormed again last night. And now it's gonna storm again tonight. Like that's that's the problem we're having right now is

25
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:46,360
that we're not, you know, and again, to toss it back to a comment Dark Soccer said earlier about how we're not used to it. We're also because we're not used to it. We're not built for it. That's, that's, that's the huge problem is that, you know, although they they have taken many

26
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:59,840
precautions and in parts of town that are prone to flooding, like I was talking about with the weir earlier and stuff to redirect the the water to the causeway and stuff. You know, it's just, it's, it's, it's a lot. It's a lot of rain back to back to back.

27
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:29,660
I remember moving out here and seeing all these buildings like are made of plywood is their base. I'm like, where's your rebar? Where's the you know, where are your your concrete bases where you know, and I was just like, man, if if the weather even sneezes, this place is gonna fall over. I wouldn't go out on the balcony of the apartment building

28
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,340
because it was made of wood. Yeah. But I mean, when I first moved out here,

29
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:47,100
but at the same time, if an Earth if a major earthquake happened in the middle of Boston, a major earthquake, none of my having a middle Boston, the city would topple over and I hope it never does. I'm not you know, but I'm just saying the architecture is different. You're prepared for different climate sorts of things.

30
00:06:47,100 --> 00:07:02,340
Exactly. It's the same thing that people like, Oh, Alabama gets hurricanes. Why don't you people move? I'm like, Los Angeles gets earthquakes. Why don't you people move? It's something it's Northern California gets set on fire regularly. Why don't you move?

31
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:12,260
The only town that's perfect 100% of the time is San Diego. I swear it's like nothing ever seems to happen in San Diego. That's the only place in America.

32
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,220
They've had some shakes.

33
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,180
Yeah, I guess I guess. But literally, they probably have the best track record.

34
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:24,060
Yeah. And they also have extraordinary desserts. So I think that, yeah, I think that that makes them extra special.

35
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:53,940
Yeah. And I see other folks lighting up in chat, of course, like Tiger Claw saying Florida gets hurricanes. Oh, yeah, they do. Pop Culture says we get tornadoes. Yeah. So keep in mind, you know, we were gusting 70 miles an hour. And for you hurricane pros, that's nothing. I know. But again, for us, that's how to start. I'm not I kid you not. One of the one of the neighbors solar panels was on the ground today. That's what kind of wind it was last night. And you know how well everything's built for that. So it's just pretty

36
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,580
wild. Pretty wild. Anyway, go ahead.

37
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:08,580
It's actually literally to go back to your point, though. I mean, it is a matter of of what you're used to in what the area that you're in is going to be prepared to accommodate, you know. So

38
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:21,780
that's right. And and very, very good point from Bobby Black Wolf. We're used to it, but it doesn't make it any less scary. Oh, God, like those noises I was hearing last night. I was like, Did my roof just blow off? Because it sounds like my roof just blow off. And of course, I walked outside of my okay, it's fine.

39
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,700
Now, for me, though, those sounds were comforting.

40
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:42,900
Because I know, I would always have my best sleep during a heavy storm. And at my old house that I grew up in, we had a metal awning that was right outside of my

41
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:51,780
my, my bedroom. And so wind and rain would hit it and it would, you know, and it would actually put me to sleep.

42
00:08:51,780 --> 00:09:09,540
Yeah, actually, our old old house that I grew up in, in the older part of Roseville, where I grew up for those that know the area, we had like a patio that was built attached to the house. So like we had a smaller backyard because my parents had an outdoor or like an indoor patio built and added to the house. But the

43
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:26,980
what when the water would hit that during the rainstorm, because the material was made out of it would make a lot of noise. And it was it was actually pretty comforting until that house actually flooded one year. And that's why some of the stuff gives me a little PTSD. It didn't get past the garage, but it got real close. And like all of our neighbors were affected.

44
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:49,140
I do have to say I have a very vivid memory of being four years old during Hurricane Frederick, which was a cat for hurricane. And me keeping trying to go out and watch the windows and seeing an eight really old oak tree up route in front of my house. Thus, this oak tree was probably as wide around as a minivans on its side.

45
00:09:49,620 --> 00:10:18,740
And that's like if you drive through downtown Midtown, Sacramento right now, that's like every other corner. It's it's unreal. So and it just the only thing that sucks is it would be one thing if it's like, well, we got a week of sunlight to clean up Nope, another three inches of rain tomorrow. And I know there's pictures everywhere out there. Again, I'm sorry to make this about the weather. But again, this is what we're dealing with. I'll get to games in a minute. You see a lot of pictures of the weather out there or the the bridge. I think that the the

46
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:48,300
Tower Bridge, you see a lot of that in the waters running really high, right? Like right next to Old Town, Sacramento. And like people are like, and I see things on Tick Tock where people are like Sacramento's fucked. Look at how high that river is. And there's another three inches rain coming. But the good quote unquote news is what they're neglecting is that there's a whole bypass system that's built that they haven't even activated yet. But it's getting close. So what happens is that they they open this thing called the weir and it diverts the Sacramento River into the Yolo Causeway, which is a rural land

47
00:10:48,300 --> 00:11:05,420
between Sacramento and Davis, California, where the university is you've probably heard of. And it just it floods that whole area, but it's all rice land and stuff that can resist flooding. So I don't know why they don't open it up sooner. But that's the quote unquote good news is so that my house doesn't flood. That thing exists.

48
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,260
I'll tell you what area I'm worried about. Israel, Linda.

49
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,820
Yeah, well, yeah, that's the place that flooded in the 90s. For sure. And then the same the same area that flooded on New Year's Eve.

50
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:30,940
The construction over in this area will in the area outside of that basically created a floodplain where there wasn't one. So more human involvement changing ecosystems.

51
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:59,860
Oh, boy. All right. Well, speaking of the future, I'm actually surprised no one has pointed this out yet. But maybe because I've done a personal stream and some folks maybe saw this hanging out and I was just on Bobby show and we were talking about it. But let me mention here on on Orange Launch Radio, especially for the podcast listeners. Behind me as we tape live tonight, I now not only have a Burger Time arcade one up machine, but I now have a bigger brother, a Tron arcade machine is next to it.

52
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:19,140
And that was what I built. Pretty much right. I think it was just about ready to go. Oh, no, I was building that instead of doing OLR on New Year's Day. Like, while I was listening to Bobby, I was actually building the machine. So I was working on that most of the most of the night on Sunday. So but you see, it's all set up now.

53
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:48,860
I do really enjoy the machine. Long story short, it I did not realize that is and you could actually probably see it right towards the top of the marquee is this is actually a black light in the machine. And I realized it actually replicated that I thought because the way other time I've seen this machine was a Bobby's house, and he has external black lights. So I thought that's why I was seeing the black light effect, but the machine actually hasn't built into it, which I thought was pretty cool. And that's why everything inside it kind of glows a little more than maybe what you're used to.

54
00:12:48,860 --> 00:13:18,460
But it's a really cool effect. It's a really nice presenting machine. I mean, if as long as you can get over the fact there's only two games in it, but Tron is great. Disks of Tron, I'd maybe played one other time. And so getting to play that a lot more has been pretty cool. So yeah, so long story short, I am enjoying the machine. And that's why you see that behind me now on the feed. And that was my Christmas present from Alan, who got it half off on a Black Friday sale. That's kind of why it was like, because you know, the machine was really

55
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:47,940
expensive when it first came out, but half off. That's pretty good deal. So Bobby says I need your arcade one up username so I can add you. Sure. It's just Rob Roberts. I'll one word, Rob Roberts. If you do add me, make sure I have your username, of course, Bobby Black Wolf, but any other folks out there who happen to have a Tron cabinet, I'm happy to add you to the gallery here. Because this is the newer, BurgerTime doesn't do this. BurgerTime was right at the tail end before these machines started getting online on the internet, and now they have online leaderboards.

56
00:13:48,140 --> 00:14:17,460
But that is literally the only thing this thing does is online leaderboards. It does it. It's not like multiplayer online or anything else. It's just the leaderboards. I believe like there's a Mortal Kombat release that they put out not long ago rerelease that you can play it online. I hear it doesn't run very well. But that's I haven't experienced it firsthand. I don't know. But yeah, you can do online leaderboards. But basically what you're doing is you're creating a filter saying I want to see these people.

57
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:46,740
And it'll filter for those people. Bobby Black Wolf says NBA Jam was the first online one. Well, then that's, that's not too surprising. It went to Mortal Kombat as well, because those were all Midway games back in the day. And I think Warner has licensed all that now. So they're probably, you know, they the arcade one up has put out a lot of Namco, a lot of Capcom and a lot of Warner at this point. So, but it's cool that they got this Disney one. So you know, looking forward to see what else they do. You know, they did they did get The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle, they have old Konami games.

58
00:14:46,740 --> 00:15:16,700
There's a lot of people, myself included, that would love to see a Konami classic classic Konami classic cab with stuff like time pilot, gyrus, Contra, heck haunted castle, if we could go there, although that that game is hard as fuck a haunted castle, of course became Castlevania if you didn't already know, but the original haunted cancel cap. Why can't I talk to me? The original haunted castle is fucking hard. It is it is disgustingly difficult game, but I would love to see like

59
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:46,660
a, oh, Dr. Seuss says they did Frogger. I didn't even realize that. But yeah, I would love to see the Frogger. Of course they did Frogger. But like a time pilot and gyrus and all that would be great. Bobby says last week, one of my AMA questions was what would your ultimate arcade one up be? And I actually said they should make a home beat mania machine, put sound vortex on it, whatever. I would love to see that too. But unfortunately, they're not going to do it. It'll tell you why they're going to be competing against themselves with 2DX Infinitas and some of the online offerings they're doing so they're not going to want to do that.

60
00:15:46,700 --> 00:16:05,780
But yes, dreamboat answers, of course, build the online version into that cabinet to play it and then people would pay their subscription. Nobody is smart enough to think of that Loki. Let me give you the ideas Konami since you don't have them yourself. Also, I think there was a cabinet with time pilot pilot in it. I bet it was the Frogger cabinet.

61
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:35,740
And maybe I need to take a second look at that cabinet. I probably just laughed it off because it was Frogger. But I love Tom pilot. It has gyrus too. I mean, let me check. But I would I would love a DDR replica cab. I mean, I don't I they could make assault, they could make it a solo machine. They could literally sell like a solo machine as an arcade one up type of thing. But anyway, that's a discussion for another day. Let's get into our official kickoff topic tonight. I know we've been talking literally about the weather and that sort of thing. But let's get into it.

62
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:58,820
But I do want to get into some other topics, including since we didn't end up doing a show on New Year's Day, we haven't had an opportunity to look back at the best of 2022. And look forward to our official predictions for 2023. Which, admittedly, we've been slacking on the predictions a little bit ever since we went virtual and the pandemic and all that stuff. We're going to bring them back this year and actually do some predictions.

63
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:13,900
So looking back on to 2022, I want to kind of go around and see, what were your favorite games of the year? And maybe any additional highlights you want to share with the crowd? Loki, I'll pick on you first.

64
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:36,900
My favorite games of the year, I didn't play a whole lot, obviously. So really, my highlights probably going to be Goat Simulator 3. I think that was a great sequel. It's still rode that balance of really broken and yet polished. A lot more polished than it was before. And I still need to go back and play it somewhere because they have been doing regular updates to it.

65
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:51,900
So it's really going to hit its stride once it hits Steam because it's one of those Epic Store exclusives. And that'll be when all the modding support comes in. I'll buy it again, of course. The other game, of course, that's been fun to play this year is Power Washing Sim.

66
00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:06,900
So Power Washing Simulator is just really fun and relaxing to play through. And I'm glad that they keep adding stuff to it as well. And of course, Minecraft. But you know, you've heard me talk to death about Minecraft. What can I really say?

67
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
It's still going and that's worth noting.

68
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:48,900
And it's like, okay, what is it, though? Well, you know, it's, it's, it's about creativity and making the world your own and telling stories. And like, that's what that's what Minecraft is already.

69
00:18:48,900 --> 00:19:18,900
Well, we can't want to make a roblox. Like, what are they? Well, no, I mean, they don't want to make a roblox. I think they're going to try to like, stuff that you can build more lore into or something like that, things you can interpret. It's a bunch of excuses that they don't want to just share what they're doing. Because if they don't get it done, people get upset with like the 4k graphics pack. Well, well, yeah, that too. But no, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're

70
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:48,900
they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're,

71
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,580
and you're like, oh, wild, all done.

72
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,020
It's like, but that's the only one by him.

73
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,100
He said you were going back in

74
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,580
and like revitalizing all of them

75
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,580
and making them feel more lively and you didn't do that.

76
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,060
So obviously people were disappointed,

77
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,940
but they're like, no, no, no, we never promised anything.

78
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,540
We just showed you concept art.

79
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,440
And then now they're like, well,

80
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,600
we can't show you concept art

81
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,060
because then you're going to think it's coming.

82
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,720
It's like little babies,

83
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,920
like their marketing team is just awful

84
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,420
when it comes to just communicating stuff.

85
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,460
And now they just don't, they just have shut down

86
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,540
and we're just not going to tell you anything then

87
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,180
because then you're just going to get your hopes up.

88
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,320
It sounds like, I don't know.

89
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,220
It sounds like a bad parent, actually.

90
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,740
Like I can see, like if you're a bad parent

91
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,360
trying to like, well, I'm fine, Billy.

92
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,500
I'm not going to promise you anything

93
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,740
because then I'll just disappoint you.

94
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,020
So I don't know.

95
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,400
That wouldn't be the first time I've heard that excuse.

96
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,160
It's just like, it's stupid is what it is.

97
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,920
So now we have like no idea when the update's coming,

98
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,020
what the update is.

99
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,400
It's like, they're not showing anything, which is fine.

100
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,460
Like you can do that.

101
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,920
Like when they did another update,

102
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,280
which is probably the best one that they've done,

103
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,120
it was like in 2020.

104
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,760
And what they did with that is like, they just said,

105
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
okay, all of a sudden, boom, here's everything.

106
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
And everyone's like, whoa, this is really cool.

107
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,520
And yeah, you know what?

108
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,280
There were things that they showed off in that probably

109
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,880
that were implemented in the game.

110
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,980
And that's fine.

111
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,580
People understand.

112
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,860
But if you just like say,

113
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,700
if you promise like all this stuff

114
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,620
and then give you something that's like 10% of that,

115
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,980
plus something that was like,

116
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,220
should have been in there updates ago,

117
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,580
because that's what you promised.

118
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,500
YYR puts it perfectly in chat who says,

119
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,060
never ever promise the kids the broccoli farm,

120
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,260
unless you're certain you can deliver the broccoli farm.

121
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,660
Exactly, exactly.

122
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,900
Like it's just, and it's fine.

123
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,820
Like people are reasonable and they'll understand.

124
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,660
I mean, some people are unreasonable,

125
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,740
but like the majority of people are reasonable enough

126
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,120
to know that like, okay, I get it.

127
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,700
Like you couldn't, there's the pandemic.

128
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,300
Yes, I understand that there was the pandemic

129
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,140
and all that stuff.

130
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,580
And this update that you're talking about was really big.

131
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,800
And so you couldn't get it done in the timeframe

132
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,060
that you wanted, because it was a lot more complex

133
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,860
than you initially thought, which is also once again,

134
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,980
a stupid idea to promise something that quick a turnaround

135
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,340
when you don't even know the scope of it yet.

136
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,580
So then like, that's understandable.

137
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,700
But that was two years, now three years ago, okay.

138
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,340
Pandemic's been over for a while.

139
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,820
People have gone back to work.

140
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,100
It's not.

141
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,700
I understand it, but like they are now,

142
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,620
they can't use the excuse,

143
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,280
well, we're just not used to working remote.

144
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,820
Okay, it's been three years that you've been working remote.

145
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,100
You're used to it now.

146
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,140
Okay, so I don't wanna hear excuses about like,

147
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,420
oh, well, it's the pandemic is why we couldn't do it.

148
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,080
No, it's because your poor planning

149
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,000
is why you couldn't do it.

150
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,840
And that's fine.

151
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,980
Lower your scope down,

152
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,060
make it clear and understandable what's coming.

153
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,460
Perhaps don't start a third game.

154
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,300
There you go.

155
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Like they're making Minecraft Legends right now,

156
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,340
which is another game that like,

157
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,100
the more I see of it, the less interested in it I am.

158
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,820
They have Minecraft Legends, Dungeons, and now this.

159
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,380
It's just, if your resources are spread so thin,

160
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,900
then don't do that.

161
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,980
Lower your scope down.

162
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,100
Whatever, we'll just,

163
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,200
we just have to wait for them to tell us what it is.

164
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm sure in the summer or something will come out.

165
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,060
Yay.

166
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,680
All right.

167
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,220
Dark Sakura, looking back on 2022,

168
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,980
what were some highlights for you?

169
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,700
Dead by Daylight?

170
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,400
Cause it had new chapters.

171
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,020
Except I hate Wesker and I hate the night.

172
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,460
Now for new games, I actually played,

173
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,180
I played all the way through Cult of the Lamb,

174
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,100
which I had such a fun time playing.

175
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,420
That game is messed up and so fun and cute.

176
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,380
And also I started playing Marvel Midnight Suns.

177
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,260
I played on my Monday stream and I really liked that game.

178
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,260
I can't wait until we get more people into the group

179
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,180
and they do some really good stuff about the group dynamics

180
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,540
for the people that were already there

181
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,220
versus the Avengers joining up.

182
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,500
And now I have Spider-Man in there

183
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
and he's absolutely perfect.

184
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,880
And I'm having a really good time with the game.

185
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,140
Good.

186
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,180
Yeah, that's all I have to say about that.

187
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,180
I mean, I haven't really had many other things come out

188
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,040
that super interested me, you know,

189
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,140
but those two were the big ones.

190
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,100
Quest Buster in chat says, yay, Midnight Suns.

191
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,060
I finally finished my campaign a few days ago.

192
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,940
So good.

193
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,040
You know, in the Marvel department,

194
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,460
I hear a lot of people really hyping up Marvel Snap.

195
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,300
Is that what it's called?

196
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,140
Yeah, there's people who are into it.

197
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,740
It's not my kind of thing.

198
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,300
Gotcha, I just see a lot of people on,

199
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,980
especially Mastodon where I'm at now

200
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,220
has got a few people I follow in there

201
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,400
that are super into Marvel Snap and hyping that up.

202
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,200
So it's like the Marvel license is thriving

203
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
in gaming right now.

204
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,180
That's certainly something to take away from 2022.

205
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,880
That's for sure.

206
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,600
Okay, so let's talk about my game of the year.

207
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,660
So I'm gonna pick something.

208
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,060
I actually don't think this one is too like outside the box

209
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,140
or too like against the grain,

210
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,540
but this is what I consider the game of the year to be.

211
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,540
And I know a lot of people, you know,

212
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,660
think it's God of War, Ragnarok, which is fine,

213
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,460
which is, or Elden Ring, which is fine.

214
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,320
Admittedly, I haven't really sat down

215
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,060
and spent a lot of time with either of those games

216
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,340
in part because I still don't have a PlayStation 5,

217
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,380
although it sounds like maybe I can finally get one soon.

218
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,820
We'll see.

219
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,920
But just also in part that, again,

220
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,460
the genre that Elden Ring is located in

221
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,320
has not yet still convinced me to join it.

222
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,400
And maybe that's, you know, my own hardheadedness.

223
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,540
I don't know.

224
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,140
But I actually would make an argument

225
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,020
that there was another game that came out

226
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,280
that I actually think did something so well,

227
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,700
it supersedes both those games in my,

228
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,940
I could tell you, I could play both of those games

229
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,300
thinking, just going into them,

230
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,740
knowing they're probably 10 out of 10 games.

231
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,220
And there's still another game I would probably say

232
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,380
would truly represent the game of the year.

233
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,380
And some people are probably gonna say I'm incorrect

234
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,260
because this game technically launched

235
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,820
in like December of 2021,

236
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,340
but it didn't launch launch

237
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,140
until the middle of the year this year,

238
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,780
or more a little late in the year.

239
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,940
So I think most people probably discovered it this year.

240
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,500
And I think some of you probably are figuring it out.

241
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,020
And I will say, I think the game of the year

242
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,020
is the bargain basement, appropriately priced,

243
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,020
way underpriced game that provides so many hours of value

244
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,820
that created a whole new genre.

245
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,820
And that game is Vampire Survivors.

246
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,420
I think that is the best game in 2022.

247
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,340
I wouldn't say that's a new genre.

248
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,940
Oh, oh, the Survivor genre.

249
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,500
Look at all of the knockoffs.

250
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,320
I mean, I get that it's rooted in a roguelike.

251
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,940
So that's probably where your feelings come from.

252
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,780
I'm gathering some-

253
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,900
Stuff like Smash TV.

254
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,460
Yeah, but Smash TV and the way the power-ups branched

255
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,020
and the way you work through the game.

256
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,380
I mean, I think what it did very well

257
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,180
is it merged all these concepts together.

258
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,940
It's kind of like it created something new

259
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,660
by taking the very best from all these other tapestries.

260
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,940
And not only did it do it, like it did it so,

261
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,020
like it's a small,

262
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,420
it's only one or two people that made that game,

263
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,140
super duper on the cheap.

264
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,700
And look at the news about how they pretty much

265
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,380
were forced their hand to put that on mobile devices

266
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,180
because everybody started ripping it off.

267
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,940
And even now I start to see all these ads on TikTok

268
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,780
or whatever I'm watching that are basically

269
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,940
rip the Survivor something.

270
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,660
Survivor this, Survivor that.

271
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,620
And we're not talking about the TV show.

272
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,660
We're not talking about a Destiny's Child song.

273
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,860
We're talking about this trend

274
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,420
that Vampire Survivor started.

275
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,940
And now we have games like Soul Stone Survivors

276
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,580
that I think are also very good

277
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,140
that kind of take that idea of the progression

278
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,060
and the randomness of a roguelike

279
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,140
with the action of a Smash TV

280
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,820
or a twin stick shooter, basically.

281
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,620
Because some might say that like Returnal

282
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,220
also does this very well.

283
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,700
But I think Vampire Survivors,

284
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,620
especially when you consider how much it costs

285
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,660
and how prolific it got is why I would say

286
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,220
that was probably the best game of the year.

287
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,060
In my opinion, it's my opinion.

288
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,020
So looking in chat, Dartusia says,

289
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,500
oh yeah, Vampire Survivors is at least top three.

290
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,660
I just bought Super Smash TV on Super Nintendo.

291
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,420
Michi said she remembered playing it, so it's coming.

292
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,380
In 5th Dreamer Greaves, Vampire Survivors is amazing.

293
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,780
Dartusia also saying, I don't blame you on Dark Souls.

294
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,980
I tried it, I couldn't get past the first mid-boss,

295
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,500
so I swore off soul stuff.

296
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,860
See, meanwhile, Alan, my other half,

297
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
loves those soul games.

298
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,820
So that's like his jam.

299
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,460
Yeah, and more power to him.

300
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,780
I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum.

301
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,700
That's my favorite game of the year, personally.

302
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,540
You can't change that.

303
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,800
So this is what it is.

304
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,580
S2100Matt says, I get what Rob is saying.

305
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,700
It's how it's implemented.

306
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,860
The core idea is not new,

307
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,660
but the implementation in this creative way

308
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,860
is kind of revolutionary.

309
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,580
Yeah, yeah, I think that's another good way of saying it.

310
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,460
So there you go.

311
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,540
That's my hot take on what probably

312
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,980
the best game of the year was.

313
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,540
As far as like, well, let's talk about now,

314
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,620
looking forward, like 2023, what do we think?

315
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,100
Let's make some off-the-wall predictions.

316
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,780
So I'll just say, let's do like three predictions.

317
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,820
We'll go around and each,

318
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,140
I think that's the way we used to do it.

319
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,060
We'll each go around and give a prediction,

320
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,860
and I will put it into a PowerPoint presentation,

321
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,620
since I don't have a jar that we can look at

322
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,740
at the end of the year and see what came true

323
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,620
and what didn't.

324
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,880
I would invite those of you in chat

325
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,060
over at twitch.tv slash vog network

326
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,860
to give your suggestions,

327
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,380
because if we can't think of something,

328
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,680
we might pull from our chat room

329
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,500
over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

330
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,340
So-

331
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,220
We could do a variant of it.

332
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,060
What's that?

333
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,500
The 2023 wishlist.

334
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,220
You wanna do a wishlist?

335
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Yeah, why not?

336
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,700
Because some of my predictions have to do with things

337
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,380
that I don't think are gonna land well.

338
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,240
And it's not that I wish it on that,

339
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,920
but I'll tell you what my wishlist items are, but yeah.

340
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,620
One of them has to do with something not doing well.

341
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,220
So I wanna leave it, in fact, actually,

342
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,820
I think two of mine are perhaps construed negative.

343
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,160
I think one of them would actually ultimately be positive,

344
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,260
but we'll get to that.

345
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,060
So let's go around the table.

346
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,940
Loki, what's a prediction you have for 2023?

347
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,800
2023, hmm.

348
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,300
I think that, well, we're getting into a story

349
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,340
about something that's not gonna be short-handed

350
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,860
anytime soon, or apparently this year,

351
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,780
it's supposed to be readily available,

352
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,500
but that's only because the other thing

353
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,660
that's coming out this year, the PlayStation VR 2,

354
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,780
is gonna be impossible to find and scalp to death.

355
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,060
And there'll be shortages for that all year round.

356
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,100
So PSVR 2 impossible to find,

357
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,940
probably the safest bet you could take

358
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,500
when it comes to predictions.

359
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,340
Yeah.

360
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,380
I'm gonna go ahead and follow that, Jamie.

361
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,700
I hope you don't mind if I go out of order,

362
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,180
but that's because my next one

363
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,700
also has to do with the PSVR 2.

364
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,260
And I'm gonna be as bold to say,

365
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,980
I think the PSVR 2 is a flop.

366
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,820
I think the PSVR 2 does not move

367
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,900
the same type of numbers as the first one.

368
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,540
And I think there's multiple factors

369
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,260
that come into play this time.

370
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,340
I think number one, I don't think there's a launch title

371
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,100
that's gonna entice people.

372
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,620
I'm not saying they're bad.

373
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,100
I understand many of you have very passionate feelings

374
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,700
about the Dark Pictures anthology shooter,

375
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,540
and rightfully so.

376
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,300
I'm not paying $1,000 though for that.

377
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,420
That's the thing, it's like that console,

378
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,320
I had to get a PlayStation 5, which is like $500,

379
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,960
a PlayStation VR 2, which is $550.

380
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm sorry, it's a great game.

381
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,120
I really wanna play it, not paying $1,000 to play it.

382
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,880
I actually think this is where some of the competitors

383
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,320
such as, you know, I'm not supposed to call it Oculus Rift,

384
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,160
but I'm going to,

385
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,480
because I still hate the name meta for the company,

386
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,600
but the Oculus Rift and some of the standalone VR devices,

387
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,240
I actually think they have a bit of an advantage here.

388
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,860
This wasn't the case the first time around

389
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,380
with the PlayStation VR, and I just think as well,

390
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,080
it also comes into those supply and demand issues.

391
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,180
I think there's gonna be a little bit of both.

392
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,140
I think it's that it's gonna be impossible to find.

393
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,700
They are not able to make a lot of them,

394
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,940
but I think at the same time, I think come the holidays,

395
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,740
they're not gonna move as many of them as they'd hoped to.

396
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,820
I think it's just gonna flop.

397
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,260
And I'm sorry, again, I don't mean to be negative,

398
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,580
or I'm not wishing that it's gonna flop.

399
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,100
I just think the math for this launch

400
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,300
doesn't add up the way it did the first time

401
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,100
with the original PlayStation VR.

402
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,060
I think the competition landscape looks a little different.

403
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,400
I'm not sure there's that must-have title

404
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,740
out of what we're seeing in the launch lineup.

405
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,940
I think if people want to play Horizon Zero Dawn,

406
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,520
Horizon Video West, they're gonna go play those games.

407
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,380
I just don't think, again,

408
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,720
I don't think there's that VR experience

409
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,660
that people are begging for.

410
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,420
YYR says, my prediction is that it sells out

411
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,660
its initial launch shipment and then not much else.

412
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,620
The tech looks amazing,

413
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,840
but Sony is not supporting it properly with AAA games.

414
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,980
Where is Spider-Man, Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted?

415
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,660
Bingo, that is exactly it.

416
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,580
On top of that too,

417
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,280
like you look at just people's financial situations.

418
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,360
We're in like a recession.

419
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,040
People are just gonna drop $550

420
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,360
after they dropped $500 for that console.

421
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,940
Like that's a tough sell.

422
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,140
And especially considering that that's more expensive

423
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,220
than say getting a MetaQuest 2 or something like that,

424
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,340
where that's a more affordable option

425
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,340
and you have PC titles, which there are tons of,

426
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,540
and you can get for much cheaper.

427
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
Like, I just, I don't know.

428
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,580
Like I said, I really do want to play

429
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,780
that Dark Pictures game.

430
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,700
I'm holding out that they put it on PC at some point.

431
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,440
And if not, then so be it.

432
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,720
I mean, I have Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,

433
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,400
but like I haven't used my PlayStation VR in years.

434
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,760
I haven't used my Rift in years,

435
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,520
although I keep buying games for it though still,

436
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,400
but I plan on it at some point,

437
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,520
but I haven't used my PlayStation VR for a while

438
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,020
and it's very dated.

439
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,900
It's just sad that I can't like use that on PC.

440
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,120
Like, poor Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, please.

441
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,500
Put it on the PC.

442
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,800
I think the one other thing I have to say,

443
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,640
I think, you know,

444
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,940
cause as much as I think Meta is actually unique,

445
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,520
I think now we're seeing why they got into VR

446
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,000
in the first place.

447
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,640
And also like, again, if Meta takes it a step further,

448
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,280
and I don't understand why they're not doing this more yet,

449
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,840
but maybe it's coming, I don't know,

450
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,800
and offers more experiences in VR

451
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,640
and is able to sell VR to the Facebook audience.

452
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,980
And let's be real, the Facebook crowd

453
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,700
and the PlayStation crowd are,

454
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,860
some of it overlaps, so not all of it right now.

455
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,440
I actually think Meta is a little more uniquely positioned.

456
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,440
However, there is a cloud looming all over all of this

457
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,260
because there is another VR device.

458
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,280
And if this VR device, A, is real,

459
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,400
and B, launches in 2023.

460
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
Eventually, whenever it decides to come out.

461
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,320
The quote goes, it is over for you hoes.

462
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,840
That is the quote for everybody else.

463
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,420
Exactly, because they're gonna come out and be like,

464
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,480
look it, we invented VR.

465
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,640
It's the first time you could ever experience it

466
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,000
because we came up with it.

467
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,320
If Apple puts out a VR device,

468
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,580
quote, it is over for you hoes.

469
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,580
That is my official, you know what,

470
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,260
that's my sub prediction.

471
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,140
If Apple puts out a VR device, it is over for you hoes.

472
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,000
That's what I'm writing on the card, all right?

473
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,840
All right, let's move on

474
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,220
because I think Dark Soccer probably has something

475
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,860
that is not VR, but maybe she'll surprise me, I don't know.

476
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,500
Dark Soccer, what's a prediction in your camp?

477
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,360
That the Google Chromebook cloud gaming system

478
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,060
is going to bomb.

479
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,040
Oh, do I sense a little stadia bitterness?

480
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,100
I'm not sure.

481
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,940
Tell me about this prediction.

482
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,620
That was a thing.

483
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,860
They're the ones who analysis a week

484
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,060
after saying they're getting rid of stadia.

485
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,900
So I'm just calling it like I see it.

486
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,900
People aren't gonna want to buy a whole laptop

487
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,920
just for cloud gaming and certainly not a Chromebook.

488
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,340
I mean, people are gonna want a good computer

489
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,640
to play good games on, you know.

490
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,700
I just don't see it successful.

491
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,460
I 100% agree with you because I'm also just,

492
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,180
no, nobody should support a Google gaming device

493
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,560
knowing their track record at this point.

494
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,180
Nobody should be buying that.

495
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,340
My money back.

496
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,420
Yeah, that's true, that's true, at least there's that.

497
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,820
And I think that they might think,

498
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,500
oh, well, that's gonna make it all better

499
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,060
and we're gonna do this announcement.

500
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,980
Some of us really enjoyed the platform, you know?

501
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,780
It was a good way, especially like those games

502
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,940
that like when they came out,

503
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,740
they were all like glitchy and stuff, you know, Cyberpunk.

504
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,540
I didn't have like a problem with it.

505
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,480
It played beautifully.

506
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,140
I mean, I did, Boosteroid kind of failed for me

507
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,900
because their servers just were fairly weak

508
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,460
and I'm on G-Force on like the middle program

509
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,160
and that one's doing just fine.

510
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,300
But at the same time, it's like that whole thing,

511
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,300
just to come out with that announcement right afterwards,

512
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,620
there's gonna be people who are gonna lobby against it,

513
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,520
number one, people who are more bitter than I am.

514
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,460
And then on top of that, there's just like,

515
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,620
I already have all of this computer stuff.

516
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,860
Why do I wanna buy another one just to play games on?

517
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,700
Exactly.

518
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
If they're gonna do that,

519
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,300
they're gonna get a Steam Deck.

520
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,140
Yeah, exactly.

521
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,580
And that's the thing, it's like you look at,

522
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,420
it's not necessarily just like a Google-developed device,

523
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,820
it's more of like they're trying to sell Chromebooks

524
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,140
a little bit more.

525
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,420
And I mean, you look at the Chromebooks that they offer,

526
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,780
like at least the one they highlight

527
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,700
on the official Google page, the cheapest one's $3.99.

528
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,620
I mean, you might as well just buy a Steam Deck

529
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,460
at that point.

530
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,860
You can do the cloud gaming on there

531
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,260
and you can get Steam games

532
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,980
and you can hook it up as a regular PC

533
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,340
and be able to run a lot of decent stuff.

534
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,560
No one should be messing with Chromebooks.

535
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,200
You're literally like my grandparents

536
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,240
who just check emails and maybe read the news and that's it.

537
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,120
That's the only reason you would need a Chromebook.

538
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,800
And even then, I would just suggest to get a tablet.

539
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,320
It just doesn't make sense.

540
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,920
I mean, seriously, all someone needs

541
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,480
is an iPad Pro and a keyboard and you're set.

542
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,440
Yeah, you don't need a Chromebook.

543
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,980
It's a weird sell.

544
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,880
It's like a Windows phone.

545
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,400
I sold my laptop when I got my iPad Pro

546
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,040
because it did everything my laptop did

547
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,960
and I have a Mac Mini to work on all my other stuff.

548
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,640
So yeah, the whole thing is just janky.

549
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,120
All right, there's a lot of chat going on

550
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,460
about the VR thing and that whole thing.

551
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,500
And I just want to,

552
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,600
because I thought it was a good comment here.

553
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,760
GZDR4EV says, you don't want to watch

554
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,960
The Last of Us TV show or the Twisted Metal show in VR.

555
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,200
Personally, maybe I do,

556
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,380
but not enough people to make a device like that,

557
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,140
like sell, sell, sell would be interested.

558
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,760
And it's a hard truth, I'm sorry.

559
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,840
However, again, because this company

560
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,520
knows how to make an entrance,

561
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,220
if Apple were to unveil one of those devices,

562
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,920
I'm telling you, they're going to have people

563
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,820
watching the new Avatar movie in it.

564
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,960
And even if you personally don't like that answer,

565
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm telling you, look at the box office,

566
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,860
look at the track record.

567
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,900
It's going to move beaucoup.

568
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
If, you know, again, this is all, you know,

569
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,220
we know it's something they're-

570
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,060
Print money.

571
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
Yeah, we know it's something they're experimenting with.

572
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,440
We don't know when, we don't know where,

573
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,780
we don't even know if it'll actually happen.

574
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,900
Experimenting with it doesn't mean

575
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,180
they're ever going to do anything with it.

576
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,940
So, but yes, print money.

577
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,600
Yeah, you know that question mark, question mark,

578
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,400
question mark, step one,

579
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,540
Avatar in 3D home device,

580
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,220
question mark, question mark, question mark, profit, okay?

581
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,380
Apple has a team dedicated to that question mark,

582
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,820
question mark, question mark right now.

583
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,140
And either they're going to figure it out or they're not.

584
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,500
And that's where it goes from here.

585
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,020
Anyway, moving on, back to the gaming producer bit,

586
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,180
just since the chat is dominated with that talk,

587
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,060
I wanted to acknowledge that.

588
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,340
Okay, so back to predictions.

589
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,880
Loki, what's another one?

590
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,700
Let's see.

591
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,900
I think that-

592
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,820
And don't forget chat.

593
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,420
We are looking for your predictions too.

594
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,580
So don't forget to holler some of those out.

595
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,820
I think that the Activision, Blizzard,

596
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,100
Microsoft merger is never going to go through.

597
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,780
And what, why doesn't it go through?

598
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,740
Because they'll try to make an example of them somehow.

599
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,100
I don't know why they'd be punishing that,

600
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,940
entertainment company.

601
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,060
But the way I see it is like, it wouldn't go through.

602
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,220
And then when it doesn't go through,

603
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,580
Sony will try to buy them.

604
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,340
They'll try to buy Activision, Blizzard.

605
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,580
That is so shady, but I could see it.

606
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,900
Absolutely, I could see it.

607
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,960
So by the way, if y'all hear me typing,

608
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,620
it's because I am officially recording our predictions

609
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,460
to the record.

610
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,820
So please excuse my mechanical keyboard noises in the back.

611
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,140
All right, let's go, I guess I'll just go next

612
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,500
since I kind of created that order last time.

613
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,620
So my number two, okay.

614
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,180
Again, I hate to be negative,

615
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,300
but I think it's one of those things at the end of the day

616
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,480
is going to benefit this company at the end of the day.

617
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,780
And my prediction is that

618
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,940
Yoshisuke Matsuda is forced out of Square Enix.

619
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,500
I think all this talk about NFTs,

620
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,300
I think the way the general company's been kind of run,

621
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,980
and I think ultimately,

622
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,740
I'm not saying Final Fantasy XVI doesn't do well,

623
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,320
but I think the way the company has kind of failed

624
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,700
to respond to some of these issues,

625
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,220
such as the lack of diversity in the game.

626
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,380
And I know there is a subset of gamers probably

627
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,440
that don't listen to this show,

628
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,980
but there's probably a subset of gamers out there

629
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,260
that roll their eyes when I say that.

630
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,180
And my answer to that is, tough titty,

631
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,400
because this does ultimately impact sales.

632
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,920
People want to see themselves represented in games, period.

633
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,800
And although I still stand by

634
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,880
that this is a Japanese game industry problem,

635
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,340
here's the problem.

636
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,560
Now Square Enix is the poster child for that problem,

637
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,560
because Matsuda has failed to deflect the issue

638
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,380
or respond to it in any way, really.

639
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,380
And although I think Final Fantasy XVI does fine enough,

640
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,380
I think this is something we're gonna be reminded of

641
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,380
in many interviews, many reviews, many things,

642
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,500
that some would say it starts to be a distraction.

643
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,280
It's not a distraction, I wanna be clear,

644
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,740
but some would say that, especially in Japan.

645
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,420
And I think ultimately Matsuda-san,

646
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,340
between that and the NFT issue,

647
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,660
and I think this whole sale of the other stuff

648
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,640
with now that we know Crystal Dynamics

649
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,700
is making a Tomb Raider thing for Amazon,

650
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,340
I think all of these things are gonna be viewed

651
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,500
as poor fucking decisions

652
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,860
that we're trying to set the company up for being acquired,

653
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,780
and I don't think it gets acquired,

654
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,120
especially if what Loki just said plays out,

655
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,380
Square Enix is gonna get left at the altar

656
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,060
so that Sony can buy Activision Blizzard.

657
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,700
Of course, does that mean Microsoft buys Square Enix?

658
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,680
I don't know.

659
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,300
I kinda don't think Square Enix is bought this year,

660
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,700
and I think Matsuda-san pays the price for that

661
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,320
because the good thing

662
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,200
about the Japanese game development culture

663
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,020
is that it holds its leaders accountable,

664
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,540
unlike a certain Mr. Kotek.

665
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,700
So I think Matsuda pays the price

666
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,760
and leaves Square Enix this year.

667
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,340
That's my thought.

668
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,340
So, DarkSakura, do you have something more positive?

669
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,140
Speaking of Kotek,

670
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,740
I think one way or another,

671
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,340
the company's going to be purchased,

672
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,740
and not only is he going to find himself out of a job,

673
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,620
I have a feeling that there are gonna be

674
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,620
even more legal proceedings against him personally.

675
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,220
You know, people are gonna dig up dirt.

676
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,100
He deserves to have everything thrown at him

677
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,100
and buried for it.

678
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,940
Maybe that's wishful thinking,

679
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,900
but I would love to see a crusty,

680
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,580
horrible man in power just suffer.

681
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,100
That's all.

682
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,380
Can't say I would,

683
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,660
I mean, the only problem is

684
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,380
he'll just laugh on his bed of money the whole way out,

685
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,740
and so that sucks,

686
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,740
but I do agree that the name should not be looked on fondly.

687
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,380
The history books can still record

688
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,220
somebody's name a certain way.

689
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,020
I want to see him completely lose

690
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,980
just any semblance of future business opportunities,

691
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,380
all because of this.

692
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,220
That'll never happen.

693
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,060
He'll get promoted.

694
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,380
He'll leave the company and go somewhere else

695
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,980
and be super god of whatever company it is.

696
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,780
Fucking men.

697
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,140
Sorry, don't mean it that way, but-

698
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,980
No, I get it.

699
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,500
I sort of, yes.

700
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,420
I think to what Loki's saying,

701
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,420
I do think he ends up on the boards of certain companies,

702
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,660
but I think the companies he ends up on the boards of

703
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,940
are just kind of like,

704
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,620
they're gonna be fucking NFT companies

705
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,060
and things that are bullshit anyway.

706
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,340
Like that's how I sort of see it playing out.

707
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,500
Not gonna have any meaningful opportunities.

708
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,340
Right.

709
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,020
All right, let's go-

710
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,100
Of course, I have another idea,

711
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,780
but I'm not gonna say it loud.

712
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,580
All right.

713
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,620
No, it's not violent.

714
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,620
All right, fair enough.

715
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,940
Okay, let's go.

716
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,300
One more prediction from everyone.

717
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,140
Loki.

718
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,220
All right, so I'm gonna give you two

719
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,780
just because one's gonna be runner up

720
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,100
because it's more of like a wish

721
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,940
and I know it's never gonna come true anyways, but-

722
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,020
You can always break the rules around here.

723
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,860
That's fine.

724
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,860
That's fine.

725
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,860
So my official one is gonna be that

726
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,180
Nintendo's gonna finally announce that new console

727
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,500
that they've got cooking up.

728
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,620
It's not coming out until next year though.

729
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,780
I guess that's awfully safe,

730
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,260
but it'll be right around the corner.

731
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,060
So there's that.

732
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,180
And then my second kind of a wish

733
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,780
that I would wish would happen is

734
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,420
the cocaine bear game is gonna be insane

735
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,260
and it's gonna be awesome.

736
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,900
And I just hope it comes out.

737
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,100
Except they're not making a cocaine bear game.

738
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,220
And that's a very,

739
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,280
I absolute missed opportunity right there.

740
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,120
I'm telling you.

741
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,400
They're not making a Megan game either.

742
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,240
And let me tell you-

743
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,060
I know.

744
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,260
That is one of the best movies I've seen

745
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,100
in a long time.

746
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,060
I want to see that.

747
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,580
I want to see that.

748
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,540
I want to see cocaine bear.

749
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,500
And I still want to see violent night at some point.

750
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,940
I just can't, you know,

751
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,540
probably end up having to watch it on streaming.

752
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,980
So quick aside,

753
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,900
because you know I love me a good Shane story here on OLR.

754
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,820
You know, my friend, Shane,

755
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,580
who's guested on my stream and has been on this show

756
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,500
time and time again over the years.

757
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,260
He told me he was going to go see Megan with some friends.

758
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,260
And I'm kind of like,

759
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,160
I don't know if that is going to really be up Shane's alley,

760
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,060
but I'm like,

761
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,960
I'm dying to know what you think of Megan.

762
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,700
Please call me as soon as you leave the theater.

763
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,520
And he did.

764
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,040
He called me and he's like,

765
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,980
that wasn't a horror movie.

766
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,820
That was a comedy,

767
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,860
but it was funny.

768
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,700
It looks funny.

769
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,100
And I would say that it isn't really a horror movie.

770
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,940
It's a comedy.

771
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,780
It's like,

772
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,700
see my favorite horror movie is Elvira,

773
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,860
Mistress of the Dark.

774
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,060
And that's what most people would say.

775
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,420
That's not a horror movie.

776
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,680
That's a comedy.

777
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,140
And it's like,

778
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,360
yes,

779
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,200
but it's,

780
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,680
I think horror can be anyone's genre.

781
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,600
Yes, it is.

782
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,120
There can be funny horror movies.

783
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,960
Exactly.

784
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,820
And it's even funnier if you just kind of close your eyes

785
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,820
for just a second and imagine it's not Megan, the doll,

786
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,400
it's Michelle Tanner.

787
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
It's even funnier.

788
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,620
All right.

789
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,980
Dark Sakura, like seriously,

790
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,020
I will see it again if you need a date.

791
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,860
Just saying.

792
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,640
I have a couple of things that I want to see.

793
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,480
That one was on the spot.

794
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,300
We should do that.

795
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,220
We'll do a triple date.

796
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,060
Come on.

797
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,900
I would love to see that movie.

798
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,740
Triple date.

799
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,560
Yay.

800
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,400
I'd love that.

801
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,220
All right.

802
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,340
When was the last time the three of us hang out

803
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,260
in the same physical space?

804
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,100
When we,

805
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:29,940
I don't know.

806
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,900
I remember when the last times we went on a triple date

807
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,740
was to go see the original Avatar.

808
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,100
So it would be really fucking funny

809
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,740
if the next time we go on a triple date

810
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,540
was to see the counter-programming to Avatar.

811
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,380
I still haven't seen it.

812
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,200
Yeah, I still.

813
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,380
I do actually want to see.

814
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,980
I'm mildly interested in Avatar, the new one.

815
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,140
I hear it's good, but that was the way I felt

816
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:51,980
about the first one.

817
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,380
The first one I was like, eh, I'm okay.

818
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,060
And I saw it and I was like, it's all right.

819
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,340
I'm waiting for Blu-ray

820
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,220
because I know I'm going to need a poop break

821
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,180
with that movie.

822
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,300
Like, let's be real.

823
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,980
That movie is long.

824
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,660
I just went on streaming that one.

825
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,800
Yeah.

826
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,640
All right.

827
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,900
Let's see.

828
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,620
Pod culture says, OLR, the movie review podcast.

829
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,460
You never know.

830
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,740
You know, we have a TikTok now.

831
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,380
We could record these adventures to the movies.

832
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,200
I'm just saying.

833
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,040
All right.

834
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,120
My turn.

835
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,960
Okay.

836
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,020
Oops, sorry.

837
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:28,020
Somebody actually posted something that's very adjacent

838
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,520
to what I'm about to say, which is, it is a good thing.

839
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,040
And I'm going bold.

840
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,580
I'm swinging for the rafters with this prediction.

841
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,640
But I think we have a big year for games.

842
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,620
That's not the prediction.

843
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,660
That's the truth.

844
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,100
We have like Starfield.

845
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,860
We have a new Zelda game coming out.

846
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,620
We have Final Fantasy 16.

847
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,940
We have Diablo four.

848
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,180
Like we have game after game after game.

849
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,420
This is a huge year for games.

850
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,500
And you know what?

851
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,420
As long as everybody else is getting in on it,

852
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,800
my prediction is Valve releases A3.

853
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,700
It's 2023.

854
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,540
It is time.

855
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,700
Valve releases A3.

856
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,960
What three?

857
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,800
That's up to them.

858
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,300
And I'm not going to go that far.

859
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,720
Although some would argue Half-Life Alyx was a three,

860
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,100
but we're not going to go there.

861
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,180
I'm going to say Valve.

862
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,420
There's no three in the title.

863
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,260
It doesn't count.

864
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,500
It releases A3.

865
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,300
Yeah, if there's no three in the title, it doesn't count.

866
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,540
Unless, as Bobby Blackwolf says, that title is Megan.

867
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,420
That will count.

868
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,740
Which of course is M3GAN.

869
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,020
A Valve Megan game will absolutely count, period.

870
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,380
Just putting that in the footnote.

871
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,020
But otherwise, yes, it must have a three.

872
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:41,980
We must have Left 4 Dead 3, Half-Life 3, Portal 3,

873
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,920
like any of these will work.

874
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,720
All right.

875
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,640
In 2023, this is the year to do it.

876
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,340
You have a three in the year title.

877
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,500
Yeah, as two and a half Matt says,

878
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,340
we can keep predicting three with Valve.

879
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,220
At some point, it will come true.

880
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,140
And the time they will announce it?

881
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,980
E3.

882
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,340
I don't know.

883
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,180
I'm not convinced.

884
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,940
I would take a Team Fortress 3.

885
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,860
I really would.

886
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,060
I think it'd be fantastic.

887
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,940
Hell yes.

888
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,220
And like, I would argue Overwatch is vulnerable.

889
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,620
Like, I'm not gonna say, like, I'm not talking shit.

890
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,340
I enjoyed Overwatch 2.

891
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,640
I would just say, I don't think Blizzard

892
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,640
is the king of that hill the way it's assumed they are.

893
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,700
And I think a Team Fortress 3

894
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,920
could absolutely disrupt things severely.

895
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,960
And, I don't know how funny,

896
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,320
people are talking about Steam Deck 3.

897
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,880
I'm not sure Steam Deck 3 counts,

898
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,100
but I think Steam Deck is just motivation for them to do it.

899
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,940
So.

900
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,160
I'll just do Counter Strike Go 2.

901
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,000
You're like, dammit.

902
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,160
Yeah.

903
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,160
Phil of Nine in chat says,

904
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,080
I played Overwatch 2 for a month and was like,

905
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,080
wait, this is the same game as Overwatch 1.

906
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,680
I mean, if you want to get technical,

907
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,960
it's 5v5, not 6v6, huh?

908
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,160
But I get it.

909
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,120
Cause I also played for a month and now I'm like,

910
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,000
okay, like that was cute.

911
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,460
So I would absolutely check out a Team Fortress 3.

912
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,800
I think y'all laugh,

913
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,880
but that absolutely could be the game.

914
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,480
And it counts cause a three would be in it.

915
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,300
All right.

916
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,000
Last but certainly not least, Dark Sakura,

917
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,340
a bold third prediction,

918
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,240
bold third three prediction from you.

919
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,880
I don't know.

920
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,120
I really don't know.

921
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,620
I literally cannot think of anything.

922
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,940
Jamie's prediction.

923
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,440
I literally can't.

924
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,440
How about you predict a killer for 2023 and.

925
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,780
Is this Jason's year?

926
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,820
Well, I have a list and a few of them

927
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,620
have some substantial evidence behind them.

928
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,380
So I am hoping that we get Candyman.

929
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,980
That would be amazing or, or a pumpkin head.

930
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,720
But actually what I see happening,

931
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,820
and this also may be wishful thinking is that I think

932
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,700
they're going to do even more retooling of the game

933
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,660
to remove any benefit from camping and tunneling.

934
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,640
I think just in general, it needs a rework.

935
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,800
They need to skip a patch cycle to just work on the game.

936
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,640
Like it's.

937
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,160
The thing is that new players are doing it.

938
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,400
You see it really heavily at rank reset

939
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,680
and they think that this is how you're supposed to play.

940
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,040
And sorry, kills do not equal skills.

941
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,360
It means you are cheap and lazy.

942
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,720
So let me answer this in chat

943
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,600
because I'm going to take this question seriously

944
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,760
and give you a serious answer.

945
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,680
So Tiger Claw in chat says, how about Megan as a DLC?

946
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,720
And as much as I want to jump out of my seat and go, yes,

947
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,720
yes, it's not going to happen.

948
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,680
I'm going to tell you why.

949
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,520
Because go back.

950
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,640
She's a child.

951
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,360
There's that Android, but yes, I know.

952
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,040
Cause the ring is also a child.

953
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,320
She's not, but she's not a child.

954
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,440
She's 19.

955
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,640
Oh, I thought she was a child.

956
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,480
All right, anyway.

957
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,100
No, that's only in the, in the crappy,

958
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,600
horrible American version and the Japanese version.

959
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,440
Okay, thank you.

960
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,240
The whole story is of her going to be an actress,

961
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,080
how she kills her acting troop,

962
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,560
goes back and her dad kills her.

963
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,840
Well, I just always think of the, I'm sorry,

964
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,040
but she has the best hooking emotion in the entire game

965
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,120
where she has to lift them up and the hook comes down

966
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,840
because she shows sword and then goes back up.

967
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,200
It's so funny.

968
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,600
Anyway, but I love Sadako.

969
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,040
But Sadako is canonically a young adult.

970
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,880
Okay, fair enough.

971
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,680
S2 and Hunter Matt says, what about the Babadook?

972
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,960
For Pride Month, I totally take him.

973
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,120
Oh, I want to go back to the Megan thing

974
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,480
and why not?

975
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,080
Because of Shane's review.

976
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,000
It's not a horror movie, it's a comedy.

977
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,720
And I think ultimately that is,

978
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,520
that is what it boils down to.

979
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,080
If they're going to give us that,

980
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,760
then they should give us the comedy

981
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,000
that would be an even better,

982
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,400
I'm going to say yes, this would be even better

983
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,560
for Dead by Daylight.

984
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,600
Evil Dead though.

985
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,960
Oh, no, when I say comedy,

986
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,240
I mean we need Brenda Meeks from Scary Movie.

987
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,080
That's the one that we need.

988
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,560
The rumor was for the longest time

989
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,320
that we were supposed to get Sidney

990
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,040
when we got Ghostface,

991
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,760
except it's just the Ghostface

992
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,440
and not, you know, the movie character.

993
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,520
Also, I think unfortunately

994
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,480
with what Nev Campbell's going through,

995
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,520
I mean, I...

996
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,840
Yeah, I mean, I'm just said in general.

997
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,000
But there's no, I mean,

998
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,240
Jenny Ortega is literally everywhere right now.

999
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,800
There's no reason her, I mean,

1000
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,960
I know I should bite my tongue immediately

1001
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,600
that I ever say, you know, Sidney is replaceable.

1002
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,720
She's not, but let's be real,

1003
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,160
we didn't get Heather Lagenkamp with the...

1004
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,880
Because they did the new version.

1005
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,920
They did the new version.

1006
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,600
So I would say you'd have a better chance

1007
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,840
of getting Jenny Ortega,

1008
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,160
I can't remember her name in the screen, sorry.

1009
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,000
Was it Sam?

1010
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,840
No, Sam was the other person.

1011
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,640
I didn't, I don't like those movies.

1012
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,240
But anyway, especially because her particularly

1013
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,200
between that and Wednesday,

1014
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,120
she's having a real good year.

1015
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,280
She had a really good 2022.

1016
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,680
Season two, baby.

1017
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,640
Can't wait.

1018
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah, she's having a good year, so.

1019
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,400
If you want the, you know, the feel of Harry Potter,

1020
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,600
but you don't wanna support Harry Potter,

1021
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,880
Wednesday's your ticket.

1022
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,120
That is a glowing reveal, actually.

1023
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,040
I mean, it's basically Harry Potter.

1024
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,040
It's except without, you know.

1025
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,520
Without transphobia. Transphobia.

1026
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,920
I, and I love, I've always loved the Addams family.

1027
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,000
So I'm here for that.

1028
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,840
It's great.

1029
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,280
I love that series.

1030
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,320
We made our kids watch it and it's great.

1031
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,040
To go back though,

1032
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,040
I think that some of these rumored licenses,

1033
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,720
we are going to start seeing them around.

1034
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,000
Candyman has been teased for a while

1035
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,840
and the actor of the original Candyman

1036
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,600
was approached to work with behavior.

1037
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,400
And they're often saying that they'll work

1038
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,360
on their chapters sometimes years in advance.

1039
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,280
Yeah.

1040
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,120
I would, I would love, I mean,

1041
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,280
I was right about Wesker, wasn't I?

1042
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,600
Well, it wasn't too hard to predict, but yes.

1043
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,840
Yeah, but I mean, we had Nemesis first

1044
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,760
and I was like, it's gonna be Wesker.

1045
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,560
I also am thinking that there's going to be

1046
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,960
a new, another graphical overhaul

1047
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,560
for some of the areas that hadn't,

1048
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,320
or that maybe were overhauled a little bit longer ago.

1049
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,600
And I certainly think that the stupid Borga area,

1050
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,520
the Knights area is gonna be changed.

1051
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,520
It looks terrible.

1052
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,880
It looks like old Cornwind.

1053
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,360
All right.

1054
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,200
So let's put them in, lock them in.

1055
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,480
So here are the recaps one more time.

1056
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,320
PSVR2 impossible to find.

1057
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,160
PSVR2 flops.

1058
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,200
Google Chrome game book bombs.

1059
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,160
ABK Microsoft merger doesn't go through

1060
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,160
and an example is made of them.

1061
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,040
Matsuda forced out of Square Enix.

1062
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,520
Kotick forced out of the working world completely.

1063
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,360
Nintendo finally announces new console

1064
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,400
for what they're cooking up next year.

1065
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,800
Cocaine Bear game is insane and awesome.

1066
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,800
Valve releases a three, literally can't even,

1067
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,920
I'm still putting that in there

1068
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,400
and DVD Candyman or Pumpkinhead were the,

1069
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,040
kind of the first two that I picked up there.

1070
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,360
So, all right, there you go.

1071
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,120
Cause I think it'd be funny to look back.

1072
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,360
Why did Jamie predict literally can't even?

1073
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,240
Is that a prediction?

1074
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,080
Because I couldn't.

1075
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,800
I mean, and there's gonna be new chapters, you know?

1076
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,240
I mean, we even are talking about other changes

1077
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,320
coming to Dead by Daylight,

1078
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,760
rumored with very reliable resources.

1079
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,960
Get to that in a little bit.

1080
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,080
Meanwhile, probably speaking of Dead by Daylight,

1081
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,080
let's get to what we've been doing this week

1082
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,360
in our gaming weeks.

1083
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,680
So let's get to, how was your gaming week?

1084
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,520
Dark Sakura.

1085
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,160
I played Dead by Daylight.

1086
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,040
I actually played Killer.

1087
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,880
Oh yeah, I peeked at your stream for a little bit

1088
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,440
and I saw you playing Pig and I was like,

1089
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,720
oh, she's back on her pig bullshit.

1090
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,960
Rob, that pig game?

1091
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,520
Adept first try.

1092
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,160
Oh, good job, congrats.

1093
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,840
Right after that, Freddy, Adept first try.

1094
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,480
Lucky you.

1095
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,800
I almost got Adept for Nemesis

1096
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:24,680
because I actually got a 3K and the hatch

1097
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,840
and someone managed to, no, I didn't get the hatch.

1098
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,560
It was in Cornwind, so it was really hard to find the hatch.

1099
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,960
So someone got it.

1100
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,960
But it was a pretty solid 3K, that one.

1101
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,840
And I got a lot better with his tentacle power.

1102
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,520
But I had a really shitty pyramid head game

1103
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,120
and people were just being children.

1104
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,400
And so I was like,

1105
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,040
well, I'm gonna go play another pyramid head game.

1106
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,760
I got to get another 20 seconds of chase in.

1107
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,840
And that's when the power went out, end of my stream.

1108
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,480
I had gone a whole hour longer, so I'm not mad about it.

1109
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,520
But I hated that it was on that terrible pyramid head game.

1110
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,240
I'm a little worried for you tonight, though,

1111
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,880
because I think the rain starts around 10 o'clock, 10 30.

1112
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,280
So fingers and toes crossed

1113
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,960
you make it through tonight's stream after the OLR.

1114
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,680
See, I'm gonna be doing,

1115
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,800
I mean, tonight is quite likely gonna be

1116
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,080
a survivor night anyway,

1117
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,160
unless Gwen doesn't wanna play.

1118
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,720
And other than that, then I'll find ways of doing things.

1119
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,240
I'm still trying to work through my Adepts

1120
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,040
and if I may say so,

1121
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,120
I'm doing a subathon on Friday the 13th,

1122
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,200
starting noon to midnight.

1123
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,240
Yeah, I picked it on purpose.

1124
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,800
It's also like the weekend before I go back to work maybe.

1125
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,800
So if you wanna see the shenanigans, come on by.

1126
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,160
You might even get to play with me.

1127
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,400
I'll try to make a cameo.

1128
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,480
I have to work Friday, of course, but I'll try to-

1129
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,120
Well, it's going until midnight.

1130
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,960
So you got time.

1131
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,800
Okay, I got time in the evening.

1132
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,320
I have to travel Friday too,

1133
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,160
assuming there isn't another fricking storm

1134
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,440
because apparently they're all back to back to back.

1135
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,720
But anyway.

1136
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, it is what it is.

1137
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,840
It is what it is.

1138
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,600
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

1139
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,960
It was all Minecraft again.

1140
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,560
So I finished up an episode and put that out.

1141
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,120
And now I'm working in my modded series too.

1142
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,120
I need to film something for that.

1143
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,920
I've been just actually playing it.

1144
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,320
So more to come.

1145
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,760
All right, my gaming week.

1146
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,880
I've continued on my MMO stuff,

1147
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,680
but now I'm kind of doing equal time

1148
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,360
with Final Fantasy XIV and WoW.

1149
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,600
And I have to say,

1150
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,240
I kind of thought I hit the point where I was kind of like,

1151
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,600
okay, I think I'm done with WoW

1152
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,440
just because I ran out of things to do.

1153
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,960
Like I beat the main campaign.

1154
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,160
I'm not interested in really raiding and all that stuff.

1155
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,040
And I was like, eh, I could do mythics,

1156
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,240
but I don't really know if I'll get a group or whatever.

1157
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,600
And then like out of the blue,

1158
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,160
I'm on during world quests and Extrofer from Horde House,

1159
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,200
his husband is playing right now

1160
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,400
and like sent me a message and went,

1161
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,960
hey, you want to heal a mythic for us?

1162
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,800
And I was like, all right, sure, I'll try.

1163
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,200
And I'm like, I'm not very good.

1164
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,040
I don't know how it's going to go.

1165
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,000
He's like, whatever, whatever, let's just do it.

1166
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,640
And sure enough, we changed like four mythics.

1167
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,560
We got my keystone all the way to level eight.

1168
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,720
We beat, or we actually got it all the way to level 10

1169
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,960
because we beat Temple of the Jade Serpent on level eight.

1170
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,160
And I thought that was neat too.

1171
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,200
I didn't realize they throw classic dungeons, just a few,

1172
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,280
but like Temple of the Jade Serpent from Pandaria

1173
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,360
and the Shadow Moon Burial Grounds from Draenor

1174
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,400
are like actually in the classic rotation

1175
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,480
of mythic dungeons.

1176
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,400
I thought that was pretty cool.

1177
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,640
So, cause that's something I've kind of wanted WoW

1178
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,720
to do for a while is bring back their old content

1179
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,640
in a meaningful way.

1180
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,080
And they're actually kind of doing that.

1181
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,760
So I'm going to give them kudos for taking that feedback.

1182
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,320
But then Final Fantasy has a big patch on Tuesday

1183
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,360
and I'm prepping for that

1184
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,520
because Island Sanctuary is getting updates

1185
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,120
and I love Island Sanctuary.

1186
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,520
So I'm really excited about that.

1187
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,920
So yeah, MMO, MMO.

1188
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,640
Did I play anything that wasn't an MMO?

1189
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,640
Yes, I dabbled with Portal, the original,

1190
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
but you might remember they recently re-released it

1191
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,400
as Portal with RTX.

1192
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,800
And I was curious, I was like,

1193
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,280
oh, I wonder I have a newer machine.

1194
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,600
I wonder how that's going to run.

1195
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,800
So I fired it up and it turns out it's the first game

1196
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,560
that my nice brand new computer

1197
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,720
kind of chokes on a little bit,

1198
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,760
at least in 4K, which yeah,

1199
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,600
you want to do 4K RTX, okay, look, I know.

1200
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,880
My graphics card is pretty good, but it's not that good.

1201
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,680
But I can play in like 2K pretty well.

1202
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,200
So that was fun.

1203
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,400
So, you know, Portal's a standby old favorite.

1204
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,400
I'm glad they're still making that game look good

1205
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,640
all these years later.

1206
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,280
I wish they would just do a three, but okay.

1207
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,920
Put a fresh coat of paint on the classics.

1208
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,960
At least I didn't have to pay anything for it either.

1209
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,200
It was something that was just included

1210
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,320
because I own the original Portal.

1211
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,160
So that was nice.

1212
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,520
So, s2100matt in chat says,

1213
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,440
my gaming week was MagFest.

1214
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,480
I'm so curious how that was this year.

1215
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,520
You'll have to tell me more about how MagFest went.

1216
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,800
I'm curious if you were there too while they are.

1217
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,200
Maybe you didn't go this year

1218
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,920
because I know you have your daughter and all that yet now.

1219
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,280
I don't know if you still go to MagFest,

1220
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,000
but I'd be super, super curious

1221
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,680
how that was for those that went.

1222
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,800
So, oh, he posted a bunch of pics and vids

1223
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,560
in a thread in our conventions channel on Discord.

1224
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,000
I did see some of the pics,

1225
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,440
but I didn't see all of the videos.

1226
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,280
Hold on, hold on.

1227
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,960
Let me, we'll do it live.

1228
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,800
Let me do this.

1229
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,960
I'm going to go here and I'm going to go to conventions

1230
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,920
and oh, we're not seeing anything.

1231
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,760
I'm sorry.

1232
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,740
Let me try to figure out what's going on over here.

1233
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,600
Sorry, folks.

1234
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,820
Oh, I think this is because of the update they just did.

1235
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,660
There we go.

1236
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,900
Okay, yeah, this is interesting.

1237
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,680
So they have some actual machines that are there.

1238
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,100
Yeah, I did see some of these.

1239
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,820
So I saw that there's like plenty of sound

1240
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,820
Voltex machines that they have set up and said,

1241
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,220
wow, like three Step Maniacs cabs.

1242
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,420
So they were set for the music game fans.

1243
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,580
Ooh, there's some Pokken for.

1244
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,700
I just got one of those nearby too.

1245
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,420
They opened up a brand new arcade here

1246
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,860
in the Folsom outlets

1247
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,620
and they've got a Step Maniacs there

1248
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,660
in the groove three, totally legit.

1249
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,140
Do you know why that arcade is totally loaded?

1250
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,260
It's probably either from the Rockland one

1251
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,140
or from the drive-in, I'm guessing.

1252
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,420
It is the same guy who stocked the Rockland one

1253
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,820
in the drive-in that actually runs that arcade.

1254
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,260
So that arcade is gonna be a hotspot.

1255
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:30,100
Oh, neat.

1256
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,500
Someone doing a speed run of Portal

1257
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,640
with Ellen McClain doing commentary.

1258
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,940
That's pretty awesome.

1259
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,780
Bye.

1260
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,620
That's awesome.

1261
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,940
I do actually have some other local news.

1262
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,100
Oh yeah, what's that?

1263
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,780
The game room is having a new arcade director.

1264
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,740
Oh, really?

1265
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,520
That's all I know about it,

1266
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,380
but apparently Joe is gone.

1267
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,220
Interesting.

1268
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,560
But yeah, I was gonna say, speaking of Ellen McClain,

1269
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,780
I was really taken with how much GLaDOS inspiration

1270
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,900
there was in Megan.

1271
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,140
That was pretty impressive, for sure.

1272
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,780
Let's see, some indie arcade games.

1273
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,260
I'm not gonna go through all of these videos,

1274
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,540
especially live.

1275
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,160
Typing party arcade game.

1276
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,140
This is a rock, paper, scissor game

1277
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,140
where you have to protect your fort

1278
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,360
from flying rock, paper, and scissors.

1279
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,300
What is this?

1280
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,600
Typing party.

1281
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,760
This looks kind of fun.

1282
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,740
I'm waiting for the actual action to happen.

1283
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,060
Oh, here we go.

1284
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,700
Oh, so you're actually typing the word

1285
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,520
that goes with the rock, paper, scissor.

1286
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,380
Oh, that's clever.

1287
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,300
So it's like you're on two sides

1288
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,820
and they're throwing things at each other

1289
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,780
using the rock, paper, scissors mechanic.

1290
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,660
All right, that's clever.

1291
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,540
I like that.

1292
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,860
Thank you for that video.

1293
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,040
And let's see, Pin City.

1294
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:53,880
What was the one?

1295
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,700
You said something in chat.

1296
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:58,780
Oh, a pinball walkthrough for dark soccer, I guess.

1297
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,660
And any pinball fan out there.

1298
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,240
It is hard to make out some of these machines,

1299
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,620
but I see a Godzilla.

1300
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,340
There we go, the lighting kicked in there.

1301
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,180
Okay.

1302
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,180
So it's-

1303
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,300
Did you play Weird Al?

1304
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,780
Was there a Weird Al?

1305
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,460
Oh yeah, was there a Weird Al?

1306
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,500
If Stern had a presence there,

1307
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,980
not Stern, but a P3.

1308
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,540
Anyway, thank you for the videos.

1309
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,420
It looks like the gaming area is still hopping.

1310
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,140
Oh God, you'll have to go

1311
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,340
because he sent like seven pinball videos.

1312
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,880
Unfortunately, I can't play them all live,

1313
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,220
but yeah, wow, it looks like it was hopping over there.

1314
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,140
Holy goodness, like BeatMania machines

1315
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,600
right up next to each other, like several of them.

1316
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,660
Yeah, it looks like Magfest was pretty off the hook.

1317
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,080
There's a lot of interesting collectibles in there too.

1318
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,920
All right.

1319
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,160
If you want to go through the channel later on,

1320
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,720
and I suggest you do, head on over to our Discord channel,

1321
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,260
vognetwork.com slash Discord,

1322
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,840
and you can actually look for that thread

1323
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,920
in the conventions channel.

1324
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,960
There's a thread, you kind of hover over it

1325
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,860
and you can see Magfest 2023 photos, videos.

1326
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:01,800
Thank you, Matt, for uploading that.

1327
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,760
Really appreciate that.

1328
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,360
And by the way, since we didn't have an OLR last week,

1329
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,240
may I say congratulations and mazel tov, Matt,

1330
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,880
on your engagement, because that happened.

1331
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,320
So thank you for, that reminded me to say that

1332
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,720
because we weren't here last week, so.

1333
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,280
And s2100matt says, no Weird Al, sadly.

1334
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,640
Lexi Light Speed was a pretty cool newer to me table, so.

1335
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,440
Lexi Light Speed is a pretty fun one, I have to admit.

1336
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,780
I had a lot of fun with that one.

1337
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,320
There's some others that I don't like,

1338
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,280
but my top two, Weird Al is at the top

1339
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,380
and then Lexi Light Speed.

1340
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,240
Dr. Studio says, yeah, I'm sad we don't have any cons

1341
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,580
like that near us outside San Diego Comic-Con,

1342
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,260
but that's a bit out of our price range.

1343
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,760
They used to have a big one.

1344
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,180
I don't think it was Barstow, maybe it was Riverside,

1345
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,820
but it was somewhere out in Inland Empire.

1346
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:52,540
They had like a big, but they liquidated that whole thing.

1347
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:53,380
Remember that?

1348
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,200
It was somebody who brought it up on the show

1349
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,580
that they were kind of keeping an eye on that

1350
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:57,900
as that was liquidating.

1351
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,820
But yeah, probably the closest thing you have right now

1352
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,840
is California Extreme, that I know of.

1353
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,440
I'm sure Southern California must have

1354
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,740
some arcade collectible community there

1355
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,820
that maybe we just don't know where the show is yet.

1356
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,180
But anyway, we got to move on.

1357
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,220
We got to get into the news this week.

1358
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,860
There still are a few things that happened,

1359
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,780
so let's get into it.

1360
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:21,620
Some pretty big news headlines to kick off 2023, right, Loki?

1361
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,740
Yep, there's actually things this week.

1362
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:30,200
So first off, we've got another studio that is unionizing.

1363
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,580
So the Blizzard studio that has worked on, I guess,

1364
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:37,140
the World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight.

1365
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:44,660
It's Proletariat announced that they're, I guess,

1366
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,420
planning on unionizing on.

1367
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:48,980
They announced that on Tuesday.

1368
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:51,760
And they have 60 employees.

1369
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,820
So they have the new Proletariat Workers Alliance

1370
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,860
and is unionizing with the Communications

1371
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,980
Workers of America.

1372
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:06,240
And they said they have a super majority of support

1373
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,440
among their qualifying staff at the studio.

1374
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,840
And let's see what their vision statement says here,

1375
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,940
what they're looking for.

1376
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,920
They said, let's see, they want to fight

1377
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,800
to ensure there are progressive human-first benefits

1378
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,280
such as flexible PTO policy, remote work

1379
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,780
as a permanent option, and robust health care,

1380
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:32,560
open and transparent communication over compensation,

1381
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,360
and pushing to pay employees a thriving wage,

1382
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,200
clear, equitable, and actionable processes

1383
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,760
and resources for workers to attain their career

1384
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,080
goals such as professional development,

1385
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,280
pass to promotion, and raises.

1386
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,600
Overtime is never mandatory.

1387
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,600
And refusing doesn't affect performance evaluations.

1388
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,300
Transparent process by which management and workers

1389
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,840
can hold each other accountable without fear of retaliation.

1390
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:03,480
And a culture and policies prioritize DEI

1391
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,200
in every level of decision making

1392
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,920
and support underrepresented groups

1393
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,760
so that we can build the most diverse and equitable AAA game

1394
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,520
studio in the country.

1395
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,520
Cool.

1396
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,920
And apparently, there hasn't been any pushback on it

1397
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,440
so far, so.

1398
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,680
There won't be for Microsoft.

1399
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,440
They've made it pretty well known.

1400
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,960
Well, not Microsoft, but you know.

1401
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,080
Oh, regulatory, right.

1402
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,840
Well, Activision Blizzard, you know, doing their busting.

1403
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,920
They have no choice.

1404
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,240
And they know it.

1405
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,400
This is where it's going, you know.

1406
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,000
And because if they were to push back,

1407
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,840
it could fuck their whole deal with Microsoft.

1408
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,880
They can't.

1409
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,840
So it is what I think.

1410
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,840
And this is going to be the first of many you

1411
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,440
see this coming year, that's for sure.

1412
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,880
Yeah, I think I'm surprised it's so few so far,

1413
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,160
but it's just momentum.

1414
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,840
Once you see more studios going this route,

1415
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,960
then more will follow.

1416
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,240
Yep.

1417
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,080
All right, well, moving on to our next story.

1418
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,520
It is the first week of the year,

1419
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,560
first full week of the year.

1420
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,280
And that means, of course, Awesome Games Done Quick

1421
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:04,760
is back.

1422
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,440
And Awesome Games Done Quick is doing their 2023 speed run

1423
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,040
marathon.

1424
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,960
They're going to be debuting some new speed runs this year,

1425
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,360
including Stray, Splatoon 3.

1426
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,560
Of course, a lot of these games just came out, right?

1427
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,720
Powerwash Simulator, that's going to be interesting.

1428
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,080
And Neon White, yeah, are all debuting this year.

1429
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,200
So that's pretty cool.

1430
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:26,800
The event runs from today, the 8th, through January 15th.

1431
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,800
This is all online.

1432
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,280
You may or may not remember, originally,

1433
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,840
AGDQ was being looked at for Florida

1434
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,120
as they had done in the past.

1435
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,640
And that was the trend in the past.

1436
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,320
But when Summer Games Done Quick was in person

1437
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,560
in the Mall of America town in Minnesota,

1438
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,680
when they did Summer Games Done Quick there,

1439
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,760
they were taking COVID precautions very seriously,

1440
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,240
probably to a further extent than you have probably

1441
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,200
seen probably any other convention at this point do.

1442
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,120
If you want to go to Bobby Black Wolf's show

1443
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,760
because he's involved with Games Done Quick

1444
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,640
with the commentating.

1445
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,280
And he went, go look for his episode

1446
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,520
that goes into all the details about how far their COVID

1447
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,360
procedures went.

1448
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,920
But you know what?

1449
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,120
They worked.

1450
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,800
You know what you didn't hear from Games Done Quick?

1451
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,880
Any COVID transmission.

1452
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,720
You didn't hear it.

1453
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,520
So precautions worked.

1454
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,960
So they took precautions.

1455
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,040
So there is that.

1456
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,880
And it does seem like Florida was not

1457
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,160
going to allow them, essentially.

1458
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,600
Long story short, I'm making a long story very, very short.

1459
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,360
But basically, Florida was not a safe place

1460
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,560
to have Games Done Quick between their options for COVID

1461
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,240
and, of course, not just that, but you

1462
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:41,120
look at Florida's governor and a lot of the holy crusades

1463
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,840
he's decided to go on recently.

1464
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,200
And it's not a safe place for people in other ways.

1465
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,240
So Games Done Quick, the virtual thing worked.

1466
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,280
So let's do that.

1467
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,320
So they're going to do the virtual awesome Games Done

1468
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,200
Quick.

1469
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,680
Anyway, some other runs.

1470
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,600
Cult of the Lamb, they're going to speed run as well.

1471
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,560
That's interesting.

1472
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,600
So that's pretty cool.

1473
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,320
It'd be too hard.

1474
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,360
Yeah.

1475
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,760
Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge, Tiger Claw.

1476
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,720
I'm sure you're going to be watching that.

1477
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:08,000
No Elden Ring, unless they're saying perhaps it's a bonus

1478
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
game, but I don't think that was on the schedule.

1479
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,840
But that's OK, because they mix it up.

1480
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,160
Of course, AGDQ is raising money for the Prevent Cancer

1481
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,640
Foundation.

1482
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,640
2022 raised $3.4 million.

1483
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,960
And yeah, they've raised over $41 million

1484
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,800
for charity since 2010.

1485
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:29,320
That is very, very cool.

1486
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,440
Bobby Blackwolf in Chat says, fun fact.

1487
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,440
Unlike previous events, bits and subs on their Twitch channel

1488
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:40,040
do not go to charity, but go toward paying the hotel

1489
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,320
cancellation fees.

1490
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,280
Wow.

1491
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,240
So it shows you how serious they were about this whole thing.

1492
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,760
So I mean, it's a bummer.

1493
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,280
You know what?

1494
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,000
But in a way, the optics of that make

1495
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,960
it look like the hotel is taking the charity's money.

1496
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,560
And so it is kind of a smart move by the Game Stunt

1497
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,960
Quick organization, to be honest.

1498
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,960
Because the hotel could have opted to just let it go.

1499
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,360
But I guess I understand there's employees and things

1500
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,320
like that that they've got to pay.

1501
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,040
So there's got to be a middle road somewhere.

1502
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:10,760
Interesting.

1503
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,600
As Jordan heard Matt talking about MAGFest,

1504
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,320
since we're talking about COVID precautions,

1505
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,040
what does that look like in 2023?

1506
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,880
MAGFest took precautions very seriously as well this year.

1507
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,760
Everyone had to be vaxed to masks at all times to enter.

1508
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,240
And for the most part, everyone followed procedure very well

1509
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,600
with mild grumbling.

1510
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:26,960
Interesting.

1511
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,600
Very interesting.

1512
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,800
By the way, speaking of our pal Bobby Black Wolf,

1513
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,840
I do want to give a shout out.

1514
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,720
Because as I mentioned, he does commentating for Game Stunt

1515
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,400
Quick and has for a few years now,

1516
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,080
ever since they went virtual.

1517
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,920
Or at least, if not the first one,

1518
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,800
the one right after that.

1519
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,840
He's been doing it for a while.

1520
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,080
And he will be participating with this one as well.

1521
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,040
If you want to tune in, I don't know how he's going to do it.

1522
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,560
Because he's going to be back awake.

1523
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,440
His first shift is coming up overnight.

1524
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,560
So probably by the time most of you have heard this podcast,

1525
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,960
you've probably already missed his first shift

1526
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,560
that took place at 3 o'clock in the morning West Coast time,

1527
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,320
or 6 o'clock in the morning Eastern.

1528
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,560
But he'll be commentating for Gun Grave,

1529
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,720
Armored Core Project Phantasma,

1530
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,680
Bomberman 64, The Second Attack, and Onimusha 2.

1531
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,440
Those runs are happening overnight tonight.

1532
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,200
Well, overnight for us on the West Coast.

1533
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,400
But this is a great opportunity for you VOG Network folks

1534
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,280
in Europe.

1535
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,280
This is very well timed for you.

1536
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,840
Or even places like Japan and Australia.

1537
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,600
This is a weird time of the clock for us in the States.

1538
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,160
But it's a very good time of the clock for those of you

1539
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:32,880
in other countries.

1540
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,200
So if you ever want to hear Bobby Blackwolf do his thing,

1541
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,640
you get a chance this year.

1542
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,400
The one you'll probably have a better chance

1543
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,640
of catching Bobby at will be Thursday

1544
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,560
at 3.30 in the morning our time,

1545
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,240
6.30 in the morning East Coast time.

1546
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,760
He's going to be closing out the awful block

1547
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,440
with bad guys at school.

1548
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,240
And Steven Seagal is the final option.

1549
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,080
Oh, geez.

1550
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,120
Which apparently has a lot of lulls behind it.

1551
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,600
So that's why that's the one that's closing out the block.

1552
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,480
And then he also gets to do a Mega Man ZX speedrun

1553
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,960
as they transition back into the less awful games

1554
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,040
part of the show there.

1555
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,600
And that is all overnight for us on Thursday.

1556
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,520
But again, for Europe, that's what?

1557
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,320
Add five hours.

1558
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,840
That's practically noon time.

1559
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,400
He'll probably be.

1560
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,160
I mean, there's always delays and things like that,

1561
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:20,160
but practically noon time for folks in GMT.

1562
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,080
So pretty cool.

1563
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,360
Good luck, Bobby.

1564
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,200
All right, let us move on.

1565
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,880
Darsakha, you hinted at this earlier.

1566
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:30,560
Yeah.

1567
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,840
So now people weren't really believing it at first

1568
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,480
until DBD leaks put out something.

1569
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,760
And DBD leaks for anyone who follows Dead by Daylight,

1570
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,760
they are some of the most reliable people for any news

1571
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,560
about what's going to be going on in Dead by Daylight.

1572
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,440
They've shown outfits before they're released.

1573
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,600
They've given, you know, like the advent calendar.

1574
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,360
I think they knew it before it was released,

1575
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,240
all of this business.

1576
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:12,480
So the PTB, the public test beta files are out

1577
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,320
and people, of course, data miners

1578
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,760
are going to look for whatever they can.

1579
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:23,920
So they were finding that his three perks,

1580
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,080
which I mean, they're very specific names.

1581
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,200
It's what Franklin's demise, barbecue and chili,

1582
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,600
and why can't I think of the other one?

1583
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,000
Knockout.

1584
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:36,880
Yeah, the one I don't use.

1585
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,480
But I mean, but two of them specifically

1586
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,160
are named after, you know, things important to the movie.

1587
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,280
So there are now, there were screenshots floating around

1588
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,680
of it saying like, I have to find a picture for it again,

1589
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,040
but it's like replacement, barbecue and chili, blah, blah,

1590
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,880
blah, rare perk.

1591
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,040
Whereas if it's specific to a character,

1592
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,760
it would say like rare, the cannibal perk.

1593
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,760
I am going to point out those saying

1594
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,160
that the stranger things characters,

1595
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,080
even though their perks were changed,

1596
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:16,400
it still has, for me at least, Demogorgon perk,

1597
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,400
Nancy perk, you know, stuff like that,

1598
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,160
even though they are supposed to be generics

1599
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,680
and act like generics.

1600
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,880
But that's the rumor of what's going on with Bubba's perks.

1601
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,440
What that means is that the theory

1602
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,000
is that behavior is going to be losing the license

1603
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

1604
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,320
which as I recall, isn't it,

1605
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,600
wasn't that their first licensed character was Bubba?

1606
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,200
Myers was, then they got Bubba.

1607
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,040
Myers was, that's right, Myers was.

1608
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,960
But at any rate, you know,

1609
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,240
but this is the character that inspired the game.

1610
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,640
I mean, the whole meat hook thing,

1611
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,040
that came from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

1612
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,240
I mean, they even had a character based off of Leatherface,

1613
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,120
you know, the hillbilly who ran around with a chainsaw

1614
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,360
and, you know, grunted a lot.

1615
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,720
Now, the other thing that gives a little bit more evidence

1616
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:22,480
to this is that in pulling the actual data for it,

1617
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,920
they have also that they're listed as Perk Barbecue Chili

1618
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,440
underscore name underscore alt.

1619
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,520
So that's indicating that particular piece of change.

1620
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,200
There is, hold on, it's going to be one other thing.

1621
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,880
I've got to find my other resource

1622
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,400
because I forgot to link it to you.

1623
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,880
It's actually this, I don't want to play the YouTube video,

1624
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,640
but it's got the screenshot that I need in it.

1625
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:56,640
It's one of the videos I follow,

1626
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,960
and he's been completely full of crap before,

1627
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,080
but is Mint Skull.

1628
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,440
There is, he had a screenshot also

1629
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:13,040
of some of the code for the licensed characters.

1630
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,120
And the piece of the code for the licensed character

1631
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:22,480
is that next to leather faces, it says license expire true.

1632
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,320
And if you look at other licensed characters,

1633
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,360
like they checked ash.

1634
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,000
Next to ash, it was license expire false.

1635
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:41,440
So in the end, they're probably going to end up doing with Bubba

1636
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,960
what they did, what they're doing with the stranger things.

1637
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,200
The stranger things content,

1638
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,720
where the character is going to be removed for purchase.

1639
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,840
He will still be in the game,

1640
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,840
but if you have not already purchased him

1641
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,520
and all of his cosmetics,

1642
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,640
you will not be able to get him again.

1643
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,360
And the going theory is that it's due to the,

1644
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,840
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game that's coming out.

1645
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,840
I mean, that was sort of what happened

1646
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,800
with Stranger Things content.

1647
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,840
Although, I mean, the rumors have been floating around

1648
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,440
about Stranger Things coming back,

1649
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,040
but some of that was disproven.

1650
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,320
I was going to say that's the one thing

1651
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,800
that DBD Leaks thus far has gotten wrong

1652
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,760
is the DBD Leaks was on this Vecna.

1653
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,640
There was reason to believe it,

1654
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:41,200
but those ended up being fan-made renders.

1655
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,120
Oh, cause I was gonna say, to be fair,

1656
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,600
and it looked legit.

1657
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,520
It could be the next DLC

1658
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,120
because they were saying it was going to be

1659
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,640
around the time the night came out,

1660
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,080
but it could just be as simple as

1661
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,880
Behavior didn't want to do two licenses back to back

1662
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,160
cause they had just done Resident Evil.

1663
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,120
And I don't think they've ever done

1664
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,240
two licenses back to back.

1665
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,440
So it could just, you know,

1666
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,880
there's a lot of things that could happen,

1667
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,800
but it could be that the Stranger Things happened

1668
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,800
just comes back with Vecna.

1669
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,280
And I think they were saying Joyce would be at all

1670
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,240
for Nancy or whatever.

1671
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:10,480
I don't know.

1672
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,760
It could be all fan-wank, who knows,

1673
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,600
but that that would all hit the game in the next.

1674
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,720
We get the cop guy, who I can never remember his name.

1675
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,960
Oh, Dommer.

1676
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,320
We could give him him and Joyce.

1677
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,360
That would be cool.

1678
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,160
It would be cool,

1679
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:24,720
but I think that,

1680
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,720
weren't they saying Eddie for the male killer?

1681
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,680
Or not male, I'm sorry.

1682
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,800
Male survivor would be Eddie.

1683
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,000
Maybe.

1684
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,720
Maybe.

1685
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:31,840
We need Barb back.

1686
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,520
But Hopper, thank you.

1687
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,920
Why would they say Dommer?

1688
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,720
You know what though?

1689
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,800
Is it like if they did bring it back,

1690
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,240
would they bring back Hawkins?

1691
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,200
So I need to go load up my Windows partition

1692
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,200
so that I can rip the content

1693
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,920
and see if the Hawkins map is still,

1694
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,520
because all up until a couple of PTBs ago,

1695
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,560
at least to my knowledge,

1696
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,640
because I haven't gone for files since then,

1697
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,160
the maps and assets for Hawkins

1698
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,920
was still in the game files.

1699
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:05,920
Of course, also.

1700
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:07,840
Oh, I was just to say,

1701
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,240
I do want to point out,

1702
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,840
because you had also pointed this out to me

1703
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,400
and I did go,

1704
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,040
Oh yeah.

1705
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:13,760
Is that, you know,

1706
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,520
with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game,

1707
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,000
you know,

1708
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,840
it makes a lot of sense why this is happening.

1709
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,440
Stranger Things games,

1710
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,080
those,

1711
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,360
I think at this point,

1712
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,960
they were probably making more money

1713
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,400
from the Dead by Daylight thing

1714
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,920
than they were from those Stranger Things games.

1715
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,920
So Netflix is probably come around on that finally.

1716
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,520
But you did make a good point.

1717
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,240
You said when the Evil Dead game came out,

1718
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,200
they didn't pull Ash.

1719
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,000
Because Bruce Campbell likes money.

1720
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,440
I mean,

1721
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,600
I'm going to be flat out about this.

1722
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,880
That's true.

1723
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,720
Back when I saw The Man with the Screaming Brain,

1724
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,840
which was a really crappy movie he was in,

1725
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,360
he was there at the Crest.

1726
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
And he was like,

1727
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:56,640
yeah,

1728
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,200
this movie here paid for my roof.

1729
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,600
This movie here got my kids braces,

1730
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,720
you know,

1731
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,800
and I was like,

1732
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,520
I was like,

1733
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,840
I don't see Bruce Campbell

1734
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,760
not allowing his likeness to be used

1735
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,640
for anything related to Ash.

1736
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,280
So that's just Bruce.

1737
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,400
That's just,

1738
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:19,680
yeah,

1739
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,080
you know,

1740
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:20,880
Bruce Campbell.

1741
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,720
He likes money.

1742
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,200
And I think it could be a timing thing, too,

1743
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,400
is that these license agreements

1744
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,120
are probably locked in for about five years.

1745
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,160
And we're probably past the five years.

1746
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,080
And now you have this Texas Chainsaw Massacre game

1747
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:34,480
coming out.

1748
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,360
It doesn't add up good.

1749
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,000
It was probably less for Stranger Things

1750
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,400
because, you know,

1751
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,920
it's got different kind of IP.

1752
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,400
But I don't think Ash has been in the game

1753
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,880
more than two years at this point.

1754
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,840
So probably even isn't playing then.

1755
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,000
Yeah.

1756
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,600
Even if Evil Dead was coming out

1757
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,400
is probably one of those things

1758
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,680
where they were locked into contracts

1759
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,240
still anyway.

1760
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:52,880
So who knows?

1761
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,280
Locopoco in chat says it's sad

1762
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,480
that the license is going to go away,

1763
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,240
but the license stuff was never guaranteed

1764
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,320
to stay forever as much as we wanted it.

1765
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,680
When DVD came to Switch,

1766
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,920
they had to renegotiate Freddy's chapter

1767
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,280
because it wasn't available with it

1768
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,000
when it released.

1769
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,720
That's a good point.

1770
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,760
I didn't realize that.

1771
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,400
You know what I would like to see, though,

1772
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,000
like as a surprise?

1773
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,200
I would like to see a classic Freddy chapter.

1774
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,320
Oh, yeah.

1775
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,520
Where we where we get like,

1776
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,680
like, say, we get Elm Street as a map,

1777
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,720
you know, with the house

1778
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,600
in the center intact and everything,

1779
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,680
kind of like the Myers house.

1780
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,960
I mean, that would be too many things

1781
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,000
that are exactly the same.

1782
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Or we have something like Hawkins.

1783
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,240
You could easily translate the Hawkins map

1784
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,040
into a big boiler room, you know?

1785
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,200
Yes to all of that.

1786
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,280
But literally just Nancy is enough.

1787
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,880
Like, literally just Nancy

1788
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,880
would make so many people happy.

1789
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,560
If they did bring out Nancy, though,

1790
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,200
I would also want Alice.

1791
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Sorry, I'm team Alice in this.

1792
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,040
Fair enough.

1793
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,200
Um, but yeah, I and you know,

1794
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,400
there's, you know,

1795
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,760
I watched some of those YouTubes

1796
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,040
you sent me a little later,

1797
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,240
and some person was kind of going off

1798
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,600
about how the loss of this license

1799
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,360
is so devastating because it kind of ruins.

1800
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:09,840
Oh, yeah.

1801
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,480
That was the multiple video, right?

1802
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,840
I don't know the whole.

1803
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,040
It's interesting how people make

1804
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,480
five minute YouTube videos out of two.

1805
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,600
But here we are with the three hour

1806
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,560
podcasts or whatever.

1807
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,000
So Turnabout's fair play.

1808
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,360
So it's just how how horrible

1809
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,320
it was going to be for the whole,

1810
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,160
like multiverse of horror thing.

1811
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,120
And I'm kind of like,

1812
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,520
look, the game still doesn't have Jason.

1813
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,920
So it's not like it really has everything.

1814
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,520
And I kind of I kind of think

1815
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,560
if DBD ever gets Jason,

1816
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,320
that's the note you go out on.

1817
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,400
Like, we got them all there.

1818
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,000
There ain't no more done.

1819
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,280
You know, even though

1820
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,480
as long as that game prints money,

1821
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,920
they're still going to keep making DLC for it.

1822
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,600
But I feel like once you have Jason,

1823
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,320
because the Friday the 13th game

1824
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,000
has got to be over five years old at this point.

1825
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,120
So I have no idea

1826
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,240
where those licenses sit.

1827
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,360
I know it's messy.

1828
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,120
But heaven forbid they can work that out.

1829
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,480
Jason coming to Dead by Daylight

1830
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,160
would be fucking huge, to put it lightly.

1831
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,960
And that's it.

1832
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,120
You don't you don't get any bigger license

1833
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,400
for DBD than Jason.

1834
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,760
And that's the note you go out on,

1835
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,400
to be honest.

1836
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,720
Would like to see Jason in the game,

1837
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,640
you know, which honestly,

1838
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,840
Trapper in my esteem is the

1839
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,400
the answer to Jason.

1840
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,200
Yeah, be a mask cleaver,

1841
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,000
that kind of stuff.

1842
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,040
So, yeah, we'll see.

1843
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:35,280
All right.

1844
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:35,680
We'll see.

1845
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,200
All right.

1846
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,000
Well, moving on.

1847
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,240
One place you can play Dead by Daylight

1848
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,000
is on your PlayStation.

1849
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,880
And Sony had a lot to say at CES.

1850
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,560
We have yet to say it during the show,

1851
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,880
but Consumer Electronics Show was this week.

1852
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,480
And usually the CES is more for

1853
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,240
literally consumer electronics.

1854
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,720
E3 was kind of spun off from CES

1855
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,920
to be specifically about,

1856
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,160
you know, electronic entertainment.

1857
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,640
CES is like new TVs.

1858
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,520
Megan dolls would fit in really great at CES.

1859
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,680
Arcade 1up usually announces things at CES.

1860
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,640
We'll get to that in a minute.

1861
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,840
But Sony sometimes does things at CES

1862
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,720
because remember all the other crap Sony does.

1863
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,320
And I say that would love all the other crap,

1864
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,040
like TVs, sound, movies.

1865
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,680
You know, Sony does get into consumer electronics.

1866
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,320
Yes.

1867
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,160
So they had some things to say at CES.

1868
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:24,720
Right, Loki?

1869
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:25,600
Yeah.

1870
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,920
They talked a little bit about PlayStation

1871
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,520
and announced a few things.

1872
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,520
So one of the things that they announced

1873
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,520
is a brand new controller.

1874
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,600
That's this Project Leonardo.

1875
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,560
And it is almost it's similar

1876
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,160
to the adaptive controller

1877
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,720
that Microsoft put out of.

1878
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,160
Well, now it's like four years ago.

1879
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,280
It looks like two spherical portions

1880
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,480
of a controller with different buttons on each one.

1881
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,320
Or I should say they're almost like paddles.

1882
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,440
They're really large and slightly customizable.

1883
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,320
I got to say, though,

1884
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,920
it doesn't look as customizable

1885
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,440
as the adaptive controller like that.

1886
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:08,160
You could really do like any possible thing you want with.

1887
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,320
This looks a little bit more constrained,

1888
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,920
but at least it's a step in the right direction

1889
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,520
to add some more accessibility to the PlayStation 5.

1890
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,560
And I'm not sure where it's going to be coming out

1891
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,520
or when it's coming out for how much or whatever,

1892
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,480
but it is something at least that they showed off.

1893
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,200
So that's cool.

1894
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,520
That's something in the right direction.

1895
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,280
Also announced that the PlayStation 5

1896
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,000
is surpassed 30 million units sold,

1897
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,880
which is surprising considering we couldn't get one

1898
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,480
and they were sold out everywhere.

1899
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,800
So I guess they're moving units.

1900
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,000
So that's good.

1901
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,120
OK, but Loki, the lie detector test

1902
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,800
on where to get those units.

1903
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,600
I don't know about that.

1904
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,080
Yeah, well, they're saying that it's going to be

1905
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,520
readily available this year.

1906
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,960
We'll see if that actually ends up happening.

1907
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,040
But because they've had unprecedented demand,

1908
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,120
they say for the console in the last two years,

1909
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,600
that's why it sold so many.

1910
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,960
And this is globally, of course.

1911
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,000
Let's see.

1912
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,320
So PlayStation 5's in stock.

1913
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:20,880
Let's see.

1914
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,600
Not there, not there, not there, not there, not there.

1915
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,600
Gee, I can't find one within 50 miles of here at a target.

1916
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,920
So I'm going to say that was a lie.

1917
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,520
Well, yeah, they're saying that's going to be this year.

1918
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,080
So I'm assuming that you got to give them

1919
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,280
a little bit of time here.

1920
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,880
But they've basically in December,

1921
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,280
they said that they've resolved their supply issues

1922
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,880
in Asian territories.

1923
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,800
But yet I don't know if it's necessarily overcome

1924
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,840
that everywhere else.

1925
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,000
So we'll have to wait and see.

1926
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,320
But that's what they're saying.

1927
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,480
I mean, they can always they could say that now.

1928
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,280
And then three months from now, they could just be like,

1929
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,440
oh, yeah, well, whoops, we I guess we're just so popular

1930
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:11,280
that I just sold out, you know, so we'll just spin it that way.

1931
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,880
All right, well, back to the good news

1932
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,720
about the accessibility controller.

1933
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,280
As to 100 Matt says, I'm so glad that Sony partnered

1934
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,920
with a lot of organizations, including able gamers,

1935
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,720
making games more accessible for everyone makes gaming

1936
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,560
better and more gamers.

1937
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,520
Yes, to all of that.

1938
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,960
That is a very good announcement out of consumer electronic

1939
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,840
show for sure.

1940
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,880
The other part of what they said to be determined,

1941
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,520
but I'm not sure I believe him yet.

1942
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,160
But we'll see.

1943
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:36,560
We'll see.

1944
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,560
They sure seem confident what they're saying.

1945
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,840
And again, I don't I don't see how the PlayStation VR 2

1946
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,680
can sell a lot of units if there's not a lot of,

1947
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,200
units out there.

1948
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,320
But anyway, moving on, let's talk about some news

1949
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,240
from arcade one up out of CES.

1950
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,760
As I mentioned, they tend to show new machines and so forth

1951
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,320
at consumer electronic show, and a little bit out of left

1952
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,440
field for their new machine.

1953
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,080
Their new machine they announced is a Wheel of Fortune

1954
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,040
casino Cade.

1955
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,720
So a lot of us, you know, the collect the classic arcade

1956
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:08,640
machines kind of look at that and go, huh, what, why?

1957
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,440
But let's be real.

1958
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,400
It is a market that is untapped yet.

1959
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,000
And there would be fans of casino games and yet they exist

1960
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,800
that would be interested in this kind of thing when they

1961
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,640
may not be as interested in a Tron or a Burger Time machine

1962
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,200
or whatever, you know, arcade one up you can think of.

1963
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,840
So it is expanding there are attempting to expand their

1964
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:30,640
audience.

1965
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,680
So it's interesting.

1966
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,400
But certainly I look at a Wheel of Fortune arcade one up

1967
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,520
and I go not for me.

1968
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,960
But you know, the sights and sounds of casino.

1969
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,280
I have a friend that's very interested in collecting these

1970
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:47,760
types of casino collectibles, because that's what he likes.

1971
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,360
And so there are people that do enjoy the fake casino

1972
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:51,760
experience.

1973
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:57,520
I mean, would they keep making poker, blackjack slot machine

1974
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,120
games for Android and iOS if people weren't eating them up?

1975
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,920
So there's a lot of people that like the fake casino stuff.

1976
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,240
So a lot of people like the real stuff too.

1977
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,600
But there's a market for this.

1978
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,040
I just don't think it's any of us.

1979
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,080
But there's that.

1980
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,840
However, maybe a little more up our alley, the arcade one up

1981
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,360
infinity game board.

1982
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,880
So that's, it's basically like a giant tablet, but a little

1983
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,520
more firm, you know, a little more for game night that, you

1984
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,680
know, you can play like a virtual Uno and things like that

1985
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,180
on.

1986
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,440
But as far as like the machine collectibles, they're going

1987
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,280
to be doing some more deluxe machines.

1988
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,280
So those are the full size arcade machines.

1989
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:36,720
They did Killer Instinct, I think was the big one at CES

1990
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:37,440
last year.

1991
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,760
So they're even bigger than the ones behind me because

1992
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,320
technically these are three quarters size on a riser.

1993
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:47,120
So the deluxe ones are like true original arcade size.

1994
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:50,160
So there's going to be a Mortal Kombat deluxe with Mortal

1995
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,080
Kombat 2 branding all over it.

1996
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,880
But that includes most of the Midway stuff from the 80s or

1997
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,560
90s, 80s around that era.

1998
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,960
There's also going to be a Pac-Man deluxe, which is basically

1999
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,680
your Namco greatest hits, you know, your Mappy and so forth.

2000
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,000
There's also going to be a Ms.

2001
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,280
Pac-Man deluxe.

2002
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,480
So they've got those rights issues sorted out where Ms.

2003
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,080
Pac-Man and Pac-Man are both available.

2004
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,720
And a class of 81 deluxe, which is the one that split on

2005
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,280
how it looks.

2006
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,000
It's got Ms.

2007
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,400
Pac-Man and Galaga in it as there was a famous arcade machine

2008
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,120
called Class of 81 that was just like that.

2009
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,240
It had him split there.

2010
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,760
So, yeah, it's funny.

2011
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,440
Like I read that wrong at first and I thought it had 81 games

2012
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,760
and I'm like, dang, the friendly stepping up.

2013
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,800
No, no, no.

2014
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:38,000
In fact, I think Class of 81 deluxe might literally only

2015
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,120
have those two games.

2016
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,480
I don't think it has much more, but the other ones are.

2017
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,280
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

2018
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,320
I stand corrected.

2019
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:48,960
12 games in Class of 81, but I don't see a list, at least

2020
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,480
not readily available for me to grab.

2021
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,800
But generally these things tend to be like a best of, you

2022
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,200
know, Namco type of thing.

2023
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,440
You know, whoever the company is on there.

2024
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,840
So looking in chat.

2025
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,520
Orange Riot is talking about the casino going, my parents

2026
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,920
love the fake slot machine games on Facebook.

2027
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,480
Yeah.

2028
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,600
And the interesting thing is, I mean, I don't know how recently

2029
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,880
any of you have been to a casino, but if you think casinos

2030
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,560
now are still pull the lever and that whole thing.

2031
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,240
Like, yeah, those games are still there, but that is not

2032
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,280
the majority of games.

2033
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,680
The majority of casino slot machine games now are like

2034
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:28,160
touch screen type of things where all the slots are there.

2035
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,480
And then the bonus round is a touch game.

2036
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,640
And that's what they're going for with this Wheel of Fortune

2037
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,120
thing, because they're kind of trying to gamify something

2038
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:38,400
that's a little harder to gamify, because I think they're

2039
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:42,160
actually putting puzzles in it, which don't exist in the

2040
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,760
actual Wheel of Fortune slot machine.

2041
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,760
But okay, whatever.

2042
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,260
So.

2043
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,280
Oh, thank you.

2044
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,520
Orange Riot says the 12 games in the Class of 81 are Ms.

2045
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:56,320
Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaga 88, Galaxian, Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2,

2046
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,400
Mappy, Rally X, Rolling Thunder, Rompers, Tower of Draga,

2047
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,520
King and Balloon.

2048
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,880
See, those games have all been in before, except I think

2049
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,560
Rompers and King and Balloon.

2050
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,760
I think now they're digging deeper, which it's weird that

2051
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:15,520
they don't do things like, what the fuck was the dragon game

2052
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,680
that was in every Namco collection?

2053
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,160
Oh, my God, you're riding on the backs of dragons.

2054
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:22,960
It's a shooting game.

2055
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:27,200
Why am I completely blanking right now?

2056
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,160
Dragon Spirit.

2057
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,760
Yeah, Dragon Spirit.

2058
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,320
I beat chat.

2059
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,200
I beat chat.

2060
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,080
I beat it.

2061
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,320
Dragon Spirit delay, delay.

2062
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,480
But I'm kind of surprised I'm not putting stuff like that

2063
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:38,960
in there.

2064
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,360
So, yeah.

2065
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,720
And Fenaris is Joust.

2066
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,000
Joust isn't Namco, but I believe Joust is on that Mortal

2067
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Combat Cabinet, because that's in the classic Midway.

2068
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,440
So, oh, sorry.

2069
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,480
Rama's right.

2070
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,000
You're not riding on the back of the dragon.

2071
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,040
You are the dragon.

2072
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,840
See, I got it mixed up with the Dreamcast thing.

2073
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,520
But anyway, I know I'm literally firing myself.

2074
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,360
All right, moving on.

2075
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:02,880
Where are we at?

2076
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:03,120
Are we?

2077
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,080
Who has this next story?

2078
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,120
Is it me?

2079
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:13,760
Oh, I missed a story in the sidebar.

2080
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,840
So I was like, what is wrong here?

2081
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,320
Yes.

2082
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,800
Dark Soccer, you're actually next with a story that is not

2083
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,600
on our sidebar.

2084
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,160
Sorry about that.

2085
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:21,620
Oh.

2086
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:23,920
User error.

2087
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,160
Oh, gosh.

2088
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:25,940
Yeah.

2089
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,120
And I was so focused on Debbie.

2090
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,360
So at any rate, Atari is announcing a new handheld,

2091
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,680
a mini arcade in-home console.

2092
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,640
It looks weird and kind of retro.

2093
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,680
It's the Atari and My Arcade releasing

2094
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,760
these three collaborations.

2095
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,720
So we have the My Arcade Atari Micro Player,

2096
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:55,760
which looks like a desktop, a tabletop arcade cabinet.

2097
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:04,720
And then we have the My Arcade Atari Pocket Player,

2098
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,480
little handheld dedicated.

2099
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,640
I mean, you've seen the My Arcades at the store.

2100
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,840
They have a lot of them like that.

2101
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,340
Yeah.

2102
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,440
Well, no, I'm talking about the little personal

2103
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,560
handheld gameplay.

2104
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,360
Those I don't have.

2105
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,560
I have the little arcade replicas, but yeah.

2106
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,060
Yeah.

2107
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,400
And I've got a bunch of those too,

2108
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,440
at least the ones that are good.

2109
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:27,280
And then the last one is the My Arcade Atari Game Station Plus

2110
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:32,240
that actually reminds me in coloration of the Atari 7800

2111
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:39,360
and a little sort of retro futuristic looking joysticks

2112
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,520
that have extra buttons and twisties on them.

2113
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:47,440
So, and they did clarify that it will include a collection

2114
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:51,680
of games from the 2600, 7800 and the arcade.

2115
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,200
What about the 5200?

2116
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,560
The best games are the 50.

2117
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,120
Fuck them.

2118
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:55,680
No, I'm just kidding.

2119
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,060
I'm pissed.

2120
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,560
But at any rate.

2121
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,720
It looks better than a flashback does.

2122
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,960
It's a nice looking thing.

2123
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,720
So we'll see what they're like when they come out.

2124
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,720
I'll reserve some judgment.

2125
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,880
Better this than that VCS computer or whatever the hell

2126
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,480
they were trying two years ago.

2127
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,600
It was silly.

2128
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,160
Yeah.

2129
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:18,660
Right.

2130
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:20,400
All right.

2131
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,160
Now that my brain is back on track,

2132
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,760
Loki, what do you have for us?

2133
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:25,220
Yes.

2134
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So it's kind of cool.

2135
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,560
We've got this story.

2136
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,280
We talked about this, I think a little bit ago where there

2137
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:38,640
was a DMCA takedown of Did You Know Gaming's video on the

2138
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:43,200
Heroes of Hyrule, which was a work in progress game that

2139
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,200
never made it to the DS.

2140
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,360
But it was supposed to be coming out on the Nintendo DS,

2141
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,120
kind of a tactics Zelda game.

2142
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,320
And it was taken down by, I think, Nintendo themselves.

2143
01:41:55,040 --> 01:42:02,080
But they have, I guess, worked with or fought against it

2144
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:08,720
with YouTube, and now it has been able to be put back up.

2145
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,040
They were able to win their case, I guess.

2146
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,360
So that's cool.

2147
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,240
And we get to actually see some information about this

2148
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:20,320
unpublished game that Nintendo, I guess, didn't want us

2149
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:20,820
knowing about.

2150
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,800
The only thing that irritates me about all of this is that

2151
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,840
thank you, Madeline.

2152
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,280
Sorry, off screen.

2153
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,040
Nice husband bringing me a drink.

2154
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,520
So the only thing that is disappointing about this is that

2155
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,880
Nintendo ought to get a strike.

2156
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,040
That's the way this should work.

2157
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:41,200
These companies claim things that there isn't their right

2158
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:41,840
to claim.

2159
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,040
They should get a strike.

2160
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,440
But that's not how YouTube is set up, unfortunately.

2161
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:46,660
Right.

2162
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,800
Basically, they did a DMCA takedown.

2163
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:51,760
He counter noticed.

2164
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,240
So if they said countered again, then they would get a

2165
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,840
strike on the channel, and they would have to go to court

2166
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,340
over this.

2167
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,000
But they never, I guess, responded.

2168
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,140
So.

2169
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,960
And Nintendo, you do not want that court case.

2170
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,320
I mean, I know Nintendo is a big, scary company, but this

2171
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:15,360
is the type of thing, this video, and maybe Nintendo could

2172
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,480
read the tea leaves on this.

2173
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,320
This is the type of thing that catches fire on Reddit.

2174
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,080
And some fucking lawyer goes, I'll do it pro bono to stick

2175
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,280
it in Nintendo on this.

2176
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,880
And this is the type of thing that just Nintendo doesn't

2177
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,360
want this.

2178
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,960
It was a mistake for them to do this in the first place.

2179
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,360
And maybe this is their way of quietly admitting that.

2180
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:39,520
But Nintendo is smart to not pursue this any further.

2181
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:40,960
Exactly.

2182
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,760
Because it's not like it was a project that they're working

2183
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,520
on right now, as far as we're aware.

2184
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,200
It's not something that they would be embarrassed by.

2185
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,760
It's just something that they never made.

2186
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,360
They decided not to go with it.

2187
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,080
Well, and there's so much precedent out there where it's

2188
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,680
like, we've seen documentaries about movies that were not

2189
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:04,240
made, lost TV pilots that were never meant to actually be

2190
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:07,840
on air that, you know, end up getting like the whole, like,

2191
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:11,040
documentary of things that didn't happen, especially after

2192
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,480
a certain statute of limitations.

2193
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,120
Like, again, it's not like this game was scheduled to come

2194
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:15,840
out this year.

2195
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,960
It was supposed to come out in the DS era, right?

2196
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,720
So like, like, damn near 20 years ago, at least 15 years

2197
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:27,520
ago. So it's like, it's not worth it to Nintendo to fight

2198
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,560
this. And, you know, then, of course, the internet is quick

2199
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,040
to label everything Streisand effect these days.

2200
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:37,280
But in part, yes, I guarantee you now more people have seen

2201
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,160
that documentary.

2202
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,400
Nintendo ultimately lost this.

2203
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:46,960
More people saw that documentary because gaming, journalism,

2204
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,440
social media all put that YouTube link this week in announcing

2205
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,000
that it's back.

2206
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,320
That's all these hits now.

2207
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,160
There it is.

2208
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,360
Tiger class says, remember Star Fox 2, a game that was never

2209
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,760
supposed to be released, but eventually did get released.

2210
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,520
Well, yes, that's a little different because Nintendo kind

2211
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,960
of put that out themselves.

2212
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,720
So it's not really like, but I mean, maybe I could read into

2213
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:15,920
that is that maybe Nintendo wanted to do a DS classic someday

2214
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,160
and put the canceled Zelda game in it.

2215
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,920
And maybe they're a little worried about that.

2216
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,760
I mean, that's the only thing where you might be able to

2217
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,920
go. Oh, that's why they did it.

2218
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,760
But again, I think they did more damage to their cause because

2219
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,920
now everybody's copy post pasting that link.

2220
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,680
But Tiger Clay, you do bring up an interesting parallel is

2221
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,800
that just because the game got canceled doesn't mean it's

2222
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,920
canceled forever.

2223
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,480
You know, and I could very much see a DS classic as something

2224
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,840
Nintendo does in the future is so weird to think that that's

2225
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,040
where we're at.

2226
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:56,240
But a little a cheap little DS handheld doesn't have to even

2227
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:56,800
be 3DS.

2228
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,440
A cheap little DS handheld with, like, 25 games preloaded

2229
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,960
onto it would be huge.

2230
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,680
And I bet Nintendo does.

2231
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,480
I there may be more.

2232
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,000
Yeah, VG realness.

2233
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,720
Hi, friend.

2234
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,880
In chat says, temper your expectations.

2235
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:13,680
It's Nintendo.

2236
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2237
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,520
Bring me down to Earth.

2238
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:19,040
But I feel like a DS classic could be a thing, but maybe

2239
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,960
not before we have a Game Boy classic.

2240
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:21,680
We still need it.

2241
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,680
Like, if they want to do something real fucking cheap,

2242
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,240
do it.

2243
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,440
Don't even backlight it.

2244
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:29,280
Do a classic 90s brick fucking Game Boy.

2245
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,720
Of course, the Tetris license might be a challenge to them.

2246
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,640
Do you think they dare put something like that out without

2247
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,320
Tetris? I don't know.

2248
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,240
Yes, maybe.

2249
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:39,440
Anyway.

2250
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,160
All right, let's move on.

2251
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,960
Let's talk about Konami.

2252
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:52,640
And Konami is teasing more stuff for the year 2023, not

2253
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,840
just their Silent Hill stuff, but new developments for

2254
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:56,720
familiar series.

2255
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,800
And I don't even think this means they're arcade stuff.

2256
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,760
So this is the year of the rabbit.

2257
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,840
So we are planning power ups and new developments for familiar

2258
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,280
series with the aiming of leaping even further.

2259
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,040
This is a quote from Famitsu.

2260
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,200
Additionally, we're deeply and quietly progressing on new

2261
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,240
projects that we have yet to announce to you all.

2262
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,160
Konami is leaping forward.

2263
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,800
What a strange tie in.

2264
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,560
So by all means, keep bringing Frogger up.

2265
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:33,840
Well, you probably because I was like, like, time pilot,

2266
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,040
like, leaping forward in time.

2267
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,960
No, it's probably fucking Frogger game.

2268
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:37,840
That's a Frogger game.

2269
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,520
Good job, Loki.

2270
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:41,120
You ruin everything.

2271
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:45,360
All right, you're probably right, though.

2272
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,640
Okay, so we're going to get to our next segment.

2273
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,160
Before I roll the segment, because Dark Sakura has already

2274
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,360
put this together for us.

2275
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,920
I do want to quickly mention about the 2020.

2276
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,200
I still need to talk over it.

2277
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,360
Oh, I thought this was.

2278
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,400
I told you my audio got lost last night.

2279
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,120
Oh, my bad.

2280
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:03,840
My bad.

2281
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,960
Well, then quickly, before we roll it, I want to talk about

2282
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:11,600
the 2023 twist, because we kind of threw out a few things.

2283
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,320
So of course, the classic game of the week is the segment

2284
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,480
we do every week here on Orange Zones Radio.

2285
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:22,560
But ever since what, like 2017, maybe 2016, I'd have to go

2286
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,520
check on the wiki.

2287
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,720
But you've been mixing it up for a while now is that one

2288
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,400
month out of the year, you will do a different category.

2289
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:34,560
Previous categories have included classic 8-bit soundtracks,

2290
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,880
classic pinball machines.

2291
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:42,320
And just last year we was that peripherals and consoles.

2292
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,560
Flag was a personal favorite of mine.

2293
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,840
But this last year we did classic electronic handhelds.

2294
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:52,240
This year, what is the new category officially?

2295
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:54,160
Because we've thrown a few ideas out there, but officially,

2296
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,760
what is our new category for 2023?

2297
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,560
Classic non-video game games.

2298
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:00,560
All right.

2299
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,440
And what defines a non-video game game?

2300
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,400
It's a game that isn't a video game.

2301
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:06,880
Perfect.

2302
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:07,200
All right.

2303
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,680
Quote it, print it, put it on the back of the box.

2304
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,800
That being said, let's get to the segment.

2305
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:28,640
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where

2306
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:32,240
I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell

2307
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,120
you about it.

2308
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:35,760
It's time for the classic game of the week.

2309
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:39,760
All right.

2310
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,280
And Dark Sakura, what did you...

2311
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,240
Whoa, sorry.

2312
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,040
Wrong screen.

2313
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:46,160
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game?

2314
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,440
Set on the screen, it's Mall Madness.

2315
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:54,640
Mall Madness, sometimes called Electronic Mall Madness,

2316
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,200
it is a shopping themed board game by Milton Bradley.

2317
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,680
The original was released in 1988 with a talking version

2318
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,280
in 1989.

2319
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,000
The game has been updated several times, a new design

2320
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,200
in 1996 and an update in 2004.

2321
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,120
The last one was in 2020.

2322
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:14,080
Oh, and there's other versions, including a Hannah Montana

2323
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,240
version and a Littlest Pet Shop.

2324
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:18,400
The Hannah Montana version actually has the distinction

2325
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,200
of being the first version that has a dude on the cover.

2326
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:26,480
So at any rate, the game was designed for players,

2327
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:31,760
four players, nine and up, mostly young teenage girls.

2328
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,080
And there were commercials targeting them and spending

2329
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,240
the money and running all over the place.

2330
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,440
You know, commercialism.

2331
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:45,600
At any rate, it had the following contents in the box.

2332
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,320
There was the box, the game board, the computer,

2333
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:51,280
the instruction manual, four rubber pads to prevent

2334
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:55,440
the pieces from slipping, six plastic wall pieces,

2335
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:59,120
four cardboard shopping lists, two sale items,

2336
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:03,200
one clearance sign, eight plastic ponds, two of each color,

2337
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:06,720
which are red, blue, yellow, green, and one being male,

2338
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:11,680
one being female, 40 plastic pegs to mark the shopping list,

2339
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,920
paper money that looks kind of like current, you know,

2340
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,800
American money, but color coded, four cardboard credit cards

2341
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:23,040
and 29 pieces of cardboard to hold the thing together.

2342
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,920
It's a three-dimensional field that looks like

2343
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,680
a shopping mall with two stories.

2344
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:33,920
There's some other places in there, but right in the center

2345
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,960
is your little bank slash credit card thing.

2346
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:44,240
So the voice, the computer thing dictates

2347
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:50,480
where you're playing and it uses like double A's to run.

2348
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,760
The computer parts are all made in the US.

2349
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,440
It's very keen on saying so.

2350
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,720
So the computer has two voices, one female, one male,

2351
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,720
and then there's two credit card slots on top.

2352
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,760
One is to buy items.

2353
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,920
The other one is for the banking.

2354
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,720
Now, except the 2004 version only uses a female voice.

2355
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,640
At any rate, you either pay with paper cash or you pay

2356
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:19,680
with the credit cards and you have four credit cards,

2357
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:23,040
one called Fast Cash from Good Sense Bank,

2358
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,920
Quick Draw from Dollar Days Bank,

2359
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,720
Mega Money from Big Bucks Bank,

2360
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,120
and Easy Money from Cash and Carry Bank.

2361
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:33,600
Now the stores are the best.

2362
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:34,720
The stores have the best names.

2363
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,720
I Am Coffin Drugstore, Suits Me Fine Men's Shop,

2364
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:44,000
Two Left Feet Shoes, Short Circuit Electronics,

2365
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,320
Yuppie Puppies Pets, Scratchy's Records.

2366
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,520
That one's pretty funny.

2367
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,360
Novel Idea Books, Frump's Fashion Boutique,

2368
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,560
The Right, W-R-I-T, Stuff Card Shop,

2369
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:58,400
Fork It Over Kitchen Store, Hocus Focus Cameras,

2370
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,920
Sweaty Sports, Made in the Shade Sunglasses,

2371
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:02,880
Chip's Computers.

2372
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:03,840
That one's clever.

2373
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,640
Ruby's Jewelry, Dingling Phones,

2374
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,520
M.T. Wallets Department Store,

2375
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,280
and Tinker's Toys.

2376
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,120
And then you have these four other areas.

2377
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,280
You have Coneheads Ice Cream Shop,

2378
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:18,160
The Restrooms, Vidiots Arcade,

2379
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,520
and my favorite name ever,

2380
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,880
Aunt Chovy's Pizza.

2381
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,800
What do you buy in the restrooms?

2382
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:25,360
You don't.

2383
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,560
You just donate.

2384
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,060
Oh.

2385
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,120
Body stuff.

2386
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,880
Hocus Focus is my favorite, by the way.

2387
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:32,180
Yeah.

2388
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,520
So basically the objective of the game

2389
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,120
is to be the first person to finish your shopping list,

2390
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,640
to get everything on the list,

2391
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,240
and then get back to the parking lot

2392
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,240
or whatever your last destination

2393
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:44,960
is supposed to be,

2394
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,560
depending on what version that you're playing.

2395
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:52,240
And to make it more challenging in the 80, 90, 96 versions,

2396
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:54,000
you could increase your goal to 10 items.

2397
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,920
So basically you're going around the shopping mall.

2398
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,880
There's some parts where it'll refuse your credit card

2399
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,960
or nothing will come out of the bank

2400
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:06,000
and there's all kinds of stuff going on.

2401
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,440
The first person, of course, to do all that wins.

2402
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:15,200
Um, I did not play this.

2403
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,040
This was not a part of my childhood.

2404
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,640
It was too expensive and a bad influence,

2405
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:26,320
which still doesn't explain why I'm a consumer whore today.

2406
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,440
But I mean, overall, it's pretty,

2407
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,840
I actually would love to get everyone together

2408
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,040
to play one of these,

2409
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,840
but I'd have to get this version, the 96 version.

2410
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,120
This may surprise you, but as the token gay

2411
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:45,120
who had many, you know, lady friends at a certain age,

2412
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,440
I never played this game either,

2413
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,920
but you know, I wanted to, you know,

2414
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,480
I know this may surprise you,

2415
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,920
but I have played this game.

2416
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,240
It was silly.

2417
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:01,200
Did Nelly make you?

2418
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,080
No, I played it with my sister.

2419
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:05,440
She had it.

2420
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,080
Okay. Okay.

2421
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,680
It does look like it could be fun.

2422
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:10,400
It is fun.

2423
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,160
Who doesn't like going to the mall?

2424
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:12,640
No, it's true.

2425
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:14,800
I mean, who doesn't like going to the mall?

2426
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,000
You know what's sad though?

2427
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,440
We're looking back at this as like, you know,

2428
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,280
the classic not video game of the week now,

2429
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,360
but then like in 10 more years, it's going to be,

2430
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:22,720
what's a mall?

2431
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,160
Anyway, there's more.

2432
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:30,660
Okay.

2433
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:31,920
Sorry.

2434
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,680
I needed chocolate to overcome this.

2435
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,720
At any rate,

2436
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:39,840
Milton Bradley did a line of digital electronic voice

2437
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,680
board games after this.

2438
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:46,720
In 1990, under their Parker Brothers brand,

2439
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,600
they did an updated version of a 1984 game

2440
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:52,960
called Mystery Mansion that had an electronic voice device.

2441
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,200
In 1992, they released a game called Omega Virus.

2442
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,520
I knew someone who had this.

2443
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,600
I've never played it and I really want to.

2444
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:06,160
So basically that game takes place on a space station

2445
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,840
that's infected by an extraterrestrial computer virus.

2446
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,280
And this one actually has a countdown timer

2447
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,800
that if you don't complete your objectives

2448
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,880
before the timer runs out, everyone dies.

2449
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,520
So it's got a lot more tension to it.

2450
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,280
But Michael Gray created Mall Madness.

2451
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:29,440
He also designed Omega Virus and one other electronic game

2452
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,040
you might find familiar.

2453
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,400
Dream Phone.

2454
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:35,200
And that's it.

2455
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,080
You didn't decide to combine the two

2456
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,080
and make Omega Mall Madness,

2457
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:41,840
because that sounds like that'd be amazing.

2458
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:44,480
There it is.

2459
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,320
Your classic not video game.

2460
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:49,600
And hey, I think the music isn't bad for me

2461
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:51,280
having thrown it together in five minutes.

2462
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,240
No, you did a great job.

2463
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:52,740
Thank you.

2464
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,500
All right.

2465
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,160
Good pick.

2466
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:56,660
Good pick.

2467
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,000
All right.

2468
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,640
And then one day it sounds like we'll have to all get together

2469
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,320
and play this game before we go see Megan.

2470
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:02,560
Okay.

2471
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,320
I'll have to go find a copy.

2472
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,040
Yeah, right.

2473
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,520
I was like, where do you even find old board games?

2474
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,480
I don't know.

2475
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,160
So are they all good?

2476
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:12,480
So somebody had joked when the segment started

2477
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,520
and we were defining it.

2478
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,120
Somebody said, Miltonious Games and Chat said,

2479
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:20,640
today's classic non-video game, Tag.

2480
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,360
Technically, Tag would qualify.

2481
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,600
So are we only going to get board games in this segment

2482
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,160
or are we going to get like playground games

2483
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:29,280
and other interesting things?

2484
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,560
Purchasable items.

2485
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:31,520
Okay.

2486
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,480
Purchasable items.

2487
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:32,720
Okay.

2488
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,200
I like that.

2489
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:33,840
Okay.

2490
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,720
So, you know, like not just board games,

2491
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:41,040
but like different sorts of games that you can play

2492
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,680
with people around you that you would have bought

2493
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:46,000
in a store that aren't fucking cards.

2494
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:46,500
All right.

2495
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,560
At least that aren't like playing cards.

2496
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:49,840
Well, and if you want to know more,

2497
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,680
hit that follow button, that subscribe button,

2498
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:54,320
that like button, the donate button, the email button,

2499
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,680
the tweet button, hit it all.

2500
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:56,800
All right.

2501
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,520
Let's move.

2502
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,600
Just hit a button and hope we see it.

2503
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:01,920
Okay.

2504
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:03,440
Moving on.

2505
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,920
Let's get to some rapid.

2506
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,040
Do you see what next month is?

2507
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:08,960
I can't wait.

2508
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,560
Microsoft has confirmed that there's going to be some games

2509
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:17,280
leaving Game Pass in the next, well, week or so here.

2510
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,880
So by January 15th.

2511
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,040
Anacrusis.

2512
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,400
We've got Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc

2513
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,760
Anniversary Edition.

2514
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:29,760
Nobody Saves the World, Paparazzi and Windjammers 2.

2515
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:32,320
Those are going to be leaving Game Pass.

2516
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:36,320
And apparently you get a 20% off of those games

2517
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,640
if you decide to purchase them to keep playing them

2518
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,520
like Paparazzi.

2519
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,000
Who doesn't like a Paparazzi game with puppies?

2520
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,480
And Roma all the way.

2521
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:44,980
Yep.

2522
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,720
Then, of course, this month we've got some free games

2523
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:54,160
with PlayStation Plus and Xbox games with gold.

2524
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:57,440
So on the PlayStation side, looks like Jedi Fallen Order,

2525
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,760
Fallout 76 and Axiom Verge 2.

2526
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,480
Those are going to be your free games for the month.

2527
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:11,840
And then on Xbox, we've got looks like Iris Fall,

2528
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:15,840
which is going to be from the 1st through the 31st.

2529
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,160
And then from the 16th through the 15th,

2530
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,440
you also get Autonauts.

2531
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,120
All right.

2532
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,240
Load up on those free games.

2533
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,440
I've been doing that with the Epic Store.

2534
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:30,560
That whole holiday, I only missed one.

2535
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,840
But you know what stinks?

2536
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,240
The one game I missed is the one I wanted to play

2537
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:35,840
most of all out of all they gave away.

2538
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:37,360
And that was them fighting herds.

2539
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,960
Was the one free game I didn't get during.

2540
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,400
Oh, yeah, I didn't get that either.

2541
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,160
And I didn't realize that they were doing that

2542
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,000
until well after it was started.

2543
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,320
I think I did get Death Stranding for free.

2544
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,120
Yeah, that was the big one.

2545
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,160
And then there's some other stuff,

2546
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,680
but I can't remember.

2547
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:52,180
Yeah.

2548
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:53,080
All right.

2549
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:54,420
Dark Sakura.

2550
01:59:55,860 --> 02:00:04,420
So Namco is bringing in Galaga to the Arcade Archives.

2551
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:10,180
So it, of course, we know it came out

2552
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:12,820
as the sequel to Galaxian in 1981.

2553
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:17,380
But it is one of their most iconic games

2554
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:19,940
and it will be a part of that.

2555
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:25,220
Available to download on PS4 and Switch at eight bucks.

2556
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:26,920
All right.

2557
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:29,460
Well, piggybacking on that a little bit

2558
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:31,860
and talking about the future of Arcade Archives.

2559
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:36,900
On January 26 in Japan is the New Zealand story.

2560
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:38,420
So that is probably one.

2561
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:38,900
Game!

2562
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:41,140
Yeah, I know it's one that's probably lesser known overall,

2563
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:43,060
but I know Dark Sakura has certainly picked that

2564
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,580
as a classic game at some point before.

2565
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:48,260
That is, of course, a sprite based platformer by Taito,

2566
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:50,900
which will be available on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

2567
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:54,260
It was originally in arcades in 1988.

2568
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:56,100
It was a love letter to New Zealand.

2569
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:59,300
It stars Tiki the Kiwi and you guide the bird

2570
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:00,740
through different mazes.

2571
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:05,940
You use balloons and dirigibles to rescue your animal friends

2572
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:07,380
that are in cages.

2573
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:13,700
So this was 1991 localized for the Nintendo Entertainment System,

2574
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:15,300
but they called it Kiwi Craze,

2575
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:17,940
but it is the same game if you ever saw that game.

2576
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:20,420
So also the soundtrack.

2577
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:22,100
A lot of people really dug for that game.

2578
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:23,060
And just so you know,

2579
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:25,140
that is pretty much in all the streaming services

2580
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:28,020
where you find music, Amazon, Spotify, YouTube, you name it.

2581
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:29,700
You can check that out as well.

2582
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:32,820
So that is available as well.

2583
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:34,980
By the way, speaking of Taito, since I brought them up,

2584
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:37,220
I also want to point out it's been announced

2585
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:41,140
that they're doing a 70th anniversary celebration in 2023.

2586
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:42,740
70 years of Taito.

2587
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:46,420
But that's not how long they've been making games,

2588
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:47,460
but pretty close.

2589
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:50,740
But of course, the company behind Space Invaders,

2590
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:52,180
Bubble Bobble and so forth,

2591
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:55,220
they've made a commemorative website and a Twitter account,

2592
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:59,940
but no word as to what the celebration is going to be just yet.

2593
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:01,940
Maybe some type of compilation, who knows?

2594
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:06,340
Of course, Taito originally founded in 1953 by Michael Kogan.

2595
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:10,260
It originally started as vending machines and jukeboxes

2596
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:13,380
and then went into electromechanical games in the 60s.

2597
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:17,060
And of course, then it all blew up with Space Invaders in 1978,

2598
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:22,100
which was in Japan was serious business.

2599
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:24,740
It was pretty big business here too,

2600
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:28,820
but probably I would say Pac-Man was the little more like,

2601
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:29,860
was the bigger game here.

2602
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:32,740
And then Space Invaders was like even bigger in Japan.

2603
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:36,820
So, all right, let's move on with some release dates.

2604
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:38,420
I'm not sure we have a lot this week,

2605
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:42,900
but sometimes companies are starting to put things out early in the year.

2606
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:44,980
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

2607
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:46,020
Loki, how about the US?

2608
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:47,620
We have a few things.

2609
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:52,100
We have Children of Silent Town on PC, Nintendo Switch,

2610
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:55,540
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

2611
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:59,940
Drago Noka on PC and Nintendo Switch.

2612
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:04,100
Lone Ruin on PC and Nintendo Switch.

2613
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:08,420
Vengeful Guardian Moonrider on PC, Nintendo Switch,

2614
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,660
PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

2615
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:15,940
Dragon Ball Z Cockroach on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

2616
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:21,540
One Piece Odyssey on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

2617
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:23,860
I'm sorry, that's actually, yeah,

2618
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:29,140
Xbox Series, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and PC.

2619
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:29,860
And that is it.

2620
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:32,660
By the way, just quickly in chat,

2621
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:34,660
before I get to the Japanese releases,

2622
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:36,260
Miltonius Games in chat said,

2623
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:39,860
now I want a Taito 70 made by Digital Eclipse

2624
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:43,460
kind of tying into the Atari 50 that came out.

2625
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:46,420
And you know, Taito really does have a pretty rich library.

2626
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:47,940
They've done compilations before.

2627
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:52,820
I had one on Xbox that was pretty good for that era of Taito games.

2628
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:56,420
And I know things like Rygar arcade version was on it.

2629
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,740
And of course, like Bubble Bobble, Paris All Stars,

2630
02:03:58,740 --> 02:03:59,460
and that whole thing.

2631
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:01,060
And then that made me go,

2632
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:04,740
ooh, that's a company that Arcade 1up needs to get with.

2633
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:05,540
Although to be fair,

2634
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:09,700
I think Taito had their own smaller reduced machines.

2635
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:11,300
They're probably not interested in getting in business

2636
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:12,420
with Arcade 1up just yet.

2637
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:13,860
Although I don't know to be determined,

2638
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:16,340
but I was like, if I can get a Bubble Bobble machine,

2639
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:18,020
that's, ooh, I think a lot of people would go

2640
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:19,780
for a Bubble Bobble machine, that's for sure.

2641
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:22,260
So, but anyway, back on track,

2642
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:24,660
let's talk about what's coming out in Japan this week.

2643
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:28,500
And the release date for these games on the Nintendo Switch

2644
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:30,420
would be January 13th.

2645
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:33,540
Really, it's just some new amiibo this week.

2646
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:36,100
A Sephiroth and a Kazuya figure

2647
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:38,020
will both be out released this week in Japan.

2648
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:40,340
That's really it for the Switch.

2649
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:42,580
Yeah, we don't have another release till the 19th.

2650
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:44,180
Looking at the PlayStation 5,

2651
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:45,220
okay, we have a couple of games there.

2652
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:47,700
We have One Piece Odyssey is released this week,

2653
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:49,060
speaking of Namco.

2654
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:51,380
They're also putting out Dragon Ball Z Kakarot

2655
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:52,980
is out this week in Japan as well.

2656
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:55,940
That's it for releases this week, so.

2657
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:58,340
Oh, sorry.

2658
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:00,020
YYR says, did you mean Rystan?

2659
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,460
Rygar was Tecmo, I think.

2660
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:03,300
Yeah, you are correct.

2661
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:07,460
I got my tease blurred, but there was a collection.

2662
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:12,180
Because I know I have, oh well.

2663
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:14,820
Old man brain kicking in,

2664
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:17,460
but there was some type of compilation I remember having.

2665
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:19,060
Rob, I'm older than you.

2666
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:19,940
Don't say those things.

2667
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,820
Well, I'm just saying.

2668
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:26,180
Anyway, is it my turn now?

2669
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:26,680
Yeah.

2670
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:27,560
Okay.

2671
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:31,640
So on the 10th for Xbox,

2672
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,640
we have the House of the Dead remake.

2673
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:40,760
On the 13th for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, One Piece Odyssey.

2674
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:45,720
And then also on PlayStation and Xbox the same day,

2675
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:48,200
Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.

2676
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:54,280
I've been watching the Japanese version,

2677
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:56,280
which is better.

2678
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,200
The voice actors are better.

2679
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,800
Rest in peace, Bulma's voice actor.

2680
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:02,920
All right, let's move on.

2681
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:04,280
We have a few more headlines for you,

2682
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:07,160
and then we'll try to take some calls if anybody wants to call in tonight.

2683
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:10,360
But I do want to make sure we're wrapped up by 9 Pacific tonight,

2684
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:12,280
just because with the storms coming in,

2685
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:15,400
I want to make sure Dark Soccer gets some DVD time in.

2686
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:19,400
And I also want time to take an edible and fall asleep.

2687
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:22,600
Take an edible and fall asleep before the storms come in, to be honest.

2688
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:23,100
All right.

2689
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:23,960
Do you need to share?

2690
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:27,000
Because I don't.

2691
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:32,040
What I'm talking about is a perfectly legal activity in California,

2692
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:33,480
so I'm not doing anything.

2693
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:37,240
But I only use them when I need to go to sleep.

2694
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:38,760
So all right.

2695
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,200
I use them for pain relief.

2696
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:42,680
No, seriously.

2697
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:43,320
No, I get it.

2698
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:44,120
I get it.

2699
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:50,280
I hear it's very popular for Lady Park cramps.

2700
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:51,560
Yes, it very much is.

2701
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:53,560
Oprah, was it Oprah that had a company?

2702
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:59,400
That made edibles for Shark Week.

2703
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:00,200
Interesting.

2704
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:00,760
Interesting.

2705
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:01,960
Yeah, very cool stuff.

2706
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:03,180
Moving on.

2707
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:05,560
I think we're to Loki.

2708
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:11,800
Yes, so the developer behind the PlayStation 2 emulator,

2709
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:18,440
Aether SX2, has decided to discontinue development of the app,

2710
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:23,400
because, of course, not Sony coming after them,

2711
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:25,960
but, you know, toxic fan community.

2712
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:31,960
Apparently, they're tired of never-ending online impersonations,

2713
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:33,960
complaints, demands, and death threats.

2714
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:35,880
Because that's what you do.

2715
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,640
Reach out to developers and threaten them with death

2716
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:42,360
if they don't develop something that's free.

2717
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:43,640
Okay.

2718
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:45,080
And they're just not going to do it at all.

2719
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:51,160
So, yeah, Aether SX2 is always meant to be a fun hobby for me,

2720
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:52,520
not profit-driven.

2721
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:55,160
It doesn't make sense to continue working on a hobby,

2722
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:56,280
which isn't fun anymore.

2723
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:00,200
Thanks to everyone who wasn't a dick for the last year.

2724
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:04,440
So that is annoying.

2725
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:05,560
But I hate people.

2726
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:07,160
Some people's children.

2727
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:09,880
It's one of those things where it's like,

2728
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:11,960
you know how we kind of always talk about,

2729
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,640
like, if OLR was going to get big,

2730
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:15,160
we would have gotten big years ago.

2731
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:20,200
And but it's kind of in some ways nice that we didn't get big.

2732
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,280
This is one of those reasons.

2733
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:25,400
We haven't had to put up with our share of bullshit

2734
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:26,120
over the years.

2735
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:27,720
But it's one of those things where it's like,

2736
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:32,440
some people's children do not know how to act.

2737
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:37,720
And it's just, it's just, it's so ridiculous.

2738
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:39,800
It's, it's just, it's sad.

2739
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,440
You know, and on one hand, it's like,

2740
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:43,800
don't give those people the time of day,

2741
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:46,200
but at the same time, easier said than done.

2742
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:49,400
Like, and that's the part of where social media,

2743
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:52,280
especially Twitter, has made it,

2744
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:54,920
and all my issues with Twitter aside for a minute,

2745
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:58,040
like that ability to direct message someone,

2746
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:01,240
basically, even if it's not direct direct messaging him,

2747
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:03,000
at them, and that there's a good chance

2748
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,440
they're going to read what you say,

2749
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:07,560
like, it's really gross.

2750
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:10,600
And that's why, if I do want to get on my soapbox for a minute,

2751
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:12,760
why I completely disagree with the direction

2752
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,680
that Twitter's new owner has been taking the company,

2753
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:17,320
because he wants to make it by the fact

2754
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:19,080
that anybody can buy a blue checkmark

2755
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:20,600
so that you can yell.

2756
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:22,920
Like that, that's how he wants to make money,

2757
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,960
is that you pay $8 a month and you can yell at celebrities

2758
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:27,480
and they have to read what you say.

2759
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:31,320
But it's kind of like, you do not understand how this works

2760
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:32,520
and how you're going to drive people,

2761
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:35,320
the main people from your platform that are lifting your platform up.

2762
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:36,600
Don't say if they mean to him,

2763
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:38,040
because they'll hurt his fee fees.

2764
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:39,960
Or track his plane.

2765
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:42,760
But anyway, soapbox stuff aside,

2766
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:44,840
it's one of those downsides.

2767
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:46,680
And of course, it goes without saying,

2768
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:48,440
I shouldn't have to say it to this audience.

2769
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:50,440
I really don't think I need to say it to this audience.

2770
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:51,880
I think the crowd that would do this

2771
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,560
doesn't listen to this program.

2772
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:55,720
Good, but don't do this.

2773
02:09:56,440 --> 02:10:00,360
But even, I think people listening to OLR

2774
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,040
are intelligent enough to not do this

2775
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:05,800
when it comes to talking to developers.

2776
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:09,640
But even consider the way you approach criticism sometimes.

2777
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:11,800
Constructive criticism, good.

2778
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:15,480
Fuck you, you fucking fuck, bad.

2779
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,080
Of course, depending on who it is,

2780
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:18,680
because some people need to be told.

2781
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:27,480
But for the most part, especially normal people,

2782
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:31,080
like people that are working on these emulators and so forth,

2783
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:32,680
just like you or me or whatever.

2784
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:34,760
Like, don't be this rude.

2785
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:35,720
It's not necessary.

2786
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:36,520
Call it normal.

2787
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:40,840
Yeah, and there's also a big difference between

2788
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:42,120
fuck you, you fucking fuck,

2789
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:46,520
and I'm going to insert the rest of your death right here,

2790
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:47,480
because I'm not going to say it,

2791
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:49,240
because somebody's going to quote it out of context.

2792
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:49,960
Disgusting.

2793
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:51,880
Yeah, there's a big, big difference

2794
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:53,080
between those two things also.

2795
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:56,040
Just don't say this stuff, even as a joke.

2796
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:56,760
It's not a joke.

2797
02:10:58,840 --> 02:10:59,560
It really isn't.

2798
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:04,600
I don't understand when people started thinking

2799
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,040
that saying this shit was okay.

2800
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:07,800
That's what I don't get.

2801
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,720
Phil of Nine in chat says,

2802
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:12,360
if people approach criticism with an ounce of kindness,

2803
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:14,440
it would be a better online environment.

2804
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:14,940
True.

2805
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:17,820
Maybe an ounce of maturity as well.

2806
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:19,020
You know, that's part of it.

2807
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:19,520
For sure.

2808
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:23,020
All right, let's move on.

2809
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:26,540
Dark Sakura, even more with Dead by Daylight,

2810
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:29,020
except this feels like a totally separate game sometimes.

2811
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:31,980
And it kind of is,

2812
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:35,580
but I know that people who've talked to me,

2813
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:38,300
you know, bring up Dead by Daylight Mobile in the past,

2814
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:42,220
and I couldn't play the old version,

2815
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:45,580
but I really was interested in playing the version

2816
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:48,380
that they got overseas, which is the NetEase version.

2817
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:52,380
It had different outfits and different Mori animation

2818
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:53,820
and all kinds of neat stuff.

2819
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:56,220
There was even like this golden Legion mask.

2820
02:11:56,220 --> 02:11:56,860
Oh, so cool.

2821
02:11:57,660 --> 02:12:01,660
So now though, we are getting the NetEase version.

2822
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:04,300
I am so excited about it.

2823
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:08,380
And the more pre-registers that they get

2824
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:13,260
is opening up new rewards.

2825
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:18,300
So I mean, they're up over 500,000 pre-registers,

2826
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:23,900
which actually now puts people into the Running to Win Wraith statue.

2827
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:28,140
They're already giving out all kinds of blood points

2828
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:32,620
and iridescent shards and all kinds of stuff in game.

2829
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:33,980
So I think that that's awesome.

2830
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:39,820
And they're also giving out other special items for pre-registrants,

2831
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:46,140
like some different cosmetics for Meg, Dwight, for Hillbilly, for Claudette.

2832
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:52,540
And there is a pre-registration ritual,

2833
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:55,980
where you can also get a certain Fang Min account,

2834
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:57,740
and that's if you've signed up for all the things,

2835
02:12:57,740 --> 02:12:59,900
which I was already signed up for most of the things.

2836
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:01,100
I only had to do one more thing.

2837
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:06,380
Um, although said outfit will also make you a target

2838
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:07,820
because it is very bright.

2839
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:12,300
But at any rate, I mean, the NetEase version of the game

2840
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:14,140
just has looked amazing.

2841
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:15,900
It had all kinds of extras in it.

2842
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:18,540
I mean, and playing on a mobile device

2843
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,860
is going to be a different experience.

2844
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:22,620
But I thought it was worth mentioning

2845
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:24,780
that we are finally getting the NetEase version.

2846
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:25,920
Huh.

2847
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:27,840
Cool.

2848
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:29,740
That's it.

2849
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:30,460
Off to check it out.

2850
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:36,060
Do if you if you do the registration stuff, you get bonuses.

2851
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:37,100
Well, I do like bonuses.

2852
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:38,320
All right.

2853
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:41,660
Uh, Loki, another story from you.

2854
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:45,500
And this is this is, uh, we will talk about these series of games very often.

2855
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:48,380
This is this is catastrophic for these fans, and it's a bummer.

2856
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:53,420
So, um, you know, the Madden Ultimate team is it's it's a thing.

2857
02:13:53,420 --> 02:13:57,340
People love their ultimate teams and their franchise modes and stuff like that.

2858
02:13:57,340 --> 02:14:02,940
Well, if you loved it enough to play it during December 28th or the 29th.

2859
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:04,220
Got some bad news for you.

2860
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:08,140
Your franchise save files are probably deleted or corrupted.

2861
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:13,260
So they had an issue where it corrupted their online database, corrupted,

2862
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:16,860
corrupting the franchise save files for many users,

2863
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:19,500
essentially deleting their custom leagues entirely.

2864
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:24,140
And they said, unfortunately, if you've logged into franchise leagues during this time,

2865
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:28,700
your data was affected due to a data storage issue that resulted in the franchise files

2866
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:29,420
being corrupted.

2867
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:35,180
We know this is important that your franchise or how important your franchises are to you.

2868
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:39,100
And we are actively working on a restore to fix some of the files via backup.

2869
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:43,500
Unfortunately, they're only they're estimating

2870
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:47,340
they're only going to be able to recover 40 percent of the users data.

2871
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:54,700
So a lot of those, it's permanently been wiped out.

2872
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:57,980
Well, it's going to make people distrustful of this whole cloud thing anyway,

2873
02:14:57,980 --> 02:15:01,020
which, as we all know, the cloud is just somebody else's computer on the Internet

2874
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:01,900
is what the cloud is.

2875
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:05,500
But it just it stinks when you can't like, how did they not have a backup

2876
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:07,740
thing in place like regular?

2877
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:10,060
It's just like, come on.

2878
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:12,460
And this isn't some small fry game either, you know?

2879
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:16,140
Yeah, it's very annoying.

2880
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:17,440
All right.

2881
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:23,500
Well, on a somber note, you know, this is the first show of 2023, and we're only eight

2882
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,700
days into 2023.

2883
02:15:24,700 --> 02:15:28,620
And already there's been, you know, a number of people that have touched the game industry

2884
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:31,100
in one way or another who have passed away.

2885
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:35,020
So just a moment to acknowledge some of these folks that passed away.

2886
02:15:35,020 --> 02:15:37,020
And there's probably plenty more than this, too.

2887
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:38,540
This is just the list in front of me right now.

2888
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:44,460
Earl Bone, who was the voice of Monkey Island's Captain LeChuck, passed away.

2889
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:48,460
I believe he was also one of those actors that was that guy.

2890
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:51,900
Because like when I saw the his picture, you know, I was like, Oh, that guy, you've seen

2891
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:53,980
him in plenty of movies and so forth.

2892
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:55,580
He was in things like Seinfeld.

2893
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:58,620
God, I'm trying to think like what movies he was in.

2894
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,380
But yeah, he's been in quite a few other things.

2895
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:04,780
He was in World of Warcraft doing some voices as well.

2896
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:05,820
And so on.

2897
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:06,860
He's he's done a lot.

2898
02:16:06,860 --> 02:16:08,300
So unfortunately, he passed away this week.

2899
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:16,620
Ken Block also passed away, who was involved with some Need for Speed titles, as well as

2900
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:17,980
the Dirt series.

2901
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:22,540
His cars, because he's a racing guy, also appeared in the Forza Motorsport series.

2902
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:25,660
So he has, you know, some connections to that as well.

2903
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:28,940
So again, that was Ken Block who passed away at the age of 55.

2904
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:30,060
That's far too young.

2905
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:33,100
Yeah, it was a snowmobile accident.

2906
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:36,620
And then you hear that Jeremy Renner was a very similar thing.

2907
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:39,180
He's still with us, but just scary, scary, scary.

2908
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:39,740
Be careful.

2909
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:40,240
Yeah.

2910
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:42,060
And then this is...

2911
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:43,500
Don't run your snowplow, y'all.

2912
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:45,820
Don't own a snowplow.

2913
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:47,820
Like, why do you have a full-size snowplow?

2914
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:48,700
Like, seriously.

2915
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:51,100
Also passing away.

2916
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:55,740
This was pointed out to us on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2917
02:16:55,740 --> 02:17:02,220
James Buster Corley, half of the Dave and Busters title there, co-founder of the Dave

2918
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:07,420
and Busters chain, passed away on January 2nd at his home at the age of 72.

2919
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:09,580
So that was...

2920
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:10,780
So young.

2921
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:12,000
Yeah.

2922
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:16,300
Unfortunately, it appears he passed away of a self-inflicted wound.

2923
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:24,700
So, but still his contributions to the gaming culture with Dave and Busters are pretty

2924
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:25,660
monumentous.

2925
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:27,580
So thank you, Tiger Claw Terminator.

2926
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:31,500
LeChuck Earl Bone was in the Terminator films as well.

2927
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:31,980
That's right.

2928
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:40,060
So anyway, that is it for the stories we had slotted for tonight.

2929
02:17:40,060 --> 02:17:43,980
I do want to take a moment to open it up, though, to any other questions, comments,

2930
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:45,820
and so forth, or any calls.

2931
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:51,100
You can join our green room over at our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2932
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:54,300
And I would encourage you to join the Discord and chat with us throughout the week as well.

2933
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:58,940
Tiger Claw points out the founder of Creative Labs also passed away.

2934
02:17:58,940 --> 02:17:59,340
That's right.

2935
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:00,300
I did see that.

2936
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:05,260
I neglected that that was in the past week, because I'm trying to make up for two weeks

2937
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:05,500
here.

2938
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:06,700
But yes, that's right.

2939
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:07,980
He had passed away as well.

2940
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:14,060
So we're just a few weeks into the year and not even just a week and a day into the year.

2941
02:18:14,060 --> 02:18:20,060
And it's, you know, I know sometimes it feels like, because I think there's even been comments

2942
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:23,820
on this in Discord, it feels like, my gosh, we're losing everybody this year.

2943
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:27,100
But, you know, it's what happens.

2944
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:28,700
Celebrities come, celebrities go.

2945
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:30,940
It's any take any year.

2946
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:32,540
Hey, guess what, people?

2947
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:32,940
What?

2948
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:33,820
People die.

2949
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:40,380
Yeah, it's all the time for many reasons, which just means treasure your own life and

2950
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:42,220
the people that are in it all the more.

2951
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:42,780
That's right.

2952
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:50,380
And there's nothing wrong with saying dead or die or being with people near you after

2953
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:51,180
they have died.

2954
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:53,500
It's respect for the dead.

2955
02:18:54,140 --> 02:19:01,660
I want to be on display at my house before I'm shot into orbit.

2956
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:04,300
Do you want something like what the Pope's getting?

2957
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:05,580
Where you're on full display?

2958
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:10,700
No, no, not like that, but no, no, no, not lay in state.

2959
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:16,140
But, like, I remember being a kid and people having, like, their memorials in their living

2960
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:16,380
room.

2961
02:19:18,220 --> 02:19:22,860
It might just be a Southern thing, but it was done well before the funeral industry

2962
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:26,060
took over and became a big financial conglomerate.

2963
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:26,860
No.

2964
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:31,020
When Jim passed away, they did something in someone's living room for that.

2965
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:31,820
Like, I remember.

2966
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,700
So it's not just a.

2967
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:35,900
Yeah, but we don't do that anymore.

2968
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:38,140
And I'm going on a tangent.

2969
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:38,940
I know I am.

2970
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:41,980
But it's been something that's on my mind, honestly, enough lately.

2971
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:45,100
I watched My Girl recently.

2972
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:51,660
Yeah, talk about crying and then things they get wrong in the funeral industry.

2973
02:19:53,340 --> 02:20:03,340
But, I mean, I think that instead of treating it like I mean, yeah, it can be tragic, especially

2974
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:04,860
when someone takes their own life.

2975
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:10,460
But I think that we need to just embrace it a little bit more, you know, and celebrate

2976
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:14,300
that they lived and that they did good things.

2977
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:17,420
Comments in chat.

2978
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:21,660
Phil of Nine in chat says, I'm sorry, wait, let me read this one first from Funara.

2979
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:25,020
It says, my sister wants her body thrown in the back of a truck and taken to the FBI's

2980
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:25,740
body farm.

2981
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:26,240
Haha.

2982
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:33,260
That was donated to science to study idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

2983
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:38,540
Phil of Nine in chat says, I watched Spoiler Alert tonight, speaking of sad movies about

2984
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:39,820
dying, but it was beautiful.

2985
02:20:40,540 --> 02:20:42,780
And that's not an actual spoiler because it's in the trailer.

2986
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:45,100
But you know what's funny?

2987
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:49,340
Because it makes me think of gay movies and, you know, to put things on a more lighthearted

2988
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:55,740
note, I do think it is really funny going back to Megan, how Megan has made more money

2989
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:57,900
at the box office because Megan did very well.

2990
02:20:57,900 --> 02:21:03,500
It didn't make Avatar money, but it made it like made back its budget and then some already.

2991
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:08,060
So the funny thing about Megan is it's doing well enough where like it did better than

2992
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:08,940
bros did.

2993
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:15,020
If it tells you how the gay community is responding to who our real queen is.

2994
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:17,980
So it's official.

2995
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:23,420
Megan has dethroned Billy Eichner as the face of gay cinema.

2996
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:23,920
There it is.

2997
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:26,480
All right.

2998
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:29,420
There's no calls.

2999
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:30,300
That's fine.

3000
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,100
We don't I don't know.

3001
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:33,020
I didn't check on emails, but I don't remember seeing any.

3002
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:33,500
I'm sorry.

3003
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:34,060
I should.

3004
02:21:34,060 --> 02:21:34,540
I did.

3005
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:35,980
I didn't check on them either.

3006
02:21:35,980 --> 02:21:37,660
I'm a bad email person.

3007
02:21:37,660 --> 02:21:38,540
I can look real quick.

3008
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:39,040
Sorry.

3009
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:40,700
Participate at orange.com.

3010
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:41,340
I'm not sorry.

3011
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:42,060
I mean, I'm kidding.

3012
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:43,520
Okay.

3013
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:46,300
You know what?

3014
02:21:46,300 --> 02:21:48,700
There's nothing but spam.

3015
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:50,860
Yeah, we've been getting targeted with that again lately.

3016
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:52,780
Um, I fucking hate it.

3017
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:54,860
DJ Rama S in chat says at Rob Roberts.

3018
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:55,900
So is that a good thing?

3019
02:21:55,900 --> 02:22:01,020
Asking about the bros and Megan thing and Tiger Claw says, yeah, at least bros doesn't

3020
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:04,220
talk down to the audience who didn't watch it because the movie was bad.

3021
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:05,980
I heard the movie was all right.

3022
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:10,060
Like the Alan actually watched some of it on a plane, but then he realized he was watching

3023
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:13,100
it on a plane with some of the content in it and turned it off.

3024
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:18,620
Um, but he said it was funny and a lot of people say it was humorous, but I'm kind of

3025
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:21,740
with what you were saying there is like, I don't appreciate that.

3026
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:25,660
Like I'm an asshole or I'm letting down the community or something by not seeing your

3027
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:26,460
stupid movie.

3028
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:31,020
Cause there's lots of gay cinema out there that doesn't get the type of attention that

3029
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:31,900
that movie got.

3030
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:35,260
And it's like extraordinarily frustrating that somebody would use their platform to

3031
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,820
call people that don't go to their, see their movie homophobes.

3032
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:43,420
Like, I just think that was, that was such a piss poor move on Billy Eichner who does

3033
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:49,420
some funny things sometimes, but does some really not funny things other times.

3034
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:51,740
And that is an example, one of the things that's not funny.

3035
02:22:51,740 --> 02:22:53,580
The category of shitty.

3036
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:53,900
Yeah.

3037
02:22:53,900 --> 02:22:56,940
It's just, it's inappropriate.

3038
02:22:56,940 --> 02:23:05,260
So as far as I'm concerned, Megan kicking his butt is swift justice the way Megan would

3039
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:05,820
deliver it.

3040
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:11,100
I like a strong kick in the, the pant region.

3041
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:13,340
All right.

3042
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:14,060
Well, that's it.

3043
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:15,820
There's no calls awaiting.

3044
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:19,260
I guess I should see if there's any last minute stories just as a formality, but I'm guessing

3045
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:20,220
this week, probably not.

3046
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:22,140
Not really.

3047
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:27,820
I was trying to remember what the name of this thing was, but there's a new like virtual

3048
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:30,700
console system, like the Pico 8 that just got released.

3049
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:33,820
That's like almost like a super Pico 8, but not.

3050
02:23:34,380 --> 02:23:37,260
I'm just trying to remember, trying to remember what it was called.

3051
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:38,780
Yeah.

3052
02:23:38,780 --> 02:23:41,260
It's like, it's like a fake console, like the Pico 8.

3053
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:41,500
Yeah.

3054
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:43,020
Like the old Sega one, right?

3055
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:45,340
It is sort of.

3056
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:48,300
So it's, it's basically, it's a fake console format.

3057
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:51,580
That's a virtual machine that you can develop games for.

3058
02:23:51,580 --> 02:23:55,420
It's like, they have, you can buy it and then like, you can develop for it for free.

3059
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:57,100
It doesn't really exist.

3060
02:23:57,100 --> 02:24:04,060
It's just like, it's like arbitrary format that they made up that exists in the digital

3061
02:24:04,060 --> 02:24:04,700
space.

3062
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:07,100
Although it would be cool if there was a physical Pico 8 console.

3063
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:11,820
But I was hearing Pico, like the Sega system.

3064
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:13,020
So that was Mima's hearing.

3065
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:14,540
Pico, P-I-C-O.

3066
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:15,900
Pico 8 is what it's called.

3067
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:18,300
As in De-guy-o.

3068
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:20,300
Yes.

3069
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:25,580
Like, I don't remember though what the new one was.

3070
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:30,220
I saw a video on it earlier this week, but yeah, I can't remember what the new fantasy

3071
02:24:30,220 --> 02:24:31,260
console was.

3072
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:31,900
Oh, that's what it is.

3073
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:34,940
Or the Boulevard that the LA Convention Center is on.

3074
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:42,540
And it leads to the, the best of all the Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles.

3075
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:46,780
Yeah.

3076
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:49,260
So I don't know.

3077
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:50,460
I'll have to find it.

3078
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:50,960
All right.

3079
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:53,820
Oh, Philonines says, I used to live near Pico.

3080
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:55,500
I guess it's one of those, like, just huge.

3081
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:57,740
I think it's probably like a very, very, very long street.

3082
02:24:57,740 --> 02:25:01,260
Because I remember going down there when I used to travel down there a lot for work.

3083
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:06,780
There was Victory in Van Nuys, and those were like the streets that went through the entire

3084
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:09,420
fucking valley, like north side of LA.

3085
02:25:10,380 --> 02:25:13,660
So it's like, you talk about Victory in Van Nuys, you could be talking about like seven

3086
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:18,460
different cities from Burbank all the way to whatever's on the end of that, Woodland

3087
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:20,380
Hills or even further, probably even further.

3088
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:22,300
So, all right.

3089
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:24,780
Well, that's about it.

3090
02:25:24,780 --> 02:25:26,940
We're going to wrap up tonight.

3091
02:25:28,140 --> 02:25:30,300
That is it for another episode of Orange on its Radio.

3092
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:31,820
Good way to start 2023.

3093
02:25:31,820 --> 02:25:33,660
Thank you all so much for being here.

3094
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:35,260
Appreciate you being here.

3095
02:25:35,260 --> 02:25:38,300
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange on its Radio tonight, please tell a friend

3096
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:39,100
or two about the show.

3097
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:42,300
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

3098
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:44,220
need more voices to put out on air.

3099
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:45,020
Hello.

3100
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:48,380
So tell a friend a five star review.

3101
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:48,940
I found it.

3102
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,380
It's the Picotron.

3103
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:51,420
That's what it's called.

3104
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:52,620
Picotron.

3105
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:52,860
Okay.

3106
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:54,300
Oh, it's just this thing.

3107
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:54,620
All right.

3108
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:59,980
Tell a friend a five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found

3109
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:01,260
this show goes an awful long way.

3110
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:02,300
So thank you for those as well.

3111
02:26:02,300 --> 02:26:06,620
A follow for VOG Network on Twitch, whether you're here live or not, super appreciated.

3112
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:11,340
And of course, join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

3113
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:13,420
Once again, best of luck to our pal Bobby Black Wolf.

3114
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:13,900
Go to bed.

3115
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:15,500
You've got some announcing to do in a few hours.

3116
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:19,500
And that's about it.

3117
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:23,740
Before I get the final, final thoughts, let me start with Dark Sakura with her final thought,

3118
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:27,660
because I know you're off to do some Dead by Daylighting.

3119
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:32,380
Still in my heart of hearts, a filthy pig mane.

3120
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:34,060
All right.

3121
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:34,700
Have a good stream.

3122
02:26:37,980 --> 02:26:39,660
And Loki, your final thought for tonight?

3123
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:43,340
I'm hopefully going to be making more content this week.

3124
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:44,700
I've got a lot of videos to put out.

3125
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:45,900
Always.

3126
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:52,620
My final thought is one game I forgot I played this week was No Man's Sky, because I attempted

3127
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:56,620
to do the redo of Expedition 7 on stream.

3128
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:02,060
I got so frustrated yet again with climbing those fucking mountains just to get attacked

3129
02:27:02,060 --> 02:27:06,620
by alien things like that was just a poor expedition and I didn't finish it.

3130
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:11,580
So my streak of completing every No Man's Sky expedition has been broken.

3131
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:16,700
But to be honest, if I'm going to break it on any expedition, number seven fucking earned

3132
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:17,260
it.

3133
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:18,780
So that's it.

3134
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:19,980
That's it for my final thought.

3135
02:27:19,980 --> 02:27:23,580
We'll see you all here next time in seven days when we do it all again.

3136
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:25,260
I hope you all have a wonderful week.

3137
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:26,380
We will see you next time.

3138
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:27,420
And guess what?

3139
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:31,100
The holidays live on with our ending tonight because I forgot to flip it out tonight.

3140
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:32,460
So what about it one more time?

3141
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:34,620
We're still within are we within 12 days of Christmas?

3142
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:36,300
No, I guess we're back.

3143
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:36,860
Well, you know what?

3144
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:37,900
It's 16 bits now.

3145
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:39,180
16 days of Christmas.

3146
02:27:39,180 --> 02:27:40,300
Have a good night, everyone.

3147
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:40,940
See you next time.

3148
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:44,700
