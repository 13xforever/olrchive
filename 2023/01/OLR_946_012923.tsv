30000	37280	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki to tell you about the very welcoming week of gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	67040	Rob Roberts is joined every Sunday night as we broadcast with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
67680	69800	Hello. Hello. How are you, my friend?
70680	71360	Alright.
71560	74160	Yeah. Just just okay. Just alright.
74200	75280	I have a little bit of a headache.
75320	75960	Oh, I'm sorry.
75960	81160	I mean, it's it's the I'm going back to work on Wednesday.
81200	81840	Yeah.
82120	85480	And I don't know how I how I feel.
85760	88200	Yeah. Well, yeah, it's understandable.
88280	91080	I bet your co-workers miss you, though, except are you going back in person?
91080	92600	I can't remember if you go to the office.
92600	93280	Two days a week.
93320	95120	Okay. Okay. So some some. Okay.
95400	95880	Yeah.
96160	96640	Gotcha.
96640	98200	Out of, you know, my four days.
98200	103360	And I know that like the first two days I get there are going to be, hey, do all your training.
103360	105120	Hey, look how much email you have.
105160	105720	Oh, guess what?
105720	108440	You have to upgrade your OS on two computers.
108640	111040	That's the worst part about taking any time off.
111040	115120	You can take a day off and it's like the email mountain you come back to is always absurd.
115520	119920	And thankfully, like 90 percent of it is stuff that I can delete.
121280	122160	It's just.
123480	128840	I set up mail rules and they don't always work, and I'll leave it at that.
128880	130600	Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha.
130600	134520	All right. Let's also say hello, of course, to the one and only tech master, Loki.
135440	138040	Oh, hi, Loki. How are you?
138040	140040	All right. Catch in the cold, but I'm all right.
140040	141960	Oh, no, I hope it's only a cold.
142720	144040	Let it go. You shouldn't catch it.
144920	146720	Yeah, let it go. Let it run free.
147640	149960	What is that that's playing behind you tonight?
149960	154080	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice
154080	156840	geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
157040	160560	And as we tape live, you can see video of us doing this show.
160560	163680	But of course, everything is always in the audio form for you.
163680	168880	Find folks that listen through a podcast app such as Spotify, iTunes, whatever.
168880	170280	Amazon Music, I think, does them now.
170320	171960	Wherever you listen to podcasts, we're there.
172640	177880	And but if you are watching live, you get to see some video, including whatever this is that Matt is
177880	180160	playing that I can't tell what this is.
180160	183000	It looks like a scary game of some sort because I think it's not.
183160	184960	Oh, it looks like something scary is about to happen there.
185240	187360	No, no, it's it's Bone Lab.
187360	191560	It's it's a VR game by stress level zero.
191960	193200	It's their sequel.
193200	197400	It's a pretty cutting edge VR game that I need to play.
197400	203200	I have it and I have my VR in a box, like
204480	207480	Oculus, Rift S in a box and stuff.
207480	210600	So I know I don't think it's too scary.
210760	212160	There's skeletons, I guess.
212160	217160	OK, well, as I said, a little scene that was played behind you look kind of freaky, but a little trickery for some crowds.
217160	220400	Yeah, well, it's it's just I don't know.
220400	223520	I think you go through I don't remember the exact premise of the game.
223520	225760	I think you go through like different modules or whatever.
225760	228000	There are different time periods.
228000	229800	Oh, like quantum leap.
229800	233080	Sort of like it looks like you're kind of like being treated like a witch here
233080	235680	and then you fall into a dungeon, you fight, you know.
236800	240240	Skeletons, and then there's another one, you fight like robots and stuff.
240320	242720	Can I ask a completely fucking random question?
242720	244520	This is Orange Lounge Radio, right?
244520	246480	And we don't have a lot.
246480	248680	The news this week was a little bit shorter.
248680	250760	We can get on a tangent once in a while, right?
250760	253040	Especially if it has to do with a video game or in this case.
253280	255360	Why isn't there this video game?
255360	258960	And my question is, why don't we have a quantum leap video game?
259120	260760	How has that never happened over the years?
260760	263680	I'm talking either because they just relaunched it, right?
263680	265080	There's a newer version, right?
265080	267040	It doesn't have the same actors.
267040	268360	Well, one of them passed away.
268360	273040	But it's it's from what I understand is a completely passable version of the show.
273040	275240	It's not terrible, like a lot of reboots.
275240	277440	Sounds like NBC is actually kind of getting the reboot thing
277440	279480	because I hear the Night Court one is pretty good, too.
279480	282200	But I understand why Night Court's not a video game.
282200	284520	I don't understand why Quantum Leap isn't a video game.
284520	286760	Or am I missing something from the 80s or 90s?
286760	288640	Was there an obscure game I just didn't know about?
288760	292400	Because I know a lot of TV like Star Trek Next Generation had a Super Nintendo game.
292880	294520	There was a lot of stuff that had video game.
294520	296640	I don't remember Quantum Leap ever having a video game.
297320	302320	No, I don't think it did, but I don't know what that would be.
302840	304360	Well, like you're like you're talking about.
304360	308640	You're hopping into different bodies and solving different adventures like the show.
308880	313000	Maybe they could actually do an ending that fucking doesn't just end
313000	315560	like the original show did, you know?
317360	319640	Looking in chat, Darticia says,
319640	322440	Alright, also, I hear the sequel got another season.
322440	323240	Yeah, I heard that, too.
323240	325720	That's kind of one reason I bring it up is that, you know,
325720	329720	a lot of those revivals of old shows, some of well, I shouldn't say a lot of them.
329720	331920	Some of actually quite a few of them have done very well.
331920	334840	The Roseanne without Roseanne is like still going.
335160	340280	There's the Will and Grace was on for several seasons there.
340440	342480	There's a lot of shows that come back and they do pretty well.
342760	346520	But yeah, Fifth Dream says too much plot, not enough action.
346520	348760	Maybe Questbuster with the suggestion
349080	352320	a scum like adventure based on Quantum Leap would be neat.
352320	355920	Now you're talking now you're talking like a more text based, not text based,
355920	362080	but, you know, old school 90s PC, King's Quest, LucasArts, RPG in Quantum Leap.
362080	364160	Hell yeah. Now now we're talking.
364160	368880	Let fucking not telltale games, but I guess they are telltale games again.
368880	370120	But the people that are making games
370120	373120	like the old telltale games, let them do a Quantum Leap game.
373160	376080	Hell yeah. I'd rather see that than Jurassic Park.
376880	378600	Anyway, I don't know.
378600	382360	I'll take I'll take a scum based Seinfeld game
382640	386320	because I already know that someone's made that concept and it looked hilarious.
387040	391840	Bobby Black Wolf with the realistic answer saying licensing, which, yeah,
391840	397000	but, you know, NBC, NBC, Comcast, Universal should license more of their stuff.
397120	398800	Isn't Jurassic Park or Universal?
398800	401480	I guess it's based on a book, though, so maybe that one end up a little different.
401720	405840	But hell, if you if you were to open that up, you could have a saved
405840	409040	by the Bell video game you could have.
409800	411800	You can have all sorts of things.
411800	414760	Anyway, I mean, they made a high school musical game, so why not?
415120	417600	Why not? Exactly. That's exactly my point.
417600	420480	If these crappy things can have video games, why can't Quantum Leap?
421160	424840	Tigerclaw points out there was an article on Eurogamer in 2021
424840	428320	that says someone should make a game about Quantum Leap.
428320	432680	Well, somebody and I over on that website are on the same wavelength then.
434880	439720	All right. Let's talk about the games we know are coming out or in some cases
440240	444080	did come out. Let's talk a little bit about that Microsoft developer direct
444080	448160	that's kind of taken over the headlines this week as our first topic for tonight.
449120	450960	Loki, do you want to talk about this? Did you watch it?
450960	453880	I must admit, I was able to watch it.
454600	456440	Just a quick aside.
456440	460600	My dad had surgery this week, and although it went well,
461160	464720	there was a complication that caused us to go to the ER that same night.
464760	468680	He's fine. Everything is is but it's just it was a bumpy road to get there.
468960	472680	So my point is I was a little removed from some of this this week
472920	474840	and I didn't watch this live.
474840	476920	I didn't really do catching up on gaming news
476920	478760	until the weekend with other stuff going on.
478760	480520	I'm sure you all can understand no one's going to fault me.
480520	483720	But just to put that in perspective, so I didn't watch this live.
483720	485560	I just kind of caught up on the cliff notes.
485560	489800	I'm I'm not sure if I'm assuming Jamie doesn't usually watch
489800	492400	the Microsoft stuff live, but Loki, I don't know if you did.
493640	494600	I didn't watch it live.
494600	497400	I knew it was coming and I forgot what time it was on.
497840	500360	I watched it after part of it after the fact.
501000	502040	Only the beginning of it.
502040	504200	So they showed off.
504200	506120	Was it a new trailer?
506160	507560	It was kind of boring.
507560	509120	It was really boring.
509120	512440	At least this trailer was for Minecraft Legends showing off
512440	517280	the the PvP 4v4 mode that they have, which.
519400	522040	May. OK, cool.
524040	525800	So there's that.
525800	530120	And then they announced the date that's coming out, which is April 18th.
530640	532560	So it'll be part of Game Pass.
532560	534680	That's probably going to be the way I'll check it out.
535080	537320	I'm not buying that it.
538320	540880	Like I said, this has the Fallout 76
542200	544320	feel to me, the more you wait.
544320	546840	No, actually, it wasn't Fallout 76 Elder Scrolls Online.
546840	551240	It was the more I saw of that game, the less I wanted to play it.
551240	553840	And the same with Minecraft Legends.
553840	556360	The more I see of this, the less I want to play it.
556720	558840	It just doesn't look interesting.
560160	562920	They had a little bit of a kind of
563880	566280	preview of Forza Motorsports,
566880	569400	which is, I guess, you know, kind of
570360	573800	not incrementing the numbers anymore, kind of rebooting, I guess, if you will.
574880	576520	And looks cool.
576520	580120	They've, you know, really stepping up like the different physics
580120	584600	as far as like paint and even just the, you know,
584600	588600	car physics themselves and the damage models, dirt accumulation,
588840	592240	like, you know, all that like intricate stuff that's just like
592320	593680	way too detailed.
593680	596320	But, you know, at this point, like the cars look like cars.
596520	599600	You got to get to that in unnecessary detail.
600400	602160	IRL stuff we take for granted.
602160	606400	I know. Why is like realistic dirt so funny to me?
606400	608000	I don't know why.
608000	610600	If I want to see like blood, you know,
611480	614960	bug splat physics and stuff like that, that's what they need to do in there.
615320	618080	You know what would be funnier is like, I would love to see something like this,
618080	622880	but like from like, say, a Cruzan USA game, you know, like,
622880	627600	you know, just a ridiculous thing because Cruzan is just absolutely unrealistic.
627760	630720	But they could talk about the physics of like the deer exploding
630720	632320	when you hit it and stuff like that.
632320	634240	We've made the Gibbs that much more
635560	636800	so much more fidelity.
636800	638160	He's some spy. What was that?
638160	639680	What was that super realistic?
639680	641400	Carmageddon, was that what it was called?
641400	644840	The one that ended up on a congressman watch list and things like that.
644880	645600	That's what you want.
645640	648360	You want Carmageddon or something like that, don't you want a Carmageddon?
648360	651520	But it's like, I think it would be funny to have like one of these games
651520	655800	that's just like absolutely the total opposite side of the spectrum,
656080	659120	like putting out a video like this, talking about the details.
659440	661840	It's just like it'd be funny.
661840	663000	But yeah, it looks really cool.
663000	665440	Sick, very sick.
666560	669560	They said it was at 20 tracks, 50 cars,
669560	673000	800 different upgrades to those cars, something that.
673840	677720	And then they showed off a brand new kind of a surprise game
677720	682840	called Hi-Fi Rush, which was a rhythm focus character action game,
682840	686720	kind of looked reminded me a little bit of Sunset Overdrive.
687320	692480	And that was a thing that actually I believe came out that day.
692480	693880	It sure did.
693880	696280	So that that looked pretty cool.
696280	698680	They talked a little bit about actually, can we go back to Hi-Fi Rush
698680	700960	for a minute, because I actually played it a little bit.
700960	702920	So it's it's pretty cool.
703200	706440	It reminds me a little bit of like, I know a lot of people were
706440	710040	comparing it to Jet Set Radio Future because of the art style
710040	711480	and the fact that it's a music game.
712160	714440	But the way it plays is not like that at all.
714440	718240	I would call it Beatenetta because it's like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry,
718240	720800	but with rewards for beat matching,
720800	724000	which also is not particularly unique to a game.
724000	728280	I want to say it's very I want to say this game was probably when they
728280	730360	when they came up with coming up with this game or whatever.
730560	733280	They were probably like, what if we did Crypt of the Necro Dancer?
733480	735480	But we did it like Devil May Cry.
735480	737640	And that's where this game came from, pretty much.
737920	742000	But it's it's I mean, especially for a surprise release with no buildup.
742360	745600	I love the art style in it is so, so good.
746360	748560	And it actually it has a really good sense of humor.
748560	751360	Like the voice acting in the game is really good.
751360	754840	And it's got like a really like cute, funny plot to it.
754840	757680	So, yeah, I'm I'm like super into this game.
757680	760400	And it was it's for a stealth release.
760800	761480	It's great.
762360	765160	So it's definitely worth a look if you're like on Game Pass or whatever.
765160	767760	And I'm glad because I know a lot of people kind of been talking about
767760	773160	how like Game Pass is like not had stuff to look forward to
773160	775480	or whatever for the past few months, you know,
775480	777480	because they've been removing my Steam wish list.
777480	778920	Yeah, but this this game is great.
778920	780640	I think I think you might like this Dark Sakura.
780640	781440	I think you would.
781440	784640	Well, no, it's like I said, it's been on my Steam wish list for a while.
785200	786200	What? This game?
786200	787200	It just came out this week.
787200	788720	No, it just came out this week with no fanfare.
788720	792640	No, there was a Steam thing on there.
792640	795160	Hold on. Maybe I'm thinking of a different one with similar graphics.
795160	798880	It did come out on Steam, but there was no fanfare for this.
798880	801280	They literally announced it on Wednesday or whatever.
801280	802560	And they were like, it's out today.
802560	806000	This game has been on my Steam wish list, not Xbox.
806000	807000	Nothing having to do with it.
807000	809560	Just that I think it looks like a good game and it's on my wish list.
809560	811880	Oh, yeah. No, that's what I was saying.
811880	813840	Gotcha. I thought you said it had been on it.
813840	816320	Like I was like, wait, but it's only been out. I got it.
817600	821280	But yeah, I mean, the game is a lot of fun.
821280	824800	And the licensed music, like it has like Nine Inch Nails,
824800	827040	Perfect Drug, which is really cool. Love that song.
827040	829080	You know, it's just lots of neat stuff in it.
829080	830560	And I thought it was very smart.
830560	835000	They did a streamer friendly mode for the game to encourage people to stream it.
835560	839640	Everybody knows because this game is a like shadow drop release,
839640	841360	basically unannounced comes out of nowhere.
841360	845360	In fact, I noticed that the icon on my desktop to launch
845360	848400	the game is still called Hibiki, which is not the name of the game.
848400	849600	It's called Hi-Fi Rush.
849600	852560	So I think this game was such a shadow drop with little fanfare.
852560	856880	They accidentally left the project name or the code name in the files.
856880	857880	I'm wrong. I'm wrong.
857880	859520	It was a different game on my wish list.
859520	860640	OK, OK.
860640	863920	Bomb Rush Cyber Funk, which is like a Jet Set Radio clone.
864040	866240	Oh, interesting. Yeah. Hmm.
866800	868880	But but yeah.
868880	873600	So Hi-Fi Rush, I absolutely would say, I mean, if you have Game Pass,
873600	877280	this was a great little thing to sweeten the pot with this this week, that's for sure.
878880	881520	Let's see. And oh, Mike Deft thought of it in chat, too.
881520	883720	I was just looking at the chat here, catching up a little bit.
883720	886560	Dr. T in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says,
886720	888800	I was loving Hi-Fi Rush for the most part.
888960	891560	Then I hit a wall on one of the rhythm based sections.
892120	894160	I wonder, I actually don't know the answer to this.
894160	896200	Can you tone down the difficulty in the middle of it?
896720	897960	Because I'm playing on normal,
897960	900720	but I'm willing to drop it down to easy if I need to clear a section.
900720	902600	So I'm not I'm not sure.
902600	904160	Maybe so.
904160	906680	And SSG100 Matt does point out the ever important.
906960	908240	You get to pet the cat.
908240	910400	Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
910400	915160	Anyway, sorry, but I just I since I did play it a little bit and I think this game.
916160	918960	Here's the thing. Sorry, I don't mean to harp too much on this, but I think it's important.
920200	924600	Another game with a lot of fanfare came out this week, and that's Square Enix's
924600	925720	Fourspoken, right?
925720	928840	They've been really putting a lot of money into promoting that.
929000	931000	And they had the demo that came out.
931000	933360	And it's been landing to mixed reviews.
933360	935520	Now, I I don't have a horse in this race.
935520	936640	I don't have a PS5.
936640	939000	I can't even play it if I wanted to.
939000	940320	I haven't played it myself.
940320	945200	I don't know if it you know, I saw that clip float around the Internet
945200	948120	of the scene of the voice acting that people were criticizing.
948120	950800	And I did not think it was as bad as people were making it out to be.
950800	954240	And I think I think there's a tell in there, but I digress.
954240	955800	If the game is bad, the game is bad.
955800	958480	That's, you know, the what it is at the end of the day.
959320	964960	But I just that is a, they've been hyping it for months and months and
964960	969360	months, $70, you know, preorder it, get it out there game.
969680	976080	And then this shows up pretty much the same day, $30 or game pass or, you
976080	977200	know, whatever.
977720	981520	And you can grab it and now and now everybody's streaming this one.
981800	986160	Whereas the other one, Square Enix is paying people to stream it.
986800	988000	I don't think that's happening here.
988800	993040	So it's it's a very interesting yin and yang happening this week.
993040	994880	And again, I'm not trying to dog on the other game.
995040	998160	I'm just saying hey, from my perspective sitting here, this is
998160	1001960	really interesting how this one is really dominating the conversation
1001960	1004760	because it was a shadow release that you know, even if you don't have
1004760	1007440	game pass is half as much on Steam, basically.
1008400	1010560	So anyway.
1013920	1017200	See other things that you talked about Elder Scrolls Online is
1017200	1019360	getting yet another piece of DLC.
1019400	1023560	So they are going to be introducing Necrom, which is taking place, I
1023560	1029240	guess, on an Eastern Morrowind and also introducing a new class of the
1029240	1033560	Arcanist and yeah, it looks pretty cool.
1033600	1036040	Still, I don't know.
1036640	1038960	I'm probably should give Elder Scrolls Online a try again.
1039520	1042480	I've tried giving this game a try and I got, I'm not into it.
1042480	1044720	Like I've tried, but maybe I, you know what?
1045720	1049040	I just I'm not into the Elder Scrolls universe at all.
1049040	1049520	Yeah.
1049520	1054240	I mean, I don't love it as much as Alan or even like Loki probably
1054240	1057560	does, but I tried to do I bought it when it first came out.
1057560	1059720	Actually, when it was on the Guild Wars model where you just
1059720	1062760	bought the game and no, we had a monthly fee at first, right?
1062760	1065200	I think I bought the game and like paid for a month or something
1065200	1067800	because I remember playing it before, but I just I couldn't
1067800	1068200	get into it.
1068200	1070240	But I know people that play it that really love it.
1070240	1078080	So, yeah, then they showed off some gameplay of Redfall, which
1078080	1083640	is their new game by Arkane Studios, Austin, and kind of
1083640	1086280	a vampire FPS type thing.
1086520	1088160	So they did a little bit of a deep dive there.
1088160	1092160	It's supposed to be coming out May 2nd and I think that was it.
1094560	1099440	Yeah, I don't know if this last game, the Redfall is super
1099440	1100960	up my alley, but it looks nice.
1101200	1105840	Like, you know, the artwork is very good and the graphics
1105840	1106560	and all that stuff.
1106560	1111160	It's, you know, it's very good looking.
1111160	1114160	Arkane makes good games with Dishonored and stuff.
1114160	1118200	So, I mean, yeah, it'd be worth checking out.
1118200	1119200	I don't know.
1119840	1121200	Yeah, we'll see.
1121200	1123000	Some other comments coming into chat.
1123000	1126280	QuestBuster saying I'd give ESO a try, but there's so much
1126280	1127600	to get caught up on on this point.
1127680	1130080	You know, there's a lot of MMOs that kind of have that problem, right?
1130480	1130880	Yeah.
1130880	1134960	I will say, having flirted with Warcraft again, even though
1134960	1138560	my sub is gone now, but for the month or two I was playing
1138560	1141440	it, I will say the catch up model they put in that game kind
1141440	1142320	of works really well.
1142320	1146400	Is that basically it's like for you to level from level one.
1146400	1148560	No, they have a starting area that takes you from one to
1148560	1152640	ten, and then you can pick any prior expansion or even float
1152640	1156320	between them if you want to get from ten to, I think, 60,
1156320	1157360	which was the old cap.
1157360	1159920	And then you go to Dragonflight to do the new cap 60 to 70.
1159920	1161840	I thought that was a smart way to do it because you can
1161840	1164640	kind of taste whatever expansion you want to do, you know,
1164640	1165840	and then do it that way.
1165840	1168320	So and then let's see.
1168320	1171280	Pelehatome on chat says I put like 100 hours into ESO and
1171280	1172800	then suddenly burned out.
1172800	1174960	QuestBuster says I remember being in the beta and it was
1174960	1177680	in rough shape, but it's really improved from what I understand.
1177680	1180800	So, yeah, some comments from chat.
1180800	1181920	Now, here's my question.
1181920	1185600	What did you think of the event as a whole?
1185600	1190480	Because we don't usually see a lot of directs like this where
1190480	1194080	it's they did a few games, and they did a real deep dive on
1194080	1196960	those games and spent like seven, eight minutes on each
1196960	1200480	game, as opposed to quick hit two minute trailers for a
1200480	1201440	bunch of things.
1201440	1203200	This was more of like a deep dive type of thing.
1203200	1207120	And, you know, Bobby had a comment that is, you know, in
1207120	1210000	line with where a lot of gamers are at in chat at twitch.tv
1210000	1213680	slash vog network saying, we wish we got more deeper dives
1213680	1216720	instead of just a pre rendered trailer does a deeper dive.
1216720	1217680	Man, that was boring.
1217680	1219120	Why couldn't that just been a trailer?
1220000	1222480	So is this just another case of gamers?
1222480	1225600	Gamers hate everything.com or what is it?
1225600	1227920	I guess it depends what their expectations are.
1227920	1230720	Like, I think when people hear Xbox Bethesda showcase, they
1230720	1234240	think of like E3 showcase type thing when this is more in
1234240	1238400	line of like, say, a state of play type thing that EA would
1238400	1240480	or not EA of Sony would do or something like that.
1240480	1242560	To be fair, they called it developer direct, which I don't
1242560	1243760	think I've ever heard him use before.
1243760	1245840	But I also completely understand.
1246800	1248480	And we've talked about this before, too.
1248480	1250560	Perception is everything.
1251280	1256240	You can call it deep dive on four game showcase.
1256240	1258960	People are still going to perceive it as something something
1258960	1261840	in this industry that happens all the time, right?
1261840	1262080	Yeah.
1262080	1262320	Yeah.
1262320	1265840	I mean, it's just like the where Nintendo come out with
1265840	1267120	like their indie showcases.
1267120	1270480	Like, listen, we are not showing Zelda.
1270480	1271920	We're not showing Zelda.
1271920	1273120	Don't expect Zelda.
1273120	1274080	Zelda will not be here.
1274080	1275120	We're not showing Zelda.
1275120	1277120	And then, like, you know, people say, why didn't they show
1277120	1284800	Zelda? Well, this might be the first E3 or that time period,
1284800	1288000	summer time period where we don't get gamers that fucking
1288000	1291280	say that because a Zelda game will have just come out in May.
1291280	1294400	You know, someone's still going to say it, but you would be
1294400	1295680	showing off a new Zelda.
1295680	1300160	You would think any gamer that fucking knows anything about
1300160	1302240	anything is going to be like, okay, they're not going to
1302240	1305680	announce a Zelda this summer right after they just released,
1305680	1307440	you know, Tears of the Kingdom.
1308080	1309840	Where's my Zelda maker?
1309840	1311440	Why aren't they showing Zelda maker?
1313680	1315840	No, now it'll be where's Metroid Prime 4?
1315840	1317120	That's going to be the new.
1317120	1318080	Where's Metroid Prime?
1318080	1321120	Did you know Metroid Prime 4 was rebooted four years ago?
1321120	1322400	Where is Metroid Prime 4?
1322400	1330080	I'm hoping that they do a remaster of 0gx, but, you know,
1330080	1332320	because that's been rumored for a while now, too.
1332320	1333920	Don't play with my heartstrings.
1333920	1334720	Who's right now?
1335520	1336160	Who's really that?
1336160	1339040	Who's TikTok is rumoring that you can say anything you want
1339040	1339680	on that platform.
1339680	1340800	No one's going to fact check you.
1342400	1343920	Literally, I swear to God.
1346800	1350400	All right, so I guess that's really it for the developer
1350400	1355040	recap, but is there anything that you kind of wish they'd
1355040	1356480	showed that they didn't show?
1356480	1360720	Like, obviously for me, you know, but I'm not saying this
1360720	1362240	is a negative against Microsoft.
1362240	1363920	I think they did a fine job.
1363920	1366240	I think if you listen to what they said, they set the
1366240	1368800	expectation where they set the expectation.
1368800	1371600	I think on top of that, they shadow released a hell of a
1371600	1374800	game that's now dominating the conversation this week.
1374800	1377200	Like I said, even above some games that have been hyped for
1377200	1378320	months and months.
1378320	1382640	And I think this HiFi Rush's release is going to change the
1382640	1386000	conversation on how some games are marketed.
1386000	1386640	It really is.
1387360	1390560	Not every game can get away with this, but this one can.
1390560	1394720	By the way, can I just say how wild is it on HiFi Rush?
1394720	1397760	This is specifically the studio that did, like, the Evil
1397760	1400160	Within did this.
1400800	1403840	Like, I'm sure there's people out there going, where's Evil
1403840	1404640	Within 3?
1404640	1405680	And I get it.
1405920	1408080	You want sequels to the games you love.
1408080	1410720	But then when you see stuff like this come out of it, it's
1410720	1415440	like, okay, but isn't it cool when a studio can, like, do
1415440	1416880	whatever they want to do?
1416880	1419520	Because you would have had this if they just went right into
1419520	1421840	making Evil Within 3, right?
1422960	1423680	I guess, yeah.
1426320	1431200	What I would like, I mean, like, just with Mojang, can you
1431200	1433440	please show me what you're doing with Minecraft, please?
1433920	1434800	Anything?
1434800	1438160	Like, we've been seeing trailers for Minecraft Legends.
1438160	1440400	It's like, okay, I don't want to see that.
1440400	1442880	Can you show me what you're doing with mainline Minecraft?
1442880	1446560	Because, like, what we get out of them lately, like, their
1446560	1450080	new thing that they showed off in a snapshot is armor trims.
1450080	1453760	It's literally, like, a stripe of color on armor.
1454800	1457760	That they've been working on this for two years, you guys.
1457760	1461360	The idea of putting a stripe on some armor, that's two years
1461360	1462080	in the making.
1462320	1467040	And it's like, okay, can you just show me what you're working
1467040	1469440	on? Like, what is the general, like,
1469440	1470560	It's Minecraft Legends.
1470560	1471600	Everybody's working on that.
1471600	1473360	Was it general?
1473360	1473920	Oh, exactly.
1473920	1476320	It was a general theme of, like,
1476320	1479200	Wouldn't it just be a simple texture and color assignment?
1479840	1484320	It is, but they have, it's sort of, not exactly.
1484320	1487600	So it is, they have to re-basically build the way the
1487600	1490560	armor is structured, like, tag-wise and everything.
1491120	1494800	They have to redesign, like, the different workstations to
1494800	1496400	allow for this new type of thing.
1497280	1499040	They're just retooling some of that stuff.
1499040	1501520	But it seems like it's such a minor thing.
1501520	1502880	It's like, excuse.
1502880	1506000	They spent a lot of time this week telling us about, like,
1506000	1509200	how excited, and people are, some people are excited about
1509200	1511120	it because, like, oh, cool, I can customize stuff.
1511120	1515200	But, like, it doesn't make a huge difference.
1515200	1516320	Like, it really doesn't.
1516960	1518800	It's just rebalancing stuff.
1518800	1521520	But if that doesn't tell me what the next update's about,
1521520	1523600	it just tells me that this is a thing that they're working
1523600	1525760	on that's totally independent from everything else.
1525760	1528400	But we still don't know what that is because, like,
1528400	1532320	we have, like, okay, there's these armor trims and we've
1532320	1536960	got bookshelves and we've got camels and we've got signs
1536960	1541760	that are hanging and we've got this prehistoric six-legged
1541760	1544720	turtle thing that sniffs up seeds.
1545600	1547280	What the heck does that have to do with anything?
1548240	1550800	It's just such a random assortment of things.
1551360	1554160	It's just like, here's all the stuff that we're working on
1554160	1556000	that we really don't have a place to fit it.
1556000	1557920	We're just going to put that all into an update.
1557920	1560480	But things that are, like, people have been asking for,
1560480	1565120	like stairs and slabs for concrete, for example, that is
1565120	1567840	literally something that they have the model built in.
1567840	1570320	They have the structures to be able to put this in the game.
1571200	1573920	All they literally would have to do is create the item.
1573920	1576320	The textures are already in the game.
1576320	1578000	The models are in the game.
1578000	1579840	It's just, it's literally setting up data.
1580400	1584800	It would take one person maybe an afternoon to do that,
1584800	1587600	but they don't do that because of course not.
1588720	1590400	It's just weird stuff.
1590400	1593280	I would have liked to have seen Fable, to be honest.
1593280	1593680	Yes.
1593680	1595120	That's the one I would have liked to see.
1595120	1598560	But I also understand, you know, like, again, I'm not shitting
1598560	1599520	on what they did show.
1599520	1602000	I thought it was fine, but yeah.
1602800	1604080	So, all right.
1604800	1606080	This sometimes happens.
1606080	1608560	While we're trying to do a show, but apparently we have
1608560	1609760	breaking news that's coming in.
1609760	1612640	We have breaking news right now that's coming in from the
1612640	1615680	chat. Of course, it's unsourced breaking news.
1615680	1618160	I'd like to know where this is coming from, but I'm trusting
1618160	1619280	the person who says it.
1619840	1621680	But apparently, oops, not the intro.
1621680	1627200	Apparently, Alan is saying that TwitchCon 2023 is in Vegas.
1628880	1630080	That that has just happened.
1630080	1635520	I did not see anything on the official TwitchCon Twitter or
1635520	1636880	Twitch Twitter.
1636880	1639920	So source, please look at their webpage.
1639920	1640560	I didn't.
1640560	1641920	So maybe that's where it's coming from.
1641920	1642640	But I'm just asking.
1643200	1644800	I'm asking Alan where the source is.
1646480	1647680	So we'll try to find that.
1648560	1653280	But let's say it's true.
1653840	1655440	How do you feel about that?
1655440	1656640	How would you feel about a TwitchCon?
1656640	1657920	It's not on their website yet.
1657920	1658640	Yeah.
1658640	1660560	Alan, did you get duped and share it with us?
1662880	1663760	I think he did.
1663760	1664720	He's not talking now.
1666480	1670720	Um, no, I saw this floating around like a month ago.
1672320	1676080	I mean, Vegas is a big convention town.
1676720	1680480	So it wouldn't be it wouldn't exactly be surprising.
1680480	1685760	I will say this Final Fantasy Fan Fest was in Vegas.
1685760	1688800	They were going to move to San Diego, but that was for the
1688800	1690080	2020 Fan Fest.
1690080	1692160	And we all know what happened to 2020.
1692160	1694240	So now they're going back to Vegas.
1694960	1698880	So I mean, it you do have conventions that ping pong a
1698880	1702480	little bit between like San Diego and Vegas and TwitchCon
1702480	1703680	has not always been in San Diego.
1703680	1705360	TwitchCon has moved around.
1705360	1706720	They've gone Long Beach.
1706720	1708320	They've been San Francisco.
1708320	1713040	So it's plausible that they could be going to Vegas.
1713040	1714800	I'm not going to believe anything until it's posted on
1714800	1715760	their website.
1715760	1716260	All right.
1717200	1721280	So Bobby is saying allegedly, the Pasqui Hotel reservation
1721280	1721920	got leaked.
1721920	1723920	And that is what is leading to this wildfire.
1724960	1725680	And there it is.
1725680	1727760	Alan is linking us the Pasqui.
1727760	1730000	Okay, so this is coming from pasqui.com.
1731280	1736000	And it does say TwitchCon Las Vegas, October 20th, 2023 to
1736000	1739120	October 22nd, 2023.
1739120	1742960	Okay, I'm willing to give this a lot more credit now because
1742960	1746320	I would not see something like this on pasqui.com.
1746320	1748400	And this is not some viral site.
1748400	1751200	This is, you know, a handmade site, but I would not see
1751200	1754560	something like that on pasqui.com if there wasn't something
1754560	1755060	to that.
1755680	1757680	So interesting.
1758320	1760640	But yes, Dark Soccer is probably right.
1760640	1762560	You should wait for the official announcement because dates
1762560	1765280	could still shift around until this is released to the public.
1765920	1767280	A lot of this can still change.
1767280	1768000	But thank you.
1768000	1770800	This is definitely now a where there's smoke, there's fire
1770800	1771680	type of situation.
1772480	1773360	So interesting.
1774480	1776880	I think Vegas is a great place for TwitchCon.
1776880	1779200	You're not going to have the problem about hotels or trying
1779200	1780560	to get around or anything like that.
1780720	1782720	Vegas is built to have conventions.
1782720	1784800	I would be curious where they're having it.
1784800	1787120	Are they having it at the actual convention center, which
1787120	1787520	is pretty big?
1787520	1789200	Or are they going to have it at one of the hotel convention
1789200	1793440	centers, which every hotel there is built to have a mid size
1793440	1794320	to huge convention.
1794320	1797840	I've been to conventions at not Treasure Island.
1797840	1798320	What's the other one?
1798320	1798820	Mirage.
1799760	1802000	And that was actually I think they're bulldozing the Mirage
1802000	1803600	though. So maybe that's not where it's going to be.
1805120	1806000	Who else had Paris?
1806000	1807760	The Paris had Fan Fest one year.
1807760	1808720	It was pretty good.
1808720	1811440	The Rio had Fan Fest a couple years.
1811440	1813120	I didn't like that one because it was off the strip.
1813680	1816640	That one's a little harder to get to because it's not on
1816640	1817920	the same line as the rest.
1817920	1820480	So interesting.
1820480	1820880	Wow.
1820880	1824480	Alan is saying, according to the same site, Pasqui could
1824480	1827440	show up on Tuesday for that.
1827440	1828240	That's wild.
1829680	1830960	Yeah, I'm with Bobby.
1830960	1832800	I'm going to black out the days anyway, just so I don't
1832800	1835360	schedule something else.
1836160	1837760	I get to do that when you go back to work.
1837760	1839600	That is Halloween.
1839600	1843760	And that is the season when I do a lot of hosting stuff.
1843760	1845280	So we'll see what happens.
1845280	1845760	Interesting.
1845760	1846160	Interesting.
1846160	1846480	All right.
1846480	1847840	Anyway, there's your breaking news.
1847840	1848480	Thank you, Alan.
1848480	1849520	And thank you for sourcing that.
1849520	1850160	I appreciate it.
1850720	1854160	Okay, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks, the
1854160	1856560	types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1856560	1857680	So Dark Soccer, I'll go to you.
1857680	1858560	How is your gaming week?
1859280	1860880	I played Star Ocean.
1860880	1862320	I've played Dead by Daylight.
1863840	1866240	I finally made Eerie 1, a survivor.
1868160	1871840	Um, that means I can fuck around and find out.
1872560	1874160	No, I just got to fuck around.
1874160	1875520	I don't care about finding out anything.
1878480	1880800	I've played my stupid word game.
1880800	1883360	I've been playing a lot of Midnight Suns on my own now that
1883360	1884960	I'm not limited to streaming it.
1885680	1886640	So that's all.
1887840	1890480	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1891280	1892640	It's all Minecraft still.
1893360	1897760	I finished building trees on the SMP now and basically
1898400	1901280	getting footage together to edit another episode together.
1901920	1903760	Although I should have done my modded series more.
1905600	1908480	I suppose I've made an episode in that sooner, but whatever.
1909760	1911760	Nothing matters because no one sees it.
1911760	1912320	It's fine.
1915760	1917120	All right, my gaming week.
1917680	1919600	I pretty much already talked about one of the big new games
1919600	1921280	I played this week, which is HiFi Rush.
1921280	1923600	I talked about that in the earlier segment where that was
1923600	1928240	relevant. Again, if the concept of a beatonetta game, Bayonetta
1928240	1930560	meets a beatmatching game, if that sounds attractive to you,
1930560	1932080	then you definitely should check out this game, especially
1932080	1932960	if you have Game Pass.
1932960	1934160	You know, it's one of those things where it's like, you're
1934160	1934800	paying for Game Pass.
1934800	1936080	Anyway, go check it out.
1936880	1939120	As far as other games I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy
1939120	1940640	XIV, still on that.
1940640	1943200	I tried to get a medium house in the lottery, but I didn't
1943200	1944240	win the medium house.
1944240	1944880	Boo.
1944880	1949200	Oh, well, I've also been playing Dead by Daylight, actually.
1949200	1953200	I prestiged finally Quentin and I got his Adept.
1953200	1954720	So, yeah, I did all that in one go.
1955680	1956400	Thank you.
1956400	1960080	Because his perks are very kind of situational.
1960080	1963040	Although I like his pharmacy perk.
1963040	1965840	I like that's very kind of stealthy because that's how you
1965840	1968320	can go into the match without an item and still get the
1968320	1971920	item. Hattie has a really good perk for flashlight bullies
1971920	1974080	on the same line, but I'm more of a healer than a flash.
1974080	1974400	I can't.
1974400	1976800	I can't flash my save to save my life.
1976800	1978960	So Hattie's perk is a pain in the ass.
1978960	1979200	Yeah.
1980720	1984160	So let's see, outside of Dead by Daylight, I did play one
1984160	1985440	other new game this week.
1986000	1989760	Let's talk about Niantic's new game that also released this
1989760	1990160	week.
1990160	1993120	So Niantic is the studio, of course, that brought us Pokemon
1993120	1993840	Go.
1993840	1996720	I've talked about other games that they've made, like Ingress,
1996720	1998880	Pikmin Bloom is one I quite enjoy.
1998880	2003680	And this week that same studio brought us NBA All World is
2003680	2004880	the game that they came out with.
2005680	2008880	And they've pretty much openly said in interviews, they're
2008880	2011680	trying to go for an audience that doesn't really go for
2011680	2012880	their games otherwise.
2012880	2017360	That sports game fans and sports game enthusiasts and Pokemon
2017360	2018960	have like a 10% overlap.
2018960	2021040	I think they threw that statistic out in one of their
2021040	2021680	interviews.
2021680	2024000	So they're trying to reach a new audience with this NBA All
2024000	2024640	World game.
2026160	2031360	Basically, in the game, you can go around in the places that
2031360	2035680	would normally be Pokestops would drop like items such as
2035680	2040400	XP up or new shoes or a different type of basketball.
2041280	2044720	And you also encounter players in the wild like they're
2044720	2045280	Pokemon.
2045280	2048560	That's the funniest part is that NBA players are now Pokemon.
2048560	2051120	So you encounter them in the wild and you basically it's
2051120	2053120	literally 1v1 me, bro.
2053120	2053920	That's what you do.
2053920	2056640	But it's a little more intricate of a game than in Pokemon
2056640	2059040	Go, how you just throw the ball and try to catch it.
2059040	2061600	In this one, you might do a shot drill like who can get the
2061600	2063120	most shots and so forth.
2063120	2065440	You might do it around the world type of thing.
2065440	2068560	Or you might actually do like a 1v1 type of minigame.
2068560	2071680	And this is also what you do when you want to take control
2071680	2075360	of the court, which is akin to Pokemon Go's gyms.
2076080	2080160	Now, because the Niantic Wayfarer and Waypoint and the
2080160	2083840	database of all their points of interest is pretty robust
2083840	2084720	at this point.
2084720	2088480	They've actually made it so that actual basketball courts,
2088480	2090960	whether they're at your public park or wherever they are,
2090960	2094160	actual basketball courts are basketball courts in the game.
2094160	2096800	And you basically fight to take control of them.
2097760	2102400	However, the basketball courts are occupied by bots at the
2102400	2105520	beginning of the week, and you want to be there longer than
2105520	2106560	anybody else.
2106560	2109040	So if you want to be at the top of the board, you have to
2109040	2113120	dethrone 10 bots to do it.
2114640	2115440	Here's the thing.
2116400	2119920	There's a lot about NBA World conceptually that I like.
2119920	2124400	I think they did take the Pokemon Go formula and tried to
2124400	2127840	make it a little more attractive to an audience that isn't
2127840	2130800	interested in Pokemon Go otherwise, like sports game fans,
2130800	2131840	like I get what they're going for.
2132800	2138640	But for this game, unlike Pokemon Go, unlike Pikmin, I feel
2138640	2142400	like the places of interest and the AR gaming element is
2142480	2146480	secondary to the basketball game that you play in it, which
2146480	2148720	to some people would be a very attractive point.
2148720	2149760	I get that.
2149760	2156240	But that also means that the basketball game in it has to
2156240	2156740	be good.
2157840	2160800	And the little mini basketball game that you play in it to
2160800	2165600	take control of a court, it gets repetitive real fast.
2166320	2168960	Do you throw the basket or the ball in the basket like the
2168960	2169760	Pokeballs?
2169760	2171280	No, it's not anything like that.
2171520	2174320	Basically, it's you versus another player.
2176720	2177600	It's a bot, really.
2177600	2181040	And you can move left or right and you can tap to juke or
2181040	2183360	you can hold to move, basically.
2183360	2185680	And then you kind of do that or you can move forward.
2185680	2187840	And if you get close to the basket, your character will try
2187840	2189040	to slam dunk it.
2189040	2193440	Or you can do like a shot thing from the three point range
2193440	2196080	where a little meter goes up and down and you try to release
2196080	2197360	it right at the point.
2197360	2199760	And if the other player didn't block, then you might score.
2201520	2205280	It's a very rudimentary, like old school 90s type of
2205280	2208720	basketball game, I guess, which is fine.
2208720	2210640	But I'm just going to be completely honest.
2210640	2214000	It sucks to play on a cell phone because we're back in the
2214000	2218880	classic problem, the classic problem that Niantic ought to
2218880	2221280	know better when it comes to developing cell phone games,
2221280	2223600	because they've been one of the only successful developers
2223600	2224960	to buck the trend.
2224960	2228080	And that is when you make a cell phone game, you want to
2228080	2231360	make you experience that's uniquely cell phone.
2231360	2235600	You don't want to shoehorn a console experience into a
2235600	2236720	mobile game.
2236720	2239600	That's the biggest problem with NBA All World.
2239600	2244720	It is a mediocre at best, really repetitive basketball
2244720	2248160	game that honestly ends up not being fun to play after a
2248160	2250960	certain amount of time because you're trying to move left
2250960	2252080	or no, I'm trying to juke.
2252080	2253200	Oops, I moved.
2253200	2254720	Oh, it thought my tap was a hold.
2258080	2259360	It controls like ass.
2260240	2264800	So I like a lot of cell phone games that aren't
2264800	2267120	intentionally meant to be cell phone games kind of do.
2267120	2269760	Like, I don't know why this game doesn't control better.
2269760	2270880	It's not fun to play.
2272400	2275680	I'm trying to have faith because a lot of the Niantic
2275680	2277440	games have gotten better with time.
2278240	2281280	I think Pikmin Bloom a year on is in a way better place
2281280	2282880	than it even was when it launched.
2282880	2286080	Pokemon Go has grown a lot in the years it's been out.
2286080	2287360	Some would say for the worse.
2287360	2292720	But when you consider year zero to, like, let's say right
2292720	2296960	before the pandemic, if you compare 2016 Pokemon Go to 2020
2296960	2299360	early 2020 Pokemon Go, I think you'd go, yeah, this game is
2299360	2301120	a lot better than it was when it first came out.
2301120	2303040	Some of the changes they've made since then, I understand
2303040	2304240	where people are upset.
2304240	2308320	I think NBA All World, if it doesn't really start to mix
2308320	2311920	up that experience and maybe have there be more of a point
2311920	2315440	to the AR end of things, I think it's going to fizzle out
2315440	2315920	real quick.
2316720	2319120	Sorry to say, because I want to support the Niantic stuff.
2319120	2321920	I love AR games, but I'm not going to make believe that I
2321920	2324640	enjoy this game more than I actually do, which is I don't
2324640	2327920	really feel like playing that fucking 1v1 game 10 times
2327920	2330400	while standing at the basketball court in the park just
2330400	2332960	to get some extra items that are probably going to fall out
2332960	2335680	of my inventory anyway, because the inventory system in the
2335680	2339040	game is laughably limited.
2339040	2340400	Laughably.
2340400	2341840	Like, what?
2343120	2346800	It's a cheap money grab to try to get you to expand your
2346800	2348320	bag space right off the bat.
2348320	2350560	When the initial release of the game, and I think it might
2350560	2353680	have fixed it since then, doesn't even warn you that you're
2353680	2354880	about to hit the cap.
2354880	2357760	Oh, by the way, if you try to claim items from an achievement,
2357760	2359840	those items go straight in the garbage.
2359840	2362240	You don't even have a chance to say, oh, let me get rid of
2362240	2364800	something else so I can claim these more rare items from an
2364800	2365440	achievement.
2365440	2367040	That really ticked me off.
2367040	2371040	So that part of it, like, yikes.
2371760	2374000	So do I recommend the NBA All World?
2374000	2374640	Not right now.
2375680	2379920	But maybe in a few months, unless you, like, love basketball.
2379920	2384560	And look, I promise you what I'm saying about this game does
2384560	2388080	not come from a place of, oh, Rob doesn't play sports games.
2388080	2390880	I guarantee those of you that are into sports games are going
2390880	2392880	to have the same impressions I had of this.
2392880	2395040	And I don't hate sports games just because they're sports
2395040	2395360	games.
2395360	2398960	In fact, I actually rather like a lot of the arcadey type
2398960	2400000	of sports games.
2400000	2404080	If the 1v1 mode was like NBA Jam, but actually controlled
2404080	2406400	well on a phone, I'd fucking be into that.
2406400	2407120	I sure would.
2408240	2408880	But it's not.
2409680	2410320	It's boring.
2411440	2413280	So there you go.
2413280	2414720	That's my review of NBA All World.
2416080	2418160	ZenMonkey11 says it controls like ass.
2418160	2419200	Should be in a game review.
2419200	2420960	If they want to put that on the store, that's fine.
2422400	2424720	Bobby Black Wolf says, yeah, it's interesting to see that
2424720	2427600	some kids can only use touch screen technology, either
2427600	2430400	tablets or phones, put them in front of a keyboard and mouse,
2430400	2431440	and they freeze up.
2431440	2434880	I would be shocked if even a child could do what they wanted
2434880	2435920	to do in this game.
2435920	2438160	Again, I'm telling you, I'm tapping to juke.
2438160	2439280	Oops, I moved.
2439280	2440960	Like, who thought that was a good idea?
2442640	2447680	Anyway, SG100Matt says I'm waiting for NHL World where
2447680	2449680	the gameplay is NHL 94.
2449680	2453280	Well, if the game does well, I'm sure they'll try to partner
2453280	2454560	with other sports things.
2454640	2459840	I would be curious what you get at NBA All World if you go
2459840	2464880	to the actual Golden One Center, which is, you know, I walk
2464880	2465760	downtown all the time.
2465760	2469120	I walk by Golden One Center and I know the actual NBA arenas
2469120	2472080	are like they're programmed to something different in the
2472080	2473840	game. So I don't know.
2473840	2477600	Will we get to see the beam, which is the big new thing in
2477600	2478880	Sacramento when the Kings win?
2478880	2480480	Light the beam, light the beam.
2482080	2483600	This is big purple beam.
2483600	2485280	They shoot up in the sky whenever the Kings win.
2485280	2486800	We don't get to see it that often, huh?
2487600	2492000	Actually, the Kings are having a better year than usual.
2492000	2494960	Like, they're like number three in the league right now.
2494960	2502080	It's the beam brought them alien space powers that they
2502080	2503200	didn't otherwise have.
2505280	2506400	Okay, there it is.
2506400	2506880	All right.
2506880	2512800	Anyway, of all the sports balls, basketball is probably
2512880	2515040	basketball and hockey are definitely my two favorites out
2515040	2515840	of all the sports balls.
2515840	2518000	I'm going to go with baseball and rugby.
2519520	2521520	All right, let's move on.
2522240	2523280	We'll get into some news.
2523920	2526160	Let's get into what else happened in the gaming world this
2526160	2527040	week. We'll go to Loki.
2528320	2528820	Yep.
2529440	2534400	So we had a story about League of Legends source code being
2534400	2539280	hacked. So apparently it is being held ransom right now.
2539520	2542640	They said that over the weekend, our analysis confirmed
2542640	2547760	source code for League TFT and Legacy anti-cheat platform
2547760	2551600	were exfiltrated by the attackers.
2552320	2554480	Today we received the ransom email.
2554480	2556000	Needless to say, we won't pay.
2558080	2558580	Okay.
2560880	2563760	And they haven't said that right now.
2563760	2566720	No player data or personal information have been taken.
2566720	2570560	But they said that the attack would slow down the release
2570560	2572560	of upcoming patches of its game.
2574160	2576400	Yeah, because somebody could use that source code pretty
2576400	2579280	dangerously to make cheats and things for the game.
2579280	2582080	League of Legends is very well known as a competitive type
2582080	2582580	of game.
2584080	2587680	Exploiting the source code for more accurate and under
2587680	2588960	the radar type of cheats.
2588960	2591840	That can be a very dangerous and deadly thing for League
2591840	2592400	of Legends.
2592960	2593200	Right.
2594080	2597360	Since the attack, we've been working to assess its impact
2597360	2600960	on anti-cheat and it'll be prepared to deploy fixes as quickly
2600960	2602240	as possible if needed.
2603440	2603680	Yeah.
2603680	2606800	I mean, considering they have the source for the anti-cheat
2606800	2607300	as well.
2608560	2610400	Well, I guess they're Legacy anti-cheat.
2611280	2612400	Well, good job, hackers.
2612400	2614000	Now they're going to have to put Denuvo in it.
2614000	2614720	So good job.
2614720	2615760	I'm just kidding.
2615760	2616080	Please.
2616080	2616480	Not bad.
2621200	2623040	Yeah, but that's well, I mean, kudos to them.
2623120	2626560	Putting their foot down and basically saying no, like we're
2626560	2629600	not, like we're not giving into ransom period and like making
2629600	2630640	that very explicit.
2630640	2634400	I mean, that's, it's a dangerous thing to do because I'm
2634400	2636080	sure that they'll just put it out.
2636080	2638240	Like, you know, they've got nothing to lose in that situation.
2638240	2640960	Yeah, or someone will leak the source code.
2640960	2643360	Then if they figure they can't get any money from it, they'll
2643360	2644400	just put it public.
2644400	2647760	I'm sure everybody will have access to their anti-cheat stuff.
2647760	2648260	Yeah.
2650080	2651840	So yeah, I was gonna say the worst that can happen, the
2651840	2653120	anti-cheat stuff happens.
2653120	2656000	You could also, I mean, if the source code were to get out
2656000	2658480	there, then hypothetically, people could kind of make their
2658480	2660160	own League of Legends leagues.
2660720	2663280	It would be frozen in time, so to speak, you know, it would
2663280	2666400	never get updated again, but you could use the current state
2666400	2668960	of the source code to basically make like a League of Legends
2668960	2671520	that would run on a different server set, right?
2671520	2674640	If, if that, for all I know, you know, hackers going to hack
2674640	2676640	that already exists for all I know, right?
2676640	2678560	Private servers for MMOs, right?
2678560	2681440	We know things like, you know, back in the day, Phantasy
2681440	2685600	Star Online, Blue Burst, and all that had fucking private
2685600	2686240	servers.
2686240	2687280	Wow, had private servers.
2687280	2688640	Eleven still has private servers.
2690400	2692160	I'm sure 14 has private servers.
2692160	2693360	I just don't know about them.
2693360	2695120	You know, most MMOs have private servers.
2695120	2697600	I'm sure League of Legends is actually probably no different.
2697600	2699760	I'm just not embedded in the community enough to know about
2699760	2702960	them, but this is going to make that a lot stronger too in
2702960	2704240	that whole scene.
2704240	2707360	But I mean, if League of Legends is a really competitive
2707440	2710000	game, this might also be one of those, if a tree falls in
2710000	2712000	the middle of the woods, does anyone actually hear it?
2712000	2714800	Because if you're the king of the hill on a private server,
2714800	2715280	who cares?
2715280	2716560	It's not the real deal, right?
2717440	2720080	It matters to those people on the private server, but not
2720080	2722880	to the League community as a whole, likely.
2722880	2726400	Again, I'm not super embedded in the League community, so
2726400	2729680	I can't profess to know, but I would imagine that it doesn't
2729680	2731840	really matter if you're king of the hill on a private server.
2733520	2735440	Anyway, all right.
2736400	2742160	Maybe a game that you will be more competitive on that will
2742160	2746000	get people to notice would be Advance Wars, the remake, if
2746000	2747760	this ever actually comes out.
2747760	2752400	But it does seem like a recent listing for Walmart, and it
2752400	2753040	doesn't end there.
2753040	2756080	Best Buy, Amazon Canada, EB Games.
2756080	2760720	They are now relisting Advance Wars 1 plus 2 reboot.
2760720	2763040	You may remember this collection was originally announced
2763040	2766080	for the Nintendo Switch, and then it was bumped back.
2766080	2768880	It was originally announced in December 2021, but it was
2768880	2772480	pushed back indefinitely because of Russia's military invasion
2772480	2776560	of Ukraine, and some of the storyline in Advance Wars hits
2776560	2779440	a little close to home with that whole topic.
2779440	2782080	So for the game to have come out when it was originally
2782080	2784960	scheduled, Nintendo felt, reading the room, that it would
2784960	2786000	have been in poor taste.
2786720	2790000	Even though that conflict is still going on a year from now,
2790000	2793360	perhaps Nintendo is reading the room that people are just
2793360	2797520	immune to it now, or they're not going to feel it's in poor
2797520	2798960	taste or whatever it is.
2800080	2803040	They're possibly going to be releasing the game sooner if
2803040	2805520	these retail listings are to be believed.
2806560	2809680	It's showing up at the retail sites, but we don't know when.
2809680	2813120	I'm not seeing a win on these sites, just that the entry is
2813120	2816320	showing back up on these sites, which would indicate that a
2816320	2818880	release is coming in the somewhat near future.
2818960	2820960	It could be something that's all the way at the holiday, for
2820960	2821460	all we know.
2822400	2825120	It could be a stealth release during the next Nintendo Direct.
2825120	2827600	It could be a lot of things, so you just have to wait and
2827600	2828320	see, I suppose.
2829200	2832080	DarkTitsia in chat says, I'd imagine Nintendo's first direct
2832080	2835520	of 2023 might give us the date for Advance Wars 1 and 2,
2835520	2837920	especially if we're seeing these listings all pop up.
2837920	2840800	Yes, probably that or E3, I imagine.
2843040	2848560	And when I say E3, E3 means not just actual E3 because we
2848560	2850480	really don't know what that's going to look like this year.
2850480	2854080	I use E3 on this show now to mean the summer announcement
2854080	2857040	period, and not E3 included.
2857040	2858880	Summer Game Fest, all of it, June.
2860240	2863040	sj100matt says, I've been excited for this Advance Wars
2863040	2866160	reboot, but yeah, totally get why they delayed it.
2866160	2870160	sj100matt, do you think it matters now?
2870160	2872560	Do you think people are going to say, oh, and I open this up
2872560	2876800	to anyone, not just Matt, that oh, now, even though there's
2876800	2880640	still a war going on that Russia did start with Ukraine,
2880640	2881680	it's not finished.
2882320	2884640	In fact, it's only getting more complicated, actually.
2885280	2888400	But just due to the length of time, we just don't care now?
2888960	2889600	I'd be curious.
2891840	2895040	sj100matt does say, I do wonder how much additional polish
2895040	2897200	they've done with it being delayed a year.
2897200	2899840	Part of me hopes they balance things because the game was
2899840	2901360	pretty unbalanced to some points.
2901360	2903280	You know, that's another pretty good point, though, is that
2903920	2908960	this delay has allowed them to go back and, you know, polish
2908960	2911680	things up a little bit, get the dirt off the car, so to speak,
2912560	2915440	with the game and release it in a tip top shape.
2915440	2916560	It'd be interesting.
2916560	2916960	We'll see.
2919280	2922480	Matt goes on to continue, I think the blow has been softened.
2922480	2924960	Does it make it any less right in the scope of things,
2924960	2926240	releasing it out?
2926240	2927760	Yeah, or releasing it now?
2927760	2931680	Yeah, I mean, for me, like, it's not like Nintendo started
2931680	2933200	the situation that's going on.
2933200	2937760	You know, sometimes art imitates life in unintended ways.
2938320	2941680	And I don't think anybody's going to go, God, Nintendo,
2941680	2943440	what a tacky ass thing to do, right?
2943440	2948160	Well, actually, the way social media is these days, maybe.
2948960	2953680	They put out Call of Duty Modern Warfare, so Modern Warfare 2,
2953680	2955920	so I don't really think that, you know...
2957280	2960640	If anyone critically thinks about it for a few moments,
2960640	2963040	they'll realize this is a remake of a game that was out
2963040	2965360	a long time ago before any of this.
2965360	2968080	So, and as Joe and Hunter Matt points out, other war games
2968080	2970080	have come out since the conflict has started.
2970080	2972640	So, all right, moving on.
2972640	2974320	Let's go to a different type of game.
2974320	2974960	Dark Sakura.
2976880	2983440	For people who are into leaked footage, over 10 minutes of
2984400	2988720	some early Horizon multiplayer gameplay has been leaked
2988720	2989360	on Reddit.
2989920	2993520	Funny enough, they said that the post was deleted,
2993520	2997120	but on the link that I clicked, I could still see it,
2997120	2998720	even though it said deleted post.
3000080	3002960	But they said that the footage is from an old alpha build
3002960	3008000	from summer 2020 that was the Horizon Forbidden West alpha
3009040	3010880	that was, you know, going around.
3012320	3016320	And another person who actually had knowledge of the project
3016400	3019440	believed that the footage and art was authentic.
3021920	3025600	Guerrilla did confirm in December they're planning to,
3025600	3028880	and I quote, expand the world of Horizon with an online co-op
3028880	3032640	with a cast of new characters, and that they were planning
3032640	3035120	for a trilogy of Horizon games.
3035120	3041680	So it's not unbelievable what this footage might be,
3041680	3043360	which by the way, I did save it.
3044160	3051760	But I mean, I don't know why the alpha footage would cause
3051760	3056160	such a big deal, but it has to be from concepts that are
3056160	3058640	going to be coming out or, you know, company secrets.
3058640	3060400	I don't know, but it looks good.
3060400	3061520	It looks pretty.
3061520	3063760	I'm also choosing not to play it now in case there are
3063760	3064960	takedown requests going on.
3064960	3068800	I don't want to jeopardize the archive, but it's on the
3068800	3070000	Internet. It's out there.
3070000	3071600	If you know where to look, you'll find it.
3072560	3073360	Find it eventually.
3074320	3077440	But I liked Horizon.
3077440	3078960	I haven't played Forbidden West yet.
3078960	3080400	I keep waiting to get a PS5.
3080400	3085040	But actually, quick aside, PS5s are showing up in the wild.
3085040	3086960	I keep saying I'm not going to get one until I can walk
3086960	3087920	into Target and buy one.
3087920	3088640	Well, guess what?
3088640	3091840	I checked the Target app the other day and PS5s are, like,
3091840	3095840	in stock locally, but not at the one I usually shop at.
3096480	3098240	So that saved me so far.
3098240	3100080	But now I'm also at the point.
3100080	3101360	Have you all heard those rumors?
3101920	3103760	A refresh in April or so.
3104560	3108240	Now I'm kind of like, I don't want to get one until, like,
3109040	3111040	the game I have to play is out.
3112080	3112480	Yeah.
3112480	3114880	Bobby says, I just heard Rob moving the goalpost.
3114880	3115680	Absolutely.
3115680	3116560	You did.
3116560	3117360	Absolutely.
3117360	3117840	You did.
3117840	3121200	Because if I don't move the goalpost, I'm going to tell you
3121200	3122240	what's going to happen.
3122240	3124640	I'm going to go buy one of those things at Target tomorrow.
3124640	3127600	And then literally the next day, Sony's going to be like,
3127600	3130240	we're doing a direct and we're announcing the PS5 slim.
3131040	3134960	There's also keep in mind the whole smoke there's fire things.
3135600	3138400	Haven't they already identified that there's a disk drive
3138400	3141040	available out in the wild that's meant to be sold separately
3141040	3142640	with a possible digital refresh?
3142640	3145200	Because the disk drive doesn't work with the current digital
3145200	3146240	only system.
3146240	3148480	So something's being cooked up out there.
3149760	3152880	The question is, is it before Final Fantasy 16?
3152880	3154160	Or is it a holiday release?
3155600	3156100	We'll see.
3156100	3160500	Didier Ramirez says, I'll preorder Final Fantasy 7 Remake
3160500	3163460	part two, but I'll still wait on the PlayStation 5 Remake.
3163460	3164660	Yeah, that's going to be another.
3164660	3168660	Like, is Final Fantasy 7 Re...
3168660	3169700	I forgot the name of it.
3169700	3170740	Not remake, but Re...
3172180	3173700	What's the second part called?
3173700	3174740	Not recoded.
3174740	3175240	Re...
3175620	3176420	Revolution.
3176980	3178020	What is it called?
3178020	3180580	The second part of the remake has a subtitle.
3182500	3184740	Is that this holiday as well?
3185700	3186980	Is it Rebirth?
3186980	3187300	That's it.
3187300	3187620	Thank you.
3187620	3188120	Rebirth.
3190020	3194980	Oh, which is I'm trying not to spoil for those that still
3194980	3196980	haven't played the Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
3196980	3200820	But like, Rebirth is a very appropriate subtitle.
3200820	3201220	Just saying.
3201220	3204820	Have not played through all of it yet, but it's fine.
3204820	3205380	It's fine.
3205380	3210020	It's my own fault if I get spoiled for me at this point.
3210020	3211620	Because I'm about to blurt it out.
3211620	3212340	But I'm not going to.
3212340	3213540	I don't care.
3213540	3215540	But one of these days, it's just going to fall out my mouth.
3216260	3216760	All right.
3217700	3218200	Anyway.
3218980	3219220	Yeah.
3219220	3221700	Oh, Rama says they did say Winter 2023.
3221700	3222500	Holy moly.
3222500	3223060	That'll be...
3223060	3225540	Oh, this is going to be such a big year for games.
3227540	3228340	All right.
3228340	3231700	Anyway, unfortunately, even though we are looking at a very
3231700	3236100	big year in games, this story is having a part two this week,
3236100	3237620	which is unfortunate, right, Loki?
3238420	3238660	Yeah.
3238660	3240660	So more layoffs in the...
3241300	3245860	Well, in this case, it's the games journalism portion
3245860	3247460	of the industry.
3247460	3252980	So the Washington Post was visited by CEO, entrepreneur,
3252980	3256020	born in 1964, Jeffrey Bezos.
3256020	3258660	And he came in and said, uh-uh, we're not doing no more
3258660	3259460	gaming anymore.
3259460	3260180	We're down to that.
3260740	3261860	We're print media.
3261860	3265460	And obviously behind the times with stuff.
3265460	3270580	So they laid off a good portion of the staff, including
3270580	3274420	what they said, 30 vacancies, and that will go unfulfilled
3274420	3276980	and 20 staff who no longer have jobs.
3278580	3281380	And so they're saying that they're going to be cutting
3282900	3283860	different sections out.
3283860	3286340	But yeah, the gaming section would be one that is...
3286340	3287540	Why doesn't he cut his salary?
3290500	3291000	That...
3291940	3293780	He needs his billions of dollars.
3293780	3294820	No, he doesn't.
3294820	3295460	I'm sorry.
3295460	3298580	When he comes out and says we're a print journalism.
3298580	3300020	Look, I understand.
3300020	3301220	I respect.
3301220	3303860	Print is a great thing to have in your hands and so forth.
3303860	3306020	But it's very not forward thinking.
3306020	3307060	Bobby had a comment.
3307060	3309140	It was actually on a different story.
3309140	3310100	Here it is.
3310100	3313380	Bobby said earlier in chat, yeah, it's interesting to see
3313380	3317300	that some kids can only use touchscreen technology, either
3317300	3319460	tablets or phones, put them in front of a keyboard and mouse
3319460	3320420	and they freeze up.
3320420	3324740	I've seen some babies toddlers try to swipe and zoom a
3324740	3325380	magazine.
3329220	3332180	Yeah, I've seen the stories too and talking about like, even
3332180	3338260	like, people of like, this generation who are now getting
3338260	3341780	into the workforce who have never had computers and stuff
3341780	3344820	being confused, basically being like kind of how we would
3344820	3349060	see, oh, hey, that those those older people at the job.
3349060	3351300	They don't know anything about computers and stuff.
3351300	3352900	But it's like that now.
3352900	3354820	I don't know if that's necessarily the same, though.
3354820	3359940	Like, I know my kids are working with, like, net, not net
3359940	3362740	books, but they have like Chromebooks and stuff in school.
3363380	3365540	And I mean, obviously, I'm doing the right thing by raising
3365540	3366420	them with computers.
3366420	3370020	But like, yeah, they don't know how to troubleshoot things
3370020	3374500	like I used to know, because, you know, growing up on a 286
3374500	3376340	or what, I don't know if that was a 286.
3376340	3379140	But old computer DOS.
3379140	3382340	Sometimes those Chromebooks feel like 286 is just to be
3382340	3384180	clear, they run just as fast.
3386100	3388260	It's hard to believe that they're actually faster than
3388260	3393700	that. No, it's, it's like, you know, you don't, you're not
3393700	3397300	forced to critically, like, solve those problems and stuff.
3397300	3400180	And so yeah, it's like, you're not going to have those skills.
3400180	3402580	And honestly, that really does help me in my day to day
3402580	3405620	stuff. Like, I can, I can critically solve a lot of problems
3405620	3408180	and technical stuff that nobody else can.
3408180	3410900	You need to get those kiddos on PC building simulator,
3410900	3413140	Prompto, Prompto, you need to get them.
3413140	3414420	I think they have it.
3414420	3416820	It's just, you know, it's not a fun game they won't play.
3418900	3421620	No, there's, you know, I don't know, but they know how to,
3421620	3423060	like, at least use a computer.
3423620	3426020	My son even accidentally updated to Windows 11.
3426020	3429540	So I mean, like, he's, they know what they're doing somewhat.
3430180	3434820	But it's, yeah, I do find it weird that there's people that
3434820	3438420	don't understand how to do certain things in the workplace,
3438420	3442500	or like, even just like, regular adults, like, like, like,
3442500	3447060	our jobs, like most most office jobs, like require knowledge
3447060	3450020	of Microsoft, the Microsoft Office products, you know, like,
3450020	3451300	you should know how to use Excel.
3452020	3453780	There are people that have been in like, some of these
3453780	3456340	companies for years that don't know how to use Excel.
3456340	3458660	And I'm like, how do you not know how to use Excel?
3458660	3461540	It is literally one of the job requirements.
3461540	3464660	You literally have had training on it multiple times.
3465540	3466900	How do you not know how to do this?
3467620	3469380	Because they don't want to know how to do it.
3469380	3469860	Exactly.
3469860	3470580	There's a lot of-
3470580	3472900	And they think that if they don't learn how to do it,
3472900	3474500	someone else will do it for them.
3474500	3475940	And that's what ends up happening.
3475940	3479860	And that person is unfortunately me.
3479860	3484500	It's called, I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts
3484500	3487220	where they were talking about willful stupidity or willful
3487220	3490740	ignorance like that, where it's easier to say, I don't know
3490740	3493700	how to do something and feign it, even if they know how to
3493700	3498500	do it, because then it, it pushes it off on someone else
3498500	3499220	for them to do.
3500100	3502820	Yeah, not to go into the complaining about my work,
3502820	3504980	because I could do that for literally hours.
3504980	3509220	Um, they, there's a lot of, you'll get a lot of people
3509220	3512500	saying, well, um, like when you ask them to do something
3512500	3514980	correctly or to just like slow down to check your work
3514980	3517860	and stuff, and they literally get, well, I'm busy.
3517860	3519620	So I'm just going to do things quickly.
3519620	3521940	Not going to ask questions, not going to check my work.
3521940	3525700	It's just going to be wrong because I need to get it done.
3525700	3528020	I'm so glad that that doesn't fly at my work.
3528580	3530900	It's just, it's ridiculous.
3532900	3537300	It goes into the people I think that are hired.
3537300	3539940	I mean, honestly, people, it's become an ingrained part
3539940	3543780	of society and it needs to be dis-engrained.
3543780	3547460	There needs to be, you know, let, let them catch the,
3547460	3549460	the, the consequences for not doing their job.
3549460	3550820	There are none.
3550820	3551140	Yeah.
3551140	3553780	Unfortunately there are none and it's more of a, it's a
3553780	3556500	culture where those type of people fail upwards.
3556500	3560740	So, um, Deidre, Deidre on chat says, I had a user come
3560740	3562900	in and not know how to shut down or restart their laptop.
3562900	3563860	I swear to you on this.
3563860	3566340	I told her to reboot and she Google searched how to restart
3566340	3566980	Windows 10.
3567700	3569140	And this was a Gen Z-er.
3569140	3572340	This is not your stereotypical, like, okay, boomer type
3572340	3573460	of situation.
3573460	3575780	And let me, let me pair that with Bobby's comment here.
3575780	3578100	This is shaping up to be the first generation where the
3578100	3580820	parents know more about how to use computers than their kids.
3581380	3583780	I do think there's a part of that though, where it's like,
3583780	3586020	well, probably cause touch screens and that whole thing,
3586020	3588740	like is going to be the future by the time the kids are in
3588740	3589700	the working world.
3589700	3592100	I think a lot of the working tools are going to be more
3592100	3593380	situated to that platform.
3593380	3598180	So there's that, but yeah, like, I just keep thinking of
3598180	3604580	this scene from the, the Star Trek search for Spock.
3605460	3608420	Were they not that, that one, it was a Star Trek four.
3608420	3609060	I think it was four.
3609060	3610420	The one where they went back and got the whales.
3610420	3611060	The voyage home?
3612420	3614020	No, I don't think it was.
3614020	3614660	I don't know.
3614660	3618420	Yeah, it was Star Trek four where Scotty picks up the mouse
3618420	3619700	and goes, hello computer.
3620340	3622500	And then, oh, a keyboard.
3622500	3623140	How quaint.
3624340	3626660	I mean, and I want to say like Deidre on mess.
3626660	3630180	So like, uh, to be fair and I'm going to give major props
3630180	3634660	here, at least they took it on themselves to Google search
3634660	3635300	how to do it.
3635300	3637860	Like, I don't have a problem with someone not knowing
3637860	3640580	something, it being very obvious, but you'd be surprised
3640580	3643700	the people that don't, if you don't know something that
3643700	3647220	they're actually seeking to know the answer, to figure it
3647220	3648020	out themselves.
3648020	3651700	And I'm telling you right now that, that, you know, trait
3651700	3653700	about a person is so rare nowadays.
3653700	3655380	It's just, it's ridiculous.
3655380	3658180	So like, yeah, it is stupid that you'd have to do that,
3658180	3661620	but props for them to like, try to figure it out on their
3661620	3661940	own.
3661940	3664740	So absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
3664740	3667380	We should acknowledge that they tried.
3667380	3668020	Absolutely.
3668020	3669300	Give them a gold star for that.
3669300	3674500	You tried, but no, I honestly, yes, you're right.
3674500	3676980	At least that person tried to fix the problem themselves
3676980	3678900	and research the answer.
3678900	3682020	We should, we should acknowledge at least that, at least
3682020	3682260	that.
3684660	3685060	All right.
3686740	3690420	Oboe 47, hi, welcome to the station, says transparent
3690420	3693140	aluminum, or aluminium, depending on where you're from,
3693140	3695380	was patented before that movie came out.
3697460	3704100	And Oboe was a really cool Wraith player who killed us all
3704100	3706500	and then was really nice and came in to my chat.
3707300	3708660	I went against a Wraith today.
3708660	3709460	I got out though.
3710020	3710500	I'm just kidding.
3712820	3713220	All right.
3716020	3717620	To which Wraith is old news.
3717620	3718660	It's all about Sadako now.
3718660	3718900	All right.
3719940	3722420	Sjoan Hunter Matt says, congrats, you did the bare minimum.
3722420	3725140	Yes, very much in that particular case.
3725140	3725540	All right.
3728100	3731700	Anyway, so I wanted to go back to the original comment that
3731700	3734740	started this whole derailment, which was the executives
3734740	3738740	comment about the layoffs, which still seemed very okay
3738740	3739940	boomer to me.
3739940	3746020	Like, he laid off a team that he didn't put any effort into
3746020	3750180	promoting because he doesn't get it.
3750180	3752740	Like, he didn't bother to Google.
3752740	3753780	What is a video game?
3755140	3757620	If he had Googled, how much money does the gaming industry
3757620	3760420	make? Did he lay off the Hollywood team?
3760420	3761380	Because guess what?
3761380	3762820	Gaming makes more than Hollywood.
3763620	3763780	Right.
3763780	3766740	Well, basically, he said we have no, they said that we've
3766740	3769620	received no clear explanation for why these layoffs had
3769620	3770100	to happen.
3770660	3774180	As far as we could tell, they're not financially necessary
3774180	3777460	or rooted in any coherent business plan from our publisher
3777460	3780340	who has said he expects the company to be larger a year
3780340	3780840	from now.
3782020	3786420	So I guess I don't know.
3787460	3789300	We're getting to lay all these people off and pay them
3789300	3790820	severance just to hire them back later.
3790820	3791620	Is that what we're saying?
3792900	3796180	I mean, I don't know.
3796500	3800180	Is he mad at, like, the gaming industry or something?
3800180	3802260	I mean, you do realize you own Twitch, right?
3806260	3806980	And Luna.
3806980	3807480	For now.
3809460	3814980	Why don't we talk about something that, like, does anyone
3814980	3818740	remember that Twitch has a cloud, Amazon has a cloud platform?
3818740	3820580	Does anyone remember that?
3820580	3825140	Here on Amazon's video game service, video game?
3825940	3829140	How often does Amazon like to remind you that Luna, like,
3829860	3830660	exists?
3831220	3833540	Yes, I know you can go into Prime Gaming and find some
3833540	3834340	things here and there.
3834340	3836820	I know there's maybe an ad that gets inserted here and there
3836820	3837140	as well.
3837140	3839940	But are they really trying as hard as they ought to?
3841220	3843620	I just realized I'm doing the period ads without even
3843620	3844660	thinking about it.
3845780	3846260	Period.
3849620	3853700	It just goes to show Amazon is a very siloed company.
3853780	3857060	All right.
3859540	3860340	I can't see.
3860340	3863460	And Chat says, one reason why I didn't go the PC route for
3863460	3866340	gaming is because of accessibility, sifting through menus,
3866340	3868660	tweaking, optimization, and upkeep.
3868660	3871620	And I remember from your story, I think you came in here
3871620	3873860	from one of Dar Sakura Stadia interviews.
3874820	3877460	The neat thing about cloud gaming, you know, I don't know
3877460	3880020	if we're there yet with all of these, but there's a lot of
3880020	3883060	cloud games you could just pick up and go, right?
3883060	3885140	You don't have to worry about menus, configuration, or any
3885140	3885460	of that stuff.
3885460	3886180	Just pick up and go.
3887060	3889300	I do think there's going to be more and more cloud gaming in
3889300	3889780	the future.
3889780	3892580	I just, you know, Google was the wrong company.
3892580	3894660	Unfortunately, I think we all recognize that now.
3894660	3896260	The right tech, but the wrong company.
3899220	3901540	Anyway, let's see.
3902660	3905460	Let's move on to another story, which is unfortunately in
3905460	3906820	the same kind of realm.
3908260	3912580	But it's an executive who normally I think this guy has
3912580	3913460	his stuff together.
3913460	3915780	So I want to dive into these comments a little bit, and this
3915780	3918500	has to do with Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox.
3919140	3922900	And this is further comment on 343 Industries and what's
3922900	3925380	going on with the Halo franchise and all that stuff.
3926180	3930180	In an interview with IGN, Phil Spencer said, the heart and
3930180	3934740	soul of Halo is with 343 and the teams that there, and I
3934740	3938020	have the utmost confidence in the team that's there and
3938020	3941140	leading and the plan that they have going forward.
3941140	3945060	This, of course, after 343 last week was per reports hit
3945060	3948500	hard by Microsoft's company wide layoffs.
3948500	3951540	We don't know exactly how many employees were let go, but
3951540	3954340	the Halo Infinite team, according to reporting, did see
3954340	3958020	significant cuts, which led to some chat online that they
3958020	3961140	were no longer going to do Halo, to which 343 put out a
3961140	3964100	brief statement saying, Halo and Master Chief are here to
3964100	3967620	stay. 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo now and
3967620	3970660	in the future, including Epic Stories multiplayer and more
3970660	3972500	of what makes Halo's great.
3973460	3975860	Phil Spencer said the layoffs were an effort by Microsoft
3975860	3977620	to position 343 for the future.
3978420	3980900	What we're doing now is we want to make sure that leadership
3980900	3983540	team is set up with the flexibility to build the plan that
3983540	3984580	they need to go build.
3985140	3988580	Halo will remain critically important to what Xbox is doing
3988580	3992820	and 343 is critically important to the success of Halo.
3992820	3996180	Unfortunately, nothing further because a logical follow-up
3996180	3998740	question you would ask in that case is, okay, so what is next
3998740	3999300	for Halo?
4000260	4003380	Phil Spencer said, I'm going to let 343 talk about the plans
4003380	4004740	that they have right now.
4004740	4007700	I expect that we'll be continuing to support and grow Halo
4007700	4010900	for as long as the Xbox is a platform for people to play.
4010900	4013540	So walking a very safe line there.
4014900	4018180	I mean, it's kind of a whole lot of nothing.
4019140	4021220	I understand Phil Spencer's in a weird position.
4021220	4024900	The one thing I don't like that he said is the whole like
4024900	4027940	it's positioning the leadership team to move forward with
4027940	4033060	Halo. How much of this is the leadership team's fault in
4033060	4033700	the first place?
4035300	4038260	I realize he can't say that in a public interview with IGN
4038260	4040100	when he's a publicly traded company.
4040100	4042740	I just kind of I wonder behind the scenes.
4044020	4045780	The wonder behind the scenes, that's all.
4047060	4051220	All right, let's move on to a simpler time in our next
4051220	4053620	segment. I think it is overdue at this point.
4057940	4068260	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where
4068260	4071780	I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell
4071780	4072740	you about it.
4072740	4075380	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4079380	4081460	And Dark Sakura, what did you pick this week?
4082820	4083860	Picked words with friends.
4086100	4086980	For reasons.
4088100	4091060	Well, I mean, actually, go ahead.
4091060	4092580	I'll leave my opinion for the end.
4093300	4093800	Yeah.
4094980	4099060	Well, I basically I like my word scapes game and I was like,
4099060	4101380	you know, this all started with Scrabble.
4101380	4103300	And it made me think about words with friends.
4103300	4106100	And now we're like on the sequel version or something.
4106740	4109940	So words with friends was developed by a company called
4109940	4112340	New Toy published by Zynga.
4113140	4119620	And it is basically Scrabble that you can play online with
4119620	4124980	people. There's also a Solitaire mode that I really enjoyed
4124980	4125940	the Solitaire mode.
4125940	4131780	That was kind of my jam, but it was connected to Facebook
4131780	4134500	or just through regular username contacts.
4136020	4140580	And then you can also be randomly assigned through smart
4140580	4145060	matches, you know, there were community matches, you know,
4145060	4146100	things like that.
4146100	4148260	But it was cross platform when it was released.
4148900	4154580	It was on iOS, on Windows Phone, Android.
4154580	4157220	You could play it on Facebook, Kindle Fire and a Nook.
4159860	4164180	There was a chat feature that you could use to talk with
4164180	4166100	your opponents and other people.
4166660	4172100	And between 2010 and 2011, it was one of the top ranking
4172100	4173700	games in the iOS app store.
4174260	4179380	There was an ad free and a paid version that had no ads.
4181060	4185860	In May 2017, words with friends was the most popular mobile
4185860	4187140	game in the US.
4187140	4191540	And then the sequel came out September 2017.
4191540	4194180	I mean, it really is basically Scrabble.
4194180	4199380	It has the Scrabble distribution, the point values, all
4199380	4199700	of it.
4199700	4203620	It follows the Scrabble dictionary and remind me never to
4203620	4208500	play with Bobby as in our friends in Southern California,
4208500	4210100	because I thought you meant Mr.
4210100	4210660	Black Wolf.
4211220	4213220	No, I mean, I know he did.
4213220	4214500	Yeah, Barbara.
4214500	4215140	Other Bobby.
4215140	4218420	Yeah, because she knows legal terms.
4218420	4219540	We don't play with her anymore.
4219540	4225940	But you also have your double letter or triple letter and
4225940	4227460	then your double word and triple word.
4229860	4234500	And then if a player can use all the seven tiles on a single
4234500	4238660	play, also known as a bingo in Scrabble, you get 35 bonus
4238660	4244580	points. I got that once and it was amazing.
4245220	4252820	So you can also get some different arrangements as you
4252820	4254340	play. It can change each time.
4255540	4260420	You also have a reassign feature and you can also pass your
4260420	4265060	turn. You can also swap to and you can look up what tiles
4265060	4266420	are left in your tile bag.
4267540	4271780	So yeah, it's a little interesting.
4271780	4275700	You can get power ups for word clue and word radar and
4275700	4276420	things like that.
4279780	4283380	And then there was a feature that was temporarily removed.
4283380	4286820	It was called Hindsight that let a player pay for the
4286820	4290500	opportunity to see what the highest scoring moves on the
4290500	4293220	board were after the play was made.
4293220	4294340	But they brought it back.
4295140	4303140	You can do random opponents and actually what I'm reading,
4304660	4310420	a lady in Chicago met up, started chatting with an opponent
4310420	4311380	from the Netherlands.
4312020	4316340	They chatted the whole time and got married three years
4316340	4317940	later. Sorry, two years later.
4317940	4318440	Wow.
4319160	4323480	Another one in Georgia and Texas.
4326760	4331800	Yeah, and there was even one I was reading about an American
4331800	4337480	player communicating about an Australian opponent's medical
4337480	4344360	symptoms and the American, the lady, her husband was a doctor.
4344360	4348120	He recommended a hospital visit and it turned out that the
4348120	4355080	opponent had a 99% blockage close to his heart and actually
4355080	4359400	on a 2012 episode of the doctors, they got to meet in person.
4361400	4361900	Wild.
4362760	4367240	Yeah, but at any rate, they did do a board game version.
4368600	4370440	That's the part that blows my mind.
4370440	4371080	I know, right?
4371080	4373080	It was a board game called something else.
4373880	4376840	Yeah, but they had like a luxe version with the rotating
4376840	4382040	tile game board and a travel to go edition and the all kinds
4382040	4382540	of shit.
4383640	4387000	I was looking at the video for it rather incredulously.
4389000	4392280	And actually, this isn't the only game that Zynga has done
4392280	4393240	physical versions of.
4393240	4398120	There's Draw Something, Cityville edition of Monopoly and some
4398120	4399880	kids games based on Farmville.
4400680	4409960	In 2019, there was a hack of Zynga that compromised details
4409960	4415960	of 218 million words with friends accounts, including names,
4415960	4420280	email addresses, login IDs, hashed passwords, password reset
4420280	4424280	tokens, phone numbers, Facebook IDs, and Zynga IDs.
4425320	4429560	So hopefully they were able to get some of that resolved.
4430280	4433880	But yeah, that's it.
4435240	4437560	All right, words with fiends.
4437560	4440760	And I'm seeing mostly the comments in chat are kind of talking
4440760	4444520	about like, I can't believe that this game is 10 years old.
4444520	4448360	Like, because, you know, as a reminder for the new fans of
4448360	4450760	Orange Lawns Radio out there, we might have a new listener
4450760	4451400	or two every week.
4452440	4454840	In order for a game to qualify as a classic game of the week,
4454840	4458360	it has to be at least 10 years older or more, which is funny
4458360	4461560	because this show's been on coming up on 21 years.
4461560	4464280	So all of the time now in this segment, we're getting games
4464280	4466440	where it's like, we literally talked about this game when
4466440	4467240	it first came out.
4467240	4468760	And now it's a classic game of the week.
4468760	4470920	And I think there's people in chat very much feeling that
4470920	4471420	this week.
4474280	4480920	Well, and also just to say, I mean, the game had like a
4480920	4482120	rather large impact.
4482120	4483880	I mean, that's the other reason I brought it up.
4483880	4484440	Oh, no.
4484440	4485480	Yeah, mobile games.
4485480	4487560	This is the one everyone was playing.
4487560	4489800	Well, yeah, it's just earlier in the show, and I was talking
4489800	4491160	about NBA All World.
4491160	4493720	When I was talking about NBA All World, I was saying, you
4493720	4497800	know, games that work very well from the cell phone are games
4497800	4501320	that are designed with that cell phone environment and what
4501320	4503000	your phone can and can't do in mind.
4503000	4505480	And ironically, and I didn't even realize this.
4505480	4507400	I mean, I knew what you picked earlier in the day, but I
4507400	4509320	didn't realize when I was saying those comments is that
4509320	4510680	this actually really plays right into that.
4510680	4513240	Words with Friends is a great example of really one of the,
4513240	4515560	I don't want to say one of the earliest, let's put it that
4515560	4518200	way, mobile games that really did that.
4518200	4522120	It did something on your mobile device, whether it's an iPad,
4522120	4524360	iPhone, Android, you name it.
4524360	4528120	It did it on that device that like a port of Sonic the
4528120	4530040	Hedgehog doesn't do the same way.
4530600	4533720	It made a uniquely mobile experience.
4533720	4537400	Well, yeah, this is the kind of game that lends itself very
4537400	4544600	well to a touch experience, which I mean, for me, like I
4544600	4546200	said, it was always the Solitaire mode.
4546200	4548040	That was my favorite thing.
4548040	4551800	And it was actually Words with Friends 2 that had that sort
4551800	4557160	of linked circle mode, the kind of like a crossword-ish sort
4557160	4560280	of thing, but you had to move the letters to unscrabble them
4560280	4562760	and make the words with the given letters.
4565240	4569800	That led me to Wordscapes, which I'm still pretty addicted to.
4569800	4572120	I don't even know what level I am on that thing anymore.
4572920	4575960	But in the tens of thousands, I'll put it that way.
4576760	4579720	I can't see in chat says up there with Farmville and Wordle.
4579720	4580840	I mean, honestly, yeah.
4580840	4582440	My mother did Farmville.
4582440	4584200	I was like, no.
4584200	4585400	And that's exactly it.
4585400	4587480	Words with Friends is one of those games where it's like,
4587480	4591400	you could play that with a grandparent, depending on your
4591400	4592440	family makeup or what have you.
4592440	4593880	But if they made Wordle with Friends.
4594840	4597720	I'm sure someone's already trying to jump on that idea if
4597720	4598760	they haven't already.
4598760	4600840	But my point still stands.
4600840	4603640	This also was a hugely important game because for many
4603640	4606520	people, it was the first game that they were playing with
4606520	4611640	somebody a generation or two older than them that maybe
4611640	4614120	otherwise wasn't playing a lot of games, wasn't interested
4614120	4617320	in playing Sonic, Mario Kart, whatever it is.
4617320	4620680	But will Grandma, Grandpa play Word with Friends?
4620680	4621000	Yeah.
4621720	4624600	So that's been a hugely transformative thing for some
4624600	4624920	people.
4625480	4631000	So and I look at it as sort of a return to the simplicity
4631000	4632040	of retro games.
4633320	4635880	You know, our retro games, they may have been kind of
4635880	4638920	difficult to play, but they were relatively simple to play.
4639880	4643480	And games like this, you know, Farmville thing, whatever,
4643480	4646120	they're all fairly simplistic in a similar way.
4647000	4651000	And something that would be really easy for someone to
4651960	4653480	lose track of time.
4653480	4657000	Or it would play into that addictive personality who like,
4657000	4660200	no, I need to buy this thing in here so I can do this other
4660200	4661800	thing in the game and be better at it.
4662600	4663560	It doesn't make you better at it.
4664200	4666200	But that was my thought.
4666200	4670200	So let's see going other in chat.
4670200	4672040	I know you acknowledge this in chat, but I want to say this
4672040	4673320	for the sake of the podcast listeners.
4673320	4676280	DJ Roma S said, thanks to your classic game last week.
4676280	4680840	I went and bought Star Ocean R for Switch.
4681720	4684280	That's another impact the classic game segment has sometimes
4684280	4686760	is like, hey, sometimes it makes you miss a game and you
4686760	4687560	want to go check it out.
4687560	4690120	So your impact, Dark Soccer, your impact.
4690920	4692200	I'm very impactful.
4693880	4695400	Well, I did actually.
4695400	4697960	I'm getting back to putting like my just a couple of
4697960	4699400	screenshots from my retro stream.
4699400	4705000	So I did put up a couple of really nice pictures from playing
4705000	4706120	Star Ocean last night.
4706120	4710120	Sgio100Matt says, true story, though.
4710120	4713000	My fiancé said that one of the things that attracted her
4713000	4715960	to me initially was when I beat her the one time in Words
4715960	4717800	with Friends when we started dating.
4717800	4718280	That's cute.
4719240	4721240	Well, I told you what happened when I moved out here.
4721240	4724040	Dan said I had to play through Strider and Castlevania
4724040	4724840	Symphony of the Night.
4724840	4725720	And I did.
4725720	4726760	And I beat Strider.
4729240	4732040	Yeah, video games are great for bringing people together.
4732040	4735560	Alan and I, we were long distance dating, but we were like
4735560	4738280	medium distance dating, which means he lived in South
4738280	4739080	San Francisco.
4739080	4740840	I lived here in Sacramento, which, you know.
4742040	4742520	Yeah, exactly.
4742520	4744200	Which if you're not from here, that's like a two and a
4744200	4747720	half hour drive on a good night, maybe three and a half
4747720	4749560	if one of the bridges is fucked.
4749560	4752680	But, you know, I would go see him on the weekend.
4752680	4755960	But during the week we would play World of Warcraft together
4755960	4758520	and it was a way and we could actually quest together.
4758520	4761080	So it's like we could hang out together in a virtual.
4761080	4761960	Isn't that cute?
4761960	4763640	It's all playing well together.
4763720	4767720	I mean, I don't miss well, but I miss us all playing the
4767720	4768680	same game together.
4768680	4769400	Yeah, I hear that.
4769960	4772440	Yeah, that's what makes it by daylight fun when it works
4772440	4774680	out that, you know, we all hop on that for, you know, a
4774680	4775000	night.
4775000	4776760	I'm planning on doing killer tonight.
4776760	4779400	Oh, people convince me otherwise.
4779400	4780280	All right, we'll see.
4780280	4782920	I may be around, but I actually have to work tomorrow.
4784280	4786360	Man, these three day weekends spoil me.
4786360	4786920	All right.
4786920	4789080	This is actually officially starting my work week.
4789080	4791560	So my days off for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
4791560	4793080	Ah, gotcha.
4793080	4793640	Yeah.
4793640	4793960	All right.
4793960	4796920	Well, let's get into some other news headlines.
4796920	4799080	I mentioned there's not a whole lot going on in the gaming
4799080	4800760	world this week, especially compared to other weeks.
4800760	4803400	But we do have a few quick rapid fire headlines to talk
4803400	4803640	about.
4803640	4804920	So let's go to Loki first.
4805640	4807880	Yeah, since we've been talking about Ubisoft and all the
4807880	4810120	games are canceling, let's talk about some of the games
4810120	4813720	that they're reportedly working on, or at least rumors
4813720	4814440	are working on.
4815480	4820440	One of those being some new games in the Far Cry franchise,
4820440	4826440	including a mainline Far Cry 7 and also a multiplayer Far
4826440	4830200	Cry game, live service game or something like that.
4832840	4835320	Of course, they're not going to comment on rumor and
4835320	4841560	speculation, so I guess we'll wait until we find out what's
4841560	4842520	going to be coming out.
4842520	4844440	All right, cool.
4846600	4848920	One of the rumors of part of that, though, actually was
4848920	4851720	that it is going to be using the same engine, apparently,
4851720	4854760	as their open world Star Wars game, which I forgot that
4854760	4856040	they have a Star Wars game.
4856040	4859240	So because you're not going to see it for years and years
4859240	4861720	longer still, probably, I guess.
4861720	4861960	Yeah.
4863800	4868040	Then we've got some TV news, including that Phoebe Waller
4868040	4873640	Bridge is set to be producing a Tomb Raider TV series for
4873640	4878600	Amazon. So that'll be interesting if that ends up happening.
4879400	4881160	And then I just real quick.
4881160	4884760	A Tomb Raider TV series is fascinating to me, and I wonder
4884760	4887800	if it would be a serial, like if it would be the Adventure
4887800	4889160	of the Week type of drama.
4889160	4891800	Like, what was that show called?
4891800	4893400	Relic Hunter or so it was one of those.
4893400	4896440	It was like really bad over the top, like Xeno Warrior Princess
4896440	4898600	Hercules. It was called Relic Hunter or something.
4898600	4900440	Somebody in chat might know what I'm talking about.
4900440	4902280	I wonder if that's where they're going to go a Tomb Raider.
4903560	4904040	Please go.
4904680	4906440	Please bring back Xeno Warrior Princess.
4906440	4908120	That's basically what I'm saying.
4909880	4910440	Basically.
4912280	4912520	Yeah.
4912520	4913640	I don't know if it's going to be bad.
4913640	4914360	Oh, my God.
4914360	4916200	Rama. Rama and I on the same wavelength.
4916200	4916680	That is it.
4916680	4916920	Yep.
4916920	4918040	We already had a Tomb Raider series.
4918040	4919880	It's called Relic Hunter with Tia Carrere.
4919880	4920440	That was it.
4920440	4921640	It was Tia Carrere's show.
4922200	4922600	Fuck.
4922600	4923400	She was amazing.
4924120	4927080	She's not dead, but we don't see her in a lot of stuff
4927080	4927640	anymore.
4927640	4928360	Tia Carrere.
4930120	4930520	That's it.
4930520	4931240	That's the tweet.
4931240	4931800	Tia Carrere.
4932920	4933320	All right.
4934680	4938440	And then not surprisingly, especially after the great
4938520	4942520	reception that the show's gotten already, Last of Us has
4942520	4944360	been renewed for a second season.
4945800	4946200	Shocking.
4946200	4946920	No words.
4946920	4947160	Yeah.
4947800	4949560	Nobody's surprised by that.
4949560	4951000	Well, trailer.
4951000	4953640	If it was on Netflix, it would have been canceled already.
4953640	4958360	I guess shocking that, hey, we're actually having some
4958360	4960680	video game media that sticks around these days.
4960680	4961640	Not all of it does.
4961640	4963560	Hello, Resident Evil, speaking of Netflix.
4963560	4966600	But to be fair, Castlevania, the anime did very well on
4966600	4967240	Netflix.
4967240	4970840	So there's some video game media that's doing all right.
4970840	4972200	So congrats to Last of Us.
4972200	4975240	And to be fair, I heard that Resident Evil show was not
4975240	4975880	good either.
4975880	4979080	So I guess that's fine.
4979080	4980200	You win some, you lose some.
4981000	4981400	Yeah.
4981400	4981960	All right.
4981960	4982440	Moving on.
4982440	4983080	Dark Sakura.
4988920	4993960	So wait, is this really mine?
4994760	4995880	Yeah, I think it's okay.
4995880	4996360	Yeah.
4996360	4999160	I don't follow these, so I was surprised.
5000040	5005160	There's going to be another Splatfest the weekend of
5005160	5006360	February 11th.
5007560	5011080	It's going to ask if you like dark chocolate, milk chocolate,
5011080	5012360	or white chocolate.
5012360	5014520	White chocolate isn't chocolate, so they're going to lose.
5017000	5021960	That's why I thought you would be good for this one, because
5021960	5024840	I knew you would have something to say on the debate itself.
5027160	5029400	White chocolate is like the mayo of chocolate.
5030200	5033400	No, white chocolate is literally milk fat from making chocolate.
5033400	5036200	It is the refuse in chocolate making.
5037560	5038520	Alan hates it, too.
5038520	5040920	I don't mind it, but I would absolutely be team milk chocolate
5040920	5041640	in this fight.
5041640	5042200	No question.
5043160	5046200	The purpose of white chocolate is a flavoring vehicle for
5046200	5049400	other flavors, perhaps, like in my Kit Kats.
5050360	5052600	Other than that, it is not chocolate.
5052600	5054280	It is a vehicle and refuse.
5054920	5058360	Or if for some reason you wanted to dye your chocolate a
5058360	5062280	color that is not brown, perhaps white chocolate would be
5062280	5063960	helpful. That's about it.
5068040	5071080	No, because it would still be that fake white chocolate
5071800	5072680	sugar fat flavor.
5073560	5078120	Anyway, so yeah, this is starting on February 11th and
5078120	5080040	going on through February 13th.
5080040	5082600	So go team dark chocolate.
5083560	5086520	Dark Tetsuya and Orange Rite are with you on team dark chocolate.
5087080	5089400	Orange Rite says white chocolate will be the paper of
5089400	5089880	this one.
5090520	5095720	I can't see suggests Oreos, Hershey's Hugs and Bark for, I
5095720	5096920	guess, white chocolate.
5096920	5100680	So yeah, white chocolate is never eaten alone.
5100680	5104840	It's always like dark soccer said, it's a vehicle for
5104840	5106040	something yummier.
5107640	5108140	All right.
5108860	5114060	Moving on, one other rapid storyline here is about Arcade
5114060	5115420	OneUps latest announcement.
5115420	5118460	They have announced a new Star Wars cabinet, but I was like,
5118460	5119020	wait a minute.
5119020	5120940	They've already released a Star Wars cabinet.
5120940	5122060	Indeed, they have.
5122060	5124540	So that's why I put this one in rapid fire news, because all
5124540	5127020	this is it's a 40th anniversary cabinet.
5127020	5128060	It's going to be $600.
5128780	5132060	It does have the newer look to it where you actually have the
5132060	5133740	coin door look on the front.
5133740	5136860	Like, for instance, a lot of the quote unquote older machines,
5136860	5139420	which, like, Tron is only a year old, but now they're changing
5139420	5142620	this front panel to look like a fake coin door.
5142620	5144780	So the new Star Wars machines are going to have that coin
5144780	5147340	door look on it in part.
5147340	5150780	Unfortunately, I don't hear that it has any new games in it.
5150780	5152300	It's still just the same three games.
5152300	5155340	But of course, what other games can you put in a full size
5155340	5156220	cabinet or something?
5157340	5159900	It is full cup.
5159900	5161180	No, because it has a riser.
5161180	5163100	So it's not a full size machine.
5163100	5166300	Yeah, but it does have that same flight yoke.
5166300	5168220	I don't know if maybe they made improvements to the yoke,
5168220	5170700	because I know some people are not fans of that.
5170700	5172540	So there's that.
5172540	5174620	So if you want to pick up one of those, you can at the Arcade
5174620	5179020	OneUp website, but I'm thinking a lot of folks that were
5179020	5181900	interested in the Star Wars cab probably already picked it
5181900	5185260	up. But if you really want the new artwork, there you go.
5187580	5190780	All right, let's get back into just another couple quick
5190780	5191660	headlines.
5191660	5193820	We're going to open it up pretty soon to your phone calls
5193820	5194620	and feedback.
5194620	5197020	If you want to give us a call live, you can head on over
5197020	5200860	to our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
5200860	5204540	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord and join the green room.
5204540	5207260	And that's where we'll be looking for any potential callers
5207260	5212060	tonight. Meanwhile, let's get to some world release.
5212060	5213820	I'm sorry, we didn't cover release dates yet.
5213820	5214860	We should probably do that.
5214860	5216620	And then we'll get into a couple last headlines here.
5216620	5217740	So let's do release dates first.
5217740	5219020	Loki in the US.
5219020	5219660	All right.
5219660	5224060	So in the US, we have backfire wall on PC, PlayStation 4,
5224060	5227100	PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
5227900	5230460	Trek the Yomi on Nintendo Switch.
5230460	5232380	8-bit adventures on PC.
5233100	5237340	Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition on Xbox One and Xbox
5237340	5237740	Series.
5238300	5240300	Powerwashing Simulator.
5240300	5241980	I guess it's Powerwash Simulator.
5241980	5245500	That's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5245500	5248620	Also that wonderful Tomb Raider DLC coming out this week
5248620	5248940	as well.
5248940	5249820	Can't wait to play that.
5250780	5258220	We have Raiden 4 Cross Mikado Remix on whatever Raiden,
5258220	5259980	Raiden, tomato, tomato.
5260620	5261500	No, it's Raiden.
5262780	5263260	Fine.
5263260	5264060	It's Raiden.
5265980	5269100	That is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
5269100	5270780	Xbox One and Xbox Series.
5271420	5275500	SpongeBob SquarePants and the Cosmic Shake on the PC,
5275500	5278860	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5279420	5282780	And We Were Here Forever, the DMV simulator.
5282780	5285580	No, I don't know what that is, but it's a puzzle adventure
5285580	5289180	game that's on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and
5289180	5290060	Xbox Series.
5291500	5292940	And oh, a couple more.
5292940	5295420	Actually, I was really close to importing that game for
5295420	5298300	the record, except it's Raiden 3, which is like the weakest
5298300	5299420	one in the series.
5299420	5301180	But the music is amazing.
5301180	5302300	Oh, this one says it's four.
5303340	5304140	I said it was four.
5304780	5307740	The Playasia one said Raiden 3.
5307740	5308940	I'll have to double check it.
5308940	5311020	Yeah, it's four.
5311020	5311740	Yeah, it looks like.
5312860	5316700	And then we've got Football Manager 2023 on PlayStation 5,
5316700	5320700	Rhythm Sprout on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
5320700	5325660	PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Chef Life, a restaurant
5325660	5329420	simulator on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation
5329420	5331420	5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5332060	5337660	Deliver Us Mars on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
5337660	5339180	One, Xbox Series.
5339180	5341980	Fashion Police Squad getting its console release on
5341980	5345900	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and
5345900	5346860	Xbox Series.
5347660	5350220	Life is Strange 2 on Nintendo Switch.
5350860	5354460	Puzzle Bubbles slash Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition and
5354460	5360780	Puzzle Bubble 3 and slash Bust-A-Move 3 S Tribute on PC,
5360780	5363500	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5364780	5371420	We have Helvelti on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
5372060	5375980	Joe Wander and the Enigmatic Adventures on PC, PlayStation
5375980	5378140	5 and Xbox Series.
5378140	5378780	And that is it.
5379820	5380140	All right.
5380140	5383420	Well, Japan's release calendar is looking a little smaller.
5383500	5386300	If we go over to Japan and check out the Nintendo Switch,
5386300	5388860	there's some accessories, but they're all third party.
5388860	5391180	Like if you really want a Doraemon pouch for your Switch,
5391180	5392860	cool, you can get that this week.
5392860	5395260	But as far as games go, there's just one for the Switch this
5395260	5396460	week on February 2nd.
5396460	5398700	Life in Willowdale Farm Adventures.
5398700	5401580	And that's a multilingual release that's coming out.
5401580	5403580	There's also a Doraemon wireless controller.
5403580	5405580	Again, as long as we're talking about third party shit.
5405580	5408060	But I seem to recall that there was a Doraemon game in last
5408060	5408860	week's releases.
5408860	5410780	So I mean, this is pretty well timed, I suppose.
5411100	5414220	Flying over to the PlayStation 5, guess what?
5414220	5417900	Nothing until the Wizard game comes out on February 7th
5417900	5420780	in Japan, because I believe that is a worldwide release with
5420780	5421500	everything else.
5422060	5427420	Otherwise, yeah, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.
5427420	5428700	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5432060	5432860	I think you're muted.
5432860	5434700	A hard mute on Discord because I see the icon.
5436540	5439100	Well, it's not even a worthwhile game to talk about.
5439100	5443740	It's a SpongeBob SquarePants cosmic shake on the 31st.
5443740	5446540	Hey, I love SpongeBob, but I don't play the games.
5446540	5449420	Also, for the record, for a certain game that is coming out
5449420	5451820	in February, I'm not going to mention it at all.
5453820	5456300	All right, moving on.
5456300	5458700	Let's get into a couple of quick headlines, and then we're
5458700	5460700	going to wrap it all up here.
5460700	5461660	See if there's some phone calls.
5462620	5463420	Let's go to Loki.
5463740	5469260	Yeah, so a judge has blocked Microsoft's request to pause
5469260	5476620	a lawsuit brought by the Alito law firm and Joseph
5476620	5479900	Saveri law firm on behalf of their plaintiffs, which are
5479900	5485340	some gamers, I guess, who were basically trying to block
5485340	5490060	the whole acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft,
5490060	5491900	saying that it's anti-competitive.
5493820	5497420	So I guess this is going to be going forward on top of all
5497420	5500140	of the other stuff that they're facing with the antitrust
5500140	5503820	things. I don't see where individual gamers really get to
5503820	5508220	have a say in which acquisitions happen or not, but okay.
5509100	5510220	I guess we'll see what happens.
5513900	5515500	Just another day in the courtroom, right?
5516380	5518860	It just seems like it's a bit ridiculous.
5518940	5525900	You would think that, I get where they're saying
5525900	5531580	anti-competitive and stuff, but at the same time, how do
5531580	5533740	you really prove damages from that?
5535820	5538540	It just doesn't make any sense how you can say, oh, well,
5538540	5540620	this is going to harm me specifically.
5540620	5541580	It's like, well.
5541580	5543660	Well, and it's also just really reductive with what the
5543660	5546540	antitrust process is supposed to do anyway.
5546540	5549420	So it's basically a bunch of gamers saying, we don't trust
5549420	5550940	the government to do anything about it.
5550940	5552700	So we're taking matters into our own hands.
5552700	5555340	And then essentially a different branch of the government
5555340	5559820	judicial is stepping in and saying, no, that's basically
5559820	5559980	what it is.
5559980	5563500	In this case, they're saying yes, because they're letting
5563500	5564140	it go forward.
5564140	5565500	They're blocking Microsoft.
5565500	5565660	Okay.
5568300	5570060	So let the circus begin, I guess.
5571100	5573660	I don't see how it goes anywhere.
5573660	5575660	Again, this is what the antitrust process is supposed to
5575660	5576940	do. This is silly.
5577980	5578620	It's dumb.
5578620	5578860	Yeah.
5580700	5581500	Last story tonight.
5581500	5582060	Dark Sakura.
5583820	5592700	So there is a streamer in Japan known as Mote Kimaru, who
5592700	5597100	basically has tetra fish that play video games, like a lot
5597100	5604140	of Pokemon, for example, using motion sensor and like a
5604140	5604860	motion board.
5606860	5610060	Well, and that by itself is actually kind of cool.
5610060	5612860	And his fish are pretty good at it, apparently.
5613420	5616540	But at one time while he was live streaming Pokemon, he had
5616540	5618860	stepped away for a break and the game had crashed.
5619420	5623020	And then it went back to the home screen like it does.
5623020	5627100	And the fish kept on swimming because fish swim.
5628300	5632940	And then during the next seven hours, the fish managed to
5632940	5636540	change the name of the Switch account twice, logged into
5636540	5637660	the Nintendo store.
5638380	5641100	They checked legal terms and conditions, downloaded a new
5641100	5645100	avatar, set up a PayPal account, sent an email to confirm
5645660	5650220	and a video on the live stream actually showed this.
5651660	5657500	And they were also seen adding 500 yen to Mote Kimaru's
5657500	5660460	Switch account from his credit card.
5660460	5662460	And it also exposes credit card details.
5663180	5671500	Um, and so at this point, you know, people were just all
5671500	5672780	on about it.
5672780	5676940	And he said that that afterwards he's contacted Nintendo
5676940	5681180	to to see what happened and ask for a refund of his, you
5681180	5684060	know, four bucks, 500 yen.
5684060	5685820	Is this the plot of Sharknado 6?
5686380	5688140	Like Sharknado shopping spree at the mall?
5689180	5689980	Tetranado.
5690780	5691260	There you go.
5691900	5692620	Tetranado.
5693420	5695980	And Nintendo, of course, hasn't said anything, but I mean,
5695980	5697580	this went to CNN.
5697580	5703980	So I mean, it's it's oddly enough.
5703980	5706620	And I mean, and it literally I'm looking at this screenshot
5706620	5710860	from from his Twitch and it's it's.
5711900	5712400	Yeah.
5713340	5713840	Wow.
5716620	5719740	Oboe 47 in chat says it wasn't a new release of Skyrim.
5720380	5722620	No, I mean, the fish probably could have bought
5722620	5724940	that on the Switch through the store place.
5724940	5728940	I mean, it would have had to have been just a perfect swim
5728940	5736940	storm, a perfect a perfect current to get that series of
5736940	5737820	events to happen.
5737820	5740860	At least he has a video proof that he had nothing to do
5740860	5741360	with it.
5742060	5744860	Or as you might say, fish roe duh.
5747580	5749340	Fish roe duh.
5750860	5751340	Huh?
5751340	5752380	It's the Elder Scrolls joke.
5752380	5753100	Forget it.
5753100	5753600	All right.
5754060	5755260	Yeah, I don't like Elder Scrolls.
5756700	5757900	I don't get it at all.
5757900	5758620	Sorry.
5758620	5760140	Just look in chat.
5760140	5761340	Everybody's booing me.
5761340	5761840	All right.
5762460	5762960	Sorry.
5763660	5765980	The spirit of Drewnami had possessed me for a moment.
5766620	5767120	All right.
5768460	5770940	Let's get to the listener roundtable where we invite you
5770940	5772700	all to participate along with the show.
5773260	5775340	If you have questions for us, obviously, we have a little
5775340	5776140	extra time tonight.
5776140	5778220	I'm happy to take questions in our chat over at
5778220	5780540	twitch.tv slash vog network.
5781180	5783900	We also at this point of the show usually look for any
5783900	5788700	emails. I feel like it's been dry January in our inbox, but
5788700	5789580	I didn't even check.
5789580	5791260	That's how much I forgot about it.
5791260	5792700	I don't think anything's there.
5792700	5793580	Go ahead and look again.
5793580	5797020	But again, if you want to send us an email, participate.
5797820	5798940	Do I need to spell it for you?
5798940	5802700	Participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send
5802700	5803180	your email.
5803180	5806060	At this point, I want someone to send me an email just to
5806060	5806860	make sure it works.
5807420	5810860	We got something about the audio fiction world cup.
5810860	5812380	It's junk.
5812380	5815260	Unfortunately, the spammers have our new address now.
5816860	5818380	We've hardly gotten any spam.
5818380	5818540	Yeah.
5818540	5819660	Not compared to the old box.
5819660	5821020	The old mailbox was way worse.
5821020	5823660	I'm pretty sure somebody hate signed us up for a bunch of
5823660	5825980	stuff because we dare to be people with a podcast when
5825980	5827660	podcast was new.
5827660	5829900	So because we're better than everybody, what are you talking
5829900	5831900	about? And so humble.
5833100	5833500	Let's see.
5834220	5836060	Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories.
5836060	5837340	It's been a heck of a slow news week.
5837340	5839340	I think we covered just about everything, but I will check
5839340	5842060	anyway. How hell we had breaking news earlier in the show.
5842860	5843900	I don't think so.
5845340	5846540	I didn't see anything.
5846540	5848620	I mean, it's not really much of a story.
5848620	5851260	There was a 30 second clip.
5851260	5855980	I guess it's a TV spot or something showing a little bit
5855980	5860220	more of the scene in the Mario movie with Donkey Kong and
5860220	5864300	Mario and shocker Donkey Kong, voiced by Seth Rogan.
5865180	5866300	Sounds like Seth Rogan.
5867340	5872220	You don't say he did not put on a monkey accent.
5873100	5878860	So yeah, it's very disappointing that it's very not authentic
5878860	5882300	to the voice of Donkey calling that we've grown to know and
5882300	5885580	love all of the dialogue that Donkey Kong is bless us with
5886380	5888780	in the myriad of games that he's been out in.
5889420	5894140	Are you saying that they're setting up for a sequel from
5894140	5895420	based on a 30 second clip?
5896860	5898380	They show cat Mario.
5898380	5899900	I mean, that's kind of funny.
5899900	5901420	I mean, the Mario movie looks cute.
5902460	5904060	I got to go see it.
5904060	5904700	I mean, yeah.
5906060	5908940	She hold 10 and chat says, is Loki going to play the new
5908940	5910700	Golden Eye game pass update?
5910700	5912620	You know, Golden Eye 007.
5912620	5912940	What?
5912940	5915180	Honestly, it's a miracle that that game came out.
5915180	5917260	When you consider all the licensing that went into it.
5917260	5920540	It was a Nintendo 64 game made by a now owned by Microsoft
5920540	5925660	company, Rare, with celebrity likeness of Pierce Brosnan,
5925660	5928780	with a property that belongs to the Bond estate.
5928780	5931660	Like, do you know how many people had to sign off on this
5931660	5932940	game getting released?
5932940	5934940	So now it's here.
5934940	5938140	And I mean, has it?
5938140	5939180	Loki, did you check it out yet?
5939180	5941420	It's on my to do list, but I didn't get to it this week.
5941420	5943340	I don't really have any nostalgia for it.
5943340	5945820	I've played it a little bit with friends long time ago,
5945820	5948300	back in the Nintendo 64, but I don't really have any
5948300	5949260	nostalgia for it.
5949260	5954300	So I hear that the controls on the Switch aren't great.
5955420	5957180	You need to change those.
5957180	5960620	But the Xbox couldn't be good.
5960620	5961740	Like the old one did.
5964380	5968300	I wonder if it plays at a higher frame rate or what happens
5968300	5970860	now. I want to check it out out of morbid curiosity, but
5970860	5973020	I'm kind of in the boat with Loki to be honest.
5973020	5975660	I don't have the same emotional attachment to Golden
5976460	5979980	like most of you do, because when that game came out, if I
5979980	5983180	was playing a Nintendo 64, I tell you it was Mario Kart,
5983180	5986540	Mario Kart 64 and nothing but like, that was the only game
5986540	5989980	we ever played in the college dorm on Nintendo 64.
5989980	5992620	Hell, even my Super Nintendo and the old school Mario Kart
5992620	5993980	was played.
5993980	5997740	But as far as shooters go, we were playing Duke Nukem at
5997740	5999820	that time, because that was right around the same time when
5999820	6004620	Duke Nukem was on PC, and we were able to play because the
6004620	6006140	old computers had the modems.
6006140	6008300	And so I could call my neighbor in the dorm.
6008300	6012620	It was just before like wired internet and dorms became big,
6012620	6013820	but you would call through the phone light.
6013820	6016460	We would play Duke Nukem across the phone.
6016460	6018860	And so we kind of did that instead of Goldeneye.
6018860	6023100	So when I was in college, it was just Doom.
6024220	6025820	Yeah, Doom, Doom as well.
6025820	6028620	I was going to say Doom 2, but I meant Doom also, but
6028620	6029420	sometimes Doom 2.
6029420	6031260	No, for us, it was Doom.
6031260	6033180	I think when did Doom 2 come out?
6033180	6033980	I have to remember.
6034780	6041260	But OK, why is it not giving me the right date for Doom 2?
6041820	6042620	OK, actually, no.
6042620	6046540	Yeah, we were doing Doom 2 because that was 1994.
6046540	6049100	And they weren't that far apart, the first two.
6049100	6049740	Yeah.
6049740	6051420	And Hexen was the other thing.
6051420	6055020	But we didn't I didn't get to play Duke Nukem until we had a
6055020	6058940	LAN party at Mobicon in 1996.
6059740	6064780	My friends, my friends at Sonoma State, they got T1 internet,
6064780	6068140	which was like the high speed fucking remember that?
6068140	6071100	That was like if you had T1 internet, you were rich, right?
6071100	6072380	So do you have a T1?
6072380	6072700	Yeah.
6072700	6073820	You have a T3?
6073820	6076620	So they got T1 internet in their dorms.
6076620	6078700	So they started the Quake server.
6078700	6081020	And then that became the game we all played.
6081020	6085100	I would call into their server over the T1 or whatever from
6085100	6087100	my thing, and we would all fucking play the shit out of
6087100	6090300	Quake and like the early Team Fortress mods and those types
6090300	6090800	of things.
6091340	6095580	When we had our Dreamcast in the ethernet adapter, Dan was
6095580	6099980	really into playing Quake on our Dreamcast for a hot minute.
6100540	6101900	Since we couldn't play PSO.
6102620	6103180	So dumb.
6103980	6107820	Like, why would they put out an online game that has the
6107820	6112060	online capability, but disable the thing that makes it go
6112060	6112460	online?
6113340	6115820	DarkTitius says, can we get a Quake night going?
6115820	6117740	I think the remaster has cross play.
6117740	6118460	I'd be in.
6118460	6118940	I play.
6118940	6121420	So me, DarkTitsia, can we get like two other people to do
6121420	6123580	it? Because then I only if we do ASCII Quake.
6124140	6125660	What the fuck is ASCII Quake?
6126460	6127740	It's in Quake.
6127740	6129580	There is a mode to play it in ASCII.
6130140	6130860	Killi.
6130860	6131740	I didn't know that.
6131740	6135180	I don't know if the remake because I believe I have done
6135180	6137420	Quake as a classic game of the month and spoke on this at
6137420	6137740	length.
6137740	6142220	I think somebody was asking me earlier today about something
6142220	6143980	I said last week on this show.
6143980	6145340	And I was like, what was I talking about?
6145340	6145900	I don't remember.
6148300	6149980	I don't remember what we talk about in this program.
6149980	6150540	Are you serious?
6151900	6152860	Yeah, it was actually sorry.
6153420	6157180	Yeah, there was Quake live and then Quake 2 had text mode.
6158860	6161340	I remember the console was built into Quake, but yeah.
6162300	6163420	Yeah, it was.
6163420	6164220	Okay, nevermind.
6164220	6165100	Yeah, it was.
6165100	6165580	It was.
6168380	6169660	I'm sorry, it was a mod.
6169660	6170300	My apologies.
6170300	6170780	It was a mod.
6171420	6175260	So, but yeah, it's also very disorienting, but I played
6175820	6177100	and I'm not fond of it.
6177100	6177660	But Dr.
6177660	6180060	Tua, yes, if we could get the people, I'd so be down for
6180060	6181900	a Quake just for fun.
6181900	6186220	So because the remake is really most people got it for free
6186220	6187980	at some point one way or another.
6188620	6190540	Is it maybe it's still free for all I know.
6190540	6193820	I don't know, but I'm sure it's on game pass if nothing else.
6193820	6195340	So all right.
6196620	6200060	Well, with that in the chat, I did link a video to text
6200060	6200460	Quake.
6201820	6204060	Let me see this, because I'm not sure I've ever actually
6204300	6206620	and we have the time, so I might as well take a look.
6206620	6208060	Oh, God, this looks terrible.
6208060	6212220	But like, doesn't it in one of those, like, I'm gonna actually
6212220	6214140	fast forward a little bit here in the clip so we can actually
6214140	6215900	see this dark soccer.
6215900	6217500	This actually looks worse.
6217500	6222460	And to describe what I'm seeing for the podcast listeners
6222460	6226460	is that it literally is the entire screen is made up of
6226460	6228780	ASCII characters, meaning like, you know, text characters
6228780	6230140	with the keyboard and things like that.
6230140	6232940	If you're not familiar with the term ASCII, but it's like,
6234060	6235180	it's one of those.
6235180	6235500	You know what?
6235500	6237900	It reminds me of, like, those pictures where, like, if you
6237900	6241020	stand way back in the room, then you can tell what it is.
6241020	6242940	But if you're looking close up, you see that.
6242940	6243900	Do you see the sailboat?
6244860	6249020	Not those scooter, but similar.
6249020	6249500	Yes.
6249500	6250780	Similar to that vibe.
6250780	6251280	Yes.
6253340	6256380	How could you possibly play a video game like this?
6256380	6256620	Yeah.
6257340	6258700	I'm getting a headache watching that.
6258700	6259340	Same.
6259340	6260380	Yeah, it is the novelty.
6261180	6261660	All right.
6261660	6263100	I like to play Gatchamon Quake.
6263740	6267900	Well, with that, we are at the end of the program, so I'm
6267900	6269900	going to go around and get everybody's final thought and
6269900	6270460	wrap things up.
6270460	6272700	But I do want to say thank you very much for listening to
6272700	6272940	the show.
6272940	6274940	I know it was a little shorter tonight, but sometimes there
6274940	6276540	just isn't as much gaming news.
6276540	6278460	I hope everybody had a wonderful week.
6278460	6279740	I hope you have a great week ahead.
6279740	6282300	I hope you're enjoying playing things, whether it's new
6282300	6285900	surprise releases like HiFi Rush or, you know, or Forespoken,
6285900	6288700	something you were waiting for, or just the same old shit.
6288700	6291180	If you're still playing Dead by Daylight, that is fine, too,
6291180	6291980	or whatever it is.
6292780	6294700	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio,
6294700	6295900	tell a friend or two about the show.
6295900	6297660	Help us spread the word because we are the show where
6297660	6299980	every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here to
6299980	6300860	put out on air.
6300860	6303500	So a nice five-star review wherever you found this show
6303500	6304620	goes an awful long way.
6304620	6309340	A site like iTunes or Spotify helps an awful lot, and we
6309340	6312060	just appreciate those words, mouths, social media shares.
6312060	6313740	They work great as well.
6315500	6318060	We're at the end, so let me go and get final thoughts for
6318060	6318460	the night.
6318460	6320700	DarkSakra, as usual, I'll start with you because I know
6321340	6324220	you're gonna go play on your own stream after the show
6324220	6328700	tonight. Yeah, I'm gonna get back to trying to
6328700	6332060	adapt my killers and try to remember how to play most of
6332060	6336620	them. I actually even have it as a redeem now that you can
6336620	6337740	force me to play nurse.
6338620	6339500	Oh, wow.
6339500	6340540	Heaven help me.
6340540	6341020	Good luck.
6341020	6344300	Remember, I got my adapt because they gave it to me.
6344300	6347500	I am going to have to play her eventually, but I suck at
6347500	6351500	nurse. I would play blight better than nurse and I suck at
6351500	6352460	blight twins.
6354540	6357340	Actually, I'm kind of okay at twins now, kind of sort of,
6358220	6362700	but I did totally already adapt Pig and Freddie because
6362700	6364460	they are my mains and I did them in one try.
6364460	6365900	So it wasn't a big deal.
6367260	6369260	But yeah, I think I might go back to the adapt thing, but
6369260	6370460	if I get sick of it, who knows?
6370460	6371580	Maybe we'll Swift.
6371580	6374300	All right, well have a great stream and we will talk to you
6374300	6376300	next week in February.
6376300	6377900	I can't believe it's already going to be February.
6378540	6378780	All right.
6378780	6379180	Right.
6379180	6380300	Yeah, exactly.
6381900	6382700	Loki, we'll go to you.
6382700	6383820	What's your final thought tonight?
6384620	6385500	I'm tired.
6385500	6385900	That's it.
6386620	6387580	You're tired.
6387580	6388380	You need a nap.
6388380	6388940	I understand.
6390060	6394620	My final thought is I haven't done personal streaming in
6394620	6396460	a few weeks because again, as I talked about at the top of
6396460	6398300	the show, I've had some personal stuff going on, especially
6398300	6399020	this week.
6399020	6401340	I am looking at trying to pick up some more narrative games,
6401340	6403740	especially now that I've let my wow subscription lapse and
6403740	6406540	my only MMO I'm playing now is Final Fantasy 14.
6406540	6408860	I want to try to really play through some single player games.
6408860	6412620	I definitely want to do the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters,
6412620	6416140	Windows release on Switch, PlayStation, that whole thing.
6416140	6418700	I might close the gap on some Pokemon games.
6418700	6419660	I'm really behind on.
6419660	6422620	I really have an itch to go back and finish Pokemon Arceus,
6422620	6425820	which I know, like, why would I do that when I still need
6425820	6427180	to beat Scarlet and Violet?
6427180	6429100	Because I'm at the point now where I'm like, if they're
6429100	6432300	working on a quality of life update for Scarlet and Violet,
6432300	6434300	then why don't I wait for that update?
6434300	6436700	It's this very weird day and age we live in where it's like,
6436700	6438780	now I know a patch is coming, so I'm going to wait for the
6438780	6440540	patch till I finish the game.
6440540	6442460	It's weird how that goes sometimes.
6442460	6444220	But anyway, that's it for me.
6445180	6446540	We'll see you again in a week.
6446540	6448380	Thank you so much for being here tonight, everyone.
6448380	6449580	I really appreciate it.
6449580	6451740	Have a wonderful week and good night.
