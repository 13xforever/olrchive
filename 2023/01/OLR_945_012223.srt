1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,120
It's the Attack of the Clones!

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,920
No, not the Star Wars prequel, this one was a sequel!

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Wortle Clone Qortle, a quad wortle, four boards at once version was purchased by Merriam Webster.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,520
This is the second wortle-like purchase and it is not known when someone will purchase

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,000
duo trigortle.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,320
This intro is full of words that couldn't be played in a typical wortle or wortle-like

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
game.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:45,160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,760
where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio and we're live once again episode

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,620
number 945 of our show for tonight January 22nd of 2023.

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,720
My name is Rob Roberts I'm joined here live on this Sunday evening as I am most often

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,620
with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
Sup bitches.

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,180
Hi, how are you doing?

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,780
I'm okay I'm tired I stayed up until five in the morning playing Dead by Daylight with

16
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,780
people.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Were you streaming the whole time?

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,780
No.

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,780
Oh no.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,820
Raven I did I started I'll get to it in classic game, but I did my my retro stream and then

21
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:41,420
decided to go play DBD with Raven McPherson, Shayla, and Vant Bunny and and I ate whiskey

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,700
filled chocolate the entire time.

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,620
I was very stupid by the end of it that's the only thing I can say for myself.

24
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,660
I I we were having giggle fits at the end.

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,980
But the best games of Dead by Daylight you played this week were with me earlier this

26
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,720
week even though I completely got you killed in one match because I thought For the People

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,220
would work on a on a course.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,740
And I still am sorry about my reaction I just was so flabbergasted.

29
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,380
I was so flabbergasted by that I'm like no don't touch me stop.

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,580
Yeah and your your mic and I was saying but your mic does this noise gate thing where

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,660
I think sometimes when you're like no no like it actually doesn't come through so I'm like

32
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,860
what's going on I see the icon sometimes sometimes I don't because I think I was trying

33
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,260
to give it to the wrong person.

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,620
So anyway, it was just it was just a comedy of errors at that point.

35
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:38,020
So I actually think that you might have used it on Gwen but that was just like, and I like

36
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,860
I had to step away for a moment to get myself to chill out a little.

37
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,540
I mean, it's fine.

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,780
I mean, in retrospect, it was pretty hilarious.

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,220
Um, but I'll get more into my Dead by Daylight shenanigans because I'm already gold one.

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,820
All right.

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,940
Well, speaking of comedy of errors also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

42
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,700
See, the mic's not muted.

43
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,780
I keep pushing the button and it's like it's like, yes, no, yes, no, yes.

44
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,380
I did not install the switch so you could have a microphone rave.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,180
Anyway, pretty much it will it already blinks when you when you have it on mute.

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,020
So you know, I every week, of course, we tape our show live Sunday nights at the voice of

47
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,300
geeks network twitch.tv slash v o g network Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern six

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,260
o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

49
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,740
Let's be real.

50
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,700
We don't start till about 610 or so because we give Bob we give Bobby his space to finish

51
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,180
the show.

52
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,540
But if you watch us live, you get to see the visuals you get to see us things in our spaces

53
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,100
that we do the show from and Loki oftentimes will have a game playing behind him.

54
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,340
And tonight I noticed Loki has got is that is no B no B boy tonight, right?

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,460
There's no B no B boy.

56
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,540
Yeah, a little bit of a flashback.

57
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,980
And now I guess that game is older than I think it is a little bit of a flashback.

58
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,820
It's the computer when only the phone.

59
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,320
Yeah.

60
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,140
No B no B boy, of course, from the creator of Katamari Damacy in between the whole I'm

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,540
gonna go build kids playground stuff, right.

62
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:17,100
But it it the art style and the look of the game is very similar to Katamari Damacy, obviously,

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,020
in that it's it's a little wild.

64
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,640
But cute.

65
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,060
It's Yeah, it's interesting.

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,820
What a what brought no B no B boy to mind this week.

67
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,740
You're gonna laugh because this is it's really mundane.

68
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,960
Okay.

69
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,940
Let's put away laundry and have a no B no B boy shirt actually have multiple no B no

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,380
B boy shirts.

71
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,340
So I just thought I was like, Oh, yeah, hey, I can do that.

72
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,860
No, that's I think of the Golden Girls often for a similar reason.

73
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,020
So yeah, there you go.

74
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,400
All right.

75
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,060
Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight and get into the stories tonight.

76
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,620
First off, I do want to acknowledge those we are taping live tonight.

77
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,260
What an amazing hype train going on in the chat right now.

78
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,980
That's incredible.

79
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,380
It just I just saw an alert that said we're about to break our record.

80
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,540
And I think with those five gift subs Mike Def just dropped, we just might have broken

81
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,300
our record for hype train.

82
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,780
I don't know how long it's been tracking those trains for.

83
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,340
But you know what?

84
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,860
That's that's here.

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,900
Maybe I don't know.

86
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,620
But you know what?

87
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,580
Thank you.

88
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,540
No, seriously.

89
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,460
That's incredibly generous of all of you.

90
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,060
Huge motivation to be here on Sunday nights and keep doing this for all of you.

91
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,060
Although honestly, I like hanging out with my friends, Matt and Jamie.

92
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,500
And this has been a pretty good excuse to do that for the last 21 years.

93
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,460
So let's get into it.

94
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,260
What do we do here?

95
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,380
We talk about what's going on in the gaming world and gaming news and all of that.

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,060
So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which I wish we had better news tonight.

97
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,220
Unfortunately, this is just probably a symptom of what's going on in the world period, right?

98
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,140
So let me start with actually Dark Sakura tonight with our kickoff topic tonight on

99
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,260
what's going on in the industry.

100
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,740
Shenanigans and bullshit.

101
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Um, it's it's it's consumerism.

102
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,340
It's it's capitalism at work.

103
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,060
So the the tech industry is experiencing a crap load of layoffs.

104
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,580
They are at Microsoft.

105
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:34,060
They're announcing they announced Wednesday plans to cut 10,000 jobs, including 343 Industries,

106
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,140
the coalition, and Bethesda, League of Legends.

107
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,140
Sorry, Riot Games, who does League of Legends, has cut more than 40 jobs.

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,780
Microsoft, I mean, now keep in mind that Microsoft's layoffs are less than 5% of its

109
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,660
total workforce.

110
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,020
But still, I mean, this is this is pretty, that's a lot of people who are going to be

111
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,500
out of work.

112
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,980
And then Google is cutting 12,000 jobs.

113
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:21,340
Their CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that they were hired for a different economic reality

114
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,580
than the one we face today, end quote.

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,540
And of course, this is coming right after the shutdown of Stadia.

116
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,500
Fuck.

117
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,940
Anyway, RIP Stadia.

118
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,020
Unity is eliminating 284 jobs.

119
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,300
They're closing a sports and live entertainment department to end a project that would let

120
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,860
viewers watch sports matches from different angles.

121
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,020
There's Riot Games is laying off 46 people.

122
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,980
It's there.

123
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,900
The analysts are saying there's going to be even more that they're trying to preserve

124
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,820
their profitability in the face of an oncoming recession.

125
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:13,900
But I mean, would it make sense to remove people's sources of income that they could

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,980
be putting back into the economy?

127
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,060
Well, we can't pay these employees if we want our Sting concerts, you know, it's either

128
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,460
Sting or employees and I just like Sting better.

129
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,580
No, they want to the CEO.

130
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,540
I want to see the CEOs take their pay cut to retain employees.

131
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,580
That's what I want to see.

132
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,380
Do you remember when the Wii U had its flop era, which was pretty much the whole time

133
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,180
it was released?

134
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,740
Sorry.

135
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,100
I know some of the games are great, but let's be real, the Wii U for all intents and purposes

136
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,900
was a flop.

137
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,060
Do you remember when Miyamoto took personal responsibility and said, I am cutting my salary

138
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,540
this year?

139
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,220
Miyamoto, that was Iwata.

140
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

141
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,580
Sorry, horrible mistake to make.

142
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:01,740
But it was Iwata that, yes, said I'm going to cut my salary on this whole thing because

143
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,820
of the poor performance of the Wii U, right?

144
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,820
And that's why-

145
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,900
That was an amazing news.

146
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,260
That's why he's respected.

147
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,540
Even Emeritus.

148
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,220
Anyhow, sorry, I just wanted to add that.

149
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:26,540
It's absolutely disgusting that people are more worried about their own pockets than

150
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,460
the longevity of their company and the well-being of their employees, that they could just let

151
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,420
them go like that.

152
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,020
It's absolutely disgusting.

153
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:45,660
Yeah, it's really telling that the senior level executives don't bear the brunt in a

154
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,420
similar proportion when these sorts of things happen.

155
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:55,420
That's the real kind of disgusting and what ought to be frankly illegal part of this.

156
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,260
But what do I know?

157
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,100
But yeah.

158
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,020
But I guess let me ask this question too.

159
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,540
Well, actually, let me go to Loki and see if there's anything you wanted to add on this,

160
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,540
because I know you've been following the story too, Loki.

161
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,620
Well, I remember seeing some stuff where they were cutting departments dedicated to, what

162
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,260
was it, the mixed reality stuff and HoloLens.

163
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,620
So I guess that's a development we're not going to see for a while.

164
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:28,380
And then just different game teams as well, like 343 Industries, which is understandable

165
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,740
because Halo Infinite was kind of rocky.

166
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,100
Well, but then there were those weird rumors about they're not going to do Halo anymore

167
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,900
to which they actually came out on their actual Twitter and said,

168
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,940
we look forward to doing Halo for a long time.

169
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,940
That doesn't mean they won't partner with others or that sort of they can oversee Halo

170
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,460
without doing it themselves.

171
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,940
But any way you slice it, unfortunately, a lot of people that worked on Halo Infinite

172
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,500
are not employed as of this week, which stinks.

173
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,420
Yeah, I don't know if it's because they're trying to grow too fast or something like

174
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,140
that, because, I mean, Microsoft has been doing a lot of acquisitions of different companies.

175
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm sure Google does the same stuff.

176
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,700
I don't know.

177
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,180
I don't understand how CEOs operate.

178
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,500
Some comments from chat.

179
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,100
Sjo and Hunter Matt says these companies knew they were going to do this months ago, but

180
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
they waited until after the holidays to do it.

181
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,020
Like that is supposed to hurt any less.

182
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,180
I mean, at least it was something.

183
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,780
Yeah, it could be worse.

184
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,300
They could do what the guy at Twitter did and do it two weeks before the holidays.

185
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,460
But anyway, whatever.

186
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,060
It's not these people who got laid off fault that these companies grew too quickly and

187
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,500
they didn't forecast or support the people that they rushed to hire.

188
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,420
That is a theme that you see a lot throughout the industry.

189
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,980
But again, whose fault is that at the end of the day?

190
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,300
It's typically leadership.

191
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,260
It's leadership, for sure.

192
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,060
This is a bummer.

193
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,860
So what happens now?

194
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,660
Luckily, one nice thing about the gaming industry is that I've noticed that the game developers

195
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,740
and so forth, they really look out for each other.

196
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,900
That's why also, your reputation is very important.

197
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,180
This is also why you never see game developers talking shit about each other on Twitter or

198
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,300
any type of social media.

199
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,540
You sure do see the players talking shit about them.

200
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,740
And that's why a lot of players don't end up getting into the industry.

201
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,180
All tea, all shade.

202
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:36,140
Is that because when you build out that reputation for yourself or a lot of journalists and podcasters

203
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,020
and yes, I completely am self attacking.

204
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,820
A lot of reasons people like us don't get into the industry is because our reputation

205
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,180
ends up getting ruined because of the stuff we say on social media and things like that.

206
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,220
This is a very small industry and bridges can burn quickly.

207
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,820
That being said, though, I don't want to focus on the negative because for the most part,

208
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,020
people know how to act.

209
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,580
And a lot of the gaming industry really does look out for each other.

210
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,900
And I think oftentimes when we see large gaming studio gets too large and gets bought, then

211
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,180
a spin off studio ends up opening up inevitably, and we'll start to hire and so forth.

212
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,500
So at least the gaming industry is really good about looking out for its people.

213
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,100
It's just very disruptive, obviously, because sometimes that means it's going to be relocation.

214
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,100
Although, you know, in the in this, you know, pandemic, I don't want to say post pandemics

215
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,980
pandemic is not over.

216
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,140
But it's in this people feel over it pandemic world that we're in now, you know, more people

217
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,780
work from home.

218
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,820
So do you need to necessarily be relocating?

219
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,220
I don't know.

220
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,980
I guess that depends on the company you're signing up for.

221
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,020
I'm gonna say something about management in general.

222
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,420
Yeah.

223
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,100
That no matter where the management starts off in the company, eventually they forget.

224
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,260
They become corporate.

225
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,500
And it's it's just something that happens.

226
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,860
I have seen it happen to the nicest people.

227
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,620
It changes who they are, because then the only thing that they are looking at is base

228
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,700
numbers, big picture, high level things.

229
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,780
And forgetting what really makes the company work is what reality is like.

230
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,980
I'm looking at some other comments in chat.

231
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,540
DJ Rama S says a lot of them got severance pay.

232
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,380
It's something at least to be fair, Rama.

233
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,500
Yes, I don't disagree.

234
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,020
But a lot of that's mandated retired, required to Yeah, a lot of that is mandated because

235
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,260
like, for example, I think in Europe, I may be wrong.

236
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,500
And if I'm talking out of my ass, I apologize.

237
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,100
I believe in Europe, it's you have to give 90 days notice that you're going to terminate

238
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,460
somebody's position for a company of a certain size.

239
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,260
The way companies get around that they pay 90 days of severance, because that way they're

240
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,300
basically able to say, Oh, we're laying you off today.

241
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,700
But it's effective as this this date.

242
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,820
And that's what you're getting paid for.

243
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,100
So severance is how they kind of get around some of those laws sometimes.

244
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,660
I realize some companies go above and beyond.

245
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,620
And that is awesome.

246
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,460
But I, I don't want to give the executives too much credit.

247
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,340
It's where I'm going.

248
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,460
No, I know I hear legally severance begins after the last date worked.

249
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,820
So, um, so something like that wouldn't fly.

250
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,060
It's like when you are no longer considered an employee of the company.

251
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,460
That's when you start getting your severance payout.

252
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,960
Yeah.

253
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,020
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they've gotten really good at looking after each other talking

254
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,660
about the folks in the industry, because this happens so often.

255
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,860
They have lots of practice.

256
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,620
We have a saying at my company that the best way to ruin a great developer is to make the

257
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,120
management.

258
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,880
Questbuster says corporations take advantage of feast or famine cycles with ruthless abandon.

259
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Expect them to gorge when things are on fire and watch them amputate what they don't need

260
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
to stop the bleeding.

261
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,880
But the weird the weird thing I mean, I don't disagree with what you're saying Questbuster,

262
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
but the weird thought that it leads me to is that here, I swear we were just sitting

263
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,880
here two weeks ago.

264
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
I mean, I can't believe we're at the end of January.

265
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,880
But I, I feel like we were just sitting here doing our predictions two weeks ago.

266
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,480
And we were looking at, wow, what a big wow, my my my my inner Jennifer Coolidge just came

267
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,980
out.

268
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,480
Wow.

269
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
2023 is going to be a year for the games.

270
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,680
But I mean, really, it's it's there's so many big things coming out this year, right?

271
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,920
There's there's Zelda, right?

272
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,320
There's Final Fantasy 16.

273
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,280
There's a PSVR two, if that's what you're into.

274
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,480
There's potentially maybe a switch rebrand or something.

275
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
And you never know what else the switch is going to be into.

276
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Like, when we're looking at what is slated to come out this year, and yes, I understand.

277
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,480
Things get pushed back on the calendar all the time.

278
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,120
Yes, yes, yes.

279
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,320
But overall, looking at 2023 as a year, it looks like it's going to be a big fucking

280
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,820
year.

281
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,960
Now, I because I already know some of you are thinking it perhaps, okay, those games

282
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,320
are all about to go gold.

283
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
So we're going to lay off this test team.

284
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,440
But I also feel like so many of those games like, I'm sorry, Final Fantasy 16, that's

285
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,280
Final Fantasy 16, not having DLC, especially looking after at looking at 15.

286
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
Yeah, right.

287
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,840
Zelda not having deals.

288
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,120
Like I feel like games are playing the long game.

289
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,200
At this point, you need teams to be around a while.

290
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,000
So it's just but then again, Square and Nintendo, the games I keep referencing are not two of

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,520
the companies that we're talking about right now in regards to layoffs.

292
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,760
So I mean, maybe I'm just applying the wrong things to the situation.

293
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,960
But I still feel like it's a decent year ahead for Microsoft and Game Pass and all

294
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,440
of that.

295
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
It's just a little weird to me.

296
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,620
I don't know.

297
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:43,840
Let's see.

298
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
Looking in chat at some other comments.

299
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
Darted Studio says hell yeah, Zelda clearing off my calendar for that one.

300
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,600
Let's see.

301
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,800
Zen Monkey 11 says that was a great Jennifer Coolidge impression.

302
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,920
Thank you.

303
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,800
You know what?

304
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,300
What?

305
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
I was thinking Charlie the Unicorn.

306
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,680
Oh, Candy Mountain, Charlie.

307
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,720
These gays.

308
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
They're trying to murder me.

309
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,320
Now I want to see her.

310
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
It's a magical Leopleradon.

311
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,680
Now I want to see her as a Twitch streaming playing games.

312
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,240
Actually, Zen Monkey 11 on a completely unrelated note.

313
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
I love Jennifer Coolidge.

314
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,400
And I look anybody like I think any person I was about to say any gay person, any person

315
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,880
period with taste is happy to see all the love that she's getting.

316
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,200
Thanks to things like White Lotus and things that should have been happening when she was

317
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
Stifler's mom like a long time ago.

318
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,440
Right.

319
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,720
And legally blonde and all that when she was playing all the hairdress rules.

320
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
My point with Jennifer Coolidge.

321
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
She just started a TikTok.

322
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,440
So she's inching closer to the streaming thing, but she has an official TikTok now.

323
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,240
So anyway, let's see.

324
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,680
Evil Protagonist says, hopefully Google started with the team that made Stadia.

325
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,280
Here's the thing, Evil Protagonist.

326
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
It's not the fault of many others.

327
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,560
Actually, those people made a good product.

328
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,060
They did.

329
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,360
It's Phil Harris.

330
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,000
Phil Harrison's the one that needs to get laid off because his messaging sucked, you

331
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,760
know, and, you know, I just I don't know.

332
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,040
Like I don't want to take it out on the teams who oftentimes were just doing what they were

333
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,160
told and oftentimes actually have a really good idea.

334
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,400
And it's just poorly fucking supported in marketing.

335
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,400
Food for thought.

336
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,240
Let's see.

337
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,800
Other comments in chat.

338
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,280
Bobby Blackwolf says, but I'm glad that everyone is going to be celebrating the anniversary

339
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,800
of my 29th birthday this year.

340
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,040
I mean, they'll say they're crying for a kingdom.

341
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,840
This is a play on the Zelda game, but I know it's really for my anniversary.

342
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,120
SSJ100Matt says, speaking of White Lotus, I got to see Aubrey Plaza's SNL performance

343
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,600
last night.

344
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800
I heard it was good.

345
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,080
I don't know if Shad Leland's still in chat, but he could tell you all about it and we're

346
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,120
derailing, but I don't care.

347
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,040
So you could watch like all of Saturday Night Live before it even airs on the West Coast

348
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,960
because they put it all on YouTube.

349
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,520
So before it even aired here, I was looking up the Megan 2.0 sketch they did last night

350
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,680
and that was really funny.

351
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,800
Like, it could have been funnier, but some of the jokes that they did, like, they were

352
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,880
they she didn't yet.

353
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,760
Don't spoil it.

354
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,920
Okay, no, I bet they say stop singing this song and play something, play something the

355
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,280
gays can get into or something like that.

356
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,680
And they start playing the theme from White Lotus.

357
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,560
That was the part that made me laugh the loudest because the theme from White Lotus is so,

358
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,800
like, specific.

359
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
It's like a very specific kind of meme.

360
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,760
So and just playing that it's like this is a song the gays get into is absolutely true.

361
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,720
So I just thought that was a very smart joke.

362
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,040
Anyway, Tiger Claw says they already announced a sequel to Megan.

363
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,920
Yes, they did.

364
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,040
They absolutely did.

365
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,320
Speaking, let's derail the train further because I've got to give a shout out to this.

366
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
So Megan drag acts are all the rage right now.

367
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,840
One of my friends is a drag performer and they did a Megan drag act last night, but

368
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,080
they I got to play a victim in their act.

369
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,080
And so, yeah, I got to have my ear removed as part of the act.

370
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,960
So there was there was fake.

371
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,920
My ear was like covered in fake blood when it was all done and all this stuff.

372
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,480
It was.

373
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,000
So I was like, and we were even joking as they were telling me before the show, they

374
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,880
were like, Megan acts.

375
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,560
There's so many on YouTube right now.

376
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,720
And I said, red, red, because drag queen is red for filth, which if look up red for

377
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
filth, they're great name.

378
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,960
Yeah, red.

379
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
I told her I said, Red, you're the only one that's going to have an act with a real

380
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
live victim.

381
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,000
And they were like, Oh, good point.

382
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,360
So I said, you're up in the ante with your act.

383
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
So but it was a lot of fun.

384
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,160
And yes, since I wasn't hosting the show last night, because, you know, I got to share

385
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,560
sometimes there's lots of talented hosts in the area.

386
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,080
I got to participate in the act.

387
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,120
So anyway, just wanted to shout that out there randomly as we're talking about layoffs.

388
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,520
Sorry.

389
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,440
Sorry for the bad news about layoffs, but we could talk about drag queens can always

390
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,160
make you feel better.

391
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,660
Right.

392
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,020
All right.

393
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Let's see other comments in chat.

394
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,640
Yeah.

395
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,320
As Joan Hunter Matt says, can't derail if the train was never on the rails to begin

396
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,640
with.

397
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, that's that's very true.

398
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,400
Train.

399
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,120
That's very true.

400
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,480
All right.

401
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,040
We just have a boat that's kind of trying not to capsize.

402
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,560
Well, in all seriousness, you know, if you were somebody that was affected by the layoffs,

403
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm very sorry to hear it.

404
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,280
And, you know, refer back to what I said earlier, the industry is very good at taking care of

405
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,760
its own.

406
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,120
So, you know, don't be afraid to ask for help.

407
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,000
If you are a social media user, you know, I'm not usually one to sit here to talk good

408
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,640
about Twitter.

409
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,600
But I completely understand people are there.

410
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
Doing a shout out on a platform like that might help you find something.

411
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,320
I personally have had a lot of luck over the years of LinkedIn.

412
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm not in the gaming industry.

413
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm in a different industry, but LinkedIn has been great for networking, connecting,

414
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,440
and finding positions.

415
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
And, heck, Mastodon, a lot of people have been moving over there.

416
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,120
A lot of good stuff there, too.

417
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,040
And plenty more.

418
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,240
So, you know, use that social networking.

419
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,240
Yeah, use that social networking.

420
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,680
And just don't be afraid to say, hey, this news sucks.

421
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,640
Can anyone help me?

422
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,680
Because you never know who is out there that might have a good lead for you.

423
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,680
So, all right.

424
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,040
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing

425
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,680
this week.

426
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,200
So, Dark Soccer, I know we got into it a little bit ago, but would you like to tell us more

427
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,000
about your gaming week?

428
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,120
I, of course, have been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight because it's my jam.

429
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,920
And, of course, I finished Final Fantasy V, and so I started Star Ocean last night.

430
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,760
And mind you, I have never played any of the Star Ocean games.

431
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,120
I knew I would be starting it from scratch pretty much.

432
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
And so far, oh, my God, why did this game not come out over here?

433
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
It's beautiful.

434
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,480
Like, it's the type of pretty level that Sake and Densetsu 2 and 3 were.

435
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:30,000
You know, just really well animated, and it has digitized voice acting.

436
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,240
Like, the whole beginning of the game is voice acted.

437
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,840
It's so good.

438
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,240
And the music is so good.

439
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
Super Metroid did it first.

440
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,600
Super Metroid had hardly any spoken text in comparison to this game.

441
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,120
The last Metroid was in captivity.

442
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Which is the limit of the voice in that.

443
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,560
This has, like, whole bridge conversations.

444
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,200
Tell me, though, that you were floored as a young adult hearing that Super Metroid

445
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
voiceover for the first time.

446
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,640
Like, it's talking.

447
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,360
It's talking.

448
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,920
Anyway, yes.

449
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,840
Well, I'm also going to say Kirby's Avalanche.

450
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,400
Which said even less, Kirby's Avalanche.

451
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,320
And all the characters said things like, yeah, ta.

452
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,960
And how could I forget?

453
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,760
Pikachu!

454
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,360
Pikachu!

455
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,800
At any rate.

456
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,880
But I'm absolutely in love with it.

457
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,160
It's such a good game.

458
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,920
It's such a good game so far.

459
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,280
It's like sci-fi fantasy JRPG gold.

460
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,560
Platinum, even.

461
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,520
I really enjoy it.

462
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,240
So also, of course, I've been playing Marvel's Midnight Suns.

463
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,080
I freaking love, love, love, love, love that game.

464
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,800
It's so good.

465
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
And what else is I playing?

466
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,080
I might be playing a little bit of Cult of the Lambs soon just because I kind of miss

467
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,640
running around and I love the music in that game.

468
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,120
And I need to make sure that my cultists don't forget who to worship.

469
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,280
But yeah, that's been the thing.

470
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,880
And I know what I like.

471
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:30,880
All right.

472
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
Well, speaking of players that I think know the games that they like,

473
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,720
Loki, how was your gaming week?

474
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
Well, it's all Minecraft.

475
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:53,040
It was just working on designing terraforming for an area that I started a few episodes ago.

476
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,600
So with like the creeper man stuff.

477
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,360
And so now I finished the terraforming.

478
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,600
But it took forever to design it because I did a bunch of custom trees.

479
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,880
And so those take time, especially since I'm not copying and pasting them.

480
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
I made like 30 plus trees.

481
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,120
I don't know.

482
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,680
They're big.

483
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,040
So yeah, it's been that.

484
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,280
And then today I've been trying to get I was trying to design stuff for my modded single

485
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,000
player or well, I say single player.

486
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,800
That was a slip.

487
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,800
No, it's multiplayer, but no one plays on the server anymore.

488
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,640
So it my multiplayer series or modded series.

489
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,520
But you know me, I can't stop adding mods to it.

490
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,600
And so I got we finally hit that point where maybe there's too much too many mods added

491
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,320
to the game is having stability problems.

492
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,440
So I'm trying to balance that a little bit.

493
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,000
I think I had one mod that was conflicting with another one.

494
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,640
And I think I found replacements for it.

495
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,240
But then I'm also adding something or want to add something that adds buildable airships.

496
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,720
That might be too much with all the physical, the physics calculations.

497
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:13,120
I know my frame rate was starting to get a bit low with I like having the shaders on.

498
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,720
The shaders look so good, but yeah, it cuts the frame rate in half, especially when you

499
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,800
have like, you know, mods that are doing physics calculations on a bunch of different blocks

500
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,360
and stuff.

501
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,680
It's it's not we may have to turn the shaders off eventually, and that's so hard for me.

502
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,440
No, but I'm playing around with it right now.

503
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,480
So yeah, I'm working on that.

504
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,960
And then hopefully going to I think I may work on the actual building because I designed

505
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,640
everything on our creative server because we have a creative server that we can just

506
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,680
fly around and do whatever.

507
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,520
And then we just copy stuff to a schematic and then bring it over to the survival server,

508
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,720
which then I have to build it all by hand again.

509
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
So I have to do that now.

510
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,240
I've been collecting resources for that.

511
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,240
And they had a lot of leaves, so that took a few days.

512
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,400
And then last year, yesterday, I was just mining the ton.

513
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,240
So I ended up filling up a lot of my storage room with supplies for future projects and

514
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,740
stuff.

515
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,880
So yeah, it looks really, really good, though.

516
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,640
It looks really good because I have these trees that are kind of like they look like

517
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,200
big redwood trees almost.

518
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,320
I guess they're big spruce trees, but they're also because if you play Mega Man or anything

519
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
like that, or at least seen screenshots of it, you know, like in all the backgrounds

520
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,520
and stuff that kind of like nature things, but it's also like artificial nature things.

521
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,400
So you see like kind of panels ripped off the trees where you have metal exposed and

522
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,120
stuff like that.

523
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
So I'm building stuff like that.

524
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,920
It looks really cool.

525
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,680
So I really like the way it came out.

526
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,840
So it'll be hopefully pretty soon.

527
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,520
We'll have an episode out for that.

528
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,560
Okay, cool.

529
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,040
Let's see my gaming week.

530
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,080
So honestly, it's a lot of the stuff I talk about often.

531
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Final Fantasy XIV, my island sanctuary is now rank 11, which means I have access to

532
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,520
the new seeds they added in the recent patch, which I believe is paprika and leeks.

533
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,440
So I'm now growing leeks in my garden.

534
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,480
I'm growing a ton of both of those to kind of get caught up, but I should be ranked 12

535
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,120
next week.

536
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,240
And that means I get access to the new alligator mount and the ever important speedo cosplay

537
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,840
for my character.

538
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,960
Very important to get that.

539
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,920
Dyable, by the way.

540
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,320
So any color that you possibly imagine.

541
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,160
And because glamour, of course, is the end game, true end game of Final Fantasy.

542
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,240
So working on that, still playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, but I actually canceled

543
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,840
my account because I'm like, okay, I think I've done everything I'm going to do in my

544
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,640
little revisiting.

545
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,760
If I suddenly start picking up and doing more mythic dungeons in the next week or something

546
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,440
to keep me engaged, then maybe I'll suck her up and buy another month.

547
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,040
But otherwise I was like, you know what?

548
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,280
I'm going to just cancel it just so I don't accidentally auto renew.

549
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,400
So we'll see how that goes.

550
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,840
Still been playing like cell phone games, you know, between Ingress and Pokemon Go.

551
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,280
There was a classic event for Larvitar Community Day yesterday.

552
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,640
So I did that for a little bit.

553
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,000
Pikmin also, I walked 12,000 steps yesterday because Pikmin had a community day to walk

554
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,800
10,000 steps.

555
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,520
So walked a lot, a lot yesterday, but it was good as daffodil day.

556
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,280
So growing lots of daffodils was the plant they introduced in that game recently.

557
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,080
Also, if you follow the Niantic products, word on the street is, I don't know if this

558
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,960
will actually happen or not, but word on the street is that NBA All World is going to launch

559
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,760
on Tuesday in all regions.

560
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,600
So it's being tested.

561
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,840
It's being tested right now in like France and Canada and like other other regions, very

562
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,440
limited select areas.

563
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,800
Yeah, I'm curious.

564
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,880
Like, look, I may not be a sports person, but number one, sports, when sports video

565
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,520
games are done well, I'll eat it up.

566
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,440
And case in point, if you want to talk NBA, how about NBA Jam?

567
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
Probably one of the greatest fucking sports games of all time.

568
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,120
Even people like me who are like, I don't really play sports games.

569
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
It's like, oh, but NBA Jam is really cool.

570
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,960
So what is the game?

571
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,080
Like, what is the game?

572
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,560
I actually get players.

573
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,360
I've been trying to follow the campfire community with the screenshot system.

574
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,320
I don't know.

575
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,040
I can't tell because all the screenshots are in French.

576
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,120
So I think it looks like you kind of pick up players, you recruit players for a team,

577
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,760
and then you like maybe control courts.

578
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,560
You do like, because I've heard of things like three point shootouts and one on one

579
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,760
games that you play on the court.

580
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,120
But again, don't quote me on any of this because honestly, I don't fucking know.

581
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,360
And until I play the game for myself, I don't know.

582
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,040
I'll try it because I have fucking played every Niantic game and pretty much any AR

583
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,960
game that has come out, I will try it.

584
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,880
And I'll let you all know if it's worth crossing over if you don't usually play sports

585
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,280
games.

586
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,000
But I'm certainly curious.

587
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,240
So I hope they make the release this week.

588
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,680
I mean, don't hold them to it because that release date was in their campfire community

589
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,280
like before the end of the year.

590
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,640
They said they're going to launch globally on January 24th, which is Tuesday.

591
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,160
So we'll see if they do it or not.

592
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,120
So we'll see.

593
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,840
Philan9 says Rob is broing out right now.

594
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,760
I guess I didn't realize that I was actually talking to a friend about the NBA, another

595
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,720
friend that also plays Ingress and Pokemon is into all the games I am.

596
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,360
And I was like, if we get to be our own teams, I don't want to be the Kings.

597
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,320
Absolutely not.

598
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,800
Because living in Sacramento, everybody's going to be the Kings, or they're going to

599
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,360
be the Lakers because we have a lot of Laker fans here who love to, you know, but apparently

600
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,480
I didn't realize the Kings apparently are actually doing very well right now.

601
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,040
Relatively.

602
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,800
They're like third in the league right now.

603
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,840
I was like, what?

604
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,120
When did the Kings get a good team?

605
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,000
That's okay.

606
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,760
Weird timeline we're in now.

607
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,600
I know what's going on.

608
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,640
So I'm like, who's the last place team?

609
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,920
That's the team I'm going to pick.

610
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,960
So it looks like unless otherwise convinced I'll be the Detroit Pistons.

611
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,720
It sounds like so.

612
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,320
But I don't know yet.

613
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
Because honest to God, I was like, well, I'll do a city I like.

614
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,720
I said, I can be the Seattle SuperSonics, right?

615
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,720
And somebody straight had to sit me down and go, Rob, Seattle hasn't had a team since 2008.

616
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,000
This is your reality.

617
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,920
Oh, I'm like, wait, what?

618
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,320
Actually, Seattle tried to steal the Sacramento Kings.

619
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,360
I don't know if you're aware.

620
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,660
What?

621
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,160
Lots of people have.

622
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,780
So.

623
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,960
Anyway, I thought they were going to be the Vegas Kings for a while there.

624
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,000
Well, Vegas got their got our our football team instead.

625
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,960
But is that a blessing or a curse?

626
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,560
It depends who you ask.

627
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,780
All right.

628
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:08,500
Let's see, Mike Deaf says, I'm still waiting for him to get to level 50 in Pogo.

629
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,500
And SJ 100 Matt says, Rob's got to get his max level on every Niantic product.

630
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,860
Well, to be fair, you know who she who shall not be named made me stop playing that Harry

631
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,780
Potter wizards unite before they shut it down.

632
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,140
So I never did get max level on that.

633
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,500
I got to 30.

634
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,140
But that was about as far as I could get before I was like, I.

635
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,000
I can't.

636
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,660
It was that simple.

637
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,340
But I've I've been max level in Ingress.

638
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,660
I'll probably get max level in Pikmin eventually.

639
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,700
It's just walking.

640
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,200
I'll get there.

641
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,100
Pokemon is the tough thing is those level up gates.

642
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm just too unmotivated to fight 50 Team Rocket leaders because you have to do things

643
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,180
that are very hard to multitask in those games.

644
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,020
Meaning I can't play like Ingress and Pikmin and because I've got to sit there and go,

645
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,700
here's a Team Rocket, stop, fight, fight, fight, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

646
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,140
Okay, here's the leader.

647
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,380
Stop, spit, tap, tap, tap, bite, bite, bite.

648
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,660
It's like I can't be bothered to do the level up quest.

649
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,380
That's my problem.

650
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,380
I'll get there eventually.

651
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:11,540
All right.

652
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,220
One other game I played this week and then I'll be done.

653
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,740
I promise the other game I played this week blast from the past.

654
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,500
Ikaruga I played because apparently it is free.

655
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,820
I don't know if it's still free right this moment, but in this morning it was free on

656
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,500
the Xbox Argentina store and specifically you have to be in the Argentina marketplace.

657
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,460
I don't know why.

658
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,780
I don't know if it's some sort of holiday or something.

659
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,300
Pardon me.

660
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,860
What is unique about Xbox Argentina?

661
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,340
But you can get it free in that store right now, or at least maybe somebody in chat will

662
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,380
fact check me live here.

663
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,860
I put the link on my Mastodon if somebody wants to check if it's still there.

664
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,260
But it was free.

665
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,380
It's not free on the US store.

666
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,500
It's like $3.29 or some price still right now.

667
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,340
But yeah, I grabbed that and I checked it out because even though it was an Xbox 360,

668
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:08,660
which obviously was a re-release of something for the Dreamcast, you can play it on series

669
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,540
SNX because it's one of the backwards compatible titles.

670
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,060
So looks great.

671
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,660
All right.

672
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,180
Mike Def says it's normally free there for some reason, like every month it goes free

673
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,620
on Xbox Argentina.

674
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,500
Interesting.

675
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,660
Well, today was the day that it caught my attention and I went and I was like, oh, sure

676
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,220
enough.

677
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,180
Even though I have a US account, I can click on that, redeem it.

678
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,820
And here I am.

679
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,100
I'm playing it on my Xbox.

680
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,220
So that was fun.

681
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,700
Cool.

682
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,200
Yep.

683
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,140
It's a hard fucking game too, by the way.

684
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,940
I mean, I know we all know that, but just to reiterate, Ikaruga, it's a hard fucking

685
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,580
game.

686
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:42,900
All right.

687
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,620
It is.

688
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,120
Yeah.

689
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:44,980
All right.

690
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,460
Well, you can get radiant silver gun for Switch.

691
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,620
Oh, yeah, that's true.

692
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,300
I haven't gotten anything on Switch in a while.

693
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,380
Not since Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which I still need to go back and beat.

694
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,060
I kind of let that wagon derail, but I keep hearing they're going to do patches.

695
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,420
So I'm like, maybe I'll just wait for the home patch at this point, which will probably

696
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,100
patch in a lot of performance stuff too.

697
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,740
Even though I wasn't super bothered by it.

698
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,140
I don't know.

699
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,700
There's something I'm like, if I know I'm not playing the game in its final form, I

700
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,220
get really weird about it.

701
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,720
I don't know.

702
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,080
All right.

703
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,740
Let's get into some other headlines and what's going on in the gaming world, including some

704
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,020
more bad news.

705
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,820
But I don't know.

706
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,180
This one I think we all saw coming.

707
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,020
Unexpected.

708
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,220
It's because it's Square Enix and Square Enix has.

709
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:36,020
A pattern of behavior when it comes to live service games, they like to cancel them after

710
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,140
not much support.

711
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:44,740
And so, you know, now I guess this is an Embracer group that owns it, but you know, I'm still

712
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,300
seeing this tainted by Square Enix, though.

713
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:53,220
So Marvel Avengers is ending all official support, and that's going to be in September.

714
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,180
So you still got some time.

715
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:01,220
You can still play some more of it, but they're going to be basically that update 2.8, which

716
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:06,820
comes out at the end of March 23rd, is going to be the end of the content and feature rollout.

717
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:15,220
And they're also saying that on September 30th, all official support will end and the

718
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:21,300
single player and multiplayer will still be available as well as some of the facets of

719
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,780
the game.

720
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,300
But there are going to be other parts that are shut down.

721
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,140
Credits will not be purchasable.

722
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,020
And I think the cosmetics are going to be made free.

723
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,740
And in case you're wondering for all of those out there that may not own a Sony copy of

724
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,580
this game, you're like, Hey, cool.

725
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,940
Do I get Spider-Man now?

726
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,300
No, you don't get Spider-Man.

727
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,660
Sorry.

728
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,700
Sony has Spider-Man.

729
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,300
They're never going to let you have Spider-Man.

730
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,680
That's it.

731
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:51,960
I wonder if it'll stay on Game Pass, even though they're getting rid of the because

732
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,360
you can't even buy a new digital copyright.

733
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,120
So I'm assuming that means it'll leave Game Pass, too, which is going to be interesting.

734
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,360
So, yeah, I don't know.

735
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,360
I mean, look, I'm not wishful thinking about Spider-Man.

736
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,920
I understand that's a Sony thing, but I like that I can play it on Game Pass without Spider-Man.

737
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,080
But I didn't play it a lot.

738
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,600
And so maybe I'm part of the problem.

739
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,080
I don't know.

740
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,840
Well, no, I think part of the problem is the fact that the game looked like it was a live

741
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,320
service game that shoehorned into a single player game.

742
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,120
Like, I think this was developed originally as like a single player game.

743
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,480
And they're like, we want more money.

744
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,280
And so they like shoved this like, really grindy end game into it.

745
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,360
And people just didn't like they used a beloved license to try to create a money machine.

746
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,040
And the whole thing was very transparent.

747
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,400
And everyone saw right through it.

748
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,640
That is the story of Marvel Avengers in a sentence.

749
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,520
And it was also, I think, rough around the edges, too, when it came out, if I remember correctly.

750
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:54,280
So once again, you know, rush this stuff to market so we can make as much money as possible.

751
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,120
And yeah.

752
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,620
Yeah.

753
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,960
I mean, look, I'll give them this.

754
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,520
I'll give them this.

755
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,160
At least it wasn't EA running the game because the game would have been shut down a year

756
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,840
and a half ago if it was EA running it.

757
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,960
So I'll give them this.

758
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,440
They really tried.

759
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,880
They really tried to make it happen.

760
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,200
I think if they didn't sell to the Embracer group,

761
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,240
if this game wasn't sold as part of that, I think it would have been shut down earlier.

762
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,800
I mean, look at like what Square Enix has shut down recently.

763
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,960
They had that Final Fantasy 7 game that it was like

764
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,920
The fact that you don't even know what the fuck it is, is very telling.

765
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,360
I know because it's a Final Fantasy 7 game, which means it has a complicated subtitle to it.

766
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,000
So it's like, I want to say all the breaks.

767
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't even know if it's all the bravest or something like that.

768
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,080
But it was one of the ones that's like.

769
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,880
Oh, Mike Deft with a great point.

770
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,840
I'm still freaking bitter.

771
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
What happened to Chocobo GP?

772
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,560
That's a very good point.

773
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,280
Yeah, that too.

774
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,840
That too.

775
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,160
Yeah.

776
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,560
So it's just it's a pattern behavior from them.

777
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,400
Just don't buy into any of their live service games.

778
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,560
Like actually any company really wish the companies out there would like start treating

779
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,880
live service like loot boxes, like in the sense that it's like a bad word and just,

780
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,560
you know, people don't want it type of thing.

781
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,880
I don't know.

782
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,080
It's just it's annoying.

783
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,880
Fifth Dream in chat says, what's that prequel Final Fantasy game that's a souls like or

784
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,640
something that went nowhere?

785
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,440
I think you're referring to Strangers of Paradise.

786
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
Is that the one where the fuck chaos?

787
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,200
Is it that one that you're thinking of?

788
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,640
There's actually DLC coming out real soon for that, because I've been really tempted

789
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,520
to buy it.

790
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,320
But like, it won't go on sale enough.

791
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,760
I should have bought it on the stinkin epic store with the 25% off coupon that probably

792
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,480
is the best deal I was going to find for a while, but I forgot or I didn't do it.

793
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,200
Like I'm waiting for that game to really get a deep discount before I pick that up.

794
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,240
But I'm odd.

795
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,560
I thought the demo for Strangers of Paradise was special.

796
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,400
So it was a unique experience.

797
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,840
So I would try it again for sure.

798
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,120
So let's see.

799
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,880
DGRMS says, I'm waiting until that game drops to $20.

800
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,120
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at as well, for sure.

801
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,360
So anyway.

802
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,680
Yep.

803
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,560
It's a bummer about what happened with the Marvel Avengers game.

804
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:21,160
But again, when you are that obviously transparent about trying to milk everyone for every dollar

805
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,560
in their wallets and every possible mini transaction you can in the game, this is what's going

806
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,040
to happen.

807
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,680
At least, you know, the fact they're unlocking all the cosmetics and stuff, I guess is cool.

808
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,760
But it's one of those might as well because they've made every dollar they're going to

809
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,560
make off that game.

810
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,240
Might as well show the fans who stuck with you some love, right?

811
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,880
All right.

812
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,280
Well, one game that's done very well for itself over the years is The Witcher 3.

813
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,600
I mean, hell, it lended itself to a television show, which yes, I know it's really about

814
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,560
the books.

815
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,920
But let's be real, the show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the games.

816
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,040
So The Witcher 3 and, you know, this game's come out several times and it's getting another

817
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,560
basically re-release because there's a next gen patch on the way.

818
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:13,960
The next gen patch for the PC is in final stages, as they say, whereas the console version

819
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,960
is actually going to be headed to retail and it's coming out on the 26th.

820
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,600
So The Witcher 3, and I almost said The Witcher 5 because I'm thinking PlayStation 5, but

821
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,240
The Witcher 3 next gen will be coming out for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox series

822
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,000
on January 26.

823
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,440
This is the complete edition.

824
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,840
This means all of the previous DLC is there and all the quality of life improvements and

825
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,520
all of that good stuff as well.

826
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,920
This does not mean the PC update is coming on the 26th.

827
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,720
The next gen patch is just at the final stages and they're saying it shouldn't be long before

828
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,680
it's out.

829
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,280
So whether that means one month, three months, we really don't know.

830
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,040
We're just at the mercy of them.

831
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,880
Bug testing, which, hey, you know what?

832
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,040
Don't release it half bait.

833
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,920
Get it right.

834
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,080
So I'm sure they've got it.

835
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,880
You know, if it is next gen, they got to make sure it still has decent performance and all

836
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,920
that stuff too.

837
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,240
But yeah, admittedly, I didn't play enough Witcher 3, but a next gen update will definitely

838
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,680
get me to take another look, especially, you know, I'm running kind of a nice rig on PC

839
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,080
now.

840
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,000
So whenever they get that PC version out, I'd love to play it.

841
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,040
I really would.

842
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,640
So I'll keep an eye on that.

843
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,320
All right, moving on.

844
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,040
Dark Sakura.

845
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:31,480
So I alluded to this before when we were talking about the layoffs and whatnot and community

846
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,040
support.

847
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,440
The Game Developers Conference released its annual video games industry report.

848
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:44,200
We have various statistics, but one of the ones on there is the illustrated the rise

849
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,480
of player driven harassment against game developers.

850
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:55,560
They said they were very confused about the toxicity of player bases, with 75% of developers

851
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,160
noting it was a very serious industry issue.

852
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,840
40% of developers claimed that they had faced direct harassment or as part of a team.

853
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:15,640
A portion of these respondents identified as members of the LGBTQIA plus or non male.

854
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:25,320
Or non male communities and different developers have come for different tactics, including

855
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:34,760
banning deplatforming the cruelest of them, which honestly I'm for.

856
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,920
Boundaries do very much need to be set.

857
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,320
But yeah, that's sort of like they're one of the quotes is ban, isolate and deplatform.

858
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:53,240
You know, others have also said, though, that studios need to have and this is a quote,

859
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,040
easily accessible hotlines for developers that are facing harassment to set proper

860
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,360
boundaries and stop inviting the community to be part of the family.

861
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,600
One developer was even saying that they had some death threats to their family.

862
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,800
None of that is acceptable people.

863
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,840
None of that.

864
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,760
But the biggest thing is at the core of what they want is unionization.

865
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:27,800
53% of the developers believe that they should unionize for protected rights.

866
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,360
Only 13% of the respondents disagreed.

867
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:41,080
And they're really just looking at overall protecting themselves, protecting their

868
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:47,560
their livelihoods and protecting their their safety, their mental health, too.

869
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,680
So and I'm going to say this right now.

870
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,880
Be critical of what you love.

871
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,960
It's the only way something can get better at the same time.

872
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,160
Don't be a little shit about it.

873
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,960
OK, that's unforgivable, right?

874
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:09,880
These are people doing their their jobs at the direction of other people.

875
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:16,920
And I mean, it's not like they're they're going around and, you know, like stabbing

876
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,360
people in the face or something.

877
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,800
No, if they were doing that.

878
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, fuck drag them.

879
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,560
You know, if they were doing things that were causing harm to other people.

880
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,680
Yeah, drag them.

881
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,800
But they're making a game.

882
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:36,040
And just because you don't like the game or something about the game, it doesn't mean

883
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:43,720
that you can go out there and threaten someone's life or be that terrible to them about it.

884
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,760
It's just you just can't.

885
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,080
Same goes with like streamers.

886
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,040
Don't go attacking them because they don't play the game the way that you like them to

887
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:57,160
play it or or whatever, you know, or reality television stars on things like RuPaul's Drag

888
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,660
Race.

889
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,160
Just seeing all the hate people get on social media from that, too, is just unreal.

890
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,440
It's if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.

891
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:15,000
And if you can't be constructively and tactfully critical.

892
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,080
Keep it to yourself.

893
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,960
You there's paper.

894
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,400
These things exist called journals.

895
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,640
You can write it down there.

896
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,400
There is a void that you can shout into.

897
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,880
You can go to a forest where no one else is around and see if anyone can hear you if you,

898
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,000
you know, yell into it.

899
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,680
It's there's there's plenty of things you could do.

900
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,120
You could you could go find some dirt and bury your head in it.

901
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,440
Play Ostrich.

902
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,520
Exactly.

903
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,020
Exactly.

904
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,960
On a serious note, though, I one of those elements that you kind of said there about

905
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,680
kind of creating a support system for this.

906
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,360
I mean, it's sad that that we're at the point that we need one.

907
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,920
But recognizing that, yes, we need one.

908
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:03,320
I do kind of love the concept of perhaps a an employer's employee assistance program.

909
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,440
Many big employers, hell, even small and medium sized employers, many employers, probably

910
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,880
yours, offer some type of EAP or employee assistance program, which is usually a type

911
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:21,160
of mental health benefit because, you know, happy workers lead to productive workers.

912
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,400
Right.

913
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,360
And so forth.

914
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:29,960
But all of those semantics aside, I'm I would I would be surprised if these companies couldn't,

915
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,400
you know, put some of this wellness of how to deal with harassment into their employee

916
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,840
assistance programs.

917
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,120
So let's say help.

918
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,720
I'm being harassed on social media and like they're coming after my family.

919
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,440
What can I do?

920
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,240
Maybe there can be like a crisis support through some of these employee assistance, you know,

921
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,120
at their EA, at their Square Enix, wherever it is they work that can help them in getting

922
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,760
through that.

923
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,080
And, you know, support group, other people.

924
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,400
Here's what you can do to lock down your social media.

925
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,240
Here's, you know, what you should and shouldn't read.

926
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,560
And, you know, those those types of things to help them through it.

927
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,240
I would really like to call on I mean, I know nobody's fucking listening, but like you

928
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:07,720
all are.

929
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,440
But I mean, nobody influential in the industry is Bobby Kotick's not fucking listening.

930
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,160
Okay.

931
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,360
But I would throw out a challenge to the industry to, you know, and if it's not already in,

932
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,280
maybe some companies, I bet a lot of them do have something like this in their EAP.

933
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,200
But I would really like to call out to the gaming industry for their employee assistance

934
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:26,680
program.

935
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,160
A, if they don't have one, fucking get one.

936
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:35,320
B, embed within that program this type of support system because unfortunately, in the

937
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,240
year 20 and 23, it is needed.

938
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,680
That is it.

939
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,920
Ooh, this is the clapping emoji in chat.

940
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,080
So you know, this is serious for Mike Deft.

941
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,120
The same goes for localization teams.

942
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,840
Localization is not censorship.

943
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,480
Ooh, a thousand percent that, Mike Deft.

944
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,120
A hundred thousand percent that for sure.

945
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,800
Funara with a comment here, very important.

946
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,240
The problems you face in the game are not necessarily their fault.

947
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,800
And with all the layoffs and labor shortages, they may not have had the time or funds to

948
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,920
test any issues.

949
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,480
Yes.

950
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,640
Or I mean, hell, they probably did.

951
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,080
I mean, classic example, playing Skyrim.

952
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,080
Doesn't Bethesda fucking test these games?

953
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,440
Yeah, they do.

954
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,760
And honestly, that bug was probably found and it was reported.

955
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,640
And you know what?

956
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,360
It was determined that bug doesn't break the game.

957
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,520
The bug is not a, what do they call that?

958
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,480
A stage, a stage ender, a deal.

959
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,840
I don't remember what they call that in the industry, but it's something about, it's not

960
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,360
a, it doesn't cut off the game.

961
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,560
It doesn't end the game.

962
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,440
It's not a crisis basically thing.

963
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,040
So we're keeping it in to meet our deadline and we'll patch it up later.

964
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,560
That's not the testing team's fault, for sure.

965
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,800
Showstopper.

966
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,440
Thank you, Bobby.

967
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,160
That's what I was looking for.

968
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,800
Showstopper.

969
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,560
Sjo and Hunter Matt says, don't be upset or surprised when companies are reluctant to

970
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,400
show early footage of their game because they don't want to draw the ire of the internet

971
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,120
scum Lords.

972
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,200
Funara says, it's like trying to attack the people in a grocery store for supply shortages

973
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,000
or prices of industry-wide things like eggs.

974
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,560
Oh yeah.

975
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,960
Or God, when it was fucking toilet paper, like the people, you know, yelling at people

976
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,800
at Costco, like, like, like it's not their problem too.

977
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,360
It's not their fault.

978
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,160
It's not their, like those Costco employees are also probably trying to find toilet paper

979
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,200
or whatever it is.

980
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,440
They want the thing and they want you to know that they're selfish and want the thing.

981
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,960
I see this every day, even outside of just treating employees bad, just like with people

982
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,320
just choosing which laws that they want to follow, especially traffic laws.

983
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,760
The amount of people that run red lights near me, near a school is ridiculous.

984
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:58,360
And on top of that, other people aren't calling them out, you know, like, oh, I don't want

985
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,400
to get involved with that.

986
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,600
That doesn't involve me.

987
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,200
It does fucking involve me.

988
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,480
That doesn't involve me.

989
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,000
It does fucking involve you.

990
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:13,800
You know, you, as, as a society, we sort of, we do have a responsibility to each other

991
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,800
to make sure that the society that we're in functions properly.

992
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,040
And I will not hesitate to tell someone they're being a little shit to the employee who can't

993
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,920
do anything about it.

994
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,160
And I've done it in the middle of die.

995
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:32,520
So I have yelled at someone for not wearing their mask because the employee couldn't do

996
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,020
it.

997
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,240
I was like, do you not see that other people here have their masks on?

998
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,880
Get out, put your mask on, and then you can come back in.

999
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,840
I don't have to be nice to you because I'm not an employee.

1000
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,520
And I'm sure they walked right out of the store and said, what a bitch, you know, but

1001
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,720
it's like, oh, I don't care.

1002
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,520
Yeah, exactly.

1003
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,020
Good.

1004
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,200
I'm also your worst nightmare.

1005
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,480
Why don't you use that term too?

1006
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,200
I, I, well, I mean, you know, I used to do it at, um, at golf land back in the day when

1007
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,960
people were being assholes.

1008
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,640
I have no problem with speaking up.

1009
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:13,240
And if I see someone is being, you know, is harassing someone for their, their race or

1010
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,360
their gender, you damn well better believe I'm going to say something.

1011
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,880
And that's why this shit happens in the world because no one else stands up and says that's

1012
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,520
enough.

1013
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,680
That's, that's being an ally in those sorts of, it is up to

1014
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:34,120
non LGBTQ plus people to say to their non LGBTQ plus people, friends, when a joke is, or the

1015
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,560
FAG word is used or whatever it is, you know, or, or, uh, pronouns or somebody's, somebody

1016
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,480
is saying it as a pronoun or one of those types of dirty things is happening.

1017
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,320
It's up to those people to say, Hey, that's not funny.

1018
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:47,800
That's not cool.

1019
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,600
Don't do that.

1020
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,840
Like what, why, why are you doing that?

1021
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,720
On top of that?

1022
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:58,440
I mean, I, I am, you know, I have to deal with people who are going, Oh, that's not

1023
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,720
really an orientation.

1024
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,720
It's like, yeah, it is.

1025
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,320
Or having doctors try to prescribe me hormones because they think that being ace is a hormonal

1026
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:15,000
disease, which is not, I check out fine, you know, or having, you know, people, you know,

1027
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,920
what, after I converted saying, Oh, now you're a candidate for a gas chamber.

1028
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,520
Oh, disgusting.

1029
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,680
It's really disgusting, especially after, you know, you know, what ascended for the

1030
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:34,440
four years and, and, and I'm just saying, you know, that it's, it's like, you know,

1031
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,880
the things, and then they came for me.

1032
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,440
Don't wait for them to come for you.

1033
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,920
Don't let them come for anybody.

1034
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,800
To try to lighten the mood a little bit.

1035
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,680
Let me read this chat comment here because it's totally true.

1036
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,400
Sj 100.

1037
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,440
Matt says as an aside, don't pick a fight at a waffle house.

1038
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,960
The employees will mess you up.

1039
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,320
Fuck around and find out.

1040
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah, that is true.

1041
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,160
As a connoisseur of many a waffle house acts.

1042
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:01,640
I do.

1043
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,440
I do.

1044
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,720
I completely understand.

1045
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,640
We're never getting waffle house in California.

1046
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,000
I also understand for those that live in California, waffle house gets severely overrated.

1047
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,560
Like it's like the rest of you in and out to be quite frankly.

1048
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,880
But it's, it's one of those issues.

1049
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,120
I do wish we had waffle house in California.

1050
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,840
Cause I'm going to tell you Denny's is not it.

1051
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,480
Period.

1052
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,080
Denny's is not it.

1053
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,600
There's only one place I have eaten at that the food tastes just like it does a waffle house.

1054
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,040
And that's that Ed's place in San Francisco over on Fillmore.

1055
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,920
It's been open since 1972.

1056
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,000
And they're probably just trying to emulate the waffle house strategy to be fair.

1057
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,760
Honestly, I think I have a theory that it was open by somebody who had waffle,

1058
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,960
who went to waffle houses.

1059
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,400
Like I like this.

1060
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,360
I'm going to make this.

1061
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,280
And of course we all know about the waffle house index.

1062
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,440
I mean, even the house is closed run.

1063
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,360
Even though the food is pretty shit.

1064
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,720
Like I'm just, you know, it's, it's, it's comfort food.

1065
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,160
I understand, but it's pretty shit.

1066
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,480
Comfort.

1067
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,840
Look, Taco Bell food is shit too, but it's comfort food.

1068
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,160
Okay.

1069
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,840
So Taco Bell food is actual shit.

1070
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,720
I don't care.

1071
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,400
No, that's still taco all the way.

1072
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,160
I will say, yeah.

1073
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,600
Why would you ever go to Taco Bell when there's a Del Taco there on the same street?

1074
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,000
Why?

1075
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,520
I like what fifth stream says.

1076
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,800
It's it's like a bar Wolverine would hang out in, but with hash browns.

1077
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,040
I forgot.

1078
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,680
I forgot what I was going to say about waffle house now.

1079
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,040
The food is shit, but it's comforting.

1080
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,720
And yes, it's exactly, it's comfortable.

1081
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,000
It's in a comforting environment.

1082
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,680
You, you know what you're going to fucking get at three in the morning at waffle house.

1083
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,720
You know, the coffee is going to be hot.

1084
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,280
They'll always put on a fresh pot for you.

1085
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,040
You can get those hash brown covered smothered chunked, diced.

1086
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,480
There's this and always order your waffle.

1087
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,280
Well done.

1088
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,360
There's this, there's a certain cadence to the, I mean, it's literally all in front of

1089
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:56,520
you.

1090
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,160
You can watch them make the fucking food from start to finish.

1091
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,320
Not a lot of chains to do the food.

1092
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,000
There's not a lot of chains to do that.

1093
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,840
Throw a chair at a waffle house employee and they will parry it like Daigo.

1094
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,100
True.

1095
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,200
All right.

1096
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,960
Anyway, let's see what else is there.

1097
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,120
Bobby Black Wolf says a bag of waffle house grits in my pantry and I'm about to make them.

1098
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,720
Bobby Black Wolf says we're soon getting in and outs in Tennessee in a few years.

1099
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,480
So soon we won't care about it anymore.

1100
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,480
It's like that fucking raising canes just opened up on every block here.

1101
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,400
And at first it was like, wow, we're finally getting raising canes.

1102
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,760
Literally, it's like three months later and it's like, okay, everybody stopped caring.

1103
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,240
Well, they also have now came out here.

1104
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,200
What, Loki?

1105
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:47,880
I was going to say they also have now like, um, all the hot chicken, Nashville hot chicken

1106
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,840
places before it used to be like, hey, ooh, national, uh, national proper.

1107
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,880
Heck yeah.

1108
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,320
I like I'm craving that.

1109
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,320
And it's like, oh, hey, there's a restaurant, national tender.

1110
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,520
I'll try that out.

1111
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:09,400
Nashville, uh, nations, nations, like a Nashville hot.

1112
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,120
Oh, got it.

1113
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:10,360
Okay.

1114
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,840
Okay.

1115
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,080
It's, it's like fried chicken with like, they put it like way too much spice on it to where

1116
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,920
it's like you just in torture.

1117
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,560
I love it though.

1118
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,040
It's great.

1119
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,000
And he's, you know, serve it on a piece of, uh, white bread and pickles and stuff.

1120
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,280
You know, it's good stuff.

1121
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,480
Chicken stress.

1122
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,360
But, um, they have like now Dave's hot chicken.

1123
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,880
There's like all like so many hot chicken places now.

1124
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,400
And they're not all of them are great.

1125
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,000
Oh, I want crystals so I can eat my corn pups in peace.

1126
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,640
Here's what you should all be jealous of on the East coast that you don't have that we

1127
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:43,960
have.

1128
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,920
It's a newer thing.

1129
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:49,160
And I'm telling you, this place is addicting AF and I'm sure my co-hosts are going to roll

1130
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:49,640
their eyes.

1131
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,200
I don't care.

1132
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,920
I think the thing y'all are missing is Dutch brothers.

1133
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,680
That my eyes are rolling so far that I'm going to fall out of my chair.

1134
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,720
Like I love me too.

1135
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,320
It's it's and yeah, I say that as I'm not drinking Dutch brothers on stream, but it's

1136
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,760
because because the drive-throughs are always a fucking you think in and out drive-through

1137
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,320
lines are long.

1138
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,600
Go to a fucking Dutch brothers.

1139
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,080
Jesus.

1140
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,600
Dutch brothers are to the coffee world.

1141
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,600
What Apple is to the technology world.

1142
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,880
You'll have people that just.

1143
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,200
I'm like why the people that purchase their products?

1144
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:26,600
Hold on.

1145
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,920
Let me describe what you're saying on my iPhone.

1146
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,320
Yes.

1147
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,120
What were you saying?

1148
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,200
What I'm saying is overrated.

1149
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,720
My iPhone is a webcam.

1150
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,320
They insist they insist on placing their plopping down their stupid businesses.

1151
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,680
I say plop because it's shit.

1152
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:48,520
They plop it down in like the most inconvenient places ever because it's the size of like

1153
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,400
one of those photos.

1154
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,200
This is probably predating a lot of people.

1155
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:52,680
Sorry.

1156
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,680
You kids know what a photo booth is?

1157
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:54,840
Yeah.

1158
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,080
Do you know what a photo booth is?

1159
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,720
A photo mat?

1160
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:57,960
Yeah.

1161
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,360
Where you know they can drive through photo mat.

1162
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,800
Those photo booths now will post to your Facebook automatically.

1163
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,000
That's the new thing they all do.

1164
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:05,880
Okay.

1165
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,200
Well, this is a drive-through photo mat like back when we had film cameras.

1166
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:10,920
Okay.

1167
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,000
And so they're like that size.

1168
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,600
Like the small checkers.

1169
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:19,560
Think of think of like the size of your utility shed in the backyard or something like that.

1170
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,640
They converted that into a coffee place and decided to park it in the middle of a parking

1171
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:23,880
lot.

1172
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,800
And so there's no adequate...

1173
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:31,320
They have drive-through lines going two different directions sometimes or it's just weaving

1174
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,960
through everywhere and blocking everything because they're ill-prepared to serve the

1175
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,560
amount of customers that they have because they don't have a storefront because I guess

1176
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,440
that costs too much or it's not like cool enough.

1177
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,800
And then the worst part about it, and don't get me wrong, like I'm sure their coffee is

1178
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,440
good and I have no problem with the coffee.

1179
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,400
What I have a problem with is the people that go there and then decide, hey, you know what

1180
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:55,960
we're going to do?

1181
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:02,840
I'm going to put a crap ton of your products, advertising, bumper stickers all over the

1182
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,080
fuck my van and my car.

1183
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,200
I see that shit fucking everywhere and it's really annoying.

1184
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,320
Too expensive for me to put stickers all over it.

1185
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:11,560
Okay.

1186
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,920
I'll say what they did to tie it back to video games.

1187
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,720
They've stolen the Xbox achievement system for their app.

1188
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:22,360
And I know like Alan actually is like, oh, if I go today, I can get like a heart sticker

1189
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:22,840
for my eyes.

1190
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,280
It's not even a real sticker, but apparently if you go on the first of the month, they

1191
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,400
do give you a real sticker.

1192
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,920
So that's a thing.

1193
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,720
Anyway.

1194
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,360
Oh my gosh.

1195
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:30,760
Okay.

1196
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,720
So they're the kindergarten class of like coffee places.

1197
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,120
Low-key, they're so good.

1198
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,200
Say this as I have an actual sticker book.

1199
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,280
And you can get non-coffee drinks there too.

1200
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,840
And they're not even paying me to say this, but they should pay me in coffee.

1201
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,560
Jesus.

1202
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,320
But you can get like energy drinks and non-coffee things there too.

1203
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:47,640
Yeah.

1204
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,080
I know that they have stuff.

1205
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,320
I've gone there and gotten a coffee before, but like I will never do it again.

1206
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,360
Torani Syrup Bar.

1207
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,320
That's all that place is.

1208
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:00,280
But anyway, just a couple of comments in chat here on the food, and then I'm going to move

1209
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:00,520
on.

1210
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:06,280
Number one, Pod Culture in chat says White Castle greater than Crystal's?

1211
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,240
Crystal's.

1212
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,280
I almost said Crystalis.

1213
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,720
I would love a White Castle.

1214
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:15,480
I've never actually had like IRL White Castle other than like the microwave stuff.

1215
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,960
White Castle is the most disgusting fucking fast food I've ever had in my life.

1216
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,240
That is the most, like you could not have a more wrong opinion.

1217
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,400
Sorry, Pod Culture.

1218
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,200
I don't know Crystal's.

1219
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,160
So maybe, but that was, I had it in Vegas.

1220
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,280
That was disgusting.

1221
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,000
Crystal is kind of the same theory as White Castle, but I always have to tell them not

1222
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,120
to put any mustard or pickle on my sandwich.

1223
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:44,280
But they have an amazing thing on their menu that I greatly miss, and that is the Corn

1224
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,240
Pup is tiny little corn dogs.

1225
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,600
Oh, that's tiny little corn dogs.

1226
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,200
It's just the steaming of the burger.

1227
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,560
No, no.

1228
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,400
I remember when we were so desperate to get Dunkin Donuts, and we have one near us now,

1229
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:05,400
and I really wish it was Krispy Kreme instead, because I don't like Dunkin.

1230
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:12,200
I love Dunkin Donuts because I can get more cake-style donuts rather than what they had

1231
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,000
at Krispy Kreme.

1232
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:18,280
And I grew up with freaking Krispy Kreme, and I'm very sad that the one from the 50s

1233
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,800
that was on Government Street in Mobile is gone.

1234
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,480
Pisses me the fuck off.

1235
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:31,480
But I like, when I came out here and had donuts that were not from Krispy Kreme for the first

1236
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:37,560
time in my life, I was like, cake donuts, a lot of cake donuts.

1237
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:43,720
Yeah, I will say the food at Krispy Kreme is better than Dunkin, but the coffee is better

1238
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,240
at Dunkin than it is at Krispy Kreme.

1239
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:50,040
But you're right, that is the one thing that California seemingly has that I do notice

1240
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,320
is that because we don't have a lot of Krispy Kreme and Dunkin, there's a lot of mom and

1241
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,760
pop donut shops.

1242
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,240
And I will say, nothing beats those.

1243
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,480
Nothing beats those for donuts.

1244
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:05,400
I do like, I really do like, though, they're just regular glazed donuts.

1245
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,200
So like the Krispy Kreme ones, I could eat those like by the dozen.

1246
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:16,360
But that's the thing I missed about the one on Government Street, because it had the conveyor

1247
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,480
in the back where they cooked them.

1248
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,320
Oh, that was awesome.

1249
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,120
And you go in when the hot sign is on.

1250
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,960
And that was when they were the best.

1251
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,680
Yeah, we had one by the mall, and then it became a Panera Bread.

1252
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,400
What was the big chain that was at Winchell's that used to be all over California?

1253
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,320
Now, I think they're only in Southern California, but most mom and pop shops are pretty much

1254
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,120
Winchell's are pretty much that, like, is that it's pretty much what all mom and pop

1255
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,840
stores are modeled after.

1256
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,400
Okay, there was one other food comment because I had to get to it.

1257
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,040
And now I don't.

1258
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,160
Oh, dang, where was it?

1259
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,080
So y'all are going off on food.

1260
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,960
I'm like, do we spend too much time talking about food on this show?

1261
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,800
And then like, y'all blow up the chat.

1262
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,040
Yeah, see, Fifth Dream says, I like Dairy Queen food.

1263
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,800
I'm not going to lie.

1264
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,520
It's so bad.

1265
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:07,400
But where else can you get country gravy, Texas toast with chicken strips?

1266
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,440
That's a good idea.

1267
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:15,400
The only thing I don't like about Dairy Queen, and this is just it saddens me so much.

1268
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,600
So Dairy Queen purchased Orange Julius, and then Orange Julius disappeared out of the

1269
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,560
malls, and they used to have Orange Julius available at Dairy Queen.

1270
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,000
Now they don't have it at all.

1271
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
They have made Orange Julius extinct.

1272
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,600
And that makes me so sad.

1273
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,800
This word did used to be good.

1274
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,440
Okay, the comment was from Mike Deft.

1275
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,960
And it was a response to we were talking about Taco Bell and Del Taco.

1276
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,360
And he said something along the lines of it's all shit.

1277
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,520
What did he say?

1278
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,440
Oh, all of those Mexican fast food are shit with Mexican in quotes.

1279
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,520
And that is from our resident listener that actually lives in Mexico.

1280
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,960
Unless it's Jim Boys, and then it just gives you the shits.

1281
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,240
Here's the thing about Taco Bell and Del Taco and all that.

1282
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,640
Taco Bell is not Mexican food.

1283
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,600
It is Taco Bell.

1284
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,360
You have to go into it.

1285
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,960
Taco Bell is not Mexican food.

1286
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,000
It's just not food.

1287
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,760
It's Southern California food.

1288
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,120
If I want something that resembles Mexican food, I would go to, like, Chando's Tacos

1289
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,400
or something that is a lot more like authentic street taco type of fare.

1290
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,040
Well, Chando's is extremely greasy.

1291
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,040
Near my house, but I cannot eat at Jim Boys because it makes me immediately sick.

1292
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,600
Jim Boys is one of the...

1293
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,400
It's honestly my first week out here.

1294
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,760
Dan took me to Jim Boys.

1295
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,320
I'll leave it at that.

1296
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,920
When Shane lived with us for a little bit, we went to Jim Boys one day and Shane was like,

1297
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,200
never again.

1298
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,360
That was me.

1299
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,080
Jim Boys.

1300
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,400
I know.

1301
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:37,960
I love Jim Boys.

1302
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,000
Their tacos are good.

1303
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,480
I don't know.

1304
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,120
All right.

1305
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,600
But Chando's...

1306
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,800
I thought I had a cast iron digestive system.

1307
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,760
No, I don't.

1308
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,600
Chando's is good, except for their...

1309
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,040
Like, I used to get their, like, kind of stuffed quesadillas that they have.

1310
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,240
And it's just like, it's just grease.

1311
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,840
It's solid grease.

1312
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,560
That's the only thing.

1313
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,240
It's like so heavy and so bad.

1314
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:07,560
And then they also have their street corn, which I love Elodie, but it's sour.

1315
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,160
Like, I don't think it's supposed to be sour.

1316
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,240
Like, it's not good sour.

1317
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,400
I've had a lot of street corn from a different bunch of different places, and it's sour,

1318
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,600
like sour milk.

1319
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:19,960
All right.

1320
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,160
Clearly, we've derailed with Orange Challenge Fudio.

1321
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:23,960
Let's try to get back.

1322
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,960
Hey, look, what do we do when we play video games?

1323
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:26,760
We eat.

1324
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:32,520
Let's move on into some other gaming headlines, which, you know, kind of along the lines of

1325
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,920
harassment a little bit and social media behavior.

1326
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,480
I don't know.

1327
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:35,980
Loki?

1328
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:38,680
Yeah.

1329
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:47,640
So, of course, we have Phil Spencer saying that he's praising devs for releasing games

1330
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,320
among the culture of cancellation.

1331
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,080
So first, when I read this, like, I wasn't sure if they were talking about, like, you

1332
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:00,520
know, all the different canceled games like Ubisoft and stuff, but they're talking about

1333
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,160
the current culture of criticism and cancellation.

1334
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:09,720
I guess being that indie developers are more likely to just kind of bring their vision

1335
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,480
to fruition and not really care about outside influences.

1336
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,480
Whereas if you have something kind of studio made or something like that, you might get

1337
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,600
a lot more exec kind of influence over stuff.

1338
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:28,120
But basically, we are we all of us here today, all of our teams around the globe, separate

1339
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,320
the 10,000 people that we let go.

1340
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,000
We are all part of creating this echo effect of joy.

1341
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,280
Bravely and intentionally release their visions to the world, particularly in the current

1342
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:45,480
culture of criticism and cancellation, our players who bravely and intentionally carve

1343
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,520
out time for games to invite rest and rejuvenate their lives and business leaders.

1344
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,880
We call upon them and have the courage to protect and nurture this collective joy.

1345
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,080
I think what they're talking about mainly was like some of the more recent games like

1346
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,720
High on Life is a weird game and that they just kind of, you know.

1347
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,200
Let it be weird, I guess.

1348
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,640
I mean, here's the thing.

1349
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,080
I actually don't think Phil Spencer's comments are as terrible as people are making them

1350
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,080
out to be, and maybe I'm giving him too much credit.

1351
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,440
But here's the thing.

1352
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,600
I think like when I was reading this story on some websites, like for I'm just to say

1353
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,120
say what it is like when I was reading the headline on Kotaku, I noticed they changed

1354
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,560
the quote to remove the word criticism and they just put the cancellation.

1355
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,560
And I felt when I was reading that story that they were trying to project like the Hogwarts

1356
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,600
Legacy discussion because that's the ongoing cancellation right now, right?

1357
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,040
They were trying to project that onto Phil Spencer's comments.

1358
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:45,560
But when I read Phil Spencer's comments as a standalone, I more see it in light of the

1359
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,880
story Jamie just talked about and a lot of the crap that developers have to put up with

1360
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:50,760
online.

1361
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,520
And sometimes, yeah, I would actually label some of that like cancellation.

1362
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,360
It's shitty cancellation attempts.

1363
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,920
It's cancellation that's just, you know, and we all know that's a silly word anyway.

1364
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,200
A lot of it is accountability culture and so forth anyway.

1365
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,400
But I digress.

1366
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,760
I don't want to get too far into those.

1367
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:15,160
I just feel like when I was reading a lot of the gaming media's reports on this quote

1368
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,960
that they were projecting something onto it that I don't think Phil, unless Phil Spencer

1369
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:28,120
said like Hogwarts Legacy or like what other, unless he said that, I'm not sure I would

1370
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,000
jump from this to this in that conclusion.

1371
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,720
Maybe I'm wrong.

1372
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,080
Maybe I'm being naive.

1373
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,080
Maybe I'm giving Phil Spencer too much credit.

1374
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,960
I feel like he's earned a little bit of credit from some of the things he's done in this

1375
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:38,460
industry.

1376
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,960
But, you know, and also not everybody always says eloquent things.

1377
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:48,680
I can respect developers and still say, oh boy, did you put your foot in your mouth?

1378
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,080
For example, Naoki Oshida and the comments about Final Fantasy 16.

1379
01:12:53,080 --> 01:13:01,320
I respect the guy a lot, but oof, you know, but I also recognize how much of that is him

1380
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,960
and how much of that is like the Japanese game development industry.

1381
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,400
But that's a whole other Oprah.

1382
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,600
I just think this, you know, I don't know.

1383
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,480
I feel like a different argument is being put on Phil Spencer that I'm not sure he was

1384
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,600
trying to get involved with.

1385
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,160
But that's my thought.

1386
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,240
Anyway, all right, moving on.

1387
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:29,160
Let's talk about Arcade 1UP because, you know, we talk about those machines on this show

1388
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:29,880
a little bit.

1389
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,320
And we also talk about them on our Discord server sometimes because, you know, some of

1390
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,800
these pictures of machines and stuff show up on our Discord.

1391
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,160
Plus, you know, the good old I'm banned from Bobby Black Wolf's arcade because I get high

1392
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,600
scores on his machines.

1393
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,120
This all gets elaborated on with pictures in the Discord and all of that.

1394
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:51,240
So over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1395
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:56,600
This story was actually posted in the Orange Launch Radio channel about did Arcade 1UP

1396
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,560
actually violate an emulator license?

1397
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,280
And it was a link to a Reddit post in the emulation subreddit.

1398
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,200
But it reads this.

1399
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:11,400
The Arcade 1UP Simpsons Bowling Unit is reportedly based on Duck Station, which is a GPL3 licensed

1400
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,600
product project.

1401
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,760
I've looked around and there doesn't appear to be historic versions under any other license.

1402
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,400
They are actively denying requests for the source code, which when the GPL requires for

1403
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,920
them to make it available.

1404
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:27,080
I was also sent similar via DM by someone else who requested the source.

1405
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:31,000
I was told before that Arcade 1UP had cleaned up their act.

1406
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,920
They had previously been caught using non-commercial versions of MAME in their products.

1407
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,160
But based on this, it seems it's not the case.

1408
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,840
Based on what has been said, this is nothing more than another bootleg product claiming

1409
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,720
to be fully licensed.

1410
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,400
Interesting development.

1411
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,200
And by the way, thank you 13X Forever who posted that in our Discord.

1412
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:51,640
But interesting development that came up since that was posted, actually, within the last

1413
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:57,800
couple of days, Arcade 1UP, if you go to their GitHub over at github.com slash Arcade 1UP,

1414
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,000
they have posted the source.

1415
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:07,080
So calling them out, actually, they were in the position where, oops, I guess they were.

1416
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,360
So I guess it is an admission.

1417
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:12,280
Yes, we were using the duck station, which I'm sure it wasn't too hard to figure it out.

1418
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,960
And they posted the source code.

1419
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,480
So here's the completely fair dragging of Arcade 1UP.

1420
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,760
And, you know, obviously that was a little shady what they did and so forth.

1421
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,800
And a lot of people, you know, I've been read sometimes for buying these things because

1422
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,200
it's like, why don't you why don't you mod these things?

1423
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,640
You could get more games in him.

1424
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,000
Or why do you not get the real cabinet or anything like that?

1425
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,280
And it's like, yeah, I will number one, the real cabinets are a bitch to get upstairs.

1426
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,640
And that's where my games are.

1427
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,920
I'm moving a pinball.

1428
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,120
Yeah, it's these work a lot better upstairs.

1429
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,880
Let's let's put that or downstairs in the case of Black Wolf Manor.

1430
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,400
These games get up and downstairs a lot easier.

1431
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,680
But also be I realize they're not the real thing.

1432
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:03,000
They're collectibles, especially this BurgerTime machine is limited edition 3000.

1433
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,040
It is a collectible.

1434
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,600
I like the aesthetic.

1435
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,960
I think these, especially the Tron one with the built in black lights, like it looks really

1436
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:12,600
cool.

1437
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,280
I realize it's not the real thing with the real CRT television, all that.

1438
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:21,240
But you know what, when those machines break, they are a fucking beast to repair because

1439
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,040
no one makes CRT televisions anymore.

1440
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,920
So I find these things as a kind of a happy kind of medium for collecting and so forth.

1441
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,560
So but I want them to follow all the rules.

1442
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,280
Like I don't I understand that a lot of this stuff is going to be emulated in this day

1443
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:36,780
and age.

1444
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:43,320
But emulations come a long way from the days of the earliest main main stuff and all that

1445
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,560
stuff is like, you know, this is when I play this Tron machine, I feel like I'm playing

1446
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:53,640
the old arcade game, save for the joystick is a little less durable than what you'd see

1447
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,600
in the real arcade machine.

1448
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:59,080
But other than that, the game itself, I feel like I'm playing the real game and it's a

1449
01:16:59,080 --> 01:16:59,580
lot of fun.

1450
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,860
I still want the Marvel pinball from arcade one up.

1451
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,580
Even though it's a digital pinball, I still think it would be funny.

1452
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,220
It's still cool.

1453
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:12,860
So Bobby Black Wolf says in the case of Black Wolf Manor, there's no stairs.

1454
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,700
We take them around the house in the basement door.

1455
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,580
That's Oh, that's right.

1456
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:18,060
I forgot you have a back a backyard door.

1457
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:18,380
That's right.

1458
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,980
That's how you get the pinball machines in there.

1459
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:20,700
Of course.

1460
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:21,200
All right.

1461
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,300
Dejirama S says you could get an arcade mini cab with tons of arcade games in it, but that's

1462
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,580
bootleg AF.

1463
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:32,780
And Rama, I'm going to really ruffle feathers with this comment, but that's my opinion.

1464
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:36,780
Most of those cabinets look bootleg as fuck.

1465
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,260
That's why I like these.

1466
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:44,460
To me, especially this Tron one is incredibly faithful to the original, about as close as

1467
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:48,220
you can get when it's three quarters of the size of the old one.

1468
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:52,540
You know, a lot of those other machines, they look like bootleg arcade machines to me.

1469
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,100
That's not to say I'll never get one.

1470
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:59,980
Again, I keep pointing out I have a nice open available space still.

1471
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:01,980
And you know what's funny?

1472
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,820
Alan and I have even talked about like, you know, we don't really use the kitchen table.

1473
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:11,100
And if we got rid of the kitchen table, we'd have more space downstairs.

1474
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:13,260
Rob, what?

1475
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:18,140
Tell me if you remember, we had the dining room table in my house.

1476
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,180
Do you know what's been since put away in favor of pinball tables?

1477
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,380
The dining room table.

1478
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,100
dining room table.

1479
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:29,340
We have we have a smaller kitchen table and even that's a gaming table.

1480
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,860
It's a bumper pool underneath it.

1481
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:35,820
But like, but your house is you and Dan, my house, me and Alan.

1482
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:41,420
How often do we sit down at the dinner table and have dinner with our significant other

1483
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,140
to talk about?

1484
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,580
It doesn't happen.

1485
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,020
We do.

1486
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,380
Well, sometimes we might go out to eat and do that or something.

1487
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,700
Or we might both sit in the living room and chat.

1488
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,380
We don't like sit at the dinner table.

1489
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:53,420
How do you do it?

1490
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,620
You got rid of your dinner table.

1491
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:55,420
You can't do it.

1492
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:57,580
No, we have the we have the kitchen table.

1493
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,900
Oh, yeah, you have your little one that's got the bumper pool in it.

1494
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,340
Yeah, I remember eating pizza there once.

1495
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:02,700
Yeah.

1496
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:06,140
And so we have we have people over and we eat at the table, you know.

1497
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:12,380
But like we were even talking about like, I kind of want to, you know, put that somewhere

1498
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:18,460
else and get like one of those little folding leaf tables that you could just unfold the

1499
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:23,020
one side and then have like a little nook area and then have the rest of the kitchen

1500
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:23,520
open.

1501
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:27,500
I like to our very first house, the house I grew up in, we had a instead of a kitchen

1502
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,060
table, we had an actual like restaurant booth.

1503
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,740
We had a like a booth.

1504
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:32,380
I like that.

1505
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,020
The one thing I don't like about those.

1506
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,540
I'm just just saying is that if someone in the middle has to get up and pee.

1507
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:40,700
Yeah, true.

1508
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:42,240
Yeah.

1509
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,900
And then they're kind of a pain to clean.

1510
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,360
All right.

1511
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:47,260
Anyway, let's move on.

1512
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,500
Uh, following up on something from last week, right?

1513
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,000
Dark soccer.

1514
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:51,760
Yep.

1515
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,920
This makes me actually kind of upset because.

1516
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,160
Bubba is still in dead by daylight.

1517
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:10,800
That code piece was put in the PTB to catch the leaker.

1518
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,360
Oh, wow.

1519
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,280
But there I go.

1520
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,480
My Jennifer Coolidge again.

1521
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,880
I didn't know that that's what it was.

1522
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,560
Oh, I just I just okay.

1523
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,060
I agree.

1524
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,200
It's you still see Steve, Nancy and demo.

1525
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,000
You would have seen Bubba.

1526
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,360
You'd never truly be rid of Bubba.

1527
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,440
Yeah, that was that was the theory is that they would just leave him in, but no one could

1528
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,320
buy him again.

1529
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,120
Like even I was talking when I was playing with Raven early this morning, you know, she

1530
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,160
was even like, I was going to wait for I didn't I don't have Bubba yet.

1531
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,160
I was going to wait for him to go on sale before they got rid of him.

1532
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,280
And now they're not getting rid of him.

1533
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:55,280
But yeah, it was actually posted on the Dead by Daylight Twitter dead by behavior BHVR.

1534
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,880
Yeah, he's not going anywhere with a picture.

1535
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,400
And of course, that picture being here, I'll actually just link the tweet with the photo.

1536
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,920
At least for those in chat, other people, you'll have to look for it.

1537
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,420
Sorry.

1538
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:17,700
It's basically Dwight on a elf Dwight on a hook with a Bubba in the background.

1539
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,460
Ready to go, because face camping Bubbas.

1540
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:28,420
But yeah, they said, nope, he still got business to take care of in the entities realm.

1541
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,460
We'll let you know if a licensed character ever needs to leave us.

1542
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:37,780
But this was, you know, when they did the confirmation with leaks by Daylight.

1543
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:44,500
They they actually said that that they were I mean, they've been very accurate over so many

1544
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,660
things like outfits and whatnot, and collaborations.

1545
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:53,780
Oh, and the person that runs it apparently said that they were just gonna stop posting

1546
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:55,540
content leaks.

1547
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:00,180
Like just basically stick with like the wardrobe stuff or whatever.

1548
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,100
And I'm like, let's just knock it off.

1549
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:14,340
But this is an attempt to try to catch some of the people who were leaking.

1550
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,980
But in this case, I mean, it was actually just PTB data mining.

1551
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:29,380
But there was another thing on here from Reddit, where they said that they,

1552
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:40,900
they said that they gave a comment to a few of the different people they suspected of leaking.

1553
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:47,380
Basically, this was set up like one of those canary traps,

1554
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,300
you know, put the false information out there, find who leaked it.

1555
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:51,860
Interesting.

1556
01:22:52,020 --> 01:23:01,300
Um, so, and then, yeah, I mean, and but there's the one person who said seems like this is the

1557
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:06,580
end of this trip from MGA 9678 on a Reddit discussion.

1558
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:14,660
But I mean, I do kind of agree with what another Reddit user said.

1559
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:18,100
And I'll quote if this brings back some of the excitement and mystery around

1560
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,100
chapter teasers again, that it's not all bad.

1561
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:27,940
Um, but I mean, I like I like seeing this.

1562
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,780
It makes me more excited for it when I get to see the preview of it, you know?

1563
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:32,280
Yeah.

1564
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:40,740
Um, I, I like those things, although I did kind of liked when, when they were teasing

1565
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:51,940
uh, uh, the Hell Priest Cenobite, that they put up the footage in the, um, in, uh, on the TV.

1566
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:58,740
And for anyone who's seen Hellraiser, they know that that's what the precursor

1567
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,180
to, um, the Hell Priest showing up.

1568
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:02,680
Yeah.

1569
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:07,140
Yeah. So I like, or when they did the artist, we were all like,

1570
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,340
like some of us knew right away, oh, that's going to be something you have to do with like artwork

1571
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,060
or something.

1572
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:19,540
And, you know, and even going back to like naming certain artists who had done this kind of work,

1573
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:25,780
it was, I liked, I liked when we had those kinds of teasers and guesswork and to see who was right

1574
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:29,940
and who wasn't and, you know, building up that excitement for it.

1575
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:35,540
But I also did like every so often having someone vindicated or not vindicated, but confirm it for

1576
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,740
me a little early, you know?

1577
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:40,900
I don't think the leaks ever really like hurt anyone or the game.

1578
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,740
Like, you know, the design does that plenty.

1579
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,260
But it broke my heart because I want Bubba gone.

1580
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,940
So people won't stop playing face camping asshole Bubbas.

1581
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,700
He was never going to get fully removed.

1582
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,620
They're not going to be able to take it from people that already bought it.

1583
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,300
Like that would be very challenging.

1584
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:05,140
I still think that they need to implement my idea, patent pending, of, um, having it like,

1585
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:13,060
like for camping killers, having them be pushed out of the area or giving a longer endurance boost,

1586
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,900
not just to the hooked, but to the unhooker.

1587
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,300
I agree.

1588
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:21,460
The hook timer in the post hook endurance timer should be based off of the proximity

1589
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,820
of the killer and how long they stood.

1590
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:28,020
Like if, if the killer stands right next to the hook, it should basically build the hook

1591
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,940
time the longer the killer standing there.

1592
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:37,940
I will say, however, that that has won many a match for people who have been hooked near

1593
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:38,580
the exit gates.

1594
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,580
All right.

1595
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,900
Uh, let's move on.

1596
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:46,740
The hook timer should stop if the killer is not out of the area.

1597
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:47,380
No, I agree.

1598
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,700
All right, let's move on.

1599
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,580
Let's, uh, talk about some more, uh, I guess followups.

1600
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:56,020
Cause I feel like we were talking about this company the other week, but Loki.

1601
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:56,260
Yeah.

1602
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:00,500
We were talking about cancellations by Ubisoft last week and some unknown games and stuff.

1603
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:05,300
One of these, of course, was apparently an online hero battler called Project Q.

1604
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,980
It was one of those three games that got, uh, canceled.

1605
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:12,100
The one we talked about that last week, uh, because they have,

1606
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:16,100
haven't been having a successful year apparently.

1607
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,740
Um, and then confirmed it.

1608
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,060
Yes.

1609
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:24,180
Project Q development team was being reassigned to other endeavors and projects within the studio.

1610
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:29,860
And I guess it was a PvP shooter first announced in April, 2022.

1611
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,620
I don't remember anything about it.

1612
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,700
So neat.

1613
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:41,460
Um, and then of course they still insist that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development.

1614
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:45,540
Duke Nukem forever all over again.

1615
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,180
Yeah, I know.

1616
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:51,140
I wonder how many times it will be great when it comes out.

1617
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:51,620
I'm sure.

1618
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:56,100
I wonder how many times it stopped and started development in that too.

1619
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:56,820
Turned it over.

1620
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,060
Yeah.

1621
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:59,700
It's that happened at least once.

1622
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:04,020
Cause when they started developing that game, they were probably developing it for the PS3.

1623
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:07,140
I think it's been like 15 years now or something.

1624
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:07,380
Yeah.

1625
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,660
15 years.

1626
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:12,820
So I really don't care at this point.

1627
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,700
Just like either release or don't like, I don't care.

1628
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,740
Just, I don't need to be told that it's still in development.

1629
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,380
Or just tell me you canceled it and restarted it.

1630
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,100
You know?

1631
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:22,500
Yeah.

1632
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,260
Just say, hey, we just started development because we had the cancel development.

1633
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,300
Yeah, whatever.

1634
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:34,020
Well, something else that was canceled before it ever started was Walu Peach.

1635
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:35,860
That's right.

1636
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:43,300
It was, uh, I guess Walu Peach was a character that had been pitched, uh, in a tweet.

1637
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:43,700
Let's see.

1638
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:49,780
It was an interview with Shugo Takahashi, uh, about the creation of Waluigi, uh, and

1639
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:52,580
talking about, you know, what was going on with the creation of that.

1640
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:58,100
But apparently, uh, Nintendo was open to other ideas and they, the team tried to pitch Walu

1641
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,860
Peach for the next game.

1642
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:06,260
But Miyamoto said, no, vetoed it even before seeing the design, which I can only imagine

1643
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:08,820
what the design for Walu Peach would have looked like.

1644
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:14,500
But Miyamoto said, I know it's going to be just like Doro and Joe, so don't bother.

1645
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:20,100
Doro and Joe, and I'm probably saying there's Doro and Joe, uh, is an anime villain from

1646
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,060
Yatterman.

1647
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,700
Uh, and so, uh, love Yatterman.

1648
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,060
That's a Tatanoko one.

1649
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:25,300
Yeah.

1650
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:29,860
So Miyamoto was like, no, not even don't even want to see it stop.

1651
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:32,820
So what could have been, what could have been?

1652
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,340
Doro and Joe looks pretty awesome.

1653
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,340
Might be a little too spicy for Nintendo though.

1654
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:39,380
All right.

1655
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:44,260
Well, let's get to, if we're going to talk about classic games, I think now's a good

1656
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,660
time to bring in our next segment.

1657
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,100
So let's get to it.

1658
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:04,340
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1659
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,580
out a classic and tell you about it.

1660
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:09,300
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1661
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,540
And what did you pick for us tonight, Dark Sakura?

1662
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:20,740
The game I am streaming on Saturday night, Star Ocean, as in the original Star Ocean.

1663
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:26,100
It came out in 1996, um, on the Super Famicom.

1664
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,620
It was developed by Tri-Ace and published by Enix.

1665
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,300
Yes, that Enix.

1666
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,940
It is the very first of those games.

1667
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:40,820
It was released July, 1996, and was the first game developed by Tri-Ace that was, uh, mostly

1668
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:45,700
made up of staff that had left Wolf Team being unhappy with the development for Tales of

1669
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,940
Fantasia with Namco in 1995.

1670
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:54,740
It uses a special compression chip to compress and store all the games data, um, because

1671
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:57,620
the graphics in it really pushed the limits of the Super Famicom.

1672
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:03,380
Um, the game also had voice acting for the game's intro and voice clips that played

1673
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:04,980
throughout battle gameplay.

1674
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:16,100
Um, and it, I, it's a really complicated story so far, but it has these three friends who

1675
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:23,460
experience a new disease and they come into contact with, uh, with people from a space

1676
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,580
faring federation.

1677
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,020
Like it almost sounds like Star Trek.

1678
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:26,520
Okay.

1679
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:33,140
Um, and they find a time travel device that lets them go back in time to try to find

1680
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,100
the cure for their planet.

1681
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:44,980
Um, it, it's, it was never released like just outside, only, only in, uh, Japan because

1682
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,860
the American branch closed shortly before the game was finished.

1683
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:54,820
And then they were also doing a little bit more focusing on Nintendo 64 stuff, but the

1684
01:30:54,820 --> 01:31:00,980
game was actually remade by Tose for, uh, the PSP as Star Ocean First Departure.

1685
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:07,700
And, uh, it was released in North America, Europe and Australia, October, 2008.

1686
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:12,660
And then there's a remastered, which is Star Ocean First Departure R for the Switch and

1687
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:15,700
PlayStation 4 that came out in December of 2019.

1688
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:21,140
And it was the start of the entire Star Ocean series, which is six games, three spinoffs

1689
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:22,660
to remake a remaster and a manga.

1690
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:31,460
Um, but going back to the original Star Ocean, it is a top-down RPG.

1691
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:33,700
I'm not seeing anything on the window.

1692
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:35,620
Oh, there it is.

1693
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:36,260
Okay.

1694
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,620
It's a top-down RPG.

1695
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:45,860
Um, and you, you walk around your party as, you know, compressed into one person, interacting

1696
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,500
with players.

1697
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:56,180
Um, and then you have, like, when you're in battle, you're, it's sort of like Secret

1698
01:31:56,180 --> 01:32:01,620
of Mana this way, where you do have a dedicated battle screen and you can control one character

1699
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,660
and the other to have tactics for how they fight.

1700
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:11,300
Um, and, uh, you don't really have like a world map.

1701
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:15,060
You have like a mini map sort of thing, but it's still not much help.

1702
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:20,100
Um, but you can recruit up to eight additional characters to go with you.

1703
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:25,620
Some happen automatically, some depend on actions that you did in the past.

1704
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:31,060
Um, but there are up to 10 characters that are able to be recruited, even though you

1705
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,420
can only recruit eight.

1706
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:38,020
So it does allow some replayability and it has something, you know, it does contribute

1707
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:41,060
to the way the story, uh, plays out.

1708
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:49,460
Um, so, uh, at any rate, um, the combat is that 3D isometric view.

1709
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:56,660
Um, but like I said, you, you have battle strategies that your others use, um, you know,

1710
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:59,700
that are basically AI characters, and then you have your own thing.

1711
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:05,460
Um, you can get special points, uh, called SP from battle and they're used to customize

1712
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,180
your abilities.

1713
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:12,980
So for example, you could give SP to cooking and then you can make food out of just raw

1714
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,420
material that you'll find.

1715
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:22,180
Um, you can have people who can create weapons, um, upgrade items, um, and then individuals

1716
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,900
can have, uh, up to 20 items.

1717
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,700
There's also private actions, which I think are cool.

1718
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:34,100
So like, like for example, and I'm still right at the start, but there's a part when you

1719
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:37,860
first go into the past and your, your team of four is separated.

1720
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:45,620
And so you have the main guy and then the Iria, who is like, uh, the second in command

1721
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:50,580
on the spaceship and she's wearing very futuristic clothes that don't fit the planet.

1722
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:53,060
So the main guy has to go and find clothes for her.

1723
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:58,100
So they actually have one of these private actions right at the beginning where they

1724
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:04,260
discuss, like, do you want to risk me going in or do you want me to just stay here?

1725
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:09,780
And, you know, I said, stay here while I look around, but then, uh, his name is Radix by

1726
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:11,140
the way, R-A-T-I-X.

1727
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:15,940
Um, and then there's other things that you can go on with.

1728
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:19,460
Like, for example, when you're looking for the clothes, you can choose to steal them

1729
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:26,260
off of a clothesline, or you can go into the house and ask a lady if she has extra clothes

1730
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:32,100
for a woman, you know, and even then it's like, make up a story, tell the truth, or,

1731
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,620
you know, you've got all these different, like, yes, no actions.

1732
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:43,860
Um, and then, you know, you build up affinity with the other, uh, party members.

1733
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:51,700
Um, so that, you know, for example, how well you treat them determines how close you are

1734
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,940
with them and it affects the game.

1735
01:34:53,940 --> 01:35:01,300
I mean, we're talking like BioWare levels of, of character interaction in an SNE, in

1736
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:02,420
a Super Famicom game.

1737
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,740
So this game was really ahead of its time.

1738
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,980
It really, really was.

1739
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:15,540
Um, and I don't know why it took me so long to finally play it, but I'm, I'm absolutely

1740
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,900
adoring this game.

1741
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,300
It is in the music is so good.

1742
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,020
It's so good.

1743
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:21,540
And it's so pretty.

1744
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:22,740
Look how pretty this game is.

1745
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:29,620
Well, the podcast listeners can't see it, but you can always look it up or check out

1746
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:30,820
one of Dark Sakura's streams.

1747
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:38,180
Well, and the, the, uh, music for Star Ocean and then the first Departure, uh, remake were

1748
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:40,420
done by, um, Sakuraba Motoye.

1749
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:47,620
Um, the music is on an album that was released, uh, November 1st, 1996 by Sony Records called

1750
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,380
Star Ocean Perfect Sound Collection.

1751
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:57,700
Um, and even some of the, the music that was released with it is sort of like a prog rock

1752
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,100
style.

1753
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:02,580
So I'm kind of down for it and I absolutely want to, um, get it.

1754
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:07,220
In fact, the first Departure remake had a song called Heart that was performed by a music

1755
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:08,980
group called, um, Asunaro.

1756
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:13,620
And, uh, it played with the opening credits on, on that version.

1757
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:20,820
Um, and then there was, uh, a different song on first Departure are called, um, uh, Atarashi

1758
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:29,780
Ippo, which means the first step by, um, Yaichi Keiko, um, of, uh, Shadow of Lathandor.

1759
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:39,540
Um, at any rate, the game sold, uh, approximately 235,000 copies in Japan, um, which is just

1760
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:44,980
over, uh, the 175,000 copies that were just sold in 1996.

1761
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:52,660
Um, it was considered one of the best looking Super Nintendo games ever made in that it,

1762
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:55,380
it still holds up today, which I agree it does hold up.

1763
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:00,100
Um, Famitsu gave the game a 31 out of 40.

1764
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:08,260
Um, uh, for game rankings, it, uh, on the SNES one had, uh, a 93% PSP at 77%.

1765
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:16,020
Um, yeah, the English version really just got kind of good, but not great reviews.

1766
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:23,140
Um, but it was considered one of the best remakes of a Squenix game ever.

1767
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,460
Of course, it was released under Squenix at that time.

1768
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:34,980
Um, but it's, the game itself is so solid and it's, I, I've had so much fun with it

1769
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:37,780
just in the three hours that I've played it, that I,

1770
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:40,900
I'm looking forward to playing it every, every week for you guys.

1771
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:43,460
So that, that's it.

1772
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:47,460
It's, it's Star Ocean published by Enix, created by Tri-Ace.

1773
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:49,700
All right.

1774
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,500
Great pick.

1775
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:53,940
Uh, one that I need to, I, I think I've barely touched this game.

1776
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,900
So this is one I feel like I need to revisit too, but that's it.

1777
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,780
Star Ocean, the classic game of the week.

1778
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:00,900
Great pick.

1779
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:02,580
All right.

1780
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,340
And like I said, super fun.

1781
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:04,740
Yeah.

1782
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:08,180
And a very long game too, if this let's play is any indication.

1783
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,540
It's like 24 parts.

1784
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:12,180
So yeah, it's going to put some hours into that.

1785
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:17,220
It's, it's a lot more dynamic and complex than I thought it was going in.

1786
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:17,720
Yeah.

1787
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,940
So I'm already engaged with it.

1788
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:20,440
Nice.

1789
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:25,140
Some comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1790
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:28,420
Uh, Mishkin says, I still need to get Star Ocean R.

1791
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:32,980
Mike Deff says, I still remember the twist in SO3 with the eyes emoji.

1792
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,660
Not going to say what it is right now.

1793
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:38,900
Uh, Questbuster says, one of the things I appreciated about Tri-Ace was how fun their

1794
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:42,820
combat systems were in their games, like their Star Ocean games to Valkyrie profile.

1795
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,060
All right.

1796
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:50,580
Let's, uh, cover some other headlines, uh, rapidly and some rapid fire news.

1797
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:51,080
Loki.

1798
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:52,340
Yeah.

1799
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:58,580
So apparently, uh, Bruce Stanley, uh, former Naughty Dog employee is unhappy that he is

1800
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:03,300
not credited in the new HBO show for the last of us.

1801
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:08,340
Since he was the game director behind the game on PlayStation three.

1802
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,740
Um, he was also credited though.

1803
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:16,660
Like they had a whole special, um, thanks for him in the last of us part one remake.

1804
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:19,140
Um, but no mention of him on the show.

1805
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:22,660
He did leave Naughty Dog in 2017 though.

1806
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:26,100
Um, but it feels, you know, he should have been credited.

1807
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,540
Probably should have been credited.

1808
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,060
I heard the show is really good though.

1809
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:33,460
I mean, I guess I shouldn't remind people it's on Sunday nights or whatever.

1810
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:34,260
It's all on demand.

1811
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:34,420
Now.

1812
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:36,740
Most people are watching on demand whenever you want.

1813
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:37,060
Yeah.

1814
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:39,620
Um, but I mean, I've heard it's really good.

1815
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:40,980
So yeah.

1816
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:41,480
Yeah.

1817
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:45,220
Uh, more game announcements for PlayStation VR two.

1818
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:50,340
Um, these are going to be some updates for already existing games, including rez.

1819
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:56,100
Infinite is going to be coming, um, on February 22nd.

1820
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:57,140
That's pretty awesome.

1821
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:05,380
Um, and then I saw something about, um, now I don't know, like, if it's necessarily like

1822
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:09,060
going to be a really cool feature or not because they have all the eye tracking stuff, but

1823
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:14,020
for Tetris effect though, I saw that you can actually use your eyes to control when you

1824
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:17,860
go into that focus mode or whatever, which I thought was kind of interesting.

1825
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:21,860
Like if you blink for like two seconds or something like that, it's supposed to like

1826
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:25,380
trigger it or something neat.

1827
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,260
Sounds gimmicky to me, but cool.

1828
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:28,760
Yeah.

1829
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:29,640
Yeah.

1830
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:33,060
Um, so yeah, that's going to be, uh, ported over.

1831
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:38,180
And I think if you had the original that, yeah, players who own the original PlayStation

1832
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,500
four additional be able to upgrade it for, uh, $10.

1833
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,180
Oh, they're not even giving it to you.

1834
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,140
No, Sony got to have that money.

1835
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:52,420
Money on, uh, uh, this is, this is, this is why I said what I said a couple of weeks ago.

1836
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:57,060
I don't think the VR two is set up for success, but you know, and I look, I love rez.

1837
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,100
I love Tetris effect.

1838
01:40:58,100 --> 01:40:59,060
They're great games.

1839
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,820
We already played them.

1840
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:04,580
Like these are not, these are not tent pole titles that are going to move hundreds of

1841
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:06,180
thousands of VR twos.

1842
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:09,380
Well, this is in 4k now at 60 FPS.

1843
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:11,060
I don't remember what the last one was in.

1844
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:16,580
If that was also 4k at 60 FPS, but, uh, this one's going to be in 4k at 60 FPS.

1845
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:21,300
And, um, they have both five, one and seven, one surround sound audio options.

1846
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,540
Pretty sure that was in the last one though.

1847
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:29,380
Um, yeah, I mean, I don't like to see that, but.

1848
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,500
Uh, we'll, we'll see how it goes.

1849
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,940
Um, some comments from chat.

1850
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:37,860
Bobby Black Wolf says these are the indie devs that are having you pay for the upgrade.

1851
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:40,580
GT seven is a free upgrade to PSVR too.

1852
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:42,580
I wouldn't necessarily blame Sony for it.

1853
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:47,460
I just, you know, again, I'm not exactly in a rush to get a VR too.

1854
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:50,580
And again, I love those games, but I can play them on hardware.

1855
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,060
I already have.

1856
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:57,300
And honestly, neither one of those games are that I get the Tetris effect is great in VR,

1857
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:03,220
but it's not, it's not such a colossal step down to play on a, a, a regular traditional

1858
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,340
screen either for me.

1859
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:05,940
Like it's pretty fun though.

1860
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:06,980
I do like rez.

1861
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:07,220
It is.

1862
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:10,740
But again, I think, and also I'm like, okay, look, I love rez.

1863
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:13,620
I look, I am a huge music, Gucci stand.

1864
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,060
I love everything that guy's made.

1865
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,340
I even love 99 night.

1866
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:17,540
Well, I liked it a lot.

1867
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,660
99 nights.

1868
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:19,140
Okay.

1869
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:23,620
Like, but I'm just like, rez has been released.

1870
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:29,780
How many times why was rez area X not its own game.

1871
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:37,860
And considering that the, the, the graphics in rez, like considering what the style of

1872
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:42,740
the graphics in rez are, is really, they're going to be a difference between 10 80 and

1873
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,620
4k.

1874
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:46,580
Like, is it really make that much of a difference?

1875
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:50,820
Area X might, but it's not, yeah, it's not going to be the end all be all.

1876
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:50,980
No.

1877
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:56,340
So, uh, and then, uh, you know, I'm just like, what, what could we get some love for child

1878
01:42:56,340 --> 01:43:00,020
of Eden, which, you know, has kind of been overlooked over the years, uh, you know, which

1879
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:04,420
was the connect game on three 60, but has never really seen a revival like rez has,

1880
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:10,180
or just, I just, I don't understand rez area X was very, very clearly the prototype for

1881
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:12,900
a rez part two or some type of SQL to rez.

1882
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,380
Where's that?

1883
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:14,900
That's what they should have released.

1884
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:19,700
That's you want to get my fucking attention, release that for the VR too.

1885
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:20,980
But I, you know, I understand.

1886
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:24,980
I see the comments in chat rez isn't necessarily exclusive to PlayStation either.

1887
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:29,940
But if Sony would be willing to toss them a little money to make it exclusive or at

1888
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:32,100
least give it that release window or whatever you want to call it.

1889
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,860
I mean, they're looking to purchase companies.

1890
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:35,940
Why can't they throw a little money for an exclusive deal?

1891
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:37,940
I mean, they are already doing it with Spiderman and stuff.

1892
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:42,980
I mean, so I'm gonna, well, Spiderman is also somewhat in-house with Sony, but that's

1893
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:45,700
another, that's the licensing thing.

1894
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:46,260
All right.

1895
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:46,500
All right.

1896
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:47,780
Let's get to dark soccer story.

1897
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:57,700
So Deadpool himself has come forward saying that there's going to be Deadpool in Marvel's

1898
01:43:57,700 --> 01:44:02,820
midnight sons and I can't get over this adorable witch hat that he's wearing.

1899
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:07,060
It just says, stay tuned for more details.

1900
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:12,580
We might have more, I think that that's awesome, but I'm absolutely zero

1901
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,860
surprised that Deadpool is joining the roster.

1902
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:16,360
Yeah.

1903
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:17,620
That'd be fun.

1904
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,860
I just got Wolverine though.

1905
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,660
Well, not yet, but we ran into him.

1906
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,160
Yeah.

1907
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:25,160
All right.

1908
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:29,940
Before I get to my story, let me get to another comment from chat over twitch.tv slash vog

1909
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:30,340
network.

1910
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:33,220
Mike Def says, you know what Mizuguchi game needs to come back?

1911
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:35,220
And that is Meteos.

1912
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:39,780
Granted that was with Sakurai, but still I loved Meteos.

1913
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:40,820
I'm going to be honest though.

1914
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:43,460
Meteos had an Xbox 360 arcade release.

1915
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:46,900
It doesn't work quite as well on controller.

1916
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:50,820
Like it's, it's doable, but there's something about the touch screen and I'm not, I'm not

1917
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:53,300
sure they could do Meteos on a system besides the DS.

1918
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:57,300
I mean, I know the switch has a touch screen, so maybe that they could do something where

1919
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,300
you could play with controller or on the touch screen.

1920
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:05,060
But I, I feel like, I don't know if Meteos fits into any current system, I guess maybe

1921
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:05,560
the switch.

1922
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:08,500
Honestly, I try a mobile version.

1923
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:10,020
I wouldn't be opposed to it.

1924
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:11,540
I think it's a game that could work very well.

1925
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:12,580
But yeah, I loved Meteos.

1926
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:13,700
That game was so cool.

1927
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,380
So we'll see.

1928
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:16,740
Dr.

1929
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:19,140
Cia says, wasn't that the one that had the E3 demo?

1930
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:19,700
Yes, it was.

1931
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,580
You could like download.

1932
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:25,140
I remember downloading the demo from the wifi station and like keeping it on the DS for

1933
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:28,340
like two weeks until it accidentally ran out of battery or something like that.

1934
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:28,980
It was pretty rad.

1935
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:30,040
Yeah.

1936
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:31,300
All right.

1937
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:31,780
Let's see.

1938
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:32,900
I have a quick story too.

1939
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:35,940
And that has to do with, uh, Quirtle.

1940
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:39,780
Jason was referring to this a little bit in the intro tonight, but you know, there's all

1941
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:42,020
these Wordle clones, right?

1942
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:45,140
So some of them have you do multiple words at once.

1943
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:48,900
I guess I think Jason name checked one that was like 32 words at once.

1944
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:52,580
Quirtle, I think was one of the first of these because it was four words at once.

1945
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:58,420
Well, as we know, Wordle ended up getting acquired by the New York Times sometime ago.

1946
01:45:58,420 --> 01:46:02,980
Quirtle has now found a new owner and it's not the New York Times.

1947
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:04,340
It's Merriam Webster.

1948
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:05,620
Yeah.

1949
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:07,220
Like the dictionary.

1950
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:13,940
So if you actually go to Quirtle.com, which is Q U O R D L E.com, it actually goes to

1951
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,220
a, it's a redirect.

1952
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:19,380
Basically redirects you to Merriam Webster.com slash games slash Quirtle.

1953
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:21,140
So kind of interesting, huh?

1954
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:25,620
So, uh, the creator Freddie Meyer sent in a message on the games help tab.

1955
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:28,660
I'm delighted to announce that Quirtle was acquired by Merriam Webster.

1956
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:30,740
I can't think of a better home for this game.

1957
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:32,500
Lots of new features and fun to come.

1958
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,780
So stay tuned.

1959
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:36,020
So interesting.

1960
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:40,180
Nine guesses or fewer to find out four five letter words at once.

1961
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:43,300
It's like playing Wordle, uh, four times all at once.

1962
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:45,300
But it's, I like the multi-word ones.

1963
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:46,420
It's kind of fun.

1964
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:52,500
So, uh, Bobby Blackwell says I play Setacortle, uh, which is 16 words at once and 21 tries.

1965
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,100
That that's the most I've done.

1966
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,620
The most words I've done was in that one.

1967
01:46:56,660 --> 01:47:01,540
Uh, Digirama S, uh, referring to last story says, what's the other puzzle game that came

1968
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,980
out for PSP?

1969
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:07,140
I think it was also by Q entertainment, every extend extra.

1970
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,220
And then there was the Xbox 360 title.

1971
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:11,380
Every step extend extra extreme.

1972
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:14,580
Uh, and those, those games were a lot of fun as well.

1973
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:15,080
Yeah.

1974
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:20,500
I like, uh, God, I had one game of every extend extra extreme going for like over an hour

1975
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:20,740
once.

1976
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:22,900
I mean, it's not a particularly difficult game, but yeah.

1977
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:30,100
SS2100 Matt on the Wordle topic says thoughts on the game show Lingo with RuPaul.

1978
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:31,540
Haven't seen it.

1979
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:32,260
I didn't realize it.

1980
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:34,260
I knew it was coming, but did it debut yet?

1981
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,540
I didn't know it debuted yet.

1982
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:37,380
Yes.

1983
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:43,300
Lingo is a reboot, but I will say, um, uh, RuPaul is a huge step up from the former host

1984
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,300
on the game show network, which was Chuck Woolery.

1985
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:48,260
Uh, and then, um, I'm not sure.

1986
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:51,140
I think the original version goes all the way back to maybe the seventies.

1987
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:55,460
I don't remember who hosted the original original ego, but, um, game show network had a revival

1988
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,900
in the, um, nineties.

1989
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:57,140
Okay.

1990
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:58,100
It's on Paramount plus.

1991
01:47:58,900 --> 01:47:59,940
Makes sense.

1992
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,580
I'm curious.

1993
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:01,380
I'll check it out.

1994
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:07,140
Um, I, I like seeing RuPaul do things that are not just drag race.

1995
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:11,940
So, um, I think a game show host is a great place for RuPaul to be.

1996
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,380
So, uh, I'll check it out.

1997
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:13,620
Yeah.

1998
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:14,900
All right.

1999
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:18,580
Let's talk about some things you can check out a little sooner as we travel around the

2000
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:19,940
world and check out some release dates.

2001
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:21,140
How about in the U S Loki?

2002
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:26,580
Oh, this week we have four spoken on PC and PlayStation five.

2003
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:32,900
Um, hyper dimension, Neptunia sister versus sisters are sisters versus sisters.

01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:26,340
That's it.

2014
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:27,220
All right.

2015
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:30,660
Traveling to Japan, a lot of us similar stuff as well.

2016
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:34,580
I'm sure Disgaea seven on the switch is going to be a very big release this week.

2017
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:37,060
Uh, it sounds like around the world cause we're getting it in the U S too, but it's

2018
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:38,900
also on Japan this week on the switch.

2019
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:43,780
Also summertime rendering another horizon out in Japan this week on the switch story

2020
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:45,460
of seasons, a wonderful life.

2021
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:47,540
I didn't chronicle rising.

2022
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:49,940
Please note that is not the full I had in Chronicles game.

2023
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:54,100
This is another one of those like prequel games or whatever the, the games that lead

2024
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,300
up to I had in Chronicles.

2025
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:58,180
I'm not sure what type of game this is.

2026
01:49:58,180 --> 01:49:59,780
I was trying to guess from the screenshots.

2027
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,540
If it's like an RPG as well, if it's more like action oriented, it looks like it might

2028
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:05,860
be a little more action, uh, in this.

2029
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,780
So that is out in Japan this week.

2030
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:10,100
Is this the one we are actually, did we already have this here?

2031
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:11,060
I think we did.

2032
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:12,740
Was this out on Xbox here?

2033
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,180
Now someone in shadow, I eat in Chronicle rising.

2034
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:18,740
I don't know.

2035
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:19,620
Thank you.

2036
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:22,580
Rama says it's a 2d side scroller action RPG.

2037
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:23,540
It's on game pass.

2038
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:23,700
Okay.

2039
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:24,100
Thank you.

2040
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,780
So it's out on the switch in Japan.

2041
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:28,660
So it just, sometimes things are a little delayed while they get localized.

2042
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:28,900
All right.

2043
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,860
So it's not a different one.

2044
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:31,860
It's the same one we already had here a few months ago.

2045
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:32,360
Got it.

2046
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:38,180
Summertime rendering another horizon also out of the switch Haru kiss in a regular and

2047
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:43,380
limited edition and Dora think the thrilling brain adventures of Nobita.

2048
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:43,780
That's right.

2049
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:45,060
That is also out this week.

2050
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,100
And that is a Dora mon.

2051
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:47,700
That is a, another Dora mon game.

2052
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:51,860
I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like a education game cause it's called think, um,

2053
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:55,780
maybe, but it looks cute, especially if you like Dora mom.

2054
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:57,940
Uh, let's look at the PlayStation five real quick.

2055
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:02,340
A lot of the same stuff such as Disgaea seven summertime rendering another horizon.

2056
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:04,260
I eat in Chronicle rising store.

2057
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:04,820
I'm sorry.

2058
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:05,860
I'm looking at the wrong list.

2059
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:07,220
How did that happen?

2060
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:08,980
Let's try that again.

2061
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:15,540
Uh, in Japan, we do have I eat in Chronicle rising, uh, and go simulator three Disgaea

2062
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:18,020
seven is out on the PlayStation five this week.

2063
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:23,300
Uh, the Witcher three wild hunt, the multi-language, uh, souped up edition that is out as well.

2064
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:30,180
And for spoken on the 24th, a little bit early, but I'm sure that is because that looks like

2065
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:33,140
that's going to be a worldwide release, uh, this week.

2066
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:34,740
This is a pretty big week for games.

2067
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:36,420
What's Europe look like?

2068
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:36,980
Dark soccer.

2069
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,580
Like my unmute button.

2070
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:47,220
Um, not, not, not really super huge.

2071
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:54,740
Um, what we have is on the 24th, we have four spoken for PlayStation risen for PlayStation

2072
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:59,380
and switch PlayStation has world war Z aftermath.

2073
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:01,860
26,000 odd ballers on switch.

2074
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:07,780
Also the Witcher three wild hunt for PlayStation and X-Box dead space in the 27th.

2075
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:10,820
And that's what came up.

2076
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:13,300
All right.

2077
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,900
Pretty, pretty big week for games.

2078
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:17,780
Good way to, um, you know, kick off the year since we're still in January.

2079
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:19,220
I can still say we're kicking off the year.

2080
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:24,660
Uh, let's do a few more stories and then we'll get to your comments and calls and all that

2081
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,820
good stuff in our listener round table.

2082
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,180
But first Loki.

2083
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:29,540
Yeah.

2084
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:35,300
So the question is what happens to all of those stadia exclusive games that were out

2085
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:35,540
there?

2086
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:38,660
Well, we have an answer at least for one of those.

2087
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:44,420
So there's a game called gun sport, which was, I guess, a 2d, uh, volleyball type game

2088
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:45,300
that was a stadium.

2089
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,140
So when I think of volleyball, I think of guns.

2090
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:49,940
Well, it's the sci-fi volleyball game.

2091
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:56,740
So, uh, by Necrosoft and they then later on ended up releasing at least last year, a

2092
01:52:56,900 --> 01:53:01,860
sequel, which is hyper gun sport, and that's been available on multiple platforms, but

2093
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:03,220
one of those being steam.

2094
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:11,140
So what they've decided to do since a CD is shutting down, they made their, um, exclusive

2095
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:12,340
game gun sport.

2096
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:17,220
They allowed you to actually be able to play it through hyper gun sports.

2097
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:23,220
So if you access the beta channel through hyper gun sport, you will have a, you'll be

2098
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:29,300
able to access a version of gun sport, um, an offline version that is being made available

2099
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,180
through that.

2100
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:31,780
So that's cool that you'll be able to do that.

2101
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:36,020
And they said it's because of, um, they care about game preservation.

2102
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:38,660
So they went ahead and made a version of that available.

2103
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:40,980
Pretty cool.

2104
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:41,480
Nice.

2105
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:47,140
Actually, that does remind me to ask our resident, um, stadia power user, uh, dark

2106
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:52,020
Sakura, how, who just made the biggest wamp face.

2107
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:55,140
How was the final day of stadia?

2108
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:56,180
How was the final day?

2109
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:57,780
I decided not to play.

2110
01:53:58,820 --> 01:53:59,320
Really?

2111
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:01,220
I made my break already.

2112
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:03,860
I wasn't going to watch the ship sink.

2113
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,300
That was the night I was playing with you.

2114
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:05,700
Wasn't it?

2115
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,380
Was the last, uh, yeah.

2116
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:12,580
Cause I, I said something like, it was, that was the day before the last, but at the same

2117
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:16,740
time, I was just like, you know, I, I can't, I don't.

2118
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:18,740
I, I made my break.

2119
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:23,860
And on top of that, I didn't want to play any dead by daylight and get like something

2120
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:26,340
that would have been an achievement just to have to do it again.

2121
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:27,460
That would have been a little salt.

2122
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:27,960
Yeah.

2123
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:32,900
So I was just like, you know, I, I made my break.

2124
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:33,620
I'm done.

2125
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:34,180
I'm good.

2126
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:34,500
Okay.

2127
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:34,900
Fair.

2128
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:35,620
Fair.

2129
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:40,660
You know, I saw, but my stream title was RIP stadia.

2130
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:41,160
Okay.

2131
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:41,980
Yeah.

2132
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:47,800
Um, I do, since I know you're on G force now, now, cause I know you tried, what was it?

2133
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,000
Bloober or whatever.

2134
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,500
Boostroid.

2135
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:53,480
Bloober is a team that makes video games like silent hill 2 remakes.

2136
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:56,280
Um, boostroid over, uh, was overseas.

2137
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,440
So I know you were having some lag trouble with that.

2138
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:00,200
So you, you kind of are on G force.

2139
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:03,080
Now I saw an interesting headline about that though.

2140
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:08,280
That, um, I don't know if it was bungee or somebody was helping out destiny two players

2141
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:15,560
on stadia with like a free month of G force to try to transition them over to that platform.

2142
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,880
So this could be Google's loss.

2143
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:19,720
Could be Nvidia's gain at the end of the day.

2144
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:21,000
It seems like it could be interesting.

2145
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:26,280
Especially if, you know, if this droid has, you know, doesn't up their game and get ready

2146
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:32,920
for, you know, an overseas, uh, group, then they're going to be SOL.

2147
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:33,420
Yeah.

2148
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:39,100
I'm kind of surprised that, that bungee didn't go to Microsoft with this.

2149
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:42,140
Cause we know Xbox has a cloud and they can play destiny too.

2150
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:46,460
So it was just, I was a little surprised that they didn't go there, but maybe Nvidia was

2151
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:51,420
really eager to cut the deal because I'm sure when Nvidia saw that stadia was going to help

2152
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:54,860
held, there's probably a lot of people like you, Jamie, that are now checking out Nvidia.

2153
01:55:54,860 --> 01:56:02,300
So Nvidia seeing dollar signs where, uh, stadia, you know, has, has left our world.

2154
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:03,500
So interesting.

2155
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:07,500
All right.

2156
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:11,500
Zen monkey 11 and chat says offline version I'm sold.

2157
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:11,740
Yeah.

2158
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:16,380
That is nice for the, um, you know, exclusive games to get, you know, I'm, I imagine those

2159
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:19,820
exclusive agreements are now Nolan void with the sunsetting of stadia.

2160
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:23,740
So I'm kind of glad that they, uh, well, maybe they're not, maybe that's why they had to

2161
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:26,940
kind of do this a tricky way and embed it within an existing game.

2162
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:32,060
Maybe they wanted to steer clear of any potential, uh, legal issues there.

2163
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:33,180
Hmm.

2164
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:33,580
Anyway.

2165
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:34,540
All right.

2166
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:36,300
Uh, moving on dark Sakura.

2167
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:41,180
Me whale.

2168
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:52,700
Um, there is, uh, some, uh, information about, uh, suicide squad game, uh, coming out where

2169
01:56:52,700 --> 01:57:02,700
they're saying that there is going to be, um, some, uh, a battle pass to, for cosmetics

2170
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:03,260
and whatnot.

2171
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:08,620
Um, not a lot of information about it, but the currencies that were shown in the leaked

2172
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:14,380
image are experience that's used to power up and customize your skill trees.

2173
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:17,100
So they're all unique for each player.

2174
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:24,940
Um, VGC was told that you start off really good and can get ridiculous.

2175
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:29,660
So it's, uh, it's open world.

2176
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:32,460
It's just, the game is suicide squad, kill the justice league, by the way.

2177
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:37,340
Um, and it's from the people that did the Arkham asylum series.

2178
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,180
So I don't know.

2179
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:39,740
It looks fun.

2180
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,220
I don't, I mean, I guess battle pass stuff is okay.

2181
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:50,620
I'm kind of already doing it, uh, fifth dream and chat with an ominous prediction though,

2182
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:53,420
saying, Oh, Avengers again, we saw where that went.

2183
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:58,620
So, Hmm, hopefully they play this a little smarter.

2184
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:01,900
Second player games don't need a battle pass.

2185
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:06,300
Saying, all right.

2186
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,380
I'm moving on Loki.

2187
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,100
How about another game with a battle pass?

2188
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:13,980
At least this is an online game.

2189
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,100
At least it's free to play now.

2190
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:15,820
It's free to play now.

2191
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,100
It's free to play.

2192
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:17,820
So yes.

2193
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:27,900
Um, some of the pro overwatch teams are apparently look seeking legal, um, help to sue, um,

2194
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:33,180
Activision blizzard over the losses that they're making from, um, you know, not being able

2195
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:35,180
to participate in these overwatch leagues.

2196
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:41,580
So, uh, apparently there's a majority of the Overwatch league, uh, league teams are working

2197
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:46,620
with a British law firm for a collective bargaining process against the event organizers

2198
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:52,860
after years of high operating costs and continually missing promises on a rep of news.

2199
01:58:52,860 --> 01:59:02,140
So, um, they're saying that they're seeking, uh, somewhere between 7.5 and 10 million in

2200
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:03,500
franchise payouts.

2201
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:08,380
So that's a lot of money.

2202
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:13,260
I guess we'll have to wait and see if they actually, um, end up suing or not.

2203
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:15,420
I'm sure there'll be big news if they end up doing that.

2204
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:16,380
Yeah, that would be huge.

2205
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:20,220
But I just over Overwatch league, like doesn't have a broadcast partner right now.

2206
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:25,180
And you know, this is the time when like this, the fire is supposed to be hot with overwatch

2207
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:26,460
with overwatch two and everything.

2208
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:32,380
It's just like, this is, you know, a lot of people really invested a lot to make overwatch

2209
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:33,100
league happen.

2210
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:37,740
So it's, um, this is, this could, I don't know, this doesn't bode well.

2211
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:40,380
I hope, uh, I hope Activision is able to figure this out.

2212
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:42,300
Yeah.

2213
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:42,540
Yeah.

2214
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:44,140
It's not bode well.

2215
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:48,220
Phil of nine and chat says, overwatch might just be over.

2216
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:53,260
Well, I mean, the overwatch league, uh, which would be hugely detrimental to the industry.

2217
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:57,500
There's a lot of people involved in the overwatch league, a lot, you know, it's like a sports

2218
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:57,660
league.

2219
01:59:57,660 --> 02:00:01,660
It's an entire sports league going under if that I'm not, you know, maybe I'm, I don't

2220
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:04,460
mean to be too, uh, you know, I don't know.

2221
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:07,580
I mean, I don't mean to blow up the issue too much, but it's, it is an issue.

2222
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:11,580
You know, to, to the longevity of the, the, the league.

2223
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:14,700
I think the game itself is fine.

2224
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:18,540
I think enough people are playing it, but you know, I'm also not Activision Blizzard.

2225
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:24,060
So anyway, last story for tonight.

2226
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:29,420
This one is, uh, interesting, but it's, uh, talks about a little bit of a Popeye crossover

2227
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:30,380
in donkey Kong.

2228
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:36,460
It's not quite what you think, but it's a little piece of Nintendo history because apparently

2229
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:41,180
in the original design documents for the donkey Kong game, when we can actually see

2230
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:46,860
what some of those look like this week, we actually see Popeye in some of the design

2231
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:48,220
documents for this.

2232
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:53,980
So, um, uh, Nintendo was going to use the Popeye license for basically what ended up

2233
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:59,900
being donkey Kong because donkey Kong would have been a Bluto, uh, jump man or Mario would

2234
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:02,300
have been Popeye, you know, and so forth.

2235
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:07,260
Uh, and olive oil instead of Pauline, you know where I'm going with this, but then obviously

2236
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:08,940
it all became donkey Kong.

2237
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:13,580
So even though, you know, uh, they didn't get to use Popeye for this.

2238
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:17,820
This is weird though, because Nintendo did end up making a Popeye game, but I think they

2239
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:23,260
were, maybe they got the license later or something, or maybe because of the success

2240
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:27,420
of donkey Congress, I distinctly remember there being a Nintendo, at least in the arcades

2241
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:32,700
anyway, published game that I think then trickled down to all the home systems.

2242
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:35,900
Cause I know I had it on Commodore 64 and it was on Atari version.

2243
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:37,820
It was an early Nintendo release too.

2244
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:42,220
So it might've been the success of donkey Kong that led to this, but yeah, originally,

2245
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:46,860
if you didn't know donkey Kong was designed with Popeye in mind and these design documents

2246
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:47,360
prove it.

2247
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:53,340
So that's all just a cute little, isn't that interesting sort of thing and piece of gaming

2248
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:54,780
history in that.

2249
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:56,700
So there you go.

2250
02:01:58,140 --> 02:01:58,540
All right.

2251
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:04,940
DJ Rama S says the Popeye game was a port that they published, but they did the arcade

2252
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:05,900
version, didn't they?

2253
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:13,100
I thought that was now I have to look it up because this is going to bother me if I don't.

2254
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:13,820
Yeah.

2255
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:17,580
Popeye was 1982 platform game developed and released by Nintendo.

2256
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:23,580
And then the game was licensed by Atari for the UK and Ireland and Nintendo ported it

2257
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:27,420
to the Famicom while Parker brothers did all the others and Parker brothers was huge

2258
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:30,860
in video games and importing everything back in the day.

2259
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:34,060
So yeah, that was an, it was by Nintendo R and D one.

2260
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:38,220
So Miyamoto actually was part of the design for this.

2261
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:43,660
The Popeye characters were originally slated for donkey Kong, but Nintendo was unable to

2262
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:45,020
license the characters at the time.

2263
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:47,340
So basically it was no, you're fine, Rama.

2264
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:50,220
I'm glad we're doing a research and getting this all together.

2265
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:54,460
So I guess you could say because of the success of donkey Kong, or maybe just a timing thing,

2266
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:58,140
they were able to get Popeye and do a different game with that, which was fine.

2267
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:00,380
I thought the Popeye game was fine for its day.

2268
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:02,540
You know, the different types of levels.

2269
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:08,700
They're actually, there's a, there's a lot of interesting parallels to donkey Kong actually

2270
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:11,260
in the early Popeye games.

2271
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:13,420
So pretty neat.

2272
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:14,540
All right.

2273
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:16,780
Let's go to the list around table.

2274
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:21,420
We invite your feedback every week on the show via our mailbag, uh, through discord.

2275
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:25,820
If you want to join our green room over at, uh, vog network.com slash discord.

2276
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:29,340
And of course our chat room, if you have any random questions you'd like to ask us in chat,

2277
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:33,180
cause we haven't had enough tangents tonight, twitch.tv slash vog network.

2278
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:36,620
I don't think I saw emails, but let me check with dark Sakura.

2279
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:37,580
I didn't think so.

2280
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:41,340
If you want to change this very disturbing trend, I don't think we've had an email in

2281
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:42,140
like six weeks.

2282
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:43,820
We'll just blame the holidays.

2283
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:48,860
Participate at orange launch radio.com is the place to send an email if you would like.

2284
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:54,460
So, uh, while I wait and see if anybody in chat wants to ask a question or join us on

2285
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:57,500
discord, let me hop over to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

2286
02:03:58,060 --> 02:03:59,900
Well, there is something I wanted to talk about.

2287
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:05,980
It is a brand new DLC coming out for, um, power wash simulator.

2288
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:12,780
So on the 31st of this month, they're going to have a crossover with tomb Raider and you'll,

2289
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:15,900
you'll be able to wash the lowercroft mansion.

2290
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:17,820
It's gonna be huge.

2291
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:18,780
Oh God.

2292
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:20,300
That's, that's pretty awesome though.

2293
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:21,020
I like that.

2294
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:21,520
Yeah.

2295
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:27,500
I did play a little power wash simulator this week actually, because, uh, I, I played the

2296
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:31,260
one on steam and now I'm playing the Xbox one to get achievements.

2297
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:33,820
And plus it's kind of like starting over too.

2298
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:37,340
Cause like now the official releases out and everything, you know, when I was playing it

2299
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:41,580
before it was still in beta, but power wash is still a very fun, just chill.

2300
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:46,460
I'm just going to wash these rocks type of game.

2301
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:48,000
Yep.

2302
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:52,220
Finara in chat says, will someone play power wash with me?

2303
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:54,700
It sounds like I need to do a stream.

2304
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,340
Is it cross?

2305
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:57,260
I imagine Finara has it on stream.

2306
02:04:57,260 --> 02:04:58,060
Is it cross platform?

2307
02:04:58,060 --> 02:04:58,460
It is.

2308
02:04:58,460 --> 02:04:59,180
It is cross.

2309
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:01,340
You can do a cross platform mode.

2310
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:05,340
Um, and then you can also do like, uh, multiplayer.

2311
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:09,660
I think if you do like campaign, it's only two player co-op, but outside of that, you

2312
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,380
can do more than that.

2313
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:11,420
I think that's maybe eight.

2314
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:14,780
Maybe we need to do a VOG power washing night.

2315
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:19,020
Maybe times.

2316
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:19,580
That'd be fun.

2317
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:25,180
Um, Bobby Blackwell says AGDQ did a six player stream.

2318
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:30,460
I didn't realize it went up to, I thought they did a, um, they did one with, uh, they

2319
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:32,860
did all the vehicles in the game.

2320
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:35,020
So that was pretty neat.

2321
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:36,720
Nice.

2322
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:40,060
All right.

2323
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:41,260
Anything else to share here?

2324
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:42,140
Last minute stories.

2325
02:05:43,420 --> 02:05:45,260
Oh, it's all I had.

2326
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:45,760
That's it.

2327
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:47,260
All right.

2328
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:50,780
Well, I think we believe it or not have come to the end of the show.

2329
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,500
So thank you so much for your participation.

2330
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:54,860
I, it was a little, it's weird.

2331
02:05:54,860 --> 02:05:59,180
We're in a, I mean, it's a big release week for games, but, um, you know, not a huge,

2332
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:00,220
huge story week.

2333
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:02,860
I think we still have a little ways to go before we start really getting the stories

2334
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:03,660
rolling in.

2335
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:07,900
I think a lot of the early parts of this year are probably going to be a ramp up to a lot

2336
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,180
of big releases this summer.

2337
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:13,900
It's going to be a very interesting summer and a very interesting E3.

2338
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:20,300
I mean, but I realize E3 is back this year, supposedly, but that whole, you know, summertime

2339
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:21,180
is gonna be very interesting.

2340
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:22,700
It's gonna be very interesting year this year.

2341
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:23,980
I'm excited to see what comes of it.

2342
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:25,340
All right.

2343
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:27,660
Well, um, that brings us towards the end of another show.

2344
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:30,700
I want to thank everybody for being here for another episode of orange launch radio.

2345
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:32,940
Thank you as always for your participation with the show.

2346
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:37,340
Thank you to the live folks, especially for your generosity tonight.

2347
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:40,380
As you are listening live, I really, really appreciate all of you.

2348
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:43,500
Um, I really appreciate all of you that listen on the podcast feed as well.

2349
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:45,660
I know we have a lot of lurkers who've never said hi.

2350
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:50,300
I'm going to say hi to you anyway, then to say thank you for being here and listening

2351
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:50,860
to the show.

2352
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:53,340
Please feel free to drop us an email and let us know you're out there.

2353
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:56,140
Um, participate at orange on traded.com.

2354
02:06:56,700 --> 02:07:01,580
You can also send us a tweet if you want at OLR, although I can't really be asked to check

2355
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:05,180
Twitter, but once in a while I'll be like, oh yeah, I should check the OLR Twitter literally

2356
02:07:05,180 --> 02:07:05,980
once every other week.

2357
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:07,740
I'm like, oh, I guess I should check that.

2358
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:09,820
So, uh, at some point I'll see your message.

2359
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:14,380
Uh, and uh, yeah, you can also join us live on a Sunday night, all great ways, but if

2360
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:18,460
you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two or seven

2361
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:18,940
about the show.

2362
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:21,980
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

2363
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:24,540
need more voices here to put out on air.

2364
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:29,820
A nice five star review wherever you found this show, like iTunes, Spotify, wherever,

2365
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:32,940
uh, it all goes a very long way and we appreciate those as well.

2366
02:07:33,580 --> 02:07:38,220
With that all being said, I think we will get to final thoughts, dark Sakura.

2367
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:42,940
I'm imagining as usual, you will go play some Debbie delight after the show.

2368
02:07:42,940 --> 02:07:45,500
So, um, let me get your final thought first.

2369
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:52,220
I finally have gotten back to work on my merch store and I will be doing the same for, uh,

2370
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,020
orange lounge.

2371
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:53,900
Yay.

2372
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:58,220
That'll be great because I'd love to get some merch back out there, uh, for fog too, but

2373
02:07:58,220 --> 02:07:58,460
yeah.

2374
02:07:58,460 --> 02:07:59,500
Or are part of that.

2375
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:01,020
And you know what I mean?

2376
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:02,380
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2377
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:03,660
The universe, the universe.

2378
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:08,220
I'm going to be ordering a sample of some stuff once I get more stuff pulled up and

2379
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:09,900
let y'all know what it's like.

2380
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:14,780
But yeah, um, uh, if anyone wants to see what I've done so far, just ask me.

2381
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:15,820
That was great.

2382
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:17,100
All right.

2383
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:18,460
Have a good stream later.

2384
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:19,580
All right, Loki.

2385
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:20,460
That means we go to you.

2386
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:21,580
Your final thought for tonight?

2387
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:30,300
Uh, I hope this week is better than the last week because work is stressful and I don't

2388
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:31,180
want to do it anymore.

2389
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:32,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

2390
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:33,660
Hope it gets better.

2391
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:38,540
It's just, you know, it's, it's, it's like what we talk about in the gaming industry.

2392
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:41,420
It's leadership and bad decisions that they make.

2393
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,100
So yeah.

2394
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:44,300
Let's see.

2395
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:46,460
And my final thought tonight.

2396
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:47,500
I'm with Mike Deft.

2397
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:51,100
We're at least getting soon to Theatrhythms release in a few weeks.

2398
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:51,980
That is exciting.

2399
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:53,100
That is some good news.

2400
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:54,780
That's some good news to end on tonight.

2401
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:56,380
So that's, that's the end.

2402
02:08:56,380 --> 02:09:02,060
Just in the, in general, I need to pick up some other games from my backlog and get to

2403
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:02,860
it already.

2404
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:07,740
But, um, isn't that always the story, how it goes, but darn that real life for continuously

2405
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:08,620
getting in the way.

2406
02:09:08,620 --> 02:09:12,220
But I'm always glad as always, if nothing else, we set aside these times on Sunday night

2407
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:14,060
to hang out and do our thing.

2408
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:18,460
And, uh, as we have for years and years, and I appreciate all of you for being a part of

2409
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:21,980
it, and we will see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio in seven days.

2410
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:23,020
