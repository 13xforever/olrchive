00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Act of Blizz King acquisition is another hurdle, another day into the Surf Code League, Layoffs, Layoffs, New TV Shows, New Arcade 1up, Fish Mischief, as the Federal Reserve attempts to manufacture a recession, Spicy, Microsoft News, Everyone Heard About, Splatfest, Delayed Cuz of the Lore, This ensures Mumblecore and a bit of How the Sausage is Made,

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,280
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki to tell you about the very welcoming week of gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,040
Rob Roberts is joined every Sunday night as we broadcast with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

4
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,800
Hello. Hello. How are you, my friend?

5
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,360
Alright.

6
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,160
Yeah. Just just okay. Just alright.

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,280
I have a little bit of a headache.

8
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,160
I mean, it's it's the I'm going back to work on Wednesday.

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,840
Yeah.

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,480
And I don't know how I how I feel.

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,200
Yeah. Well, yeah, it's understandable.

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,080
I bet your co-workers miss you, though, except are you going back in person?

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,600
I can't remember if you go to the office.

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,280
Two days a week.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,120
Okay. Okay. So some some. Okay.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,880
Yeah.

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,640
Gotcha.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,200
Out of, you know, my four days.

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,360
And I know that like the first two days I get there are going to be, hey, do all your training.

21
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,120
Hey, look how much email you have.

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,720
Oh, guess what?

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,440
You have to upgrade your OS on two computers.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040
That's the worst part about taking any time off.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,120
You can take a day off and it's like the email mountain you come back to is always absurd.

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,920
And thankfully, like 90 percent of it is stuff that I can delete.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
It's just.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,840
I set up mail rules and they don't always work, and I'll leave it at that.

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha.

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,520
All right. Let's also say hello, of course, to the one and only tech master, Loki.

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,040
Oh, hi, Loki. How are you?

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
All right. Catch in the cold, but I'm all right.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,960
Oh, no, I hope it's only a cold.

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
Let it go. You shouldn't catch it.

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,720
Yeah, let it go. Let it run free.

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,960
What is that that's playing behind you tonight?

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,080
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,840
geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,560
And as we tape live, you can see video of us doing this show.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
But of course, everything is always in the audio form for you.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,880
Find folks that listen through a podcast app such as Spotify, iTunes, whatever.

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,280
Amazon Music, I think, does them now.

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,960
Wherever you listen to podcasts, we're there.

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,880
And but if you are watching live, you get to see some video, including whatever this is that Matt is

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,160
playing that I can't tell what this is.

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,000
It looks like a scary game of some sort because I think it's not.

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,960
Oh, it looks like something scary is about to happen there.

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,360
No, no, it's it's Bone Lab.

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,560
It's it's a VR game by stress level zero.

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
It's their sequel.

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,400
It's a pretty cutting edge VR game that I need to play.

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,200
I have it and I have my VR in a box, like

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Oculus, Rift S in a box and stuff.

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,600
So I know I don't think it's too scary.

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,160
There's skeletons, I guess.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,160
OK, well, as I said, a little scene that was played behind you look kind of freaky, but a little trickery for some crowds.

57
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,400
Yeah, well, it's it's just I don't know.

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,520
I think you go through I don't remember the exact premise of the game.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,760
I think you go through like different modules or whatever.

60
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
There are different time periods.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Oh, like quantum leap.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,080
Sort of like it looks like you're kind of like being treated like a witch here

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,680
and then you fall into a dungeon, you fight, you know.

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,240
Skeletons, and then there's another one, you fight like robots and stuff.

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,720
Can I ask a completely fucking random question?

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,520
This is Orange Lounge Radio, right?

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,480
And we don't have a lot.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,680
The news this week was a little bit shorter.

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,760
We can get on a tangent once in a while, right?

70
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,040
Especially if it has to do with a video game or in this case.

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
Why isn't there this video game?

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,960
And my question is, why don't we have a quantum leap video game?

73
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,760
How has that never happened over the years?

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm talking either because they just relaunched it, right?

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,080
There's a newer version, right?

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,040
It doesn't have the same actors.

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,360
Well, one of them passed away.

78
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,040
But it's it's from what I understand is a completely passable version of the show.

79
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,240
It's not terrible, like a lot of reboots.

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,440
Sounds like NBC is actually kind of getting the reboot thing

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,480
because I hear the Night Court one is pretty good, too.

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,200
But I understand why Night Court's not a video game.

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
I don't understand why Quantum Leap isn't a video game.

84
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,760
Or am I missing something from the 80s or 90s?

85
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Was there an obscure game I just didn't know about?

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,400
Because I know a lot of TV like Star Trek Next Generation had a Super Nintendo game.

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,520
There was a lot of stuff that had video game.

88
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,640
I don't remember Quantum Leap ever having a video game.

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,320
No, I don't think it did, but I don't know what that would be.

90
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,360
Well, like you're like you're talking about.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,640
You're hopping into different bodies and solving different adventures like the show.

92
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,000
Maybe they could actually do an ending that fucking doesn't just end

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,560
like the original show did, you know?

94
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,640
Looking in chat, Darticia says,

95
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,440
Alright, also, I hear the sequel got another season.

96
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,240
Yeah, I heard that, too.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,720
That's kind of one reason I bring it up is that, you know,

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,720
a lot of those revivals of old shows, some of well, I shouldn't say a lot of them.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,920
Some of actually quite a few of them have done very well.

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,840
The Roseanne without Roseanne is like still going.

101
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,280
There's the Will and Grace was on for several seasons there.

102
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,480
There's a lot of shows that come back and they do pretty well.

103
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,520
But yeah, Fifth Dream says too much plot, not enough action.

104
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,760
Maybe Questbuster with the suggestion

105
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,320
a scum like adventure based on Quantum Leap would be neat.

106
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,920
Now you're talking now you're talking like a more text based, not text based,

107
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,080
but, you know, old school 90s PC, King's Quest, LucasArts, RPG in Quantum Leap.

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Hell yeah. Now now we're talking.

109
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,880
Let fucking not telltale games, but I guess they are telltale games again.

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,120
But the people that are making games

111
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,120
like the old telltale games, let them do a Quantum Leap game.

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,080
Hell yeah. I'd rather see that than Jurassic Park.

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,600
Anyway, I don't know.

114
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,360
I'll take I'll take a scum based Seinfeld game

115
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,320
because I already know that someone's made that concept and it looked hilarious.

116
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,840
Bobby Black Wolf with the realistic answer saying licensing, which, yeah,

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,000
but, you know, NBC, NBC, Comcast, Universal should license more of their stuff.

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
Isn't Jurassic Park or Universal?

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,480
I guess it's based on a book, though, so maybe that one end up a little different.

120
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,840
But hell, if you if you were to open that up, you could have a saved

121
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,040
by the Bell video game you could have.

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
You can have all sorts of things.

123
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,760
Anyway, I mean, they made a high school musical game, so why not?

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,600
Why not? Exactly. That's exactly my point.

125
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,480
If these crappy things can have video games, why can't Quantum Leap?

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,840
Tigerclaw points out there was an article on Eurogamer in 2021

127
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,320
that says someone should make a game about Quantum Leap.

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,680
Well, somebody and I over on that website are on the same wavelength then.

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,720
All right. Let's talk about the games we know are coming out or in some cases

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,080
did come out. Let's talk a little bit about that Microsoft developer direct

131
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,160
that's kind of taken over the headlines this week as our first topic for tonight.

132
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Loki, do you want to talk about this? Did you watch it?

133
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,880
I must admit, I was able to watch it.

134
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Just a quick aside.

135
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,600
My dad had surgery this week, and although it went well,

136
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,720
there was a complication that caused us to go to the ER that same night.

137
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,680
He's fine. Everything is is but it's just it was a bumpy road to get there.

138
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,680
So my point is I was a little removed from some of this this week

139
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,840
and I didn't watch this live.

140
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,920
I didn't really do catching up on gaming news

141
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,760
until the weekend with other stuff going on.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,520
I'm sure you all can understand no one's going to fault me.

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,720
But just to put that in perspective, so I didn't watch this live.

144
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,560
I just kind of caught up on the cliff notes.

145
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm I'm not sure if I'm assuming Jamie doesn't usually watch

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,400
the Microsoft stuff live, but Loki, I don't know if you did.

147
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,600
I didn't watch it live.

148
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,400
I knew it was coming and I forgot what time it was on.

149
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,360
I watched it after part of it after the fact.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
Only the beginning of it.

151
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,200
So they showed off.

152
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,120
Was it a new trailer?

153
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
It was kind of boring.

154
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,120
It was really boring.

155
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,440
At least this trailer was for Minecraft Legends showing off

156
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,280
the the PvP 4v4 mode that they have, which.

157
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,040
May. OK, cool.

158
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,800
So there's that.

159
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,120
And then they announced the date that's coming out, which is April 18th.

160
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
So it'll be part of Game Pass.

161
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,680
That's probably going to be the way I'll check it out.

162
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,320
I'm not buying that it.

163
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,880
Like I said, this has the Fallout 76

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,320
feel to me, the more you wait.

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,840
No, actually, it wasn't Fallout 76 Elder Scrolls Online.

166
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,240
It was the more I saw of that game, the less I wanted to play it.

167
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,840
And the same with Minecraft Legends.

168
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,360
The more I see of this, the less I want to play it.

169
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,840
It just doesn't look interesting.

170
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,920
They had a little bit of a kind of

171
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,280
preview of Forza Motorsports,

172
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,400
which is, I guess, you know, kind of

173
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,800
not incrementing the numbers anymore, kind of rebooting, I guess, if you will.

174
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,520
And looks cool.

175
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,120
They've, you know, really stepping up like the different physics

176
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,600
as far as like paint and even just the, you know,

177
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
car physics themselves and the damage models, dirt accumulation,

178
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,240
like, you know, all that like intricate stuff that's just like

179
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,680
way too detailed.

180
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,320
But, you know, at this point, like the cars look like cars.

181
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,600
You got to get to that in unnecessary detail.

182
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,160
IRL stuff we take for granted.

183
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,400
I know. Why is like realistic dirt so funny to me?

184
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't know why.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,600
If I want to see like blood, you know,

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,960
bug splat physics and stuff like that, that's what they need to do in there.

187
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,080
You know what would be funnier is like, I would love to see something like this,

188
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,880
but like from like, say, a Cruzan USA game, you know, like,

189
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,600
you know, just a ridiculous thing because Cruzan is just absolutely unrealistic.

190
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,720
But they could talk about the physics of like the deer exploding

191
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,320
when you hit it and stuff like that.

192
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
We've made the Gibbs that much more

193
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,800
so much more fidelity.

194
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
He's some spy. What was that?

195
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
What was that super realistic?

196
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,400
Carmageddon, was that what it was called?

197
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,840
The one that ended up on a congressman watch list and things like that.

198
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,600
That's what you want.

199
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,360
You want Carmageddon or something like that, don't you want a Carmageddon?

200
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,520
But it's like, I think it would be funny to have like one of these games

201
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,800
that's just like absolutely the total opposite side of the spectrum,

202
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,120
like putting out a video like this, talking about the details.

203
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,840
It's just like it'd be funny.

204
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,000
But yeah, it looks really cool.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,440
Sick, very sick.

206
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,560
They said it was at 20 tracks, 50 cars,

207
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,000
800 different upgrades to those cars, something that.

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,720
And then they showed off a brand new kind of a surprise game

209
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,840
called Hi-Fi Rush, which was a rhythm focus character action game,

210
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,720
kind of looked reminded me a little bit of Sunset Overdrive.

211
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,480
And that was a thing that actually I believe came out that day.

212
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,880
It sure did.

213
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,280
So that that looked pretty cool.

214
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,680
They talked a little bit about actually, can we go back to Hi-Fi Rush

215
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,960
for a minute, because I actually played it a little bit.

216
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,920
So it's it's pretty cool.

217
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,440
It reminds me a little bit of like, I know a lot of people were

218
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,040
comparing it to Jet Set Radio Future because of the art style

219
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,480
and the fact that it's a music game.

220
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,440
But the way it plays is not like that at all.

221
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,240
I would call it Beatenetta because it's like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry,

222
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
but with rewards for beat matching,

223
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,000
which also is not particularly unique to a game.

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,280
I want to say it's very I want to say this game was probably when they

225
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,360
when they came up with coming up with this game or whatever.

226
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,280
They were probably like, what if we did Crypt of the Necro Dancer?

227
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
But we did it like Devil May Cry.

228
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,640
And that's where this game came from, pretty much.

229
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,000
But it's it's I mean, especially for a surprise release with no buildup.

230
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,600
I love the art style in it is so, so good.

231
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,560
And it actually it has a really good sense of humor.

232
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,360
Like the voice acting in the game is really good.

233
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,840
And it's got like a really like cute, funny plot to it.

234
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,680
So, yeah, I'm I'm like super into this game.

235
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,400
And it was it's for a stealth release.

236
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,480
It's great.

237
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,160
So it's definitely worth a look if you're like on Game Pass or whatever.

238
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,760
And I'm glad because I know a lot of people kind of been talking about

239
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,160
how like Game Pass is like not had stuff to look forward to

240
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,480
or whatever for the past few months, you know,

241
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
because they've been removing my Steam wish list.

242
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,920
Yeah, but this this game is great.

243
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,640
I think I think you might like this Dark Sakura.

244
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,440
I think you would.

245
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,640
Well, no, it's like I said, it's been on my Steam wish list for a while.

246
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
What? This game?

247
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
It just came out this week.

248
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
No, it just came out this week with no fanfare.

249
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,640
No, there was a Steam thing on there.

250
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,160
Hold on. Maybe I'm thinking of a different one with similar graphics.

251
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,880
It did come out on Steam, but there was no fanfare for this.

252
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,280
They literally announced it on Wednesday or whatever.

253
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,560
And they were like, it's out today.

254
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,000
This game has been on my Steam wish list, not Xbox.

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Nothing having to do with it.

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,560
Just that I think it looks like a good game and it's on my wish list.

257
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,880
Oh, yeah. No, that's what I was saying.

258
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,840
Gotcha. I thought you said it had been on it.

259
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,320
Like I was like, wait, but it's only been out. I got it.

260
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,280
But yeah, I mean, the game is a lot of fun.

261
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,800
And the licensed music, like it has like Nine Inch Nails,

262
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,040
Perfect Drug, which is really cool. Love that song.

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,080
You know, it's just lots of neat stuff in it.

264
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,560
And I thought it was very smart.

265
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,000
They did a streamer friendly mode for the game to encourage people to stream it.

266
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,640
Everybody knows because this game is a like shadow drop release,

267
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,360
basically unannounced comes out of nowhere.

268
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,360
In fact, I noticed that the icon on my desktop to launch

269
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,400
the game is still called Hibiki, which is not the name of the game.

270
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,600
It's called Hi-Fi Rush.

271
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
So I think this game was such a shadow drop with little fanfare.

272
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,880
They accidentally left the project name or the code name in the files.

273
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

274
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,520
It was a different game on my wish list.

275
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,640
OK, OK.

276
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,920
Bomb Rush Cyber Funk, which is like a Jet Set Radio clone.

277
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,240
Oh, interesting. Yeah. Hmm.

278
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
But but yeah.

279
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,600
So Hi-Fi Rush, I absolutely would say, I mean, if you have Game Pass,

280
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,280
this was a great little thing to sweeten the pot with this this week, that's for sure.

281
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,520
Let's see. And oh, Mike Deft thought of it in chat, too.

282
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,720
I was just looking at the chat here, catching up a little bit.

283
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,560
Dr. T in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says,

284
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,800
I was loving Hi-Fi Rush for the most part.

285
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,560
Then I hit a wall on one of the rhythm based sections.

286
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,160
I wonder, I actually don't know the answer to this.

287
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,200
Can you tone down the difficulty in the middle of it?

288
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,960
Because I'm playing on normal,

289
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,720
but I'm willing to drop it down to easy if I need to clear a section.

290
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,600
So I'm not I'm not sure.

291
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,160
Maybe so.

292
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,680
And SSG100 Matt does point out the ever important.

293
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,240
You get to pet the cat.

294
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,400
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

295
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,160
Anyway, sorry, but I just I since I did play it a little bit and I think this game.

296
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,960
Here's the thing. Sorry, I don't mean to harp too much on this, but I think it's important.

297
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,600
Another game with a lot of fanfare came out this week, and that's Square Enix's

298
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,720
Fourspoken, right?

299
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,840
They've been really putting a lot of money into promoting that.

300
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And they had the demo that came out.

301
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,360
And it's been landing to mixed reviews.

302
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,520
Now, I I don't have a horse in this race.

303
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,640
I don't have a PS5.

304
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,000
I can't even play it if I wanted to.

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,320
I haven't played it myself.

306
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,200
I don't know if it you know, I saw that clip float around the Internet

307
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,120
of the scene of the voice acting that people were criticizing.

308
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,800
And I did not think it was as bad as people were making it out to be.

309
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,240
And I think I think there's a tell in there, but I digress.

310
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,800
If the game is bad, the game is bad.

311
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,480
That's, you know, the what it is at the end of the day.

312
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,960
But I just that is a, they've been hyping it for months and months and

313
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,360
months, $70, you know, preorder it, get it out there game.

314
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,080
And then this shows up pretty much the same day, $30 or game pass or, you

315
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,200
know, whatever.

316
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,520
And you can grab it and now and now everybody's streaming this one.

317
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,160
Whereas the other one, Square Enix is paying people to stream it.

318
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't think that's happening here.

319
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,040
So it's it's a very interesting yin and yang happening this week.

320
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,880
And again, I'm not trying to dog on the other game.

321
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm just saying hey, from my perspective sitting here, this is

322
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,960
really interesting how this one is really dominating the conversation

323
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,760
because it was a shadow release that you know, even if you don't have

324
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,440
game pass is half as much on Steam, basically.

325
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,560
So anyway.

326
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,200
See other things that you talked about Elder Scrolls Online is

327
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,360
getting yet another piece of DLC.

328
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,560
So they are going to be introducing Necrom, which is taking place, I

329
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,240
guess, on an Eastern Morrowind and also introducing a new class of the

330
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,560
Arcanist and yeah, it looks pretty cool.

331
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,040
Still, I don't know.

332
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,960
I'm probably should give Elder Scrolls Online a try again.

333
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,480
I've tried giving this game a try and I got, I'm not into it.

334
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,720
Like I've tried, but maybe I, you know what?

335
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,040
I just I'm not into the Elder Scrolls universe at all.

336
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,520
Yeah.

337
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,240
I mean, I don't love it as much as Alan or even like Loki probably

338
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,560
does, but I tried to do I bought it when it first came out.

339
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,720
Actually, when it was on the Guild Wars model where you just

340
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,760
bought the game and no, we had a monthly fee at first, right?

341
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,200
I think I bought the game and like paid for a month or something

342
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,800
because I remember playing it before, but I just I couldn't

343
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,200
get into it.

344
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,240
But I know people that play it that really love it.

345
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:58,080
So, yeah, then they showed off some gameplay of Redfall, which

346
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,640
is their new game by Arkane Studios, Austin, and kind of

347
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,280
a vampire FPS type thing.

348
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,160
So they did a little bit of a deep dive there.

349
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,160
It's supposed to be coming out May 2nd and I think that was it.

350
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,440
Yeah, I don't know if this last game, the Redfall is super

351
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
up my alley, but it looks nice.

352
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,840
Like, you know, the artwork is very good and the graphics

353
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,560
and all that stuff.

354
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,160
It's, you know, it's very good looking.

355
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Arkane makes good games with Dishonored and stuff.

356
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,200
So, I mean, yeah, it'd be worth checking out.

357
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I don't know.

358
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,200
Yeah, we'll see.

359
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
Some other comments coming into chat.

360
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,280
QuestBuster saying I'd give ESO a try, but there's so much

361
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,600
to get caught up on on this point.

362
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,080
You know, there's a lot of MMOs that kind of have that problem, right?

363
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah.

364
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
I will say, having flirted with Warcraft again, even though

365
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,560
my sub is gone now, but for the month or two I was playing

366
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,440
it, I will say the catch up model they put in that game kind

367
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,320
of works really well.

368
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,400
Is that basically it's like for you to level from level one.

369
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,560
No, they have a starting area that takes you from one to

370
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,640
ten, and then you can pick any prior expansion or even float

371
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,320
between them if you want to get from ten to, I think, 60,

372
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
which was the old cap.

373
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,920
And then you go to Dragonflight to do the new cap 60 to 70.

374
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,840
I thought that was a smart way to do it because you can

375
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
kind of taste whatever expansion you want to do, you know,

376
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
and then do it that way.

377
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
So and then let's see.

378
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,280
Pelehatome on chat says I put like 100 hours into ESO and

379
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,800
then suddenly burned out.

380
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,960
QuestBuster says I remember being in the beta and it was

381
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,680
in rough shape, but it's really improved from what I understand.

382
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,800
So, yeah, some comments from chat.

383
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,920
Now, here's my question.

384
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,600
What did you think of the event as a whole?

385
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,480
Because we don't usually see a lot of directs like this where

386
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
it's they did a few games, and they did a real deep dive on

387
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,960
those games and spent like seven, eight minutes on each

388
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,480
game, as opposed to quick hit two minute trailers for a

389
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
bunch of things.

390
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
This was more of like a deep dive type of thing.

391
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,120
And, you know, Bobby had a comment that is, you know, in

392
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,000
line with where a lot of gamers are at in chat at twitch.tv

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,680
slash vog network saying, we wish we got more deeper dives

394
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,720
instead of just a pre rendered trailer does a deeper dive.

395
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
Man, that was boring.

396
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,120
Why couldn't that just been a trailer?

397
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
So is this just another case of gamers?

398
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,600
Gamers hate everything.com or what is it?

399
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,920
I guess it depends what their expectations are.

400
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,720
Like, I think when people hear Xbox Bethesda showcase, they

401
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,240
think of like E3 showcase type thing when this is more in

402
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,400
line of like, say, a state of play type thing that EA would

403
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,480
or not EA of Sony would do or something like that.

404
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,560
To be fair, they called it developer direct, which I don't

405
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
think I've ever heard him use before.

406
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
But I also completely understand.

407
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,480
And we've talked about this before, too.

408
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,560
Perception is everything.

409
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
You can call it deep dive on four game showcase.

410
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,960
People are still going to perceive it as something something

411
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,840
in this industry that happens all the time, right?

412
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,080
Yeah.

413
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,320
Yeah.

414
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,840
I mean, it's just like the where Nintendo come out with

415
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
like their indie showcases.

416
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,480
Like, listen, we are not showing Zelda.

417
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,920
We're not showing Zelda.

418
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,120
Don't expect Zelda.

419
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,080
Zelda will not be here.

420
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,120
We're not showing Zelda.

421
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
And then, like, you know, people say, why didn't they show

422
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,800
Zelda? Well, this might be the first E3 or that time period,

423
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,000
summer time period where we don't get gamers that fucking

424
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,280
say that because a Zelda game will have just come out in May.

425
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,400
You know, someone's still going to say it, but you would be

426
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,680
showing off a new Zelda.

427
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,160
You would think any gamer that fucking knows anything about

428
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,240
anything is going to be like, okay, they're not going to

429
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,680
announce a Zelda this summer right after they just released,

430
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,440
you know, Tears of the Kingdom.

431
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
Where's my Zelda maker?

432
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
Why aren't they showing Zelda maker?

433
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,840
No, now it'll be where's Metroid Prime 4?

434
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
That's going to be the new.

435
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,080
Where's Metroid Prime?

436
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,120
Did you know Metroid Prime 4 was rebooted four years ago?

437
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,400
Where is Metroid Prime 4?

438
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,080
I'm hoping that they do a remaster of 0gx, but, you know,

439
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,320
because that's been rumored for a while now, too.

440
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,920
Don't play with my heartstrings.

441
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,720
Who's right now?

442
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,160
Who's really that?

443
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,040
Who's TikTok is rumoring that you can say anything you want

444
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,680
on that platform.

445
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,800
No one's going to fact check you.

446
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,920
Literally, I swear to God.

447
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,400
All right, so I guess that's really it for the developer

448
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,040
recap, but is there anything that you kind of wish they'd

449
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,480
showed that they didn't show?

450
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
Like, obviously for me, you know, but I'm not saying this

451
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
is a negative against Microsoft.

452
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,920
I think they did a fine job.

453
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,240
I think if you listen to what they said, they set the

454
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,800
expectation where they set the expectation.

455
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,600
I think on top of that, they shadow released a hell of a

456
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,800
game that's now dominating the conversation this week.

457
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,200
Like I said, even above some games that have been hyped for

458
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
months and months.

459
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,640
And I think this HiFi Rush's release is going to change the

460
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,000
conversation on how some games are marketed.

461
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,640
It really is.

462
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,560
Not every game can get away with this, but this one can.

463
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,720
By the way, can I just say how wild is it on HiFi Rush?

464
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
This is specifically the studio that did, like, the Evil

465
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,160
Within did this.

466
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,840
Like, I'm sure there's people out there going, where's Evil

467
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
Within 3?

468
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,680
And I get it.

469
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,080
You want sequels to the games you love.

470
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,720
But then when you see stuff like this come out of it, it's

471
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,440
like, okay, but isn't it cool when a studio can, like, do

472
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
whatever they want to do?

473
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
Because you would have had this if they just went right into

474
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,840
making Evil Within 3, right?

475
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,680
I guess, yeah.

476
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,200
What I would like, I mean, like, just with Mojang, can you

477
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
please show me what you're doing with Minecraft, please?

478
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,800
Anything?

479
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,160
Like, we've been seeing trailers for Minecraft Legends.

480
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,400
It's like, okay, I don't want to see that.

481
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
Can you show me what you're doing with mainline Minecraft?

482
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,560
Because, like, what we get out of them lately, like, their

483
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,080
new thing that they showed off in a snapshot is armor trims.

484
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,760
It's literally, like, a stripe of color on armor.

485
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,760
That they've been working on this for two years, you guys.

486
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,360
The idea of putting a stripe on some armor, that's two years

487
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,080
in the making.

488
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,040
And it's like, okay, can you just show me what you're working

489
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,440
on? Like, what is the general, like,

490
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,560
It's Minecraft Legends.

491
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,600
Everybody's working on that.

492
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
Was it general?

493
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,920
Oh, exactly.

494
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,320
It was a general theme of, like,

495
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,200
Wouldn't it just be a simple texture and color assignment?

496
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,320
It is, but they have, it's sort of, not exactly.

497
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,600
So it is, they have to re-basically build the way the

498
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,560
armor is structured, like, tag-wise and everything.

499
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,800
They have to redesign, like, the different workstations to

500
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
allow for this new type of thing.

501
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
They're just retooling some of that stuff.

502
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,520
But it seems like it's such a minor thing.

503
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
It's like, excuse.

504
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,000
They spent a lot of time this week telling us about, like,

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,200
how excited, and people are, some people are excited about

506
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,120
it because, like, oh, cool, I can customize stuff.

507
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,200
But, like, it doesn't make a huge difference.

508
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,320
Like, it really doesn't.

509
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,800
It's just rebalancing stuff.

510
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,520
But if that doesn't tell me what the next update's about,

511
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,600
it just tells me that this is a thing that they're working

512
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,760
on that's totally independent from everything else.

513
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,400
But we still don't know what that is because, like,

514
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,320
we have, like, okay, there's these armor trims and we've

515
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,960
got bookshelves and we've got camels and we've got signs

516
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,760
that are hanging and we've got this prehistoric six-legged

517
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,720
turtle thing that sniffs up seeds.

518
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,280
What the heck does that have to do with anything?

519
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,800
It's just such a random assortment of things.

520
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,160
It's just like, here's all the stuff that we're working on

521
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,000
that we really don't have a place to fit it.

522
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,920
We're just going to put that all into an update.

523
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,480
But things that are, like, people have been asking for,

524
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,120
like stairs and slabs for concrete, for example, that is

525
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,840
literally something that they have the model built in.

526
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,320
They have the structures to be able to put this in the game.

527
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,920
All they literally would have to do is create the item.

528
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,320
The textures are already in the game.

529
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,000
The models are in the game.

530
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,840
It's just, it's literally setting up data.

531
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,800
It would take one person maybe an afternoon to do that,

532
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
but they don't do that because of course not.

533
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,400
It's just weird stuff.

534
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,280
I would have liked to have seen Fable, to be honest.

535
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,680
Yes.

536
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,120
That's the one I would have liked to see.

537
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,560
But I also understand, you know, like, again, I'm not shitting

538
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,520
on what they did show.

539
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,000
I thought it was fine, but yeah.

540
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,080
So, all right.

541
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,080
This sometimes happens.

542
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,560
While we're trying to do a show, but apparently we have

543
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,760
breaking news that's coming in.

544
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,640
We have breaking news right now that's coming in from the

545
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,680
chat. Of course, it's unsourced breaking news.

546
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,160
I'd like to know where this is coming from, but I'm trusting

547
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
the person who says it.

548
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,680
But apparently, oops, not the intro.

549
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,200
Apparently, Alan is saying that TwitchCon 2023 is in Vegas.

550
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,080
That that has just happened.

551
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,520
I did not see anything on the official TwitchCon Twitter or

552
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,880
Twitch Twitter.

553
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,920
So source, please look at their webpage.

554
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,560
I didn't.

555
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,920
So maybe that's where it's coming from.

556
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,640
But I'm just asking.

557
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,800
I'm asking Alan where the source is.

558
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
So we'll try to find that.

559
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,280
But let's say it's true.

560
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,440
How do you feel about that?

561
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
How would you feel about a TwitchCon?

562
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,920
It's not on their website yet.

563
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,640
Yeah.

564
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,560
Alan, did you get duped and share it with us?

565
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
I think he did.

566
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,720
He's not talking now.

567
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,720
Um, no, I saw this floating around like a month ago.

568
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,080
I mean, Vegas is a big convention town.

569
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,480
So it wouldn't be it wouldn't exactly be surprising.

570
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,760
I will say this Final Fantasy Fan Fest was in Vegas.

571
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,800
They were going to move to San Diego, but that was for the

572
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,080
2020 Fan Fest.

573
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,160
And we all know what happened to 2020.

574
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,240
So now they're going back to Vegas.

575
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,880
So I mean, it you do have conventions that ping pong a

576
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,480
little bit between like San Diego and Vegas and TwitchCon

577
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
has not always been in San Diego.

578
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
TwitchCon has moved around.

579
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,720
They've gone Long Beach.

580
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,320
They've been San Francisco.

581
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,040
So it's plausible that they could be going to Vegas.

582
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,800
I'm not going to believe anything until it's posted on

583
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,760
their website.

584
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,260
All right.

585
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,280
So Bobby is saying allegedly, the Pasqui Hotel reservation

586
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,920
got leaked.

587
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
And that is what is leading to this wildfire.

588
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,680
And there it is.

589
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,760
Alan is linking us the Pasqui.

590
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay, so this is coming from pasqui.com.

591
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,000
And it does say TwitchCon Las Vegas, October 20th, 2023 to

592
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,120
October 22nd, 2023.

593
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,960
Okay, I'm willing to give this a lot more credit now because

594
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,320
I would not see something like this on pasqui.com.

595
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,400
And this is not some viral site.

596
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,200
This is, you know, a handmade site, but I would not see

597
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,560
something like that on pasqui.com if there wasn't something

598
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,060
to that.

599
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
So interesting.

600
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,640
But yes, Dark Soccer is probably right.

601
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,560
You should wait for the official announcement because dates

602
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,280
could still shift around until this is released to the public.

603
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,280
A lot of this can still change.

604
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,000
But thank you.

605
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,800
This is definitely now a where there's smoke, there's fire

606
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,680
type of situation.

607
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,360
So interesting.

608
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,880
I think Vegas is a great place for TwitchCon.

609
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
You're not going to have the problem about hotels or trying

610
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,560
to get around or anything like that.

611
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Vegas is built to have conventions.

612
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,800
I would be curious where they're having it.

613
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,120
Are they having it at the actual convention center, which

614
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,520
is pretty big?

615
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
Or are they going to have it at one of the hotel convention

616
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,440
centers, which every hotel there is built to have a mid size

617
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,320
to huge convention.

618
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,840
I've been to conventions at not Treasure Island.

619
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,320
What's the other one?

620
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,820
Mirage.

621
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,000
And that was actually I think they're bulldozing the Mirage

622
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
though. So maybe that's not where it's going to be.

623
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,000
Who else had Paris?

624
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,760
The Paris had Fan Fest one year.

625
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,720
It was pretty good.

626
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
The Rio had Fan Fest a couple years.

627
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,120
I didn't like that one because it was off the strip.

628
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,640
That one's a little harder to get to because it's not on

629
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,920
the same line as the rest.

630
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,480
So interesting.

631
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,880
Wow.

632
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,480
Alan is saying, according to the same site, Pasqui could

633
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,440
show up on Tuesday for that.

634
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,240
That's wild.

635
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,960
Yeah, I'm with Bobby.

636
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm going to black out the days anyway, just so I don't

637
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,360
schedule something else.

638
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,760
I get to do that when you go back to work.

639
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,600
That is Halloween.

640
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,760
And that is the season when I do a lot of hosting stuff.

641
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,280
So we'll see what happens.

642
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,760
Interesting.

643
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,160
Interesting.

644
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,480
All right.

645
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,840
Anyway, there's your breaking news.

646
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,480
Thank you, Alan.

647
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,520
And thank you for sourcing that.

648
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,160
I appreciate it.

649
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,160
Okay, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks, the

650
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,560
types of video games that we have been playing this week.

651
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,680
So Dark Soccer, I'll go to you.

652
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,560
How is your gaming week?

653
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,880
I played Star Ocean.

654
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
I've played Dead by Daylight.

655
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,240
I finally made Eerie 1, a survivor.

656
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,840
Um, that means I can fuck around and find out.

657
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,160
No, I just got to fuck around.

658
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,520
I don't care about finding out anything.

659
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,800
I've played my stupid word game.

660
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,360
I've been playing a lot of Midnight Suns on my own now that

661
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm not limited to streaming it.

662
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,640
So that's all.

663
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,480
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

664
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
It's all Minecraft still.

665
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,760
I finished building trees on the SMP now and basically

666
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,280
getting footage together to edit another episode together.

667
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,760
Although I should have done my modded series more.

668
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,480
I suppose I've made an episode in that sooner, but whatever.

669
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Nothing matters because no one sees it.

670
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,320
It's fine.

671
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,120
All right, my gaming week.

672
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,600
I pretty much already talked about one of the big new games

673
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,280
I played this week, which is HiFi Rush.

674
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,600
I talked about that in the earlier segment where that was

675
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,240
relevant. Again, if the concept of a beatonetta game, Bayonetta

676
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,560
meets a beatmatching game, if that sounds attractive to you,

677
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,080
then you definitely should check out this game, especially

678
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,960
if you have Game Pass.

679
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160
You know, it's one of those things where it's like, you're

680
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,800
paying for Game Pass.

681
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,080
Anyway, go check it out.

682
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,120
As far as other games I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy

683
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,640
XIV, still on that.

684
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,200
I tried to get a medium house in the lottery, but I didn't

685
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,240
win the medium house.

686
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,880
Boo.

687
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,200
Oh, well, I've also been playing Dead by Daylight, actually.

688
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
I prestiged finally Quentin and I got his Adept.

689
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,720
So, yeah, I did all that in one go.

690
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,400
Thank you.

691
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,080
Because his perks are very kind of situational.

692
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,040
Although I like his pharmacy perk.

693
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,840
I like that's very kind of stealthy because that's how you

694
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,320
can go into the match without an item and still get the

695
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,920
item. Hattie has a really good perk for flashlight bullies

696
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,080
on the same line, but I'm more of a healer than a flash.

697
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,400
I can't.

698
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
I can't flash my save to save my life.

699
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,960
So Hattie's perk is a pain in the ass.

700
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,200
Yeah.

701
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,160
So let's see, outside of Dead by Daylight, I did play one

702
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,440
other new game this week.

703
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,760
Let's talk about Niantic's new game that also released this

704
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,160
week.

705
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,120
So Niantic is the studio, of course, that brought us Pokemon

706
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,840
Go.

707
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,720
I've talked about other games that they've made, like Ingress,

708
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,880
Pikmin Bloom is one I quite enjoy.

709
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,680
And this week that same studio brought us NBA All World is

710
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,880
the game that they came out with.

711
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,880
And they've pretty much openly said in interviews, they're

712
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,680
trying to go for an audience that doesn't really go for

713
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,880
their games otherwise.

714
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,360
That sports game fans and sports game enthusiasts and Pokemon

715
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,960
have like a 10% overlap.

716
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,040
I think they threw that statistic out in one of their

717
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,680
interviews.

718
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,000
So they're trying to reach a new audience with this NBA All

719
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,640
World game.

720
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,360
Basically, in the game, you can go around in the places that

721
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,680
would normally be Pokestops would drop like items such as

722
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,400
XP up or new shoes or a different type of basketball.

723
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,720
And you also encounter players in the wild like they're

724
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,280
Pokemon.

725
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,560
That's the funniest part is that NBA players are now Pokemon.

726
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,120
So you encounter them in the wild and you basically it's

727
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
literally 1v1 me, bro.

728
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,920
That's what you do.

729
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,640
But it's a little more intricate of a game than in Pokemon

730
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,040
Go, how you just throw the ball and try to catch it.

731
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,600
In this one, you might do a shot drill like who can get the

732
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,120
most shots and so forth.

733
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,440
You might do it around the world type of thing.

734
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,560
Or you might actually do like a 1v1 type of minigame.

735
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,680
And this is also what you do when you want to take control

736
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,360
of the court, which is akin to Pokemon Go's gyms.

737
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,160
Now, because the Niantic Wayfarer and Waypoint and the

738
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,840
database of all their points of interest is pretty robust

739
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,720
at this point.

740
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,480
They've actually made it so that actual basketball courts,

741
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,960
whether they're at your public park or wherever they are,

742
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,160
actual basketball courts are basketball courts in the game.

743
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,800
And you basically fight to take control of them.

744
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,400
However, the basketball courts are occupied by bots at the

745
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,520
beginning of the week, and you want to be there longer than

746
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,560
anybody else.

747
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,040
So if you want to be at the top of the board, you have to

748
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,120
dethrone 10 bots to do it.

749
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,440
Here's the thing.

750
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,920
There's a lot about NBA World conceptually that I like.

751
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,400
I think they did take the Pokemon Go formula and tried to

752
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,840
make it a little more attractive to an audience that isn't

753
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,800
interested in Pokemon Go otherwise, like sports game fans,

754
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,840
like I get what they're going for.

755
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,640
But for this game, unlike Pokemon Go, unlike Pikmin, I feel

756
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,400
like the places of interest and the AR gaming element is

757
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,480
secondary to the basketball game that you play in it, which

758
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,720
to some people would be a very attractive point.

759
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
I get that.

760
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,240
But that also means that the basketball game in it has to

761
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,740
be good.

762
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,800
And the little mini basketball game that you play in it to

763
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,600
take control of a court, it gets repetitive real fast.

764
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
Do you throw the basket or the ball in the basket like the

765
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,760
Pokeballs?

766
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,280
No, it's not anything like that.

767
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,320
Basically, it's you versus another player.

768
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,600
It's a bot, really.

769
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,040
And you can move left or right and you can tap to juke or

770
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,360
you can hold to move, basically.

771
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,680
And then you kind of do that or you can move forward.

772
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,840
And if you get close to the basket, your character will try

773
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,040
to slam dunk it.

774
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,440
Or you can do like a shot thing from the three point range

775
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,080
where a little meter goes up and down and you try to release

776
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,360
it right at the point.

777
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,760
And if the other player didn't block, then you might score.

778
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,280
It's a very rudimentary, like old school 90s type of

779
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,720
basketball game, I guess, which is fine.

780
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,640
But I'm just going to be completely honest.

781
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
It sucks to play on a cell phone because we're back in the

782
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,880
classic problem, the classic problem that Niantic ought to

783
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,280
know better when it comes to developing cell phone games,

784
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,600
because they've been one of the only successful developers

785
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,960
to buck the trend.

786
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,080
And that is when you make a cell phone game, you want to

787
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,360
make you experience that's uniquely cell phone.

788
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,600
You don't want to shoehorn a console experience into a

789
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,720
mobile game.

790
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,600
That's the biggest problem with NBA All World.

791
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,720
It is a mediocre at best, really repetitive basketball

792
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,160
game that honestly ends up not being fun to play after a

793
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,960
certain amount of time because you're trying to move left

794
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,080
or no, I'm trying to juke.

795
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,200
Oops, I moved.

796
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,720
Oh, it thought my tap was a hold.

797
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,360
It controls like ass.

798
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,800
So I like a lot of cell phone games that aren't

799
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,120
intentionally meant to be cell phone games kind of do.

800
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,760
Like, I don't know why this game doesn't control better.

801
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,880
It's not fun to play.

802
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,680
I'm trying to have faith because a lot of the Niantic

803
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,440
games have gotten better with time.

804
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,280
I think Pikmin Bloom a year on is in a way better place

805
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,880
than it even was when it launched.

806
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,080
Pokemon Go has grown a lot in the years it's been out.

807
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
Some would say for the worse.

808
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,720
But when you consider year zero to, like, let's say right

809
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,960
before the pandemic, if you compare 2016 Pokemon Go to 2020

810
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,360
early 2020 Pokemon Go, I think you'd go, yeah, this game is

811
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,120
a lot better than it was when it first came out.

812
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,040
Some of the changes they've made since then, I understand

813
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
where people are upset.

814
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,320
I think NBA All World, if it doesn't really start to mix

815
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,920
up that experience and maybe have there be more of a point

816
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,440
to the AR end of things, I think it's going to fizzle out

817
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,920
real quick.

818
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,120
Sorry to say, because I want to support the Niantic stuff.

819
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,920
I love AR games, but I'm not going to make believe that I

820
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,640
enjoy this game more than I actually do, which is I don't

821
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,920
really feel like playing that fucking 1v1 game 10 times

822
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,400
while standing at the basketball court in the park just

823
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,960
to get some extra items that are probably going to fall out

824
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,680
of my inventory anyway, because the inventory system in the

825
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,040
game is laughably limited.

826
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,400
Laughably.

827
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,840
Like, what?

828
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,800
It's a cheap money grab to try to get you to expand your

829
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,320
bag space right off the bat.

830
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,560
When the initial release of the game, and I think it might

831
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,680
have fixed it since then, doesn't even warn you that you're

832
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,880
about to hit the cap.

833
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,760
Oh, by the way, if you try to claim items from an achievement,

834
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,840
those items go straight in the garbage.

835
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,240
You don't even have a chance to say, oh, let me get rid of

836
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,800
something else so I can claim these more rare items from an

837
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,440
achievement.

838
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,040
That really ticked me off.

839
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,040
So that part of it, like, yikes.

840
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
So do I recommend the NBA All World?

841
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,640
Not right now.

842
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,920
But maybe in a few months, unless you, like, love basketball.

843
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,560
And look, I promise you what I'm saying about this game does

844
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,080
not come from a place of, oh, Rob doesn't play sports games.

845
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,880
I guarantee those of you that are into sports games are going

846
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
to have the same impressions I had of this.

847
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,040
And I don't hate sports games just because they're sports

848
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,360
games.

849
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,960
In fact, I actually rather like a lot of the arcadey type

850
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,000
of sports games.

851
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,080
If the 1v1 mode was like NBA Jam, but actually controlled

852
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,400
well on a phone, I'd fucking be into that.

853
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,120
I sure would.

854
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,880
But it's not.

855
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,320
It's boring.

856
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,280
So there you go.

857
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,720
That's my review of NBA All World.

858
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,160
ZenMonkey11 says it controls like ass.

859
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,200
Should be in a game review.

860
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,960
If they want to put that on the store, that's fine.

861
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,720
Bobby Black Wolf says, yeah, it's interesting to see that

862
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,600
some kids can only use touch screen technology, either

863
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,400
tablets or phones, put them in front of a keyboard and mouse,

864
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,440
and they freeze up.

865
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,880
I would be shocked if even a child could do what they wanted

866
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,920
to do in this game.

867
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
Again, I'm telling you, I'm tapping to juke.

868
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,280
Oops, I moved.

869
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,960
Like, who thought that was a good idea?

870
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,680
Anyway, SG100Matt says I'm waiting for NHL World where

871
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
the gameplay is NHL 94.

872
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,280
Well, if the game does well, I'm sure they'll try to partner

873
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,560
with other sports things.

874
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,840
I would be curious what you get at NBA All World if you go

875
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,880
to the actual Golden One Center, which is, you know, I walk

876
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,760
downtown all the time.

877
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,120
I walk by Golden One Center and I know the actual NBA arenas

878
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,080
are like they're programmed to something different in the

879
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,840
game. So I don't know.

880
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,600
Will we get to see the beam, which is the big new thing in

881
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,880
Sacramento when the Kings win?

882
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,480
Light the beam, light the beam.

883
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,600
This is big purple beam.

884
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,280
They shoot up in the sky whenever the Kings win.

885
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,800
We don't get to see it that often, huh?

886
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,000
Actually, the Kings are having a better year than usual.

887
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,960
Like, they're like number three in the league right now.

888
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:42,080
It's the beam brought them alien space powers that they

889
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,200
didn't otherwise have.

890
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,400
Okay, there it is.

891
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,880
All right.

892
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,800
Anyway, of all the sports balls, basketball is probably

893
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,040
basketball and hockey are definitely my two favorites out

894
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,840
of all the sports balls.

895
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm going to go with baseball and rugby.

896
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
All right, let's move on.

897
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,280
We'll get into some news.

898
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,160
Let's get into what else happened in the gaming world this

899
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,040
week. We'll go to Loki.

900
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,820
Yep.

901
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,400
So we had a story about League of Legends source code being

902
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,280
hacked. So apparently it is being held ransom right now.

903
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,640
They said that over the weekend, our analysis confirmed

904
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,760
source code for League TFT and Legacy anti-cheat platform

905
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,600
were exfiltrated by the attackers.

906
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,480
Today we received the ransom email.

907
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
Needless to say, we won't pay.

908
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,580
Okay.

909
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,760
And they haven't said that right now.

910
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,720
No player data or personal information have been taken.

911
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,560
But they said that the attack would slow down the release

912
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
of upcoming patches of its game.

913
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,400
Yeah, because somebody could use that source code pretty

914
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,280
dangerously to make cheats and things for the game.

915
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,080
League of Legends is very well known as a competitive type

916
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,580
of game.

917
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,680
Exploiting the source code for more accurate and under

918
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,960
the radar type of cheats.

919
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,840
That can be a very dangerous and deadly thing for League

920
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,400
of Legends.

921
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,200
Right.

922
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,360
Since the attack, we've been working to assess its impact

923
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,960
on anti-cheat and it'll be prepared to deploy fixes as quickly

924
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,240
as possible if needed.

925
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:23,680
Yeah.

926
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,800
I mean, considering they have the source for the anti-cheat

927
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,300
as well.

928
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,400
Well, I guess they're Legacy anti-cheat.

929
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,400
Well, good job, hackers.

930
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,000
Now they're going to have to put Denuvo in it.

931
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,720
So good job.

932
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,760
I'm just kidding.

933
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,080
Please.

934
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,480
Not bad.

935
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,040
Yeah, but that's well, I mean, kudos to them.

936
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,560
Putting their foot down and basically saying no, like we're

937
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,600
not, like we're not giving into ransom period and like making

938
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,640
that very explicit.

939
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,400
I mean, that's, it's a dangerous thing to do because I'm

940
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,080
sure that they'll just put it out.

941
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,240
Like, you know, they've got nothing to lose in that situation.

942
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,960
Yeah, or someone will leak the source code.

943
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,360
Then if they figure they can't get any money from it, they'll

944
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,400
just put it public.

945
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm sure everybody will have access to their anti-cheat stuff.

946
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,260
Yeah.

947
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,840
So yeah, I was gonna say the worst that can happen, the

948
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,120
anti-cheat stuff happens.

949
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,000
You could also, I mean, if the source code were to get out

950
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,480
there, then hypothetically, people could kind of make their

951
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,160
own League of Legends leagues.

952
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,280
It would be frozen in time, so to speak, you know, it would

953
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,400
never get updated again, but you could use the current state

954
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,960
of the source code to basically make like a League of Legends

955
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,520
that would run on a different server set, right?

956
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,640
If, if that, for all I know, you know, hackers going to hack

957
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
that already exists for all I know, right?

958
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,560
Private servers for MMOs, right?

959
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,440
We know things like, you know, back in the day, Phantasy

960
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,600
Star Online, Blue Burst, and all that had fucking private

961
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,240
servers.

962
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,280
Wow, had private servers.

963
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,640
Eleven still has private servers.

964
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,160
I'm sure 14 has private servers.

965
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,360
I just don't know about them.

966
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,120
You know, most MMOs have private servers.

967
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,600
I'm sure League of Legends is actually probably no different.

968
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,760
I'm just not embedded in the community enough to know about

969
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,960
them, but this is going to make that a lot stronger too in

970
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,240
that whole scene.

971
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,360
But I mean, if League of Legends is a really competitive

972
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,000
game, this might also be one of those, if a tree falls in

973
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
the middle of the woods, does anyone actually hear it?

974
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
Because if you're the king of the hill on a private server,

975
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,280
who cares?

976
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,560
It's not the real deal, right?

977
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,080
It matters to those people on the private server, but not

978
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,880
to the League community as a whole, likely.

979
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,400
Again, I'm not super embedded in the League community, so

980
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,680
I can't profess to know, but I would imagine that it doesn't

981
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,840
really matter if you're king of the hill on a private server.

982
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,440
Anyway, all right.

983
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,160
Maybe a game that you will be more competitive on that will

984
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,000
get people to notice would be Advance Wars, the remake, if

985
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,760
this ever actually comes out.

986
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,400
But it does seem like a recent listing for Walmart, and it

987
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,040
doesn't end there.

988
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,080
Best Buy, Amazon Canada, EB Games.

989
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,720
They are now relisting Advance Wars 1 plus 2 reboot.

990
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,040
You may remember this collection was originally announced

991
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,080
for the Nintendo Switch, and then it was bumped back.

992
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,880
It was originally announced in December 2021, but it was

993
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,480
pushed back indefinitely because of Russia's military invasion

994
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,560
of Ukraine, and some of the storyline in Advance Wars hits

995
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,440
a little close to home with that whole topic.

996
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,080
So for the game to have come out when it was originally

997
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,960
scheduled, Nintendo felt, reading the room, that it would

998
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,000
have been in poor taste.

999
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,000
Even though that conflict is still going on a year from now,

1000
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,360
perhaps Nintendo is reading the room that people are just

1001
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,520
immune to it now, or they're not going to feel it's in poor

1002
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,960
taste or whatever it is.

1003
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,040
They're possibly going to be releasing the game sooner if

1004
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,520
these retail listings are to be believed.

1005
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,680
It's showing up at the retail sites, but we don't know when.

1006
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,120
I'm not seeing a win on these sites, just that the entry is

1007
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,320
showing back up on these sites, which would indicate that a

1008
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,880
release is coming in the somewhat near future.

1009
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
It could be something that's all the way at the holiday, for

1010
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,460
all we know.

1011
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,120
It could be a stealth release during the next Nintendo Direct.

1012
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,600
It could be a lot of things, so you just have to wait and

1013
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,320
see, I suppose.

1014
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,080
DarkTitsia in chat says, I'd imagine Nintendo's first direct

1015
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,520
of 2023 might give us the date for Advance Wars 1 and 2,

1016
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,920
especially if we're seeing these listings all pop up.

1017
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,800
Yes, probably that or E3, I imagine.

1018
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,560
And when I say E3, E3 means not just actual E3 because we

1019
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,480
really don't know what that's going to look like this year.

1020
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,080
I use E3 on this show now to mean the summer announcement

1021
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,040
period, and not E3 included.

1022
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,880
Summer Game Fest, all of it, June.

1023
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,040
sj100matt says, I've been excited for this Advance Wars

1024
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,160
reboot, but yeah, totally get why they delayed it.

1025
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,160
sj100matt, do you think it matters now?

1026
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,560
Do you think people are going to say, oh, and I open this up

1027
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,800
to anyone, not just Matt, that oh, now, even though there's

1028
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,640
still a war going on that Russia did start with Ukraine,

1029
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,680
it's not finished.

1030
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,640
In fact, it's only getting more complicated, actually.

1031
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,400
But just due to the length of time, we just don't care now?

1032
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,600
I'd be curious.

1033
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,040
sj100matt does say, I do wonder how much additional polish

1034
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,200
they've done with it being delayed a year.

1035
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,840
Part of me hopes they balance things because the game was

1036
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,360
pretty unbalanced to some points.

1037
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,280
You know, that's another pretty good point, though, is that

1038
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,960
this delay has allowed them to go back and, you know, polish

1039
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,680
things up a little bit, get the dirt off the car, so to speak,

1040
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,440
with the game and release it in a tip top shape.

1041
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,560
It'd be interesting.

1042
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:36,960
We'll see.

1043
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,480
Matt goes on to continue, I think the blow has been softened.

1044
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,960
Does it make it any less right in the scope of things,

1045
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,240
releasing it out?

1046
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,760
Yeah, or releasing it now?

1047
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,680
Yeah, I mean, for me, like, it's not like Nintendo started

1048
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,200
the situation that's going on.

1049
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,760
You know, sometimes art imitates life in unintended ways.

1050
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,680
And I don't think anybody's going to go, God, Nintendo,

1051
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
what a tacky ass thing to do, right?

1052
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,160
Well, actually, the way social media is these days, maybe.

1053
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,680
They put out Call of Duty Modern Warfare, so Modern Warfare 2,

1054
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,920
so I don't really think that, you know...

1055
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,640
If anyone critically thinks about it for a few moments,

1056
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,040
they'll realize this is a remake of a game that was out

1057
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,360
a long time ago before any of this.

1058
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,080
So, and as Joe and Hunter Matt points out, other war games

1059
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,080
have come out since the conflict has started.

1060
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,640
So, all right, moving on.

1061
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,320
Let's go to a different type of game.

1062
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:34,960
Dark Sakura.

1063
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,440
For people who are into leaked footage, over 10 minutes of

1064
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,720
some early Horizon multiplayer gameplay has been leaked

1065
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,360
on Reddit.

1066
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,520
Funny enough, they said that the post was deleted,

1067
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,120
but on the link that I clicked, I could still see it,

1068
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,720
even though it said deleted post.

1069
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,960
But they said that the footage is from an old alpha build

1070
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,000
from summer 2020 that was the Horizon Forbidden West alpha

1071
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,880
that was, you know, going around.

1072
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,320
And another person who actually had knowledge of the project

1073
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,440
believed that the footage and art was authentic.

1074
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,600
Guerrilla did confirm in December they're planning to,

1075
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,880
and I quote, expand the world of Horizon with an online co-op

1076
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,640
with a cast of new characters, and that they were planning

1077
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,120
for a trilogy of Horizon games.

1078
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:41,680
So it's not unbelievable what this footage might be,

1079
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,360
which by the way, I did save it.

1080
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,760
But I mean, I don't know why the alpha footage would cause

1081
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,160
such a big deal, but it has to be from concepts that are

1082
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,640
going to be coming out or, you know, company secrets.

1083
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,400
I don't know, but it looks good.

1084
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,520
It looks pretty.

1085
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,760
I'm also choosing not to play it now in case there are

1086
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,960
takedown requests going on.

1087
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,800
I don't want to jeopardize the archive, but it's on the

1088
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,000
Internet. It's out there.

1089
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,600
If you know where to look, you'll find it.

1090
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,360
Find it eventually.

1091
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,440
But I liked Horizon.

1092
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,960
I haven't played Forbidden West yet.

1093
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,400
I keep waiting to get a PS5.

1094
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,040
But actually, quick aside, PS5s are showing up in the wild.

1095
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,960
I keep saying I'm not going to get one until I can walk

1096
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,920
into Target and buy one.

1097
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,640
Well, guess what?

1098
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,840
I checked the Target app the other day and PS5s are, like,

1099
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,840
in stock locally, but not at the one I usually shop at.

1100
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,240
So that saved me so far.

1101
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,080
But now I'm also at the point.

1102
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,360
Have you all heard those rumors?

1103
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,760
A refresh in April or so.

1104
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,240
Now I'm kind of like, I don't want to get one until, like,

1105
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
the game I have to play is out.

1106
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,480
Yeah.

1107
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,880
Bobby says, I just heard Rob moving the goalpost.

1108
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,680
Absolutely.

1109
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,560
You did.

1110
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,360
Absolutely.

1111
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:57,840
You did.

1112
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,200
Because if I don't move the goalpost, I'm going to tell you

1113
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,240
what's going to happen.

1114
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,640
I'm going to go buy one of those things at Target tomorrow.

1115
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,600
And then literally the next day, Sony's going to be like,

1116
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,240
we're doing a direct and we're announcing the PS5 slim.

1117
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,960
There's also keep in mind the whole smoke there's fire things.

1118
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,400
Haven't they already identified that there's a disk drive

1119
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,040
available out in the wild that's meant to be sold separately

1120
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,640
with a possible digital refresh?

1121
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,200
Because the disk drive doesn't work with the current digital

1122
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,240
only system.

1123
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,480
So something's being cooked up out there.

1124
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,880
The question is, is it before Final Fantasy 16?

1125
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,160
Or is it a holiday release?

1126
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,100
We'll see.

1127
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,500
Didier Ramirez says, I'll preorder Final Fantasy 7 Remake

1128
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,460
part two, but I'll still wait on the PlayStation 5 Remake.

1129
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,660
Yeah, that's going to be another.

1130
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,660
Like, is Final Fantasy 7 Re...

1131
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,700
I forgot the name of it.

1132
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,740
Not remake, but Re...

1133
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,700
What's the second part called?

1134
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,740
Not recoded.

1135
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,240
Re...

1136
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,420
Revolution.

1137
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,020
What is it called?

1138
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,580
The second part of the remake has a subtitle.

1139
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,740
Is that this holiday as well?

1140
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,980
Is it Rebirth?

1141
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,300
That's it.

1142
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:07,620
Thank you.

1143
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,120
Rebirth.

1144
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,980
Oh, which is I'm trying not to spoil for those that still

1145
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,980
haven't played the Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

1146
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,820
But like, Rebirth is a very appropriate subtitle.

1147
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,220
Just saying.

1148
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,820
Have not played through all of it yet, but it's fine.

1149
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,380
It's fine.

1150
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,020
It's my own fault if I get spoiled for me at this point.

1151
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,620
Because I'm about to blurt it out.

1152
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,340
But I'm not going to.

1153
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,540
I don't care.

1154
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,540
But one of these days, it's just going to fall out my mouth.

1155
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,760
All right.

1156
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,200
Anyway.

1157
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,220
Yeah.

1158
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,700
Oh, Rama says they did say Winter 2023.

1159
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,500
Holy moly.

1160
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,060
That'll be...

1161
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,540
Oh, this is going to be such a big year for games.

1162
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,340
All right.

1163
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,700
Anyway, unfortunately, even though we are looking at a very

1164
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:56,100
big year in games, this story is having a part two this week,

1165
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,620
which is unfortunate, right, Loki?

1166
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:58,660
Yeah.

1167
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,660
So more layoffs in the...

1168
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,860
Well, in this case, it's the games journalism portion

1169
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,460
of the industry.

1170
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:12,980
So the Washington Post was visited by CEO, entrepreneur,

1171
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,020
born in 1964, Jeffrey Bezos.

1172
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,660
And he came in and said, uh-uh, we're not doing no more

1173
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,460
gaming anymore.

1174
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,180
We're down to that.

1175
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,860
We're print media.

1176
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,460
And obviously behind the times with stuff.

1177
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,580
So they laid off a good portion of the staff, including

1178
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:34,420
what they said, 30 vacancies, and that will go unfulfilled

1179
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,980
and 20 staff who no longer have jobs.

1180
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,380
And so they're saying that they're going to be cutting

1181
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,860
different sections out.

1182
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,340
But yeah, the gaming section would be one that is...

1183
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,540
Why doesn't he cut his salary?

1184
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,000
That...

1185
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,780
He needs his billions of dollars.

1186
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,820
No, he doesn't.

1187
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,460
I'm sorry.

1188
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,580
When he comes out and says we're a print journalism.

1189
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,020
Look, I understand.

1190
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,220
I respect.

1191
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,860
Print is a great thing to have in your hands and so forth.

1192
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,020
But it's very not forward thinking.

1193
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,060
Bobby had a comment.

1194
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,140
It was actually on a different story.

1195
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,100
Here it is.

1196
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,380
Bobby said earlier in chat, yeah, it's interesting to see

1197
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,300
that some kids can only use touchscreen technology, either

1198
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,460
tablets or phones, put them in front of a keyboard and mouse

1199
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,420
and they freeze up.

1200
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,740
I've seen some babies toddlers try to swipe and zoom a

1201
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,380
magazine.

1202
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,180
Yeah, I've seen the stories too and talking about like, even

1203
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:38,260
like, people of like, this generation who are now getting

1204
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,780
into the workforce who have never had computers and stuff

1205
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,820
being confused, basically being like kind of how we would

1206
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,060
see, oh, hey, that those those older people at the job.

1207
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,300
They don't know anything about computers and stuff.

1208
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,900
But it's like that now.

1209
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,820
I don't know if that's necessarily the same, though.

1210
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:59,940
Like, I know my kids are working with, like, net, not net

1211
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,740
books, but they have like Chromebooks and stuff in school.

1212
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,540
And I mean, obviously, I'm doing the right thing by raising

1213
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,420
them with computers.

1214
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:10,020
But like, yeah, they don't know how to troubleshoot things

1215
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:14,500
like I used to know, because, you know, growing up on a 286

1216
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,340
or what, I don't know if that was a 286.

1217
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,140
But old computer DOS.

1218
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,340
Sometimes those Chromebooks feel like 286 is just to be

1219
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,180
clear, they run just as fast.

1220
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,260
It's hard to believe that they're actually faster than

1221
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:33,700
that. No, it's, it's like, you know, you don't, you're not

1222
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,300
forced to critically, like, solve those problems and stuff.

1223
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,180
And so yeah, it's like, you're not going to have those skills.

1224
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,580
And honestly, that really does help me in my day to day

1225
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,620
stuff. Like, I can, I can critically solve a lot of problems

1226
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,180
and technical stuff that nobody else can.

1227
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,900
You need to get those kiddos on PC building simulator,

1228
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,140
Prompto, Prompto, you need to get them.

1229
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,420
I think they have it.

1230
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,820
It's just, you know, it's not a fun game they won't play.

1231
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,620
No, there's, you know, I don't know, but they know how to,

1232
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,060
like, at least use a computer.

1233
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,020
My son even accidentally updated to Windows 11.

1234
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,540
So I mean, like, he's, they know what they're doing somewhat.

1235
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:14,820
But it's, yeah, I do find it weird that there's people that

1236
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,420
don't understand how to do certain things in the workplace,

1237
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,500
or like, even just like, regular adults, like, like, like,

1238
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:27,060
our jobs, like most most office jobs, like require knowledge

1239
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,020
of Microsoft, the Microsoft Office products, you know, like,

1240
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,300
you should know how to use Excel.

1241
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,780
There are people that have been in like, some of these

1242
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,340
companies for years that don't know how to use Excel.

1243
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,660
And I'm like, how do you not know how to use Excel?

1244
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,540
It is literally one of the job requirements.

1245
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,660
You literally have had training on it multiple times.

1246
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,900
How do you not know how to do this?

1247
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,380
Because they don't want to know how to do it.

1248
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:49,860
Exactly.

1249
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,580
There's a lot of-

1250
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,900
And they think that if they don't learn how to do it,

1251
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,500
someone else will do it for them.

1252
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,940
And that's what ends up happening.

1253
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,860
And that person is unfortunately me.

1254
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:04,500
It's called, I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts

1255
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,220
where they were talking about willful stupidity or willful

1256
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,740
ignorance like that, where it's easier to say, I don't know

1257
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,700
how to do something and feign it, even if they know how to

1258
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,500
do it, because then it, it pushes it off on someone else

1259
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,220
for them to do.

1260
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,820
Yeah, not to go into the complaining about my work,

1261
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,980
because I could do that for literally hours.

1262
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,220
Um, they, there's a lot of, you'll get a lot of people

1263
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,500
saying, well, um, like when you ask them to do something

1264
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,980
correctly or to just like slow down to check your work

1265
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,860
and stuff, and they literally get, well, I'm busy.

1266
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,620
So I'm just going to do things quickly.

1267
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,940
Not going to ask questions, not going to check my work.

1268
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,700
It's just going to be wrong because I need to get it done.

1269
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,020
I'm so glad that that doesn't fly at my work.

1270
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,900
It's just, it's ridiculous.

1271
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,300
It goes into the people I think that are hired.

1272
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,940
I mean, honestly, people, it's become an ingrained part

1273
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,780
of society and it needs to be dis-engrained.

1274
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,460
There needs to be, you know, let, let them catch the,

1275
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,460
the, the consequences for not doing their job.

1276
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,820
There are none.

1277
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,140
Yeah.

1278
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,780
Unfortunately there are none and it's more of a, it's a

1279
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,500
culture where those type of people fail upwards.

1280
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,740
So, um, Deidre, Deidre on chat says, I had a user come

1281
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,900
in and not know how to shut down or restart their laptop.

1282
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,860
I swear to you on this.

1283
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,340
I told her to reboot and she Google searched how to restart

1284
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:26,980
Windows 10.

1285
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,140
And this was a Gen Z-er.

1286
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,340
This is not your stereotypical, like, okay, boomer type

1287
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,460
of situation.

1288
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,780
And let me, let me pair that with Bobby's comment here.

1289
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,100
This is shaping up to be the first generation where the

1290
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,820
parents know more about how to use computers than their kids.

1291
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,780
I do think there's a part of that though, where it's like,

1292
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,020
well, probably cause touch screens and that whole thing,

1293
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,740
like is going to be the future by the time the kids are in

1294
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,700
the working world.

1295
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,100
I think a lot of the working tools are going to be more

1296
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,380
situated to that platform.

1297
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:58,180
So there's that, but yeah, like, I just keep thinking of

1298
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:04,580
this scene from the, the Star Trek search for Spock.

1299
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,420
Were they not that, that one, it was a Star Trek four.

1300
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,060
I think it was four.

1301
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,420
The one where they went back and got the whales.

1302
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,060
The voyage home?

1303
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,020
No, I don't think it was.

1304
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:14,660
I don't know.

1305
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:18,420
Yeah, it was Star Trek four where Scotty picks up the mouse

1306
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,700
and goes, hello computer.

1307
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,500
And then, oh, a keyboard.

1308
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,140
How quaint.

1309
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,660
I mean, and I want to say like Deidre on mess.

1310
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,180
So like, uh, to be fair and I'm going to give major props

1311
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:34,660
here, at least they took it on themselves to Google search

1312
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,300
how to do it.

1313
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,860
Like, I don't have a problem with someone not knowing

1314
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,580
something, it being very obvious, but you'd be surprised

1315
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,700
the people that don't, if you don't know something that

1316
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,220
they're actually seeking to know the answer, to figure it

1317
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,020
out themselves.

1318
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,700
And I'm telling you right now that, that, you know, trait

1319
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,700
about a person is so rare nowadays.

1320
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,380
It's just, it's ridiculous.

1321
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,180
So like, yeah, it is stupid that you'd have to do that,

1322
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,620
but props for them to like, try to figure it out on their

1323
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:01,940
own.

1324
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,740
So absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.

1325
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,380
We should acknowledge that they tried.

1326
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,020
Absolutely.

1327
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,300
Give them a gold star for that.

1328
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:14,500
You tried, but no, I honestly, yes, you're right.

1329
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,980
At least that person tried to fix the problem themselves

1330
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,900
and research the answer.

1331
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,020
We should, we should acknowledge at least that, at least

1332
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:22,260
that.

1333
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,060
All right.

1334
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,420
Oboe 47, hi, welcome to the station, says transparent

1335
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,140
aluminum, or aluminium, depending on where you're from,

1336
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:35,380
was patented before that movie came out.

1337
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:44,100
And Oboe was a really cool Wraith player who killed us all

1338
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,500
and then was really nice and came in to my chat.

1339
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,660
I went against a Wraith today.

1340
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,460
I got out though.

1341
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:50,500
I'm just kidding.

1342
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,220
All right.

1343
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,620
To which Wraith is old news.

1344
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,660
It's all about Sadako now.

1345
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:58,900
All right.

1346
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,420
Sjoan Hunter Matt says, congrats, you did the bare minimum.

1347
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,140
Yes, very much in that particular case.

1348
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:05,540
All right.

1349
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,700
Anyway, so I wanted to go back to the original comment that

1350
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,740
started this whole derailment, which was the executives

1351
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,740
comment about the layoffs, which still seemed very okay

1352
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,940
boomer to me.

1353
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:26,020
Like, he laid off a team that he didn't put any effort into

1354
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,180
promoting because he doesn't get it.

1355
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,740
Like, he didn't bother to Google.

1356
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:33,780
What is a video game?

1357
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,620
If he had Googled, how much money does the gaming industry

1358
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,420
make? Did he lay off the Hollywood team?

1359
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,380
Because guess what?

1360
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,820
Gaming makes more than Hollywood.

1361
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:43,780
Right.

1362
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,740
Well, basically, he said we have no, they said that we've

1363
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,620
received no clear explanation for why these layoffs had

1364
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,100
to happen.

1365
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:54,180
As far as we could tell, they're not financially necessary

1366
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,460
or rooted in any coherent business plan from our publisher

1367
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:00,340
who has said he expects the company to be larger a year

1368
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:00,840
from now.

1369
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,420
So I guess I don't know.

1370
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,300
We're getting to lay all these people off and pay them

1371
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,820
severance just to hire them back later.

1372
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,620
Is that what we're saying?

1373
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,180
I mean, I don't know.

1374
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,180
Is he mad at, like, the gaming industry or something?

1375
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,260
I mean, you do realize you own Twitch, right?

1376
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:26,980
And Luna.

1377
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:27,480
For now.

1378
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,980
Why don't we talk about something that, like, does anyone

1379
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,740
remember that Twitch has a cloud, Amazon has a cloud platform?

1380
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,580
Does anyone remember that?

1381
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:45,140
Here on Amazon's video game service, video game?

1382
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,140
How often does Amazon like to remind you that Luna, like,

1383
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,660
exists?

1384
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,540
Yes, I know you can go into Prime Gaming and find some

1385
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,340
things here and there.

1386
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,820
I know there's maybe an ad that gets inserted here and there

1387
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:57,140
as well.

1388
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,940
But are they really trying as hard as they ought to?

1389
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,620
I just realized I'm doing the period ads without even

1390
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,660
thinking about it.

1391
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,260
Period.

1392
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:13,700
It just goes to show Amazon is a very siloed company.

1393
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,060
All right.

1394
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:20,340
I can't see.

1395
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:23,460
And Chat says, one reason why I didn't go the PC route for

1396
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,340
gaming is because of accessibility, sifting through menus,

1397
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,660
tweaking, optimization, and upkeep.

1398
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,620
And I remember from your story, I think you came in here

1399
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,860
from one of Dar Sakura Stadia interviews.

1400
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,460
The neat thing about cloud gaming, you know, I don't know

1401
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,020
if we're there yet with all of these, but there's a lot of

1402
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,060
cloud games you could just pick up and go, right?

1403
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,140
You don't have to worry about menus, configuration, or any

1404
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:45,460
of that stuff.

1405
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,180
Just pick up and go.

1406
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,300
I do think there's going to be more and more cloud gaming in

1407
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:49,780
the future.

1408
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:52,580
I just, you know, Google was the wrong company.

1409
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,660
Unfortunately, I think we all recognize that now.

1410
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,260
The right tech, but the wrong company.

1411
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,540
Anyway, let's see.

1412
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,460
Let's move on to another story, which is unfortunately in

1413
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,820
the same kind of realm.

1414
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:12,580
But it's an executive who normally I think this guy has

1415
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,460
his stuff together.

1416
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,780
So I want to dive into these comments a little bit, and this

1417
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,500
has to do with Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox.

1418
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,900
And this is further comment on 343 Industries and what's

1419
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,380
going on with the Halo franchise and all that stuff.

1420
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:30,180
In an interview with IGN, Phil Spencer said, the heart and

1421
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:34,740
soul of Halo is with 343 and the teams that there, and I

1422
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:38,020
have the utmost confidence in the team that's there and

1423
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,140
leading and the plan that they have going forward.

1424
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:45,060
This, of course, after 343 last week was per reports hit

1425
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:48,500
hard by Microsoft's company wide layoffs.

1426
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,540
We don't know exactly how many employees were let go, but

1427
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:54,340
the Halo Infinite team, according to reporting, did see

1428
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,020
significant cuts, which led to some chat online that they

1429
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:01,140
were no longer going to do Halo, to which 343 put out a

1430
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,100
brief statement saying, Halo and Master Chief are here to

1431
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,620
stay. 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo now and

1432
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,660
in the future, including Epic Stories multiplayer and more

1433
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,500
of what makes Halo's great.

1434
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,860
Phil Spencer said the layoffs were an effort by Microsoft

1435
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,620
to position 343 for the future.

1436
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,900
What we're doing now is we want to make sure that leadership

1437
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,540
team is set up with the flexibility to build the plan that

1438
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,580
they need to go build.

1439
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:28,580
Halo will remain critically important to what Xbox is doing

1440
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:32,820
and 343 is critically important to the success of Halo.

1441
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:36,180
Unfortunately, nothing further because a logical follow-up

1442
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,740
question you would ask in that case is, okay, so what is next

1443
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,300
for Halo?

1444
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,380
Phil Spencer said, I'm going to let 343 talk about the plans

1445
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,740
that they have right now.

1446
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:47,700
I expect that we'll be continuing to support and grow Halo

1447
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,900
for as long as the Xbox is a platform for people to play.

1448
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,540
So walking a very safe line there.

1449
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,180
I mean, it's kind of a whole lot of nothing.

1450
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,220
I understand Phil Spencer's in a weird position.

1451
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:04,900
The one thing I don't like that he said is the whole like

1452
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,940
it's positioning the leadership team to move forward with

1453
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:13,060
Halo. How much of this is the leadership team's fault in

1454
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:13,700
the first place?

1455
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,260
I realize he can't say that in a public interview with IGN

1456
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,100
when he's a publicly traded company.

1457
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,740
I just kind of I wonder behind the scenes.

1458
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,780
The wonder behind the scenes, that's all.

1459
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:31,220
All right, let's move on to a simpler time in our next

1460
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,620
segment. I think it is overdue at this point.

1461
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:48,260
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where

1462
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,780
I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell

1463
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,740
you about it.

1464
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,380
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1465
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,460
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick this week?

1466
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,860
Picked words with friends.

1467
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,980
For reasons.

1468
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,060
Well, I mean, actually, go ahead.

1469
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,580
I'll leave my opinion for the end.

1470
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:13,800
Yeah.

1471
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:19,060
Well, I basically I like my word scapes game and I was like,

1472
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,380
you know, this all started with Scrabble.

1473
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,300
And it made me think about words with friends.

1474
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,100
And now we're like on the sequel version or something.

1475
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:29,940
So words with friends was developed by a company called

1476
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,340
New Toy published by Zynga.

1477
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:39,620
And it is basically Scrabble that you can play online with

1478
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:44,980
people. There's also a Solitaire mode that I really enjoyed

1479
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:45,940
the Solitaire mode.

1480
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:51,780
That was kind of my jam, but it was connected to Facebook

1481
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:54,500
or just through regular username contacts.

1482
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:00,580
And then you can also be randomly assigned through smart

1483
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:05,060
matches, you know, there were community matches, you know,

1484
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,100
things like that.

1485
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,260
But it was cross platform when it was released.

1486
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:14,580
It was on iOS, on Windows Phone, Android.

1487
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,220
You could play it on Facebook, Kindle Fire and a Nook.

1488
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:24,180
There was a chat feature that you could use to talk with

1489
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,100
your opponents and other people.

1490
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:32,100
And between 2010 and 2011, it was one of the top ranking

1491
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,700
games in the iOS app store.

1492
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:39,380
There was an ad free and a paid version that had no ads.

1493
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:45,860
In May 2017, words with friends was the most popular mobile

1494
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,140
game in the US.

1495
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:51,540
And then the sequel came out September 2017.

1496
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,180
I mean, it really is basically Scrabble.

1497
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:59,380
It has the Scrabble distribution, the point values, all

1498
01:09:59,380 --> 01:09:59,700
of it.

1499
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,620
It follows the Scrabble dictionary and remind me never to

1500
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:08,500
play with Bobby as in our friends in Southern California,

1501
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,100
because I thought you meant Mr.

1502
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:10,660
Black Wolf.

1503
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,220
No, I mean, I know he did.

1504
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,500
Yeah, Barbara.

1505
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,140
Other Bobby.

1506
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:18,420
Yeah, because she knows legal terms.

1507
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,540
We don't play with her anymore.

1508
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:25,940
But you also have your double letter or triple letter and

1509
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,460
then your double word and triple word.

1510
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:34,500
And then if a player can use all the seven tiles on a single

1511
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,660
play, also known as a bingo in Scrabble, you get 35 bonus

1512
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:44,580
points. I got that once and it was amazing.

1513
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:52,820
So you can also get some different arrangements as you

1514
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,340
play. It can change each time.

1515
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:00,420
You also have a reassign feature and you can also pass your

1516
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:05,060
turn. You can also swap to and you can look up what tiles

1517
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,420
are left in your tile bag.

1518
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:11,780
So yeah, it's a little interesting.

1519
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:15,700
You can get power ups for word clue and word radar and

1520
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,420
things like that.

1521
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,380
And then there was a feature that was temporarily removed.

1522
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:26,820
It was called Hindsight that let a player pay for the

1523
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:30,500
opportunity to see what the highest scoring moves on the

1524
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,220
board were after the play was made.

1525
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,340
But they brought it back.

1526
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:43,140
You can do random opponents and actually what I'm reading,

1527
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:50,420
a lady in Chicago met up, started chatting with an opponent

1528
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,380
from the Netherlands.

1529
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,340
They chatted the whole time and got married three years

1530
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,940
later. Sorry, two years later.

1531
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:58,440
Wow.

1532
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:03,480
Another one in Georgia and Texas.

1533
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,800
Yeah, and there was even one I was reading about an American

1534
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,480
player communicating about an Australian opponent's medical

1535
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:24,360
symptoms and the American, the lady, her husband was a doctor.

1536
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,120
He recommended a hospital visit and it turned out that the

1537
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:35,080
opponent had a 99% blockage close to his heart and actually

1538
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:39,400
on a 2012 episode of the doctors, they got to meet in person.

1539
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:41,900
Wild.

1540
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,240
Yeah, but at any rate, they did do a board game version.

1541
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,440
That's the part that blows my mind.

1542
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,080
I know, right?

1543
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,080
It was a board game called something else.

1544
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,840
Yeah, but they had like a luxe version with the rotating

1545
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:02,040
tile game board and a travel to go edition and the all kinds

1546
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:02,540
of shit.

1547
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,000
I was looking at the video for it rather incredulously.

1548
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,280
And actually, this isn't the only game that Zynga has done

1549
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,240
physical versions of.

1550
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:18,120
There's Draw Something, Cityville edition of Monopoly and some

1551
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,880
kids games based on Farmville.

1552
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:29,960
In 2019, there was a hack of Zynga that compromised details

1553
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:35,960
of 218 million words with friends accounts, including names,

1554
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:40,280
email addresses, login IDs, hashed passwords, password reset

1555
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:44,280
tokens, phone numbers, Facebook IDs, and Zynga IDs.

1556
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,560
So hopefully they were able to get some of that resolved.

1557
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,880
But yeah, that's it.

1558
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,560
All right, words with fiends.

1559
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,760
And I'm seeing mostly the comments in chat are kind of talking

1560
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,520
about like, I can't believe that this game is 10 years old.

1561
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,360
Like, because, you know, as a reminder for the new fans of

1562
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,760
Orange Lawns Radio out there, we might have a new listener

1563
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,400
or two every week.

1564
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,840
In order for a game to qualify as a classic game of the week,

1565
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,360
it has to be at least 10 years older or more, which is funny

1566
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,560
because this show's been on coming up on 21 years.

1567
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,280
So all of the time now in this segment, we're getting games

1568
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,440
where it's like, we literally talked about this game when

1569
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,240
it first came out.

1570
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,760
And now it's a classic game of the week.

1571
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,920
And I think there's people in chat very much feeling that

1572
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,420
this week.

1573
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:40,920
Well, and also just to say, I mean, the game had like a

1574
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,120
rather large impact.

1575
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,880
I mean, that's the other reason I brought it up.

1576
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,440
Oh, no.

1577
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,480
Yeah, mobile games.

1578
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,560
This is the one everyone was playing.

1579
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,800
Well, yeah, it's just earlier in the show, and I was talking

1580
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,160
about NBA All World.

1581
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,720
When I was talking about NBA All World, I was saying, you

1582
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:57,800
know, games that work very well from the cell phone are games

1583
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,320
that are designed with that cell phone environment and what

1584
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,000
your phone can and can't do in mind.

1585
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,480
And ironically, and I didn't even realize this.

1586
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,400
I mean, I knew what you picked earlier in the day, but I

1587
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,320
didn't realize when I was saying those comments is that

1588
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,680
this actually really plays right into that.

1589
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,240
Words with Friends is a great example of really one of the,

1590
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,560
I don't want to say one of the earliest, let's put it that

1591
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,200
way, mobile games that really did that.

1592
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:22,120
It did something on your mobile device, whether it's an iPad,

1593
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,360
iPhone, Android, you name it.

1594
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,120
It did it on that device that like a port of Sonic the

1595
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,040
Hedgehog doesn't do the same way.

1596
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,720
It made a uniquely mobile experience.

1597
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,400
Well, yeah, this is the kind of game that lends itself very

1598
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:44,600
well to a touch experience, which I mean, for me, like I

1599
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,200
said, it was always the Solitaire mode.

1600
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,040
That was my favorite thing.

1601
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,800
And it was actually Words with Friends 2 that had that sort

1602
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,160
of linked circle mode, the kind of like a crossword-ish sort

1603
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,280
of thing, but you had to move the letters to unscrabble them

1604
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,760
and make the words with the given letters.

1605
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:09,800
That led me to Wordscapes, which I'm still pretty addicted to.

1606
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,120
I don't even know what level I am on that thing anymore.

1607
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,960
But in the tens of thousands, I'll put it that way.

1608
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,720
I can't see in chat says up there with Farmville and Wordle.

1609
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,840
I mean, honestly, yeah.

1610
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,440
My mother did Farmville.

1611
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,200
I was like, no.

1612
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,400
And that's exactly it.

1613
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,480
Words with Friends is one of those games where it's like,

1614
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,400
you could play that with a grandparent, depending on your

1615
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,440
family makeup or what have you.

1616
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,880
But if they made Wordle with Friends.

1617
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,720
I'm sure someone's already trying to jump on that idea if

1618
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,760
they haven't already.

1619
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,840
But my point still stands.

1620
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,640
This also was a hugely important game because for many

1621
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,520
people, it was the first game that they were playing with

1622
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:51,640
somebody a generation or two older than them that maybe

1623
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,120
otherwise wasn't playing a lot of games, wasn't interested

1624
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:57,320
in playing Sonic, Mario Kart, whatever it is.

1625
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,680
But will Grandma, Grandpa play Word with Friends?

1626
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah.

1627
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,600
So that's been a hugely transformative thing for some

1628
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:04,920
people.

1629
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:11,000
So and I look at it as sort of a return to the simplicity

1630
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,040
of retro games.

1631
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,880
You know, our retro games, they may have been kind of

1632
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,920
difficult to play, but they were relatively simple to play.

1633
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,480
And games like this, you know, Farmville thing, whatever,

1634
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,120
they're all fairly simplistic in a similar way.

1635
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And something that would be really easy for someone to

1636
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,480
lose track of time.

1637
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,000
Or it would play into that addictive personality who like,

1638
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,200
no, I need to buy this thing in here so I can do this other

1639
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,800
thing in the game and be better at it.

1640
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,560
It doesn't make you better at it.

1641
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,200
But that was my thought.

1642
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:50,200
So let's see going other in chat.

1643
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,040
I know you acknowledge this in chat, but I want to say this

1644
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,320
for the sake of the podcast listeners.

1645
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,280
DJ Roma S said, thanks to your classic game last week.

1646
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,840
I went and bought Star Ocean R for Switch.

1647
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,280
That's another impact the classic game segment has sometimes

1648
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,760
is like, hey, sometimes it makes you miss a game and you

1649
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,560
want to go check it out.

1650
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,120
So your impact, Dark Soccer, your impact.

1651
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,200
I'm very impactful.

1652
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,400
Well, I did actually.

1653
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,960
I'm getting back to putting like my just a couple of

1654
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,400
screenshots from my retro stream.

1655
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:25,000
So I did put up a couple of really nice pictures from playing

1656
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,120
Star Ocean last night.

1657
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,120
Sgio100Matt says, true story, though.

1658
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,000
My fiancé said that one of the things that attracted her

1659
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,960
to me initially was when I beat her the one time in Words

1660
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,800
with Friends when we started dating.

1661
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,280
That's cute.

1662
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,240
Well, I told you what happened when I moved out here.

1663
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,040
Dan said I had to play through Strider and Castlevania

1664
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:44,840
Symphony of the Night.

1665
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,720
And I did.

1666
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,760
And I beat Strider.

1667
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,040
Yeah, video games are great for bringing people together.

1668
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:55,560
Alan and I, we were long distance dating, but we were like

1669
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,280
medium distance dating, which means he lived in South

1670
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,080
San Francisco.

1671
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,840
I lived here in Sacramento, which, you know.

1672
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:02,520
Yeah, exactly.

1673
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,200
Which if you're not from here, that's like a two and a

1674
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,720
half hour drive on a good night, maybe three and a half

1675
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,560
if one of the bridges is fucked.

1676
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,680
But, you know, I would go see him on the weekend.

1677
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,960
But during the week we would play World of Warcraft together

1678
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,520
and it was a way and we could actually quest together.

1679
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,080
So it's like we could hang out together in a virtual.

1680
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:21,960
Isn't that cute?

1681
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,640
It's all playing well together.

1682
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:27,720
I mean, I don't miss well, but I miss us all playing the

1683
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,680
same game together.

1684
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,400
Yeah, I hear that.

1685
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,440
Yeah, that's what makes it by daylight fun when it works

1686
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,680
out that, you know, we all hop on that for, you know, a

1687
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,000
night.

1688
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,760
I'm planning on doing killer tonight.

1689
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,400
Oh, people convince me otherwise.

1690
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,280
All right, we'll see.

1691
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,920
I may be around, but I actually have to work tomorrow.

1692
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,360
Man, these three day weekends spoil me.

1693
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:46,920
All right.

1694
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,080
This is actually officially starting my work week.

1695
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,560
So my days off for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

1696
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,080
Ah, gotcha.

1697
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,640
Yeah.

1698
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:53,960
All right.

1699
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,920
Well, let's get into some other news headlines.

1700
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,080
I mentioned there's not a whole lot going on in the gaming

1701
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,760
world this week, especially compared to other weeks.

1702
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,400
But we do have a few quick rapid fire headlines to talk

1703
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:03,640
about.

1704
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,920
So let's go to Loki first.

1705
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,880
Yeah, since we've been talking about Ubisoft and all the

1706
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,120
games are canceling, let's talk about some of the games

1707
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,720
that they're reportedly working on, or at least rumors

1708
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,440
are working on.

1709
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,440
One of those being some new games in the Far Cry franchise,

1710
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:26,440
including a mainline Far Cry 7 and also a multiplayer Far

1711
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:30,200
Cry game, live service game or something like that.

1712
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,320
Of course, they're not going to comment on rumor and

1713
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:41,560
speculation, so I guess we'll wait until we find out what's

1714
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,520
going to be coming out.

1715
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,440
All right, cool.

1716
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,920
One of the rumors of part of that, though, actually was

1717
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,720
that it is going to be using the same engine, apparently,

1718
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,760
as their open world Star Wars game, which I forgot that

1719
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,040
they have a Star Wars game.

1720
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,240
So because you're not going to see it for years and years

1721
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,720
longer still, probably, I guess.

1722
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:01,960
Yeah.

1723
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,040
Then we've got some TV news, including that Phoebe Waller

1724
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:13,640
Bridge is set to be producing a Tomb Raider TV series for

1725
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:18,600
Amazon. So that'll be interesting if that ends up happening.

1726
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,160
And then I just real quick.

1727
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,760
A Tomb Raider TV series is fascinating to me, and I wonder

1728
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,800
if it would be a serial, like if it would be the Adventure

1729
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,160
of the Week type of drama.

1730
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,800
Like, what was that show called?

1731
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,400
Relic Hunter or so it was one of those.

1732
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,440
It was like really bad over the top, like Xeno Warrior Princess

1733
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,600
Hercules. It was called Relic Hunter or something.

1734
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,440
Somebody in chat might know what I'm talking about.

1735
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,280
I wonder if that's where they're going to go a Tomb Raider.

1736
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:44,040
Please go.

1737
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,440
Please bring back Xeno Warrior Princess.

1738
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,120
That's basically what I'm saying.

1739
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,440
Basically.

1740
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:52,520
Yeah.

1741
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,640
I don't know if it's going to be bad.

1742
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,360
Oh, my God.

1743
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,200
Rama. Rama and I on the same wavelength.

1744
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:56,680
That is it.

1745
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:56,920
Yep.

1746
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,040
We already had a Tomb Raider series.

1747
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,880
It's called Relic Hunter with Tia Carrere.

1748
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,440
That was it.

1749
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:01,640
It was Tia Carrere's show.

1750
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:02,600
Fuck.

1751
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,400
She was amazing.

1752
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,080
She's not dead, but we don't see her in a lot of stuff

1753
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,640
anymore.

1754
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,360
Tia Carrere.

1755
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:10,520
That's it.

1756
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,240
That's the tweet.

1757
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:11,800
Tia Carrere.

1758
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,320
All right.

1759
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,440
And then not surprisingly, especially after the great

1760
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,520
reception that the show's gotten already, Last of Us has

1761
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,360
been renewed for a second season.

1762
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,200
Shocking.

1763
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:26,920
No words.

1764
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,160
Yeah.

1765
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,560
Nobody's surprised by that.

1766
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,000
Well, trailer.

1767
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,640
If it was on Netflix, it would have been canceled already.

1768
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,360
I guess shocking that, hey, we're actually having some

1769
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,680
video game media that sticks around these days.

1770
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,640
Not all of it does.

1771
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,560
Hello, Resident Evil, speaking of Netflix.

1772
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,600
But to be fair, Castlevania, the anime did very well on

1773
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,240
Netflix.

1774
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:50,840
So there's some video game media that's doing all right.

1775
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,200
So congrats to Last of Us.

1776
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,240
And to be fair, I heard that Resident Evil show was not

1777
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:55,880
good either.

1778
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,080
So I guess that's fine.

1779
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,200
You win some, you lose some.

1780
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,400
Yeah.

1781
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:01,960
All right.

1782
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:02,440
Moving on.

1783
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,080
Dark Sakura.

1784
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,960
So wait, is this really mine?

1785
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:15,880
Yeah, I think it's okay.

1786
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:16,360
Yeah.

1787
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,160
I don't follow these, so I was surprised.

1788
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:25,160
There's going to be another Splatfest the weekend of

1789
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,360
February 11th.

1790
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,080
It's going to ask if you like dark chocolate, milk chocolate,

1791
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,360
or white chocolate.

1792
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,520
White chocolate isn't chocolate, so they're going to lose.

1793
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,960
That's why I thought you would be good for this one, because

1794
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,840
I knew you would have something to say on the debate itself.

1795
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,400
White chocolate is like the mayo of chocolate.

1796
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,400
No, white chocolate is literally milk fat from making chocolate.

1797
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,200
It is the refuse in chocolate making.

1798
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,520
Alan hates it, too.

1799
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,920
I don't mind it, but I would absolutely be team milk chocolate

1800
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,640
in this fight.

1801
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,200
No question.

1802
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,200
The purpose of white chocolate is a flavoring vehicle for

1803
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,400
other flavors, perhaps, like in my Kit Kats.

1804
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,600
Other than that, it is not chocolate.

1805
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,280
It is a vehicle and refuse.

1806
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,360
Or if for some reason you wanted to dye your chocolate a

1807
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:22,280
color that is not brown, perhaps white chocolate would be

1808
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,960
helpful. That's about it.

1809
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,080
No, because it would still be that fake white chocolate

1810
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,680
sugar fat flavor.

1811
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:38,120
Anyway, so yeah, this is starting on February 11th and

1812
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,040
going on through February 13th.

1813
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,600
So go team dark chocolate.

1814
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:46,520
Dark Tetsuya and Orange Rite are with you on team dark chocolate.

1815
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,400
Orange Rite says white chocolate will be the paper of

1816
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:49,880
this one.

1817
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:55,720
I can't see suggests Oreos, Hershey's Hugs and Bark for, I

1818
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,920
guess, white chocolate.

1819
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,680
So yeah, white chocolate is never eaten alone.

1820
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,840
It's always like dark soccer said, it's a vehicle for

1821
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,040
something yummier.

1822
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,140
All right.

1823
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:14,060
Moving on, one other rapid storyline here is about Arcade

1824
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,420
OneUps latest announcement.

1825
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:18,460
They have announced a new Star Wars cabinet, but I was like,

1826
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,020
wait a minute.

1827
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,940
They've already released a Star Wars cabinet.

1828
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,060
Indeed, they have.

1829
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,540
So that's why I put this one in rapid fire news, because all

1830
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:27,020
this is it's a 40th anniversary cabinet.

1831
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,060
It's going to be $600.

1832
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:32,060
It does have the newer look to it where you actually have the

1833
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,740
coin door look on the front.

1834
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:36,860
Like, for instance, a lot of the quote unquote older machines,

1835
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,420
which, like, Tron is only a year old, but now they're changing

1836
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,620
this front panel to look like a fake coin door.

1837
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,780
So the new Star Wars machines are going to have that coin

1838
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:47,340
door look on it in part.

1839
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:50,780
Unfortunately, I don't hear that it has any new games in it.

1840
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,300
It's still just the same three games.

1841
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:55,340
But of course, what other games can you put in a full size

1842
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:56,220
cabinet or something?

1843
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,900
It is full cup.

1844
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,180
No, because it has a riser.

1845
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,100
So it's not a full size machine.

1846
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,300
Yeah, but it does have that same flight yoke.

1847
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,220
I don't know if maybe they made improvements to the yoke,

1848
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,700
because I know some people are not fans of that.

1849
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,540
So there's that.

1850
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,620
So if you want to pick up one of those, you can at the Arcade

1851
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:19,020
OneUp website, but I'm thinking a lot of folks that were

1852
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,900
interested in the Star Wars cab probably already picked it

1853
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:25,260
up. But if you really want the new artwork, there you go.

1854
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:30,780
All right, let's get back into just another couple quick

1855
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:31,660
headlines.

1856
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:33,820
We're going to open it up pretty soon to your phone calls

1857
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:34,620
and feedback.

1858
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,020
If you want to give us a call live, you can head on over

1859
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:40,860
to our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1860
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:44,540
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord and join the green room.

1861
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,260
And that's where we'll be looking for any potential callers

1862
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:52,060
tonight. Meanwhile, let's get to some world release.

1863
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,820
I'm sorry, we didn't cover release dates yet.

1864
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,860
We should probably do that.

1865
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:56,620
And then we'll get into a couple last headlines here.

1866
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,740
So let's do release dates first.

1867
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,020
Loki in the US.

1868
01:26:59,020 --> 01:26:59,660
All right.

1869
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:04,060
So in the US, we have backfire wall on PC, PlayStation 4,

1870
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:07,100
PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1871
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,460

1872
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,380
8-bit adventures on PC.

01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,340
Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition on Xbox One and Xbox

1874
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:17,740
Series.

1875
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,300
Powerwashing Simulator.

1876
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,980
I guess it's Powerwash Simulator.

1877
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:25,500
That's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1878
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,620
Also that wonderful Tomb Raider DLC coming out this week

1879
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:28,940
as well.

1880
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:29,820
Can't wait to play that.

1881
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:38,220
We have Raiden 4 Cross Mikado Remix on whatever Raiden,

1882
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,980
Raiden, tomato, tomato.

1883
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:41,500
No, it's Raiden.

1884
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,260
Fine.

1885
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,060
It's Raiden.

1886
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:49,100
That is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

1887
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,780

1888

1889
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,860
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1890
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:02,780
And We Were Here Forever, the DMV simulator.

1891
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:05,580
No, I don't know what that is, but it's a puzzle adventure

1892
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:09,180
game that's on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

1893
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,060
Xbox Series.

1894
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,940
And oh, a couple more.

1895
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:15,420
Actually, I was really close to importing that game for

1896
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:18,300
the record, except it's Raiden 3, which is like the weakest

1897
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,420
one in the series.

1898
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,180
But the music is amazing.

1899
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,300
Oh, this one says it's four.

1900
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,140
I said it was four.

1901
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:27,740
The Playasia one said Raiden 3.

1902
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:28,940
I'll have to double check it.

1903
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:31,020
Yeah, it's four.

1904
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:31,740
Yeah, it looks like.

1905
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:36,700
And then we've got Football Manager 2023 on PlayStation 5,

1906
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:40,700
Rhythm Sprout on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

1907
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:45,660

01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:57,660
Deliver Us Mars on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

1911
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,180
One, Xbox Series.

1912
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,980
Fashion Police Squad getting its console release on

1913
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,900
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

1914
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:06,860
Xbox Series.

1915
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:10,220
Life is Strange 2 on Nintendo Switch.

1916
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:14,460
Puzzle Bubbles slash Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition and

1917
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:20,780
Puzzle Bubble 3 and slash Bust-A-Move 3 S Tribute on PC,

1918
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,500
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1919
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:31,420
We have Helvelti on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1920
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:35,980
Joe Wander and the Enigmatic Adventures on PC, PlayStation

1921
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,140
5 and Xbox Series.

1922
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:38,780
And that is it.

1923
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:40,140
All right.

1924
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:43,420
Well, Japan's release calendar is looking a little smaller.

1925
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,300
If we go over to Japan and check out the Nintendo Switch,

1926
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,860
there's some accessories, but they're all third party.

1927
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:51,180
Like if you really want a Doraemon pouch for your Switch,

1928
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,860
cool, you can get that this week.

1929
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:55,260
But as far as games go, there's just one for the Switch this

1930
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:56,460
week on February 2nd.

1931
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,700
Life in Willowdale Farm Adventures.

1932
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,580
And that's a multilingual release that's coming out.

1933
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,580
There's also a Doraemon wireless controller.

1934
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,580
Again, as long as we're talking about third party shit.

1935
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,060
But I seem to recall that there was a Doraemon game in last

1936
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:08,860
week's releases.

1937
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,780
So I mean, this is pretty well timed, I suppose.

1938
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,220
Flying over to the PlayStation 5, guess what?

1939
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:17,900
Nothing until the Wizard game comes out on February 7th

1940
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,780
in Japan, because I believe that is a worldwide release with

1941
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:21,500
everything else.

1942
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:27,420
Otherwise, yeah, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.

1943
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:28,700
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1944
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:32,860
I think you're muted.

1945
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,700
A hard mute on Discord because I see the icon.

1946
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:39,100
Well, it's not even a worthwhile game to talk about.

1947
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:43,740
It's a SpongeBob SquarePants cosmic shake on the 31st.

1948
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:46,540
Hey, I love SpongeBob, but I don't play the games.

1949
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:49,420
Also, for the record, for a certain game that is coming out

1950
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,820
in February, I'm not going to mention it at all.

1951
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,300
All right, moving on.

1952
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,700
Let's get into a couple of quick headlines, and then we're

1953
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,700
going to wrap it all up here.

1954
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:01,660
See if there's some phone calls.

1955
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,420
Let's go to Loki.

1956
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:09,260
Yeah, so a judge has blocked Microsoft's request to pause

1957
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:16,620
a lawsuit brought by the Alito law firm and Joseph

1958
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,900
Saveri law firm on behalf of their plaintiffs, which are

1959
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:25,340
some gamers, I guess, who were basically trying to block

1960
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:30,060
the whole acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft,

1961
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,900
saying that it's anti-competitive.

1962
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:37,420
So I guess this is going to be going forward on top of all

1963
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:40,140
of the other stuff that they're facing with the antitrust

1964
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,820
things. I don't see where individual gamers really get to

1965
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:48,220
have a say in which acquisitions happen or not, but okay.

1966
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,220
I guess we'll see what happens.

1967
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,500
Just another day in the courtroom, right?

1968
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,860
It just seems like it's a bit ridiculous.

1969
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:05,900
You would think that, I get where they're saying

1970
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:11,580
anti-competitive and stuff, but at the same time, how do

1971
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,740
you really prove damages from that?

1972
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,540
It just doesn't make any sense how you can say, oh, well,

1973
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,620
this is going to harm me specifically.

1974
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,580
It's like, well.

1975
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,660
Well, and it's also just really reductive with what the

1976
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:26,540
antitrust process is supposed to do anyway.

1977
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,420
So it's basically a bunch of gamers saying, we don't trust

1978
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,940
the government to do anything about it.

1979
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,700
So we're taking matters into our own hands.

1980
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:35,340
And then essentially a different branch of the government

1981
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:39,820
judicial is stepping in and saying, no, that's basically

1982
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:39,980
what it is.

1983
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:43,500
In this case, they're saying yes, because they're letting

1984
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,140
it go forward.

1985
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,500
They're blocking Microsoft.

1986
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:45,660
Okay.

1987
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,060
So let the circus begin, I guess.

1988
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,660
I don't see how it goes anywhere.

1989
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,660
Again, this is what the antitrust process is supposed to

1990
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:56,940
do. This is silly.

1991
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:58,620
It's dumb.

1992
01:32:58,620 --> 01:32:58,860
Yeah.

1993
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:01,500
Last story tonight.

1994
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,060
Dark Sakura.

1995
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:12,700
So there is a streamer in Japan known as Mote Kimaru, who

1996
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:17,100
basically has tetra fish that play video games, like a lot

1997
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:24,140
of Pokemon, for example, using motion sensor and like a

1998
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:24,860
motion board.

1999
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:30,060
Well, and that by itself is actually kind of cool.

2000
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,860
And his fish are pretty good at it, apparently.

2001
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:36,540
But at one time while he was live streaming Pokemon, he had

2002
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,860
stepped away for a break and the game had crashed.

2003
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:43,020
And then it went back to the home screen like it does.

2004
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:47,100
And the fish kept on swimming because fish swim.

2005
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,940
And then during the next seven hours, the fish managed to

2006
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:56,540
change the name of the Switch account twice, logged into

2007
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,660
the Nintendo store.

2008
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:01,100
They checked legal terms and conditions, downloaded a new

2009
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:05,100
avatar, set up a PayPal account, sent an email to confirm

2010
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:10,220
and a video on the live stream actually showed this.

2011
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:17,500
And they were also seen adding 500 yen to Mote Kimaru's

2012
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,460
Switch account from his credit card.

2013
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,460
And it also exposes credit card details.

2014
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:31,500
Um, and so at this point, you know, people were just all

2015
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,780
on about it.

2016
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:36,940
And he said that that afterwards he's contacted Nintendo

2017
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:41,180
to to see what happened and ask for a refund of his, you

2018
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:44,060
know, four bucks, 500 yen.

2019
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,820
Is this the plot of Sharknado 6?

2020
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,140
Like Sharknado shopping spree at the mall?

2021
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:49,980
Tetranado.

2022
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:51,260
There you go.

2023
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:52,620
Tetranado.

2024
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,980
And Nintendo, of course, hasn't said anything, but I mean,

2025
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,580
this went to CNN.

2026
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:03,980
So I mean, it's it's oddly enough.

2027
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,620
And I mean, and it literally I'm looking at this screenshot

2028
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:10,860
from from his Twitch and it's it's.

2029
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,400
Yeah.

2030
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:13,840
Wow.

2031
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:19,740
Oboe 47 in chat says it wasn't a new release of Skyrim.

2032
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:22,620
No, I mean, the fish probably could have bought

2033
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,940
that on the Switch through the store place.

2034
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:28,940
I mean, it would have had to have been just a perfect swim

2035
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:36,940
storm, a perfect a perfect current to get that series of

2036
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:37,820
events to happen.

2037
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:40,860
At least he has a video proof that he had nothing to do

2038
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,360
with it.

2039
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,860
Or as you might say, fish roe duh.

2040
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,340
Fish roe duh.

2041
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:51,340
Huh?

2042
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:52,380
It's the Elder Scrolls joke.

2043
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,100
Forget it.

2044
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:53,600
All right.

2045
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:55,260
Yeah, I don't like Elder Scrolls.

2046
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,900
I don't get it at all.

2047
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:58,620
Sorry.

2048
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,140
Just look in chat.

2049
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,340
Everybody's booing me.

2050
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:01,840
All right.

2051
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:02,960
Sorry.

2052
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,980
The spirit of Drewnami had possessed me for a moment.

2053
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:07,120
All right.

2054
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,940
Let's get to the listener roundtable where we invite you

2055
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,700
all to participate along with the show.

2056
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,340
If you have questions for us, obviously, we have a little

2057
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,140
extra time tonight.

2058
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,220
I'm happy to take questions in our chat over at

2059
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:20,540
twitch.tv slash vog network.

2060
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,900
We also at this point of the show usually look for any

2061
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:28,700
emails. I feel like it's been dry January in our inbox, but

2062
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,580
I didn't even check.

2063
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,260
That's how much I forgot about it.

2064
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,700
I don't think anything's there.

2065
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:33,580
Go ahead and look again.

2066
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:37,020
But again, if you want to send us an email, participate.

2067
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,940
Do I need to spell it for you?

2068
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:42,700
Participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send

2069
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:43,180
your email.

2070
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:46,060
At this point, I want someone to send me an email just to

2071
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:46,860
make sure it works.

2072
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,860
We got something about the audio fiction world cup.

2073
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:52,380
It's junk.

2074
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:55,260
Unfortunately, the spammers have our new address now.

2075
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,380
We've hardly gotten any spam.

2076
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:58,540
Yeah.

2077
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:59,660
Not compared to the old box.

2078
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:01,020
The old mailbox was way worse.

2079
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,660
I'm pretty sure somebody hate signed us up for a bunch of

2080
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,980
stuff because we dare to be people with a podcast when

2081
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,660
podcast was new.

2082
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,900
So because we're better than everybody, what are you talking

2083
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:11,900
about? And so humble.

2084
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:13,500
Let's see.

2085
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:16,060
Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories.

2086
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,340
It's been a heck of a slow news week.

2087
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,340
I think we covered just about everything, but I will check

2088
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:22,060
anyway. How hell we had breaking news earlier in the show.

2089
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:23,900
I don't think so.

2090
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,540
I didn't see anything.

2091
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,620
I mean, it's not really much of a story.

2092
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:31,260
There was a 30 second clip.

2093
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:35,980
I guess it's a TV spot or something showing a little bit

2094
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:40,220
more of the scene in the Mario movie with Donkey Kong and

2095
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:44,300
Mario and shocker Donkey Kong, voiced by Seth Rogan.

2096
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,300
Sounds like Seth Rogan.

2097
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:52,220
You don't say he did not put on a monkey accent.

2098
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:58,860
So yeah, it's very disappointing that it's very not authentic

2099
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:02,300
to the voice of Donkey calling that we've grown to know and

2100
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,580
love all of the dialogue that Donkey Kong is bless us with

2101
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,780
in the myriad of games that he's been out in.

2102
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:14,140
Are you saying that they're setting up for a sequel from

2103
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:15,420
based on a 30 second clip?

2104
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:18,380
They show cat Mario.

2105
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:19,900
I mean, that's kind of funny.

2106
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,420
I mean, the Mario movie looks cute.

2107
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:24,060
I got to go see it.

2108
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:24,700
I mean, yeah.

2109
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,940
She hold 10 and chat says, is Loki going to play the new

2110
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,700
Golden Eye game pass update?

2111
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,620
You know, Golden Eye 007.

2112
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:32,940
What?

2113
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,180
Honestly, it's a miracle that that game came out.

2114
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:37,260
When you consider all the licensing that went into it.

2115
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:40,540
It was a Nintendo 64 game made by a now owned by Microsoft

2116
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:45,660
company, Rare, with celebrity likeness of Pierce Brosnan,

2117
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,780
with a property that belongs to the Bond estate.

2118
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,660
Like, do you know how many people had to sign off on this

2119
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,940
game getting released?

2120
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,940
So now it's here.

2121
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:58,140
And I mean, has it?

2122
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,180
Loki, did you check it out yet?

2123
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:01,420
It's on my to do list, but I didn't get to it this week.

2124
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:03,340
I don't really have any nostalgia for it.

2125
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:05,820
I've played it a little bit with friends long time ago,

2126
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,300
back in the Nintendo 64, but I don't really have any

2127
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,260
nostalgia for it.

2128
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:14,300
So I hear that the controls on the Switch aren't great.

2129
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,180
You need to change those.

2130
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:20,620
But the Xbox couldn't be good.

2131
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:21,740
Like the old one did.

2132
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:28,300
I wonder if it plays at a higher frame rate or what happens

2133
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,860
now. I want to check it out out of morbid curiosity, but

2134
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:33,020
I'm kind of in the boat with Loki to be honest.

2135
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:35,660
I don't have the same emotional attachment to Golden

2136
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:39,980
like most of you do, because when that game came out, if I

2137
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:43,180
was playing a Nintendo 64, I tell you it was Mario Kart,

2138
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:46,540
Mario Kart 64 and nothing but like, that was the only game

2139
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:49,980
we ever played in the college dorm on Nintendo 64.

2140
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:52,620
Hell, even my Super Nintendo and the old school Mario Kart

2141
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,980
was played.

2142
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:57,740
But as far as shooters go, we were playing Duke Nukem at

2143
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:59,820
that time, because that was right around the same time when

2144
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:04,620
Duke Nukem was on PC, and we were able to play because the

2145
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,140
old computers had the modems.

2146
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,300
And so I could call my neighbor in the dorm.

2147
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:12,620
It was just before like wired internet and dorms became big,

2148
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:13,820
but you would call through the phone light.

2149
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:16,460
We would play Duke Nukem across the phone.

2150
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,860
And so we kind of did that instead of Goldeneye.

2151
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:23,100
So when I was in college, it was just Doom.

2152
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,820
Yeah, Doom, Doom as well.

2153
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:28,620
I was going to say Doom 2, but I meant Doom also, but

2154
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:29,420
sometimes Doom 2.

2155
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:31,260
No, for us, it was Doom.

2156
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,180
I think when did Doom 2 come out?

2157
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:33,980
I have to remember.

2158
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:41,260
But OK, why is it not giving me the right date for Doom 2?

2159
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,620
OK, actually, no.

2160
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:46,540
Yeah, we were doing Doom 2 because that was 1994.

2161
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:49,100
And they weren't that far apart, the first two.

2162
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:49,740
Yeah.

2163
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:51,420
And Hexen was the other thing.

2164
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:55,020
But we didn't I didn't get to play Duke Nukem until we had a

2165
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:58,940
LAN party at Mobicon in 1996.

2166
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:04,780
My friends, my friends at Sonoma State, they got T1 internet,

2167
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:08,140
which was like the high speed fucking remember that?

2168
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:11,100
That was like if you had T1 internet, you were rich, right?

2169
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,380
So do you have a T1?

2170
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:12,700
Yeah.

2171
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:13,820
You have a T3?

2172
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:16,620
So they got T1 internet in their dorms.

2173
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:18,700
So they started the Quake server.

2174
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,020
And then that became the game we all played.

2175
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:25,100
I would call into their server over the T1 or whatever from

2176
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:27,100
my thing, and we would all fucking play the shit out of

2177
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:30,300
Quake and like the early Team Fortress mods and those types

2178
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:30,800
of things.

2179
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:35,580
When we had our Dreamcast in the ethernet adapter, Dan was

2180
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:39,980
really into playing Quake on our Dreamcast for a hot minute.

2181
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:41,900
Since we couldn't play PSO.

2182
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:43,180
So dumb.

2183
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:47,820
Like, why would they put out an online game that has the

2184
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:52,060
online capability, but disable the thing that makes it go

2185
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:52,460
online?

2186
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,820
DarkTitius says, can we get a Quake night going?

2187
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:57,740
I think the remaster has cross play.

2188
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,460
I'd be in.

2189
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:58,940
I play.

2190
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:01,420
So me, DarkTitsia, can we get like two other people to do

2191
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:03,580
it? Because then I only if we do ASCII Quake.

2192
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,660
What the fuck is ASCII Quake?

2193
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:07,740
It's in Quake.

2194
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,580
There is a mode to play it in ASCII.

2195
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:10,860
Killi.

2196
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:11,740
I didn't know that.

2197
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:15,180
I don't know if the remake because I believe I have done

2198
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:17,420
Quake as a classic game of the month and spoke on this at

2199
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:17,740
length.

2200
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:22,220
I think somebody was asking me earlier today about something

2201
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,980
I said last week on this show.

2202
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:25,340
And I was like, what was I talking about?

2203
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:25,900
I don't remember.

2204
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,980
I don't remember what we talk about in this program.

2205
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:30,540
Are you serious?

2206
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:32,860
Yeah, it was actually sorry.

2207
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:37,180
Yeah, there was Quake live and then Quake 2 had text mode.

2208
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:41,340
I remember the console was built into Quake, but yeah.

2209
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,420
Yeah, it was.

2210
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:44,220
Okay, nevermind.

2211
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:45,100
Yeah, it was.

2212
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:45,580
It was.

2213
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,660
I'm sorry, it was a mod.

2214
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:50,300
My apologies.

2215
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:50,780
It was a mod.

2216
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:55,260
So, but yeah, it's also very disorienting, but I played

2217
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:57,100
and I'm not fond of it.

2218
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:57,660
But Dr.

2219
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:00,060
Tua, yes, if we could get the people, I'd so be down for

2220
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,900
a Quake just for fun.

2221
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:06,220
So because the remake is really most people got it for free

2222
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,980
at some point one way or another.

2223
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,540
Is it maybe it's still free for all I know.

2224
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:13,820
I don't know, but I'm sure it's on game pass if nothing else.

2225
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,340
So all right.

2226
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:20,060
Well, with that in the chat, I did link a video to text

2227
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:20,460
Quake.

2228
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:24,060
Let me see this, because I'm not sure I've ever actually

2229
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,620
and we have the time, so I might as well take a look.

2230
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:28,060
Oh, God, this looks terrible.

2231
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:32,220
But like, doesn't it in one of those, like, I'm gonna actually

2232
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:34,140
fast forward a little bit here in the clip so we can actually

2233
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,900
see this dark soccer.

2234
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,500
This actually looks worse.

2235
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:42,460
And to describe what I'm seeing for the podcast listeners

2236
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:46,460
is that it literally is the entire screen is made up of

2237
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:48,780
ASCII characters, meaning like, you know, text characters

2238
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:50,140
with the keyboard and things like that.

2239
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,940
If you're not familiar with the term ASCII, but it's like,

2240
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,180
it's one of those.

2241
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:55,500
You know what?

2242
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,900
It reminds me of, like, those pictures where, like, if you

2243
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,020
stand way back in the room, then you can tell what it is.

2244
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:02,940
But if you're looking close up, you see that.

2245
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:03,900
Do you see the sailboat?

2246
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:09,020
Not those scooter, but similar.

2247
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:09,500
Yes.

2248
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:10,780
Similar to that vibe.

2249
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:11,280
Yes.

2250
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,380
How could you possibly play a video game like this?

2251
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:16,620
Yeah.

2252
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,700
I'm getting a headache watching that.

2253
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,340
Same.

2254
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:20,380
Yeah, it is the novelty.

2255
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:21,660
All right.

2256
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:23,100
I like to play Gatchamon Quake.

2257
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:27,900
Well, with that, we are at the end of the program, so I'm

2258
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,900
going to go around and get everybody's final thought and

2259
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:30,460
wrap things up.

2260
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:32,700
But I do want to say thank you very much for listening to

2261
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:32,940
the show.

2262
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,940
I know it was a little shorter tonight, but sometimes there

2263
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,540
just isn't as much gaming news.

2264
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,460
I hope everybody had a wonderful week.

2265
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:39,740
I hope you have a great week ahead.

2266
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:42,300
I hope you're enjoying playing things, whether it's new

2267
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:45,900
surprise releases like HiFi Rush or, you know, or Forespoken,

2268
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,700
something you were waiting for, or just the same old shit.

2269
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,180
If you're still playing Dead by Daylight, that is fine, too,

2270
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:51,980
or whatever it is.

2271
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:54,700
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio,

2272
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:55,900
tell a friend or two about the show.

2273
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:57,660
Help us spread the word because we are the show where

2274
01:44:57,660 --> 01:44:59,980
every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here to

2275
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:00,860
put out on air.

2276
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:03,500
So a nice five-star review wherever you found this show

2277
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,620
goes an awful long way.

2278
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:09,340
A site like iTunes or Spotify helps an awful lot, and we

2279
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,060
just appreciate those words, mouths, social media shares.

2280
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,740
They work great as well.

2281
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:18,060
We're at the end, so let me go and get final thoughts for

2282
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:18,460
the night.

2283
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,700
DarkSakra, as usual, I'll start with you because I know

2284
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:24,220
you're gonna go play on your own stream after the show

2285
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:28,700
tonight. Yeah, I'm gonna get back to trying to

2286
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,060
adapt my killers and try to remember how to play most of

2287
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:36,620
them. I actually even have it as a redeem now that you can

2288
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:37,740
force me to play nurse.

2289
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:39,500
Oh, wow.

2290
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,540
Heaven help me.

2291
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:41,020
Good luck.

2292
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:44,300
Remember, I got my adapt because they gave it to me.

2293
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:47,500
I am going to have to play her eventually, but I suck at

2294
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:51,500
nurse. I would play blight better than nurse and I suck at

2295
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:52,460
blight twins.

2296
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:57,340
Actually, I'm kind of okay at twins now, kind of sort of,

2297
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:02,700
but I did totally already adapt Pig and Freddie because

2298
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:04,460
they are my mains and I did them in one try.

2299
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:05,900
So it wasn't a big deal.

2300
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,260
But yeah, I think I might go back to the adapt thing, but

2301
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,460
if I get sick of it, who knows?

2302
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:11,580
Maybe we'll Swift.

2303
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:14,300
All right, well have a great stream and we will talk to you

2304
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,300
next week in February.

2305
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:17,900
I can't believe it's already going to be February.

2306
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:18,780
All right.

2307
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:19,180
Right.

2308
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,300
Yeah, exactly.

2309
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:22,700
Loki, we'll go to you.

2310
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:23,820
What's your final thought tonight?

2311
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,500
I'm tired.

2312
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:25,900
That's it.

2313
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:27,580
You're tired.

2314
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:28,380
You need a nap.

2315
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:28,940
I understand.

2316
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:34,620
My final thought is I haven't done personal streaming in

2317
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:36,460
a few weeks because again, as I talked about at the top of

2318
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,300
the show, I've had some personal stuff going on, especially

2319
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:39,020
this week.

2320
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:41,340
I am looking at trying to pick up some more narrative games,

2321
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,740
especially now that I've let my wow subscription lapse and

2322
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:46,540
my only MMO I'm playing now is Final Fantasy 14.

2323
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,860
I want to try to really play through some single player games.

2324
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:52,620
I definitely want to do the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters,

2325
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:56,140
Windows release on Switch, PlayStation, that whole thing.

2326
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:58,700
I might close the gap on some Pokemon games.

2327
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,660
I'm really behind on.

2328
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:02,620
I really have an itch to go back and finish Pokemon Arceus,

2329
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:05,820
which I know, like, why would I do that when I still need

2330
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,180
to beat Scarlet and Violet?

2331
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:09,100
Because I'm at the point now where I'm like, if they're

2332
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:12,300
working on a quality of life update for Scarlet and Violet,

2333
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,300
then why don't I wait for that update?

2334
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:16,700
It's this very weird day and age we live in where it's like,

2335
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,780
now I know a patch is coming, so I'm going to wait for the

2336
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:20,540
patch till I finish the game.

2337
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,460
It's weird how that goes sometimes.

2338
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:24,220
But anyway, that's it for me.

2339
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:26,540
We'll see you again in a week.

2340
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,380
Thank you so much for being here tonight, everyone.

2341
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,580
I really appreciate it.

2342
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,740
Have a wonderful week and good night.

2343
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,900
