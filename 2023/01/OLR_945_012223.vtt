WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.120
It's the Attack of the Clones!

00:11.120 --> 00:13.920
No, not the Star Wars prequel, this one was a sequel!

00:13.920 --> 00:19.920
Wortle Clone Qortle, a quad wortle, four boards at once version was purchased by Merriam Webster.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.520
This is the second wortle-like purchase and it is not known when someone will purchase

00:23.520 --> 00:25.000
duo trigortle.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.320
This intro is full of words that couldn't be played in a typical wortle or wortle-like

00:28.320 --> 00:29.320
game.

00:29.640 --> 00:45.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.160 --> 00:52.760
where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio and we're live once again episode

00:52.760 --> 00:58.620
number 945 of our show for tonight January 22nd of 2023.

00:58.620 --> 01:04.720
My name is Rob Roberts I'm joined here live on this Sunday evening as I am most often

01:04.720 --> 01:08.620
with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.620 --> 01:09.620
Sup bitches.

01:09.620 --> 01:12.180
Hi, how are you doing?

01:12.180 --> 01:20.780
I'm okay I'm tired I stayed up until five in the morning playing Dead by Daylight with

01:20.780 --> 01:21.780
people.

01:21.780 --> 01:23.780
Were you streaming the whole time?

01:23.780 --> 01:24.780
No.

01:24.780 --> 01:25.780
Oh no.

01:25.940 --> 01:31.820
Raven I did I started I'll get to it in classic game, but I did my my retro stream and then

01:31.820 --> 01:41.420
decided to go play DBD with Raven McPherson, Shayla, and Vant Bunny and and I ate whiskey

01:41.420 --> 01:44.700
filled chocolate the entire time.

01:44.700 --> 01:48.620
I was very stupid by the end of it that's the only thing I can say for myself.

01:48.620 --> 01:52.660
I I we were having giggle fits at the end.

01:52.660 --> 01:56.980
But the best games of Dead by Daylight you played this week were with me earlier this

01:56.980 --> 02:00.720
week even though I completely got you killed in one match because I thought For the People

02:00.720 --> 02:03.220
would work on a on a course.

02:03.220 --> 02:08.740
And I still am sorry about my reaction I just was so flabbergasted.

02:08.740 --> 02:13.380
I was so flabbergasted by that I'm like no don't touch me stop.

02:13.380 --> 02:17.580
Yeah and your your mic and I was saying but your mic does this noise gate thing where

02:17.580 --> 02:21.660
I think sometimes when you're like no no like it actually doesn't come through so I'm like

02:21.660 --> 02:24.860
what's going on I see the icon sometimes sometimes I don't because I think I was trying

02:24.860 --> 02:26.260
to give it to the wrong person.

02:26.260 --> 02:29.620
So anyway, it was just it was just a comedy of errors at that point.

02:29.620 --> 02:38.020
So I actually think that you might have used it on Gwen but that was just like, and I like

02:38.020 --> 02:42.860
I had to step away for a moment to get myself to chill out a little.

02:42.860 --> 02:45.540
I mean, it's fine.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.780
I mean, in retrospect, it was pretty hilarious.

02:48.140 --> 02:54.220
Um, but I'll get more into my Dead by Daylight shenanigans because I'm already gold one.

02:54.220 --> 02:54.820
All right.

02:54.820 --> 02:58.940
Well, speaking of comedy of errors also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.700
See, the mic's not muted.

03:03.260 --> 03:08.780
I keep pushing the button and it's like it's like, yes, no, yes, no, yes.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.380
I did not install the switch so you could have a microphone rave.

03:13.500 --> 03:17.180
Anyway, pretty much it will it already blinks when you when you have it on mute.

03:17.180 --> 03:23.020
So you know, I every week, of course, we tape our show live Sunday nights at the voice of

03:23.020 --> 03:28.300
geeks network twitch.tv slash v o g network Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern six

03:28.300 --> 03:31.260
o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

03:31.260 --> 03:31.740
Let's be real.

03:31.740 --> 03:36.700
We don't start till about 610 or so because we give Bob we give Bobby his space to finish

03:36.700 --> 03:37.180
the show.

03:38.060 --> 03:44.540
But if you watch us live, you get to see the visuals you get to see us things in our spaces

03:44.540 --> 03:49.100
that we do the show from and Loki oftentimes will have a game playing behind him.

03:49.100 --> 03:53.340
And tonight I noticed Loki has got is that is no B no B boy tonight, right?

03:53.340 --> 03:54.460
There's no B no B boy.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.540
Yeah, a little bit of a flashback.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.980
And now I guess that game is older than I think it is a little bit of a flashback.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.820
It's the computer when only the phone.

04:01.820 --> 04:02.320
Yeah.

04:03.100 --> 04:08.140
No B no B boy, of course, from the creator of Katamari Damacy in between the whole I'm

04:08.140 --> 04:10.540
gonna go build kids playground stuff, right.

04:10.540 --> 04:17.100
But it it the art style and the look of the game is very similar to Katamari Damacy, obviously,

04:17.100 --> 04:19.020
in that it's it's a little wild.

04:20.140 --> 04:20.640
But cute.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.060
It's Yeah, it's interesting.

04:25.020 --> 04:29.820
What a what brought no B no B boy to mind this week.

04:30.380 --> 04:33.740
You're gonna laugh because this is it's really mundane.

04:34.460 --> 04:34.960
Okay.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.940
Let's put away laundry and have a no B no B boy shirt actually have multiple no B no

04:38.940 --> 04:40.380
B boy shirts.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.340
So I just thought I was like, Oh, yeah, hey, I can do that.

04:43.340 --> 04:46.860
No, that's I think of the Golden Girls often for a similar reason.

04:46.860 --> 04:49.020
So yeah, there you go.

04:49.900 --> 04:50.400
All right.

04:51.020 --> 04:56.060
Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight and get into the stories tonight.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.620
First off, I do want to acknowledge those we are taping live tonight.

05:00.140 --> 05:03.260
What an amazing hype train going on in the chat right now.

05:03.260 --> 05:03.980
That's incredible.

05:04.620 --> 05:08.380
It just I just saw an alert that said we're about to break our record.

05:08.380 --> 05:12.540
And I think with those five gift subs Mike Def just dropped, we just might have broken

05:12.540 --> 05:14.300
our record for hype train.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.780
I don't know how long it's been tracking those trains for.

05:16.780 --> 05:17.340
But you know what?

05:17.340 --> 05:18.860
That's that's here.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.900
Maybe I don't know.

05:19.900 --> 05:20.620
But you know what?

05:21.180 --> 05:21.580
Thank you.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.540
No, seriously.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.460
That's incredibly generous of all of you.

05:25.580 --> 05:30.060
Huge motivation to be here on Sunday nights and keep doing this for all of you.

05:30.060 --> 05:34.060
Although honestly, I like hanging out with my friends, Matt and Jamie.

05:34.060 --> 05:37.500
And this has been a pretty good excuse to do that for the last 21 years.

05:38.700 --> 05:42.460
So let's get into it.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.260
What do we do here?

05:43.260 --> 05:46.380
We talk about what's going on in the gaming world and gaming news and all of that.

05:46.380 --> 05:52.060
So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which I wish we had better news tonight.

05:52.060 --> 05:58.220
Unfortunately, this is just probably a symptom of what's going on in the world period, right?

05:58.220 --> 06:02.140
So let me start with actually Dark Sakura tonight with our kickoff topic tonight on

06:02.140 --> 06:03.260
what's going on in the industry.

06:04.300 --> 06:05.740
Shenanigans and bullshit.

06:06.540 --> 06:10.540
Um, it's it's it's consumerism.

06:10.540 --> 06:13.340
It's it's capitalism at work.

06:14.220 --> 06:22.060
So the the tech industry is experiencing a crap load of layoffs.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.580
They are at Microsoft.

06:25.580 --> 06:34.060
They're announcing they announced Wednesday plans to cut 10,000 jobs, including 343 Industries,

06:34.060 --> 06:40.140
the coalition, and Bethesda, League of Legends.

06:41.900 --> 06:46.140
Sorry, Riot Games, who does League of Legends, has cut more than 40 jobs.

06:49.180 --> 06:54.780
Microsoft, I mean, now keep in mind that Microsoft's layoffs are less than 5% of its

06:54.780 --> 06:55.660
total workforce.

06:56.620 --> 07:03.020
But still, I mean, this is this is pretty, that's a lot of people who are going to be

07:03.020 --> 07:03.500
out of work.

07:05.820 --> 07:11.980
And then Google is cutting 12,000 jobs.

07:13.660 --> 07:21.340
Their CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that they were hired for a different economic reality

07:21.340 --> 07:23.580
than the one we face today, end quote.

07:23.580 --> 07:26.540
And of course, this is coming right after the shutdown of Stadia.

07:27.180 --> 07:27.500
Fuck.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.940
Anyway, RIP Stadia.

07:31.900 --> 07:37.020
Unity is eliminating 284 jobs.

07:37.980 --> 07:42.300
They're closing a sports and live entertainment department to end a project that would let

07:42.300 --> 07:44.860
viewers watch sports matches from different angles.

07:48.700 --> 07:53.020
There's Riot Games is laying off 46 people.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.980
It's there.

07:55.980 --> 07:59.900
The analysts are saying there's going to be even more that they're trying to preserve

07:59.900 --> 08:03.820
their profitability in the face of an oncoming recession.

08:03.820 --> 08:13.900
But I mean, would it make sense to remove people's sources of income that they could

08:13.900 --> 08:15.980
be putting back into the economy?

08:18.060 --> 08:22.060
Well, we can't pay these employees if we want our Sting concerts, you know, it's either

08:22.060 --> 08:24.460
Sting or employees and I just like Sting better.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.580
No, they want to the CEO.

08:27.580 --> 08:32.540
I want to see the CEOs take their pay cut to retain employees.

08:32.540 --> 08:33.580
That's what I want to see.

08:33.580 --> 08:38.380
Do you remember when the Wii U had its flop era, which was pretty much the whole time

08:38.380 --> 08:39.180
it was released?

08:39.180 --> 08:39.740
Sorry.

08:39.740 --> 08:43.100
I know some of the games are great, but let's be real, the Wii U for all intents and purposes

08:43.100 --> 08:43.900
was a flop.

08:43.900 --> 08:50.060
Do you remember when Miyamoto took personal responsibility and said, I am cutting my salary

08:50.060 --> 08:50.540
this year?

08:50.540 --> 08:52.220
Miyamoto, that was Iwata.

08:52.220 --> 08:52.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.580
Sorry, horrible mistake to make.

08:55.580 --> 09:01.740
But it was Iwata that, yes, said I'm going to cut my salary on this whole thing because

09:01.740 --> 09:03.820
of the poor performance of the Wii U, right?

09:04.460 --> 09:05.820
And that's why-

09:05.820 --> 09:07.900
That was an amazing news.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.260
That's why he's respected.

09:11.340 --> 09:12.540
Even Emeritus.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.220
Anyhow, sorry, I just wanted to add that.

09:16.220 --> 09:26.540
It's absolutely disgusting that people are more worried about their own pockets than

09:26.540 --> 09:32.460
the longevity of their company and the well-being of their employees, that they could just let

09:32.460 --> 09:33.420
them go like that.

09:33.420 --> 09:35.020
It's absolutely disgusting.

09:37.020 --> 09:45.660
Yeah, it's really telling that the senior level executives don't bear the brunt in a

09:45.660 --> 09:49.420
similar proportion when these sorts of things happen.

09:49.420 --> 09:55.420
That's the real kind of disgusting and what ought to be frankly illegal part of this.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.260
But what do I know?

09:58.220 --> 09:59.100
But yeah.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.020
But I guess let me ask this question too.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.540
Well, actually, let me go to Loki and see if there's anything you wanted to add on this,

10:04.540 --> 10:06.540
because I know you've been following the story too, Loki.

10:07.260 --> 10:12.620
Well, I remember seeing some stuff where they were cutting departments dedicated to, what

10:12.620 --> 10:17.260
was it, the mixed reality stuff and HoloLens.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.620
So I guess that's a development we're not going to see for a while.

10:20.620 --> 10:28.380
And then just different game teams as well, like 343 Industries, which is understandable

10:28.380 --> 10:31.740
because Halo Infinite was kind of rocky.

10:31.740 --> 10:35.100
Well, but then there were those weird rumors about they're not going to do Halo anymore

10:35.100 --> 10:37.900
to which they actually came out on their actual Twitter and said,

10:37.900 --> 10:40.940
we look forward to doing Halo for a long time.

10:40.940 --> 10:46.940
That doesn't mean they won't partner with others or that sort of they can oversee Halo

10:46.940 --> 10:48.460
without doing it themselves.

10:48.460 --> 10:54.940
But any way you slice it, unfortunately, a lot of people that worked on Halo Infinite

10:54.940 --> 10:57.500
are not employed as of this week, which stinks.

10:58.460 --> 11:03.420
Yeah, I don't know if it's because they're trying to grow too fast or something like

11:03.420 --> 11:08.140
that, because, I mean, Microsoft has been doing a lot of acquisitions of different companies.

11:08.140 --> 11:09.900
I'm sure Google does the same stuff.

11:12.140 --> 11:12.700
I don't know.

11:13.740 --> 11:17.180
I don't understand how CEOs operate.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.500
Some comments from chat.

11:19.500 --> 11:23.100
Sjo and Hunter Matt says these companies knew they were going to do this months ago, but

11:23.100 --> 11:25.500
they waited until after the holidays to do it.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.020
Like that is supposed to hurt any less.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.180
I mean, at least it was something.

11:31.740 --> 11:32.780
Yeah, it could be worse.

11:32.780 --> 11:36.300
They could do what the guy at Twitter did and do it two weeks before the holidays.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.460
But anyway, whatever.

11:38.460 --> 11:42.060
It's not these people who got laid off fault that these companies grew too quickly and

11:42.060 --> 11:45.500
they didn't forecast or support the people that they rushed to hire.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.420
That is a theme that you see a lot throughout the industry.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.980
But again, whose fault is that at the end of the day?

11:52.940 --> 11:54.300
It's typically leadership.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.260
It's leadership, for sure.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.060
This is a bummer.

11:59.580 --> 12:00.860
So what happens now?

12:01.580 --> 12:07.660
Luckily, one nice thing about the gaming industry is that I've noticed that the game developers

12:07.660 --> 12:09.740
and so forth, they really look out for each other.

12:09.740 --> 12:13.900
That's why also, your reputation is very important.

12:13.900 --> 12:19.180
This is also why you never see game developers talking shit about each other on Twitter or

12:19.180 --> 12:20.300
any type of social media.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.540
You sure do see the players talking shit about them.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.740
And that's why a lot of players don't end up getting into the industry.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.180
All tea, all shade.

12:29.260 --> 12:36.140
Is that because when you build out that reputation for yourself or a lot of journalists and podcasters

12:36.140 --> 12:39.020
and yes, I completely am self attacking.

12:40.460 --> 12:45.820
A lot of reasons people like us don't get into the industry is because our reputation

12:46.860 --> 12:51.180
ends up getting ruined because of the stuff we say on social media and things like that.

12:51.180 --> 12:54.220
This is a very small industry and bridges can burn quickly.

12:54.220 --> 12:57.820
That being said, though, I don't want to focus on the negative because for the most part,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.020
people know how to act.

12:59.580 --> 13:03.580
And a lot of the gaming industry really does look out for each other.

13:03.580 --> 13:09.900
And I think oftentimes when we see large gaming studio gets too large and gets bought, then

13:09.900 --> 13:15.180
a spin off studio ends up opening up inevitably, and we'll start to hire and so forth.

13:15.740 --> 13:19.500
So at least the gaming industry is really good about looking out for its people.

13:20.220 --> 13:25.100
It's just very disruptive, obviously, because sometimes that means it's going to be relocation.

13:25.180 --> 13:31.100
Although, you know, in the in this, you know, pandemic, I don't want to say post pandemics

13:31.100 --> 13:31.980
pandemic is not over.

13:31.980 --> 13:38.140
But it's in this people feel over it pandemic world that we're in now, you know, more people

13:38.140 --> 13:38.780
work from home.

13:38.780 --> 13:41.820
So do you need to necessarily be relocating?

13:41.820 --> 13:42.220
I don't know.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.980
I guess that depends on the company you're signing up for.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.020
I'm gonna say something about management in general.

13:47.020 --> 13:47.420
Yeah.

13:47.420 --> 13:53.100
That no matter where the management starts off in the company, eventually they forget.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.260
They become corporate.

13:58.140 --> 14:01.500
And it's it's just something that happens.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.860
I have seen it happen to the nicest people.

14:05.420 --> 14:10.620
It changes who they are, because then the only thing that they are looking at is base

14:11.340 --> 14:14.700
numbers, big picture, high level things.

14:14.700 --> 14:20.780
And forgetting what really makes the company work is what reality is like.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.980
I'm looking at some other comments in chat.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.540
DJ Rama S says a lot of them got severance pay.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.380
It's something at least to be fair, Rama.

14:28.380 --> 14:29.500
Yes, I don't disagree.

14:29.500 --> 14:35.020
But a lot of that's mandated retired, required to Yeah, a lot of that is mandated because

14:35.020 --> 14:39.260
like, for example, I think in Europe, I may be wrong.

14:39.260 --> 14:41.500
And if I'm talking out of my ass, I apologize.

14:41.500 --> 14:47.100
I believe in Europe, it's you have to give 90 days notice that you're going to terminate

14:47.100 --> 14:50.460
somebody's position for a company of a certain size.

14:50.460 --> 14:55.260
The way companies get around that they pay 90 days of severance, because that way they're

14:55.260 --> 14:58.300
basically able to say, Oh, we're laying you off today.

14:58.860 --> 15:00.700
But it's effective as this this date.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.820
And that's what you're getting paid for.

15:01.820 --> 15:05.100
So severance is how they kind of get around some of those laws sometimes.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.660
I realize some companies go above and beyond.

15:07.660 --> 15:08.620
And that is awesome.

15:08.620 --> 15:12.460
But I, I don't want to give the executives too much credit.

15:12.460 --> 15:13.340
It's where I'm going.

15:13.340 --> 15:18.460
No, I know I hear legally severance begins after the last date worked.

15:19.100 --> 15:23.820
So, um, so something like that wouldn't fly.

15:23.820 --> 15:28.060
It's like when you are no longer considered an employee of the company.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.460
That's when you start getting your severance payout.

15:30.460 --> 15:30.960
Yeah.

15:31.660 --> 15:35.020
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they've gotten really good at looking after each other talking

15:35.020 --> 15:37.660
about the folks in the industry, because this happens so often.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.860
They have lots of practice.

15:38.860 --> 15:42.620
We have a saying at my company that the best way to ruin a great developer is to make the

15:42.620 --> 15:43.120
management.

15:43.120 --> 15:48.880
Questbuster says corporations take advantage of feast or famine cycles with ruthless abandon.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.880
Expect them to gorge when things are on fire and watch them amputate what they don't need

15:52.880 --> 15:53.920
to stop the bleeding.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.880
But the weird the weird thing I mean, I don't disagree with what you're saying Questbuster,

15:56.880 --> 16:01.920
but the weird thought that it leads me to is that here, I swear we were just sitting

16:01.920 --> 16:02.880
here two weeks ago.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.560
I mean, I can't believe we're at the end of January.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.880
But I, I feel like we were just sitting here doing our predictions two weeks ago.

16:09.040 --> 16:14.480
And we were looking at, wow, what a big wow, my my my my inner Jennifer Coolidge just came

16:14.480 --> 16:14.980
out.

16:14.980 --> 16:15.480
Wow.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.920
2023 is going to be a year for the games.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.680
But I mean, really, it's it's there's so many big things coming out this year, right?

16:23.680 --> 16:25.920
There's there's Zelda, right?

16:25.920 --> 16:28.320
There's Final Fantasy 16.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.280
There's a PSVR two, if that's what you're into.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.480
There's potentially maybe a switch rebrand or something.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.880
And you never know what else the switch is going to be into.

16:36.880 --> 16:42.080
Like, when we're looking at what is slated to come out this year, and yes, I understand.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.480
Things get pushed back on the calendar all the time.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.120
Yes, yes, yes.

16:45.120 --> 16:50.320
But overall, looking at 2023 as a year, it looks like it's going to be a big fucking

16:50.320 --> 16:50.820
year.

16:50.820 --> 16:56.960
Now, I because I already know some of you are thinking it perhaps, okay, those games

16:56.960 --> 16:58.320
are all about to go gold.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.320
So we're going to lay off this test team.

17:00.320 --> 17:05.440
But I also feel like so many of those games like, I'm sorry, Final Fantasy 16, that's

17:05.440 --> 17:11.280
Final Fantasy 16, not having DLC, especially looking after at looking at 15.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.160
Yeah, right.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.840
Zelda not having deals.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.120
Like I feel like games are playing the long game.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.200
At this point, you need teams to be around a while.

17:19.200 --> 17:24.000
So it's just but then again, Square and Nintendo, the games I keep referencing are not two of

17:24.000 --> 17:27.520
the companies that we're talking about right now in regards to layoffs.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.760
So I mean, maybe I'm just applying the wrong things to the situation.

17:31.760 --> 17:38.960
But I still feel like it's a decent year ahead for Microsoft and Game Pass and all

17:38.960 --> 17:39.440
of that.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.120
It's just a little weird to me.

17:41.120 --> 17:41.620
I don't know.

17:43.520 --> 17:43.840
Let's see.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.360
Looking in chat at some other comments.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.320
Darted Studio says hell yeah, Zelda clearing off my calendar for that one.

17:51.040 --> 17:51.600
Let's see.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.800
Zen Monkey 11 says that was a great Jennifer Coolidge impression.

17:55.520 --> 17:55.920
Thank you.

17:55.920 --> 17:56.800
You know what?

17:56.800 --> 17:57.300
What?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.760
I was thinking Charlie the Unicorn.

18:00.320 --> 18:05.680
Oh, Candy Mountain, Charlie.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.720
These gays.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.920
They're trying to murder me.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.320
Now I want to see her.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.240
It's a magical Leopleradon.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.680
Now I want to see her as a Twitch streaming playing games.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.240
Actually, Zen Monkey 11 on a completely unrelated note.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.600
I love Jennifer Coolidge.

18:19.600 --> 18:26.400
And I look anybody like I think any person I was about to say any gay person, any person

18:26.400 --> 18:30.880
period with taste is happy to see all the love that she's getting.

18:30.880 --> 18:35.200
Thanks to things like White Lotus and things that should have been happening when she was

18:35.200 --> 18:37.120
Stifler's mom like a long time ago.

18:37.120 --> 18:37.440
Right.

18:37.440 --> 18:42.720
And legally blonde and all that when she was playing all the hairdress rules.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.400
My point with Jennifer Coolidge.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.920
She just started a TikTok.

18:46.640 --> 18:51.440
So she's inching closer to the streaming thing, but she has an official TikTok now.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.240
So anyway, let's see.

18:54.240 --> 18:59.680
Evil Protagonist says, hopefully Google started with the team that made Stadia.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.280
Here's the thing, Evil Protagonist.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.760
It's not the fault of many others.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.560
Actually, those people made a good product.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.060
They did.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.360
It's Phil Harris.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.000
Phil Harrison's the one that needs to get laid off because his messaging sucked, you

19:14.000 --> 19:17.760
know, and, you know, I just I don't know.

19:17.760 --> 19:23.040
Like I don't want to take it out on the teams who oftentimes were just doing what they were

19:23.040 --> 19:26.160
told and oftentimes actually have a really good idea.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.400
And it's just poorly fucking supported in marketing.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.400
Food for thought.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.240
Let's see.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.800
Other comments in chat.

19:35.440 --> 19:41.280
Bobby Blackwolf says, but I'm glad that everyone is going to be celebrating the anniversary

19:41.280 --> 19:42.800
of my 29th birthday this year.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.040
I mean, they'll say they're crying for a kingdom.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.840
This is a play on the Zelda game, but I know it's really for my anniversary.

19:50.560 --> 19:55.120
SSJ100Matt says, speaking of White Lotus, I got to see Aubrey Plaza's SNL performance

19:55.120 --> 19:55.600
last night.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.800
I heard it was good.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.080
I don't know if Shad Leland's still in chat, but he could tell you all about it and we're

20:00.080 --> 20:01.120
derailing, but I don't care.

20:02.400 --> 20:07.040
So you could watch like all of Saturday Night Live before it even airs on the West Coast

20:07.040 --> 20:08.960
because they put it all on YouTube.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.520
So before it even aired here, I was looking up the Megan 2.0 sketch they did last night

20:14.080 --> 20:15.680
and that was really funny.

20:15.680 --> 20:20.800
Like, it could have been funnier, but some of the jokes that they did, like, they were

20:20.800 --> 20:22.880
they she didn't yet.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.760
Don't spoil it.

20:23.760 --> 20:29.920
Okay, no, I bet they say stop singing this song and play something, play something the

20:29.920 --> 20:31.280
gays can get into or something like that.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.680
And they start playing the theme from White Lotus.

20:33.680 --> 20:38.560
That was the part that made me laugh the loudest because the theme from White Lotus is so,

20:38.560 --> 20:40.800
like, specific.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.200
It's like a very specific kind of meme.

20:44.240 --> 20:49.760
So and just playing that it's like this is a song the gays get into is absolutely true.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.720
So I just thought that was a very smart joke.

20:52.720 --> 20:57.040
Anyway, Tiger Claw says they already announced a sequel to Megan.

20:57.040 --> 20:57.920
Yes, they did.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.040
They absolutely did.

21:00.720 --> 21:04.320
Speaking, let's derail the train further because I've got to give a shout out to this.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.600
So Megan drag acts are all the rage right now.

21:08.560 --> 21:15.840
One of my friends is a drag performer and they did a Megan drag act last night, but

21:15.840 --> 21:20.080
they I got to play a victim in their act.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.080
And so, yeah, I got to have my ear removed as part of the act.

21:24.080 --> 21:24.960
So there was there was fake.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.920
My ear was like covered in fake blood when it was all done and all this stuff.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.480
It was.

21:28.480 --> 21:32.000
So I was like, and we were even joking as they were telling me before the show, they

21:32.000 --> 21:34.880
were like, Megan acts.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.560
There's so many on YouTube right now.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.720
And I said, red, red, because drag queen is red for filth, which if look up red for

21:40.720 --> 21:42.000
filth, they're great name.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.960
Yeah, red.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.600
I told her I said, Red, you're the only one that's going to have an act with a real

21:47.600 --> 21:48.640
live victim.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.000
And they were like, Oh, good point.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.360
So I said, you're up in the ante with your act.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.520
So but it was a lot of fun.

21:55.520 --> 22:00.160
And yes, since I wasn't hosting the show last night, because, you know, I got to share

22:00.160 --> 22:02.560
sometimes there's lots of talented hosts in the area.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.080
I got to participate in the act.

22:04.080 --> 22:09.120
So anyway, just wanted to shout that out there randomly as we're talking about layoffs.

22:09.120 --> 22:09.520
Sorry.

22:11.040 --> 22:15.440
Sorry for the bad news about layoffs, but we could talk about drag queens can always

22:15.440 --> 22:16.160
make you feel better.

22:16.160 --> 22:16.660
Right.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.020
All right.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.400
Let's see other comments in chat.

22:22.400 --> 22:22.640
Yeah.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.320
As Joan Hunter Matt says, can't derail if the train was never on the rails to begin

22:26.320 --> 22:26.640
with.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, that's that's very true.

22:28.000 --> 22:28.400
Train.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.120
That's very true.

22:30.080 --> 22:30.480
All right.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.040
We just have a boat that's kind of trying not to capsize.

22:36.240 --> 22:40.560
Well, in all seriousness, you know, if you were somebody that was affected by the layoffs,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.480
I'm very sorry to hear it.

22:42.480 --> 22:47.280
And, you know, refer back to what I said earlier, the industry is very good at taking care of

22:47.280 --> 22:47.760
its own.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.120
So, you know, don't be afraid to ask for help.

22:51.120 --> 22:56.000
If you are a social media user, you know, I'm not usually one to sit here to talk good

22:56.000 --> 22:56.640
about Twitter.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.600
But I completely understand people are there.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.280
Doing a shout out on a platform like that might help you find something.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.320
I personally have had a lot of luck over the years of LinkedIn.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.280
I'm not in the gaming industry.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.480
I'm in a different industry, but LinkedIn has been great for networking, connecting,

23:10.480 --> 23:11.440
and finding positions.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.840
And, heck, Mastodon, a lot of people have been moving over there.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.120
A lot of good stuff there, too.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.040
And plenty more.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.240
So, you know, use that social networking.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.240
Yeah, use that social networking.

23:24.880 --> 23:29.680
And just don't be afraid to say, hey, this news sucks.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.640
Can anyone help me?

23:30.640 --> 23:33.680
Because you never know who is out there that might have a good lead for you.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.680
So, all right.

23:36.400 --> 23:41.040
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing

23:41.040 --> 23:41.680
this week.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.200
So, Dark Soccer, I know we got into it a little bit ago, but would you like to tell us more

23:45.200 --> 23:46.000
about your gaming week?

23:47.920 --> 23:53.120
I, of course, have been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight because it's my jam.

23:54.080 --> 24:01.920
And, of course, I finished Final Fantasy V, and so I started Star Ocean last night.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.760
And mind you, I have never played any of the Star Ocean games.

24:05.760 --> 24:09.120
I knew I would be starting it from scratch pretty much.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.600
And so far, oh, my God, why did this game not come out over here?

24:13.600 --> 24:14.400
It's beautiful.

24:15.600 --> 24:22.480
Like, it's the type of pretty level that Sake and Densetsu 2 and 3 were.

24:23.360 --> 24:30.000
You know, just really well animated, and it has digitized voice acting.

24:31.920 --> 24:36.240
Like, the whole beginning of the game is voice acted.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.840
It's so good.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.240
And the music is so good.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.600
Super Metroid did it first.

24:42.640 --> 24:47.600
Super Metroid had hardly any spoken text in comparison to this game.

24:47.600 --> 24:51.120
The last Metroid was in captivity.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.280
Which is the limit of the voice in that.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.560
This has, like, whole bridge conversations.

24:57.760 --> 25:03.200
Tell me, though, that you were floored as a young adult hearing that Super Metroid

25:03.200 --> 25:04.400
voiceover for the first time.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.640
Like, it's talking.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.360
It's talking.

25:07.360 --> 25:07.920
Anyway, yes.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.840
Well, I'm also going to say Kirby's Avalanche.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.400
Which said even less, Kirby's Avalanche.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.320
And all the characters said things like, yeah, ta.

25:21.760 --> 25:22.960
And how could I forget?

25:22.960 --> 25:23.760
Pikachu!

25:24.480 --> 25:25.360
Pikachu!

25:28.000 --> 25:28.800
At any rate.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.880
But I'm absolutely in love with it.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.160
It's such a good game.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.920
It's such a good game so far.

25:40.320 --> 25:45.280
It's like sci-fi fantasy JRPG gold.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.560
Platinum, even.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.520
I really enjoy it.

25:48.480 --> 25:54.240
So also, of course, I've been playing Marvel's Midnight Suns.

25:54.240 --> 25:58.080
I freaking love, love, love, love, love that game.

25:58.080 --> 25:58.800
It's so good.

26:01.440 --> 26:05.200
And what else is I playing?

26:06.480 --> 26:10.080
I might be playing a little bit of Cult of the Lambs soon just because I kind of miss

26:10.080 --> 26:12.640
running around and I love the music in that game.

26:12.640 --> 26:19.120
And I need to make sure that my cultists don't forget who to worship.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.280
But yeah, that's been the thing.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.880
And I know what I like.

26:30.560 --> 26:30.880
All right.

26:31.600 --> 26:35.440
Well, speaking of players that I think know the games that they like,

26:35.440 --> 26:36.720
Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.840
Well, it's all Minecraft.

26:40.800 --> 26:53.040
It was just working on designing terraforming for an area that I started a few episodes ago.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.600
So with like the creeper man stuff.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.360
And so now I finished the terraforming.

26:57.360 --> 27:01.600
But it took forever to design it because I did a bunch of custom trees.

27:01.600 --> 27:06.880
And so those take time, especially since I'm not copying and pasting them.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.640
I made like 30 plus trees.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.120
I don't know.

27:11.120 --> 27:11.680
They're big.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.040
So yeah, it's been that.

27:15.040 --> 27:21.280
And then today I've been trying to get I was trying to design stuff for my modded single

27:21.280 --> 27:24.000
player or well, I say single player.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.800
That was a slip.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.800
No, it's multiplayer, but no one plays on the server anymore.

27:29.680 --> 27:34.640
So it my multiplayer series or modded series.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.520
But you know me, I can't stop adding mods to it.

27:37.520 --> 27:43.600
And so I got we finally hit that point where maybe there's too much too many mods added

27:43.600 --> 27:46.320
to the game is having stability problems.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.440
So I'm trying to balance that a little bit.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.000
I think I had one mod that was conflicting with another one.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.640
And I think I found replacements for it.

27:54.640 --> 28:00.240
But then I'm also adding something or want to add something that adds buildable airships.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.720
That might be too much with all the physical, the physics calculations.

28:04.720 --> 28:13.120
I know my frame rate was starting to get a bit low with I like having the shaders on.

28:13.120 --> 28:18.720
The shaders look so good, but yeah, it cuts the frame rate in half, especially when you

28:18.720 --> 28:22.800
have like, you know, mods that are doing physics calculations on a bunch of different blocks

28:22.800 --> 28:23.360
and stuff.

28:23.360 --> 28:29.680
It's it's not we may have to turn the shaders off eventually, and that's so hard for me.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.440
No, but I'm playing around with it right now.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.480
So yeah, I'm working on that.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.960
And then hopefully going to I think I may work on the actual building because I designed

28:40.960 --> 28:44.640
everything on our creative server because we have a creative server that we can just

28:44.640 --> 28:45.680
fly around and do whatever.

28:45.680 --> 28:51.520
And then we just copy stuff to a schematic and then bring it over to the survival server,

28:52.400 --> 28:54.720
which then I have to build it all by hand again.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.160
So I have to do that now.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.240
I've been collecting resources for that.

28:58.240 --> 29:02.240
And they had a lot of leaves, so that took a few days.

29:02.240 --> 29:08.400
And then last year, yesterday, I was just mining the ton.

29:08.400 --> 29:14.240
So I ended up filling up a lot of my storage room with supplies for future projects and

29:14.240 --> 29:14.740
stuff.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.880
So yeah, it looks really, really good, though.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.640
It looks really good because I have these trees that are kind of like they look like

29:22.640 --> 29:25.200
big redwood trees almost.

29:25.360 --> 29:30.320
I guess they're big spruce trees, but they're also because if you play Mega Man or anything

29:30.320 --> 29:34.640
like that, or at least seen screenshots of it, you know, like in all the backgrounds

29:34.640 --> 29:39.520
and stuff that kind of like nature things, but it's also like artificial nature things.

29:39.520 --> 29:44.400
So you see like kind of panels ripped off the trees where you have metal exposed and

29:44.400 --> 29:45.120
stuff like that.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.640
So I'm building stuff like that.

29:46.640 --> 29:47.920
It looks really cool.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.680
So I really like the way it came out.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.840
So it'll be hopefully pretty soon.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.520
We'll have an episode out for that.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.560
Okay, cool.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.040
Let's see my gaming week.

29:59.040 --> 30:02.080
So honestly, it's a lot of the stuff I talk about often.

30:02.880 --> 30:08.880
Final Fantasy XIV, my island sanctuary is now rank 11, which means I have access to

30:08.880 --> 30:13.520
the new seeds they added in the recent patch, which I believe is paprika and leeks.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.440
So I'm now growing leeks in my garden.

30:15.440 --> 30:20.480
I'm growing a ton of both of those to kind of get caught up, but I should be ranked 12

30:20.480 --> 30:21.120
next week.

30:21.120 --> 30:26.240
And that means I get access to the new alligator mount and the ever important speedo cosplay

30:26.880 --> 30:27.840
for my character.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.960
Very important to get that.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.920
Dyable, by the way.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.320
So any color that you possibly imagine.

30:32.320 --> 30:36.160
And because glamour, of course, is the end game, true end game of Final Fantasy.

30:36.160 --> 30:40.240
So working on that, still playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, but I actually canceled

30:40.240 --> 30:43.840
my account because I'm like, okay, I think I've done everything I'm going to do in my

30:43.840 --> 30:44.640
little revisiting.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.760
If I suddenly start picking up and doing more mythic dungeons in the next week or something

30:49.760 --> 30:53.440
to keep me engaged, then maybe I'll suck her up and buy another month.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.040
But otherwise I was like, you know what?

30:55.040 --> 30:59.280
I'm going to just cancel it just so I don't accidentally auto renew.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.400
So we'll see how that goes.

31:01.440 --> 31:05.840
Still been playing like cell phone games, you know, between Ingress and Pokemon Go.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.280
There was a classic event for Larvitar Community Day yesterday.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.640
So I did that for a little bit.

31:11.600 --> 31:16.000
Pikmin also, I walked 12,000 steps yesterday because Pikmin had a community day to walk

31:16.000 --> 31:16.800
10,000 steps.

31:16.800 --> 31:21.520
So walked a lot, a lot yesterday, but it was good as daffodil day.

31:21.520 --> 31:25.280
So growing lots of daffodils was the plant they introduced in that game recently.

31:27.040 --> 31:32.080
Also, if you follow the Niantic products, word on the street is, I don't know if this

31:32.080 --> 31:36.960
will actually happen or not, but word on the street is that NBA All World is going to launch

31:36.960 --> 31:39.760
on Tuesday in all regions.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.600
So it's being tested.

31:43.600 --> 31:49.840
It's being tested right now in like France and Canada and like other other regions, very

31:49.840 --> 31:51.440
limited select areas.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.800
Yeah, I'm curious.

31:52.800 --> 31:58.880
Like, look, I may not be a sports person, but number one, sports, when sports video

31:58.880 --> 32:01.520
games are done well, I'll eat it up.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.440
And case in point, if you want to talk NBA, how about NBA Jam?

32:05.440 --> 32:08.000
Probably one of the greatest fucking sports games of all time.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.120
Even people like me who are like, I don't really play sports games.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.120
It's like, oh, but NBA Jam is really cool.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.960
So what is the game?

32:16.960 --> 32:18.080
Like, what is the game?

32:18.800 --> 32:20.560
I actually get players.

32:21.760 --> 32:25.360
I've been trying to follow the campfire community with the screenshot system.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.320
I don't know.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.040
I can't tell because all the screenshots are in French.

32:29.760 --> 32:37.120
So I think it looks like you kind of pick up players, you recruit players for a team,

32:37.120 --> 32:39.760
and then you like maybe control courts.

32:39.920 --> 32:44.560
You do like, because I've heard of things like three point shootouts and one on one

32:44.560 --> 32:45.760
games that you play on the court.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.120
But again, don't quote me on any of this because honestly, I don't fucking know.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.360
And until I play the game for myself, I don't know.

32:51.360 --> 32:57.040
I'll try it because I have fucking played every Niantic game and pretty much any AR

32:57.040 --> 32:58.960
game that has come out, I will try it.

32:59.600 --> 33:04.880
And I'll let you all know if it's worth crossing over if you don't usually play sports

33:04.880 --> 33:05.280
games.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.000
But I'm certainly curious.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.240
So I hope they make the release this week.

33:10.240 --> 33:15.680
I mean, don't hold them to it because that release date was in their campfire community

33:15.680 --> 33:17.280
like before the end of the year.

33:17.280 --> 33:20.640
They said they're going to launch globally on January 24th, which is Tuesday.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.160
So we'll see if they do it or not.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.120
So we'll see.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.840
Philan9 says Rob is broing out right now.

33:27.840 --> 33:33.760
I guess I didn't realize that I was actually talking to a friend about the NBA, another

33:33.760 --> 33:36.720
friend that also plays Ingress and Pokemon is into all the games I am.

33:37.360 --> 33:43.360
And I was like, if we get to be our own teams, I don't want to be the Kings.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.320
Absolutely not.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.800
Because living in Sacramento, everybody's going to be the Kings, or they're going to

33:48.800 --> 33:53.360
be the Lakers because we have a lot of Laker fans here who love to, you know, but apparently

33:53.360 --> 33:56.480
I didn't realize the Kings apparently are actually doing very well right now.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.040
Relatively.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.800
They're like third in the league right now.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.840
I was like, what?

33:59.840 --> 34:01.120
When did the Kings get a good team?

34:01.120 --> 34:02.000
That's okay.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.760
Weird timeline we're in now.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.600
I know what's going on.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.640
So I'm like, who's the last place team?

34:08.640 --> 34:09.920
That's the team I'm going to pick.

34:09.920 --> 34:14.960
So it looks like unless otherwise convinced I'll be the Detroit Pistons.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.720
It sounds like so.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.320
But I don't know yet.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.760
Because honest to God, I was like, well, I'll do a city I like.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.720
I said, I can be the Seattle SuperSonics, right?

34:24.720 --> 34:30.720
And somebody straight had to sit me down and go, Rob, Seattle hasn't had a team since 2008.

34:32.640 --> 34:34.000
This is your reality.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.920
Oh, I'm like, wait, what?

34:37.360 --> 34:40.320
Actually, Seattle tried to steal the Sacramento Kings.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.360
I don't know if you're aware.

34:42.160 --> 34:42.660
What?

34:43.280 --> 34:44.160
Lots of people have.

34:45.280 --> 34:45.780
So.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.960
Anyway, I thought they were going to be the Vegas Kings for a while there.

34:50.160 --> 34:54.000
Well, Vegas got their got our our football team instead.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.960
But is that a blessing or a curse?

34:59.360 --> 35:00.560
It depends who you ask.

35:01.280 --> 35:01.780
All right.

35:01.780 --> 35:08.500
Let's see, Mike Deaf says, I'm still waiting for him to get to level 50 in Pogo.

35:08.500 --> 35:12.500
And SJ 100 Matt says, Rob's got to get his max level on every Niantic product.

35:12.500 --> 35:17.860
Well, to be fair, you know who she who shall not be named made me stop playing that Harry

35:17.860 --> 35:19.780
Potter wizards unite before they shut it down.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.140
So I never did get max level on that.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.500
I got to 30.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.140
But that was about as far as I could get before I was like, I.

35:26.500 --> 35:27.000
I can't.

35:27.940 --> 35:28.660
It was that simple.

35:29.620 --> 35:32.340
But I've I've been max level in Ingress.

35:32.340 --> 35:34.660
I'll probably get max level in Pikmin eventually.

35:34.660 --> 35:35.700
It's just walking.

35:35.700 --> 35:36.200
I'll get there.

35:37.940 --> 35:42.100
Pokemon is the tough thing is those level up gates.

35:42.100 --> 35:48.980
I'm just too unmotivated to fight 50 Team Rocket leaders because you have to do things

35:48.980 --> 35:52.180
that are very hard to multitask in those games.

35:52.180 --> 35:58.020
Meaning I can't play like Ingress and Pikmin and because I've got to sit there and go,

35:58.020 --> 36:01.700
here's a Team Rocket, stop, fight, fight, fight, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.140
Okay, here's the leader.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.380
Stop, spit, tap, tap, tap, bite, bite, bite.

36:05.380 --> 36:08.660
It's like I can't be bothered to do the level up quest.

36:08.660 --> 36:09.380
That's my problem.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.380
I'll get there eventually.

36:11.380 --> 36:11.540
All right.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.220
One other game I played this week and then I'll be done.

36:13.220 --> 36:16.740
I promise the other game I played this week blast from the past.

36:17.300 --> 36:22.500
Ikaruga I played because apparently it is free.

36:22.500 --> 36:26.820
I don't know if it's still free right this moment, but in this morning it was free on

36:26.820 --> 36:32.500
the Xbox Argentina store and specifically you have to be in the Argentina marketplace.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.460
I don't know why.

36:33.460 --> 36:35.780
I don't know if it's some sort of holiday or something.

36:36.740 --> 36:37.300
Pardon me.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.860
What is unique about Xbox Argentina?

36:39.860 --> 36:44.340
But you can get it free in that store right now, or at least maybe somebody in chat will

36:44.340 --> 36:45.380
fact check me live here.

36:45.380 --> 36:47.860
I put the link on my Mastodon if somebody wants to check if it's still there.

36:48.900 --> 36:52.260
But it was free.

36:52.260 --> 36:53.380
It's not free on the US store.

36:53.380 --> 36:56.500
It's like $3.29 or some price still right now.

36:57.780 --> 37:02.340
But yeah, I grabbed that and I checked it out because even though it was an Xbox 360,

37:02.340 --> 37:08.660
which obviously was a re-release of something for the Dreamcast, you can play it on series

37:08.660 --> 37:11.540
SNX because it's one of the backwards compatible titles.

37:11.540 --> 37:13.060
So looks great.

37:14.340 --> 37:14.660
All right.

37:15.620 --> 37:20.180
Mike Def says it's normally free there for some reason, like every month it goes free

37:20.180 --> 37:21.620
on Xbox Argentina.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.500
Interesting.

37:22.500 --> 37:26.660
Well, today was the day that it caught my attention and I went and I was like, oh, sure

37:26.660 --> 37:27.220
enough.

37:27.220 --> 37:30.180
Even though I have a US account, I can click on that, redeem it.

37:30.180 --> 37:30.820
And here I am.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.100
I'm playing it on my Xbox.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.220
So that was fun.

37:33.220 --> 37:33.700
Cool.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.200
Yep.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.140
It's a hard fucking game too, by the way.

37:37.140 --> 37:41.940
I mean, I know we all know that, but just to reiterate, Ikaruga, it's a hard fucking

37:41.940 --> 37:42.580
game.

37:42.580 --> 37:42.900
All right.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.620
It is.

37:43.620 --> 37:44.120
Yeah.

37:44.740 --> 37:44.980
All right.

37:44.980 --> 37:47.460
Well, you can get radiant silver gun for Switch.

37:48.260 --> 37:49.620
Oh, yeah, that's true.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.300
I haven't gotten anything on Switch in a while.

37:51.300 --> 37:55.380
Not since Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which I still need to go back and beat.

37:55.380 --> 37:59.060
I kind of let that wagon derail, but I keep hearing they're going to do patches.

37:59.060 --> 38:02.420
So I'm like, maybe I'll just wait for the home patch at this point, which will probably

38:02.420 --> 38:04.100
patch in a lot of performance stuff too.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.740
Even though I wasn't super bothered by it.

38:06.740 --> 38:07.140
I don't know.

38:07.140 --> 38:11.700
There's something I'm like, if I know I'm not playing the game in its final form, I

38:11.700 --> 38:13.220
get really weird about it.

38:13.220 --> 38:13.720
I don't know.

38:14.580 --> 38:15.080
All right.

38:15.940 --> 38:20.740
Let's get into some other headlines and what's going on in the gaming world, including some

38:20.740 --> 38:22.020
more bad news.

38:22.020 --> 38:22.820
But I don't know.

38:22.820 --> 38:24.180
This one I think we all saw coming.

38:24.740 --> 38:26.020
Unexpected.

38:26.020 --> 38:29.220
It's because it's Square Enix and Square Enix has.

38:30.340 --> 38:36.020
A pattern of behavior when it comes to live service games, they like to cancel them after

38:36.020 --> 38:37.140
not much support.

38:37.140 --> 38:44.740
And so, you know, now I guess this is an Embracer group that owns it, but you know, I'm still

38:44.740 --> 38:47.300
seeing this tainted by Square Enix, though.

38:47.300 --> 38:53.220
So Marvel Avengers is ending all official support, and that's going to be in September.

38:53.220 --> 38:54.180
So you still got some time.

38:54.180 --> 39:01.220
You can still play some more of it, but they're going to be basically that update 2.8, which

39:01.220 --> 39:06.820
comes out at the end of March 23rd, is going to be the end of the content and feature rollout.

39:07.540 --> 39:15.220
And they're also saying that on September 30th, all official support will end and the

39:15.220 --> 39:21.300
single player and multiplayer will still be available as well as some of the facets of

39:21.300 --> 39:21.780
the game.

39:21.780 --> 39:25.300
But there are going to be other parts that are shut down.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.140
Credits will not be purchasable.

39:27.140 --> 39:30.020
And I think the cosmetics are going to be made free.

39:30.020 --> 39:34.740
And in case you're wondering for all of those out there that may not own a Sony copy of

39:34.740 --> 39:36.580
this game, you're like, Hey, cool.

39:36.580 --> 39:37.940
Do I get Spider-Man now?

39:37.940 --> 39:39.300
No, you don't get Spider-Man.

39:39.860 --> 39:40.660
Sorry.

39:40.660 --> 39:41.700
Sony has Spider-Man.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.300
They're never going to let you have Spider-Man.

39:44.180 --> 39:44.680
That's it.

39:44.680 --> 39:51.960
I wonder if it'll stay on Game Pass, even though they're getting rid of the because

39:51.960 --> 39:54.360
you can't even buy a new digital copyright.

39:54.360 --> 39:58.120
So I'm assuming that means it'll leave Game Pass, too, which is going to be interesting.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.360
So, yeah, I don't know.

40:00.360 --> 40:04.360
I mean, look, I'm not wishful thinking about Spider-Man.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.920
I understand that's a Sony thing, but I like that I can play it on Game Pass without Spider-Man.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.080
But I didn't play it a lot.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.600
And so maybe I'm part of the problem.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.080
I don't know.

40:13.960 --> 40:18.840
Well, no, I think part of the problem is the fact that the game looked like it was a live

40:18.840 --> 40:21.320
service game that shoehorned into a single player game.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.120
Like, I think this was developed originally as like a single player game.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.480
And they're like, we want more money.

40:27.480 --> 40:32.280
And so they like shoved this like, really grindy end game into it.

40:32.280 --> 40:38.360
And people just didn't like they used a beloved license to try to create a money machine.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.040
And the whole thing was very transparent.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.400
And everyone saw right through it.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.640
That is the story of Marvel Avengers in a sentence.

40:44.200 --> 40:48.520
And it was also, I think, rough around the edges, too, when it came out, if I remember correctly.

40:48.520 --> 40:54.280
So once again, you know, rush this stuff to market so we can make as much money as possible.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.120
And yeah.

40:56.120 --> 40:56.620
Yeah.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.960
I mean, look, I'll give them this.

40:59.960 --> 41:00.520
I'll give them this.

41:01.320 --> 41:05.160
At least it wasn't EA running the game because the game would have been shut down a year

41:05.160 --> 41:06.840
and a half ago if it was EA running it.

41:06.840 --> 41:07.960
So I'll give them this.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.440
They really tried.

41:10.440 --> 41:11.880
They really tried to make it happen.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.200
I think if they didn't sell to the Embracer group,

41:14.760 --> 41:19.240
if this game wasn't sold as part of that, I think it would have been shut down earlier.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.800
I mean, look at like what Square Enix has shut down recently.

41:21.800 --> 41:27.960
They had that Final Fantasy 7 game that it was like

41:27.960 --> 41:30.920
The fact that you don't even know what the fuck it is, is very telling.

41:30.920 --> 41:36.360
I know because it's a Final Fantasy 7 game, which means it has a complicated subtitle to it.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.000
So it's like, I want to say all the breaks.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.240
I don't even know if it's all the bravest or something like that.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.080
But it was one of the ones that's like.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.880
Oh, Mike Deft with a great point.

41:45.880 --> 41:46.840
I'm still freaking bitter.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.840
What happened to Chocobo GP?

41:48.840 --> 41:49.560
That's a very good point.

41:49.560 --> 41:50.280
Yeah, that too.

41:50.280 --> 41:50.840
That too.

41:50.840 --> 41:51.160
Yeah.

41:51.160 --> 41:55.560
So it's just it's a pattern behavior from them.

41:55.560 --> 41:59.400
Just don't buy into any of their live service games.

41:59.400 --> 42:03.560
Like actually any company really wish the companies out there would like start treating

42:03.560 --> 42:07.880
live service like loot boxes, like in the sense that it's like a bad word and just,

42:07.880 --> 42:09.560
you know, people don't want it type of thing.

42:11.080 --> 42:11.880
I don't know.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.080
It's just it's annoying.

42:13.960 --> 42:17.880
Fifth Dream in chat says, what's that prequel Final Fantasy game that's a souls like or

42:17.880 --> 42:19.640
something that went nowhere?

42:19.640 --> 42:22.440
I think you're referring to Strangers of Paradise.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.440
Is that the one where the fuck chaos?

42:24.440 --> 42:26.200
Is it that one that you're thinking of?

42:27.640 --> 42:31.640
There's actually DLC coming out real soon for that, because I've been really tempted

42:31.640 --> 42:32.520
to buy it.

42:32.520 --> 42:35.320
But like, it won't go on sale enough.

42:35.320 --> 42:40.760
I should have bought it on the stinkin epic store with the 25% off coupon that probably

42:40.760 --> 42:43.480
is the best deal I was going to find for a while, but I forgot or I didn't do it.

42:44.120 --> 42:48.200
Like I'm waiting for that game to really get a deep discount before I pick that up.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.240
But I'm odd.

42:49.240 --> 42:53.560
I thought the demo for Strangers of Paradise was special.

42:54.440 --> 42:57.400
So it was a unique experience.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.840
So I would try it again for sure.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.120
So let's see.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.880
DGRMS says, I'm waiting until that game drops to $20.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.120
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at as well, for sure.

43:08.120 --> 43:12.360
So anyway.

43:12.360 --> 43:12.680
Yep.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.560
It's a bummer about what happened with the Marvel Avengers game.

43:15.560 --> 43:21.160
But again, when you are that obviously transparent about trying to milk everyone for every dollar

43:21.160 --> 43:27.560
in their wallets and every possible mini transaction you can in the game, this is what's going

43:27.560 --> 43:28.040
to happen.

43:28.040 --> 43:32.680
At least, you know, the fact they're unlocking all the cosmetics and stuff, I guess is cool.

43:33.240 --> 43:36.760
But it's one of those might as well because they've made every dollar they're going to

43:36.760 --> 43:37.560
make off that game.

43:38.520 --> 43:41.240
Might as well show the fans who stuck with you some love, right?

43:43.080 --> 43:43.880
All right.

43:43.880 --> 43:48.280
Well, one game that's done very well for itself over the years is The Witcher 3.

43:48.280 --> 43:52.600
I mean, hell, it lended itself to a television show, which yes, I know it's really about

43:52.600 --> 43:53.560
the books.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.920
But let's be real, the show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the games.

43:57.800 --> 44:04.040
So The Witcher 3 and, you know, this game's come out several times and it's getting another

44:04.040 --> 44:07.560
basically re-release because there's a next gen patch on the way.

44:07.560 --> 44:13.960
The next gen patch for the PC is in final stages, as they say, whereas the console version

44:13.960 --> 44:17.960
is actually going to be headed to retail and it's coming out on the 26th.

44:17.960 --> 44:22.600
So The Witcher 3, and I almost said The Witcher 5 because I'm thinking PlayStation 5, but

44:22.600 --> 44:27.240
The Witcher 3 next gen will be coming out for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox series

44:27.240 --> 44:29.000
on January 26.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.440
This is the complete edition.

44:30.440 --> 44:34.840
This means all of the previous DLC is there and all the quality of life improvements and

44:34.840 --> 44:36.520
all of that good stuff as well.

44:37.400 --> 44:40.920
This does not mean the PC update is coming on the 26th.

44:41.480 --> 44:45.720
The next gen patch is just at the final stages and they're saying it shouldn't be long before

44:45.720 --> 44:46.680
it's out.

44:46.680 --> 44:50.280
So whether that means one month, three months, we really don't know.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.040
We're just at the mercy of them.

44:52.040 --> 44:53.880
Bug testing, which, hey, you know what?

44:54.760 --> 44:56.040
Don't release it half bait.

44:56.040 --> 44:56.920
Get it right.

44:56.920 --> 44:59.080
So I'm sure they've got it.

44:59.080 --> 45:01.880
You know, if it is next gen, they got to make sure it still has decent performance and all

45:01.880 --> 45:02.920
that stuff too.

45:02.920 --> 45:07.240
But yeah, admittedly, I didn't play enough Witcher 3, but a next gen update will definitely

45:07.240 --> 45:10.680
get me to take another look, especially, you know, I'm running kind of a nice rig on PC

45:10.680 --> 45:11.080
now.

45:11.080 --> 45:15.000
So whenever they get that PC version out, I'd love to play it.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.040
I really would.

45:16.040 --> 45:17.640
So I'll keep an eye on that.

45:18.440 --> 45:19.320
All right, moving on.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.040
Dark Sakura.

45:20.920 --> 45:31.480
So I alluded to this before when we were talking about the layoffs and whatnot and community

45:31.480 --> 45:32.040
support.

45:33.240 --> 45:38.440
The Game Developers Conference released its annual video games industry report.

45:39.080 --> 45:44.200
We have various statistics, but one of the ones on there is the illustrated the rise

45:44.200 --> 45:47.480
of player driven harassment against game developers.

45:48.120 --> 45:55.560
They said they were very confused about the toxicity of player bases, with 75% of developers

45:55.560 --> 45:59.160
noting it was a very serious industry issue.

45:59.800 --> 46:04.840
40% of developers claimed that they had faced direct harassment or as part of a team.

46:06.120 --> 46:15.640
A portion of these respondents identified as members of the LGBTQIA plus or non male.

46:16.200 --> 46:25.320
Or non male communities and different developers have come for different tactics, including

46:26.760 --> 46:34.760
banning deplatforming the cruelest of them, which honestly I'm for.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.920
Boundaries do very much need to be set.

46:40.920 --> 46:45.320
But yeah, that's sort of like they're one of the quotes is ban, isolate and deplatform.

46:45.800 --> 46:53.240
You know, others have also said, though, that studios need to have and this is a quote,

46:53.240 --> 46:58.040
easily accessible hotlines for developers that are facing harassment to set proper

46:58.600 --> 47:02.360
boundaries and stop inviting the community to be part of the family.

47:06.440 --> 47:10.600
One developer was even saying that they had some death threats to their family.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.800
None of that is acceptable people.

47:13.800 --> 47:14.840
None of that.

47:14.840 --> 47:20.760
But the biggest thing is at the core of what they want is unionization.

47:21.320 --> 47:27.800
53% of the developers believe that they should unionize for protected rights.

47:27.800 --> 47:30.360
Only 13% of the respondents disagreed.

47:33.160 --> 47:41.080
And they're really just looking at overall protecting themselves, protecting their

47:41.320 --> 47:47.560
their livelihoods and protecting their their safety, their mental health, too.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.680
So and I'm going to say this right now.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.880
Be critical of what you love.

47:53.880 --> 47:57.960
It's the only way something can get better at the same time.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.160
Don't be a little shit about it.

47:59.160 --> 48:01.960
OK, that's unforgivable, right?

48:01.960 --> 48:09.880
These are people doing their their jobs at the direction of other people.

48:10.600 --> 48:16.920
And I mean, it's not like they're they're going around and, you know, like stabbing

48:16.920 --> 48:18.360
people in the face or something.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.800
No, if they were doing that.

48:19.800 --> 48:21.000
Yeah, fuck drag them.

48:21.560 --> 48:25.560
You know, if they were doing things that were causing harm to other people.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.680
Yeah, drag them.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.800
But they're making a game.

48:29.160 --> 48:36.040
And just because you don't like the game or something about the game, it doesn't mean

48:36.040 --> 48:43.720
that you can go out there and threaten someone's life or be that terrible to them about it.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.760
It's just you just can't.

48:45.320 --> 48:47.080
Same goes with like streamers.

48:47.080 --> 48:52.040
Don't go attacking them because they don't play the game the way that you like them to

48:52.040 --> 48:57.160
play it or or whatever, you know, or reality television stars on things like RuPaul's Drag

48:57.160 --> 48:57.660
Race.

48:58.760 --> 49:03.160
Just seeing all the hate people get on social media from that, too, is just unreal.

49:03.160 --> 49:08.440
It's if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.

49:09.480 --> 49:15.000
And if you can't be constructively and tactfully critical.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.080
Keep it to yourself.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.960
You there's paper.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.400
These things exist called journals.

49:22.520 --> 49:23.640
You can write it down there.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.400
There is a void that you can shout into.

49:26.760 --> 49:31.880
You can go to a forest where no one else is around and see if anyone can hear you if you,

49:31.880 --> 49:33.000
you know, yell into it.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.680
It's there's there's plenty of things you could do.

49:35.560 --> 49:38.120
You could you could go find some dirt and bury your head in it.

49:39.640 --> 49:40.440
Play Ostrich.

49:41.640 --> 49:42.520
Exactly.

49:42.520 --> 49:43.020
Exactly.

49:43.560 --> 49:47.960
On a serious note, though, I one of those elements that you kind of said there about

49:47.960 --> 49:50.680
kind of creating a support system for this.

49:50.680 --> 49:54.360
I mean, it's sad that that we're at the point that we need one.

49:54.360 --> 49:56.920
But recognizing that, yes, we need one.

49:56.920 --> 50:03.320
I do kind of love the concept of perhaps a an employer's employee assistance program.

50:03.320 --> 50:08.440
Many big employers, hell, even small and medium sized employers, many employers, probably

50:08.440 --> 50:13.880
yours, offer some type of EAP or employee assistance program, which is usually a type

50:13.880 --> 50:21.160
of mental health benefit because, you know, happy workers lead to productive workers.

50:21.160 --> 50:21.400
Right.

50:21.400 --> 50:22.360
And so forth.

50:22.360 --> 50:29.960
But all of those semantics aside, I'm I would I would be surprised if these companies couldn't,

50:29.960 --> 50:35.400
you know, put some of this wellness of how to deal with harassment into their employee

50:35.400 --> 50:36.840
assistance programs.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.120
So let's say help.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.720
I'm being harassed on social media and like they're coming after my family.

50:41.720 --> 50:42.440
What can I do?

50:43.000 --> 50:47.240
Maybe there can be like a crisis support through some of these employee assistance, you know,

50:47.240 --> 50:52.120
at their EA, at their Square Enix, wherever it is they work that can help them in getting

50:52.120 --> 50:52.760
through that.

50:52.760 --> 50:55.080
And, you know, support group, other people.

50:55.080 --> 50:57.400
Here's what you can do to lock down your social media.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.240
Here's, you know, what you should and shouldn't read.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.560
And, you know, those those types of things to help them through it.

51:02.760 --> 51:07.240
I would really like to call on I mean, I know nobody's fucking listening, but like you

51:07.240 --> 51:07.720
all are.

51:07.720 --> 51:12.440
But I mean, nobody influential in the industry is Bobby Kotick's not fucking listening.

51:12.440 --> 51:13.160
Okay.

51:13.160 --> 51:18.360
But I would throw out a challenge to the industry to, you know, and if it's not already in,

51:18.360 --> 51:22.280
maybe some companies, I bet a lot of them do have something like this in their EAP.

51:22.280 --> 51:26.200
But I would really like to call out to the gaming industry for their employee assistance

51:26.200 --> 51:26.680
program.

51:26.680 --> 51:29.160
A, if they don't have one, fucking get one.

51:29.160 --> 51:35.320
B, embed within that program this type of support system because unfortunately, in the

51:35.320 --> 51:37.240
year 20 and 23, it is needed.

51:38.120 --> 51:38.680
That is it.

51:39.800 --> 51:42.920
Ooh, this is the clapping emoji in chat.

51:42.920 --> 51:45.080
So you know, this is serious for Mike Deft.

51:45.080 --> 51:48.120
The same goes for localization teams.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.840
Localization is not censorship.

51:50.840 --> 51:53.480
Ooh, a thousand percent that, Mike Deft.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.120
A hundred thousand percent that for sure.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.800
Funara with a comment here, very important.

51:59.800 --> 52:03.240
The problems you face in the game are not necessarily their fault.

52:03.240 --> 52:07.800
And with all the layoffs and labor shortages, they may not have had the time or funds to

52:07.800 --> 52:08.920
test any issues.

52:08.920 --> 52:09.480
Yes.

52:09.480 --> 52:11.640
Or I mean, hell, they probably did.

52:11.640 --> 52:15.080
I mean, classic example, playing Skyrim.

52:15.960 --> 52:19.080
Doesn't Bethesda fucking test these games?

52:19.080 --> 52:20.440
Yeah, they do.

52:20.440 --> 52:24.760
And honestly, that bug was probably found and it was reported.

52:24.760 --> 52:25.640
And you know what?

52:25.640 --> 52:28.360
It was determined that bug doesn't break the game.

52:28.360 --> 52:30.520
The bug is not a, what do they call that?

52:30.520 --> 52:33.480
A stage, a stage ender, a deal.

52:33.480 --> 52:36.840
I don't remember what they call that in the industry, but it's something about, it's not

52:36.840 --> 52:38.360
a, it doesn't cut off the game.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.560
It doesn't end the game.

52:39.640 --> 52:42.440
It's not a crisis basically thing.

52:42.440 --> 52:46.040
So we're keeping it in to meet our deadline and we'll patch it up later.

52:47.160 --> 52:51.560
That's not the testing team's fault, for sure.

52:53.000 --> 52:53.800
Showstopper.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.440
Thank you, Bobby.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.160
That's what I was looking for.

52:55.160 --> 52:55.800
Showstopper.

52:57.640 --> 53:01.560
Sjo and Hunter Matt says, don't be upset or surprised when companies are reluctant to

53:01.560 --> 53:05.400
show early footage of their game because they don't want to draw the ire of the internet

53:05.400 --> 53:06.120
scum Lords.

53:06.760 --> 53:12.200
Funara says, it's like trying to attack the people in a grocery store for supply shortages

53:12.200 --> 53:15.000
or prices of industry-wide things like eggs.

53:15.000 --> 53:15.560
Oh yeah.

53:15.560 --> 53:19.960
Or God, when it was fucking toilet paper, like the people, you know, yelling at people

53:19.960 --> 53:23.800
at Costco, like, like, like it's not their problem too.

53:23.800 --> 53:24.360
It's not their fault.

53:24.920 --> 53:29.160
It's not their, like those Costco employees are also probably trying to find toilet paper

53:29.160 --> 53:30.200
or whatever it is.

53:30.200 --> 53:34.440
They want the thing and they want you to know that they're selfish and want the thing.

53:34.840 --> 53:39.960
I see this every day, even outside of just treating employees bad, just like with people

53:39.960 --> 53:43.320
just choosing which laws that they want to follow, especially traffic laws.

53:44.040 --> 53:48.760
The amount of people that run red lights near me, near a school is ridiculous.

53:48.760 --> 53:58.360
And on top of that, other people aren't calling them out, you know, like, oh, I don't want

53:58.360 --> 53:59.400
to get involved with that.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.600
That doesn't involve me.

54:00.600 --> 54:02.200
It does fucking involve me.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.480
That doesn't involve me.

54:03.480 --> 54:05.000
It does fucking involve you.

54:05.880 --> 54:13.800
You know, you, as, as a society, we sort of, we do have a responsibility to each other

54:13.800 --> 54:17.800
to make sure that the society that we're in functions properly.

54:17.800 --> 54:22.040
And I will not hesitate to tell someone they're being a little shit to the employee who can't

54:22.040 --> 54:22.920
do anything about it.

54:24.520 --> 54:27.160
And I've done it in the middle of die.

54:27.160 --> 54:32.520
So I have yelled at someone for not wearing their mask because the employee couldn't do

54:32.520 --> 54:33.020
it.

54:33.560 --> 54:37.240
I was like, do you not see that other people here have their masks on?

54:37.240 --> 54:39.880
Get out, put your mask on, and then you can come back in.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.840
I don't have to be nice to you because I'm not an employee.

54:44.120 --> 54:48.520
And I'm sure they walked right out of the store and said, what a bitch, you know, but

54:48.520 --> 54:49.720
it's like, oh, I don't care.

54:49.720 --> 54:50.520
Yeah, exactly.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.020
Good.

54:52.840 --> 54:54.200
I'm also your worst nightmare.

54:54.200 --> 54:55.480
Why don't you use that term too?

54:57.320 --> 55:02.200
I, I, well, I mean, you know, I used to do it at, um, at golf land back in the day when

55:02.200 --> 55:03.960
people were being assholes.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.640
I have no problem with speaking up.

55:06.520 --> 55:13.240
And if I see someone is being, you know, is harassing someone for their, their race or

55:13.240 --> 55:16.360
their gender, you damn well better believe I'm going to say something.

55:16.360 --> 55:21.880
And that's why this shit happens in the world because no one else stands up and says that's

55:21.880 --> 55:22.520
enough.

55:22.520 --> 55:26.680
That's, that's being an ally in those sorts of, it is up to

55:27.320 --> 55:34.120
non LGBTQ plus people to say to their non LGBTQ plus people, friends, when a joke is, or the

55:34.120 --> 55:39.560
FAG word is used or whatever it is, you know, or, or, uh, pronouns or somebody's, somebody

55:39.560 --> 55:43.480
is saying it as a pronoun or one of those types of dirty things is happening.

55:43.480 --> 55:47.320
It's up to those people to say, Hey, that's not funny.

55:47.320 --> 55:47.800
That's not cool.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.600
Don't do that.

55:48.600 --> 55:50.840
Like what, why, why are you doing that?

55:50.840 --> 55:51.720
On top of that?

55:51.720 --> 55:58.440
I mean, I, I am, you know, I have to deal with people who are going, Oh, that's not

55:58.440 --> 55:59.720
really an orientation.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.720
It's like, yeah, it is.

56:01.720 --> 56:07.320
Or having doctors try to prescribe me hormones because they think that being ace is a hormonal

56:07.320 --> 56:15.000
disease, which is not, I check out fine, you know, or having, you know, people, you know,

56:15.000 --> 56:18.920
what, after I converted saying, Oh, now you're a candidate for a gas chamber.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.520
Oh, disgusting.

56:21.240 --> 56:26.680
It's really disgusting, especially after, you know, you know, what ascended for the

56:26.680 --> 56:34.440
four years and, and, and I'm just saying, you know, that it's, it's like, you know,

56:34.440 --> 56:35.880
the things, and then they came for me.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.440
Don't wait for them to come for you.

56:39.320 --> 56:40.920
Don't let them come for anybody.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.800
To try to lighten the mood a little bit.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.680
Let me read this chat comment here because it's totally true.

56:46.760 --> 56:47.400
Sj 100.

56:47.400 --> 56:50.440
Matt says as an aside, don't pick a fight at a waffle house.

56:50.440 --> 56:51.960
The employees will mess you up.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.320
Fuck around and find out.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.000
Yeah, that is true.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.160
As a connoisseur of many a waffle house acts.

57:01.160 --> 57:01.640
I do.

57:01.640 --> 57:02.440
I do.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.720
I completely understand.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.640
We're never getting waffle house in California.

57:05.640 --> 57:11.000
I also understand for those that live in California, waffle house gets severely overrated.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.560
Like it's like the rest of you in and out to be quite frankly.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.880
But it's, it's one of those issues.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.120
I do wish we had waffle house in California.

57:18.120 --> 57:20.840
Cause I'm going to tell you Denny's is not it.

57:20.840 --> 57:21.480
Period.

57:21.480 --> 57:23.080
Denny's is not it.

57:23.640 --> 57:28.600
There's only one place I have eaten at that the food tastes just like it does a waffle house.

57:28.600 --> 57:32.040
And that's that Ed's place in San Francisco over on Fillmore.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.920
It's been open since 1972.

57:34.920 --> 57:39.000
And they're probably just trying to emulate the waffle house strategy to be fair.

57:39.640 --> 57:44.760
Honestly, I think I have a theory that it was open by somebody who had waffle,

57:44.760 --> 57:45.960
who went to waffle houses.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.400
Like I like this.

57:47.400 --> 57:48.360
I'm going to make this.

57:49.720 --> 57:52.280
And of course we all know about the waffle house index.

57:52.280 --> 57:54.440
I mean, even the house is closed run.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.360
Even though the food is pretty shit.

57:56.360 --> 57:59.720
Like I'm just, you know, it's, it's, it's comfort food.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.160
I understand, but it's pretty shit.

58:01.160 --> 58:01.480
Comfort.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.840
Look, Taco Bell food is shit too, but it's comfort food.

58:04.840 --> 58:05.160
Okay.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.840
So Taco Bell food is actual shit.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.720
I don't care.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.400
No, that's still taco all the way.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.160
I will say, yeah.

58:13.160 --> 58:16.600
Why would you ever go to Taco Bell when there's a Del Taco there on the same street?

58:16.600 --> 58:17.000
Why?

58:17.000 --> 58:18.520
I like what fifth stream says.

58:18.520 --> 58:21.800
It's it's like a bar Wolverine would hang out in, but with hash browns.

58:23.560 --> 58:24.040
I forgot.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.680
I forgot what I was going to say about waffle house now.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.040
The food is shit, but it's comforting.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.720
And yes, it's exactly, it's comfortable.

58:31.720 --> 58:33.000
It's in a comforting environment.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.680
You, you know what you're going to fucking get at three in the morning at waffle house.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.720
You know, the coffee is going to be hot.

58:41.720 --> 58:44.280
They'll always put on a fresh pot for you.

58:44.280 --> 58:48.040
You can get those hash brown covered smothered chunked, diced.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.480
There's this and always order your waffle.

58:51.480 --> 58:52.280
Well done.

58:52.280 --> 58:56.360
There's this, there's a certain cadence to the, I mean, it's literally all in front of

58:56.360 --> 58:56.520
you.

58:56.520 --> 58:59.160
You can watch them make the fucking food from start to finish.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.320
Not a lot of chains to do the food.

59:01.880 --> 59:03.000
There's not a lot of chains to do that.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.840
Throw a chair at a waffle house employee and they will parry it like Daigo.

59:10.600 --> 59:11.100
True.

59:11.800 --> 59:12.200
All right.

59:12.200 --> 59:13.960
Anyway, let's see what else is there.

59:13.960 --> 59:18.120
Bobby Black Wolf says a bag of waffle house grits in my pantry and I'm about to make them.

59:18.120 --> 59:21.720
Bobby Black Wolf says we're soon getting in and outs in Tennessee in a few years.

59:21.720 --> 59:23.480
So soon we won't care about it anymore.

59:24.040 --> 59:27.480
It's like that fucking raising canes just opened up on every block here.

59:27.480 --> 59:31.400
And at first it was like, wow, we're finally getting raising canes.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.760
Literally, it's like three months later and it's like, okay, everybody stopped caring.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.240
Well, they also have now came out here.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.200
What, Loki?

59:42.200 --> 59:47.880
I was going to say they also have now like, um, all the hot chicken, Nashville hot chicken

59:47.880 --> 59:52.840
places before it used to be like, hey, ooh, national, uh, national proper.

59:52.840 --> 59:53.880
Heck yeah.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.320
I like I'm craving that.

59:55.320 --> 59:57.320
And it's like, oh, hey, there's a restaurant, national tender.

59:57.880 --> 59:58.520
I'll try that out.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:09.400
Nashville, uh, nations, nations, like a Nashville hot.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.120
Oh, got it.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:10.360
Okay.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:10.840
Okay.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.080
It's, it's like fried chicken with like, they put it like way too much spice on it to where

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.920
it's like you just in torture.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.560
I love it though.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.040
It's great.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.000
And he's, you know, serve it on a piece of, uh, white bread and pickles and stuff.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.280
You know, it's good stuff.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.480
Chicken stress.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.360
But, um, they have like now Dave's hot chicken.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.880
There's like all like so many hot chicken places now.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.400
And they're not all of them are great.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.000
Oh, I want crystals so I can eat my corn pups in peace.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.640
Here's what you should all be jealous of on the East coast that you don't have that we

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:43.960
have.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.920
It's a newer thing.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.160
And I'm telling you, this place is addicting AF and I'm sure my co-hosts are going to roll

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:49.640
their eyes.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.200
I don't care.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.920
I think the thing y'all are missing is Dutch brothers.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.680
That my eyes are rolling so far that I'm going to fall out of my chair.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.720
Like I love me too.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.320
It's it's and yeah, I say that as I'm not drinking Dutch brothers on stream, but it's

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.760
because because the drive-throughs are always a fucking you think in and out drive-through

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:11.320
lines are long.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.600
Go to a fucking Dutch brothers.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.080
Jesus.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.600
Dutch brothers are to the coffee world.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.600
What Apple is to the technology world.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.880
You'll have people that just.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.200
I'm like why the people that purchase their products?

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:26.600
Hold on.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.920
Let me describe what you're saying on my iPhone.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.320
Yes.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.120
What were you saying?

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.200
What I'm saying is overrated.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.720
My iPhone is a webcam.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.320
They insist they insist on placing their plopping down their stupid businesses.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.680
I say plop because it's shit.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.520
They plop it down in like the most inconvenient places ever because it's the size of like

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.400
one of those photos.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.200
This is probably predating a lot of people.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:52.680
Sorry.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.680
You kids know what a photo booth is?

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:54.840
Yeah.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.080
Do you know what a photo booth is?

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:57.720
A photo mat?

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:57.960
Yeah.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.360
Where you know they can drive through photo mat.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.800
Those photo booths now will post to your Facebook automatically.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.000
That's the new thing they all do.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:05.880
Okay.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.200
Well, this is a drive-through photo mat like back when we had film cameras.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:10.920
Okay.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.000
And so they're like that size.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.600
Like the small checkers.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.560
Think of think of like the size of your utility shed in the backyard or something like that.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.640
They converted that into a coffee place and decided to park it in the middle of a parking

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:23.880
lot.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.800
And so there's no adequate...

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.320
They have drive-through lines going two different directions sometimes or it's just weaving

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.960
through everywhere and blocking everything because they're ill-prepared to serve the

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.560
amount of customers that they have because they don't have a storefront because I guess

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.440
that costs too much or it's not like cool enough.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.800
And then the worst part about it, and don't get me wrong, like I'm sure their coffee is

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.440
good and I have no problem with the coffee.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:55.400
What I have a problem with is the people that go there and then decide, hey, you know what

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:55.960
we're going to do?

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.840
I'm going to put a crap ton of your products, advertising, bumper stickers all over the

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.080
fuck my van and my car.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.200
I see that shit fucking everywhere and it's really annoying.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.320
Too expensive for me to put stickers all over it.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:11.560
Okay.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.920
I'll say what they did to tie it back to video games.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.720
They've stolen the Xbox achievement system for their app.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.360
And I know like Alan actually is like, oh, if I go today, I can get like a heart sticker

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:22.840
for my eyes.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.280
It's not even a real sticker, but apparently if you go on the first of the month, they

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.400
do give you a real sticker.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.920
So that's a thing.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.720
Anyway.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.360
Oh my gosh.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:30.760
Okay.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.720
So they're the kindergarten class of like coffee places.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.120
Low-key, they're so good.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.200
Say this as I have an actual sticker book.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.280
And you can get non-coffee drinks there too.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.840
And they're not even paying me to say this, but they should pay me in coffee.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.560
Jesus.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.320
But you can get like energy drinks and non-coffee things there too.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:47.640
Yeah.

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.080
I know that they have stuff.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.320
I've gone there and gotten a coffee before, but like I will never do it again.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.360
Torani Syrup Bar.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.320
That's all that place is.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.280
But anyway, just a couple of comments in chat here on the food, and then I'm going to move

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:00.520
on.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:06.280
Number one, Pod Culture in chat says White Castle greater than Crystal's?

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.240
Crystal's.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.280
I almost said Crystalis.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.720
I would love a White Castle.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.480
I've never actually had like IRL White Castle other than like the microwave stuff.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.960
White Castle is the most disgusting fucking fast food I've ever had in my life.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.240
That is the most, like you could not have a more wrong opinion.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.400
Sorry, Pod Culture.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.200
I don't know Crystal's.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.160
So maybe, but that was, I had it in Vegas.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.280
That was disgusting.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.000
Crystal is kind of the same theory as White Castle, but I always have to tell them not

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.120
to put any mustard or pickle on my sandwich.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:44.280
But they have an amazing thing on their menu that I greatly miss, and that is the Corn

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.240
Pup is tiny little corn dogs.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.600
Oh, that's tiny little corn dogs.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.200
It's just the steaming of the burger.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.560
No, no.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.400
I remember when we were so desperate to get Dunkin Donuts, and we have one near us now,

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:05.400
and I really wish it was Krispy Kreme instead, because I don't like Dunkin.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:12.200
I love Dunkin Donuts because I can get more cake-style donuts rather than what they had

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.000
at Krispy Kreme.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.280
And I grew up with freaking Krispy Kreme, and I'm very sad that the one from the 50s

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.800
that was on Government Street in Mobile is gone.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.480
Pisses me the fuck off.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:31.480
But I like, when I came out here and had donuts that were not from Krispy Kreme for the first

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:37.560
time in my life, I was like, cake donuts, a lot of cake donuts.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:43.720
Yeah, I will say the food at Krispy Kreme is better than Dunkin, but the coffee is better

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.240
at Dunkin than it is at Krispy Kreme.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.040
But you're right, that is the one thing that California seemingly has that I do notice

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.320
is that because we don't have a lot of Krispy Kreme and Dunkin, there's a lot of mom and

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.760
pop donut shops.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.240
And I will say, nothing beats those.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.480
Nothing beats those for donuts.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.400
I do like, I really do like, though, they're just regular glazed donuts.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.200
So like the Krispy Kreme ones, I could eat those like by the dozen.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:16.360
But that's the thing I missed about the one on Government Street, because it had the conveyor

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.480
in the back where they cooked them.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.320
Oh, that was awesome.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.120
And you go in when the hot sign is on.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.960
And that was when they were the best.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.680
Yeah, we had one by the mall, and then it became a Panera Bread.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.400
What was the big chain that was at Winchell's that used to be all over California?

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.320
Now, I think they're only in Southern California, but most mom and pop shops are pretty much

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:42.120
Winchell's are pretty much that, like, is that it's pretty much what all mom and pop

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.840
stores are modeled after.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.400
Okay, there was one other food comment because I had to get to it.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.040
And now I don't.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.160
Oh, dang, where was it?

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.080
So y'all are going off on food.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.960
I'm like, do we spend too much time talking about food on this show?

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.800
And then like, y'all blow up the chat.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.040
Yeah, see, Fifth Dream says, I like Dairy Queen food.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.800
I'm not going to lie.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.520
It's so bad.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.400
But where else can you get country gravy, Texas toast with chicken strips?

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.440
That's a good idea.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:15.400
The only thing I don't like about Dairy Queen, and this is just it saddens me so much.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:20.600
So Dairy Queen purchased Orange Julius, and then Orange Julius disappeared out of the

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.560
malls, and they used to have Orange Julius available at Dairy Queen.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.000
Now they don't have it at all.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
They have made Orange Julius extinct.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.600
And that makes me so sad.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.800
This word did used to be good.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.440
Okay, the comment was from Mike Deft.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.960
And it was a response to we were talking about Taco Bell and Del Taco.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.360
And he said something along the lines of it's all shit.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.520
What did he say?

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.440
Oh, all of those Mexican fast food are shit with Mexican in quotes.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.520
And that is from our resident listener that actually lives in Mexico.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.960
Unless it's Jim Boys, and then it just gives you the shits.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.240
Here's the thing about Taco Bell and Del Taco and all that.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.640
Taco Bell is not Mexican food.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.600
It is Taco Bell.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.360
You have to go into it.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.960
Taco Bell is not Mexican food.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.000
It's just not food.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.760
It's Southern California food.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.120
If I want something that resembles Mexican food, I would go to, like, Chando's Tacos

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.400
or something that is a lot more like authentic street taco type of fare.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.040
Well, Chando's is extremely greasy.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.040
Near my house, but I cannot eat at Jim Boys because it makes me immediately sick.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.600
Jim Boys is one of the...

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.400
It's honestly my first week out here.

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.760
Dan took me to Jim Boys.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.320
I'll leave it at that.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.920
When Shane lived with us for a little bit, we went to Jim Boys one day and Shane was like,

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.200
never again.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.360
That was me.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.080
Jim Boys.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:37.400
I know.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:37.960
I love Jim Boys.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.000
Their tacos are good.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:39.480
I don't know.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.120
All right.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:40.600
But Chando's...

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.800
I thought I had a cast iron digestive system.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.760
No, I don't.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.600
Chando's is good, except for their...

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.040
Like, I used to get their, like, kind of stuffed quesadillas that they have.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.240
And it's just like, it's just grease.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.840
It's solid grease.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.560
That's the only thing.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.240
It's like so heavy and so bad.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:07.560
And then they also have their street corn, which I love Elodie, but it's sour.

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:11.160
Like, I don't think it's supposed to be sour.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.240
Like, it's not good sour.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.400
I've had a lot of street corn from a different bunch of different places, and it's sour,

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.600
like sour milk.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:19.960
All right.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.160
Clearly, we've derailed with Orange Challenge Fudio.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.960
Let's try to get back.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960
Hey, look, what do we do when we play video games?

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.760
We eat.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:32.520
Let's move on into some other gaming headlines, which, you know, kind of along the lines of

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.920
harassment a little bit and social media behavior.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.480
I don't know.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:35.980
Loki?

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:38.680
Yeah.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:47.640
So, of course, we have Phil Spencer saying that he's praising devs for releasing games

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.320
among the culture of cancellation.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.080
So first, when I read this, like, I wasn't sure if they were talking about, like, you

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:00.520
know, all the different canceled games like Ubisoft and stuff, but they're talking about

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.160
the current culture of criticism and cancellation.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:09.720
I guess being that indie developers are more likely to just kind of bring their vision

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.480
to fruition and not really care about outside influences.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.480
Whereas if you have something kind of studio made or something like that, you might get

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.600
a lot more exec kind of influence over stuff.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:28.120
But basically, we are we all of us here today, all of our teams around the globe, separate

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.320
the 10,000 people that we let go.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.000
We are all part of creating this echo effect of joy.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.280
Bravely and intentionally release their visions to the world, particularly in the current

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:45.480
culture of criticism and cancellation, our players who bravely and intentionally carve

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.520
out time for games to invite rest and rejuvenate their lives and business leaders.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.880
We call upon them and have the courage to protect and nurture this collective joy.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.080
I think what they're talking about mainly was like some of the more recent games like

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.720
High on Life is a weird game and that they just kind of, you know.

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.200
Let it be weird, I guess.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.640
I mean, here's the thing.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.080
I actually don't think Phil Spencer's comments are as terrible as people are making them

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080
out to be, and maybe I'm giving him too much credit.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.440
But here's the thing.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.600
I think like when I was reading this story on some websites, like for I'm just to say

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.120
say what it is like when I was reading the headline on Kotaku, I noticed they changed

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.560
the quote to remove the word criticism and they just put the cancellation.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:31.560
And I felt when I was reading that story that they were trying to project like the Hogwarts

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.600
Legacy discussion because that's the ongoing cancellation right now, right?

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.040
They were trying to project that onto Phil Spencer's comments.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:45.560
But when I read Phil Spencer's comments as a standalone, I more see it in light of the

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.880
story Jamie just talked about and a lot of the crap that developers have to put up with

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:50.760
online.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.520
And sometimes, yeah, I would actually label some of that like cancellation.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.360
It's shitty cancellation attempts.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:02.920
It's cancellation that's just, you know, and we all know that's a silly word anyway.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.200
A lot of it is accountability culture and so forth anyway.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.400
But I digress.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.760
I don't want to get too far into those.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:15.160
I just feel like when I was reading a lot of the gaming media's reports on this quote

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.960
that they were projecting something onto it that I don't think Phil, unless Phil Spencer

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:28.120
said like Hogwarts Legacy or like what other, unless he said that, I'm not sure I would

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.000
jump from this to this in that conclusion.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.720
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.080
Maybe I'm being naive.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.080
Maybe I'm giving Phil Spencer too much credit.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.960
I feel like he's earned a little bit of credit from some of the things he's done in this

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:38.460
industry.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.960
But, you know, and also not everybody always says eloquent things.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.680
I can respect developers and still say, oh boy, did you put your foot in your mouth?

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.080
For example, Naoki Oshida and the comments about Final Fantasy 16.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:13:01.320
I respect the guy a lot, but oof, you know, but I also recognize how much of that is him

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.960
and how much of that is like the Japanese game development industry.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.400
But that's a whole other Oprah.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.600
I just think this, you know, I don't know.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.480
I feel like a different argument is being put on Phil Spencer that I'm not sure he was

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.600
trying to get involved with.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.160
But that's my thought.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.240
Anyway, all right, moving on.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:29.160
Let's talk about Arcade 1UP because, you know, we talk about those machines on this show

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:29.880
a little bit.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.320
And we also talk about them on our Discord server sometimes because, you know, some of

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.800
these pictures of machines and stuff show up on our Discord.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.160
Plus, you know, the good old I'm banned from Bobby Black Wolf's arcade because I get high

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.600
scores on his machines.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.120
This all gets elaborated on with pictures in the Discord and all of that.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.240
So over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.600
This story was actually posted in the Orange Launch Radio channel about did Arcade 1UP

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.560
actually violate an emulator license?

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.280
And it was a link to a Reddit post in the emulation subreddit.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.200
But it reads this.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:11.400
The Arcade 1UP Simpsons Bowling Unit is reportedly based on Duck Station, which is a GPL3 licensed

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.600
product project.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.760
I've looked around and there doesn't appear to be historic versions under any other license.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:21.400
They are actively denying requests for the source code, which when the GPL requires for

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.920
them to make it available.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.080
I was also sent similar via DM by someone else who requested the source.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.000
I was told before that Arcade 1UP had cleaned up their act.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.920
They had previously been caught using non-commercial versions of MAME in their products.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.160
But based on this, it seems it's not the case.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.840
Based on what has been said, this is nothing more than another bootleg product claiming

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.720
to be fully licensed.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.400
Interesting development.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.200
And by the way, thank you 13X Forever who posted that in our Discord.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:51.640
But interesting development that came up since that was posted, actually, within the last

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:57.800
couple of days, Arcade 1UP, if you go to their GitHub over at github.com slash Arcade 1UP,

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.000
they have posted the source.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:07.080
So calling them out, actually, they were in the position where, oops, I guess they were.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.360
So I guess it is an admission.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.280
Yes, we were using the duck station, which I'm sure it wasn't too hard to figure it out.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.960
And they posted the source code.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.480
So here's the completely fair dragging of Arcade 1UP.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.760
And, you know, obviously that was a little shady what they did and so forth.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.800
And a lot of people, you know, I've been read sometimes for buying these things because

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.200
it's like, why don't you why don't you mod these things?

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.640
You could get more games in him.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.000
Or why do you not get the real cabinet or anything like that?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.280
And it's like, yeah, I will number one, the real cabinets are a bitch to get upstairs.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.640
And that's where my games are.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.920
I'm moving a pinball.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.120
Yeah, it's these work a lot better upstairs.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.880
Let's let's put that or downstairs in the case of Black Wolf Manor.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.400
These games get up and downstairs a lot easier.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.680
But also be I realize they're not the real thing.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.000
They're collectibles, especially this BurgerTime machine is limited edition 3000.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.040
It is a collectible.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.600
I like the aesthetic.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.960
I think these, especially the Tron one with the built in black lights, like it looks really

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:12.600
cool.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.280
I realize it's not the real thing with the real CRT television, all that.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:21.240
But you know what, when those machines break, they are a fucking beast to repair because

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.040
no one makes CRT televisions anymore.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.920
So I find these things as a kind of a happy kind of medium for collecting and so forth.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.560
So but I want them to follow all the rules.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.280
Like I don't I understand that a lot of this stuff is going to be emulated in this day

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:36.780
and age.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:43.320
But emulations come a long way from the days of the earliest main main stuff and all that

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.560
stuff is like, you know, this is when I play this Tron machine, I feel like I'm playing

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:53.640
the old arcade game, save for the joystick is a little less durable than what you'd see

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.600
in the real arcade machine.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:59.080
But other than that, the game itself, I feel like I'm playing the real game and it's a

01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.580
lot of fun.

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.860
I still want the Marvel pinball from arcade one up.

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:07.580
Even though it's a digital pinball, I still think it would be funny.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:08.220
It's still cool.

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.860
So Bobby Black Wolf says in the case of Black Wolf Manor, there's no stairs.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.700
We take them around the house in the basement door.

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.580
That's Oh, that's right.

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:18.060
I forgot you have a back a backyard door.

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:18.380
That's right.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.980
That's how you get the pinball machines in there.

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.700
Of course.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.200
All right.

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:26.300
Dejirama S says you could get an arcade mini cab with tons of arcade games in it, but that's

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.580
bootleg AF.

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:32.780
And Rama, I'm going to really ruffle feathers with this comment, but that's my opinion.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.780
Most of those cabinets look bootleg as fuck.

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:39.260
That's why I like these.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:44.460
To me, especially this Tron one is incredibly faithful to the original, about as close as

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:48.220
you can get when it's three quarters of the size of the old one.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:52.540
You know, a lot of those other machines, they look like bootleg arcade machines to me.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.100
That's not to say I'll never get one.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:59.980
Again, I keep pointing out I have a nice open available space still.

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:01.980
And you know what's funny?

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.820
Alan and I have even talked about like, you know, we don't really use the kitchen table.

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.100
And if we got rid of the kitchen table, we'd have more space downstairs.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:13.260
Rob, what?

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.140
Tell me if you remember, we had the dining room table in my house.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.180
Do you know what's been since put away in favor of pinball tables?

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.380
The dining room table.

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:25.100
dining room table.

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.340
We have we have a smaller kitchen table and even that's a gaming table.

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.860
It's a bumper pool underneath it.

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:35.820
But like, but your house is you and Dan, my house, me and Alan.

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:41.420
How often do we sit down at the dinner table and have dinner with our significant other

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.140
to talk about?

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.580
It doesn't happen.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.020
We do.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.380
Well, sometimes we might go out to eat and do that or something.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.700
Or we might both sit in the living room and chat.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.380
We don't like sit at the dinner table.

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.420
How do you do it?

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.620
You got rid of your dinner table.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.420
You can't do it.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.580
No, we have the we have the kitchen table.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.900
Oh, yeah, you have your little one that's got the bumper pool in it.

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.340
Yeah, I remember eating pizza there once.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:02.700
Yeah.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:06.140
And so we have we have people over and we eat at the table, you know.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:12.380
But like we were even talking about like, I kind of want to, you know, put that somewhere

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:18.460
else and get like one of those little folding leaf tables that you could just unfold the

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:23.020
one side and then have like a little nook area and then have the rest of the kitchen

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:23.520
open.

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:27.500
I like to our very first house, the house I grew up in, we had a instead of a kitchen

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.060
table, we had an actual like restaurant booth.

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.740
We had a like a booth.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:32.380
I like that.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.020
The one thing I don't like about those.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.540
I'm just just saying is that if someone in the middle has to get up and pee.

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:40.700
Yeah, true.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:42.240
Yeah.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.900
And then they're kind of a pain to clean.

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:45.360
All right.

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:47.260
Anyway, let's move on.

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.500
Uh, following up on something from last week, right?

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.000
Dark soccer.

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:51.760
Yep.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:57.920
This makes me actually kind of upset because.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.160
Bubba is still in dead by daylight.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:10.800
That code piece was put in the PTB to catch the leaker.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.360
Oh, wow.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.280
But there I go.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.480
My Jennifer Coolidge again.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.880
I didn't know that that's what it was.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.560
Oh, I just I just okay.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.060
I agree.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.200
It's you still see Steve, Nancy and demo.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.000
You would have seen Bubba.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.360
You'd never truly be rid of Bubba.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:33.440
Yeah, that was that was the theory is that they would just leave him in, but no one could

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.320
buy him again.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.120
Like even I was talking when I was playing with Raven early this morning, you know, she

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.160
was even like, I was going to wait for I didn't I don't have Bubba yet.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.160
I was going to wait for him to go on sale before they got rid of him.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.280
And now they're not getting rid of him.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:55.280
But yeah, it was actually posted on the Dead by Daylight Twitter dead by behavior BHVR.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.880
Yeah, he's not going anywhere with a picture.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.400
And of course, that picture being here, I'll actually just link the tweet with the photo.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.920
At least for those in chat, other people, you'll have to look for it.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.420
Sorry.

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:17.700
It's basically Dwight on a elf Dwight on a hook with a Bubba in the background.

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.460
Ready to go, because face camping Bubbas.

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:28.420
But yeah, they said, nope, he still got business to take care of in the entities realm.

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.460
We'll let you know if a licensed character ever needs to leave us.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:37.780
But this was, you know, when they did the confirmation with leaks by Daylight.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:44.500
They they actually said that that they were I mean, they've been very accurate over so many

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.660
things like outfits and whatnot, and collaborations.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:53.780
Oh, and the person that runs it apparently said that they were just gonna stop posting

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:55.540
content leaks.

01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:00.180
Like just basically stick with like the wardrobe stuff or whatever.

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.100
And I'm like, let's just knock it off.

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:14.340
But this is an attempt to try to catch some of the people who were leaking.

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.980
But in this case, I mean, it was actually just PTB data mining.

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:29.380
But there was another thing on here from Reddit, where they said that they,

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:40.900
they said that they gave a comment to a few of the different people they suspected of leaking.

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.380
Basically, this was set up like one of those canary traps,

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:51.300
you know, put the false information out there, find who leaked it.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:51.860
Interesting.

01:22:52.020 --> 01:23:01.300
Um, so, and then, yeah, I mean, and but there's the one person who said seems like this is the

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:06.580
end of this trip from MGA 9678 on a Reddit discussion.

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:14.660
But I mean, I do kind of agree with what another Reddit user said.

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:18.100
And I'll quote if this brings back some of the excitement and mystery around

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.100
chapter teasers again, that it's not all bad.

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:27.940
Um, but I mean, I like I like seeing this.

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.780
It makes me more excited for it when I get to see the preview of it, you know?

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.280
Yeah.

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:40.740
Um, I, I like those things, although I did kind of liked when, when they were teasing

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:51.940
uh, uh, the Hell Priest Cenobite, that they put up the footage in the, um, in, uh, on the TV.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:58.740
And for anyone who's seen Hellraiser, they know that that's what the precursor

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.180
to, um, the Hell Priest showing up.

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:02.680
Yeah.

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:07.140
Yeah. So I like, or when they did the artist, we were all like,

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:12.340
like some of us knew right away, oh, that's going to be something you have to do with like artwork

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.060
or something.

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:19.540
And, you know, and even going back to like naming certain artists who had done this kind of work,

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:25.780
it was, I liked, I liked when we had those kinds of teasers and guesswork and to see who was right

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:29.940
and who wasn't and, you know, building up that excitement for it.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:35.540
But I also did like every so often having someone vindicated or not vindicated, but confirm it for

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.740
me a little early, you know?

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:40.900
I don't think the leaks ever really like hurt anyone or the game.

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.740
Like, you know, the design does that plenty.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.260
But it broke my heart because I want Bubba gone.

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.940
So people won't stop playing face camping asshole Bubbas.

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:51.700
He was never going to get fully removed.

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.620
They're not going to be able to take it from people that already bought it.

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.300
Like that would be very challenging.

01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:05.140
I still think that they need to implement my idea, patent pending, of, um, having it like,

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:13.060
like for camping killers, having them be pushed out of the area or giving a longer endurance boost,

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.900
not just to the hooked, but to the unhooker.

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:17.300
I agree.

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:21.460
The hook timer in the post hook endurance timer should be based off of the proximity

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.820
of the killer and how long they stood.

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:28.020
Like if, if the killer stands right next to the hook, it should basically build the hook

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.940
time the longer the killer standing there.

01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:37.940
I will say, however, that that has won many a match for people who have been hooked near

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:38.580
the exit gates.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:40.580
All right.

01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:42.900
Uh, let's move on.

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.740
The hook timer should stop if the killer is not out of the area.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.380
No, I agree.

01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:49.700
All right, let's move on.

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:52.580
Let's, uh, talk about some more, uh, I guess followups.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.020
Cause I feel like we were talking about this company the other week, but Loki.

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:56.260
Yeah.

01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:00.500
We were talking about cancellations by Ubisoft last week and some unknown games and stuff.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:05.300
One of these, of course, was apparently an online hero battler called Project Q.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.980
It was one of those three games that got, uh, canceled.

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.100
The one we talked about that last week, uh, because they have,

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:16.100
haven't been having a successful year apparently.

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.740
Um, and then confirmed it.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.060
Yes.

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:24.180
Project Q development team was being reassigned to other endeavors and projects within the studio.

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:29.860
And I guess it was a PvP shooter first announced in April, 2022.

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.620
I don't remember anything about it.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.700
So neat.

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:41.460
Um, and then of course they still insist that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development.

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.540
Duke Nukem forever all over again.

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:48.180
Yeah, I know.

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:51.140
I wonder how many times it will be great when it comes out.

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:51.620
I'm sure.

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:56.100
I wonder how many times it stopped and started development in that too.

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:56.820
Turned it over.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:57.060
Yeah.

01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:59.700
It's that happened at least once.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:04.020
Cause when they started developing that game, they were probably developing it for the PS3.

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:07.140
I think it's been like 15 years now or something.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:07.380
Yeah.

01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.660
15 years.

01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:12.820
So I really don't care at this point.

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:15.700
Just like either release or don't like, I don't care.

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:18.740
Just, I don't need to be told that it's still in development.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.380
Or just tell me you canceled it and restarted it.

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:22.100
You know?

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:22.500
Yeah.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.260
Just say, hey, we just started development because we had the cancel development.

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.300
Yeah, whatever.

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:34.020
Well, something else that was canceled before it ever started was Walu Peach.

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:35.860
That's right.

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:43.300
It was, uh, I guess Walu Peach was a character that had been pitched, uh, in a tweet.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:43.700
Let's see.

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:49.780
It was an interview with Shugo Takahashi, uh, about the creation of Waluigi, uh, and

01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:52.580
talking about, you know, what was going on with the creation of that.

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:58.100
But apparently, uh, Nintendo was open to other ideas and they, the team tried to pitch Walu

01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:59.860
Peach for the next game.

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:06.260
But Miyamoto said, no, vetoed it even before seeing the design, which I can only imagine

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:08.820
what the design for Walu Peach would have looked like.

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:14.500
But Miyamoto said, I know it's going to be just like Doro and Joe, so don't bother.

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:20.100
Doro and Joe, and I'm probably saying there's Doro and Joe, uh, is an anime villain from

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.060
Yatterman.

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:23.700
Uh, and so, uh, love Yatterman.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.060
That's a Tatanoko one.

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:25.300
Yeah.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.860
So Miyamoto was like, no, not even don't even want to see it stop.

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:32.820
So what could have been, what could have been?

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:34.340
Doro and Joe looks pretty awesome.

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:36.340
Might be a little too spicy for Nintendo though.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:39.380
All right.

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:44.260
Well, let's get to, if we're going to talk about classic games, I think now's a good

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.660
time to bring in our next segment.

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:48.100
So let's get to it.

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:04.340
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.580
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.300
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.540
And what did you pick for us tonight, Dark Sakura?

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:20.740
The game I am streaming on Saturday night, Star Ocean, as in the original Star Ocean.

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:26.100
It came out in 1996, um, on the Super Famicom.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:29.620
It was developed by Tri-Ace and published by Enix.

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.300
Yes, that Enix.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.940
It is the very first of those games.

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:40.820
It was released July, 1996, and was the first game developed by Tri-Ace that was, uh, mostly

01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:45.700
made up of staff that had left Wolf Team being unhappy with the development for Tales of

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.940
Fantasia with Namco in 1995.

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:54.740
It uses a special compression chip to compress and store all the games data, um, because

01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:57.620
the graphics in it really pushed the limits of the Super Famicom.

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:03.380
Um, the game also had voice acting for the game's intro and voice clips that played

01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.980
throughout battle gameplay.

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:16.100
Um, and it, I, it's a really complicated story so far, but it has these three friends who

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:23.460
experience a new disease and they come into contact with, uh, with people from a space

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.580
faring federation.

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:26.020
Like it almost sounds like Star Trek.

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:26.520
Okay.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:33.140
Um, and they find a time travel device that lets them go back in time to try to find

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.100
the cure for their planet.

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:44.980
Um, it, it's, it was never released like just outside, only, only in, uh, Japan because

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:47.860
the American branch closed shortly before the game was finished.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:54.820
And then they were also doing a little bit more focusing on Nintendo 64 stuff, but the

01:30:54.820 --> 01:31:00.980
game was actually remade by Tose for, uh, the PSP as Star Ocean First Departure.

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:07.700
And, uh, it was released in North America, Europe and Australia, October, 2008.

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:12.660
And then there's a remastered, which is Star Ocean First Departure R for the Switch and

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.700
PlayStation 4 that came out in December of 2019.

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:21.140
And it was the start of the entire Star Ocean series, which is six games, three spinoffs

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.660
to remake a remaster and a manga.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:31.460
Um, but going back to the original Star Ocean, it is a top-down RPG.

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.700
I'm not seeing anything on the window.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:35.620
Oh, there it is.

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.260
Okay.

01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:37.620
It's a top-down RPG.

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:45.860
Um, and you, you walk around your party as, you know, compressed into one person, interacting

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.500
with players.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:56.180
Um, and then you have, like, when you're in battle, you're, it's sort of like Secret

01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:01.620
of Mana this way, where you do have a dedicated battle screen and you can control one character

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.660
and the other to have tactics for how they fight.

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:11.300
Um, and, uh, you don't really have like a world map.

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:15.060
You have like a mini map sort of thing, but it's still not much help.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:20.100
Um, but you can recruit up to eight additional characters to go with you.

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:25.620
Some happen automatically, some depend on actions that you did in the past.

01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:31.060
Um, but there are up to 10 characters that are able to be recruited, even though you

01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.420
can only recruit eight.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:38.020
So it does allow some replayability and it has something, you know, it does contribute

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:41.060
to the way the story, uh, plays out.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:49.460
Um, so, uh, at any rate, um, the combat is that 3D isometric view.

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:56.660
Um, but like I said, you, you have battle strategies that your others use, um, you know,

01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:59.700
that are basically AI characters, and then you have your own thing.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:05.460
Um, you can get special points, uh, called SP from battle and they're used to customize

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.180
your abilities.

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:12.980
So for example, you could give SP to cooking and then you can make food out of just raw

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.420
material that you'll find.

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:22.180
Um, you can have people who can create weapons, um, upgrade items, um, and then individuals

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.900
can have, uh, up to 20 items.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:27.700
There's also private actions, which I think are cool.

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:34.100
So like, like for example, and I'm still right at the start, but there's a part when you

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.860
first go into the past and your, your team of four is separated.

01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:45.620
And so you have the main guy and then the Iria, who is like, uh, the second in command

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:50.580
on the spaceship and she's wearing very futuristic clothes that don't fit the planet.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.060
So the main guy has to go and find clothes for her.

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:58.100
So they actually have one of these private actions right at the beginning where they

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:04.260
discuss, like, do you want to risk me going in or do you want me to just stay here?

01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.780
And, you know, I said, stay here while I look around, but then, uh, his name is Radix by

01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:11.140
the way, R-A-T-I-X.

01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:15.940
Um, and then there's other things that you can go on with.

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.460
Like, for example, when you're looking for the clothes, you can choose to steal them

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:26.260
off of a clothesline, or you can go into the house and ask a lady if she has extra clothes

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:32.100
for a woman, you know, and even then it's like, make up a story, tell the truth, or,

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:35.620
you know, you've got all these different, like, yes, no actions.

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:43.860
Um, and then, you know, you build up affinity with the other, uh, party members.

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:51.700
Um, so that, you know, for example, how well you treat them determines how close you are

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.940
with them and it affects the game.

01:34:53.940 --> 01:35:01.300
I mean, we're talking like BioWare levels of, of character interaction in an SNE, in

01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:02.420
a Super Famicom game.

01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.740
So this game was really ahead of its time.

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:08.980
It really, really was.

01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:15.540
Um, and I don't know why it took me so long to finally play it, but I'm, I'm absolutely

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.900
adoring this game.

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.300
It is in the music is so good.

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.020
It's so good.

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:21.540
And it's so pretty.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.740
Look how pretty this game is.

01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:29.620
Well, the podcast listeners can't see it, but you can always look it up or check out

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:30.820
one of Dark Sakura's streams.

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:38.180
Well, and the, the, uh, music for Star Ocean and then the first Departure, uh, remake were

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.420
done by, um, Sakuraba Motoye.

01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:47.620
Um, the music is on an album that was released, uh, November 1st, 1996 by Sony Records called

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.380
Star Ocean Perfect Sound Collection.

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:57.700
Um, and even some of the, the music that was released with it is sort of like a prog rock

01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:58.100
style.

01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:02.580
So I'm kind of down for it and I absolutely want to, um, get it.

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:07.220
In fact, the first Departure remake had a song called Heart that was performed by a music

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.980
group called, um, Asunaro.

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:13.620
And, uh, it played with the opening credits on, on that version.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:20.820
Um, and then there was, uh, a different song on first Departure are called, um, uh, Atarashi

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:29.780
Ippo, which means the first step by, um, Yaichi Keiko, um, of, uh, Shadow of Lathandor.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:39.540
Um, at any rate, the game sold, uh, approximately 235,000 copies in Japan, um, which is just

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:44.980
over, uh, the 175,000 copies that were just sold in 1996.

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:52.660
Um, it was considered one of the best looking Super Nintendo games ever made in that it,

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:55.380
it still holds up today, which I agree it does hold up.

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:00.100
Um, Famitsu gave the game a 31 out of 40.

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:08.260
Um, uh, for game rankings, it, uh, on the SNES one had, uh, a 93% PSP at 77%.

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:16.020
Um, yeah, the English version really just got kind of good, but not great reviews.

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:23.140
Um, but it was considered one of the best remakes of a Squenix game ever.

01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:25.460
Of course, it was released under Squenix at that time.

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:34.980
Um, but it's, the game itself is so solid and it's, I, I've had so much fun with it

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:37.780
just in the three hours that I've played it, that I,

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.900
I'm looking forward to playing it every, every week for you guys.

01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:43.460
So that, that's it.

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:47.460
It's, it's Star Ocean published by Enix, created by Tri-Ace.

01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:49.700
All right.

01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:50.500
Great pick.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.940
Uh, one that I need to, I, I think I've barely touched this game.

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.900
So this is one I feel like I need to revisit too, but that's it.

01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:59.780
Star Ocean, the classic game of the week.

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:00.900
Great pick.

01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:02.580
All right.

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:04.340
And like I said, super fun.

01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:04.740
Yeah.

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:08.180
And a very long game too, if this let's play is any indication.

01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:09.540
It's like 24 parts.

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.180
So yeah, it's going to put some hours into that.

01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:17.220
It's, it's a lot more dynamic and complex than I thought it was going in.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:17.720
Yeah.

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:19.940
So I'm already engaged with it.

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:20.440
Nice.

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:25.140
Some comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:28.420
Uh, Mishkin says, I still need to get Star Ocean R.

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:32.980
Mike Deff says, I still remember the twist in SO3 with the eyes emoji.

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:34.660
Not going to say what it is right now.

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:38.900
Uh, Questbuster says, one of the things I appreciated about Tri-Ace was how fun their

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.820
combat systems were in their games, like their Star Ocean games to Valkyrie profile.

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:45.060
All right.

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:50.580
Let's, uh, cover some other headlines, uh, rapidly and some rapid fire news.

01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:51.080
Loki.

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:52.340
Yeah.

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:58.580
So apparently, uh, Bruce Stanley, uh, former Naughty Dog employee is unhappy that he is

01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:03.300
not credited in the new HBO show for the last of us.

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:08.340
Since he was the game director behind the game on PlayStation three.

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:10.740
Um, he was also credited though.

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:16.660
Like they had a whole special, um, thanks for him in the last of us part one remake.

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:19.140
Um, but no mention of him on the show.

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:22.660
He did leave Naughty Dog in 2017 though.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:26.100
Um, but it feels, you know, he should have been credited.

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:27.540
Probably should have been credited.

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.060
I heard the show is really good though.

01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:33.460
I mean, I guess I shouldn't remind people it's on Sunday nights or whatever.

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:34.260
It's all on demand.

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:34.420
Now.

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:36.740
Most people are watching on demand whenever you want.

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:37.060
Yeah.

01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:39.620
Um, but I mean, I've heard it's really good.

01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:40.980
So yeah.

01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:41.480
Yeah.

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:45.220
Uh, more game announcements for PlayStation VR two.

01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:50.340
Um, these are going to be some updates for already existing games, including rez.

01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:56.100
Infinite is going to be coming, um, on February 22nd.

01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.140
That's pretty awesome.

01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:05.380
Um, and then I saw something about, um, now I don't know, like, if it's necessarily like

01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:09.060
going to be a really cool feature or not because they have all the eye tracking stuff, but

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:14.020
for Tetris effect though, I saw that you can actually use your eyes to control when you

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:17.860
go into that focus mode or whatever, which I thought was kind of interesting.

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:21.860
Like if you blink for like two seconds or something like that, it's supposed to like

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:25.380
trigger it or something neat.

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.260
Sounds gimmicky to me, but cool.

01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:28.760
Yeah.

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:29.640
Yeah.

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:33.060
Um, so yeah, that's going to be, uh, ported over.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:38.180
And I think if you had the original that, yeah, players who own the original PlayStation

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.500
four additional be able to upgrade it for, uh, $10.

01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:44.180
Oh, they're not even giving it to you.

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.140
No, Sony got to have that money.

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:52.420
Money on, uh, uh, this is, this is, this is why I said what I said a couple of weeks ago.

01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:57.060
I don't think the VR two is set up for success, but you know, and I look, I love rez.

01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.100
I love Tetris effect.

01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.060
They're great games.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.820
We already played them.

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:04.580
Like these are not, these are not tent pole titles that are going to move hundreds of

01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.180
thousands of VR twos.

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:09.380
Well, this is in 4k now at 60 FPS.

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:11.060
I don't remember what the last one was in.

01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:16.580
If that was also 4k at 60 FPS, but, uh, this one's going to be in 4k at 60 FPS.

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:21.300
And, um, they have both five, one and seven, one surround sound audio options.

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.540
Pretty sure that was in the last one though.

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:29.380
Um, yeah, I mean, I don't like to see that, but.

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:32.500
Uh, we'll, we'll see how it goes.

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.940
Um, some comments from chat.

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.860
Bobby Black Wolf says these are the indie devs that are having you pay for the upgrade.

01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:40.580
GT seven is a free upgrade to PSVR too.

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:42.580
I wouldn't necessarily blame Sony for it.

01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:47.460
I just, you know, again, I'm not exactly in a rush to get a VR too.

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:50.580
And again, I love those games, but I can play them on hardware.

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.060
I already have.

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:57.300
And honestly, neither one of those games are that I get the Tetris effect is great in VR,

01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:03.220
but it's not, it's not such a colossal step down to play on a, a, a regular traditional

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.340
screen either for me.

01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:05.940
Like it's pretty fun though.

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:06.980
I do like rez.

01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:07.220
It is.

01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:10.740
But again, I think, and also I'm like, okay, look, I love rez.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:13.620
I look, I am a huge music, Gucci stand.

01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.060
I love everything that guy's made.

01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.340
I even love 99 night.

01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:17.540
Well, I liked it a lot.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:18.660
99 nights.

01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:19.140
Okay.

01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:23.620
Like, but I'm just like, rez has been released.

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:29.780
How many times why was rez area X not its own game.

01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:37.860
And considering that the, the, the graphics in rez, like considering what the style of

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:42.740
the graphics in rez are, is really, they're going to be a difference between 10 80 and

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:43.620
4k.

01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:46.580
Like, is it really make that much of a difference?

01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:50.820
Area X might, but it's not, yeah, it's not going to be the end all be all.

01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:50.980
No.

01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:56.340
So, uh, and then, uh, you know, I'm just like, what, what could we get some love for child

01:42:56.340 --> 01:43:00.020
of Eden, which, you know, has kind of been overlooked over the years, uh, you know, which

01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:04.420
was the connect game on three 60, but has never really seen a revival like rez has,

01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:10.180
or just, I just, I don't understand rez area X was very, very clearly the prototype for

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:12.900
a rez part two or some type of SQL to rez.

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:13.380
Where's that?

01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:14.900
That's what they should have released.

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:19.700
That's you want to get my fucking attention, release that for the VR too.

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.980
But I, you know, I understand.

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:24.980
I see the comments in chat rez isn't necessarily exclusive to PlayStation either.

01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:29.940
But if Sony would be willing to toss them a little money to make it exclusive or at

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:32.100
least give it that release window or whatever you want to call it.

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.860
I mean, they're looking to purchase companies.

01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:35.940
Why can't they throw a little money for an exclusive deal?

01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:37.940
I mean, they are already doing it with Spiderman and stuff.

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:42.980
I mean, so I'm gonna, well, Spiderman is also somewhat in-house with Sony, but that's

01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.700
another, that's the licensing thing.

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:46.260
All right.

01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:46.500
All right.

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:47.780
Let's get to dark soccer story.

01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:57.700
So Deadpool himself has come forward saying that there's going to be Deadpool in Marvel's

01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:02.820
midnight sons and I can't get over this adorable witch hat that he's wearing.

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:07.060
It just says, stay tuned for more details.

01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:12.580
We might have more, I think that that's awesome, but I'm absolutely zero

01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.860
surprised that Deadpool is joining the roster.

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:16.360
Yeah.

01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:17.620
That'd be fun.

01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.860
I just got Wolverine though.

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:22.660
Well, not yet, but we ran into him.

01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.160
Yeah.

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.160
All right.

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:29.940
Before I get to my story, let me get to another comment from chat over twitch.tv slash vog

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:30.340
network.

01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:33.220
Mike Def says, you know what Mizuguchi game needs to come back?

01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.220
And that is Meteos.

01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:39.780
Granted that was with Sakurai, but still I loved Meteos.

01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:40.820
I'm going to be honest though.

01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:43.460
Meteos had an Xbox 360 arcade release.

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:46.900
It doesn't work quite as well on controller.

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:50.820
Like it's, it's doable, but there's something about the touch screen and I'm not, I'm not

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:53.300
sure they could do Meteos on a system besides the DS.

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:57.300
I mean, I know the switch has a touch screen, so maybe that they could do something where

01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.300
you could play with controller or on the touch screen.

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:05.060
But I, I feel like, I don't know if Meteos fits into any current system, I guess maybe

01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:05.560
the switch.

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.500
Honestly, I try a mobile version.

01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:10.020
I wouldn't be opposed to it.

01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.540
I think it's a game that could work very well.

01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:12.580
But yeah, I loved Meteos.

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:13.700
That game was so cool.

01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.380
So we'll see.

01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:16.740
Dr.

01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:19.140
Cia says, wasn't that the one that had the E3 demo?

01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:19.700
Yes, it was.

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.580
You could like download.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:25.140
I remember downloading the demo from the wifi station and like keeping it on the DS for

01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:28.340
like two weeks until it accidentally ran out of battery or something like that.

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:28.980
It was pretty rad.

01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:30.040
Yeah.

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:31.300
All right.

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:31.780
Let's see.

01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:32.900
I have a quick story too.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.940
And that has to do with, uh, Quirtle.

01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.780
Jason was referring to this a little bit in the intro tonight, but you know, there's all

01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:42.020
these Wordle clones, right?

01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:45.140
So some of them have you do multiple words at once.

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:48.900
I guess I think Jason name checked one that was like 32 words at once.

01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:52.580
Quirtle, I think was one of the first of these because it was four words at once.

01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:58.420
Well, as we know, Wordle ended up getting acquired by the New York Times sometime ago.

01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:02.980
Quirtle has now found a new owner and it's not the New York Times.

01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:04.340
It's Merriam Webster.

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:05.620
Yeah.

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.220
Like the dictionary.

01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:13.940
So if you actually go to Quirtle.com, which is Q U O R D L E.com, it actually goes to

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.220
a, it's a redirect.

01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:19.380
Basically redirects you to Merriam Webster.com slash games slash Quirtle.

01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:21.140
So kind of interesting, huh?

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.620
So, uh, the creator Freddie Meyer sent in a message on the games help tab.

01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.660
I'm delighted to announce that Quirtle was acquired by Merriam Webster.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:30.740
I can't think of a better home for this game.

01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:32.500
Lots of new features and fun to come.

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:33.780
So stay tuned.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:36.020
So interesting.

01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:40.180
Nine guesses or fewer to find out four five letter words at once.

01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:43.300
It's like playing Wordle, uh, four times all at once.

01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:45.300
But it's, I like the multi-word ones.

01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.420
It's kind of fun.

01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:52.500
So, uh, Bobby Blackwell says I play Setacortle, uh, which is 16 words at once and 21 tries.

01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:54.100
That that's the most I've done.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.620
The most words I've done was in that one.

01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:01.540
Uh, Digirama S, uh, referring to last story says, what's the other puzzle game that came

01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:02.980
out for PSP?

01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:07.140
I think it was also by Q entertainment, every extend extra.

01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:09.220
And then there was the Xbox 360 title.

01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:11.380
Every step extend extra extreme.

01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:14.580
Uh, and those, those games were a lot of fun as well.

01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:15.080
Yeah.

01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:20.500
I like, uh, God, I had one game of every extend extra extreme going for like over an hour

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:20.740
once.

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.900
I mean, it's not a particularly difficult game, but yeah.

01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:30.100
SS2100 Matt on the Wordle topic says thoughts on the game show Lingo with RuPaul.

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.540
Haven't seen it.

01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:32.260
I didn't realize it.

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:34.260
I knew it was coming, but did it debut yet?

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:35.540
I didn't know it debuted yet.

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:37.380
Yes.

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:43.300
Lingo is a reboot, but I will say, um, uh, RuPaul is a huge step up from the former host

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.300
on the game show network, which was Chuck Woolery.

01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:48.260
Uh, and then, um, I'm not sure.

01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:51.140
I think the original version goes all the way back to maybe the seventies.

01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:55.460
I don't remember who hosted the original original ego, but, um, game show network had a revival

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:56.900
in the, um, nineties.

01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:57.140
Okay.

01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:58.100
It's on Paramount plus.

01:47:58.900 --> 01:47:59.940
Makes sense.

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.580
I'm curious.

01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:01.380
I'll check it out.

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:07.140
Um, I, I like seeing RuPaul do things that are not just drag race.

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:11.940
So, um, I think a game show host is a great place for RuPaul to be.

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:13.380
So, uh, I'll check it out.

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:13.620
Yeah.

01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:14.900
All right.

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:18.580
Let's talk about some things you can check out a little sooner as we travel around the

01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:19.940
world and check out some release dates.

01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:21.140
How about in the U S Loki?

01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:26.580
Oh, this week we have four spoken on PC and PlayStation five.

01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:32.900
Um, hyper dimension, Neptunia sister versus sisters are sisters versus sisters.

01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:40.020
That's on PC PlayStation four and PlayStation five, uh, risen on Nintendo switch PlayStation

01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.940
four and Xbox one.

01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:52.260
Disgaea seven on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five pizza tower on PC

01:48:53.140 --> 01:49:00.420
story of seasons, a wonderful life on Nintendo switch, summertime rendering another horizon

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:02.740
on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:08.820
Uh, we've got wonder boy anniversary collection on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation

01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:17.620

01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.220
series.

01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:26.340
That's it.

01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:27.220
All right.

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.660
Traveling to Japan, a lot of us similar stuff as well.

01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:34.580
I'm sure Disgaea seven on the switch is going to be a very big release this week.

01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:37.060
Uh, it sounds like around the world cause we're getting it in the U S too, but it's

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:38.900
also on Japan this week on the switch.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:43.780
Also summertime rendering another horizon out in Japan this week on the switch story

01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:45.460
of seasons, a wonderful life.

01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:47.540
I didn't chronicle rising.

01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:49.940
Please note that is not the full I had in Chronicles game.

01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:54.100
This is another one of those like prequel games or whatever the, the games that lead

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:55.300
up to I had in Chronicles.

01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:58.180
I'm not sure what type of game this is.

01:49:58.180 --> 01:49:59.780
I was trying to guess from the screenshots.

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.540
If it's like an RPG as well, if it's more like action oriented, it looks like it might

01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:05.860
be a little more action, uh, in this.

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:07.780
So that is out in Japan this week.

01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:10.100
Is this the one we are actually, did we already have this here?

01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:11.060
I think we did.

01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:12.740
Was this out on Xbox here?

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.180
Now someone in shadow, I eat in Chronicle rising.

01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:18.740
I don't know.

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:19.620
Thank you.

01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:22.580
Rama says it's a 2d side scroller action RPG.

01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:23.540
It's on game pass.

01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:23.700
Okay.

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.100
Thank you.

01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:25.780
So it's out on the switch in Japan.

01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.660
So it just, sometimes things are a little delayed while they get localized.

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:28.900
All right.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:29.860
So it's not a different one.

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.860
It's the same one we already had here a few months ago.

01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:32.360
Got it.

01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:38.180
Summertime rendering another horizon also out of the switch Haru kiss in a regular and

01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:43.380
limited edition and Dora think the thrilling brain adventures of Nobita.

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:43.780
That's right.

01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:45.060
That is also out this week.

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:46.100
And that is a Dora mon.

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:47.700
That is a, another Dora mon game.

01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:51.860
I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like a education game cause it's called think, um,

01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:55.780
maybe, but it looks cute, especially if you like Dora mom.

01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:57.940
Uh, let's look at the PlayStation five real quick.

01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:02.340
A lot of the same stuff such as Disgaea seven summertime rendering another horizon.

01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:04.260
I eat in Chronicle rising store.

01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:04.820
I'm sorry.

01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:05.860
I'm looking at the wrong list.

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.220
How did that happen?

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:08.980
Let's try that again.

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:15.540
Uh, in Japan, we do have I eat in Chronicle rising, uh, and go simulator three Disgaea

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.020
seven is out on the PlayStation five this week.

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:23.300
Uh, the Witcher three wild hunt, the multi-language, uh, souped up edition that is out as well.

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:30.180
And for spoken on the 24th, a little bit early, but I'm sure that is because that looks like

01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:33.140
that's going to be a worldwide release, uh, this week.

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:34.740
This is a pretty big week for games.

01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:36.420
What's Europe look like?

01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:36.980
Dark soccer.

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:42.580
Like my unmute button.

01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:47.220
Um, not, not, not really super huge.

01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:54.740
Um, what we have is on the 24th, we have four spoken for PlayStation risen for PlayStation

01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:59.380
and switch PlayStation has world war Z aftermath.

01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:01.860
26,000 odd ballers on switch.

01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:07.780
Also the Witcher three wild hunt for PlayStation and X-Box dead space in the 27th.

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:10.820
And that's what came up.

01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:13.300
All right.

01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:14.900
Pretty, pretty big week for games.

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:17.780
Good way to, um, you know, kick off the year since we're still in January.

01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:19.220
I can still say we're kicking off the year.

01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:24.660
Uh, let's do a few more stories and then we'll get to your comments and calls and all that

01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.820
good stuff in our listener round table.

01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:28.180
But first Loki.

01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:29.540
Yeah.

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:35.300
So the question is what happens to all of those stadia exclusive games that were out

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:35.540
there?

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.660
Well, we have an answer at least for one of those.

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:44.420
So there's a game called gun sport, which was, I guess, a 2d, uh, volleyball type game

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:45.300
that was a stadium.

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:47.140
So when I think of volleyball, I think of guns.

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:49.940
Well, it's the sci-fi volleyball game.

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:56.740
So, uh, by Necrosoft and they then later on ended up releasing at least last year, a

01:52:56.900 --> 01:53:01.860
sequel, which is hyper gun sport, and that's been available on multiple platforms, but

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:03.220
one of those being steam.

01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:11.140
So what they've decided to do since a CD is shutting down, they made their, um, exclusive

01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:12.340
game gun sport.

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:17.220
They allowed you to actually be able to play it through hyper gun sports.

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:23.220
So if you access the beta channel through hyper gun sport, you will have a, you'll be

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:29.300
able to access a version of gun sport, um, an offline version that is being made available

01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.180
through that.

01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:31.780
So that's cool that you'll be able to do that.

01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:36.020
And they said it's because of, um, they care about game preservation.

01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:38.660
So they went ahead and made a version of that available.

01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:40.980
Pretty cool.

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:41.480
Nice.

01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:47.140
Actually, that does remind me to ask our resident, um, stadia power user, uh, dark

01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:52.020
Sakura, how, who just made the biggest wamp face.

01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:55.140
How was the final day of stadia?

01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:56.180
How was the final day?

01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:57.780
I decided not to play.

01:53:58.820 --> 01:53:59.320
Really?

01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:01.220
I made my break already.

01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:03.860
I wasn't going to watch the ship sink.

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.300
That was the night I was playing with you.

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:05.700
Wasn't it?

01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.380
Was the last, uh, yeah.

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:12.580
Cause I, I said something like, it was, that was the day before the last, but at the same

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:16.740
time, I was just like, you know, I, I can't, I don't.

01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.740
I, I made my break.

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:23.860
And on top of that, I didn't want to play any dead by daylight and get like something

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:26.340
that would have been an achievement just to have to do it again.

01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:27.460
That would have been a little salt.

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:27.960
Yeah.

01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:32.900
So I was just like, you know, I, I made my break.

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:33.620
I'm done.

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.180
I'm good.

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:34.500
Okay.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:34.900
Fair.

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:35.620
Fair.

01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:40.660
You know, I saw, but my stream title was RIP stadia.

01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:41.160
Okay.

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:41.980
Yeah.

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.800
Um, I do, since I know you're on G force now, now, cause I know you tried, what was it?

01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:49.000
Bloober or whatever.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:49.500
Boostroid.

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:53.480
Bloober is a team that makes video games like silent hill 2 remakes.

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:56.280
Um, boostroid over, uh, was overseas.

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.440
So I know you were having some lag trouble with that.

01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.200
So you, you kind of are on G force.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.080
Now I saw an interesting headline about that though.

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:08.280
That, um, I don't know if it was bungee or somebody was helping out destiny two players

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:15.560
on stadia with like a free month of G force to try to transition them over to that platform.

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.880
So this could be Google's loss.

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:19.720
Could be Nvidia's gain at the end of the day.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.000
It seems like it could be interesting.

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:26.280
Especially if, you know, if this droid has, you know, doesn't up their game and get ready

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:32.920
for, you know, an overseas, uh, group, then they're going to be SOL.

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:33.420
Yeah.

01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:39.100
I'm kind of surprised that, that bungee didn't go to Microsoft with this.

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:42.140
Cause we know Xbox has a cloud and they can play destiny too.

01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:46.460
So it was just, I was a little surprised that they didn't go there, but maybe Nvidia was

01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:51.420
really eager to cut the deal because I'm sure when Nvidia saw that stadia was going to help

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:54.860
held, there's probably a lot of people like you, Jamie, that are now checking out Nvidia.

01:55:54.860 --> 01:56:02.300
So Nvidia seeing dollar signs where, uh, stadia, you know, has, has left our world.

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:03.500
So interesting.

01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:07.500
All right.

01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:11.500
Zen monkey 11 and chat says offline version I'm sold.

01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:11.740
Yeah.

01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:16.380
That is nice for the, um, you know, exclusive games to get, you know, I'm, I imagine those

01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:19.820
exclusive agreements are now Nolan void with the sunsetting of stadia.

01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:23.740
So I'm kind of glad that they, uh, well, maybe they're not, maybe that's why they had to

01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:26.940
kind of do this a tricky way and embed it within an existing game.

01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:32.060
Maybe they wanted to steer clear of any potential, uh, legal issues there.

01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:33.180
Hmm.

01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:33.580
Anyway.

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:34.540
All right.

01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:36.300
Uh, moving on dark Sakura.

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:41.180
Me whale.

01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:52.700
Um, there is, uh, some, uh, information about, uh, suicide squad game, uh, coming out where

01:56:52.700 --> 01:57:02.700
they're saying that there is going to be, um, some, uh, a battle pass to, for cosmetics

01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.260
and whatnot.

01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:08.620
Um, not a lot of information about it, but the currencies that were shown in the leaked

01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:14.380
image are experience that's used to power up and customize your skill trees.

01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:17.100
So they're all unique for each player.

01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:24.940
Um, VGC was told that you start off really good and can get ridiculous.

01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:29.660
So it's, uh, it's open world.

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:32.460
It's just, the game is suicide squad, kill the justice league, by the way.

01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:37.340
Um, and it's from the people that did the Arkham asylum series.

01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:39.180
So I don't know.

01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:39.740
It looks fun.

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:46.220
I don't, I mean, I guess battle pass stuff is okay.

01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:50.620
I'm kind of already doing it, uh, fifth dream and chat with an ominous prediction though,

01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.420
saying, Oh, Avengers again, we saw where that went.

01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:58.620
So, Hmm, hopefully they play this a little smarter.

01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:01.900
Second player games don't need a battle pass.

01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:06.300
Saying, all right.

01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:08.380
I'm moving on Loki.

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.100
How about another game with a battle pass?

01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:13.980
At least this is an online game.

01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:15.100
At least it's free to play now.

01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:15.820
It's free to play now.

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:17.100
It's free to play.

01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:17.820
So yes.

01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:27.900
Um, some of the pro overwatch teams are apparently look seeking legal, um, help to sue, um,

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:33.180
Activision blizzard over the losses that they're making from, um, you know, not being able

01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:35.180
to participate in these overwatch leagues.

01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:41.580
So, uh, apparently there's a majority of the Overwatch league, uh, league teams are working

01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:46.620
with a British law firm for a collective bargaining process against the event organizers

01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:52.860
after years of high operating costs and continually missing promises on a rep of news.

01:58:52.860 --> 01:59:02.140
So, um, they're saying that they're seeking, uh, somewhere between 7.5 and 10 million in

01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:03.500
franchise payouts.

01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:08.380
So that's a lot of money.

01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:13.260
I guess we'll have to wait and see if they actually, um, end up suing or not.

01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:15.420
I'm sure there'll be big news if they end up doing that.

01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:16.380
Yeah, that would be huge.

01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:20.220
But I just over Overwatch league, like doesn't have a broadcast partner right now.

01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:25.180
And you know, this is the time when like this, the fire is supposed to be hot with overwatch

01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:26.460
with overwatch two and everything.

01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:32.380
It's just like, this is, you know, a lot of people really invested a lot to make overwatch

01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:33.100
league happen.

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:37.740
So it's, um, this is, this could, I don't know, this doesn't bode well.

01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:40.380
I hope, uh, I hope Activision is able to figure this out.

01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:42.300
Yeah.

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:42.540
Yeah.

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.140
It's not bode well.

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:48.220
Phil of nine and chat says, overwatch might just be over.

01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:53.260
Well, I mean, the overwatch league, uh, which would be hugely detrimental to the industry.

01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:57.500
There's a lot of people involved in the overwatch league, a lot, you know, it's like a sports

01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:57.660
league.

01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:01.660
It's an entire sports league going under if that I'm not, you know, maybe I'm, I don't

02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.460
mean to be too, uh, you know, I don't know.

02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:07.580
I mean, I don't mean to blow up the issue too much, but it's, it is an issue.

02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:11.580
You know, to, to the longevity of the, the, the league.

02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:14.700
I think the game itself is fine.

02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:18.540
I think enough people are playing it, but you know, I'm also not Activision Blizzard.

02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:24.060
So anyway, last story for tonight.

02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:29.420
This one is, uh, interesting, but it's, uh, talks about a little bit of a Popeye crossover

02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:30.380
in donkey Kong.

02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:36.460
It's not quite what you think, but it's a little piece of Nintendo history because apparently

02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:41.180
in the original design documents for the donkey Kong game, when we can actually see

02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:46.860
what some of those look like this week, we actually see Popeye in some of the design

02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:48.220
documents for this.

02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:53.980
So, um, uh, Nintendo was going to use the Popeye license for basically what ended up

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:59.900
being donkey Kong because donkey Kong would have been a Bluto, uh, jump man or Mario would

02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:02.300
have been Popeye, you know, and so forth.

02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:07.260
Uh, and olive oil instead of Pauline, you know where I'm going with this, but then obviously

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:08.940
it all became donkey Kong.

02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:13.580
So even though, you know, uh, they didn't get to use Popeye for this.

02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:17.820
This is weird though, because Nintendo did end up making a Popeye game, but I think they

02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:23.260
were, maybe they got the license later or something, or maybe because of the success

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:27.420
of donkey Congress, I distinctly remember there being a Nintendo, at least in the arcades

02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:32.700
anyway, published game that I think then trickled down to all the home systems.

02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:35.900
Cause I know I had it on Commodore 64 and it was on Atari version.

02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.820
It was an early Nintendo release too.

02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:42.220
So it might've been the success of donkey Kong that led to this, but yeah, originally,

02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:46.860
if you didn't know donkey Kong was designed with Popeye in mind and these design documents

02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:47.360
prove it.

02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:53.340
So that's all just a cute little, isn't that interesting sort of thing and piece of gaming

02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.780
history in that.

02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:56.700
So there you go.

02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:58.540
All right.

02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:04.940
DJ Rama S says the Popeye game was a port that they published, but they did the arcade

02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:05.900
version, didn't they?

02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:13.100
I thought that was now I have to look it up because this is going to bother me if I don't.

02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:13.820
Yeah.

02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:17.580
Popeye was 1982 platform game developed and released by Nintendo.

02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:23.580
And then the game was licensed by Atari for the UK and Ireland and Nintendo ported it

02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:27.420
to the Famicom while Parker brothers did all the others and Parker brothers was huge

02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:30.860
in video games and importing everything back in the day.

02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:34.060
So yeah, that was an, it was by Nintendo R and D one.

02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:38.220
So Miyamoto actually was part of the design for this.

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:43.660
The Popeye characters were originally slated for donkey Kong, but Nintendo was unable to

02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:45.020
license the characters at the time.

02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:47.340
So basically it was no, you're fine, Rama.

02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:50.220
I'm glad we're doing a research and getting this all together.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:54.460
So I guess you could say because of the success of donkey Kong, or maybe just a timing thing,

02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:58.140
they were able to get Popeye and do a different game with that, which was fine.

02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:00.380
I thought the Popeye game was fine for its day.

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.540
You know, the different types of levels.

02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:08.700
They're actually, there's a, there's a lot of interesting parallels to donkey Kong actually

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:11.260
in the early Popeye games.

02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.420
So pretty neat.

02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:14.540
All right.

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:16.780
Let's go to the list around table.

02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:21.420
We invite your feedback every week on the show via our mailbag, uh, through discord.

02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:25.820
If you want to join our green room over at, uh, vog network.com slash discord.

02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:29.340
And of course our chat room, if you have any random questions you'd like to ask us in chat,

02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:33.180
cause we haven't had enough tangents tonight, twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:36.620
I don't think I saw emails, but let me check with dark Sakura.

02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:37.580
I didn't think so.

02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:41.340
If you want to change this very disturbing trend, I don't think we've had an email in

02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:42.140
like six weeks.

02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:43.820
We'll just blame the holidays.

02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:48.860
Participate at orange launch radio.com is the place to send an email if you would like.

02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:54.460
So, uh, while I wait and see if anybody in chat wants to ask a question or join us on

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:57.500
discord, let me hop over to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:03:58.060 --> 02:03:59.900
Well, there is something I wanted to talk about.

02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:05.980
It is a brand new DLC coming out for, um, power wash simulator.

02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:12.780
So on the 31st of this month, they're going to have a crossover with tomb Raider and you'll,

02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:15.900
you'll be able to wash the lowercroft mansion.

02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:17.820
It's gonna be huge.

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:18.780
Oh God.

02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:20.300
That's, that's pretty awesome though.

02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.020
I like that.

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:21.520
Yeah.

02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:27.500
I did play a little power wash simulator this week actually, because, uh, I, I played the

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:31.260
one on steam and now I'm playing the Xbox one to get achievements.

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.820
And plus it's kind of like starting over too.

02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:37.340
Cause like now the official releases out and everything, you know, when I was playing it

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:41.580
before it was still in beta, but power wash is still a very fun, just chill.

02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:46.460
I'm just going to wash these rocks type of game.

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:48.000
Yep.

02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:52.220
Finara in chat says, will someone play power wash with me?

02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:54.700
It sounds like I need to do a stream.

02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:55.340
Is it cross?

02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:57.260
I imagine Finara has it on stream.

02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:58.060
Is it cross platform?

02:04:58.060 --> 02:04:58.460
It is.

02:04:58.460 --> 02:04:59.180
It is cross.

02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:01.340
You can do a cross platform mode.

02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:05.340
Um, and then you can also do like, uh, multiplayer.

02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:09.660
I think if you do like campaign, it's only two player co-op, but outside of that, you

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:10.380
can do more than that.

02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:11.420
I think that's maybe eight.

02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:14.780
Maybe we need to do a VOG power washing night.

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:19.020
Maybe times.

02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:19.580
That'd be fun.

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:25.180
Um, Bobby Blackwell says AGDQ did a six player stream.

02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:30.460
I didn't realize it went up to, I thought they did a, um, they did one with, uh, they

02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:32.860
did all the vehicles in the game.

02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:35.020
So that was pretty neat.

02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:36.720
Nice.

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:40.060
All right.

02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:41.260
Anything else to share here?

02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:42.140
Last minute stories.

02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:45.260
Oh, it's all I had.

02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:45.760
That's it.

02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:47.260
All right.

02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:50.780
Well, I think we believe it or not have come to the end of the show.

02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:53.500
So thank you so much for your participation.

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:54.860
I, it was a little, it's weird.

02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:59.180
We're in a, I mean, it's a big release week for games, but, um, you know, not a huge,

02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:00.220
huge story week.

02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:02.860
I think we still have a little ways to go before we start really getting the stories

02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:03.660
rolling in.

02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:07.900
I think a lot of the early parts of this year are probably going to be a ramp up to a lot

02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:09.180
of big releases this summer.

02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:13.900
It's going to be a very interesting summer and a very interesting E3.

02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:20.300
I mean, but I realize E3 is back this year, supposedly, but that whole, you know, summertime

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:21.180
is gonna be very interesting.

02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:22.700
It's gonna be very interesting year this year.

02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:23.980
I'm excited to see what comes of it.

02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:25.340
All right.

02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:27.660
Well, um, that brings us towards the end of another show.

02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:30.700
I want to thank everybody for being here for another episode of orange launch radio.

02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:32.940
Thank you as always for your participation with the show.

02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:37.340
Thank you to the live folks, especially for your generosity tonight.

02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:40.380
As you are listening live, I really, really appreciate all of you.

02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:43.500
Um, I really appreciate all of you that listen on the podcast feed as well.

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.660
I know we have a lot of lurkers who've never said hi.

02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:50.300
I'm going to say hi to you anyway, then to say thank you for being here and listening

02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:50.860
to the show.

02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:53.340
Please feel free to drop us an email and let us know you're out there.

02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:56.140
Um, participate at orange on traded.com.

02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:01.580
You can also send us a tweet if you want at OLR, although I can't really be asked to check

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:05.180
Twitter, but once in a while I'll be like, oh yeah, I should check the OLR Twitter literally

02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:05.980
once every other week.

02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:07.740
I'm like, oh, I guess I should check that.

02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:09.820
So, uh, at some point I'll see your message.

02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:14.380
Uh, and uh, yeah, you can also join us live on a Sunday night, all great ways, but if

02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:18.460
you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two or seven

02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:18.940
about the show.

02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:21.980
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:24.540
need more voices here to put out on air.

02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:29.820
A nice five star review wherever you found this show, like iTunes, Spotify, wherever,

02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:32.940
uh, it all goes a very long way and we appreciate those as well.

02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:38.220
With that all being said, I think we will get to final thoughts, dark Sakura.

02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:42.940
I'm imagining as usual, you will go play some Debbie delight after the show.

02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:45.500
So, um, let me get your final thought first.

02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:52.220
I finally have gotten back to work on my merch store and I will be doing the same for, uh,

02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:53.020
orange lounge.

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:53.900
Yay.

02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:58.220
That'll be great because I'd love to get some merch back out there, uh, for fog too, but

02:07:58.220 --> 02:07:58.460
yeah.

02:07:58.460 --> 02:07:59.500
Or are part of that.

02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.020
And you know what I mean?

02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:02.380
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:03.660
The universe, the universe.

02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:08.220
I'm going to be ordering a sample of some stuff once I get more stuff pulled up and

02:08:08.220 --> 02:08:09.900
let y'all know what it's like.

02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:14.780
But yeah, um, uh, if anyone wants to see what I've done so far, just ask me.

02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:15.820
That was great.

02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:17.100
All right.

02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:18.460
Have a good stream later.

02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:19.580
All right, Loki.

02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:20.460
That means we go to you.

02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:21.580
Your final thought for tonight?

02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:30.300
Uh, I hope this week is better than the last week because work is stressful and I don't

02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:31.180
want to do it anymore.

02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:32.780
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:33.660
Hope it gets better.

02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:38.540
It's just, you know, it's, it's, it's like what we talk about in the gaming industry.

02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:41.420
It's leadership and bad decisions that they make.

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.100
So yeah.

02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:44.300
Let's see.

02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:46.460
And my final thought tonight.

02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:47.500
I'm with Mike Deft.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:51.100
We're at least getting soon to Theatrhythms release in a few weeks.

02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:51.980
That is exciting.

02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:53.100
That is some good news.

02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:54.780
That's some good news to end on tonight.

02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:56.380
So that's, that's the end.

02:08:56.380 --> 02:09:02.060
Just in the, in general, I need to pick up some other games from my backlog and get to

02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:02.860
it already.

02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:07.740
But, um, isn't that always the story, how it goes, but darn that real life for continuously

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.620
getting in the way.

02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:12.220
But I'm always glad as always, if nothing else, we set aside these times on Sunday night

02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:14.060
to hang out and do our thing.

02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:18.460
And, uh, as we have for years and years, and I appreciate all of you for being a part of

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:21.980
it, and we will see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio in seven days.
