1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,660
Cost, savings, and maintenance control are no longer just an appliance and computer thing.

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,780
With the invent and proliferation of renewable energy and more on-peak, off-peak energy plans,

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,540
Xbox is going to allow the user to define when the Xbox should wake up and use more

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,160
power to phone home, gather updates, download and upload data, etc.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,560
The Xbox's green now means just a little bit more.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,280
This is your electrical grid health update, except in Texas.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,520
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,760
gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:47,720
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,200
where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,560
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 944 of our

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,940
show for tonight, January the 15th of 2023.

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:10,240
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,880
Your audio isn't coming through for some reason?

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
That's weird.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
I don't know if it's noise-gating.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Oh, there you are.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Hi.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,360
Yeah, it should be fine.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
I had everything.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,800
I checked it all before.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,960
There's just a weird delay on the noise gate.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
It's all right.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
How are you doing?

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Yeah.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,580
I'm still tired.

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,800
Still tired?

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,000
I actually stayed up all night trying to reset my sleep schedule, and then I took a little

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,220
bit of a nap, some kind of groggy.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,480
Is that because of your subathon?

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,680
No, you weren't up that late with the subathon, right?

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
No.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,960
It's because I've been staying up really late, and I'm going back to work on Saturday.

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Oh, right.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Okay.

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Yes, I'm permitted.

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Yeah.

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:52,560
But yeah, I did 12 and a half hours, which isn't too bad.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,540
I thought I was going to do a bonus killer hour, and I was like, no, no, done.

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Your body's done.

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
And I wore that thing.

43
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,760
I tried to wear that thing, my pig mask.

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,960
It's one of the special cosmetics in Dead by Daylight, where it's the half of a reverse

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,280
bear trap and then a white mask resembling jigsaw for those who are, of course, just

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
listening.

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
But I wore that thing and found out that the hat wouldn't fit over my headphones and that

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,840
the mask was giving me a headache while I was trying to play, so I just said, screw

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
it.

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Yeah, that's a lot.

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Yeah.

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Yeah.

53
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,240
But I had a really fun time, and I'm actually getting ready to publish a video of the best

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
part of the stream.

55
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Oh, fun.

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
All right.

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Yeah.

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Well, let's say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Hello.

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Hi, Loki.

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Hey, how are you doing?

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm doing okay.

63
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Okay.

64
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,640
So I have to ask, you play games behind, well, you're not playing it live, but you're playing

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,540
footage of a game behind you because you can sometimes watch our rooms, our environment

66
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,320
because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG network every

67
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,760
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

68
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
show.

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,680
And as we are taping live, Bob, or not Bobby, Loki has the Smurfs on the Coleco vision,

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
I think, playing behind him.

71
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
That is correct.

72
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Right now.

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Okay.

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,480
I got to know what, why this game this week?

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,120
It's just, it was a game I used to play as a kid.

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Okay.

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,640
I played the one on Atari, but because, you know, that game was like on every platform.

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,520
You know, we've talked about this in previous weeks.

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,040
If you think it's weird that we have like PlayStation and Xbox and switch now, boy,

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:36,280
oh boy, in the eighties, it was, you know, Coleco, Atari, Commodore, Apple, three different

81
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,480
types of Atari's 5200, 7800, 2600, TI 99 4a, like everything, just everything.

82
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,760
So yeah, some games like Smurfs, I think we're on probably most of those platforms.

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,300
So Zen monkey 11 in our chat says jumping on that skull was a pain in the ass for me

84
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,600
as a kid watching some of those old games are really hard.

85
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah, I didn't remember that.

86
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,100
I guess there is different difficulty levels you could select because like I saw and it

87
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,940
will be later in the clip there.

88
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,900
Like there's like a spider and stuff like, I don't remember there being a spider or like

89
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,180
I sort of remember the crow, but I don't know.

90
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,820
So maybe I must have played it on super easy.

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
All right.

92
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
All right.

93
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Yeah.

94
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,300
I mean, it makes sense that you probably were, if you were young, you were probably playing

95
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,440
on the lowest difficulty.

96
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
So fair enough.

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,620
Uh, let's see.

98
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,500
Tiger class says I had a Coleco vision in the form of the Adam computer.

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,060
I remember borrowing a Smurf cartridge from a kid at school to play it.

100
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
Oh yes.

101
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,300
I loved, I loved trading cartridges when I was younger.

102
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,900
Coleco Adam and a Coleco vision.

103
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Nice.

104
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,180
And the Coleco Adam was a piece of shit because of the cassette deck and the power supply.

105
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,100
And if you had a thunderstorm kiss every single cassette that you have near that thing goodbye.

106
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Oh yeah.

107
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,800
I, I don't miss the days of games on cassette tape.

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
That's for sure.

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Cause Commodore had that too.

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,640
It was a, it's so, so it's so weird to think that games were on a cassette tape, but then

111
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,520
again, games were on CD a few years later.

112
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,360
And so it's, it makes sense that a lot of the, uh, you know, entertainment media games

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
followed that too.

114
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Why not?

115
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,960
I think my, my favorite part about this game was the sound when you die.

116
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,660
Cause every time it was just be like, it's playing the, you know, fun Smurf sounds like

117
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,380
their, their theme, I think in the back and then you hit something, it's like smack.

118
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,300
It's just like you instantly fall down.

119
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,700
There's no animation of dying.

120
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,820
It's just smack on the ground.

121
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
That's it.

122
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,420
Like that sound in a Cubert cabinet.

123
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,020
If you can find a Cubert cabinet that still works prime when Cubert falls off the edge

124
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,260
of the cube, it actually has some type of mechanism that makes a very loud, like smack,

125
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,540
like when Cubert hits the ground, there's some mechanism in the cab cabinet that does

126
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
that.

127
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,500
Is it like a loud, loud clack like that?

128
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Something like that.

129
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Yeah.

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,340
It's a little more subtle than that, but it was still funny because I remember.

131
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,420
They used to crack me up all the time, um, myself and my sister and we would purposely

132
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:11,020
just run the Smurfs into something like over and over because it was just ridiculous.

133
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,280
You know, speaking of cassette tapes and classic games, I can actually think of the best use

134
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,660
of a cassette for a video game ever.

135
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,600
And that was the 1980s journey arcade game that actually had the cassette tape that would

136
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
play the song.

137
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,180
I don't remember which their songs it was.

138
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,180
I think it was any way you want it, maybe they would actually play the song when you

139
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,820
actually got to the concert.

140
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,380
Because if you play it now, unlike, I don't know, like the Xbox, it's hard to find that

141
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
game actually.

142
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,780
But even in like MAME probably, unless somebody's emulated the tape at this point, which is

143
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,020
certainly possible.

144
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,880
You just hear blank stuff when you get to that concert level at the end, but it's supposed

145
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,300
to be a cassette tape of them actually playing the song, which is really funny.

146
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,940
So anyway, trip down memory lane, but let's get to a trip down current lane here and talk

147
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,220
about our first story tonight, which has to do with some pretty big changes over on

148
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,220
YouTube.

149
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,900
And look, I don't want people to think just because we're on Twitch, we're picking on

150
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,900
YouTube.

151
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
We are fair.

152
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,180
And when we go back in the archives, folks, when there's Twitch changes we don't like,

153
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,580
we cover those two very thoroughly.

154
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,700
But Loki, I know you're a YouTuber.

155
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,340
There's been a lot of activity on YouTube this week, actually, I want to talk about.

156
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,500
But Loki, tell us about the changes over on YouTube that are not being received too

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
hot.

158
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Right.

159
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,020
So they made a change to kind of their family friendly guidelines.

160
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,940
Basically now you cannot have, you will receive limited monetization or demonetization if

161
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,940
you have swearing within the first 15 seconds of your video.

162
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,980
And same, I think it's even like eight seconds.

163
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,620
There's like different thresholds.

164
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,940
But it's basically the first 15 seconds if you have swearing in it, then they will demonetize

165
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,900
your your video.

166
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,220
Which is really stupid.

167
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,020
For one, here's the more stupid thing, though, that people are really getting upset with

168
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,740
is that, you know, it wasn't always like this.

169
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,660
And they are now retroactively making any video that you've put up, not like from the

170
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,940
time that, you know, we put this change in the place, but all of time, and they're retroactively

171
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,820
demonetizing those videos.

172
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:30,260
So like, how are you supposed to be able to follow these guidelines, if like the guideline

173
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,660
will change in the future, and there's no and there's absolutely no way for you to go

174
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,860
and edit out that content.

175
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,620
Once it's demonetized via this process, it's always going to be demonetized, you'd have

176
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,520
to re upload the video for it to be monetizable again, which is just stupid.

177
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
To begin with.

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,140
Also, they are also going after violent content.

179
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,820
So for example, if you're playing a violent video game, and not everybody's channel is

180
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,820
family friendly, but if you're playing like, you know, a game that has a lot of blood and

181
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,840
gore in it, then you're probably gonna get monetized, which is kind of awful.

182
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:16,680
It's really, really kind of, you know, hitting the platform quite a bit with just your user

183
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
base.

184
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Yeah, exactly.

185
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,920
Because like, if it's really stifling the type of creativity that you can do, I mean,

186
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,120
and honestly, like, if anybody's really serious about YouTube, and looking to monetization,

187
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,560
you know, that like, YouTube monetization is a massive, like, problem is just because

188
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,200
it's hit or miss with everything and all that.

189
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
And you're better off like doing like a Patreon or something like that, where people support

190
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,200
your channel outside of the YouTube space, because it's just, it's very unreliable, especially

191
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,720
when they make changes like this, where it's literally affecting old content that was okay

192
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,840
to put out there.

193
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,800
So one of the like, one of the folks that I watch RT gaming, he was having some issues

194
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,140
where it was there was a video that he put out, it was kind of a recap of 2022.

195
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,080
That was getting demonetized and an age restricted as well on top of it.

196
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,140
And he's like, Why?

197
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,540
Because all of the videos that were contained within it, were not demonetized or age restricted.

198
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,840
So why is this being age restricted when it's a culmination of all my videos?

199
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,220
So YouTube, so he reached out to YouTube to have that fixed.

200
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
And so what did they do?

201
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,460
They were like, Oh, we're going to age restrict and demonetize those other videos instead.

202
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,460
God, it's like,

203
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
what is it?

204
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Is it violent content?

205
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,940
Or what what is it that is possibly triggering the algorithm?

206
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,320
Because that's my big thing is I'm like, YouTube relies way too much on algorithms and the

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,220
algorithms never side with the content creators.

208
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,420
It's really not great.

209
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,100
I don't think it was anything like super, like, I think it was just some gameplay.

210
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
That was causing it.

211
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,300
But it's also like other videos that have been like if they're saying if you swear too

212
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,660
much in your videos that they could also demonetize you because it's it's a lot of like bad language.

213
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,580
But there's a lot of videos where folks aren't doing that and or they're like family channels

214
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,120
are being hit with this and being taken down where it's like, but we're not doing that.

215
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
So why?

216
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
It's a good thing.

217
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,700
We were watching those old orange sounds radio episodes that are up on YouTube.

218
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,200
We were never monetized in the first place because

219
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,300
Yeah, exactly.

220
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,380
So it's like the whole partner program nonsense stuff, which is

221
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:46,320
Oh, I think we might have lost Loki's internet hiccup for a minute because his video froze

222
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
there.

223
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,840
So he'll probably catch up in a minute while his internet catches up.

224
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,220
Let me get some comments in our chat.

225
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,220
So we have DJ Rama S says, with the available tools on YouTube, they should have given the

226
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,920
content creators time to make the mandatory edits for retroactive videos instead of just

227
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,880
straight to monetizing them.

228
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,320
Yeah, there should have been some warning right for sure.

229
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,720
And then we have let's see, Bobby and chat says it's inconsistent pro ZD did a video

230
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,320
on this and didn't swear in the first 15 seconds, but then said, fuck YouTube a lot for the

231
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,060
next minute and he got demonetized.

232
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,360
So yes, exactly.

233
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Yeah.

234
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh, you're back.

235
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Yeah, it's weird.

236
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,880
It just like locked up.

237
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,020
It's still kind of locked up.

238
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
Like no, thank you.

239
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,740
You may have to turn it off and then on again, but go ahead and finish your thought and I

240
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,860
can do some other chat comments here.

241
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
Yeah.

242
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,020
So it's just, it's really a, so yeah, I don't know if you heard about the thing I was saying,

243
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,900
but the change of their terms of service where they can go back now and retroactively take

244
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,520
money back from you if they find that your content is, is not monetizable.

245
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,860
So that it's, that's in their terms of service that was pointed out by gosh, I don't remember

246
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
the guy's name.

247
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Right.

248
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
The repair advocate.

249
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
I don't know.

250
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,480
I don't remember who it was, but anyways, it's a, yeah, you got to read those terms

251
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
of service things.

252
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
It's really bad.

253
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,880
So hopefully this gets straightened out, but it doesn't look like it's going to be.

254
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,160
Somebody had made a joke in chat over it.

255
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,120
Our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network tiger call had said, if this podcast

256
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,440
was uploaded on the YouTube channel, you would have to bleep out all the cussing.

257
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,640
You know, we used to do that a long time ago.

258
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,500
In fact, Jason, our voiceover guy actually used to do a lot of hard work trying to put

259
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,060
in some like video, cause you know, we didn't do the Twitch thing for many years.

260
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,580
So some of the old episodes around, I don't know, maybe 2015, 2016 are up on YouTube.

261
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,660
And Jason did some manual video editing for those.

262
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,640
The funny thing is they might get hit for too much swearing at me.

263
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,180
It's not monetized anyway, not enough people are watching it there.

264
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,020
It might've got hit for that, but we actually have a 30 second intro to the show.

265
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,760
This would have been the old intro was still an instrumental that would take up the first

266
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,280
30 seconds.

267
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,360
So you know, that's actually a good thing to have a little intro bump because that's

268
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,960
going to prevent you from starting off your video with what the fuck, you know, it's just,

269
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,480
it's going to be very, very different there.

270
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,000
So let's see.

271
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,720
Mike Def says, yeah, I helped Jason with the timestamps too.

272
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Well, that's awesome.

273
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Thank you for doing that.

274
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
I actually had no idea.

275
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,020
But now, you know, we, we like the video to be a perk of being a subscriber over on our

276
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,660
Twitch channel over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where you can, you know, watch us

277
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,340
in the archives anytime during the week, if you want, if you want to see us or just be,

278
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,080
or if you want the free option, be here live Sunday night, even better, because then you

279
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,980
can actually chat along with the show as our folks are doing now.

280
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,940
But yeah, it doesn't, not, not a great look to be changing the rules on these folks, you

281
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,040
know, partway through.

282
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,160
It's a very, very unfortunate for sure.

283
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,200
So let's see, looking for some other comments from chat.

284
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Tiger Claw says Linus Tech Tip did a WAN show, WAN show that was completely uncensored to

285
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,440
test if the stream gets demonetized.

286
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,360
Yeah, I wonder how it handles the live streams.

287
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,760
It'll be interesting.

288
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,440
Yeah, I don't know.

289
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
Oh, we got you back.

290
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Good to see you.

291
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,420
Well, what do you, because Loki, out of the three of us, you're the one making the most

292
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,700
content for YouTube.

293
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,960
I mean, Dark Soccer Nominate may put clips or blips up there, but you're the most invested

294
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,380
in YouTube.

295
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
What are you, what are your feelings?

296
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,260
I mean, but you're also making Minecraft videos, which I think you don't use the F word.

297
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,460
Believe it or not, compared to this show, I get the sense you're making your videos

298
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,020
like you're making them for your kids.

299
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,340
So you kind of keep the language out of it.

300
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,340
So you're not really affected by this, but how do you feel about all this?

301
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,520
Right, I make family friendly content anyways.

302
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,360
How I feel about it is, well, if they're not pushing all these demonetized channels, why

303
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
aren't they pushing mine?

304
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,600
I don't, I don't make that content.

305
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
Can you like push mine, please?

306
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,400
Well, everyone else like struggles with their old content.

307
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,320
And that sucks for them really does it can we can we push mine, please?

308
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,280
Well, actually, actually, I am glad I think in all the times we've plugged your channel,

309
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,940
I don't know if we've ever said it's family friendly.

310
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,760
And I know we have an audience that has kids because we have plenty of people that have

311
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,360
been listening since you know, they were in high school and they now have nine and 10

312
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,620
year old kids.

313
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,320
So it's been a little while.

314
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,840
So they may be interested in Yeah, it's good to know that Loki doesn't swear on the Minecraft.

315
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,720
It's just it's a weird like, the algorithm is weird.

316
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,160
There's no rhyme or reason to it.

317
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,500
And I think it's possible and I don't know it's all because it's all speculative since

318
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,320
we don't know how any of it works.

319
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,640
I think I may be at a detriment because I've had my channel for a long time and I had different

320
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,920
type of content on there years ago, not many time recently, but years ago.

321
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,200
And so it doesn't push it at all.

322
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,800
Whereas I have a fellow cast member on our server that just started putting out like

323
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,320
videos and also like, up to 5000 subscribers just like boom, like super fast.

324
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,260
And that's not a guarantee like if I like went and created a second channel and like,

325
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,460
put content on there, there's no guarantee that that would take off or be more successful

326
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
to backfire.

327
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,000
So it's just, I don't know, you just have to just like grin and take it while everybody

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,260
else just reaps the benefits of making click baby content.

329
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,700
Well, maybe one of these days, you'll get that thing that goes viral.

330
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,060
On that note, the other YouTube thing I wanted to bring up so actually has nothing to do

331
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,320
with any of this, but I don't know, Loki, did you see this?

332
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,440
So you know, our pal yyr, who often, you know, comes in our chat room and is an indie game

333
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
developer, right?

334
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,760
You can check out his games, yyrgames.com, I believe is a website with links to everything.

335
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,440
But a few games that we've talked about here on the show before pixel poops, right?

336
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,760
Because Loki made the unofficial sequel.

337
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,260
Well, no, it is official sequel, actually, pixel poops, number two, he made for the NES.

338
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,360
And then there's been other games like snake 360 bungee ferret tossing, which was born

339
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,420
of this show.

340
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,780
I don't think you can get that anymore, because that was on the Xbox 360.

341
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,420
But you know, someday it'll come back on Steam.

342
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,980
Anyway, my point is, he he did a game years ago, we talked about in the show, I think

343
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,100
that game came out in 2018, super multitasking, which, again, if you've never played this

344
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,100
game, because you're a little newer to orange launch radio, it's like WarioWare, but like

345
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,940
amped the fuck up, meaning you have to play four mini games sometimes at once, it sounds

346
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
easy.

347
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,880
It is not easy, because you're playing one with the buttons, one with the controller,

348
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
one with the bumpers.

349
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,880
So it's it's a challenge.

350
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,520
And I remember when I first played the game, I said, Aaron, this is because that's his

351
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
name.

352
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,280
I said, Aaron, this is like this game has the chance to go super viral and blow up,

353
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,860
you just need the right person to see it.

354
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,920
And it's and sure enough this week.

355
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,280
Now I don't follow a lot of YouTube stuff.

356
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,620
But I do understand the game grumps are pretty well known and have a large following and

357
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,740
so forth.

358
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,620
They played super multitasking this week on one of their videos.

359
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,320
So I'm when I so it was actually Jason, our voiceover guy that texted me and said, uh,

360
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
do you know about this?

361
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
And I was like, what?

362
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,900
I'm like, Oh, my God, no, I'm so happy for why we are I hope it pushed some sales.

363
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,180
I mean, I kind of skipped through the video.

364
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,560
And I didn't hear them mention it by name a lot, which is kind of a bummer.

365
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
But I get it.

366
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,280
Like, it's not really supposed to be an ad for the game.

367
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,240
But I did go to like this.

368
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,980
I went to the steam reviews for the game, and I saw two were written today.

369
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,440
And so that means people are seeing it because of that video.

370
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,260
I don't know if it's blowing up, so to speak, but it's probably getting more downloads than

371
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,240
it has since its launch.

372
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Thanks to that video.

373
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
So that's pretty exciting.

374
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,160
Yeah, Mike Deft says even in the video, one of the grumps thought it was a new game.

375
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,740
Technically, super multitasking is a newer version, the game was originally just multitasking.

376
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,140
So super multitasking has extra stuff in it.

377
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,880
But anyway, congrats to YYR.

378
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,120
When I heard about that, I was like, you know what, I'm even if and the video is the context.

379
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,620
I think the title is something like, I don't want to guarantee ADHD breaks because of this

380
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,620
game.

381
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,260
Yeah, it makes a little play on ADHD.

382
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,700
But my understanding is the gentleman that played it actually has ADHD so he can joke

383
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
about all he wants.

384
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,900
At least they did a hashtag super multitasking.

385
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,540
But yeah, there's no link or at least a mention.

386
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
Yeah.

387
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,580
No, I think the title screen because I was going through it and the title screen came

388
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,100
up because I remember them saying something about it.

389
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,980
I was kind of skipping through the video because this is a long video.

390
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,860
And I don't know the personalities that well.

391
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,820
I just know they're very well liked and a lot of people watch them.

392
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,780
So yeah, I was very happy for Aaron to see that.

393
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,200
So go give that video a like and some comments and all that good stuff and because he deserves

394
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,340
to have that game be very successful.

395
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,780
And Loki, if it gets attention on his back catalog, you still have to benefit from that

396
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
too.

397
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,260
Because if people are like, what are the other games this guy has made the pixel poops.

398
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,760
There was was it there's one I saw I had a notification or I saw it.

399
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:28,120
I don't remember how it is in Twitter where somebody had just posted like that they were

400
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,600
I forget where they're at.

401
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,240
Oh, gosh, it was it was something about like they like I've reached the achievement of

402
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,660
like the ultimate pooper and they had filled the entire screen of one of the levels in

403
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,760
pixel poops number two was slapping so hard over there and they took like a picture of

404
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,920
it like the TV or something they were playing like games on their TV and they did a shout

405
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,140
out like they linked the game they just shout out with that and they also like mentioned

406
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,860
like hey if you bought the buzz before of all the a while back you have this already

407
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:12,280
type thing so that was cool I'm trying to remember where that was at here let's see

408
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:20,720
who said that it was because I put like I'm like I'm so proud when they did that oh it

409
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,480
was this guy a dead-eyed bit who had I guess he was at magfest in playing stuff with a

410
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,160
few people there I don't know who that is right because magfest was the indie guy yeah

411
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:42,260
so he had that it has a few pictures that's kind of cool so yeah so I guess he like

412
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,180
the game and you know he is playing some other like indie games as well indie NES games

413
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:55,780
so I'm glad they got to check it out and play it and yeah so well you know what YYR and

414
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,500
his wife had the baby not too long ago a couple years this way but not too long ago you know

415
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,980
they could use some additional sales of the game so you know and it just it'll motivate

416
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,660
him to get on the back catalog and make even more so I'm really really happy for I will

417
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,100
say this y'all know I'm not a fan of Twitter at this point and I'm gonna very much not

418
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,800
get on my soapbox but when I did hear about this I actually said you know what I'm gonna

419
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,660
peek at Twitter and search for super multitasking and see if it's actually trending sadly I

420
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,660
didn't maybe I did the search wrong I didn't really see anything about it but I maybe I

421
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,380
didn't wait long enough till after that video had been out I don't know so I was kind of

422
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:41,700
curious if maybe it had gotten any traction that way so but yeah so that was another random

423
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,080
YouTube comment but very happy for Aaron so you know he's part of the fam here at OLR

424
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,100
so yeah to see him get some attention all right speaking of attention let's talk about

425
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,700
the games that have been captivating our attention this week and how was your gaming week so

426
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,120
Dark Sakura we'll start with you how was your gaming week okay now I know you're muted on

427
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,400
discord because I see the icon I played a bunch of dead by daylight whoo I played twelve

428
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,920
and a half twelve and a half hours plus six hours a few days before that and I think another

429
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:20,280
six seven hours before that um I got you know got all made up so I did a sub-a-thon honestly

430
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:27,200
I didn't get as many subs as I hoped I would which um because you know I kind of need some

431
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,600
assistance right now um but other than other than that I had so much fun so I want to thank

432
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,740
first of all um Finara who was with me the majority of the day and huh yeah and then

433
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:51,200
Iseko played a couple rounds with me um I got raids from Franglish from uh uh Empire

434
00:24:51,200 --> 00:25:00,880
TV one of my uh friends from uh back south um I got uh uh LC popped in to say hi it was

435
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,920

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,280
mental health or just yeah okay understandable just Debbie being Debbie there's other things

437
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:20,400
I think that that's that's their thing fair enough um but um uh words um I also played

438
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,240
with one of my new friends that I had made literally on Wednesday who was a legion who

439
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,600
killed us all and it turned out that this bill had been following us like breaking hooks

440
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,640
and fast faulting trying to you know be the last person left alive so um we ended up making

441
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,600
friends with with with them and uh they uh started playing with us we swift a few times

442
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,600

448
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,720
um I want to thank everybody who came in to show me support and thanks for thanks for

449
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,760
the uh oh my god Sia Tabiri gave me 10 gift subs so Sia Tabiri wins some artwork from

450
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,660

451
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:44,440

452
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,120
came in and showed me love and the subs were awesome I mean I'm not I'm not poo-pooing

453
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,920
what I got I'm very grateful for it I'm very grateful for it um and it was a little bit

454
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,680
short notice but um but AGDQ was also last week probably had a lot of eyes on that yeah

455
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:08,680
and honestly this is the I think the last week before I go back to work full time so

456
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,880
maybe we'll see at any rate as Gwen has mentioned in chat yeet build yeah when I was lurking

457
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,720
you you you all were starting that I think it was your first game where you all did that

458
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,000
and um but there was one before all that was the one you clipped yeah where I yeeted myself

459
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,540
off the hook in the basement right in front of the killer that was awesome um but anyway

460
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,460
so we all decided that we were going to bring Slippery Meat which gives you an extra four

461
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,900
percent chance to get yourself off the first hook you already have a four percent chance

462
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:50,180
and then we all brought uh jars of Salty Lips which gives you an even greater thing and

463
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,100
it stacks and I brought up the ante just you know to add another layer of goody of course

464
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:03,100
and with that level of uh odds being in our favor I reckon um we were getting ourselves

465
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:10,100
off of every every hook it was fantastic um and but the thing is is that we were really

466
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,260
doing it just because I mean we wanted to to I guess kind of piss people off which we

467
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:21,260
did we made some big angies um but then we got our friend Dr. Bot there are people who

468
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,220
will go out on bots and just basically because survivors will go farm their blood points

469
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,220
on them the bots will you know basically get the blood point for whoever set the bot up

470
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:40,220
um and then um so we got a bot and then we had an AFK Cenobite wasn't that one and then

471
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:48,220
we got the last up Ghostface yeah that was a great I'm glad they put that skin in the

472
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:54,220
game the same um I actually have been spending most of the afternoon editing that video just

473
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,220
for you know some time and and some silliness um because I wanted to compact it into like

474
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,220
the most silly in in one thing um oh my gosh Fifth Dream you're gonna be playing with us

475
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,220
then you're you're gonna have to swiff with us Fifth Dream is playing DBD now um at any

476
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:18,220
rate uh the we had a hell of a time getting the Ghostface to to hook us but finally we

477
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,220
were all just you know there's an animation where you can point and then you can kneel

478
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,220
down and point and so we're all kneeling down and pointing going eat eat eat eat and counting

479
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,220
every time um so that video will be up and I'll be linking it on my Twitter before too

480
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,220
long um that that was the standout game that was the standout game I had so much fun and

481
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,220
I made it to Silver Four in one day wow put it on your Mastodon too so I can see it

482
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:55,220
sure um but at any rate um I also did finally beat Final Fantasy 5 oh nice which means um

483
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:02,220
next Saturday if I don't take a break from the SNES stuff um I will be starting Star

484
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:10,220
Ocean as in the original Star Ocean on Super Famicom oh wow um because that's my goal with

485
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,220
the the retro stuff is to do RPGs that you might not have seen um you know like I did

486
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:24,220
Terranigma I did Seiken Densetsu 3 I did uh well I did Final Fantasy 4 and 6 because I

487
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,220
played uh Japanese translations except for 6 so it didn't work and I played Final Fantasy

488
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:34,220
5 which I freaking love Final Fantasy 5 but I forgot how long the damn X death battle

489
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:42,220
is oh my god um and who names their kid X death anyway um and then um I've been playing

490
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Marvel Midnight Suns um yeah yeah Finara's right Terranigma most disappointing disappointing

491
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,220
ending since Great Expectations I will say it disappointed me the way the mist disappointed

492
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:00,220
me lower those expectations yeah but the whole game is like amazing and then um and then

493
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:06,220
anyway um I've also been playing my wordscapes just you know because I managed to solve a

494
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:12,220
complex puzzle in 10 seconds so I think I need I'm finally able to just like do words

495
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:20,220
in my sleep um uh played some pinball we hosted League um and now it's not me playing it but

496
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,220
I had a hand in this it's my fault blame me for this but I had a hand in this it's my

497
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,220
playing it but I had a hand in this it's my fault blame me for this so to give some backstory

498
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,220
on this uh our friend Nick Nick and Prince um had an advent calendar during the holiday

499
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:44,220
thing where you could you know put in and and win a prize on the advent calendar and I won

500
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:54,220
a bonus stream so me in my my kind and caring disposition I picked Sonic Adventure which

501
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:00,780
of course is Sonic Adventure DX on Steam and even I had forgotten how crappy the camera is in that

502
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:08,380
damn game but Nick seemed to have some fun with it I mean played almost all played up past the

503
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:21,580
egg carrier and there is a chao named Sakura and uh he was enjoying catching otters but yeah it was

504
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:27,340
I had such a good time watching Nick play and he was a really good sport about it so um I actually

505
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,380
do have enough points to to redeem another bonus stream but I'm not because you know I'm trying to

506
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:38,540
be kind about about the backlog but I might do Space Channel 5. Oh that'd be a good one. Yeah

507
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:47,500
so at any rate um I'm gonna I'm gonna say that the the word that sums up my uh my week is yeet!

508
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:55,100
All right uh Loki we'll go to you how was your gaming week? Um I played mostly Minecraft this

509
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:02,300
week still working on stuff um I did play some co-op um power washing sim so that was fun

510
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,780
and we got to do uh three I think it was three players I forgot you can co-op that game now

511
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,620
yeah so we did that stream with that so that that's fun so I messed around that a little bit

512
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:21,020
um yeah I mean that that's kind of it I did find something though so I've been going through

513
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:27,500
like um my sister had a bunch of stuff that my mom had kept for like old like school stuff and

514
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,860
there was something that happened to dig out of there that I thought was pretty funny um so and

515
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:42,220
I don't remember this but I I have a certificate of merit for capturing Carmen San Diego

516
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,660
uh I love it where did you get something like that's funny

517
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:57,740
I apparently make computer lab so that's uh yeah but I guess she kept everything

518
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:06,780
amazing all right um if that's it then my gaming week um still playing on the machines behind me

519
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,780
uh mostly the new Tron machine arcade went up I talked about last week been playing that a little

520
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:17,980
bit um and uh a lot of the usual suspects uh Final Fantasy 14 had a patch this week uh the

521
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:23,260
6.3 patch so there was a new raid which I kind of enjoyed I the mechanics were easier than the last

522
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,500
one uh but I liked the music in the last one a little better but you know I still like the raid

523
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,900
series um Shane kind of made me do it I don't always love to do the new raids the first week

524
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,220
because they're always kind of a white fest and people get mad but actually it was it was fine it

525
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:44,300
was tolerable so um yeah props to that and uh been doing island sanctuary which uh is my favorite

526
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,820
thing in Final Fantasy 14 and they just upped the level cap from 10 to 12 and they released

527
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:56,860
cosmetic gear when you get to level 12 because end game and mmos fuck raids fuck pvp it's all

528
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:03,180
about glamour cosmetics transmog and what you're wearing it's all about the fashion okay and get

529
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,620
this so they added two very important things that rank 12 in island sanctuary number one

530
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,140
an alligator mount which is which is cool that's cute but the more important thing the outfit that

531
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:25,100
you can get is now a swimming speedo outfit and I need that for my viera my my him not a himbo

532
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,140
but a him bunny I need my him bunny to have the speedo outfit so I'm making my way to rank 12

533
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,340
as soon as possible but it's uh it's a bit of a grind so uh working on that reddit's a lot of

534
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,700
help though with what exactly to make and when uh so you're turning you're gonna be turning your

535
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:47,020
island into like what was it the the uh the male gay equivalent of milf island or something like

536
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:53,740
that I wish I unfortunately the the the mechanics aren't that deep you can have like a friend visit

537
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:00,300
your island but the customization is still a little bit limited but I think they sort of see

538
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,300
how much it's catching like I don't think it was supposed to get any update with this recent patch

539
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,460
like they were like oh island sanctuary will get updates and even numbered patches but they did

540
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,860
an update anyway because I think a lot of people are more into it than they originally uh saw so

541
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,820
hopefully the customization options get even better and it's gonna it's gonna be an rp delight

542
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,780
just wait until people are doing their rave parties on the island instead of the personal

543
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,380
housing districts that you know that's what they do right now so there's there is that uh I've

544
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,340
also been playing a little bit of world of warcraft I don't know if I'm gonna renew when

545
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,700
this month's up though I've kind of done everything I'm gonna do in that game but I do there's things

546
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,540
about the mechanics in that game I kind of enjoy so I kind of enjoy kind of having both in the

547
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,260
rotation right now but it's keeping me from playing other games so one gotta go and the

548
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:53,580
reality is I'm always gonna pick 14 over wow right now so there's there's just that um but

549
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:58,780
I've enjoyed this latest expansion the latest expansion I think has the game in a lot better

550
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,340
place and I think it's especially I think the dragon flying mechanic is a great compromise

551
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:09,020
for how to fly in a new area without necessarily like just people flying from point A to point B

552
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,900
all the time um I think they did a good job with this expansion so you know kudos to them

553
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,380
um because I know it's not always been good news over there um so kudos to the teams that worked

554
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:24,700
hard on that um and then uh I played a lot more vampire survivors you know after bringing it up

555
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,500
on last week's episode I was like I need to to jump in and play a little more of that and uh

556
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,900
I for I forgot because I hadn't unlocked it yet but now I do there's a dog character that you can

557
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,940
play as and that by far that playing as the dog is my favorite because the dog starts with this

558
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,980
attack that's these like floral it looks like he's throwing flowers out or a bouquet of flowers

559
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,700
out or something like that but um it's very similar to the garlic attack where it like

560
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,260
pushes monsters away from you it's great so um I uh yeah I'll be playing a lot more as the dog but

561
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,060
the game encourages you to kind of cycle through the different characters so uh yeah thank gosh

562
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,420
for cloud saves between pc and xbox series x because of my controller issues I had to switch

563
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,180
over to playing vampire survivors on series x but um it picked up my old save which is great

564
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,660
there's a ton of achievements everything you can do in vampire survivors is like a five-point

565
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,420
achievement so there's like 140 achievements or something like that in the game it's pretty wild

566
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,420
so I've been having fun unlocking all those that's for sure so uh dark Tetsuya keep at it it's it's

567
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,980
a roguelike like anything else so just remember every because dark Tetsuya said I'm stuck in the

568
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,220
second area I haven't been able to pass it so kind of put vampire survivors back on the shelf

569
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,100
go back to the first area and earn some more coins and buy yourself some power ups some new

570
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,100
characters because that's that's what a roguelike's all about right when you can't get over the hill

571
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,500
try to invest the money to help get you over the hill so um it'll uh it'll get there it's it's it

572
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,580
is difficult at first the game's kind of designed like that but once you once you're able to get

573
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,260
some runs where you really get the money pouring in and you can really kind of buy yourself a

574
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,660
better starting build you're going to be in a great place so uh yeah it'll be fun so um yeah

575
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,460
that's pretty much it for my gaming week nothing really new yet but I am eyeing my backlog on what

576
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,700
can I stream and catch up on because I'm honestly looking at the latest expedition no man's sky and

577
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,900
I'm just kind of like you know I missed an expedition now I think that train derailed

578
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,220
I'll try the new expedition whatever that comes out but I'm looking to stream some other stuff

579
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,260
I have a huge game backlog to catch up on there's things like tunic I still really need to play so

580
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,780
I'll probably do a stream of that in the coming weeks so it just depends on my availability

581
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,300
all right well talking about new games to stream or not stream or otherwise

582
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,980
we're going to get to our top story I do want to mention real quick before we get into headlines

583
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,700
because we usually do uh like housekeeping and show updates um I've mentioned this before we're

584
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:54,700
not going to be here February 26th uh I'm going to be on a cruise that week um the Star Trek

585
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,940
Cruise which I've talked about before get this though so you know I talked about it on the show

586
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:05,180
the other week I was very excited because Kate Mulgrew is coming back this year guess what right

587
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,740
after we went off the air I got the alert she cancelled she had to pull out due to a filming

588
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:20,460
commitment they replaced her with Shatner yay I'm so oh god that sucks Rob I'm sorry I'm so

589
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:29,340
pressed I'm so pressed about it but you know what that's just you know what if when that programming

590
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,140
is going on there it's not like there isn't 500 other things to do on a cruise ship I can go do

591
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,940
something else it's fine and they got they got one of the um voice actors from Prodigy to come

592
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,020
as well which I thought was kind of cool um and they're still like Doug Jones is still going and

593
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,100
that's the the big one I can't wait to meet and get autographed with so it's not it's not all bad

594
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:57,740
news but it's like talk about a fucking downgrade anyway all right uh tiger class says probably to

595
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,900
record another season to start her prodigy well they got one of the other voice people there so

596
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:08,300
I don't know but they I'm sure they all record at different times so who knows all right Fanara says

597
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,100
everyone run to one side of the cruise ship and fling yourself overly dramatically at the railing

598
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,300
when you know who starts fucking reminiscing and talking about the good old days I'm sure

599
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,620
I'll do just that anyway let's move on to other happier topics and Loki as I was mentioning uh

600
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:31,980
new games potentially right yeah so we're going to be getting a um Microsoft um I don't want to

601
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:38,300
call it a direct a oh okay I guess they're calling it developer direct um a developer direct uh

602
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:46,460
featuring Bethesda and Xbox titles um on January 25th it's going to take place at 3 p.m eastern

603
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:53,180
12 p.m pacific and they're going to be focusing on upcoming xbox games like forza motorsports

604
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,260
minecraft legends red fall and as well as new content for elder scrolls online

605
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,140
um probably no mention of starfield because I'm sure I'll be delayed again

606
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:11,660
um yeah so we'll have to wait and see what they show there uh I gotta be honest with like minecraft

607
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:17,900
legends like I was minecraft legends funny enough is pulling an elder scrolls online with me

608
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:27,340
the more I see of it the less interested in it I am so that's it's it's I hope they show something

609
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:32,460
that makes it look interesting please or just mention anything about minecraft because it's

610
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:39,660
been absolutely radio silent since October I bet they will this this is a good time to give an

611
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:48,780
update well you know they said that their next update is going to be focused around story or

612
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:57,260
focused around things that will help you tell your story they put out a trailer today or not

613
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:05,420
today this week showing off the microsoft or the the minecraft store features like as in the

614
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:16,060
content that you can buy through there that will help you tell your story I have reservations about

615
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:25,260
all that so by tell your story you mean give me money meaning the the the next big update is

616
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,020
moving store to java edition so that you guys can pay for things too which no one will because

617
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:36,140
it's the java edition there's so much content out there that we don't need to do that but

618
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:44,220
you know I mean they're gonna try we'll see all right yeah well we'll have to we'll have to check

619
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,220
it out I'm assuming it'll be a deep dive on starfield as well we'll actually get to see a

620
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,700
little more of the gameplay because you know we've we've really not seen a lot of gameplay

621
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:59,580
uh we'll get a deep dive in the delay for starfield I'm sure you think again I think

622
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:04,380
again in an alternate universe we're playing that game right now it came out november 2022

623
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,300
so uh you think it'll get delayed again that's a pretty bold prediction I think it'll be

624
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,780
microsoft I think it's gonna be some first party stuff to come out you know there's some

625
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,380
big rumors out there and I think somebody had just posted it to our discord as well over at

626
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,740
vognetwork.com slash discord big rumors that scale bounds making a comeback scale bound got

627
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:29,740
uncancelled and platinum games working on it so apparently like there was a note it says on here

628
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:36,220
that microsoft has noted that the uh the standalone show for starfield is in the works

629
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,860
um oh interesting one that will dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive

630
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,380
hmm correct in a few months once once the delay is over

631
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,740
for their sake I hope not but at the same time right you want the game to be good so don't

632
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:59,260
release a crap product it's coming out q4 yeah I'm sorry all right we'll see well you know what

633
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,300
it would be interesting if if the microsoft overlords uh finally forced bethesda to put

634
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,260
out a non-buggy product it'll be uh that'll be newsworthy in and of itself to be quite honest

635
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,780
we'll be we'll already be in starships by the time that happens like actual starships actual

636
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:23,260
starships yeah all right jefferson starship uh finara says isn't it par to put out unfinished

637
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,860
stuff these days yes but well that is true the internet will rake over the coals for that

638
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,820
especially when there's early previews of stuff and there have been games that have their sales

639
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,300
that get impacted because you know that first week sales is really important it's like a movie right

640
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:45,260
halo infinite i mean like it there is like they really like microsoft needs to take a page from

641
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:51,660
sony's book and release products that are polished like actually polished and not buggy when they

642
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,860
come out like you know horizon or god of war and all that stuff they need to release like actual

643
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:04,780
quality product that is finished and halo infinite was a bad start i mean obviously so other games i

644
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:10,620
think like forza and stuff have been pretty good but also they kind of had to 180 during development

645
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,500
because of the original feedback so there there is that so we're already yeah i had a bad start there

646
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:21,020
but like i mean but they need to like with a big tentpole title like something like that they

647
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:27,820
really need to focus on making sure that is absolutely perfect they did not do that this time

648
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:34,940
they did quite the opposite but um maybe the next game will be better fable you know or something

649
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,980
like that oh i'd love to see more on fable i hope we get that in this direction i would too i would

650
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,700
be very excited especially considering who's making it you know in their track record i'd love that

651
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,380
so all right well in the meantime let's talk about things that have leaked to the internet

652
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,980
uh an interesting pair of leaks uh that happened this last week the first one had to do with valve

653
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,980
and an asset repository leak so basically what happened with this is that uh content for team

654
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:09,020
fortress 2 that was cut and uh some other things on like the half-life games they all hit uh the

655
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:14,540
web this week uh in a leak and of course the original story i had linked is not working for

656
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,100
me right now but that's okay because i can switcharoo on the fly here uh it also included

657
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,660
stuff from portal and counter strike source but i believe the vast majority of it was cut things

658
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:35,020
from team fortress 2 um and uh so uh there's uh never before seen maps models psds vmfs 61 gigs

659
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:40,540
of content for team fortress 2 this is the last official team fortress 2 content drop anyone will

660
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:46,380
see is uh what's apparently the leaker have been holding on to these two for uh since 2016 at

661
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:53,820
least that's what they're claiming so um there you go so nothing about anything with a three in

662
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:59,020
it so don't get carried away but you know people are kind of looking at like oh here's some stages

663
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,060
and things that were supposed to be in the game that didn't quite make it through and little

664
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:09,500
things like that also very interesting uh mortal kombat 2 had some leaks that you know the source

665
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:16,700
code and this is you remember red red uh radon yeah like this this uh source code leaked uh

666
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,340
of course github got a takedown request for the source code from warner brothers discovery because

667
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,420
of course they did but you know the old saying once it's on the internet it's always on the

668
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,700
internet uh there's also not just source code that leaked but there are assets that also leak to the

669
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,580
internet that show a new johnny cage fatality which i thought was very interesting it looks

670
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:42,140
like he either like rips their face off or rips their brain out uh in this fatality and uh it may

671
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,700
have been a little much even for that i mean you know obviously that's nothing for those games now

672
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:52,780
but maybe in the 90s that game's older than most of the people playing it yeah so uh it's

673
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,980
interesting that the that's uh all been unearthed but otherwise i didn't think a lot of i mean if

674
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:04,140
you are super into the mortal kombat games then like every frame every like move that possibly

675
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,140
got deleted or something is very interesting but i think for the casual fan it's kind of like

676
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:12,300
it's not like there's anything super like there's no like missing characters or anything like that

677
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:18,860
outside of that uh one fatality really some really neat animations though like the spin attack from

678
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:25,020
baraka yeah yeah that thing was pretty cool there was a uh a radon move that looked like

679
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:31,100
his original fatality that looks like it was cut too which is interesting so there were um now i'm

680
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,900
gonna just throw a little backstory in this i was living you know in alabama when this game came out

681
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:41,100
and we took a trip up the east coast um it was the trip i went to new york uh got to play at carnegie

682
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:48,300
hall um but anyway they had a lot of test units like of different builds for mortal kombat 2

683
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:56,300
um so this was like in 93 and um like there were even like early nba jam you know cabinets still

684
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:01,900
out around the time too so some of this stuff like i remember seeing on early units like we

685
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:07,580
still we still found machines that you could do like infinite uh katana loop on and all of that

686
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:13,340
it was it there were just some things like oh i think i saw that or you know it just sort of

687
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,900
hit some of those things for me it was pretty cool yeah so kind of kind of a nice look back

688
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,140
especially considering how old the game is right now i i'm like the source code isn't really

689
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:27,740
hurting anybody but you know whatever i guess warner brothers feels the need to i mean i get

690
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:32,700
it because like you know it is and they're still selling mortal kombat 2 and these arcade one-up

691
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,340
machines for one and there were rumors about those hd remasters some time ago although i don't think

692
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,140
they ever came to fruition i think it got canceled like most things at warner brothers discovery but

693
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:47,340
um you know it's it's it feels like this isn't really hurting anyone but i understand they have

694
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,940
to protect their trademark and all that but it's on the internet now if you want to go find all

695
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,740
this stuff i think that the the discovery of what's been cut is it's not going to hurt anyone

696
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:01,820
now but you know it's interesting that's all anyway dark sakura let's go uh to you for

697
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:08,380
something a little more modern well um i i was actually going to go find it but i put it away

698
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:18,460
somewhere um google is giving us another lovely little handout um as the ship sinks um if you've

699
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,340
got a stadia controller they're going to be unlocking um uh well they're going to release

700
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,260
a tool that will enable bluetooth support on the stadia controller so that you can use it for other

701
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,540
things so not only did you get the controller for a free but it's now bluetooth capable at least it

702
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:43,420
will be um it's it's just pretty pretty happy news you know i think that uh you know rather than

703
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:48,220
having i mean i never was going to consider it a paperweight because honestly i play with

704
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:53,180
a lot of my controllers wired um just because i have a lot of different things that can cause

705
00:51:53,180 --> 00:52:00,780
interference um but i mean i absolutely love that it's a controller that i i've been able to use on

706
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,380
my ipad with little problem um i mean this is this is my regular controller is a steel series

707
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:13,660
and um my stadia controller is just as hefty and feels just as good in my hands so

708
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:19,820
it's a very comfortable controller to use so i'm i'm pretty pretty happy about that um

709
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:29,420
uh i mean we've got two days now until uh until the shutdown no one day i think it's tomorrow

710
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:35,340
isn't it yeah i don't know i'm following so yeah i knew it was coming up real real soon though

711
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:41,580
real soon though oh yeah and i've already gotten of course my my refund in november um

712
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:47,100
bobby blackwolf says wednesday the 18th is the final day okay so dawn of the final day 72 hours

713
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:54,700
remain you know what i might have to do a farewell stadia stream um when i play except i'm trying to

714
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:03,820
do achievements but maybe maybe i'll do a recorded video of me launching into stadia one last time

715
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:13,020
yeah you might as well yeah so at any rate um i i'm still very disappointed especially with

716
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:22,060
the announcement of the uh the chrome book um and i don't i don't know i'm just

717
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,420
hey bobby is mentioning about huh oh no i was just to say hey at least they refunded the money

718
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,780
you know i'll give them a lot of props for that and the fact that they are unlocking the bluetooth

719
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:40,540
on this because um and not everybody may know this but um those controllers they work through wi-fi

720
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:45,260
so the controller didn't connect to your computer connected to your wi-fi so that it could get to

721
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,500
the server faster basically which is you know it's a pretty clever way to do the streaming device

722
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:57,020
yeah i mean it was awesome it was fantastic on my ipad i mean screw dbd mobile you know i was

723
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:03,980
playing the real thing so um but then i was just saying for them to do this they really are doing

724
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,940
something extra and it actually reduces e-waste because a lot of those things would have ended

725
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:16,940
up in the garbage well um to go back to what i was uh gonna say before um bobby mentioned um

726
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:22,620
uh that he's considering getting a stream deck uh and said and might make the stadia controller

727
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,740
my doc steam deck controller um i'm not getting a steam deck yet not until dead by daylight has

728
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:35,820
support on it um and it's the whole anti-cheat thing vhs uses it too and it doesn't like uh

729
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:41,980
any of the unix systems or any arm architecture for that matter and then to answer dj run the s

730
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,500
about a chromebook um yeah so like what was it like a week two weeks after they announced the

731
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:54,140
stadia closure um they announced then that they were making a series of chromebooks geared toward

732
00:54:54,140 --> 00:55:00,700
cloud gaming and i'm like really really google really if you were gonna be giving me all this

733
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:07,580
money back and i'm getting on my dlc and cosmetics and crap for free nah nah brah you don't do that

734
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:14,620
so yeah that was that was the bullshit and you have as far as cloud gaming goes you you have

735
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:20,460
kind of settled on nvidia right now right is now your yeah i did i wanted to like boosteroid but

736
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,180
there's a couple of things about it is that number one the server connection is terrible

737
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:33,580
i don't think they have any u.s servers um i mean it's good for folks who are in uh in europe

738
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:40,220
really good for folks in india because they have uh support for indian servers um but not very good

739
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:46,060
over here and they were being way too slow to get a matt client out um i mean the customer service

740
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,380
were all great people the people that i dealt with and i really wanted to like it but i couldn't swing

741
00:55:50,380 --> 00:56:01,180
it so um i have the the um the regular tier the the 10 bucks a month here for uh g-force and i

742
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:07,260
honestly like it except i hate that it forces you into full screen i hate playing in full screen

743
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:13,660
especially when i i got this big ass monitor so that i could play in windowed mode and have my

744
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:20,780
stream stuff in some place and have this another and it's bullshit however i'm gonna tell all you

745
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:28,380
you know the other five people who play uh games on a mac there's way around it and that's you you

746
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:35,420
get your your window where you want it to be where you you know want to play on it and then when the

747
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:42,460
game goes into full screen wait just a little bit and then do uh control up and that shows you your

748
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:48,780
multiple desktops and full screen windows count as their own desktop so you can go hover to the

749
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:54,700
top of your desktop and then go to the top left hand corner of the nvidia window you get a little

750
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:03,500
double arrow you hit that and it will trick it into being windowed just don't try to move it or

751
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,780
it will not move the way that you want it to do that's what i'm saying get in position first and

752
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:16,700
that is how you get that's how you get around uh it forcing you into full screen hacks now with um

753
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:25,820
with uh boosteroid funny enough in chrome it forced full screen in safari it didn't

754
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:33,260
so i wanted i wanted to like it i really i really wanted to to give the the smaller guys you know

755
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:43,260
a little bit of uh of a joy but alas right um but i mean i really my games look great um the

756
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:49,500
only thing is that because i'm actually in a decreased full screen technically is that it

757
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:55,020
does come up a little pixely um for me just changing aspect ratios like that but for the

758
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:02,620
but for the most part like when i'm in game it's it's beautiful it's smooth um i only get a little

759
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:09,100
bit of lag and and i haven't had a very long wait to get into into my games uh for q like i think

760
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:16,700
the longest ad was six people i'm also playing marvel's midnight suns on it okay and um it's

761
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:23,980
beautiful no problems at all i i i'm enjoying it and the service is far better than i it was

762
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:31,980
the first time i tried it so thumbs up all right well let us move on to uh some less happy news

763
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:39,420
coming out of another company right loki yeah ubisoft has been they've been on a roll with

764
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:46,780
delaying and canceling things so they've again because apparently fans of this game are used to

765
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:51,100
disappointment they have decided to delay skull and bones yet again sorry pirates you're not

766
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:57,260
going to build a pirate until you know later i guess i think the game was announced originally

767
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:06,540
like five years ago like it was a while ago um but yeah so that's been delayed now um also

768
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:12,860
they have announced that they are canceling several other games that i think were maybe even

769
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:21,580
unannounced yet um so and they're saying right now they're the reason is they want to focus on

770
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:27,340
like like super franchises or something like that basically like really powerful franchises

771
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:34,060
i think the problem is that all of their games kind of repeat a certain um

772
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:43,900
pattern i guess uh a certain structure of um you know towers that you climb and uh

773
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:49,020
outposts and every single one kind of has the same type of gameplay and people are getting

774
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:56,060
sick of that and so maybe that's kind of what is causing problems but i don't know

775
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:02,620
i mean that sucks that they're canceling stuff too bad one of those things that they're canceling

776
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:08,060
is not easy come on you know who hasn't addressed any of the sexual harassment

777
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:14,860
charges and uh misogyny that's going on in their company but you know everything else

778
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:22,140
business as usual i guess if i rolled my eyes any harder at him i think i would pull something

779
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,500
uh there was one game though that we can't confirm that was uh cancelled was was the vr

780
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:35,340
splinter cell game but i don't know they've released weirder vr games remember that eagle

781
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:40,620
game that they had i never played that but i bought it but i mean i can say that about

782
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:46,780
hundreds of games i have it is interesting to see them scaling back on a lot of that though um

783
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,820
just not assassin's creed though remember all the three titles that they announced last time

784
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:57,660
yeah gotta go where the money is right uh quest buster in chat says beyond good and evil 2 has

785
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,380
entered the chat uh as an assassin's creed fan myself some of the bloat in the later games was

786
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:07,020
getting a bit much yeah well that's the thing i think they were saying that their next assassin's

787
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:12,540
creed game they wanted to like slim down a little bit as well because yeah it was getting too too

788
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:20,300
big so we'll see i don't know i honestly the last time i was excited about an ubisoft game was

789
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:28,540
far maybe one of the far cries i've been excited about far cry in a long time though so

790
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:36,860
i don't know all right well let's talk about an interesting test feature on xbox uh this is

791
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:42,860
something that's being tested right now it's an active hours sleep option so it's in the xbox

792
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:47,340
insider program right now which is kind of like their beta testing mechanism and in this you can

793
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:51,980
have your console shut down not sleep but shut down at times where you aren't using it and this

794
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,140
will cut down on your energy use which is pretty cool not that these things use a ton of energy

795
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:00,780
when they're sleeping but you know it adds up so it's nice to do that you can actually manually

796
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,700
schedule those hours if you kind of know like these are the times i play these are times i don't

797
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:11,740
but there's also an automatic option if you want the console console to adapt to what you tend to

798
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:17,580
do so it'll get take its best guess best based on when you play it this is going to be automatically

799
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:25,180
enabled on these systems too usually we aren't fans of these types of automatic opt-in sims uh

800
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:30,620
systems but i see the greater good they're going for with this you know if they're using less

801
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:35,740
energy overall and you know trying to you know contribute to making it greener then okay i i

802
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:40,540
think this is a fair thing to opt people into because you can opt out if you want to the xbox

803
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,700
one however will default to always active and you have to configure that yourself i'm assuming

804
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,340
that's probably just something to do with maybe the hardware or whatever just the age so there's

805
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:55,900
also a shut down energy saving option that uses 20 times less power than sleep while still allowing

806
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:01,660
the overnight updates to the xbox and the games so that's kind of neat so you know you know what's

807
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:09,660
had that for a very long time mac os well and and it's important to note in microsoft's camp

808
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:16,380
windows 11 also has a similar feature so there's it's nice to see everybody coming to the uh

809
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:27,340
greenery table it's been here for years all right um moving on star soccer what else has been here

810
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:33,180
for you um uh another company that for the longest time forgot how to count to three

811
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:40,460
um capcom now this is cool i actually sent this to to dan like right away um capcom has

834
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:21,100
event art and i might i might have to make this happen all right i like that they're letting

835
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:25,660
people participate virtually too since not everybody can just go to japan to see this

836
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:32,620
so that's pretty cool i need to see if i can find that website all right well let's move on we have

837
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:37,740
another story that um this is one of those things i'm kind of actually surprised with still going

838
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:45,740
but uh loki yeah so uh i i forgot about this as well because i i don't really use this but um

839
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:52,780
gog connect which was a service that allowed you to basically um i think wasn't this the one that

840
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:57,260
you allowed you to kind of import your different libraries from different things and allowed you

841
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:03,180
to have one launcher yep well i mean we should have known better that that's never gonna work

842
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:07,740
because especially when we're all sitting here going well i forgot about it and to be clear it's

843
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:14,300
not gog galaxy the actual like storefront in that launcher like that's right closed yeah yeah this

844
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,940
is the the launcher that basically combined all your libraries together you know like the good

845
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:25,260
thing that really it should be set up that way but um no i i didn't realize this was a service

846
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:30,780
i thought it would be like a piece of software but uh yeah it's not going to be they're going

847
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:37,820
to be discontinuing that as well so it's officially been killed off um it has a good point uh saying

848
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:42,060
i used it once but it was cool to get the extras from the gog versions that's true because the gog

849
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:47,420
versions often had like maybe a soundtrack or a digitized manuals and some other like cool little

850
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:53,340
embellishments that steam doesn't always have yeah so i mean that's cool if it was like unlocking

851
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:58,460
stuff and i could see like you know where they may have where you basically like copies of the

852
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:04,780
game or something like that but um yeah i don't know it still would be nice to have like a piece

853
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,620
of software that combined the libraries but at the same time like i don't find it massively

854
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:13,580
inconvenient either it's just i kind of forget what i have on certain platforms sometimes

855
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:21,500
all right well rip that service that we probably should have been checking in on more often because

856
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:27,580
sometimes you don't know what you got till it's gone so there's that all right um boy oh boy i'm

857
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:31,740
gonna admit i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this but all of you on discord were

858
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:36,060
really lighting up about this that i wanted to bring it up on the show even if it isn't directly

859
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:41,740
about video games it's certainly something that inspires shit tons of video games and that is

860
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:48,700
what's going on in the dungeons and dragons world and uh wizards of the coast this week uh i guess

861
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:55,740
there was a leaked version of their open games license that leaked out and the changes were

862
01:08:55,740 --> 01:09:00,540
interpreted that third-party publishers were going to be hurt and profits were going to increase of

863
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:04,700
course that's what these things are the ones that are not popular always go this way right

864
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:13,420
what the ogl is is it allows you to use aspects of dnd mechanics to create royalty-free content

865
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:18,620
so for example they're that you do these things called splat books which i'm not familiar with

866
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:24,460
that but they say that critical role which is a hugely popular show has one so i'm assuming

867
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:32,060
they're like fan campaigns or something that you can like make and sell basically uh right now um

868
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:36,380
and artistia says i think it came up in discord oh yeah y'all went off in discord which i wanted

869
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,220
to bring it up on the show because i do listen even if i don't always understand because i don't

870
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:46,860
play any dnd currently but i certainly recognize that without it we wouldn't have role-playing

871
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:52,540
games in the same state that we do now japanese or american like dnd has been hugely influential

872
01:09:52,540 --> 01:10:01,660
on all of it so anyway um so there's third-party tabletop content thanks to this ogl and all of

873
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:09,580
this so wizards of the coast announced one dnd which was a rules update and an online integration

874
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:16,380
that was going to be pushed alongside the fifth edition content but when they announced dnd beyond

875
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,260
this was when they recognized that there was going to be changes to the existing ogl

876
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:26,460
and there was skepticism because there's clause about royalties and if you make more than 750

877
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:33,660
000 then that was going to be part of that but then there was another article that came out on

878
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:40,780
january 5th that apparently the ogl 1.1 was almost 10 times the original document in size

879
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:45,660
and that it completely voided the original ogl so it's kind of almost going back to the youtube

880
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:53,020
thing it's changing all the rules after the fact so that the original ogl no longer is an authorized

881
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:59,580
license agreement so sucks to be you if you made something under that so for companies like paizo

882
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:05,740
that are is like a third-party creator that makes content around this this could have fucked them

883
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:12,380
royally and if you don't sign up for the new new ogl you can't make any income at all off the

884
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:18,140
products so of course people lost their fucking mind which you know people tend to do with changes

885
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:23,180
but when you retroactively change the rules rightfully so people are losing their mind

886
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:31,660
the creator of the original ogl and a former vice president of wizards of the coast ryan dancy went

887
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:36,860
on to say the original license was never intended to be rescinded and then a third-party publisher

888
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:42,540
cobalt press said that their open source rule set called project black i'm sorry it was announced it

889
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:47,580
wasn't they announced project black flag basically like we're gonna make your own fucking dnd

890
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:54,220
which some somewhat similar to what happened on twitter and mastodon even though that actually

891
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:59,980
that mastodon's a few years old at this point but it was to create something better well and

892
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:05,660
yeah the thing is is they they would know about it too because they were there they were the ones

893
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:10,460
that like helped draft the original agreement in the first place like some of these people

894
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:15,820
including their legal counsel and stuff so and let me point out wizards of the coast actually

895
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:25,740
had their own rpg system while dnd was uh still under tsr um so uh and then they bought i mean

896
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:29,420
there's probably a lot more i'm not going to go in the backstory i'm doing a very very simple story

897
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:37,420
but i mean that's just sort of like how how soon they forget yeah how soon they forget

898
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:42,380
so has bro tasbro pushing it just to give you yeah just to give you a sense of the rest of

899
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:48,380
the timeline on january 10th wizards posted to the dnd beyond twitter account saying more info

900
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:52,940
to come soon in other words read between the lines stop losing your fucking minds we're

901
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:59,020
asking the lawyers for an update but on january 12th piezo that third party responded and said

902
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:06,460
we're going to do our own system neutral open license a new open perpetual and irrevocable

903
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:13,500
irrevocable i can never say that word irrevocable uh open rpg creative license or orc for short

904
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:19,900
isn't that cute um and basically saying this is a key word there the one i can't pronounce right

905
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:26,620
that they can never pull it back irrevocable irrevocable so that uh wizards of the coast

906
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:29,980
obviously tried to make the change that's the biggest pain point there so that's very

907
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:37,340
interesting as well uh this orc license would be developed under uh azora law which is a firm that

908
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:41,980
specializes in intellectual property basically making sure that they walk that fucking fine

909
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:50,140
line and don't copy anything so um yeah principle is six as heck i'm about to fire up some dnd into

910
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:55,420
the stream and lurk in my stream if i host one yeah but then i said if i ever hosted a game

911
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:02,060
i only do second edition yeah um and yes i'm i'm i'm trying to get to the rest of the timeline

912
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:05,420
finara but everybody's getting their opinion which is fine which that's how we work here

913
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:12,700
so um wizards of the coast finally did a response january 13th so two days ago saying that the

914
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,740
changes were never intended to limit or prohibit players or aspiring desire designers were taking

915
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:23,580
their own work what they were trying to prevent and honestly i you know and again being a little

916
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:28,540
bit more of an outsider in this situation this was the right thing to say they were trying to

917
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:35,900
prevent web 3 and nft products based on dnd rules okay that's jumping up that's a reasonable

918
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:44,700
response yes the way you did it yeah the way you did it not so great but i if it took you three

919
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:50,220
days to come up with the best possible response then so be it uh they also do not want their

920
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:55,740
content appearing in hateful and discriminatory discriminatory products also certainly

921
01:14:55,740 --> 01:15:00,940
understandable and they want major corporations to not use the ogl and commercial releases

922
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:07,260
so the new ogl will be reconfigured to specify that it covers only content for tabletop rpgs

923
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:13,580
and thus shouldn't impact the rest of the fan content out there live streams cosplay for charity

924
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:19,660
wizards and hasbro's trying to say you're safe and with all this stuff so but you know

925
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:27,500
as the story goes it doesn't matter what you intended it matters what is perceived so it

926
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:31,900
will be interesting to see if they can push back or if they can get back from this because now

927
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:38,220
this orc thing is started this project black flag is started that's that's a faucet you can't turn

928
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:44,140
off now at this point so wizards is already going to pay a price for this even if they are able to

929
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:49,500
calm people down going no no we're just trying to say fuck those nft guys with the rest of you oh

930
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:59,340
okay so anyway for life dark soccer is holding up her second edition players handbook there

931
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:07,260
um uh fanara in chat says to quote wizards of the coast we rolled a one yes yeah so

932
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:16,540
anyway it'll be interesting to see what happens all right uh join the conversation on our discord

933
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:23,660
if you'd like to over at vog network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord um fixation gaze uh

934
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:28,940
is in our chat hello hello saying my new friend it's it's our legion now wizards and hasbro

935
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:37,020
wanted to steal art under a license they wanted free use of any art that was posted so you know

936
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:43,020
and again when you do things without explaining them which is what hasbro did you allow the

937
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:48,620
internet to come up with the conclusions that they're drawing whether that was what was intended

938
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:53,580
or not and it certainly does point out you know again if this was hasbro's intention or not

939
01:16:54,940 --> 01:17:01,260
it still looks shitty so uh tiger call with another interesting perspective saying this is

940
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:07,340
going to affect the box office for the upcoming dnd movie because people will not see it in spite

941
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:11,660
cause of what happened wait wait wait i missed this they're doing another one weren't the last

942
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:17,260
two attempts like because krull was supposed to be a dnd movie and i love krull don't get me wrong

943
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:21,900
it has amazing actors and amazing scenes in it but it's not very cohesive and then the actual

944
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:27,100
dnd movie that came out i enjoyed it because it was stupid but it wasn't very good either

945
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:33,260
and now they're doing another one yes and and chris pine plays a bard

946
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:42,780
i do want to see it it looks good i saw the trailer it looks okay it's no megan but you know

947
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:51,500
it's no cocaine bear but you know yeah uh other comments in chat uh fixation case clarifying this

948
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:56,380
was actually brought up in a whistleblowing email they did intend to steal from the community oh

949
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:04,060
that's yeah that's a yikes those emails getting leaked as yeah again i'm not like an avid player

950
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:10,140
of dnd currently so i'm not following this as closely but that's that's a yike that was why a

951
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:17,980
lot of people were leaving deviantart because deviantart had i think some option that if your

952
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:23,340
artwork was uploaded on their website they could make like a certain profit off of selling off some

953
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:30,460
of your artwork which funny enough i also i saw this in our discord somebody's suing deviantart

954
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:36,140
and all of those ai art companies about stealing all the artwork and i i should have occurred to

955
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:41,100
me it's only a matter of time before someone does that and here we are so somebody's suing

956
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:45,660
not only deviantart but all those ai companies over the ai stolen artwork basically the only

957
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:51,420
reason i didn't cancel my account there is because i do enjoy seeing what some of my favorite

958
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:58,460
comic book artists are doing and getting stuff to use in daz 3d but like my artwork all every

959
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:04,540
last piece of art i have ever done on deviantart has been removed yeah i i used to host my portfolio

960
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:11,340
there no i remember those days yeah yeah my i had some decent stuff on my portfolio back in the day

961
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:16,380
but i do a lot better work now don't sell yourself short um no it was it was pretty crappy i was very

962
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:23,340
new it's like me going back to read my old live journal i'm like oh god because actually there

963
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:28,540
was a conversation that led me to go look at live journal oh somebody in the orange channel in

964
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:33,980
discord they were talking about why was there an episode this and an episode 0.5 and i went to my

965
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:38,780
live journal to find out oh that was when i was traveling for work and it was i was at katsu khan

966
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:43,180
one weekend and traveling for work the next weekend and loki did like a solo show that

967
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:46,540
weekend so it was like a point five because you must have been indisposed as well dark

968
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:51,180
soccer or something happened because loki did a solo show so anyway oh my god i actually forgot

969
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:55,740
my login i want to get just a couple other comments on this from some folks that play

970
01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:00,380
dnd a little more right now uh and then we'll move on to our next topic uh quest buster says

971
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:06,220
expanding on fixation gaze's point the new ogl had language that allowed wizards of the

972
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:12,060
coast to publish your work anywhere they wanted without paying you also if your ip under ogl 1.1

973
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:17,260
made less than 50k you had to report those numbers you were literally landing handing

974
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:23,100
the keys to your livelihood to wizards of the coast and fixation gaze uh piggybacked on that

975
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:29,420
saying exactly they are backtracking so i would also like to point out that youtube sort of has

976
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:36,700
something very similar going on um is that with any content that's posted on youtube they can

977
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:44,140
take that content and reuse it as an ad on another site that's how they do their ads on um

978
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:49,740
on facebook for example without at all letting you know about it

979
01:20:52,540 --> 01:21:00,060
wow wow so all right yeah all right well it's in their tsc let's take a trip back to simpler times

980
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:05,980
when uh you know there there were no nfts and uh we if you wanted to change the rules of the game

981
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:11,500
you literally couldn't do a patch so uh and and back to a time when people were still

982
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:18,780
playing second edition dnd on a massive scale let's get to the bump this is this isn't that old

983
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:23,020
okay maybe third edition here we go um

984
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:37,020
and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull

985
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:41,980
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week

986
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:50,140
and dark soccer what did you pick tonight it picked a game called retro city rampage which

987
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:57,020
has a great name um so at any rate um this is an action adventure game that was developed by

988
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:05,260
v blank entertainment it's a parody of retro games from the 80s and 90s and also they're the the pop

989
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:10,700
culture that went with those eras and grand theft auto and very similar games it was released on the

990
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:20,380
playstation 3 the ps vita and uh windows in 2012 with later ports on other systems the enhanced

991
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:28,380
version retro city rampage dx was released for the nintendo 3ds in 2014 with other ports afterwards

992
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:36,140
um the the fun thing about this is that there is an ms das version uh retro city rampage 486

993
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:43,420
was uh also released in july 29th 2015 it's a limited physical run on a floppy disk

994
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:51,100
as well as a digital download um god floppy disks i remember having descent on 14 three and a

995
01:22:51,100 --> 01:23:01,900
quarters um anyway um you are in the city of theft off theftropolis in 1985 and you are the player

996
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:10,460
a thug for hire who um you work for crime syndicate led by the jester and then um you uh

997
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:17,260
during a bad uh bad heist you run into a time traveling telephone booth where we've seen this

998
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:26,060
before bill and ted and the doctor um the booth sends you uh to the the year 20 x dx

999
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:33,580
i i love that um and then the booth breaks down and a guy named doc chuck who is supposed to be

1000
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:40,940
like you know dr brown from back to the future um arrives and rescues you and he thinks that

1001
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:46,300
you're like some hero when you're just an accidental person oh yeah 20 x d6 that's right

1002
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:54,140
um so you go through you know you have uh different types of parodies of people um you

1003
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:58,700
you know you have your parody law enforcement the jester bayside high school students

1004
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:07,420
and dr von buttnick yes like dr robotnik um and he's the head of rnd at at core

1005
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,900
and they want to use the time machine to control the electronics market

1006
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:19,260
anyway um the game was inspired by grand theft auto and that you uh do a different bunch of

1007
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:28,060
missions in a huge open city um and they they planned 50 story missions and 30 challenge levels

1008
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:33,980
um and uh like there's like all kinds of different shops and all kinds of different things they have

1009
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:39,500
homage to different 8-bit video games um different elements from different genre

1010
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:45,900
different graphics filters that can simulate the different uh types of computers and game controls

1011
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:49,660
and it is played top down bird's eye like the original gta games

1012
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:57,180
um and so and it also can switch um into a 2d perspective like platformer

1013
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:05,180
um the game also has free roaming mode that lets you just run around the city and just cause

1014
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:11,260
trouble the whole time um you can play it with unlockable characters from other uh indie developed

1015
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:16,700
games like super meat boy commander video from the bit trip series and steve from minecraft and

1016
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:24,860
others um on february 28th uh the day of the we release the pc update became available allowing

1017
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:31,180
you to play the game's prototype called rom city rampage and it is a port of retro city rampage to

1018
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:39,340
ness homebrew and emulated within retro city rampage um so pc users got it for free it was

1019
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:44,780
included with the wii and 3ds versions and then it was later released on psn and xbox live

1020
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:54,460
so conceptually the game came from a homebrew project in 2002 um a game programmer named

1021
01:25:54,460 --> 01:26:02,140
brian provinciano uh constructed a nes system development kit and was trying to remake grand

1022
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:10,540
theft auto 3 with 8-bit uh sprites calling it grand theftendo and then uh he uh showed it off

1023
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:17,180
at the 2011 game developers conference showed his methods you know and people were interested in it

1024
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:21,660
so new characters added more stuff was doing he ended up working on it full time

1025
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:26,940
and the rest is history so some of the games that are referenced in this

1026
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:35,340
um are river city ransom uh which is also uh niketsu hot downtown story i always get the

1027
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:40,460
name messed up non-super mario brothers legend zelda mega man contra bionic commando metal gear

1028
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:46,860
smash tvs uh teenage mutant turtles a bunch of others and then there had cheesy one-liners in

1029
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:57,740
there um with cameos by phil fish from fez uh billy campbell and phil guerrero um of ytv fame

1030
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,340
um and uh

1031
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:07,900
of course uh one thing they are quick to say is that even though it's called

1032
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:16,460
uh retro city rampage it is not a reference to river city ransom in the name um so

1033
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:24,140
there is a limited edition we port of retro city rampages uh sequel shakedown hawaii

1034
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:31,420
um that was a europe exclusive limited port and then they said uh they were doing a physical we

1035
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:37,660
version of retro city rampage with ref called retro city rampage dx plus that would also be

1036
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:46,300
released uh on july 9 2020 and had a limited run of 3 000 copies um just cleaned up and looking

1037
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:53,340
better um so it got really good reviews very positive it got a 71 on medicritic

1038
01:27:53,900 --> 01:28:01,900
um as of march 2013 the game sold 100 000 copies ps3 and pc versions made the most profit

1039
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:10,620
um as of december 2014 the developer said that the game had reached 400 000 sold copies

1040
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:19,420
and an additional uh 270 000 playstation plus units while also uh stating pc and playstation

1041
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:25,980

1056
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:06,460
gaming world quickly and check out some rapid fire news uh from across the gaming globe so

1057
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:13,820
loki we'll start with you yeah uh well we'll talk a little bit about game pass and uh playstation

1060
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:38,140
danganronpa trigger happy havoc nobody saves the world paparazzi uh the anacrusius and we happy

1061
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:43,740
few and windjammers 2 and then of course playstation plus those are some pretty big

1062
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:50,860
titles to be losing but persona that's a big land too so you know i guess it evens out a little bit

1063
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:59,420
yeah uh playstation plus is going to be getting uh looks like devil may cry 5

1064
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:04,540
back for blood and also uh let's see what else here

1065
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:16,300
um yeah so devil may cry 5 special edition back for blood and we've got a dragon ball fighter z

1066
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:24,780
uh erica jet the far shore just cause for reloaded life is strange life is strange before the storm

1067
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:34,060
omno sinai wild wild hearts two uh star wars demolition and siphon filter 3 what the heck

1068
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:40,220
is star wars demolition anyways filter yes i haven't felt through three those are playstation

1069
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:46,060
one games the last three and yeah i was like i haven't heard that game in an age well it's nice

1070
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:50,220
to see playstation bumping up their back catalog but i i still feel like that service isn't catching

1071
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:56,380
on the same way i have no interest in it yeah i think that at all the drip feeding's too slow

1072
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:08,380
open the floodgates all right uh what else and then uh yeah uh let's see i think uh this is

1073
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:14,940
pretty funny so they've got a brand new final fantasy 7 mod that adds voice acting to the pc

1074
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:19,580
version and so this is the classic final fantasy 7 because obviously the modern ones have voice

1075
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:28,700
acting but uh it's called echo s7 i can get it at asuna mods and it basically adds yeah

1076
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:34,140
voice acting to all the characters in final fantasy 7 i think there may even be like

1077
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:38,060
six basically through the original script but i think it might be some embellishments on some

1078
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:44,140
stuff but neat i'd be willing to check it out what's the sound arith makes when she bites it

1079
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,660
i did not show that in the preview video so i'm not sure

1080
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:52,940
that just makes me think of that thing with

1081
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,860
christopher lee telling someone how someone dies when they're stabbed in the back and not to argue

1082
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:06,140
with them uh they're also apparently the the team that put it out um is also working on voice acting

1083
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:13,980
mods for final fantasy 8 and 9 as well oh boy all right it's kind of interesting that's interesting

1084
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:24,460
all right uh dark sakura so um there's a live action dungeon dragons tv series uh at paramount

1085
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:34,620
plus i'm not going to watch it um it is uh they're basically jumping off of the the halo bandwagon

1086
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:41,660
even though the halo thing sucked um and uh so it's paramount uh pictures and e1 are partnering

1087
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:48,860
to produce the series um they're also the ones behind the movie and uh it's a large scope tv

1088
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:58,140
project uh that they're gonna be putting out um they also were um there's another one on here

1089
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:02,060
oh yeah um the honor monk thieves also has michelle rodriguez so maybe i'll see it because of

1090
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:06,220
because of her um hugh grant's in it i didn't know hugh grant was in it wow

1091
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:14,460
anyway um so yeah that that's uh that's planning to come out um i'm gonna i would rather watch

1092
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:20,380
willow just saying um s2100 matt in chat going back to the uh voice acting file has the seventh

1093
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:28,380
story talking about arith dying says they should swap in the Waluigi way in there well it'd be in

1094
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:33,180
a mod you know you probably could get that yeah you can just make the mario died sound

1095
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:41,100
all right i'm sure we'll see all sorts of youtubes that have different death noises

1096
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:47,820
slight because the ultimate one would be to have um a throwback to remember the dear sister short

1097
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:53,980
on saturday night live and when she gets killed have it go what you say when you want

1098
01:34:53,980 --> 01:35:01,740
uh yeah i'm sure that probably already exists because everybody was doing dear sister

1099
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:10,300
parodies back in the day all right anyway uh one more story for you uh for rapid fire news talking

1100
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:17,420
about oh the end of a virtual compendium for the sega mega drive bitmap books uh has to cancel

1101
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:23,660
their mega drive visual compendium because sega has threatened it legally uh this would have been

1102
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:29,180
the eighth release in the bitmap book series there's been atari 2600 Commodore 64 a lot of

1103
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:34,540
you linked to me that one it looked pretty cool Amiga NES and SNES these are hefty books they're

1104
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:40,540
coffee table books basically with visual material for the platform's archives sprites stages box art

1105
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:46,460
marketing materials sega originally backed bitmap books for a sega master system edition

1106
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:52,700
but wouldn't do the same thing for the 16-bit version so in a statement to bitmap books fans

1107
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:57,100
the creative director sam dyer said we've had to push back the release date a few times and as of

1108
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:02,060
now we have not communicated why i'm afraid to say that we've been asked by sega to remove the listing

1109
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:07,100
or face potential legal action as a small business this is not something we can risk after discussions

1110
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:12,060
their position is non-negotiable it is of course their right to protect their ip as they see fit

1111
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:16,540
now of course people in chat talking about you know dart tsu is saying i mean that's the sort

1112
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:22,540
of thing i might expect from nintendo but yeah sega not usually the company to do this sort of

1113
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:28,780
thing so it's odd uh and you have to wonder are they trying to cook up something of their own or

1114
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:35,500
what's the deal so anyway they are yeah they're trying to find a way to release it as a free pdf

1115
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:41,420
as long as that's legally viable so now they're going the weird hour out where oh well gaga wants

1116
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:46,060
to tell me not to which it wasn't gaga it was one of her people wants to tell me i can't do that

1117
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:51,340
song well i'll just put it out for free on youtube and i think he did that with a couple other songs

1118
01:36:51,340 --> 01:37:00,300
too so uh but anyway yeah so no notebook for you for mega drive sorry about that all right uh let's

1138
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:25,340
a call over at vog network.com discord yeah uh so net ease has basically dissolved the team that

1139
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:32,620
was maintaining the blizzard games in china um they've been i guess laid off or uh reassigned

1140
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:37,980
to different projects and this is ending i guess they were working those for 14 years wow that's a

1141
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:45,660
long time um so yeah that's uh there is less than 100 people affected by that but that's

1142
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:50,780
you know still a lot of staff that's been reallocated stuff i mean we don't need to

1143
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:56,060
maintain blizzard games anymore right you know it's it's fine i'm self-sustaining i'm surprised

1144
01:39:56,060 --> 01:40:02,940
there wasn't a last minute reprieve on all of that but they sure i mean this is very finalized for

1145
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:11,580
all of that isn't it so yeah apparently um the the contract was not renewed by blizzard so maybe

1146
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:17,260
they're handling it internally or just saying and whatever you know i don't know but that of course

1147
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:24,380
affects overwatch 2 diablo 3 world of warcraft starcraft hearthstone heroes of the storm so

1148
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:32,780
so and uh those games will be now unplayable in china sucks if you live in china it sucks for

1149
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:37,180
people that invested hours upon hours in those games i can't even imagine something like that

1150
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:43,980
happening over here that's for sure all right yeah that sucks so before we get to our next story

1151
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,420
guess what i found over on youtube

1152
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:50,860
all right let me check this out

1153
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:01,420
i'm doing this i'm doing this live what to say

1154
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:10,700

1159
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:50,460

1160
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:56,300
personality yeah i i i like her character in the new version as woman in refrigerator you know

1161
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:01,100
what i mean and that's why when they they flip the script and they don't kill her in the next

1162
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:05,420
one it's gonna it's gonna hit differently because it's gonna happen they're not gonna kill her

1163
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:14,140
west muster has the has a thing like tears in the rain thank you mr replicant um anyway um stadia

1164
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:19,100

1165
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:26,780
uh they are releasing the worm game it is a very simple snake-like game that stadia uh

1166
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:33,740
that stadia's cloud features were used uh for were tested using this game um and their statement says

1167
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:38,540
play the game that came to stadia before stadia came to the world worm game is a humble title

1168
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:43,580
we use to test many of stadia's features starting well before our 2019 public launch right through

1169
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:49,900
2022 it looks cute i like that i'll say it won't win game of the year but we spent a lot of time

01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:55,180
playing it we think it's fun here you go thank you i'm looking i'll give it a go i was gonna

01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:55,340
changed the way i go to the bathroom this is interesting marketing way i wish i'd bought

1181
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:59,420
that when it came out all right just a few more stories then we'll get to the listener roundtable

1182
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:07,580
so loki yeah so there's been an announcement i guess that a new mech warrior game is being

1183
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:15,820
worked on by piranha games and it's supposed to be released in 2024 um basically it was teased

1184
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:22,300
you know i'll i'll just say that it's not mech warrior online too and it's not a successor to

1185
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:27,500
mech warrior online and it's not an online pvp game think of it more like in line with

1186
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:35,180
mech warrior 5 but a standalone game a standalone product cool i like mech warrior so we need to see

1187
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:41,580
yeah i know dartistry is a big fan too so i'm sure some people will uh be very happy about that so

1188
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:47,580
yeah all right and uh lots of people very happy this week with the results of awesome games done

1189
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:53,820
quick of course awesome games done quick doing awesome things and they raised 2.6 million dollars

1190
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:59,900
when all was said and done for the prevent cancer foundation uh not a bad chunk of change whatsoever

1191
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:08,300
folks do feel the need to point out though it is less than the 3.4 million agt agdq 2022 picked up

1192
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:12,060
i kind of go there's a couple ways you can kind of address it number one i sort of think you

1193
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:17,580
can't keep breaking the ceiling every time number two the economy is in a different place number

1194
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:23,180
three the and this is this isn't a secret it's not exactly like advertised greatly but it's not

1195
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:27,100
a secret and bobby got into it more on his show tonight because as i'm sure you all know bobby

1196
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:31,820
blackwolf uh here at voice geeks network has done some of the announcing for games done quick

1197
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:36,940
including this most recent one he goes way more in depth on his show so i'll leave it for that but

1198
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:41,340
usually they would take the bits and the subs they'd kind of dump it all into the pot towards

1199
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:48,140
the end of the run and do that this time because remember they they canceled the florida in person

1200
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:53,740
one because of a multi-tooled reason some of it being their complete lack of covid precautions

1201
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:58,460
and like the fact you could not in florida you cannot tell people you must be vaccinated to be

1202
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:05,980
here or the event could get sued because we all know florida is run by a interesting individual

1203
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:11,740
and i'll leave that at that also uh quite frankly there's a lot of lgbtq individuals that are

1204
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:15,340
involved with awesome games done quick not just speedrunners themselves but people affiliated

1205
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:20,380
with the organization and there were people that were like if it's in florida i'm not going

1206
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:27,660
because i don't feel safe there um so for a multitude of reasons games done quick had to

1207
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:33,580
basically pull out of florida so the bits and the subs had to go to the cancellation fees because

1208
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:39,340
that's a contract they couldn't get out of unfortunately even though it is charity and

1209
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:44,940
the money so awesome game so if you're like upset hearing that because you gave bits or subs or

1210
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:50,540
whatever don't be mad at awesome games done quick be mad at florida for keeping them on the hook for

1211
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:57,500
that so anyway i'll leave the rest to bobby blackwolf on his show let's go back and focus

1212
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:02,380
on the good uh 2.6 million is still a hell of a lot of money that's going to do a lot of good over

1213
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:09,100
at the prevent cancer foundation uh and apparently there was one person that donated 100 000 that's

1214
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:14,700
a very uh large donation i wonder who the mystery person is uh also a new world record was set in

1215
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:20,780
super mario galaxy 2 which is pretty cool uh the event of course was all online and the summer

1216
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:27,660
games done quick event has been announced for may 28th little earlier than usual uh perhaps because

1217
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:33,020
they've found an in-person location to do it perhaps but we don't know no confirmation yet if

1218
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:39,660
it is in person or if it will be virtual once again i have a feeling it'll be in person because

1219
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:43,420
i'll tell you again if you go back to bobby's show because he went to summer games done quick last

1220
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:49,740
year i'll tell you that was the most covid precautions i've seen at any convention and if

1221
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:56,620
they even do a fraction of that for this next year it'll be fine uh and that that event the summer

1222
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:02,300
one was never historically in florida it was in minnesota historically assuming they go back there

1223
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:09,500
any of those covid guidelines should not be a problem so we'll see what happens all right yeah

1224
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:13,180
tiger class says summer games is usually is quite early it's usually around june yeah it's pretty

1225
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:17,980
close to my birthday usually so it's pretty pretty early that they're doing this so um but you know

1226
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:23,100
hey anytime is a good time to raise money for doctors without borders which is what the summer

1227
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:28,540
event goes to so we will keep an eye out and uh best of luck to any of you that are submitting

1228
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:33,420
your own speed runs or auditioning to be a host like bobby blackwolf who has to audition every

1229
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:38,940
time because no one gets grandfathered into that which i also think is pretty cool that like they

1230
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:44,940
don't just have a click that's impenetrable like they make people practice every time basically to

1231
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:52,220
get in so all right um that's it for our slotted stories tonight so i want to go to our list of

1232
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:56,540
roundtable unfortunately i don't think we have any emails tonight i'll confer with dark soccer

1233
01:48:56,540 --> 01:49:04,700
though no uh so purchase participate at orange longtrader.com is the place to send an email if

1234
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:10,860
you would like to so um by the way ssj100 matt wants to point out speaking of convention

1235
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:17,980
protection magfest's early numbers came in and as of thursday they've had 76 positive cases

1236
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:24,700
but that's out of 20 000 people so pretty good pretty good compared to the rest of the world

1237
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:31,660
so yeah what do you know masks work all right yeah yeah all right um

1238
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,860
so let me check with uh loki and see if there's any last minute stories

1239
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:43,580
um there's a few rumors i guess rumors and speculation if you will so there was

1240
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:47,500
a rumor that there's a detachable disk drive coming to the playstation 5

1241
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:56,540
i don't know why you would do that but um is that for the all digital one to convert that yes but

1242
01:49:56,540 --> 01:50:01,580
why like why would you do that i don't know i don't know i don't think there would be a demand

1243
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:07,660
for that but i mean it's apparently they're saying that there's test kits in players or

1244
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:14,940
people's hands and it works flawlessly okay yeah it's gotta be def says the same thing in chat for

1245
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:19,340
the digital version probably it's gotta be but i didn't maybe with the supply issues a lot of

1246
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:24,300
people settled for digital that didn't really want to i i don't know i don't know it's hard is there

1247
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:33,180
a thing like because like i remember um their drives don't play like certain types of discs

1248
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:39,180
maybe like to support playstation 2 disks or something like that i don't know but like it

1249
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:44,140
yeah i don't know i don't see a point for it yeah the disk if the disk drives let you play all the

1250
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:49,740
old playstation games hell yeah now you're talking but i just don't see that yeah you know it'd be

1251
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:55,420
cool it's like a disk drive it has a disk drive and it has like the old playstation memory card

1252
01:50:55,420 --> 01:51:01,580
slots too and that would be pretty sweet but yeah i don't see that fifth dream says all playstation

1253
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:07,260
rumor i hear all playstation 5 soon will be one skew and this drive is to add to that oh

1254
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:13,340
is that i i would not like that oh no they're gonna sell it separately back back

1255
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:22,380
well i mean to be fair to be fair like digital game sales though it's been really high compared

1256
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:32,540
to physical game sales um so i mean i get it i get it but you also you i may not get a playstation

1257
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:38,380
5 if i can't find one with a disk drive i'm not buying one like i have all these playstation 4

1258
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:42,940
games i would like to be able to play on the 5 as well i have my library you'll be able to get one

1259
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:47,820
for like you'll be able to get one i'm sure that they'll have them out there but yeah i could see

1260
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:51,820
them doing like a revision maybe they'll do like an even slimmer model or something like that and

1261
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:58,220
there's only the all digital version for that or something because they can't make it a slimmer

1262
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:02,460
with the disk drive jutting out there i mean as it is with the disk drive in there it looks

1263
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:11,020
looks kind of ugly i don't know all right well it looks like we do have at least one caller that

1264
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:15,660
would like to call in tonight so let's bring them on the air and this is someone we hear from quite

1277
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:32,780
lovely though i have to say thank you you're welcome so i have mentioned on the show previously

1278
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:39,100
i have a friend named matt who has a ddr third mix machine in his house and he's giving it to me

1279
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:47,260
wow what no this matt this matt has a dr extreme in his house what are you talking about okay so

1280
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:53,100
we have um west coast matt and east coast matt i know like i know like 20 people named matt

1281
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:59,500
that's why they all have nicknames that's why this one's low-key so exactly yeah so

1282
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:07,020
we have a group chat going and look at east coast matt's like i want to have a party we're talking

1283
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:14,700
ddr bimani come over let's have a ddr party so he throws together a ddr party i go in my closet

1284
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:20,540
i grab some sweats i grab a shirt so i'm like yeah i'm going to be hurting the next day so

1285
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:27,340
we all go to his house and i see the machine being updated now normally it's a third mix machine with

1286
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:34,540
a computer running stepmania okay it seems this time one of the people that we hang out with

1287
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:44,540
brought a copy of the latest release of ddr was it the omni mix or was it yes uh-huh

1288
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:55,180
uh-huh i've seen this too but i can't say where exactly so an hour later after setting it up

1289
01:54:55,180 --> 01:55:01,100
here we are all playing omni mix and we're going through every single release of ddr

1290
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:07,980
and we're just even doing like an infinite event mode loop it's like we're doing three songs that

1291
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:15,580
we jump off and three more two more people jump up it was just nuts and i'm like i am going to

1292
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:23,420
be hurting in the morning i have not played this much ddr and god knows how long the first time i

1293
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:27,660
saw that i spent so much time just going through the song list and listening to all the little

1294
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:33,740
clips bringing back memory all the xbox games it was all the xbox games because um the individual

1295
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:38,220
that i was looking at this with was not as familiar with the xbox games so we were yeah

1296
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:42,460
looking at that so uh by the way there's a 2d x omni mix too if you didn't know

1297
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:47,180
you shouldn't tell me things like that i'm just saying because there's a

1298
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:52,940
beatmania controller in my closet for the ps2 it's pretty hot it's pretty sexy yeah

1299
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:59,900
hey obviously i cannot tell you where or why or how or even i might there's hypothetically

1300
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:05,420
there's a 2d x omnium would i say that i say hypothetically there's one i uh rob you're drooling

1301
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:14,780
and that's why i post it in the vog discord that picture you know i'm just like y'all gotta see

1302
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:25,180
this so so between ddr and the copious amount of adult beverages good time was had all around

1303
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:31,660
and i'm just like good lord i feel like i i feel like i'm i'm at a con somewhere we're just

1304
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:36,780
sitting around having a good time jumping up on the machine just finding three songs to play and

1305
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:43,740
just going for broke brown chan yes you just made my brain do the weirdest crossover ever

1306
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:52,540
oh yeah picture it sicily 1912 a young girl finds her first ddr machine at a casino

1307
01:56:56,380 --> 01:57:01,500
um one did orange right is in chat it reminded me of something important too is that hypothetically

1308
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:06,380
if ddr and beatmania 2d x had omni mixes there's probably one for pop and music as well and it's

1309
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:14,060
probably installable on a machine hypothetically so the difference is with this is that

1310
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:21,500
we were actually running omni mix on a regular pc and since it took us it took some time to get it

1311
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:25,980
up and running the way it should be we're all pitching together to upgrade the ddr machine

1312
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:33,900
something a little more potent well good times that that sounds like a lot of fun so it was

1313
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:39,020
because i'm just sitting there going through all of this and and i'm just like i remembered

1314
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:45,660
any this song i remember this is the very first song i did on hard mode and then i find out that

1315
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:54,220
there is an underground emus network i i definitely have never heard about that before no i definitely

1316
01:57:54,220 --> 01:58:00,860
not absolutely what you're talking about that you get in trouble you get in trouble for that konami

1317
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:05,660
will sue would never do anything in lee perish the thought sounds like we kind of went along

1318
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:13,820
the lines of fight club what's the first rule of fight club it's the very the very same first thing

1319
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:21,420
i was told about it yeah see last night was just a lot of fun and i just needed to share this with

1320
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:29,180
y'all because no it's it was it was just fun and i'm just like oh i'm going to be hurting in the

1321
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:36,380
morning but oddly enough i guess between the adult beverages and so forth i felt pretty good

1322
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:42,700
when i got up slept in but i felt pretty good pretty damn good when i got up well that's that's

1323
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:49,020
a lot of fun so um i i i would normally say something like um gosh i wish i could have been

1324
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:53,100
there to play that too because i bet playing that machine would be a lot of fun um but instead i'm

1325
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:58,620
in this place where i'm like i'm glad you got to play it it's a lot of fun well rob i tell you what

1326
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:02,860
the next time you come out this way i already came we're going to bring you to the machine

1327
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:09,740
well the next time you come out this way i'm gonna introduce you to a friend of mine oh my

1328
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:16,540
and it's kind of interesting you said that because with universal studios opening up

1329
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:24,940
super nintendo world i'm like the four of us need to go honestly truth there's some they've

1330
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:29,260
been doing soft openings and of course it's all over tik somehow that got into my tik tok

1331
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:35,340
algorithm so i see all of these people going to super nintendo world in my tik tok but it looks

1332
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:40,300
it looks really cool it looks like you could spend like you could spend disney level dollars there

1333
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:45,820
but it does look really cool and we need mario hats i need one of those fucking wristbands i

1334
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:51,020
want a princess peach wristband are you fucking kidding me and i know you want a luigi one so

1335
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:58,140
it's not if not luigi daisy oh they have daisy ones i don't know but i'm just saying you know

1336
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:03,580
oh bobby also reminds me the tron ride opens in orlando on april 4th

1337
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:09,420
i'm not thrilled about the prospect of going to florida but for tron i always say i'll do almost

1338
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:17,340
anything so that um i'm actually potentially looking at maybe extending a trip out there so

1339
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:23,100
i can do disney but a lot of it depends on money and things i don't want to talk about on air just

1340
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:27,340
because they have to do with money so assuming i have money i would love to make something like

1341
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:32,220
that happen keep in mind alan is coming with me to dragon con this year which is pretty exciting

1342
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:38,700
so oh he's going to begin for he's going to get lost in the sauce yeah yeah uh finara also says

1343
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:44,860
orlando is a bit better than most places in florida oh for sure it's you know it's it's um

1344
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:50,460
an island of decency and an ocean of piss sorry to our florida listeners

1345
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:57,020
or if you're from new york you you know why you have that reputation each and everybody that

1346
02:00:57,020 --> 02:01:03,420
lives there know why you have that reputation so i'm sorry but also you understand also but rob

1347
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:09,740
it's also said if you're from new york basically it's like the southern half of florida is just

1348
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:15,420
a new york wannabe because of all the people moving down there like the upper half

1349
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:22,380
bottom half you know i'm walking here come on

1350
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:29,260
sorry sj100 matt said something in chat and i had an i forgot moment until he said that

1351
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:35,020
in chat and i was like i i absolutely will matt thank you for reminding me that that's

1352
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:43,820
a thing anyway um what else was i gonna say i don't know i was gonna thank my friend rama

1353
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:50,860
for calling into the show uh anything else you want to uh tell us about uh i went out

1354
02:01:50,860 --> 02:02:00,220
earlier and bought about 12 cans of imported sparkling water what for well we talked about

1355
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:04,620
this on on anime jam session a while back it seems that there's a taiwanese company that

1356
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:12,300
put out like themed canned sparkling water cans you can get uh king of fighters street fighter

1357
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:19,100
dragon ball z and of course uh sailor moon so i kind of went i had to get ones and i

1358
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:24,860
kind of had to get one of each senshi so where can i get that for alan uh super rob

1359
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:28,220
man and ranch they don't have any of the sailor moon ones though and they don't have the outer

1360
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:33,580
senshi i wonder if i could go to a different market i'm gonna find that because i'm gonna

1361
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:38,780
find that for my husband i did find them online for the record okay and if you and i do a joint

1362
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:43,980
order we can get some free shipping what about that place over on florin that's not 99 ranch

1363
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:51,980
but the other brand i haven't i don't go there and i haven't seen them at um actually they may

1364
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:58,300
have them at oto's but oto's always charges more i'll pay for for alan i'd pay it but they're not

1365
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:03,340
they're not that expensive like like two bucks a can uh 99 i paid two bucks a can that's not that

1366
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:09,100
bad i still have like a couple of them in my fridge that he could have because i don't like

1367
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:14,060
sparkling water okay well i just for the novelty of it they'll just sit on this shelf they'll never

1368
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:23,100
get drunk all right but they're really tasty though just basically it tastes like a can and

1369
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:27,260
a piece of fruit that sat next to the can you know what sparkling water is for mixing with alcohol

1370
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:34,940
all right it's it's not even for watering my plants i mean you can't beat that kind of logic

1371
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:40,060
just saying all right rom i'm gonna let you go so we wrap up the show but any of the thoughts

1374
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:59,260
