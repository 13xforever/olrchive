00:30.000 --> 00:37.280
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki to tell you about the very welcoming week of gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.040
Rob Roberts is joined every Sunday night as we broadcast with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.800
Hello. Hello. How are you, my friend?

01:10.680 --> 01:11.360
Alright.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.160
Yeah. Just just okay. Just alright.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.280
I have a little bit of a headache.

01:15.320 --> 01:15.960
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15.960 --> 01:21.160
I mean, it's it's the I'm going back to work on Wednesday.

01:21.200 --> 01:21.840
Yeah.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.480
And I don't know how I how I feel.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.200
Yeah. Well, yeah, it's understandable.

01:28.280 --> 01:31.080
I bet your co-workers miss you, though, except are you going back in person?

01:31.080 --> 01:32.600
I can't remember if you go to the office.

01:32.600 --> 01:33.280
Two days a week.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.120
Okay. Okay. So some some. Okay.

01:35.400 --> 01:35.880
Yeah.

01:36.160 --> 01:36.640
Gotcha.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.200
Out of, you know, my four days.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.360
And I know that like the first two days I get there are going to be, hey, do all your training.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.120
Hey, look how much email you have.

01:45.160 --> 01:45.720
Oh, guess what?

01:45.720 --> 01:48.440
You have to upgrade your OS on two computers.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.040
That's the worst part about taking any time off.

01:51.040 --> 01:55.120
You can take a day off and it's like the email mountain you come back to is always absurd.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.920
And thankfully, like 90 percent of it is stuff that I can delete.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.160
It's just.

02:03.480 --> 02:08.840
I set up mail rules and they don't always work, and I'll leave it at that.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.600
Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.520
All right. Let's also say hello, of course, to the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.040
Oh, hi, Loki. How are you?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.040
All right. Catch in the cold, but I'm all right.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.960
Oh, no, I hope it's only a cold.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.040
Let it go. You shouldn't catch it.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.720
Yeah, let it go. Let it run free.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.960
What is that that's playing behind you tonight?

02:29.960 --> 02:34.080
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice

02:34.080 --> 02:36.840
geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:37.040 --> 02:40.560
And as we tape live, you can see video of us doing this show.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.680
But of course, everything is always in the audio form for you.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.880
Find folks that listen through a podcast app such as Spotify, iTunes, whatever.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.280
Amazon Music, I think, does them now.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.960
Wherever you listen to podcasts, we're there.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.880
And but if you are watching live, you get to see some video, including whatever this is that Matt is

02:57.880 --> 03:00.160
playing that I can't tell what this is.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.000
It looks like a scary game of some sort because I think it's not.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.960
Oh, it looks like something scary is about to happen there.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.360
No, no, it's it's Bone Lab.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.560
It's it's a VR game by stress level zero.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.200
It's their sequel.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.400
It's a pretty cutting edge VR game that I need to play.

03:17.400 --> 03:23.200
I have it and I have my VR in a box, like

03:24.480 --> 03:27.480
Oculus, Rift S in a box and stuff.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.600
So I know I don't think it's too scary.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.160
There's skeletons, I guess.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.160
OK, well, as I said, a little scene that was played behind you look kind of freaky, but a little trickery for some crowds.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.400
Yeah, well, it's it's just I don't know.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.520
I think you go through I don't remember the exact premise of the game.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.760
I think you go through like different modules or whatever.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.000
There are different time periods.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.800
Oh, like quantum leap.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.080
Sort of like it looks like you're kind of like being treated like a witch here

03:53.080 --> 03:55.680
and then you fall into a dungeon, you fight, you know.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.240
Skeletons, and then there's another one, you fight like robots and stuff.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.720
Can I ask a completely fucking random question?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.520
This is Orange Lounge Radio, right?

04:04.520 --> 04:06.480
And we don't have a lot.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.680
The news this week was a little bit shorter.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.760
We can get on a tangent once in a while, right?

04:10.760 --> 04:13.040
Especially if it has to do with a video game or in this case.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.360
Why isn't there this video game?

04:15.360 --> 04:18.960
And my question is, why don't we have a quantum leap video game?

04:19.120 --> 04:20.760
How has that never happened over the years?

04:20.760 --> 04:23.680
I'm talking either because they just relaunched it, right?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.080
There's a newer version, right?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.040
It doesn't have the same actors.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.360
Well, one of them passed away.

04:28.360 --> 04:33.040
But it's it's from what I understand is a completely passable version of the show.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.240
It's not terrible, like a lot of reboots.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.440
Sounds like NBC is actually kind of getting the reboot thing

04:37.440 --> 04:39.480
because I hear the Night Court one is pretty good, too.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.200
But I understand why Night Court's not a video game.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.520
I don't understand why Quantum Leap isn't a video game.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.760
Or am I missing something from the 80s or 90s?

04:46.760 --> 04:48.640
Was there an obscure game I just didn't know about?

04:48.760 --> 04:52.400
Because I know a lot of TV like Star Trek Next Generation had a Super Nintendo game.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.520
There was a lot of stuff that had video game.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.640
I don't remember Quantum Leap ever having a video game.

04:57.320 --> 05:02.320
No, I don't think it did, but I don't know what that would be.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.360
Well, like you're like you're talking about.

05:04.360 --> 05:08.640
You're hopping into different bodies and solving different adventures like the show.

05:08.880 --> 05:13.000
Maybe they could actually do an ending that fucking doesn't just end

05:13.000 --> 05:15.560
like the original show did, you know?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.640
Looking in chat, Darticia says,

05:19.640 --> 05:22.440
Alright, also, I hear the sequel got another season.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.240
Yeah, I heard that, too.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.720
That's kind of one reason I bring it up is that, you know,

05:25.720 --> 05:29.720
a lot of those revivals of old shows, some of well, I shouldn't say a lot of them.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.920
Some of actually quite a few of them have done very well.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.840
The Roseanne without Roseanne is like still going.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.280
There's the Will and Grace was on for several seasons there.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.480
There's a lot of shows that come back and they do pretty well.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.520
But yeah, Fifth Dream says too much plot, not enough action.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.760
Maybe Questbuster with the suggestion

05:49.080 --> 05:52.320
a scum like adventure based on Quantum Leap would be neat.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.920
Now you're talking now you're talking like a more text based, not text based,

05:55.920 --> 06:02.080
but, you know, old school 90s PC, King's Quest, LucasArts, RPG in Quantum Leap.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.160
Hell yeah. Now now we're talking.

06:04.160 --> 06:08.880
Let fucking not telltale games, but I guess they are telltale games again.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.120
But the people that are making games

06:10.120 --> 06:13.120
like the old telltale games, let them do a Quantum Leap game.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.080
Hell yeah. I'd rather see that than Jurassic Park.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.600
Anyway, I don't know.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.360
I'll take I'll take a scum based Seinfeld game

06:22.640 --> 06:26.320
because I already know that someone's made that concept and it looked hilarious.

06:27.040 --> 06:31.840
Bobby Black Wolf with the realistic answer saying licensing, which, yeah,

06:31.840 --> 06:37.000
but, you know, NBC, NBC, Comcast, Universal should license more of their stuff.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.800
Isn't Jurassic Park or Universal?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.480
I guess it's based on a book, though, so maybe that one end up a little different.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.840
But hell, if you if you were to open that up, you could have a saved

06:45.840 --> 06:49.040
by the Bell video game you could have.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.800
You can have all sorts of things.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.760
Anyway, I mean, they made a high school musical game, so why not?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.600
Why not? Exactly. That's exactly my point.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.480
If these crappy things can have video games, why can't Quantum Leap?

07:01.160 --> 07:04.840
Tigerclaw points out there was an article on Eurogamer in 2021

07:04.840 --> 07:08.320
that says someone should make a game about Quantum Leap.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.680
Well, somebody and I over on that website are on the same wavelength then.

07:14.880 --> 07:19.720
All right. Let's talk about the games we know are coming out or in some cases

07:20.240 --> 07:24.080
did come out. Let's talk a little bit about that Microsoft developer direct

07:24.080 --> 07:28.160
that's kind of taken over the headlines this week as our first topic for tonight.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.960
Loki, do you want to talk about this? Did you watch it?

07:30.960 --> 07:33.880
I must admit, I was able to watch it.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.440
Just a quick aside.

07:36.440 --> 07:40.600
My dad had surgery this week, and although it went well,

07:41.160 --> 07:44.720
there was a complication that caused us to go to the ER that same night.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.680
He's fine. Everything is is but it's just it was a bumpy road to get there.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.680
So my point is I was a little removed from some of this this week

07:52.920 --> 07:54.840
and I didn't watch this live.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.920
I didn't really do catching up on gaming news

07:56.920 --> 07:58.760
until the weekend with other stuff going on.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.520
I'm sure you all can understand no one's going to fault me.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.720
But just to put that in perspective, so I didn't watch this live.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.560
I just kind of caught up on the cliff notes.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.800
I'm I'm not sure if I'm assuming Jamie doesn't usually watch

08:09.800 --> 08:12.400
the Microsoft stuff live, but Loki, I don't know if you did.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.600
I didn't watch it live.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.400
I knew it was coming and I forgot what time it was on.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.360
I watched it after part of it after the fact.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.040
Only the beginning of it.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.200
So they showed off.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.120
Was it a new trailer?

08:26.160 --> 08:27.560
It was kind of boring.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.120
It was really boring.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.440
At least this trailer was for Minecraft Legends showing off

08:32.440 --> 08:37.280
the the PvP 4v4 mode that they have, which.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.040
May. OK, cool.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.800
So there's that.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.120
And then they announced the date that's coming out, which is April 18th.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.560
So it'll be part of Game Pass.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.680
That's probably going to be the way I'll check it out.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.320
I'm not buying that it.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.880
Like I said, this has the Fallout 76

09:02.200 --> 09:04.320
feel to me, the more you wait.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.840
No, actually, it wasn't Fallout 76 Elder Scrolls Online.

09:06.840 --> 09:11.240
It was the more I saw of that game, the less I wanted to play it.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.840
And the same with Minecraft Legends.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.360
The more I see of this, the less I want to play it.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.840
It just doesn't look interesting.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.920
They had a little bit of a kind of

09:23.880 --> 09:26.280
preview of Forza Motorsports,

09:26.880 --> 09:29.400
which is, I guess, you know, kind of

09:30.360 --> 09:33.800
not incrementing the numbers anymore, kind of rebooting, I guess, if you will.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.520
And looks cool.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.120
They've, you know, really stepping up like the different physics

09:40.120 --> 09:44.600
as far as like paint and even just the, you know,

09:44.600 --> 09:48.600
car physics themselves and the damage models, dirt accumulation,

09:48.840 --> 09:52.240
like, you know, all that like intricate stuff that's just like

09:52.320 --> 09:53.680
way too detailed.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.320
But, you know, at this point, like the cars look like cars.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.600
You got to get to that in unnecessary detail.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.160
IRL stuff we take for granted.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.400
I know. Why is like realistic dirt so funny to me?

10:06.400 --> 10:08.000
I don't know why.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.600
If I want to see like blood, you know,

10:11.480 --> 10:14.960
bug splat physics and stuff like that, that's what they need to do in there.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.080
You know what would be funnier is like, I would love to see something like this,

10:18.080 --> 10:22.880
but like from like, say, a Cruzan USA game, you know, like,

10:22.880 --> 10:27.600
you know, just a ridiculous thing because Cruzan is just absolutely unrealistic.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.720
But they could talk about the physics of like the deer exploding

10:30.720 --> 10:32.320
when you hit it and stuff like that.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.240
We've made the Gibbs that much more

10:35.560 --> 10:36.800
so much more fidelity.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.160
He's some spy. What was that?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.680
What was that super realistic?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.400
Carmageddon, was that what it was called?

10:41.400 --> 10:44.840
The one that ended up on a congressman watch list and things like that.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.600
That's what you want.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.360
You want Carmageddon or something like that, don't you want a Carmageddon?

10:48.360 --> 10:51.520
But it's like, I think it would be funny to have like one of these games

10:51.520 --> 10:55.800
that's just like absolutely the total opposite side of the spectrum,

10:56.080 --> 10:59.120
like putting out a video like this, talking about the details.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.840
It's just like it'd be funny.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.000
But yeah, it looks really cool.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.440
Sick, very sick.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.560
They said it was at 20 tracks, 50 cars,

11:09.560 --> 11:13.000
800 different upgrades to those cars, something that.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.720
And then they showed off a brand new kind of a surprise game

11:17.720 --> 11:22.840
called Hi-Fi Rush, which was a rhythm focus character action game,

11:22.840 --> 11:26.720
kind of looked reminded me a little bit of Sunset Overdrive.

11:27.320 --> 11:32.480
And that was a thing that actually I believe came out that day.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.880
It sure did.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.280
So that that looked pretty cool.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.680
They talked a little bit about actually, can we go back to Hi-Fi Rush

11:38.680 --> 11:40.960
for a minute, because I actually played it a little bit.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.920
So it's it's pretty cool.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.440
It reminds me a little bit of like, I know a lot of people were

11:46.440 --> 11:50.040
comparing it to Jet Set Radio Future because of the art style

11:50.040 --> 11:51.480
and the fact that it's a music game.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.440
But the way it plays is not like that at all.

11:54.440 --> 11:58.240
I would call it Beatenetta because it's like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry,

11:58.240 --> 12:00.800
but with rewards for beat matching,

12:00.800 --> 12:04.000
which also is not particularly unique to a game.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.280
I want to say it's very I want to say this game was probably when they

12:08.280 --> 12:10.360
when they came up with coming up with this game or whatever.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.280
They were probably like, what if we did Crypt of the Necro Dancer?

12:13.480 --> 12:15.480
But we did it like Devil May Cry.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.640
And that's where this game came from, pretty much.

12:17.920 --> 12:22.000
But it's it's I mean, especially for a surprise release with no buildup.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.600
I love the art style in it is so, so good.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.560
And it actually it has a really good sense of humor.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.360
Like the voice acting in the game is really good.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.840
And it's got like a really like cute, funny plot to it.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.680
So, yeah, I'm I'm like super into this game.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.400
And it was it's for a stealth release.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.480
It's great.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.160
So it's definitely worth a look if you're like on Game Pass or whatever.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.760
And I'm glad because I know a lot of people kind of been talking about

12:47.760 --> 12:53.160
how like Game Pass is like not had stuff to look forward to

12:53.160 --> 12:55.480
or whatever for the past few months, you know,

12:55.480 --> 12:57.480
because they've been removing my Steam wish list.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.920
Yeah, but this this game is great.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.640
I think I think you might like this Dark Sakura.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.440
I think you would.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.640
Well, no, it's like I said, it's been on my Steam wish list for a while.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.200
What? This game?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.200
It just came out this week.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.720
No, it just came out this week with no fanfare.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.640
No, there was a Steam thing on there.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.160
Hold on. Maybe I'm thinking of a different one with similar graphics.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.880
It did come out on Steam, but there was no fanfare for this.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.280
They literally announced it on Wednesday or whatever.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.560
And they were like, it's out today.

13:22.560 --> 13:26.000
This game has been on my Steam wish list, not Xbox.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Nothing having to do with it.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.560
Just that I think it looks like a good game and it's on my wish list.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.880
Oh, yeah. No, that's what I was saying.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.840
Gotcha. I thought you said it had been on it.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.320
Like I was like, wait, but it's only been out. I got it.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.280
But yeah, I mean, the game is a lot of fun.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.800
And the licensed music, like it has like Nine Inch Nails,

13:44.800 --> 13:47.040
Perfect Drug, which is really cool. Love that song.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.080
You know, it's just lots of neat stuff in it.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.560
And I thought it was very smart.

13:50.560 --> 13:55.000
They did a streamer friendly mode for the game to encourage people to stream it.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.640
Everybody knows because this game is a like shadow drop release,

13:59.640 --> 14:01.360
basically unannounced comes out of nowhere.

14:01.360 --> 14:05.360
In fact, I noticed that the icon on my desktop to launch

14:05.360 --> 14:08.400
the game is still called Hibiki, which is not the name of the game.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.600
It's called Hi-Fi Rush.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.560
So I think this game was such a shadow drop with little fanfare.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.880
They accidentally left the project name or the code name in the files.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.520
It was a different game on my wish list.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.640
OK, OK.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.920
Bomb Rush Cyber Funk, which is like a Jet Set Radio clone.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.240
Oh, interesting. Yeah. Hmm.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.880
But but yeah.

14:28.880 --> 14:33.600
So Hi-Fi Rush, I absolutely would say, I mean, if you have Game Pass,

14:33.600 --> 14:37.280
this was a great little thing to sweeten the pot with this this week, that's for sure.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.520
Let's see. And oh, Mike Deft thought of it in chat, too.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.720
I was just looking at the chat here, catching up a little bit.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.560
Dr. T in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.800
I was loving Hi-Fi Rush for the most part.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.560
Then I hit a wall on one of the rhythm based sections.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.160
I wonder, I actually don't know the answer to this.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.200
Can you tone down the difficulty in the middle of it?

14:56.720 --> 14:57.960
Because I'm playing on normal,

14:57.960 --> 15:00.720
but I'm willing to drop it down to easy if I need to clear a section.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.600
So I'm not I'm not sure.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.160
Maybe so.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.680
And SSG100 Matt does point out the ever important.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.240
You get to pet the cat.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.400
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

15:10.400 --> 15:15.160
Anyway, sorry, but I just I since I did play it a little bit and I think this game.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.960
Here's the thing. Sorry, I don't mean to harp too much on this, but I think it's important.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.600
Another game with a lot of fanfare came out this week, and that's Square Enix's

15:24.600 --> 15:25.720
Fourspoken, right?

15:25.720 --> 15:28.840
They've been really putting a lot of money into promoting that.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
And they had the demo that came out.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.360
And it's been landing to mixed reviews.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.520
Now, I I don't have a horse in this race.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.640
I don't have a PS5.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.000
I can't even play it if I wanted to.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.320
I haven't played it myself.

15:40.320 --> 15:45.200
I don't know if it you know, I saw that clip float around the Internet

15:45.200 --> 15:48.120
of the scene of the voice acting that people were criticizing.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.800
And I did not think it was as bad as people were making it out to be.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.240
And I think I think there's a tell in there, but I digress.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.800
If the game is bad, the game is bad.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.480
That's, you know, the what it is at the end of the day.

15:59.320 --> 16:04.960
But I just that is a, they've been hyping it for months and months and

16:04.960 --> 16:09.360
months, $70, you know, preorder it, get it out there game.

16:09.680 --> 16:16.080
And then this shows up pretty much the same day, $30 or game pass or, you

16:16.080 --> 16:17.200
know, whatever.

16:17.720 --> 16:21.520
And you can grab it and now and now everybody's streaming this one.

16:21.800 --> 16:26.160
Whereas the other one, Square Enix is paying people to stream it.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.000
I don't think that's happening here.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.040
So it's it's a very interesting yin and yang happening this week.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.880
And again, I'm not trying to dog on the other game.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.160
I'm just saying hey, from my perspective sitting here, this is

16:38.160 --> 16:41.960
really interesting how this one is really dominating the conversation

16:41.960 --> 16:44.760
because it was a shadow release that you know, even if you don't have

16:44.760 --> 16:47.440
game pass is half as much on Steam, basically.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.560
So anyway.

16:53.920 --> 16:57.200
See other things that you talked about Elder Scrolls Online is

16:57.200 --> 16:59.360
getting yet another piece of DLC.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.560
So they are going to be introducing Necrom, which is taking place, I

17:03.560 --> 17:09.240
guess, on an Eastern Morrowind and also introducing a new class of the

17:09.240 --> 17:13.560
Arcanist and yeah, it looks pretty cool.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.040
Still, I don't know.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.960
I'm probably should give Elder Scrolls Online a try again.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.480
I've tried giving this game a try and I got, I'm not into it.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.720
Like I've tried, but maybe I, you know what?

17:25.720 --> 17:29.040
I just I'm not into the Elder Scrolls universe at all.

17:29.040 --> 17:29.520
Yeah.

17:29.520 --> 17:34.240
I mean, I don't love it as much as Alan or even like Loki probably

17:34.240 --> 17:37.560
does, but I tried to do I bought it when it first came out.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.720
Actually, when it was on the Guild Wars model where you just

17:39.720 --> 17:42.760
bought the game and no, we had a monthly fee at first, right?

17:42.760 --> 17:45.200
I think I bought the game and like paid for a month or something

17:45.200 --> 17:47.800
because I remember playing it before, but I just I couldn't

17:47.800 --> 17:48.200
get into it.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.240
But I know people that play it that really love it.

17:50.240 --> 17:58.080
So, yeah, then they showed off some gameplay of Redfall, which

17:58.080 --> 18:03.640
is their new game by Arkane Studios, Austin, and kind of

18:03.640 --> 18:06.280
a vampire FPS type thing.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.160
So they did a little bit of a deep dive there.

18:08.160 --> 18:12.160
It's supposed to be coming out May 2nd and I think that was it.

18:14.560 --> 18:19.440
Yeah, I don't know if this last game, the Redfall is super

18:19.440 --> 18:20.960
up my alley, but it looks nice.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.840
Like, you know, the artwork is very good and the graphics

18:25.840 --> 18:26.560
and all that stuff.

18:26.560 --> 18:31.160
It's, you know, it's very good looking.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.160
Arkane makes good games with Dishonored and stuff.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.200
So, I mean, yeah, it'd be worth checking out.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.200
I don't know.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.200
Yeah, we'll see.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.000
Some other comments coming into chat.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.280
QuestBuster saying I'd give ESO a try, but there's so much

18:46.280 --> 18:47.600
to get caught up on on this point.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.080
You know, there's a lot of MMOs that kind of have that problem, right?

18:50.480 --> 18:50.880
Yeah.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.960
I will say, having flirted with Warcraft again, even though

18:54.960 --> 18:58.560
my sub is gone now, but for the month or two I was playing

18:58.560 --> 19:01.440
it, I will say the catch up model they put in that game kind

19:01.440 --> 19:02.320
of works really well.

19:02.320 --> 19:06.400
Is that basically it's like for you to level from level one.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.560
No, they have a starting area that takes you from one to

19:08.560 --> 19:12.640
ten, and then you can pick any prior expansion or even float

19:12.640 --> 19:16.320
between them if you want to get from ten to, I think, 60,

19:16.320 --> 19:17.360
which was the old cap.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.920
And then you go to Dragonflight to do the new cap 60 to 70.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.840
I thought that was a smart way to do it because you can

19:21.840 --> 19:24.640
kind of taste whatever expansion you want to do, you know,

19:24.640 --> 19:25.840
and then do it that way.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.320
So and then let's see.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.280
Pelehatome on chat says I put like 100 hours into ESO and

19:31.280 --> 19:32.800
then suddenly burned out.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.960
QuestBuster says I remember being in the beta and it was

19:34.960 --> 19:37.680
in rough shape, but it's really improved from what I understand.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.800
So, yeah, some comments from chat.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.920
Now, here's my question.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.600
What did you think of the event as a whole?

19:45.600 --> 19:50.480
Because we don't usually see a lot of directs like this where

19:50.480 --> 19:54.080
it's they did a few games, and they did a real deep dive on

19:54.080 --> 19:56.960
those games and spent like seven, eight minutes on each

19:56.960 --> 20:00.480
game, as opposed to quick hit two minute trailers for a

20:00.480 --> 20:01.440
bunch of things.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.200
This was more of like a deep dive type of thing.

20:03.200 --> 20:07.120
And, you know, Bobby had a comment that is, you know, in

20:07.120 --> 20:10.000
line with where a lot of gamers are at in chat at twitch.tv

20:10.000 --> 20:13.680
slash vog network saying, we wish we got more deeper dives

20:13.680 --> 20:16.720
instead of just a pre rendered trailer does a deeper dive.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.680
Man, that was boring.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.120
Why couldn't that just been a trailer?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.480
So is this just another case of gamers?

20:22.480 --> 20:25.600
Gamers hate everything.com or what is it?

20:25.600 --> 20:27.920
I guess it depends what their expectations are.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.720
Like, I think when people hear Xbox Bethesda showcase, they

20:30.720 --> 20:34.240
think of like E3 showcase type thing when this is more in

20:34.240 --> 20:38.400
line of like, say, a state of play type thing that EA would

20:38.400 --> 20:40.480
or not EA of Sony would do or something like that.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.560
To be fair, they called it developer direct, which I don't

20:42.560 --> 20:43.760
think I've ever heard him use before.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.840
But I also completely understand.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.480
And we've talked about this before, too.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.560
Perception is everything.

20:51.280 --> 20:56.240
You can call it deep dive on four game showcase.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.960
People are still going to perceive it as something something

20:58.960 --> 21:01.840
in this industry that happens all the time, right?

21:01.840 --> 21:02.080
Yeah.

21:02.080 --> 21:02.320
Yeah.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.840
I mean, it's just like the where Nintendo come out with

21:05.840 --> 21:07.120
like their indie showcases.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.480
Like, listen, we are not showing Zelda.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.920
We're not showing Zelda.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.120
Don't expect Zelda.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.080
Zelda will not be here.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.120
We're not showing Zelda.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.120
And then, like, you know, people say, why didn't they show

21:17.120 --> 21:24.800
Zelda? Well, this might be the first E3 or that time period,

21:24.800 --> 21:28.000
summer time period where we don't get gamers that fucking

21:28.000 --> 21:31.280
say that because a Zelda game will have just come out in May.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.400
You know, someone's still going to say it, but you would be

21:34.400 --> 21:35.680
showing off a new Zelda.

21:35.680 --> 21:40.160
You would think any gamer that fucking knows anything about

21:40.160 --> 21:42.240
anything is going to be like, okay, they're not going to

21:42.240 --> 21:45.680
announce a Zelda this summer right after they just released,

21:45.680 --> 21:47.440
you know, Tears of the Kingdom.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.840
Where's my Zelda maker?

21:49.840 --> 21:51.440
Why aren't they showing Zelda maker?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.840
No, now it'll be where's Metroid Prime 4?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.120
That's going to be the new.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.080
Where's Metroid Prime?

21:58.080 --> 22:01.120
Did you know Metroid Prime 4 was rebooted four years ago?

22:01.120 --> 22:02.400
Where is Metroid Prime 4?

22:02.400 --> 22:10.080
I'm hoping that they do a remaster of 0gx, but, you know,

22:10.080 --> 22:12.320
because that's been rumored for a while now, too.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.920
Don't play with my heartstrings.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.720
Who's right now?

22:15.520 --> 22:16.160
Who's really that?

22:16.160 --> 22:19.040
Who's TikTok is rumoring that you can say anything you want

22:19.040 --> 22:19.680
on that platform.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.800
No one's going to fact check you.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.920
Literally, I swear to God.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.400
All right, so I guess that's really it for the developer

22:30.400 --> 22:35.040
recap, but is there anything that you kind of wish they'd

22:35.040 --> 22:36.480
showed that they didn't show?

22:36.480 --> 22:40.720
Like, obviously for me, you know, but I'm not saying this

22:40.720 --> 22:42.240
is a negative against Microsoft.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.920
I think they did a fine job.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.240
I think if you listen to what they said, they set the

22:46.240 --> 22:48.800
expectation where they set the expectation.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.600
I think on top of that, they shadow released a hell of a

22:51.600 --> 22:54.800
game that's now dominating the conversation this week.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.200
Like I said, even above some games that have been hyped for

22:57.200 --> 22:58.320
months and months.

22:58.320 --> 23:02.640
And I think this HiFi Rush's release is going to change the

23:02.640 --> 23:06.000
conversation on how some games are marketed.

23:06.000 --> 23:06.640
It really is.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.560
Not every game can get away with this, but this one can.

23:10.560 --> 23:14.720
By the way, can I just say how wild is it on HiFi Rush?

23:14.720 --> 23:17.760
This is specifically the studio that did, like, the Evil

23:17.760 --> 23:20.160
Within did this.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.840
Like, I'm sure there's people out there going, where's Evil

23:23.840 --> 23:24.640
Within 3?

23:24.640 --> 23:25.680
And I get it.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.080
You want sequels to the games you love.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.720
But then when you see stuff like this come out of it, it's

23:30.720 --> 23:35.440
like, okay, but isn't it cool when a studio can, like, do

23:35.440 --> 23:36.880
whatever they want to do?

23:36.880 --> 23:39.520
Because you would have had this if they just went right into

23:39.520 --> 23:41.840
making Evil Within 3, right?

23:42.960 --> 23:43.680
I guess, yeah.

23:46.320 --> 23:51.200
What I would like, I mean, like, just with Mojang, can you

23:51.200 --> 23:53.440
please show me what you're doing with Minecraft, please?

23:53.920 --> 23:54.800
Anything?

23:54.800 --> 23:58.160
Like, we've been seeing trailers for Minecraft Legends.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.400
It's like, okay, I don't want to see that.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.880
Can you show me what you're doing with mainline Minecraft?

24:02.880 --> 24:06.560
Because, like, what we get out of them lately, like, their

24:06.560 --> 24:10.080
new thing that they showed off in a snapshot is armor trims.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.760
It's literally, like, a stripe of color on armor.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.760
That they've been working on this for two years, you guys.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.360
The idea of putting a stripe on some armor, that's two years

24:21.360 --> 24:22.080
in the making.

24:22.320 --> 24:27.040
And it's like, okay, can you just show me what you're working

24:27.040 --> 24:29.440
on? Like, what is the general, like,

24:29.440 --> 24:30.560
It's Minecraft Legends.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.600
Everybody's working on that.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.360
Was it general?

24:33.360 --> 24:33.920
Oh, exactly.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.320
It was a general theme of, like,

24:36.320 --> 24:39.200
Wouldn't it just be a simple texture and color assignment?

24:39.840 --> 24:44.320
It is, but they have, it's sort of, not exactly.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.600
So it is, they have to re-basically build the way the

24:47.600 --> 24:50.560
armor is structured, like, tag-wise and everything.

24:51.120 --> 24:54.800
They have to redesign, like, the different workstations to

24:54.800 --> 24:56.400
allow for this new type of thing.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.040
They're just retooling some of that stuff.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.520
But it seems like it's such a minor thing.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.880
It's like, excuse.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.000
They spent a lot of time this week telling us about, like,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.200
how excited, and people are, some people are excited about

25:09.200 --> 25:11.120
it because, like, oh, cool, I can customize stuff.

25:11.120 --> 25:15.200
But, like, it doesn't make a huge difference.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.320
Like, it really doesn't.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.800
It's just rebalancing stuff.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.520
But if that doesn't tell me what the next update's about,

25:21.520 --> 25:23.600
it just tells me that this is a thing that they're working

25:23.600 --> 25:25.760
on that's totally independent from everything else.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.400
But we still don't know what that is because, like,

25:28.400 --> 25:32.320
we have, like, okay, there's these armor trims and we've

25:32.320 --> 25:36.960
got bookshelves and we've got camels and we've got signs

25:36.960 --> 25:41.760
that are hanging and we've got this prehistoric six-legged

25:41.760 --> 25:44.720
turtle thing that sniffs up seeds.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.280
What the heck does that have to do with anything?

25:48.240 --> 25:50.800
It's just such a random assortment of things.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.160
It's just like, here's all the stuff that we're working on

25:54.160 --> 25:56.000
that we really don't have a place to fit it.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.920
We're just going to put that all into an update.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.480
But things that are, like, people have been asking for,

26:00.480 --> 26:05.120
like stairs and slabs for concrete, for example, that is

26:05.120 --> 26:07.840
literally something that they have the model built in.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.320
They have the structures to be able to put this in the game.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.920
All they literally would have to do is create the item.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.320
The textures are already in the game.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.000
The models are in the game.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.840
It's just, it's literally setting up data.

26:20.400 --> 26:24.800
It would take one person maybe an afternoon to do that,

26:24.800 --> 26:27.600
but they don't do that because of course not.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.400
It's just weird stuff.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.280
I would have liked to have seen Fable, to be honest.

26:33.280 --> 26:33.680
Yes.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.120
That's the one I would have liked to see.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.560
But I also understand, you know, like, again, I'm not shitting

26:38.560 --> 26:39.520
on what they did show.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.000
I thought it was fine, but yeah.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.080
So, all right.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.080
This sometimes happens.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.560
While we're trying to do a show, but apparently we have

26:48.560 --> 26:49.760
breaking news that's coming in.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.640
We have breaking news right now that's coming in from the

26:52.640 --> 26:55.680
chat. Of course, it's unsourced breaking news.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.160
I'd like to know where this is coming from, but I'm trusting

26:58.160 --> 26:59.280
the person who says it.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.680
But apparently, oops, not the intro.

27:01.680 --> 27:07.200
Apparently, Alan is saying that TwitchCon 2023 is in Vegas.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.080
That that has just happened.

27:10.080 --> 27:15.520
I did not see anything on the official TwitchCon Twitter or

27:15.520 --> 27:16.880
Twitch Twitter.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.920
So source, please look at their webpage.

27:19.920 --> 27:20.560
I didn't.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.920
So maybe that's where it's coming from.

27:21.920 --> 27:22.640
But I'm just asking.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.800
I'm asking Alan where the source is.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.680
So we'll try to find that.

27:28.560 --> 27:33.280
But let's say it's true.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.440
How do you feel about that?

27:35.440 --> 27:36.640
How would you feel about a TwitchCon?

27:36.640 --> 27:37.920
It's not on their website yet.

27:37.920 --> 27:38.640
Yeah.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.560
Alan, did you get duped and share it with us?

27:42.880 --> 27:43.760
I think he did.

27:43.760 --> 27:44.720
He's not talking now.

27:46.480 --> 27:50.720
Um, no, I saw this floating around like a month ago.

27:52.320 --> 27:56.080
I mean, Vegas is a big convention town.

27:56.720 --> 28:00.480
So it wouldn't be it wouldn't exactly be surprising.

28:00.480 --> 28:05.760
I will say this Final Fantasy Fan Fest was in Vegas.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.800
They were going to move to San Diego, but that was for the

28:08.800 --> 28:10.080
2020 Fan Fest.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.160
And we all know what happened to 2020.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.240
So now they're going back to Vegas.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.880
So I mean, it you do have conventions that ping pong a

28:18.880 --> 28:22.480
little bit between like San Diego and Vegas and TwitchCon

28:22.480 --> 28:23.680
has not always been in San Diego.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.360
TwitchCon has moved around.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.720
They've gone Long Beach.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.320
They've been San Francisco.

28:28.320 --> 28:33.040
So it's plausible that they could be going to Vegas.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.800
I'm not going to believe anything until it's posted on

28:34.800 --> 28:35.760
their website.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.260
All right.

28:37.200 --> 28:41.280
So Bobby is saying allegedly, the Pasqui Hotel reservation

28:41.280 --> 28:41.920
got leaked.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.920
And that is what is leading to this wildfire.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.680
And there it is.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.760
Alan is linking us the Pasqui.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.000
Okay, so this is coming from pasqui.com.

28:51.280 --> 28:56.000
And it does say TwitchCon Las Vegas, October 20th, 2023 to

28:56.000 --> 28:59.120
October 22nd, 2023.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.960
Okay, I'm willing to give this a lot more credit now because

29:02.960 --> 29:06.320
I would not see something like this on pasqui.com.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.400
And this is not some viral site.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.200
This is, you know, a handmade site, but I would not see

29:11.200 --> 29:14.560
something like that on pasqui.com if there wasn't something

29:14.560 --> 29:15.060
to that.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.680
So interesting.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.640
But yes, Dark Soccer is probably right.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.560
You should wait for the official announcement because dates

29:22.560 --> 29:25.280
could still shift around until this is released to the public.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.280
A lot of this can still change.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.000
But thank you.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.800
This is definitely now a where there's smoke, there's fire

29:30.800 --> 29:31.680
type of situation.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.360
So interesting.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.880
I think Vegas is a great place for TwitchCon.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.200
You're not going to have the problem about hotels or trying

29:39.200 --> 29:40.560
to get around or anything like that.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.720
Vegas is built to have conventions.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.800
I would be curious where they're having it.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.120
Are they having it at the actual convention center, which

29:47.120 --> 29:47.520
is pretty big?

29:47.520 --> 29:49.200
Or are they going to have it at one of the hotel convention

29:49.200 --> 29:53.440
centers, which every hotel there is built to have a mid size

29:53.440 --> 29:54.320
to huge convention.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.840
I've been to conventions at not Treasure Island.

29:57.840 --> 29:58.320
What's the other one?

29:58.320 --> 29:58.820
Mirage.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.000
And that was actually I think they're bulldozing the Mirage

30:02.000 --> 30:03.600
though. So maybe that's not where it's going to be.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.000
Who else had Paris?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.760
The Paris had Fan Fest one year.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.720
It was pretty good.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.440
The Rio had Fan Fest a couple years.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.120
I didn't like that one because it was off the strip.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.640
That one's a little harder to get to because it's not on

30:16.640 --> 30:17.920
the same line as the rest.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.480
So interesting.

30:20.480 --> 30:20.880
Wow.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.480
Alan is saying, according to the same site, Pasqui could

30:24.480 --> 30:27.440
show up on Tuesday for that.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.240
That's wild.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.960
Yeah, I'm with Bobby.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.800
I'm going to black out the days anyway, just so I don't

30:32.800 --> 30:35.360
schedule something else.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.760
I get to do that when you go back to work.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.600
That is Halloween.

30:39.600 --> 30:43.760
And that is the season when I do a lot of hosting stuff.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.280
So we'll see what happens.

30:45.280 --> 30:45.760
Interesting.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.160
Interesting.

30:46.160 --> 30:46.480
All right.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.840
Anyway, there's your breaking news.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.480
Thank you, Alan.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.520
And thank you for sourcing that.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.160
I appreciate it.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.160
Okay, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks, the

30:54.160 --> 30:56.560
types of video games that we have been playing this week.

30:56.560 --> 30:57.680
So Dark Soccer, I'll go to you.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.560
How is your gaming week?

30:59.280 --> 31:00.880
I played Star Ocean.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.320
I've played Dead by Daylight.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.240
I finally made Eerie 1, a survivor.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.840
Um, that means I can fuck around and find out.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.160
No, I just got to fuck around.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.520
I don't care about finding out anything.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.800
I've played my stupid word game.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.360
I've been playing a lot of Midnight Suns on my own now that

31:23.360 --> 31:24.960
I'm not limited to streaming it.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.640
So that's all.

31:27.840 --> 31:30.480
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

31:31.280 --> 31:32.640
It's all Minecraft still.

31:33.360 --> 31:37.760
I finished building trees on the SMP now and basically

31:38.400 --> 31:41.280
getting footage together to edit another episode together.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.760
Although I should have done my modded series more.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.480
I suppose I've made an episode in that sooner, but whatever.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.760
Nothing matters because no one sees it.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.320
It's fine.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.120
All right, my gaming week.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.600
I pretty much already talked about one of the big new games

31:59.600 --> 32:01.280
I played this week, which is HiFi Rush.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.600
I talked about that in the earlier segment where that was

32:03.600 --> 32:08.240
relevant. Again, if the concept of a beatonetta game, Bayonetta

32:08.240 --> 32:10.560
meets a beatmatching game, if that sounds attractive to you,

32:10.560 --> 32:12.080
then you definitely should check out this game, especially

32:12.080 --> 32:12.960
if you have Game Pass.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.160
You know, it's one of those things where it's like, you're

32:14.160 --> 32:14.800
paying for Game Pass.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.080
Anyway, go check it out.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.120
As far as other games I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy

32:19.120 --> 32:20.640
XIV, still on that.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.200
I tried to get a medium house in the lottery, but I didn't

32:23.200 --> 32:24.240
win the medium house.

32:24.240 --> 32:24.880
Boo.

32:24.880 --> 32:29.200
Oh, well, I've also been playing Dead by Daylight, actually.

32:29.200 --> 32:33.200
I prestiged finally Quentin and I got his Adept.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.720
So, yeah, I did all that in one go.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.400
Thank you.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.080
Because his perks are very kind of situational.

32:40.080 --> 32:43.040
Although I like his pharmacy perk.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.840
I like that's very kind of stealthy because that's how you

32:45.840 --> 32:48.320
can go into the match without an item and still get the

32:48.320 --> 32:51.920
item. Hattie has a really good perk for flashlight bullies

32:51.920 --> 32:54.080
on the same line, but I'm more of a healer than a flash.

32:54.080 --> 32:54.400
I can't.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.800
I can't flash my save to save my life.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.960
So Hattie's perk is a pain in the ass.

32:58.960 --> 32:59.200
Yeah.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.160
So let's see, outside of Dead by Daylight, I did play one

33:04.160 --> 33:05.440
other new game this week.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.760
Let's talk about Niantic's new game that also released this

33:09.760 --> 33:10.160
week.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.120
So Niantic is the studio, of course, that brought us Pokemon

33:13.120 --> 33:13.840
Go.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.720
I've talked about other games that they've made, like Ingress,

33:16.720 --> 33:18.880
Pikmin Bloom is one I quite enjoy.

33:18.880 --> 33:23.680
And this week that same studio brought us NBA All World is

33:23.680 --> 33:24.880
the game that they came out with.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.880
And they've pretty much openly said in interviews, they're

33:28.880 --> 33:31.680
trying to go for an audience that doesn't really go for

33:31.680 --> 33:32.880
their games otherwise.

33:32.880 --> 33:37.360
That sports game fans and sports game enthusiasts and Pokemon

33:37.360 --> 33:38.960
have like a 10% overlap.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.040
I think they threw that statistic out in one of their

33:41.040 --> 33:41.680
interviews.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.000
So they're trying to reach a new audience with this NBA All

33:44.000 --> 33:44.640
World game.

33:46.160 --> 33:51.360
Basically, in the game, you can go around in the places that

33:51.360 --> 33:55.680
would normally be Pokestops would drop like items such as

33:55.680 --> 34:00.400
XP up or new shoes or a different type of basketball.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.720
And you also encounter players in the wild like they're

34:04.720 --> 34:05.280
Pokemon.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.560
That's the funniest part is that NBA players are now Pokemon.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.120
So you encounter them in the wild and you basically it's

34:11.120 --> 34:13.120
literally 1v1 me, bro.

34:13.120 --> 34:13.920
That's what you do.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.640
But it's a little more intricate of a game than in Pokemon

34:16.640 --> 34:19.040
Go, how you just throw the ball and try to catch it.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.600
In this one, you might do a shot drill like who can get the

34:21.600 --> 34:23.120
most shots and so forth.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.440
You might do it around the world type of thing.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.560
Or you might actually do like a 1v1 type of minigame.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.680
And this is also what you do when you want to take control

34:31.680 --> 34:35.360
of the court, which is akin to Pokemon Go's gyms.

34:36.080 --> 34:40.160
Now, because the Niantic Wayfarer and Waypoint and the

34:40.160 --> 34:43.840
database of all their points of interest is pretty robust

34:43.840 --> 34:44.720
at this point.

34:44.720 --> 34:48.480
They've actually made it so that actual basketball courts,

34:48.480 --> 34:50.960
whether they're at your public park or wherever they are,

34:50.960 --> 34:54.160
actual basketball courts are basketball courts in the game.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.800
And you basically fight to take control of them.

34:57.760 --> 35:02.400
However, the basketball courts are occupied by bots at the

35:02.400 --> 35:05.520
beginning of the week, and you want to be there longer than

35:05.520 --> 35:06.560
anybody else.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.040
So if you want to be at the top of the board, you have to

35:09.040 --> 35:13.120
dethrone 10 bots to do it.

35:14.640 --> 35:15.440
Here's the thing.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.920
There's a lot about NBA World conceptually that I like.

35:19.920 --> 35:24.400
I think they did take the Pokemon Go formula and tried to

35:24.400 --> 35:27.840
make it a little more attractive to an audience that isn't

35:27.840 --> 35:30.800
interested in Pokemon Go otherwise, like sports game fans,

35:30.800 --> 35:31.840
like I get what they're going for.

35:32.800 --> 35:38.640
But for this game, unlike Pokemon Go, unlike Pikmin, I feel

35:38.640 --> 35:42.400
like the places of interest and the AR gaming element is

35:42.480 --> 35:46.480
secondary to the basketball game that you play in it, which

35:46.480 --> 35:48.720
to some people would be a very attractive point.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.760
I get that.

35:49.760 --> 35:56.240
But that also means that the basketball game in it has to

35:56.240 --> 35:56.740
be good.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.800
And the little mini basketball game that you play in it to

36:00.800 --> 36:05.600
take control of a court, it gets repetitive real fast.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.960
Do you throw the basket or the ball in the basket like the

36:08.960 --> 36:09.760
Pokeballs?

36:09.760 --> 36:11.280
No, it's not anything like that.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.320
Basically, it's you versus another player.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.600
It's a bot, really.

36:17.600 --> 36:21.040
And you can move left or right and you can tap to juke or

36:21.040 --> 36:23.360
you can hold to move, basically.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.680
And then you kind of do that or you can move forward.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.840
And if you get close to the basket, your character will try

36:27.840 --> 36:29.040
to slam dunk it.

36:29.040 --> 36:33.440
Or you can do like a shot thing from the three point range

36:33.440 --> 36:36.080
where a little meter goes up and down and you try to release

36:36.080 --> 36:37.360
it right at the point.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.760
And if the other player didn't block, then you might score.

36:41.520 --> 36:45.280
It's a very rudimentary, like old school 90s type of

36:45.280 --> 36:48.720
basketball game, I guess, which is fine.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.640
But I'm just going to be completely honest.

36:50.640 --> 36:54.000
It sucks to play on a cell phone because we're back in the

36:54.000 --> 36:58.880
classic problem, the classic problem that Niantic ought to

36:58.880 --> 37:01.280
know better when it comes to developing cell phone games,

37:01.280 --> 37:03.600
because they've been one of the only successful developers

37:03.600 --> 37:04.960
to buck the trend.

37:04.960 --> 37:08.080
And that is when you make a cell phone game, you want to

37:08.080 --> 37:11.360
make you experience that's uniquely cell phone.

37:11.360 --> 37:15.600
You don't want to shoehorn a console experience into a

37:15.600 --> 37:16.720
mobile game.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.600
That's the biggest problem with NBA All World.

37:19.600 --> 37:24.720
It is a mediocre at best, really repetitive basketball

37:24.720 --> 37:28.160
game that honestly ends up not being fun to play after a

37:28.160 --> 37:30.960
certain amount of time because you're trying to move left

37:30.960 --> 37:32.080
or no, I'm trying to juke.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.200
Oops, I moved.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.720
Oh, it thought my tap was a hold.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.360
It controls like ass.

37:40.240 --> 37:44.800
So I like a lot of cell phone games that aren't

37:44.800 --> 37:47.120
intentionally meant to be cell phone games kind of do.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.760
Like, I don't know why this game doesn't control better.

37:49.760 --> 37:50.880
It's not fun to play.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.680
I'm trying to have faith because a lot of the Niantic

37:55.680 --> 37:57.440
games have gotten better with time.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.280
I think Pikmin Bloom a year on is in a way better place

38:01.280 --> 38:02.880
than it even was when it launched.

38:02.880 --> 38:06.080
Pokemon Go has grown a lot in the years it's been out.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.360
Some would say for the worse.

38:07.360 --> 38:12.720
But when you consider year zero to, like, let's say right

38:12.720 --> 38:16.960
before the pandemic, if you compare 2016 Pokemon Go to 2020

38:16.960 --> 38:19.360
early 2020 Pokemon Go, I think you'd go, yeah, this game is

38:19.360 --> 38:21.120
a lot better than it was when it first came out.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.040
Some of the changes they've made since then, I understand

38:23.040 --> 38:24.240
where people are upset.

38:24.240 --> 38:28.320
I think NBA All World, if it doesn't really start to mix

38:28.320 --> 38:31.920
up that experience and maybe have there be more of a point

38:31.920 --> 38:35.440
to the AR end of things, I think it's going to fizzle out

38:35.440 --> 38:35.920
real quick.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.120
Sorry to say, because I want to support the Niantic stuff.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.920
I love AR games, but I'm not going to make believe that I

38:41.920 --> 38:44.640
enjoy this game more than I actually do, which is I don't

38:44.640 --> 38:47.920
really feel like playing that fucking 1v1 game 10 times

38:47.920 --> 38:50.400
while standing at the basketball court in the park just

38:50.400 --> 38:52.960
to get some extra items that are probably going to fall out

38:52.960 --> 38:55.680
of my inventory anyway, because the inventory system in the

38:55.680 --> 38:59.040
game is laughably limited.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.400
Laughably.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.840
Like, what?

39:03.120 --> 39:06.800
It's a cheap money grab to try to get you to expand your

39:06.800 --> 39:08.320
bag space right off the bat.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.560
When the initial release of the game, and I think it might

39:10.560 --> 39:13.680
have fixed it since then, doesn't even warn you that you're

39:13.680 --> 39:14.880
about to hit the cap.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.760
Oh, by the way, if you try to claim items from an achievement,

39:17.760 --> 39:19.840
those items go straight in the garbage.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.240
You don't even have a chance to say, oh, let me get rid of

39:22.240 --> 39:24.800
something else so I can claim these more rare items from an

39:24.800 --> 39:25.440
achievement.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.040
That really ticked me off.

39:27.040 --> 39:31.040
So that part of it, like, yikes.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.000
So do I recommend the NBA All World?

39:34.000 --> 39:34.640
Not right now.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.920
But maybe in a few months, unless you, like, love basketball.

39:39.920 --> 39:44.560
And look, I promise you what I'm saying about this game does

39:44.560 --> 39:48.080
not come from a place of, oh, Rob doesn't play sports games.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.880
I guarantee those of you that are into sports games are going

39:50.880 --> 39:52.880
to have the same impressions I had of this.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.040
And I don't hate sports games just because they're sports

39:55.040 --> 39:55.360
games.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.960
In fact, I actually rather like a lot of the arcadey type

39:58.960 --> 40:00.000
of sports games.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.080
If the 1v1 mode was like NBA Jam, but actually controlled

40:04.080 --> 40:06.400
well on a phone, I'd fucking be into that.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.120
I sure would.

40:08.240 --> 40:08.880
But it's not.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.320
It's boring.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.280
So there you go.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.720
That's my review of NBA All World.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.160
ZenMonkey11 says it controls like ass.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.200
Should be in a game review.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.960
If they want to put that on the store, that's fine.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.720
Bobby Black Wolf says, yeah, it's interesting to see that

40:24.720 --> 40:27.600
some kids can only use touch screen technology, either

40:27.600 --> 40:30.400
tablets or phones, put them in front of a keyboard and mouse,

40:30.400 --> 40:31.440
and they freeze up.

40:31.440 --> 40:34.880
I would be shocked if even a child could do what they wanted

40:34.880 --> 40:35.920
to do in this game.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.160
Again, I'm telling you, I'm tapping to juke.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.280
Oops, I moved.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.960
Like, who thought that was a good idea?

40:42.640 --> 40:47.680
Anyway, SG100Matt says I'm waiting for NHL World where

40:47.680 --> 40:49.680
the gameplay is NHL 94.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.280
Well, if the game does well, I'm sure they'll try to partner

40:53.280 --> 40:54.560
with other sports things.

40:54.640 --> 40:59.840
I would be curious what you get at NBA All World if you go

40:59.840 --> 41:04.880
to the actual Golden One Center, which is, you know, I walk

41:04.880 --> 41:05.760
downtown all the time.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.120
I walk by Golden One Center and I know the actual NBA arenas

41:09.120 --> 41:12.080
are like they're programmed to something different in the

41:12.080 --> 41:13.840
game. So I don't know.

41:13.840 --> 41:17.600
Will we get to see the beam, which is the big new thing in

41:17.600 --> 41:18.880
Sacramento when the Kings win?

41:18.880 --> 41:20.480
Light the beam, light the beam.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.600
This is big purple beam.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.280
They shoot up in the sky whenever the Kings win.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.800
We don't get to see it that often, huh?

41:27.600 --> 41:32.000
Actually, the Kings are having a better year than usual.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.960
Like, they're like number three in the league right now.

41:34.960 --> 41:42.080
It's the beam brought them alien space powers that they

41:42.080 --> 41:43.200
didn't otherwise have.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.400
Okay, there it is.

41:46.400 --> 41:46.880
All right.

41:46.880 --> 41:52.800
Anyway, of all the sports balls, basketball is probably

41:52.880 --> 41:55.040
basketball and hockey are definitely my two favorites out

41:55.040 --> 41:55.840
of all the sports balls.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.000
I'm going to go with baseball and rugby.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.520
All right, let's move on.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.280
We'll get into some news.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.160
Let's get into what else happened in the gaming world this

42:06.160 --> 42:07.040
week. We'll go to Loki.

42:08.320 --> 42:08.820
Yep.

42:09.440 --> 42:14.400
So we had a story about League of Legends source code being

42:14.400 --> 42:19.280
hacked. So apparently it is being held ransom right now.

42:19.520 --> 42:22.640
They said that over the weekend, our analysis confirmed

42:22.640 --> 42:27.760
source code for League TFT and Legacy anti-cheat platform

42:27.760 --> 42:31.600
were exfiltrated by the attackers.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.480
Today we received the ransom email.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.000
Needless to say, we won't pay.

42:38.080 --> 42:38.580
Okay.

42:40.880 --> 42:43.760
And they haven't said that right now.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.720
No player data or personal information have been taken.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.560
But they said that the attack would slow down the release

42:50.560 --> 42:52.560
of upcoming patches of its game.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.400
Yeah, because somebody could use that source code pretty

42:56.400 --> 42:59.280
dangerously to make cheats and things for the game.

42:59.280 --> 43:02.080
League of Legends is very well known as a competitive type

43:02.080 --> 43:02.580
of game.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.680
Exploiting the source code for more accurate and under

43:07.680 --> 43:08.960
the radar type of cheats.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.840
That can be a very dangerous and deadly thing for League

43:11.840 --> 43:12.400
of Legends.

43:12.960 --> 43:13.200
Right.

43:14.080 --> 43:17.360
Since the attack, we've been working to assess its impact

43:17.360 --> 43:20.960
on anti-cheat and it'll be prepared to deploy fixes as quickly

43:20.960 --> 43:22.240
as possible if needed.

43:23.440 --> 43:23.680
Yeah.

43:23.680 --> 43:26.800
I mean, considering they have the source for the anti-cheat

43:26.800 --> 43:27.300
as well.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.400
Well, I guess they're Legacy anti-cheat.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.400
Well, good job, hackers.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.000
Now they're going to have to put Denuvo in it.

43:34.000 --> 43:34.720
So good job.

43:34.720 --> 43:35.760
I'm just kidding.

43:35.760 --> 43:36.080
Please.

43:36.080 --> 43:36.480
Not bad.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.040
Yeah, but that's well, I mean, kudos to them.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.560
Putting their foot down and basically saying no, like we're

43:46.560 --> 43:49.600
not, like we're not giving into ransom period and like making

43:49.600 --> 43:50.640
that very explicit.

43:50.640 --> 43:54.400
I mean, that's, it's a dangerous thing to do because I'm

43:54.400 --> 43:56.080
sure that they'll just put it out.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.240
Like, you know, they've got nothing to lose in that situation.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.960
Yeah, or someone will leak the source code.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.360
Then if they figure they can't get any money from it, they'll

44:03.360 --> 44:04.400
just put it public.

44:04.400 --> 44:07.760
I'm sure everybody will have access to their anti-cheat stuff.

44:07.760 --> 44:08.260
Yeah.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.840
So yeah, I was gonna say the worst that can happen, the

44:11.840 --> 44:13.120
anti-cheat stuff happens.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.000
You could also, I mean, if the source code were to get out

44:16.000 --> 44:18.480
there, then hypothetically, people could kind of make their

44:18.480 --> 44:20.160
own League of Legends leagues.

44:20.720 --> 44:23.280
It would be frozen in time, so to speak, you know, it would

44:23.280 --> 44:26.400
never get updated again, but you could use the current state

44:26.400 --> 44:28.960
of the source code to basically make like a League of Legends

44:28.960 --> 44:31.520
that would run on a different server set, right?

44:31.520 --> 44:34.640
If, if that, for all I know, you know, hackers going to hack

44:34.640 --> 44:36.640
that already exists for all I know, right?

44:36.640 --> 44:38.560
Private servers for MMOs, right?

44:38.560 --> 44:41.440
We know things like, you know, back in the day, Phantasy

44:41.440 --> 44:45.600
Star Online, Blue Burst, and all that had fucking private

44:45.600 --> 44:46.240
servers.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.280
Wow, had private servers.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.640
Eleven still has private servers.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.160
I'm sure 14 has private servers.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.360
I just don't know about them.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.120
You know, most MMOs have private servers.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.600
I'm sure League of Legends is actually probably no different.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.760
I'm just not embedded in the community enough to know about

44:59.760 --> 45:02.960
them, but this is going to make that a lot stronger too in

45:02.960 --> 45:04.240
that whole scene.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.360
But I mean, if League of Legends is a really competitive

45:07.440 --> 45:10.000
game, this might also be one of those, if a tree falls in

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
the middle of the woods, does anyone actually hear it?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.800
Because if you're the king of the hill on a private server,

45:14.800 --> 45:15.280
who cares?

45:15.280 --> 45:16.560
It's not the real deal, right?

45:17.440 --> 45:20.080
It matters to those people on the private server, but not

45:20.080 --> 45:22.880
to the League community as a whole, likely.

45:22.880 --> 45:26.400
Again, I'm not super embedded in the League community, so

45:26.400 --> 45:29.680
I can't profess to know, but I would imagine that it doesn't

45:29.680 --> 45:31.840
really matter if you're king of the hill on a private server.

45:33.520 --> 45:35.440
Anyway, all right.

45:36.400 --> 45:42.160
Maybe a game that you will be more competitive on that will

45:42.160 --> 45:46.000
get people to notice would be Advance Wars, the remake, if

45:46.000 --> 45:47.760
this ever actually comes out.

45:47.760 --> 45:52.400
But it does seem like a recent listing for Walmart, and it

45:52.400 --> 45:53.040
doesn't end there.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.080
Best Buy, Amazon Canada, EB Games.

45:56.080 --> 46:00.720
They are now relisting Advance Wars 1 plus 2 reboot.

46:00.720 --> 46:03.040
You may remember this collection was originally announced

46:03.040 --> 46:06.080
for the Nintendo Switch, and then it was bumped back.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.880
It was originally announced in December 2021, but it was

46:08.880 --> 46:12.480
pushed back indefinitely because of Russia's military invasion

46:12.480 --> 46:16.560
of Ukraine, and some of the storyline in Advance Wars hits

46:16.560 --> 46:19.440
a little close to home with that whole topic.

46:19.440 --> 46:22.080
So for the game to have come out when it was originally

46:22.080 --> 46:24.960
scheduled, Nintendo felt, reading the room, that it would

46:24.960 --> 46:26.000
have been in poor taste.

46:26.720 --> 46:30.000
Even though that conflict is still going on a year from now,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.360
perhaps Nintendo is reading the room that people are just

46:33.360 --> 46:37.520
immune to it now, or they're not going to feel it's in poor

46:37.520 --> 46:38.960
taste or whatever it is.

46:40.080 --> 46:43.040
They're possibly going to be releasing the game sooner if

46:43.040 --> 46:45.520
these retail listings are to be believed.

46:46.560 --> 46:49.680
It's showing up at the retail sites, but we don't know when.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.120
I'm not seeing a win on these sites, just that the entry is

46:53.120 --> 46:56.320
showing back up on these sites, which would indicate that a

46:56.320 --> 46:58.880
release is coming in the somewhat near future.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.960
It could be something that's all the way at the holiday, for

47:00.960 --> 47:01.460
all we know.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.120
It could be a stealth release during the next Nintendo Direct.

47:05.120 --> 47:07.600
It could be a lot of things, so you just have to wait and

47:07.600 --> 47:08.320
see, I suppose.

47:09.200 --> 47:12.080
DarkTitsia in chat says, I'd imagine Nintendo's first direct

47:12.080 --> 47:15.520
of 2023 might give us the date for Advance Wars 1 and 2,

47:15.520 --> 47:17.920
especially if we're seeing these listings all pop up.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.800
Yes, probably that or E3, I imagine.

47:23.040 --> 47:28.560
And when I say E3, E3 means not just actual E3 because we

47:28.560 --> 47:30.480
really don't know what that's going to look like this year.

47:30.480 --> 47:34.080
I use E3 on this show now to mean the summer announcement

47:34.080 --> 47:37.040
period, and not E3 included.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.880
Summer Game Fest, all of it, June.

47:40.240 --> 47:43.040
sj100matt says, I've been excited for this Advance Wars

47:43.040 --> 47:46.160
reboot, but yeah, totally get why they delayed it.

47:46.160 --> 47:50.160
sj100matt, do you think it matters now?

47:50.160 --> 47:52.560
Do you think people are going to say, oh, and I open this up

47:52.560 --> 47:56.800
to anyone, not just Matt, that oh, now, even though there's

47:56.800 --> 48:00.640
still a war going on that Russia did start with Ukraine,

48:00.640 --> 48:01.680
it's not finished.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.640
In fact, it's only getting more complicated, actually.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.400
But just due to the length of time, we just don't care now?

48:08.960 --> 48:09.600
I'd be curious.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.040
sj100matt does say, I do wonder how much additional polish

48:15.040 --> 48:17.200
they've done with it being delayed a year.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.840
Part of me hopes they balance things because the game was

48:19.840 --> 48:21.360
pretty unbalanced to some points.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.280
You know, that's another pretty good point, though, is that

48:23.920 --> 48:28.960
this delay has allowed them to go back and, you know, polish

48:28.960 --> 48:31.680
things up a little bit, get the dirt off the car, so to speak,

48:32.560 --> 48:35.440
with the game and release it in a tip top shape.

48:35.440 --> 48:36.560
It'd be interesting.

48:36.560 --> 48:36.960
We'll see.

48:39.280 --> 48:42.480
Matt goes on to continue, I think the blow has been softened.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.960
Does it make it any less right in the scope of things,

48:44.960 --> 48:46.240
releasing it out?

48:46.240 --> 48:47.760
Yeah, or releasing it now?

48:47.760 --> 48:51.680
Yeah, I mean, for me, like, it's not like Nintendo started

48:51.680 --> 48:53.200
the situation that's going on.

48:53.200 --> 48:57.760
You know, sometimes art imitates life in unintended ways.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.680
And I don't think anybody's going to go, God, Nintendo,

49:01.680 --> 49:03.440
what a tacky ass thing to do, right?

49:03.440 --> 49:08.160
Well, actually, the way social media is these days, maybe.

49:08.960 --> 49:13.680
They put out Call of Duty Modern Warfare, so Modern Warfare 2,

49:13.680 --> 49:15.920
so I don't really think that, you know...

49:17.280 --> 49:20.640
If anyone critically thinks about it for a few moments,

49:20.640 --> 49:23.040
they'll realize this is a remake of a game that was out

49:23.040 --> 49:25.360
a long time ago before any of this.

49:25.360 --> 49:28.080
So, and as Joe and Hunter Matt points out, other war games

49:28.080 --> 49:30.080
have come out since the conflict has started.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.640
So, all right, moving on.

49:32.640 --> 49:34.320
Let's go to a different type of game.

49:34.320 --> 49:34.960
Dark Sakura.

49:36.880 --> 49:43.440
For people who are into leaked footage, over 10 minutes of

49:44.400 --> 49:48.720
some early Horizon multiplayer gameplay has been leaked

49:48.720 --> 49:49.360
on Reddit.

49:49.920 --> 49:53.520
Funny enough, they said that the post was deleted,

49:53.520 --> 49:57.120
but on the link that I clicked, I could still see it,

49:57.120 --> 49:58.720
even though it said deleted post.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.960
But they said that the footage is from an old alpha build

50:02.960 --> 50:08.000
from summer 2020 that was the Horizon Forbidden West alpha

50:09.040 --> 50:10.880
that was, you know, going around.

50:12.320 --> 50:16.320
And another person who actually had knowledge of the project

50:16.400 --> 50:19.440
believed that the footage and art was authentic.

50:21.920 --> 50:25.600
Guerrilla did confirm in December they're planning to,

50:25.600 --> 50:28.880
and I quote, expand the world of Horizon with an online co-op

50:28.880 --> 50:32.640
with a cast of new characters, and that they were planning

50:32.640 --> 50:35.120
for a trilogy of Horizon games.

50:35.120 --> 50:41.680
So it's not unbelievable what this footage might be,

50:41.680 --> 50:43.360
which by the way, I did save it.

50:44.160 --> 50:51.760
But I mean, I don't know why the alpha footage would cause

50:51.760 --> 50:56.160
such a big deal, but it has to be from concepts that are

50:56.160 --> 50:58.640
going to be coming out or, you know, company secrets.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.400
I don't know, but it looks good.

51:00.400 --> 51:01.520
It looks pretty.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.760
I'm also choosing not to play it now in case there are

51:03.760 --> 51:04.960
takedown requests going on.

51:04.960 --> 51:08.800
I don't want to jeopardize the archive, but it's on the

51:08.800 --> 51:10.000
Internet. It's out there.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.600
If you know where to look, you'll find it.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.360
Find it eventually.

51:14.320 --> 51:17.440
But I liked Horizon.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.960
I haven't played Forbidden West yet.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.400
I keep waiting to get a PS5.

51:20.400 --> 51:25.040
But actually, quick aside, PS5s are showing up in the wild.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.960
I keep saying I'm not going to get one until I can walk

51:26.960 --> 51:27.920
into Target and buy one.

51:27.920 --> 51:28.640
Well, guess what?

51:28.640 --> 51:31.840
I checked the Target app the other day and PS5s are, like,

51:31.840 --> 51:35.840
in stock locally, but not at the one I usually shop at.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.240
So that saved me so far.

51:38.240 --> 51:40.080
But now I'm also at the point.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.360
Have you all heard those rumors?

51:41.920 --> 51:43.760
A refresh in April or so.

51:44.560 --> 51:48.240
Now I'm kind of like, I don't want to get one until, like,

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
the game I have to play is out.

51:52.080 --> 51:52.480
Yeah.

51:52.480 --> 51:54.880
Bobby says, I just heard Rob moving the goalpost.

51:54.880 --> 51:55.680
Absolutely.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.560
You did.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.360
Absolutely.

51:57.360 --> 51:57.840
You did.

51:57.840 --> 52:01.200
Because if I don't move the goalpost, I'm going to tell you

52:01.200 --> 52:02.240
what's going to happen.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.640
I'm going to go buy one of those things at Target tomorrow.

52:04.640 --> 52:07.600
And then literally the next day, Sony's going to be like,

52:07.600 --> 52:10.240
we're doing a direct and we're announcing the PS5 slim.

52:11.040 --> 52:14.960
There's also keep in mind the whole smoke there's fire things.

52:15.600 --> 52:18.400
Haven't they already identified that there's a disk drive

52:18.400 --> 52:21.040
available out in the wild that's meant to be sold separately

52:21.040 --> 52:22.640
with a possible digital refresh?

52:22.640 --> 52:25.200
Because the disk drive doesn't work with the current digital

52:25.200 --> 52:26.240
only system.

52:26.240 --> 52:28.480
So something's being cooked up out there.

52:29.760 --> 52:32.880
The question is, is it before Final Fantasy 16?

52:32.880 --> 52:34.160
Or is it a holiday release?

52:35.600 --> 52:36.100
We'll see.

52:36.100 --> 52:40.500
Didier Ramirez says, I'll preorder Final Fantasy 7 Remake

52:40.500 --> 52:43.460
part two, but I'll still wait on the PlayStation 5 Remake.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.660
Yeah, that's going to be another.

52:44.660 --> 52:48.660
Like, is Final Fantasy 7 Re...

52:48.660 --> 52:49.700
I forgot the name of it.

52:49.700 --> 52:50.740
Not remake, but Re...

52:52.180 --> 52:53.700
What's the second part called?

52:53.700 --> 52:54.740
Not recoded.

52:54.740 --> 52:55.240
Re...

52:55.620 --> 52:56.420
Revolution.

52:56.980 --> 52:58.020
What is it called?

52:58.020 --> 53:00.580
The second part of the remake has a subtitle.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.740
Is that this holiday as well?

53:05.700 --> 53:06.980
Is it Rebirth?

53:06.980 --> 53:07.300
That's it.

53:07.300 --> 53:07.620
Thank you.

53:07.620 --> 53:08.120
Rebirth.

53:10.020 --> 53:14.980
Oh, which is I'm trying not to spoil for those that still

53:14.980 --> 53:16.980
haven't played the Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

53:16.980 --> 53:20.820
But like, Rebirth is a very appropriate subtitle.

53:20.820 --> 53:21.220
Just saying.

53:21.220 --> 53:24.820
Have not played through all of it yet, but it's fine.

53:24.820 --> 53:25.380
It's fine.

53:25.380 --> 53:30.020
It's my own fault if I get spoiled for me at this point.

53:30.020 --> 53:31.620
Because I'm about to blurt it out.

53:31.620 --> 53:32.340
But I'm not going to.

53:32.340 --> 53:33.540
I don't care.

53:33.540 --> 53:35.540
But one of these days, it's just going to fall out my mouth.

53:36.260 --> 53:36.760
All right.

53:37.700 --> 53:38.200
Anyway.

53:38.980 --> 53:39.220
Yeah.

53:39.220 --> 53:41.700
Oh, Rama says they did say Winter 2023.

53:41.700 --> 53:42.500
Holy moly.

53:42.500 --> 53:43.060
That'll be...

53:43.060 --> 53:45.540
Oh, this is going to be such a big year for games.

53:47.540 --> 53:48.340
All right.

53:48.340 --> 53:51.700
Anyway, unfortunately, even though we are looking at a very

53:51.700 --> 53:56.100
big year in games, this story is having a part two this week,

53:56.100 --> 53:57.620
which is unfortunate, right, Loki?

53:58.420 --> 53:58.660
Yeah.

53:58.660 --> 54:00.660
So more layoffs in the...

54:01.300 --> 54:05.860
Well, in this case, it's the games journalism portion

54:05.860 --> 54:07.460
of the industry.

54:07.460 --> 54:12.980
So the Washington Post was visited by CEO, entrepreneur,

54:12.980 --> 54:16.020
born in 1964, Jeffrey Bezos.

54:16.020 --> 54:18.660
And he came in and said, uh-uh, we're not doing no more

54:18.660 --> 54:19.460
gaming anymore.

54:19.460 --> 54:20.180
We're down to that.

54:20.740 --> 54:21.860
We're print media.

54:21.860 --> 54:25.460
And obviously behind the times with stuff.

54:25.460 --> 54:30.580
So they laid off a good portion of the staff, including

54:30.580 --> 54:34.420
what they said, 30 vacancies, and that will go unfulfilled

54:34.420 --> 54:36.980
and 20 staff who no longer have jobs.

54:38.580 --> 54:41.380
And so they're saying that they're going to be cutting

54:42.900 --> 54:43.860
different sections out.

54:43.860 --> 54:46.340
But yeah, the gaming section would be one that is...

54:46.340 --> 54:47.540
Why doesn't he cut his salary?

54:50.500 --> 54:51.000
That...

54:51.940 --> 54:53.780
He needs his billions of dollars.

54:53.780 --> 54:54.820
No, he doesn't.

54:54.820 --> 54:55.460
I'm sorry.

54:55.460 --> 54:58.580
When he comes out and says we're a print journalism.

54:58.580 --> 55:00.020
Look, I understand.

55:00.020 --> 55:01.220
I respect.

55:01.220 --> 55:03.860
Print is a great thing to have in your hands and so forth.

55:03.860 --> 55:06.020
But it's very not forward thinking.

55:06.020 --> 55:07.060
Bobby had a comment.

55:07.060 --> 55:09.140
It was actually on a different story.

55:09.140 --> 55:10.100
Here it is.

55:10.100 --> 55:13.380
Bobby said earlier in chat, yeah, it's interesting to see

55:13.380 --> 55:17.300
that some kids can only use touchscreen technology, either

55:17.300 --> 55:19.460
tablets or phones, put them in front of a keyboard and mouse

55:19.460 --> 55:20.420
and they freeze up.

55:20.420 --> 55:24.740
I've seen some babies toddlers try to swipe and zoom a

55:24.740 --> 55:25.380
magazine.

55:29.220 --> 55:32.180
Yeah, I've seen the stories too and talking about like, even

55:32.180 --> 55:38.260
like, people of like, this generation who are now getting

55:38.260 --> 55:41.780
into the workforce who have never had computers and stuff

55:41.780 --> 55:44.820
being confused, basically being like kind of how we would

55:44.820 --> 55:49.060
see, oh, hey, that those those older people at the job.

55:49.060 --> 55:51.300
They don't know anything about computers and stuff.

55:51.300 --> 55:52.900
But it's like that now.

55:52.900 --> 55:54.820
I don't know if that's necessarily the same, though.

55:54.820 --> 55:59.940
Like, I know my kids are working with, like, net, not net

55:59.940 --> 56:02.740
books, but they have like Chromebooks and stuff in school.

56:03.380 --> 56:05.540
And I mean, obviously, I'm doing the right thing by raising

56:05.540 --> 56:06.420
them with computers.

56:06.420 --> 56:10.020
But like, yeah, they don't know how to troubleshoot things

56:10.020 --> 56:14.500
like I used to know, because, you know, growing up on a 286

56:14.500 --> 56:16.340
or what, I don't know if that was a 286.

56:16.340 --> 56:19.140
But old computer DOS.

56:19.140 --> 56:22.340
Sometimes those Chromebooks feel like 286 is just to be

56:22.340 --> 56:24.180
clear, they run just as fast.

56:26.100 --> 56:28.260
It's hard to believe that they're actually faster than

56:28.260 --> 56:33.700
that. No, it's, it's like, you know, you don't, you're not

56:33.700 --> 56:37.300
forced to critically, like, solve those problems and stuff.

56:37.300 --> 56:40.180
And so yeah, it's like, you're not going to have those skills.

56:40.180 --> 56:42.580
And honestly, that really does help me in my day to day

56:42.580 --> 56:45.620
stuff. Like, I can, I can critically solve a lot of problems

56:45.620 --> 56:48.180
and technical stuff that nobody else can.

56:48.180 --> 56:50.900
You need to get those kiddos on PC building simulator,

56:50.900 --> 56:53.140
Prompto, Prompto, you need to get them.

56:53.140 --> 56:54.420
I think they have it.

56:54.420 --> 56:56.820
It's just, you know, it's not a fun game they won't play.

56:58.900 --> 57:01.620
No, there's, you know, I don't know, but they know how to,

57:01.620 --> 57:03.060
like, at least use a computer.

57:03.620 --> 57:06.020
My son even accidentally updated to Windows 11.

57:06.020 --> 57:09.540
So I mean, like, he's, they know what they're doing somewhat.

57:10.180 --> 57:14.820
But it's, yeah, I do find it weird that there's people that

57:14.820 --> 57:18.420
don't understand how to do certain things in the workplace,

57:18.420 --> 57:22.500
or like, even just like, regular adults, like, like, like,

57:22.500 --> 57:27.060
our jobs, like most most office jobs, like require knowledge

57:27.060 --> 57:30.020
of Microsoft, the Microsoft Office products, you know, like,

57:30.020 --> 57:31.300
you should know how to use Excel.

57:32.020 --> 57:33.780
There are people that have been in like, some of these

57:33.780 --> 57:36.340
companies for years that don't know how to use Excel.

57:36.340 --> 57:38.660
And I'm like, how do you not know how to use Excel?

57:38.660 --> 57:41.540
It is literally one of the job requirements.

57:41.540 --> 57:44.660
You literally have had training on it multiple times.

57:45.540 --> 57:46.900
How do you not know how to do this?

57:47.620 --> 57:49.380
Because they don't want to know how to do it.

57:49.380 --> 57:49.860
Exactly.

57:49.860 --> 57:50.580
There's a lot of-

57:50.580 --> 57:52.900
And they think that if they don't learn how to do it,

57:52.900 --> 57:54.500
someone else will do it for them.

57:54.500 --> 57:55.940
And that's what ends up happening.

57:55.940 --> 57:59.860
And that person is unfortunately me.

57:59.860 --> 58:04.500
It's called, I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts

58:04.500 --> 58:07.220
where they were talking about willful stupidity or willful

58:07.220 --> 58:10.740
ignorance like that, where it's easier to say, I don't know

58:10.740 --> 58:13.700
how to do something and feign it, even if they know how to

58:13.700 --> 58:18.500
do it, because then it, it pushes it off on someone else

58:18.500 --> 58:19.220
for them to do.

58:20.100 --> 58:22.820
Yeah, not to go into the complaining about my work,

58:22.820 --> 58:24.980
because I could do that for literally hours.

58:24.980 --> 58:29.220
Um, they, there's a lot of, you'll get a lot of people

58:29.220 --> 58:32.500
saying, well, um, like when you ask them to do something

58:32.500 --> 58:34.980
correctly or to just like slow down to check your work

58:34.980 --> 58:37.860
and stuff, and they literally get, well, I'm busy.

58:37.860 --> 58:39.620
So I'm just going to do things quickly.

58:39.620 --> 58:41.940
Not going to ask questions, not going to check my work.

58:41.940 --> 58:45.700
It's just going to be wrong because I need to get it done.

58:45.700 --> 58:48.020
I'm so glad that that doesn't fly at my work.

58:48.580 --> 58:50.900
It's just, it's ridiculous.

58:52.900 --> 58:57.300
It goes into the people I think that are hired.

58:57.300 --> 58:59.940
I mean, honestly, people, it's become an ingrained part

58:59.940 --> 59:03.780
of society and it needs to be dis-engrained.

59:03.780 --> 59:07.460
There needs to be, you know, let, let them catch the,

59:07.460 --> 59:09.460
the, the consequences for not doing their job.

59:09.460 --> 59:10.820
There are none.

59:10.820 --> 59:11.140
Yeah.

59:11.140 --> 59:13.780
Unfortunately there are none and it's more of a, it's a

59:13.780 --> 59:16.500
culture where those type of people fail upwards.

59:16.500 --> 59:20.740
So, um, Deidre, Deidre on chat says, I had a user come

59:20.740 --> 59:22.900
in and not know how to shut down or restart their laptop.

59:22.900 --> 59:23.860
I swear to you on this.

59:23.860 --> 59:26.340
I told her to reboot and she Google searched how to restart

59:26.340 --> 59:26.980
Windows 10.

59:27.700 --> 59:29.140
And this was a Gen Z-er.

59:29.140 --> 59:32.340
This is not your stereotypical, like, okay, boomer type

59:32.340 --> 59:33.460
of situation.

59:33.460 --> 59:35.780
And let me, let me pair that with Bobby's comment here.

59:35.780 --> 59:38.100
This is shaping up to be the first generation where the

59:38.100 --> 59:40.820
parents know more about how to use computers than their kids.

59:41.380 --> 59:43.780
I do think there's a part of that though, where it's like,

59:43.780 --> 59:46.020
well, probably cause touch screens and that whole thing,

59:46.020 --> 59:48.740
like is going to be the future by the time the kids are in

59:48.740 --> 59:49.700
the working world.

59:49.700 --> 59:52.100
I think a lot of the working tools are going to be more

59:52.100 --> 59:53.380
situated to that platform.

59:53.380 --> 59:58.180
So there's that, but yeah, like, I just keep thinking of

59:58.180 --> 01:00:04.580
this scene from the, the Star Trek search for Spock.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.420
Were they not that, that one, it was a Star Trek four.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.060
I think it was four.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.420
The one where they went back and got the whales.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.060
The voyage home?

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.020
No, I don't think it was.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:14.660
I don't know.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.420
Yeah, it was Star Trek four where Scotty picks up the mouse

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.700
and goes, hello computer.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.500
And then, oh, a keyboard.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.140
How quaint.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.660
I mean, and I want to say like Deidre on mess.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.180
So like, uh, to be fair and I'm going to give major props

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:34.660
here, at least they took it on themselves to Google search

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.300
how to do it.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.860
Like, I don't have a problem with someone not knowing

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.580
something, it being very obvious, but you'd be surprised

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.700
the people that don't, if you don't know something that

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.220
they're actually seeking to know the answer, to figure it

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.020
out themselves.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.700
And I'm telling you right now that, that, you know, trait

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.700
about a person is so rare nowadays.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.380
It's just, it's ridiculous.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.180
So like, yeah, it is stupid that you'd have to do that,

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:01.620
but props for them to like, try to figure it out on their

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:01.940
own.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.740
So absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.380
We should acknowledge that they tried.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.020
Absolutely.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.300
Give them a gold star for that.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:14.500
You tried, but no, I honestly, yes, you're right.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.980
At least that person tried to fix the problem themselves

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.900
and research the answer.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.020
We should, we should acknowledge at least that, at least

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:22.260
that.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.060
All right.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:30.420
Oboe 47, hi, welcome to the station, says transparent

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.140
aluminum, or aluminium, depending on where you're from,

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.380
was patented before that movie came out.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:44.100
And Oboe was a really cool Wraith player who killed us all

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.500
and then was really nice and came in to my chat.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.660
I went against a Wraith today.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.460
I got out though.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.500
I'm just kidding.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.220
All right.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.620
To which Wraith is old news.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.660
It's all about Sadako now.

01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:58.900
All right.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.420
Sjoan Hunter Matt says, congrats, you did the bare minimum.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.140
Yes, very much in that particular case.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:05.540
All right.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.700
Anyway, so I wanted to go back to the original comment that

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.740
started this whole derailment, which was the executives

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:18.740
comment about the layoffs, which still seemed very okay

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:19.940
boomer to me.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:26.020
Like, he laid off a team that he didn't put any effort into

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.180
promoting because he doesn't get it.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.740
Like, he didn't bother to Google.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.780
What is a video game?

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.620
If he had Googled, how much money does the gaming industry

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.420
make? Did he lay off the Hollywood team?

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.380
Because guess what?

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.820
Gaming makes more than Hollywood.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:43.780
Right.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.740
Well, basically, he said we have no, they said that we've

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.620
received no clear explanation for why these layoffs had

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.100
to happen.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.180
As far as we could tell, they're not financially necessary

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.460
or rooted in any coherent business plan from our publisher

01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:00.340
who has said he expects the company to be larger a year

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:00.840
from now.

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:06.420
So I guess I don't know.

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.300
We're getting to lay all these people off and pay them

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.820
severance just to hire them back later.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.620
Is that what we're saying?

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.180
I mean, I don't know.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.180
Is he mad at, like, the gaming industry or something?

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.260
I mean, you do realize you own Twitch, right?

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:26.980
And Luna.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.480
For now.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.980
Why don't we talk about something that, like, does anyone

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.740
remember that Twitch has a cloud, Amazon has a cloud platform?

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.580
Does anyone remember that?

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:45.140
Here on Amazon's video game service, video game?

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.140
How often does Amazon like to remind you that Luna, like,

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.660
exists?

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.540
Yes, I know you can go into Prime Gaming and find some

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.340
things here and there.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.820
I know there's maybe an ad that gets inserted here and there

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:57.140
as well.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.940
But are they really trying as hard as they ought to?

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.620
I just realized I'm doing the period ads without even

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.660
thinking about it.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:06.260
Period.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.700
It just goes to show Amazon is a very siloed company.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.060
All right.

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.340
I can't see.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.460
And Chat says, one reason why I didn't go the PC route for

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.340
gaming is because of accessibility, sifting through menus,

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.660
tweaking, optimization, and upkeep.

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.620
And I remember from your story, I think you came in here

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.860
from one of Dar Sakura Stadia interviews.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.460
The neat thing about cloud gaming, you know, I don't know

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.020
if we're there yet with all of these, but there's a lot of

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:43.060
cloud games you could just pick up and go, right?

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.140
You don't have to worry about menus, configuration, or any

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:45.460
of that stuff.

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.180
Just pick up and go.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.300
I do think there's going to be more and more cloud gaming in

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:49.780
the future.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.580
I just, you know, Google was the wrong company.

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.660
Unfortunately, I think we all recognize that now.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.260
The right tech, but the wrong company.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.540
Anyway, let's see.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:05.460
Let's move on to another story, which is unfortunately in

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.820
the same kind of realm.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:12.580
But it's an executive who normally I think this guy has

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.460
his stuff together.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.780
So I want to dive into these comments a little bit, and this

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:18.500
has to do with Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox.

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:22.900
And this is further comment on 343 Industries and what's

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.380
going on with the Halo franchise and all that stuff.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:30.180
In an interview with IGN, Phil Spencer said, the heart and

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:34.740
soul of Halo is with 343 and the teams that there, and I

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:38.020
have the utmost confidence in the team that's there and

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.140
leading and the plan that they have going forward.

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:45.060
This, of course, after 343 last week was per reports hit

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:48.500
hard by Microsoft's company wide layoffs.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.540
We don't know exactly how many employees were let go, but

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:54.340
the Halo Infinite team, according to reporting, did see

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.020
significant cuts, which led to some chat online that they

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.140
were no longer going to do Halo, to which 343 put out a

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.100
brief statement saying, Halo and Master Chief are here to

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.620
stay. 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo now and

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.660
in the future, including Epic Stories multiplayer and more

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.500
of what makes Halo's great.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.860
Phil Spencer said the layoffs were an effort by Microsoft

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.620
to position 343 for the future.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.900
What we're doing now is we want to make sure that leadership

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.540
team is set up with the flexibility to build the plan that

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:24.580
they need to go build.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.580
Halo will remain critically important to what Xbox is doing

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:32.820
and 343 is critically important to the success of Halo.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.180
Unfortunately, nothing further because a logical follow-up

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.740
question you would ask in that case is, okay, so what is next

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.300
for Halo?

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.380
Phil Spencer said, I'm going to let 343 talk about the plans

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.740
that they have right now.

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.700
I expect that we'll be continuing to support and grow Halo

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.900
for as long as the Xbox is a platform for people to play.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:53.540
So walking a very safe line there.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.180
I mean, it's kind of a whole lot of nothing.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.220
I understand Phil Spencer's in a weird position.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.900
The one thing I don't like that he said is the whole like

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.940
it's positioning the leadership team to move forward with

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:13.060
Halo. How much of this is the leadership team's fault in

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.700
the first place?

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.260
I realize he can't say that in a public interview with IGN

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.100
when he's a publicly traded company.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.740
I just kind of I wonder behind the scenes.

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.780
The wonder behind the scenes, that's all.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.220
All right, let's move on to a simpler time in our next

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.620
segment. I think it is overdue at this point.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:48.260
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.780
I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.740
you about it.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.380
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.460
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick this week?

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:03.860
Picked words with friends.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:06.980
For reasons.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.060
Well, I mean, actually, go ahead.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.580
I'll leave my opinion for the end.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:13.800
Yeah.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.060
Well, I basically I like my word scapes game and I was like,

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.380
you know, this all started with Scrabble.

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.300
And it made me think about words with friends.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.100
And now we're like on the sequel version or something.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.940
So words with friends was developed by a company called

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:32.340
New Toy published by Zynga.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:39.620
And it is basically Scrabble that you can play online with

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:44.980
people. There's also a Solitaire mode that I really enjoyed

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:45.940
the Solitaire mode.

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:51.780
That was kind of my jam, but it was connected to Facebook

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:54.500
or just through regular username contacts.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.580
And then you can also be randomly assigned through smart

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:05.060
matches, you know, there were community matches, you know,

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.100
things like that.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.260
But it was cross platform when it was released.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:14.580
It was on iOS, on Windows Phone, Android.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.220
You could play it on Facebook, Kindle Fire and a Nook.

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:24.180
There was a chat feature that you could use to talk with

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.100
your opponents and other people.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:32.100
And between 2010 and 2011, it was one of the top ranking

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.700
games in the iOS app store.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:39.380
There was an ad free and a paid version that had no ads.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.860
In May 2017, words with friends was the most popular mobile

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:47.140
game in the US.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:51.540
And then the sequel came out September 2017.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.180
I mean, it really is basically Scrabble.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:59.380
It has the Scrabble distribution, the point values, all

01:09:59.380 --> 01:09:59.700
of it.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.620
It follows the Scrabble dictionary and remind me never to

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:08.500
play with Bobby as in our friends in Southern California,

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.100
because I thought you meant Mr.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:10.660
Black Wolf.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.220
No, I mean, I know he did.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.500
Yeah, Barbara.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.140
Other Bobby.

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:18.420
Yeah, because she knows legal terms.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.540
We don't play with her anymore.

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:25.940
But you also have your double letter or triple letter and

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.460
then your double word and triple word.

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:34.500
And then if a player can use all the seven tiles on a single

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:38.660
play, also known as a bingo in Scrabble, you get 35 bonus

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:44.580
points. I got that once and it was amazing.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:52.820
So you can also get some different arrangements as you

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.340
play. It can change each time.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:11:00.420
You also have a reassign feature and you can also pass your

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:05.060
turn. You can also swap to and you can look up what tiles

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.420
are left in your tile bag.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:11.780
So yeah, it's a little interesting.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:15.700
You can get power ups for word clue and word radar and

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:16.420
things like that.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.380
And then there was a feature that was temporarily removed.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.820
It was called Hindsight that let a player pay for the

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:30.500
opportunity to see what the highest scoring moves on the

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.220
board were after the play was made.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.340
But they brought it back.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:43.140
You can do random opponents and actually what I'm reading,

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:50.420
a lady in Chicago met up, started chatting with an opponent

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.380
from the Netherlands.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:56.340
They chatted the whole time and got married three years

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.940
later. Sorry, two years later.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.440
Wow.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.480
Another one in Georgia and Texas.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.800
Yeah, and there was even one I was reading about an American

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.480
player communicating about an Australian opponent's medical

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:24.360
symptoms and the American, the lady, her husband was a doctor.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:28.120
He recommended a hospital visit and it turned out that the

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:35.080
opponent had a 99% blockage close to his heart and actually

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.400
on a 2012 episode of the doctors, they got to meet in person.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:41.900
Wild.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.240
Yeah, but at any rate, they did do a board game version.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.440
That's the part that blows my mind.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.080
I know, right?

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.080
It was a board game called something else.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.840
Yeah, but they had like a luxe version with the rotating

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:02.040
tile game board and a travel to go edition and the all kinds

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:02.540
of shit.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.000
I was looking at the video for it rather incredulously.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.280
And actually, this isn't the only game that Zynga has done

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.240
physical versions of.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.120
There's Draw Something, Cityville edition of Monopoly and some

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.880
kids games based on Farmville.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:29.960
In 2019, there was a hack of Zynga that compromised details

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:35.960
of 218 million words with friends accounts, including names,

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.280
email addresses, login IDs, hashed passwords, password reset

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.280
tokens, phone numbers, Facebook IDs, and Zynga IDs.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.560
So hopefully they were able to get some of that resolved.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.880
But yeah, that's it.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.560
All right, words with fiends.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.760
And I'm seeing mostly the comments in chat are kind of talking

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.520
about like, I can't believe that this game is 10 years old.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.360
Like, because, you know, as a reminder for the new fans of

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.760
Orange Lawns Radio out there, we might have a new listener

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.400
or two every week.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.840
In order for a game to qualify as a classic game of the week,

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.360
it has to be at least 10 years older or more, which is funny

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.560
because this show's been on coming up on 21 years.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.280
So all of the time now in this segment, we're getting games

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.440
where it's like, we literally talked about this game when

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.240
it first came out.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.760
And now it's a classic game of the week.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.920
And I think there's people in chat very much feeling that

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.420
this week.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.920
Well, and also just to say, I mean, the game had like a

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.120
rather large impact.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.880
I mean, that's the other reason I brought it up.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.440
Oh, no.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.480
Yeah, mobile games.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.560
This is the one everyone was playing.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.800
Well, yeah, it's just earlier in the show, and I was talking

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.160
about NBA All World.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.720
When I was talking about NBA All World, I was saying, you

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.800
know, games that work very well from the cell phone are games

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.320
that are designed with that cell phone environment and what

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.000
your phone can and can't do in mind.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.480
And ironically, and I didn't even realize this.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.400
I mean, I knew what you picked earlier in the day, but I

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.320
didn't realize when I was saying those comments is that

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.680
this actually really plays right into that.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.240
Words with Friends is a great example of really one of the,

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.560
I don't want to say one of the earliest, let's put it that

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.200
way, mobile games that really did that.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.120
It did something on your mobile device, whether it's an iPad,

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.360
iPhone, Android, you name it.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.120
It did it on that device that like a port of Sonic the

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.040
Hedgehog doesn't do the same way.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.720
It made a uniquely mobile experience.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.400
Well, yeah, this is the kind of game that lends itself very

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:44.600
well to a touch experience, which I mean, for me, like I

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.200
said, it was always the Solitaire mode.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.040
That was my favorite thing.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.800
And it was actually Words with Friends 2 that had that sort

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:57.160
of linked circle mode, the kind of like a crossword-ish sort

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.280
of thing, but you had to move the letters to unscrabble them

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.760
and make the words with the given letters.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:09.800
That led me to Wordscapes, which I'm still pretty addicted to.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.120
I don't even know what level I am on that thing anymore.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.960
But in the tens of thousands, I'll put it that way.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.720
I can't see in chat says up there with Farmville and Wordle.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.840
I mean, honestly, yeah.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.440
My mother did Farmville.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.200
I was like, no.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.400
And that's exactly it.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.480
Words with Friends is one of those games where it's like,

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.400
you could play that with a grandparent, depending on your

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.440
family makeup or what have you.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.880
But if they made Wordle with Friends.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.720
I'm sure someone's already trying to jump on that idea if

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.760
they haven't already.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.840
But my point still stands.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.640
This also was a hugely important game because for many

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.520
people, it was the first game that they were playing with

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:51.640
somebody a generation or two older than them that maybe

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.120
otherwise wasn't playing a lot of games, wasn't interested

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.320
in playing Sonic, Mario Kart, whatever it is.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.680
But will Grandma, Grandpa play Word with Friends?

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.000
Yeah.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.600
So that's been a hugely transformative thing for some

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:04.920
people.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:11.000
So and I look at it as sort of a return to the simplicity

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.040
of retro games.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.880
You know, our retro games, they may have been kind of

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.920
difficult to play, but they were relatively simple to play.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.480
And games like this, you know, Farmville thing, whatever,

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.120
they're all fairly simplistic in a similar way.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And something that would be really easy for someone to

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.480
lose track of time.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.000
Or it would play into that addictive personality who like,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.200
no, I need to buy this thing in here so I can do this other

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.800
thing in the game and be better at it.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.560
It doesn't make you better at it.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.200
But that was my thought.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.200
So let's see going other in chat.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.040
I know you acknowledge this in chat, but I want to say this

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.320
for the sake of the podcast listeners.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.280
DJ Roma S said, thanks to your classic game last week.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.840
I went and bought Star Ocean R for Switch.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.280
That's another impact the classic game segment has sometimes

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.760
is like, hey, sometimes it makes you miss a game and you

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.560
want to go check it out.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.120
So your impact, Dark Soccer, your impact.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.200
I'm very impactful.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.400
Well, I did actually.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.960
I'm getting back to putting like my just a couple of

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.400
screenshots from my retro stream.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:25.000
So I did put up a couple of really nice pictures from playing

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.120
Star Ocean last night.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.120
Sgio100Matt says, true story, though.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.000
My fiancé said that one of the things that attracted her

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.960
to me initially was when I beat her the one time in Words

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.800
with Friends when we started dating.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.280
That's cute.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.240
Well, I told you what happened when I moved out here.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.040
Dan said I had to play through Strider and Castlevania

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:44.840
Symphony of the Night.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.720
And I did.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.760
And I beat Strider.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:52.040
Yeah, video games are great for bringing people together.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.560
Alan and I, we were long distance dating, but we were like

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.280
medium distance dating, which means he lived in South

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.080
San Francisco.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.840
I lived here in Sacramento, which, you know.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:02.520
Yeah, exactly.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.200
Which if you're not from here, that's like a two and a

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.720
half hour drive on a good night, maybe three and a half

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.560
if one of the bridges is fucked.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.680
But, you know, I would go see him on the weekend.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.960
But during the week we would play World of Warcraft together

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.520
and it was a way and we could actually quest together.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.080
So it's like we could hang out together in a virtual.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:21.960
Isn't that cute?

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.640
It's all playing well together.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.720
I mean, I don't miss well, but I miss us all playing the

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.680
same game together.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.400
Yeah, I hear that.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.440
Yeah, that's what makes it by daylight fun when it works

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.680
out that, you know, we all hop on that for, you know, a

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.000
night.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.760
I'm planning on doing killer tonight.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.400
Oh, people convince me otherwise.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.280
All right, we'll see.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.920
I may be around, but I actually have to work tomorrow.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.360
Man, these three day weekends spoil me.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:46.920
All right.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.080
This is actually officially starting my work week.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.560
So my days off for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.080
Ah, gotcha.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:53.640
Yeah.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:53.960
All right.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.920
Well, let's get into some other news headlines.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.080
I mentioned there's not a whole lot going on in the gaming

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.760
world this week, especially compared to other weeks.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.400
But we do have a few quick rapid fire headlines to talk

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:03.640
about.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.920
So let's go to Loki first.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.880
Yeah, since we've been talking about Ubisoft and all the

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.120
games are canceling, let's talk about some of the games

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.720
that they're reportedly working on, or at least rumors

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.440
are working on.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.440
One of those being some new games in the Far Cry franchise,

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:26.440
including a mainline Far Cry 7 and also a multiplayer Far

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.200
Cry game, live service game or something like that.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.320
Of course, they're not going to comment on rumor and

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:41.560
speculation, so I guess we'll wait until we find out what's

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.520
going to be coming out.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.440
All right, cool.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.920
One of the rumors of part of that, though, actually was

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.720
that it is going to be using the same engine, apparently,

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.760
as their open world Star Wars game, which I forgot that

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.040
they have a Star Wars game.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:59.240
So because you're not going to see it for years and years

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.720
longer still, probably, I guess.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:01.960
Yeah.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:08.040
Then we've got some TV news, including that Phoebe Waller

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:13.640
Bridge is set to be producing a Tomb Raider TV series for

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:18.600
Amazon. So that'll be interesting if that ends up happening.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.160
And then I just real quick.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:24.760
A Tomb Raider TV series is fascinating to me, and I wonder

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.800
if it would be a serial, like if it would be the Adventure

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.160
of the Week type of drama.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.800
Like, what was that show called?

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.400
Relic Hunter or so it was one of those.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.440
It was like really bad over the top, like Xeno Warrior Princess

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.600
Hercules. It was called Relic Hunter or something.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.440
Somebody in chat might know what I'm talking about.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.280
I wonder if that's where they're going to go a Tomb Raider.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.040
Please go.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.440
Please bring back Xeno Warrior Princess.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.120
That's basically what I'm saying.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.440
Basically.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:52.520
Yeah.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.640
I don't know if it's going to be bad.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.360
Oh, my God.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.200
Rama. Rama and I on the same wavelength.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:56.680
That is it.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:56.920
Yep.

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.040
We already had a Tomb Raider series.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.880
It's called Relic Hunter with Tia Carrere.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.440
That was it.

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.640
It was Tia Carrere's show.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:02.600
Fuck.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.400
She was amazing.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.080
She's not dead, but we don't see her in a lot of stuff

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:07.640
anymore.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.360
Tia Carrere.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:10.520
That's it.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.240
That's the tweet.

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:11.800
Tia Carrere.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:13.320
All right.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:18.440
And then not surprisingly, especially after the great

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.520
reception that the show's gotten already, Last of Us has

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.360
been renewed for a second season.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.200
Shocking.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:26.920
No words.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.160
Yeah.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.560
Nobody's surprised by that.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.000
Well, trailer.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.640
If it was on Netflix, it would have been canceled already.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:38.360
I guess shocking that, hey, we're actually having some

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.680
video game media that sticks around these days.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.640
Not all of it does.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.560
Hello, Resident Evil, speaking of Netflix.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.600
But to be fair, Castlevania, the anime did very well on

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.240
Netflix.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.840
So there's some video game media that's doing all right.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.200
So congrats to Last of Us.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.240
And to be fair, I heard that Resident Evil show was not

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:55.880
good either.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.080
So I guess that's fine.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.200
You win some, you lose some.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.400
Yeah.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:01.960
All right.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.440
Moving on.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.080
Dark Sakura.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:13.960
So wait, is this really mine?

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.880
Yeah, I think it's okay.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.360
Yeah.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.160
I don't follow these, so I was surprised.

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.160
There's going to be another Splatfest the weekend of

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.360
February 11th.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.080
It's going to ask if you like dark chocolate, milk chocolate,

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.360
or white chocolate.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.520
White chocolate isn't chocolate, so they're going to lose.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.960
That's why I thought you would be good for this one, because

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.840
I knew you would have something to say on the debate itself.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.400
White chocolate is like the mayo of chocolate.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.400
No, white chocolate is literally milk fat from making chocolate.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.200
It is the refuse in chocolate making.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.520
Alan hates it, too.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.920
I don't mind it, but I would absolutely be team milk chocolate

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.640
in this fight.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.200
No question.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.200
The purpose of white chocolate is a flavoring vehicle for

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.400
other flavors, perhaps, like in my Kit Kats.

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.600
Other than that, it is not chocolate.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.280
It is a vehicle and refuse.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.360
Or if for some reason you wanted to dye your chocolate a

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.280
color that is not brown, perhaps white chocolate would be

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.960
helpful. That's about it.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.080
No, because it would still be that fake white chocolate

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.680
sugar fat flavor.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:38.120
Anyway, so yeah, this is starting on February 11th and

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.040
going on through February 13th.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.600
So go team dark chocolate.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.520
Dark Tetsuya and Orange Rite are with you on team dark chocolate.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.400
Orange Rite says white chocolate will be the paper of

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:49.880
this one.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:55.720
I can't see suggests Oreos, Hershey's Hugs and Bark for, I

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.920
guess, white chocolate.

01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:00.680
So yeah, white chocolate is never eaten alone.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.840
It's always like dark soccer said, it's a vehicle for

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.040
something yummier.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.140
All right.

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:14.060
Moving on, one other rapid storyline here is about Arcade

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.420
OneUps latest announcement.

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.460
They have announced a new Star Wars cabinet, but I was like,

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.020
wait a minute.

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.940
They've already released a Star Wars cabinet.

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.060
Indeed, they have.

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:24.540
So that's why I put this one in rapid fire news, because all

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.020
this is it's a 40th anniversary cabinet.

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.060
It's going to be $600.

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.060
It does have the newer look to it where you actually have the

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.740
coin door look on the front.

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.860
Like, for instance, a lot of the quote unquote older machines,

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.420
which, like, Tron is only a year old, but now they're changing

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:42.620
this front panel to look like a fake coin door.

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.780
So the new Star Wars machines are going to have that coin

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.340
door look on it in part.

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.780
Unfortunately, I don't hear that it has any new games in it.

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.300
It's still just the same three games.

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:55.340
But of course, what other games can you put in a full size

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:56.220
cabinet or something?

01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.900
It is full cup.

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.180
No, because it has a riser.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.100
So it's not a full size machine.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.300
Yeah, but it does have that same flight yoke.

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.220
I don't know if maybe they made improvements to the yoke,

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:10.700
because I know some people are not fans of that.

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.540
So there's that.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.620
So if you want to pick up one of those, you can at the Arcade

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:19.020
OneUp website, but I'm thinking a lot of folks that were

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:21.900
interested in the Star Wars cab probably already picked it

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:25.260
up. But if you really want the new artwork, there you go.

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:30.780
All right, let's get back into just another couple quick

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:31.660
headlines.

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.820
We're going to open it up pretty soon to your phone calls

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:34.620
and feedback.

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.020
If you want to give us a call live, you can head on over

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:40.860
to our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:44.540
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord and join the green room.

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.260
And that's where we'll be looking for any potential callers

01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:52.060
tonight. Meanwhile, let's get to some world release.

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.820
I'm sorry, we didn't cover release dates yet.

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:54.860
We should probably do that.

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.620
And then we'll get into a couple last headlines here.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.740
So let's do release dates first.

01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.020
Loki in the US.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:26:59.660
All right.

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:04.060
So in the US, we have backfire wall on PC, PlayStation 4,

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:07.100
PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.460
Trek the Yomi on Nintendo Switch.

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.380
8-bit adventures on PC.

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:17.340
Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition on Xbox One and Xbox

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:17.740
Series.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.300
Powerwashing Simulator.

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.980
I guess it's Powerwash Simulator.

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:25.500
That's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.620
Also that wonderful Tomb Raider DLC coming out this week

01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:28.940
as well.

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:29.820
Can't wait to play that.

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:38.220
We have Raiden 4 Cross Mikado Remix on whatever Raiden,

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.980
Raiden, tomato, tomato.

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:41.500
No, it's Raiden.

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:43.260
Fine.

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.060
It's Raiden.

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.100
That is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:50.780
Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:55.500
SpongeBob SquarePants and the Cosmic Shake on the PC,

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.860
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:02.780
And We Were Here Forever, the DMV simulator.

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.580
No, I don't know what that is, but it's a puzzle adventure

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.180
game that's on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.060
Xbox Series.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.940
And oh, a couple more.

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:15.420
Actually, I was really close to importing that game for

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:18.300
the record, except it's Raiden 3, which is like the weakest

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.420
one in the series.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.180
But the music is amazing.

01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:22.300
Oh, this one says it's four.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.140
I said it was four.

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.740
The Playasia one said Raiden 3.

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.940
I'll have to double check it.

01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.020
Yeah, it's four.

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:31.740
Yeah, it looks like.

01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.700
And then we've got Football Manager 2023 on PlayStation 5,

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:40.700
Rhythm Sprout on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:45.660
PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Chef Life, a restaurant

01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:49.420
simulator on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.420
5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:57.660
Deliver Us Mars on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:59.180
One, Xbox Series.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.980
Fashion Police Squad getting its console release on

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.900
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:06.860
Xbox Series.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.220
Life is Strange 2 on Nintendo Switch.

01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.460
Puzzle Bubbles slash Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition and

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:20.780
Puzzle Bubble 3 and slash Bust-A-Move 3 S Tribute on PC,

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.500
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:31.420
We have Helvelti on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:35.980
Joe Wander and the Enigmatic Adventures on PC, PlayStation

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:38.140
5 and Xbox Series.

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:38.780
And that is it.

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:40.140
All right.

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:43.420
Well, Japan's release calendar is looking a little smaller.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.300
If we go over to Japan and check out the Nintendo Switch,

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.860
there's some accessories, but they're all third party.

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:51.180
Like if you really want a Doraemon pouch for your Switch,

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.860
cool, you can get that this week.

01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.260
But as far as games go, there's just one for the Switch this

01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.460
week on February 2nd.

01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:58.700
Life in Willowdale Farm Adventures.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.580
And that's a multilingual release that's coming out.

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.580
There's also a Doraemon wireless controller.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.580
Again, as long as we're talking about third party shit.

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:08.060
But I seem to recall that there was a Doraemon game in last

01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:08.860
week's releases.

01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.780
So I mean, this is pretty well timed, I suppose.

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.220
Flying over to the PlayStation 5, guess what?

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.900
Nothing until the Wizard game comes out on February 7th

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.780
in Japan, because I believe that is a worldwide release with

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.500
everything else.

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:27.420
Otherwise, yeah, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:28.700
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:32.860
I think you're muted.

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.700
A hard mute on Discord because I see the icon.

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:39.100
Well, it's not even a worthwhile game to talk about.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:43.740
It's a SpongeBob SquarePants cosmic shake on the 31st.

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.540
Hey, I love SpongeBob, but I don't play the games.

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.420
Also, for the record, for a certain game that is coming out

01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.820
in February, I'm not going to mention it at all.

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:56.300
All right, moving on.

01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.700
Let's get into a couple of quick headlines, and then we're

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.700
going to wrap it all up here.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:01.660
See if there's some phone calls.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.420
Let's go to Loki.

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:09.260
Yeah, so a judge has blocked Microsoft's request to pause

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:16.620
a lawsuit brought by the Alito law firm and Joseph

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.900
Saveri law firm on behalf of their plaintiffs, which are

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:25.340
some gamers, I guess, who were basically trying to block

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:30.060
the whole acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft,

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.900
saying that it's anti-competitive.

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.420
So I guess this is going to be going forward on top of all

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:40.140
of the other stuff that they're facing with the antitrust

01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:43.820
things. I don't see where individual gamers really get to

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:48.220
have a say in which acquisitions happen or not, but okay.

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.220
I guess we'll see what happens.

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.500
Just another day in the courtroom, right?

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.860
It just seems like it's a bit ridiculous.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:05.900
You would think that, I get where they're saying

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:11.580
anti-competitive and stuff, but at the same time, how do

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.740
you really prove damages from that?

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:18.540
It just doesn't make any sense how you can say, oh, well,

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.620
this is going to harm me specifically.

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.580
It's like, well.

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.660
Well, and it's also just really reductive with what the

01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:26.540
antitrust process is supposed to do anyway.

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.420
So it's basically a bunch of gamers saying, we don't trust

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:30.940
the government to do anything about it.

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.700
So we're taking matters into our own hands.

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:35.340
And then essentially a different branch of the government

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:39.820
judicial is stepping in and saying, no, that's basically

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:39.980
what it is.

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:43.500
In this case, they're saying yes, because they're letting

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.140
it go forward.

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.500
They're blocking Microsoft.

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:45.660
Okay.

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.060
So let the circus begin, I guess.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.660
I don't see how it goes anywhere.

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:55.660
Again, this is what the antitrust process is supposed to

01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:56.940
do. This is silly.

01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:58.620
It's dumb.

01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:58.860
Yeah.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.500
Last story tonight.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.060
Dark Sakura.

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:12.700
So there is a streamer in Japan known as Mote Kimaru, who

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:17.100
basically has tetra fish that play video games, like a lot

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:24.140
of Pokemon, for example, using motion sensor and like a

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:24.860
motion board.

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:30.060
Well, and that by itself is actually kind of cool.

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.860
And his fish are pretty good at it, apparently.

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.540
But at one time while he was live streaming Pokemon, he had

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.860
stepped away for a break and the game had crashed.

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:43.020
And then it went back to the home screen like it does.

01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:47.100
And the fish kept on swimming because fish swim.

01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.940
And then during the next seven hours, the fish managed to

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:56.540
change the name of the Switch account twice, logged into

01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:57.660
the Nintendo store.

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.100
They checked legal terms and conditions, downloaded a new

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:05.100
avatar, set up a PayPal account, sent an email to confirm

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:10.220
and a video on the live stream actually showed this.

01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:17.500
And they were also seen adding 500 yen to Mote Kimaru's

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:20.460
Switch account from his credit card.

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.460
And it also exposes credit card details.

01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:31.500
Um, and so at this point, you know, people were just all

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.780
on about it.

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.940
And he said that that afterwards he's contacted Nintendo

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:41.180
to to see what happened and ask for a refund of his, you

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.060
know, four bucks, 500 yen.

01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.820
Is this the plot of Sharknado 6?

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.140
Like Sharknado shopping spree at the mall?

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:49.980
Tetranado.

01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.260
There you go.

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.620
Tetranado.

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.980
And Nintendo, of course, hasn't said anything, but I mean,

01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.580
this went to CNN.

01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:03.980
So I mean, it's it's oddly enough.

01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:06.620
And I mean, and it literally I'm looking at this screenshot

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:10.860
from from his Twitch and it's it's.

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:12.400
Yeah.

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:13.840
Wow.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:19.740
Oboe 47 in chat says it wasn't a new release of Skyrim.

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.620
No, I mean, the fish probably could have bought

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.940
that on the Switch through the store place.

01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.940
I mean, it would have had to have been just a perfect swim

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:36.940
storm, a perfect a perfect current to get that series of

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:37.820
events to happen.

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.860
At least he has a video proof that he had nothing to do

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:41.360
with it.

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:44.860
Or as you might say, fish roe duh.

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.340
Fish roe duh.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.340
Huh?

01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:52.380
It's the Elder Scrolls joke.

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:53.100
Forget it.

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:53.600
All right.

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:55.260
Yeah, I don't like Elder Scrolls.

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.900
I don't get it at all.

01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:58.620
Sorry.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.140
Just look in chat.

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.340
Everybody's booing me.

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:01.840
All right.

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:02.960
Sorry.

01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:05.980
The spirit of Drewnami had possessed me for a moment.

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:07.120
All right.

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.940
Let's get to the listener roundtable where we invite you

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.700
all to participate along with the show.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.340
If you have questions for us, obviously, we have a little

01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:16.140
extra time tonight.

01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.220
I'm happy to take questions in our chat over at

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.540
twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.900
We also at this point of the show usually look for any

01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:28.700
emails. I feel like it's been dry January in our inbox, but

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.580
I didn't even check.

01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.260
That's how much I forgot about it.

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:32.700
I don't think anything's there.

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.580
Go ahead and look again.

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:37.020
But again, if you want to send us an email, participate.

01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:38.940
Do I need to spell it for you?

01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:42.700
Participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:43.180
your email.

01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:46.060
At this point, I want someone to send me an email just to

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:46.860
make sure it works.

01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:50.860
We got something about the audio fiction world cup.

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:52.380
It's junk.

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:55.260
Unfortunately, the spammers have our new address now.

01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.380
We've hardly gotten any spam.

01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:58.540
Yeah.

01:36:58.540 --> 01:36:59.660
Not compared to the old box.

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:01.020
The old mailbox was way worse.

01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.660
I'm pretty sure somebody hate signed us up for a bunch of

01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:05.980
stuff because we dare to be people with a podcast when

01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:07.660
podcast was new.

01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.900
So because we're better than everybody, what are you talking

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:11.900
about? And so humble.

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:13.500
Let's see.

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:16.060
Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories.

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:17.340
It's been a heck of a slow news week.

01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.340
I think we covered just about everything, but I will check

01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:22.060
anyway. How hell we had breaking news earlier in the show.

01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:23.900
I don't think so.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.540
I didn't see anything.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.620
I mean, it's not really much of a story.

01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:31.260
There was a 30 second clip.

01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:35.980
I guess it's a TV spot or something showing a little bit

01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:40.220
more of the scene in the Mario movie with Donkey Kong and

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:44.300
Mario and shocker Donkey Kong, voiced by Seth Rogan.

01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:46.300
Sounds like Seth Rogan.

01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:52.220
You don't say he did not put on a monkey accent.

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.860
So yeah, it's very disappointing that it's very not authentic

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:02.300
to the voice of Donkey calling that we've grown to know and

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:05.580
love all of the dialogue that Donkey Kong is bless us with

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.780
in the myriad of games that he's been out in.

01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:14.140
Are you saying that they're setting up for a sequel from

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.420
based on a 30 second clip?

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.380
They show cat Mario.

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:19.900
I mean, that's kind of funny.

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.420
I mean, the Mario movie looks cute.

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:24.060
I got to go see it.

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:24.700
I mean, yeah.

01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:28.940
She hold 10 and chat says, is Loki going to play the new

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.700
Golden Eye game pass update?

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.620
You know, Golden Eye 007.

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:32.940
What?

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.180
Honestly, it's a miracle that that game came out.

01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:37.260
When you consider all the licensing that went into it.

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.540
It was a Nintendo 64 game made by a now owned by Microsoft

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:45.660
company, Rare, with celebrity likeness of Pierce Brosnan,

01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:48.780
with a property that belongs to the Bond estate.

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.660
Like, do you know how many people had to sign off on this

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.940
game getting released?

01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:54.940
So now it's here.

01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:58.140
And I mean, has it?

01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.180
Loki, did you check it out yet?

01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:01.420
It's on my to do list, but I didn't get to it this week.

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.340
I don't really have any nostalgia for it.

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:05.820
I've played it a little bit with friends long time ago,

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:08.300
back in the Nintendo 64, but I don't really have any

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.260
nostalgia for it.

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:14.300
So I hear that the controls on the Switch aren't great.

01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:17.180
You need to change those.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:20.620
But the Xbox couldn't be good.

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.740
Like the old one did.

01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:28.300
I wonder if it plays at a higher frame rate or what happens

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:30.860
now. I want to check it out out of morbid curiosity, but

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:33.020
I'm kind of in the boat with Loki to be honest.

01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:35.660
I don't have the same emotional attachment to Golden

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:39.980
like most of you do, because when that game came out, if I

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:43.180
was playing a Nintendo 64, I tell you it was Mario Kart,

01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:46.540
Mario Kart 64 and nothing but like, that was the only game

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.980
we ever played in the college dorm on Nintendo 64.

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.620
Hell, even my Super Nintendo and the old school Mario Kart

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:53.980
was played.

01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:57.740
But as far as shooters go, we were playing Duke Nukem at

01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.820
that time, because that was right around the same time when

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:04.620
Duke Nukem was on PC, and we were able to play because the

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.140
old computers had the modems.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:08.300
And so I could call my neighbor in the dorm.

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:12.620
It was just before like wired internet and dorms became big,

01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:13.820
but you would call through the phone light.

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:16.460
We would play Duke Nukem across the phone.

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:18.860
And so we kind of did that instead of Goldeneye.

01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:23.100
So when I was in college, it was just Doom.

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.820
Yeah, Doom, Doom as well.

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:28.620
I was going to say Doom 2, but I meant Doom also, but

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.420
sometimes Doom 2.

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:31.260
No, for us, it was Doom.

01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:33.180
I think when did Doom 2 come out?

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:33.980
I have to remember.

01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:41.260
But OK, why is it not giving me the right date for Doom 2?

01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:42.620
OK, actually, no.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:46.540
Yeah, we were doing Doom 2 because that was 1994.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:49.100
And they weren't that far apart, the first two.

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:49.740
Yeah.

01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:51.420
And Hexen was the other thing.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.020
But we didn't I didn't get to play Duke Nukem until we had a

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:58.940
LAN party at Mobicon in 1996.

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:04.780
My friends, my friends at Sonoma State, they got T1 internet,

01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:08.140
which was like the high speed fucking remember that?

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:11.100
That was like if you had T1 internet, you were rich, right?

01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.380
So do you have a T1?

01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:12.700
Yeah.

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:13.820
You have a T3?

01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:16.620
So they got T1 internet in their dorms.

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:18.700
So they started the Quake server.

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:21.020
And then that became the game we all played.

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:25.100
I would call into their server over the T1 or whatever from

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.100
my thing, and we would all fucking play the shit out of

01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:30.300
Quake and like the early Team Fortress mods and those types

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:30.800
of things.

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.580
When we had our Dreamcast in the ethernet adapter, Dan was

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:39.980
really into playing Quake on our Dreamcast for a hot minute.

01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:41.900
Since we couldn't play PSO.

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.180
So dumb.

01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:47.820
Like, why would they put out an online game that has the

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:52.060
online capability, but disable the thing that makes it go

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:52.460
online?

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.820
DarkTitius says, can we get a Quake night going?

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:57.740
I think the remaster has cross play.

01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:58.460
I'd be in.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:58.940
I play.

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:01.420
So me, DarkTitsia, can we get like two other people to do

01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:03.580
it? Because then I only if we do ASCII Quake.

01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:05.660
What the fuck is ASCII Quake?

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.740
It's in Quake.

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.580
There is a mode to play it in ASCII.

01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:10.860
Killi.

01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:11.740
I didn't know that.

01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:15.180
I don't know if the remake because I believe I have done

01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:17.420
Quake as a classic game of the month and spoke on this at

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:17.740
length.

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:22.220
I think somebody was asking me earlier today about something

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.980
I said last week on this show.

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:25.340
And I was like, what was I talking about?

01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:25.900
I don't remember.

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.980
I don't remember what we talk about in this program.

01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:30.540
Are you serious?

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:32.860
Yeah, it was actually sorry.

01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:37.180
Yeah, there was Quake live and then Quake 2 had text mode.

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:41.340
I remember the console was built into Quake, but yeah.

01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:43.420
Yeah, it was.

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.220
Okay, nevermind.

01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:45.100
Yeah, it was.

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:45.580
It was.

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:49.660
I'm sorry, it was a mod.

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:50.300
My apologies.

01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:50.780
It was a mod.

01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:55.260
So, but yeah, it's also very disorienting, but I played

01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.100
and I'm not fond of it.

01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:57.660
But Dr.

01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:00.060
Tua, yes, if we could get the people, I'd so be down for

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.900
a Quake just for fun.

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:06.220
So because the remake is really most people got it for free

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:07.980
at some point one way or another.

01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.540
Is it maybe it's still free for all I know.

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:13.820
I don't know, but I'm sure it's on game pass if nothing else.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.340
So all right.

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:20.060
Well, with that in the chat, I did link a video to text

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:20.460
Quake.

01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:24.060
Let me see this, because I'm not sure I've ever actually

01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:26.620
and we have the time, so I might as well take a look.

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.060
Oh, God, this looks terrible.

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:32.220
But like, doesn't it in one of those, like, I'm gonna actually

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:34.140
fast forward a little bit here in the clip so we can actually

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.900
see this dark soccer.

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:37.500
This actually looks worse.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:42.460
And to describe what I'm seeing for the podcast listeners

01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:46.460
is that it literally is the entire screen is made up of

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.780
ASCII characters, meaning like, you know, text characters

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:50.140
with the keyboard and things like that.

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:52.940
If you're not familiar with the term ASCII, but it's like,

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:55.180
it's one of those.

01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:55.500
You know what?

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.900
It reminds me of, like, those pictures where, like, if you

01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:01.020
stand way back in the room, then you can tell what it is.

01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:02.940
But if you're looking close up, you see that.

01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:03.900
Do you see the sailboat?

01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:09.020
Not those scooter, but similar.

01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:09.500
Yes.

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:10.780
Similar to that vibe.

01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:11.280
Yes.

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:16.380
How could you possibly play a video game like this?

01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:16.620
Yeah.

01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:18.700
I'm getting a headache watching that.

01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.340
Same.

01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:20.380
Yeah, it is the novelty.

01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:21.660
All right.

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:23.100
I like to play Gatchamon Quake.

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:27.900
Well, with that, we are at the end of the program, so I'm

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:29.900
going to go around and get everybody's final thought and

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:30.460
wrap things up.

01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:32.700
But I do want to say thank you very much for listening to

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:32.940
the show.

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.940
I know it was a little shorter tonight, but sometimes there

01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.540
just isn't as much gaming news.

01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.460
I hope everybody had a wonderful week.

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:39.740
I hope you have a great week ahead.

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.300
I hope you're enjoying playing things, whether it's new

01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:45.900
surprise releases like HiFi Rush or, you know, or Forespoken,

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.700
something you were waiting for, or just the same old shit.

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:51.180
If you're still playing Dead by Daylight, that is fine, too,

01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:51.980
or whatever it is.

01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:54.700
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio,

01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:55.900
tell a friend or two about the show.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.660
Help us spread the word because we are the show where

01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.980
every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here to

01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:00.860
put out on air.

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:03.500
So a nice five-star review wherever you found this show

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:04.620
goes an awful long way.

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:09.340
A site like iTunes or Spotify helps an awful lot, and we

01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.060
just appreciate those words, mouths, social media shares.

01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.740
They work great as well.

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.060
We're at the end, so let me go and get final thoughts for

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:18.460
the night.

01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:20.700
DarkSakra, as usual, I'll start with you because I know

01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:24.220
you're gonna go play on your own stream after the show

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:28.700
tonight. Yeah, I'm gonna get back to trying to

01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:32.060
adapt my killers and try to remember how to play most of

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:36.620
them. I actually even have it as a redeem now that you can

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:37.740
force me to play nurse.

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:39.500
Oh, wow.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:40.540
Heaven help me.

01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:41.020
Good luck.

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:44.300
Remember, I got my adapt because they gave it to me.

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.500
I am going to have to play her eventually, but I suck at

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:51.500
nurse. I would play blight better than nurse and I suck at

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:52.460
blight twins.

01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:57.340
Actually, I'm kind of okay at twins now, kind of sort of,

01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:02.700
but I did totally already adapt Pig and Freddie because

01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.460
they are my mains and I did them in one try.

01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:05.900
So it wasn't a big deal.

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.260
But yeah, I think I might go back to the adapt thing, but

01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.460
if I get sick of it, who knows?

01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.580
Maybe we'll Swift.

01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:14.300
All right, well have a great stream and we will talk to you

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.300
next week in February.

01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:17.900
I can't believe it's already going to be February.

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:18.780
All right.

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:19.180
Right.

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:20.300
Yeah, exactly.

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:22.700
Loki, we'll go to you.

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:23.820
What's your final thought tonight?

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:25.500
I'm tired.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:25.900
That's it.

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:27.580
You're tired.

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:28.380
You need a nap.

01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:28.940
I understand.

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:34.620
My final thought is I haven't done personal streaming in

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:36.460
a few weeks because again, as I talked about at the top of

01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:38.300
the show, I've had some personal stuff going on, especially

01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:39.020
this week.

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.340
I am looking at trying to pick up some more narrative games,

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.740
especially now that I've let my wow subscription lapse and

01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:46.540
my only MMO I'm playing now is Final Fantasy 14.

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:48.860
I want to try to really play through some single player games.

01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:52.620
I definitely want to do the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters,

01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:56.140
Windows release on Switch, PlayStation, that whole thing.

01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:58.700
I might close the gap on some Pokemon games.

01:46:58.700 --> 01:46:59.660
I'm really behind on.

01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:02.620
I really have an itch to go back and finish Pokemon Arceus,

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.820
which I know, like, why would I do that when I still need

01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.180
to beat Scarlet and Violet?

01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:09.100
Because I'm at the point now where I'm like, if they're

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:12.300
working on a quality of life update for Scarlet and Violet,

01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.300
then why don't I wait for that update?

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:16.700
It's this very weird day and age we live in where it's like,

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:18.780
now I know a patch is coming, so I'm going to wait for the

01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:20.540
patch till I finish the game.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:22.460
It's weird how that goes sometimes.

01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.220
But anyway, that's it for me.

01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.540
We'll see you again in a week.

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.380
Thank you so much for being here tonight, everyone.

01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.580
I really appreciate it.

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.740
Have a wonderful week and good night.
