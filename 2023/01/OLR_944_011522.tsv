0	13660	Cost, savings, and maintenance control are no longer just an appliance and computer thing.
13660	17780	With the invent and proliferation of renewable energy and more on-peak, off-peak energy plans,
17780	21540	Xbox is going to allow the user to define when the Xbox should wake up and use more
21540	25160	power to phone home, gather updates, download and upload data, etc.
25160	27560	The Xbox's green now means just a little bit more.
27560	30280	This is your electrical grid health update, except in Texas.
30280	33520	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
33520	36320	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every
36320	38760	gamer has a voice.
38760	47720	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
47720	50200	where every gamer has a voice.
50200	57560	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 944 of our
57560	61940	show for tonight, January the 15th of 2023.
61940	70240	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70240	71880	Your audio isn't coming through for some reason?
71880	72880	That's weird.
72880	73880	I don't know if it's noise-gating.
73880	74880	Oh, there you are.
74880	75880	Hi.
75880	77360	Yeah, it should be fine.
77360	78360	I had everything.
78360	79800	I checked it all before.
79800	81960	There's just a weird delay on the noise gate.
81960	82960	It's all right.
82960	83960	How are you doing?
83960	84960	Yeah.
84960	86580	I'm still tired.
86580	87800	Still tired?
87800	91000	I actually stayed up all night trying to reset my sleep schedule, and then I took a little
91000	93220	bit of a nap, some kind of groggy.
93220	94480	Is that because of your subathon?
94480	96680	No, you weren't up that late with the subathon, right?
96680	97680	No.
97680	99960	It's because I've been staying up really late, and I'm going back to work on Saturday.
99960	100960	Oh, right.
100960	101960	Okay.
101960	102960	Yes, I'm permitted.
102960	103960	Yeah.
103960	112560	But yeah, I did 12 and a half hours, which isn't too bad.
112560	118540	I thought I was going to do a bonus killer hour, and I was like, no, no, done.
118540	119540	Your body's done.
119540	120540	And I wore that thing.
120540	124760	I tried to wear that thing, my pig mask.
124760	129960	It's one of the special cosmetics in Dead by Daylight, where it's the half of a reverse
129960	136280	bear trap and then a white mask resembling jigsaw for those who are, of course, just
136280	137280	listening.
137280	141120	But I wore that thing and found out that the hat wouldn't fit over my headphones and that
141120	144840	the mask was giving me a headache while I was trying to play, so I just said, screw
144840	145840	it.
145840	146840	Yeah, that's a lot.
146840	147840	Yeah.
147840	148840	Yeah.
148840	152240	But I had a really fun time, and I'm actually getting ready to publish a video of the best
152240	153240	part of the stream.
153240	154240	Oh, fun.
154240	155240	All right.
155240	156240	Yeah.
156240	157240	Well, let's say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
157240	158240	Hello.
158240	159240	Hi, Loki.
159520	160520	Hey, how are you doing?
160520	161520	I'm doing okay.
161520	162520	Okay.
162520	166640	So I have to ask, you play games behind, well, you're not playing it live, but you're playing
166640	171540	footage of a game behind you because you can sometimes watch our rooms, our environment
171540	176320	because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG network every
176320	180760	Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf
180760	181760	show.
181760	187680	And as we are taping live, Bob, or not Bobby, Loki has the Smurfs on the Coleco vision,
187680	189040	I think, playing behind him.
189040	190040	That is correct.
190040	191040	Right now.
191040	192040	Okay.
192040	194480	I got to know what, why this game this week?
194480	197120	It's just, it was a game I used to play as a kid.
197120	198120	Okay.
198120	201640	I played the one on Atari, but because, you know, that game was like on every platform.
201640	203520	You know, we've talked about this in previous weeks.
203520	208040	If you think it's weird that we have like PlayStation and Xbox and switch now, boy,
208040	216280	oh boy, in the eighties, it was, you know, Coleco, Atari, Commodore, Apple, three different
216280	223480	types of Atari's 5200, 7800, 2600, TI 99 4a, like everything, just everything.
223480	228760	So yeah, some games like Smurfs, I think we're on probably most of those platforms.
228760	234300	So Zen monkey 11 in our chat says jumping on that skull was a pain in the ass for me
234300	237600	as a kid watching some of those old games are really hard.
237600	240880	Yeah, I didn't remember that.
240880	246100	I guess there is different difficulty levels you could select because like I saw and it
246100	247940	will be later in the clip there.
247940	252900	Like there's like a spider and stuff like, I don't remember there being a spider or like
252900	258180	I sort of remember the crow, but I don't know.
258180	260820	So maybe I must have played it on super easy.
260820	261820	All right.
261820	262820	All right.
262820	263820	Yeah.
263820	266300	I mean, it makes sense that you probably were, if you were young, you were probably playing
266300	267440	on the lowest difficulty.
267440	268440	So fair enough.
268440	269620	Uh, let's see.
269620	273500	Tiger class says I had a Coleco vision in the form of the Adam computer.
273500	277060	I remember borrowing a Smurf cartridge from a kid at school to play it.
277060	278060	Oh yes.
278060	280300	I loved, I loved trading cartridges when I was younger.
280300	282900	Coleco Adam and a Coleco vision.
282900	283900	Nice.
283900	289180	And the Coleco Adam was a piece of shit because of the cassette deck and the power supply.
289180	294100	And if you had a thunderstorm kiss every single cassette that you have near that thing goodbye.
294100	295100	Oh yeah.
295100	297800	I, I don't miss the days of games on cassette tape.
297800	298800	That's for sure.
298800	299800	Cause Commodore had that too.
299800	304640	It was a, it's so, so it's so weird to think that games were on a cassette tape, but then
304640	307520	again, games were on CD a few years later.
307520	312360	And so it's, it makes sense that a lot of the, uh, you know, entertainment media games
312360	313360	followed that too.
313360	314360	Why not?
314360	319960	I think my, my favorite part about this game was the sound when you die.
319960	325660	Cause every time it was just be like, it's playing the, you know, fun Smurf sounds like
325660	329380	their, their theme, I think in the back and then you hit something, it's like smack.
329380	331300	It's just like you instantly fall down.
331300	332700	There's no animation of dying.
332700	334820	It's just smack on the ground.
334820	335820	That's it.
335820	337420	Like that sound in a Cubert cabinet.
337420	343020	If you can find a Cubert cabinet that still works prime when Cubert falls off the edge
343020	347260	of the cube, it actually has some type of mechanism that makes a very loud, like smack,
347260	351540	like when Cubert hits the ground, there's some mechanism in the cab cabinet that does
351540	352540	that.
352540	355500	Is it like a loud, loud clack like that?
355500	356500	Something like that.
356500	357500	Yeah.
357500	359340	It's a little more subtle than that, but it was still funny because I remember.
359340	364420	They used to crack me up all the time, um, myself and my sister and we would purposely
364420	371020	just run the Smurfs into something like over and over because it was just ridiculous.
371020	376280	You know, speaking of cassette tapes and classic games, I can actually think of the best use
376280	378660	of a cassette for a video game ever.
378660	384600	And that was the 1980s journey arcade game that actually had the cassette tape that would
384600	385600	play the song.
385600	387180	I don't remember which their songs it was.
387180	390180	I think it was any way you want it, maybe they would actually play the song when you
390180	391820	actually got to the concert.
391820	397380	Because if you play it now, unlike, I don't know, like the Xbox, it's hard to find that
397380	398380	game actually.
398380	401780	But even in like MAME probably, unless somebody's emulated the tape at this point, which is
401780	403020	certainly possible.
403020	406880	You just hear blank stuff when you get to that concert level at the end, but it's supposed
406880	410300	to be a cassette tape of them actually playing the song, which is really funny.
410300	416940	So anyway, trip down memory lane, but let's get to a trip down current lane here and talk
416940	422220	about our first story tonight, which has to do with some pretty big changes over on
422220	423220	YouTube.
423220	426900	And look, I don't want people to think just because we're on Twitch, we're picking on
426900	427900	YouTube.
427900	428900	We are fair.
428900	433180	And when we go back in the archives, folks, when there's Twitch changes we don't like,
433180	435580	we cover those two very thoroughly.
435580	438700	But Loki, I know you're a YouTuber.
438700	441340	There's been a lot of activity on YouTube this week, actually, I want to talk about.
441340	446500	But Loki, tell us about the changes over on YouTube that are not being received too
446500	447500	hot.
447500	448500	Right.
448500	453020	So they made a change to kind of their family friendly guidelines.
453020	460940	Basically now you cannot have, you will receive limited monetization or demonetization if
460940	465940	you have swearing within the first 15 seconds of your video.
465940	467980	And same, I think it's even like eight seconds.
467980	470620	There's like different thresholds.
470620	475940	But it's basically the first 15 seconds if you have swearing in it, then they will demonetize
475940	478900	your your video.
478900	480220	Which is really stupid.
480220	485020	For one, here's the more stupid thing, though, that people are really getting upset with
485020	488740	is that, you know, it wasn't always like this.
488740	493660	And they are now retroactively making any video that you've put up, not like from the
493660	500940	time that, you know, we put this change in the place, but all of time, and they're retroactively
500940	503820	demonetizing those videos.
503820	510260	So like, how are you supposed to be able to follow these guidelines, if like the guideline
510260	514660	will change in the future, and there's no and there's absolutely no way for you to go
514660	516860	and edit out that content.
516860	521620	Once it's demonetized via this process, it's always going to be demonetized, you'd have
521620	528520	to re upload the video for it to be monetizable again, which is just stupid.
528520	529520	To begin with.
529520	534140	Also, they are also going after violent content.
534140	538820	So for example, if you're playing a violent video game, and not everybody's channel is
538820	542820	family friendly, but if you're playing like, you know, a game that has a lot of blood and
542820	548840	gore in it, then you're probably gonna get monetized, which is kind of awful.
548840	556680	It's really, really kind of, you know, hitting the platform quite a bit with just your user
556680	557680	base.
557680	558680	Yeah, exactly.
558680	562920	Because like, if it's really stifling the type of creativity that you can do, I mean,
562920	567120	and honestly, like, if anybody's really serious about YouTube, and looking to monetization,
567120	574560	you know, that like, YouTube monetization is a massive, like, problem is just because
574560	577200	it's hit or miss with everything and all that.
577200	581040	And you're better off like doing like a Patreon or something like that, where people support
581040	587200	your channel outside of the YouTube space, because it's just, it's very unreliable, especially
587200	592720	when they make changes like this, where it's literally affecting old content that was okay
592720	594840	to put out there.
594840	600800	So one of the like, one of the folks that I watch RT gaming, he was having some issues
600800	607140	where it was there was a video that he put out, it was kind of a recap of 2022.
607140	612080	That was getting demonetized and an age restricted as well on top of it.
612080	614140	And he's like, Why?
614140	619540	Because all of the videos that were contained within it, were not demonetized or age restricted.
619540	624840	So why is this being age restricted when it's a culmination of all my videos?
624840	628220	So YouTube, so he reached out to YouTube to have that fixed.
628220	629220	And so what did they do?
629260	633460	They were like, Oh, we're going to age restrict and demonetize those other videos instead.
633460	634460	God, it's like,
635820	636820	what is it?
636820	637820	Is it violent content?
637820	642940	Or what what is it that is possibly triggering the algorithm?
642940	647320	Because that's my big thing is I'm like, YouTube relies way too much on algorithms and the
647320	650220	algorithms never side with the content creators.
650220	651420	It's really not great.
651420	658100	I don't think it was anything like super, like, I think it was just some gameplay.
658100	659100	That was causing it.
659100	665300	But it's also like other videos that have been like if they're saying if you swear too
665300	671660	much in your videos that they could also demonetize you because it's it's a lot of like bad language.
671660	677580	But there's a lot of videos where folks aren't doing that and or they're like family channels
677580	683120	are being hit with this and being taken down where it's like, but we're not doing that.
683120	684560	So why?
684560	685560	It's a good thing.
685560	688700	We were watching those old orange sounds radio episodes that are up on YouTube.
688700	691200	We were never monetized in the first place because
691200	694300	Yeah, exactly.
694300	698380	So it's like the whole partner program nonsense stuff, which is
698380	706320	Oh, I think we might have lost Loki's internet hiccup for a minute because his video froze
706320	707320	there.
707320	709840	So he'll probably catch up in a minute while his internet catches up.
709840	711220	Let me get some comments in our chat.
711220	715220	So we have DJ Rama S says, with the available tools on YouTube, they should have given the
715220	719920	content creators time to make the mandatory edits for retroactive videos instead of just
719920	721880	straight to monetizing them.
721880	725320	Yeah, there should have been some warning right for sure.
725320	729720	And then we have let's see, Bobby and chat says it's inconsistent pro ZD did a video
729720	734320	on this and didn't swear in the first 15 seconds, but then said, fuck YouTube a lot for the
734320	737060	next minute and he got demonetized.
737060	738360	So yes, exactly.
738360	739360	Yeah.
739360	740360	Oh, you're back.
740360	742360	Yeah, it's weird.
742360	743880	It just like locked up.
743880	745020	It's still kind of locked up.
745020	746020	Like no, thank you.
746020	749740	You may have to turn it off and then on again, but go ahead and finish your thought and I
749740	751860	can do some other chat comments here.
751860	752860	Yeah.
752860	757020	So it's just, it's really a, so yeah, I don't know if you heard about the thing I was saying,
757020	761900	but the change of their terms of service where they can go back now and retroactively take
761900	766520	money back from you if they find that your content is, is not monetizable.
766520	771860	So that it's, that's in their terms of service that was pointed out by gosh, I don't remember
771860	772860	the guy's name.
772880	773880	Right.
773880	774880	The repair advocate.
774880	775880	I don't know.
775880	781480	I don't remember who it was, but anyways, it's a, yeah, you got to read those terms
781480	782840	of service things.
782840	783840	It's really bad.
783840	789880	So hopefully this gets straightened out, but it doesn't look like it's going to be.
789880	792160	Somebody had made a joke in chat over it.
792160	796120	Our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network tiger call had said, if this podcast
796120	799440	was uploaded on the YouTube channel, you would have to bleep out all the cussing.
799440	802640	You know, we used to do that a long time ago.
802640	806500	In fact, Jason, our voiceover guy actually used to do a lot of hard work trying to put
806500	811060	in some like video, cause you know, we didn't do the Twitch thing for many years.
811060	816580	So some of the old episodes around, I don't know, maybe 2015, 2016 are up on YouTube.
816580	819660	And Jason did some manual video editing for those.
819660	822640	The funny thing is they might get hit for too much swearing at me.
822640	827180	It's not monetized anyway, not enough people are watching it there.
827180	832020	It might've got hit for that, but we actually have a 30 second intro to the show.
832760	836760	This would have been the old intro was still an instrumental that would take up the first
836760	838280	30 seconds.
838280	843360	So you know, that's actually a good thing to have a little intro bump because that's
843360	847960	going to prevent you from starting off your video with what the fuck, you know, it's just,
847960	851480	it's going to be very, very different there.
851480	854000	So let's see.
854000	856720	Mike Def says, yeah, I helped Jason with the timestamps too.
856720	857720	Well, that's awesome.
857720	858720	Thank you for doing that.
858720	859720	I actually had no idea.
860180	865020	But now, you know, we, we like the video to be a perk of being a subscriber over on our
865020	869660	Twitch channel over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where you can, you know, watch us
869660	874340	in the archives anytime during the week, if you want, if you want to see us or just be,
874340	878080	or if you want the free option, be here live Sunday night, even better, because then you
878080	882980	can actually chat along with the show as our folks are doing now.
882980	888940	But yeah, it doesn't, not, not a great look to be changing the rules on these folks, you
888960	890040	know, partway through.
890040	893160	It's a very, very unfortunate for sure.
893160	898200	So let's see, looking for some other comments from chat.
898200	905400	Tiger Claw says Linus Tech Tip did a WAN show, WAN show that was completely uncensored to
905400	907440	test if the stream gets demonetized.
907440	910360	Yeah, I wonder how it handles the live streams.
910360	911760	It'll be interesting.
911760	913440	Yeah, I don't know.
913440	914960	Oh, we got you back.
914960	916960	Good to see you.
916980	921420	Well, what do you, because Loki, out of the three of us, you're the one making the most
921420	922700	content for YouTube.
922700	926960	I mean, Dark Soccer Nominate may put clips or blips up there, but you're the most invested
926960	928380	in YouTube.
928380	929380	What are you, what are your feelings?
929380	934260	I mean, but you're also making Minecraft videos, which I think you don't use the F word.
934260	938460	Believe it or not, compared to this show, I get the sense you're making your videos
938460	940020	like you're making them for your kids.
940020	941340	So you kind of keep the language out of it.
941340	944340	So you're not really affected by this, but how do you feel about all this?
944400	947520	Right, I make family friendly content anyways.
947520	951360	How I feel about it is, well, if they're not pushing all these demonetized channels, why
951360	952360	aren't they pushing mine?
952360	956600	I don't, I don't make that content.
956600	958240	Can you like push mine, please?
958240	961400	Well, everyone else like struggles with their old content.
961400	966320	And that sucks for them really does it can we can we push mine, please?
966320	970280	Well, actually, actually, I am glad I think in all the times we've plugged your channel,
970280	972940	I don't know if we've ever said it's family friendly.
972940	977760	And I know we have an audience that has kids because we have plenty of people that have
977760	982360	been listening since you know, they were in high school and they now have nine and 10
982360	983620	year old kids.
983620	985320	So it's been a little while.
985320	991840	So they may be interested in Yeah, it's good to know that Loki doesn't swear on the Minecraft.
991840	995720	It's just it's a weird like, the algorithm is weird.
995720	997160	There's no rhyme or reason to it.
997160	1001500	And I think it's possible and I don't know it's all because it's all speculative since
1001500	1003320	we don't know how any of it works.
1003320	1007640	I think I may be at a detriment because I've had my channel for a long time and I had different
1007640	1013920	type of content on there years ago, not many time recently, but years ago.
1013920	1016200	And so it doesn't push it at all.
1016200	1023800	Whereas I have a fellow cast member on our server that just started putting out like
1023800	1030320	videos and also like, up to 5000 subscribers just like boom, like super fast.
1030320	1035260	And that's not a guarantee like if I like went and created a second channel and like,
1035260	1039460	put content on there, there's no guarantee that that would take off or be more successful
1039460	1040460	to backfire.
1040460	1047000	So it's just, I don't know, you just have to just like grin and take it while everybody
1047000	1052260	else just reaps the benefits of making click baby content.
1052260	1055700	Well, maybe one of these days, you'll get that thing that goes viral.
1055700	1059060	On that note, the other YouTube thing I wanted to bring up so actually has nothing to do
1059060	1062320	with any of this, but I don't know, Loki, did you see this?
1062320	1067440	So you know, our pal yyr, who often, you know, comes in our chat room and is an indie game
1067440	1068440	developer, right?
1068440	1072760	You can check out his games, yyrgames.com, I believe is a website with links to everything.
1072760	1076440	But a few games that we've talked about here on the show before pixel poops, right?
1076440	1077760	Because Loki made the unofficial sequel.
1077760	1083260	Well, no, it is official sequel, actually, pixel poops, number two, he made for the NES.
1083260	1088360	And then there's been other games like snake 360 bungee ferret tossing, which was born
1088360	1089420	of this show.
1089420	1094780	I don't think you can get that anymore, because that was on the Xbox 360.
1094780	1096420	But you know, someday it'll come back on Steam.
1096420	1101980	Anyway, my point is, he he did a game years ago, we talked about in the show, I think
1101980	1107100	that game came out in 2018, super multitasking, which, again, if you've never played this
1107100	1112100	game, because you're a little newer to orange launch radio, it's like WarioWare, but like
1112100	1117940	amped the fuck up, meaning you have to play four mini games sometimes at once, it sounds
1117940	1118940	easy.
1118940	1121880	It is not easy, because you're playing one with the buttons, one with the controller,
1121880	1122920	one with the bumpers.
1122920	1124880	So it's it's a challenge.
1124880	1129520	And I remember when I first played the game, I said, Aaron, this is because that's his
1129520	1130520	name.
1130520	1135280	I said, Aaron, this is like this game has the chance to go super viral and blow up,
1135280	1137860	you just need the right person to see it.
1137860	1139920	And it's and sure enough this week.
1139920	1142280	Now I don't follow a lot of YouTube stuff.
1142280	1147620	But I do understand the game grumps are pretty well known and have a large following and
1147620	1148740	so forth.
1148740	1152620	They played super multitasking this week on one of their videos.
1152620	1158320	So I'm when I so it was actually Jason, our voiceover guy that texted me and said, uh,
1158320	1159320	do you know about this?
1159320	1160320	And I was like, what?
1160320	1164900	I'm like, Oh, my God, no, I'm so happy for why we are I hope it pushed some sales.
1164900	1168180	I mean, I kind of skipped through the video.
1168180	1171560	And I didn't hear them mention it by name a lot, which is kind of a bummer.
1171560	1172560	But I get it.
1172560	1175280	Like, it's not really supposed to be an ad for the game.
1175280	1177240	But I did go to like this.
1177240	1181980	I went to the steam reviews for the game, and I saw two were written today.
1181980	1185440	And so that means people are seeing it because of that video.
1185440	1190260	I don't know if it's blowing up, so to speak, but it's probably getting more downloads than
1190260	1192240	it has since its launch.
1192240	1193240	Thanks to that video.
1193240	1194240	So that's pretty exciting.
1194240	1199160	Yeah, Mike Deft says even in the video, one of the grumps thought it was a new game.
1199160	1204740	Technically, super multitasking is a newer version, the game was originally just multitasking.
1204740	1208140	So super multitasking has extra stuff in it.
1208140	1209880	But anyway, congrats to YYR.
1209880	1215120	When I heard about that, I was like, you know what, I'm even if and the video is the context.
1215120	1221620	I think the title is something like, I don't want to guarantee ADHD breaks because of this
1221620	1222620	game.
1222620	1225260	Yeah, it makes a little play on ADHD.
1225260	1229700	But my understanding is the gentleman that played it actually has ADHD so he can joke
1229700	1230700	about all he wants.
1230700	1234900	At least they did a hashtag super multitasking.
1234900	1240540	But yeah, there's no link or at least a mention.
1240540	1241540	Yeah.
1241540	1244580	No, I think the title screen because I was going through it and the title screen came
1244580	1246100	up because I remember them saying something about it.
1246100	1248980	I was kind of skipping through the video because this is a long video.
1248980	1250860	And I don't know the personalities that well.
1250860	1253820	I just know they're very well liked and a lot of people watch them.
1253820	1256780	So yeah, I was very happy for Aaron to see that.
1256780	1261200	So go give that video a like and some comments and all that good stuff and because he deserves
1261200	1263340	to have that game be very successful.
1263340	1268780	And Loki, if it gets attention on his back catalog, you still have to benefit from that
1268780	1269780	too.
1269780	1274260	Because if people are like, what are the other games this guy has made the pixel poops.
1274260	1279760	There was was it there's one I saw I had a notification or I saw it.
1279760	1288120	I don't remember how it is in Twitter where somebody had just posted like that they were
1288120	1290600	I forget where they're at.
1290600	1298240	Oh, gosh, it was it was something about like they like I've reached the achievement of
1298240	1302660	like the ultimate pooper and they had filled the entire screen of one of the levels in
1302660	1308760	pixel poops number two was slapping so hard over there and they took like a picture of
1308760	1313920	it like the TV or something they were playing like games on their TV and they did a shout
1313920	1319140	out like they linked the game they just shout out with that and they also like mentioned
1319140	1324860	like hey if you bought the buzz before of all the a while back you have this already
1324860	1332280	type thing so that was cool I'm trying to remember where that was at here let's see
1332280	1340720	who said that it was because I put like I'm like I'm so proud when they did that oh it
1340720	1347480	was this guy a dead-eyed bit who had I guess he was at magfest in playing stuff with a
1347480	1354160	few people there I don't know who that is right because magfest was the indie guy yeah
1354160	1362260	so he had that it has a few pictures that's kind of cool so yeah so I guess he like
1362260	1367180	the game and you know he is playing some other like indie games as well indie NES games
1367180	1375780	so I'm glad they got to check it out and play it and yeah so well you know what YYR and
1375780	1380500	his wife had the baby not too long ago a couple years this way but not too long ago you know
1380500	1384980	they could use some additional sales of the game so you know and it just it'll motivate
1384980	1390660	him to get on the back catalog and make even more so I'm really really happy for I will
1390660	1396100	say this y'all know I'm not a fan of Twitter at this point and I'm gonna very much not
1396100	1400800	get on my soapbox but when I did hear about this I actually said you know what I'm gonna
1400800	1405660	peek at Twitter and search for super multitasking and see if it's actually trending sadly I
1405660	1410660	didn't maybe I did the search wrong I didn't really see anything about it but I maybe I
1410660	1414380	didn't wait long enough till after that video had been out I don't know so I was kind of
1414380	1421700	curious if maybe it had gotten any traction that way so but yeah so that was another random
1421700	1426080	YouTube comment but very happy for Aaron so you know he's part of the fam here at OLR
1426080	1431100	so yeah to see him get some attention all right speaking of attention let's talk about
1431100	1435700	the games that have been captivating our attention this week and how was your gaming week so
1435700	1441120	Dark Sakura we'll start with you how was your gaming week okay now I know you're muted on
1441120	1447400	discord because I see the icon I played a bunch of dead by daylight whoo I played twelve
1447400	1453920	and a half twelve and a half hours plus six hours a few days before that and I think another
1453920	1460280	six seven hours before that um I got you know got all made up so I did a sub-a-thon honestly
1460280	1467200	I didn't get as many subs as I hoped I would which um because you know I kind of need some
1467200	1474600	assistance right now um but other than other than that I had so much fun so I want to thank
1474600	1483740	first of all um Finara who was with me the majority of the day and huh yeah and then
1483740	1491200	Iseko played a couple rounds with me um I got raids from Franglish from uh uh Empire
1491200	1500880	TV one of my uh friends from uh back south um I got uh uh LC popped in to say hi it was
1500880	1505920	nice nice to see them where have they been are they just uh taking a break okay like
1505920	1512280	mental health or just yeah okay understandable just Debbie being Debbie there's other things
1512280	1520400	I think that that's that's their thing fair enough um but um uh words um I also played
1520400	1524240	with one of my new friends that I had made literally on Wednesday who was a legion who
1524240	1529600	killed us all and it turned out that this bill had been following us like breaking hooks
1529600	1535640	and fast faulting trying to you know be the last person left alive so um we ended up making
1535640	1541600	friends with with with them and uh they uh started playing with us we swift a few times
1541600	1546600	and they pretty much swift almost all day um that was uh fixation gaze or I've been
1546600	1555760	saying fixity or fixy um uh wonderful by uh non-binary streamer um uh Shayla uh who I've
1555760	1562660	met through my other friend Raven McPherse um is uh she's she's pure chaos to have and
1562660	1566200	she's so much fun she goes to all the killers wishing that they'd bring Amore and say I
1566200	1574480	love you yeah she's fun um gosh uh Vamp Bunny another friend I met through Raven uh played
1574480	1580920	with us uh we had so many friends was in uh already visited in uh just so many people
1580920	1585720	um I want to thank everybody who came in to show me support and thanks for thanks for
1585720	1590760	the uh oh my god Sia Tabiri gave me 10 gift subs so Sia Tabiri wins some artwork from
1590760	1594660	me oh that was nice of him we need to talk about the artwork I'm going to be drawing
1594660	1604440	yeah um I did a sub you did you did no honestly you did um we had so many people um that just
1604440	1609120	came in and showed me love and the subs were awesome I mean I'm not I'm not poo-pooing
1609120	1614920	what I got I'm very grateful for it I'm very grateful for it um and it was a little bit
1614920	1621680	short notice but um but AGDQ was also last week probably had a lot of eyes on that yeah
1621680	1628680	and honestly this is the I think the last week before I go back to work full time so
1628880	1635880	maybe we'll see at any rate as Gwen has mentioned in chat yeet build yeah when I was lurking
1638960	1643720	you you you all were starting that I think it was your first game where you all did that
1643720	1650000	and um but there was one before all that was the one you clipped yeah where I yeeted myself
1650000	1655540	off the hook in the basement right in front of the killer that was awesome um but anyway
1655700	1660460	so we all decided that we were going to bring Slippery Meat which gives you an extra four
1660460	1664900	percent chance to get yourself off the first hook you already have a four percent chance
1664900	1670180	and then we all brought uh jars of Salty Lips which gives you an even greater thing and
1670180	1676100	it stacks and I brought up the ante just you know to add another layer of goody of course
1676100	1683100	and with that level of uh odds being in our favor I reckon um we were getting ourselves
1683100	1690100	off of every every hook it was fantastic um and but the thing is is that we were really
1690100	1694260	doing it just because I mean we wanted to to I guess kind of piss people off which we
1694260	1701260	did we made some big angies um but then we got our friend Dr. Bot there are people who
1703260	1708220	will go out on bots and just basically because survivors will go farm their blood points
1708220	1713220	on them the bots will you know basically get the blood point for whoever set the bot up
1713220	1720220	um and then um so we got a bot and then we had an AFK Cenobite wasn't that one and then
1721220	1728220	we got the last up Ghostface yeah that was a great I'm glad they put that skin in the
1728220	1734220	game the same um I actually have been spending most of the afternoon editing that video just
1734220	1740220	for you know some time and and some silliness um because I wanted to compact it into like
1740220	1746220	the most silly in in one thing um oh my gosh Fifth Dream you're gonna be playing with us
1746220	1751220	then you're you're gonna have to swiff with us Fifth Dream is playing DBD now um at any
1751220	1758220	rate uh the we had a hell of a time getting the Ghostface to to hook us but finally we
1758220	1762220	were all just you know there's an animation where you can point and then you can kneel
1762220	1766220	down and point and so we're all kneeling down and pointing going eat eat eat eat and counting
1766220	1770220	every time um so that video will be up and I'll be linking it on my Twitter before too
1770220	1776220	long um that that was the standout game that was the standout game I had so much fun and
1779220	1785220	I made it to Silver Four in one day wow put it on your Mastodon too so I can see it
1785220	1795220	sure um but at any rate um I also did finally beat Final Fantasy 5 oh nice which means um
1795220	1802220	next Saturday if I don't take a break from the SNES stuff um I will be starting Star
1802220	1810220	Ocean as in the original Star Ocean on Super Famicom oh wow um because that's my goal with
1810220	1816220	the the retro stuff is to do RPGs that you might not have seen um you know like I did
1816220	1824220	Terranigma I did Seiken Densetsu 3 I did uh well I did Final Fantasy 4 and 6 because I
1824220	1828220	played uh Japanese translations except for 6 so it didn't work and I played Final Fantasy
1828220	1834220	5 which I freaking love Final Fantasy 5 but I forgot how long the damn X death battle
1834220	1842220	is oh my god um and who names their kid X death anyway um and then um I've been playing
1842220	1850220	Marvel Midnight Suns um yeah yeah Finara's right Terranigma most disappointing disappointing
1850220	1854220	ending since Great Expectations I will say it disappointed me the way the mist disappointed
1854220	1860220	me lower those expectations yeah but the whole game is like amazing and then um and then
1860220	1866220	anyway um I've also been playing my wordscapes just you know because I managed to solve a
1866220	1872220	complex puzzle in 10 seconds so I think I need I'm finally able to just like do words
1872220	1880220	in my sleep um uh played some pinball we hosted League um and now it's not me playing it but
1880220	1886220	I had a hand in this it's my fault blame me for this but I had a hand in this it's my
1886220	1892220	playing it but I had a hand in this it's my fault blame me for this so to give some backstory
1892220	1898220	on this uh our friend Nick Nick and Prince um had an advent calendar during the holiday
1898220	1904220	thing where you could you know put in and and win a prize on the advent calendar and I won
1904220	1914220	a bonus stream so me in my my kind and caring disposition I picked Sonic Adventure which
1914220	1920780	of course is Sonic Adventure DX on Steam and even I had forgotten how crappy the camera is in that
1920780	1928380	damn game but Nick seemed to have some fun with it I mean played almost all played up past the
1928380	1941580	egg carrier and there is a chao named Sakura and uh he was enjoying catching otters but yeah it was
1941580	1947340	I had such a good time watching Nick play and he was a really good sport about it so um I actually
1947340	1952380	do have enough points to to redeem another bonus stream but I'm not because you know I'm trying to
1952380	1958540	be kind about about the backlog but I might do Space Channel 5. Oh that'd be a good one. Yeah
1959420	1967500	so at any rate um I'm gonna I'm gonna say that the the word that sums up my uh my week is yeet!
1968060	1975100	All right uh Loki we'll go to you how was your gaming week? Um I played mostly Minecraft this
1975100	1982300	week still working on stuff um I did play some co-op um power washing sim so that was fun
1983260	1988780	and we got to do uh three I think it was three players I forgot you can co-op that game now
1989340	1994620	yeah so we did that stream with that so that that's fun so I messed around that a little bit
1994620	2001020	um yeah I mean that that's kind of it I did find something though so I've been going through
2001020	2007500	like um my sister had a bunch of stuff that my mom had kept for like old like school stuff and
2007500	2012860	there was something that happened to dig out of there that I thought was pretty funny um so and
2012860	2022220	I don't remember this but I I have a certificate of merit for capturing Carmen San Diego
2025580	2029660	uh I love it where did you get something like that's funny
2030300	2037740	I apparently make computer lab so that's uh yeah but I guess she kept everything
2039340	2046780	amazing all right um if that's it then my gaming week um still playing on the machines behind me
2046780	2050780	uh mostly the new Tron machine arcade went up I talked about last week been playing that a little
2050780	2057980	bit um and uh a lot of the usual suspects uh Final Fantasy 14 had a patch this week uh the
2057980	2063260	6.3 patch so there was a new raid which I kind of enjoyed I the mechanics were easier than the last
2063260	2067500	one uh but I liked the music in the last one a little better but you know I still like the raid
2067500	2071900	series um Shane kind of made me do it I don't always love to do the new raids the first week
2071900	2076220	because they're always kind of a white fest and people get mad but actually it was it was fine it
2076220	2084300	was tolerable so um yeah props to that and uh been doing island sanctuary which uh is my favorite
2084300	2089820	thing in Final Fantasy 14 and they just upped the level cap from 10 to 12 and they released
2089820	2096860	cosmetic gear when you get to level 12 because end game and mmos fuck raids fuck pvp it's all
2096860	2103180	about glamour cosmetics transmog and what you're wearing it's all about the fashion okay and get
2103180	2108620	this so they added two very important things that rank 12 in island sanctuary number one
2108620	2114140	an alligator mount which is which is cool that's cute but the more important thing the outfit that
2114140	2125100	you can get is now a swimming speedo outfit and I need that for my viera my my him not a himbo
2125100	2130140	but a him bunny I need my him bunny to have the speedo outfit so I'm making my way to rank 12
2130140	2135340	as soon as possible but it's uh it's a bit of a grind so uh working on that reddit's a lot of
2135340	2140700	help though with what exactly to make and when uh so you're turning you're gonna be turning your
2140700	2147020	island into like what was it the the uh the male gay equivalent of milf island or something like
2147020	2153740	that I wish I unfortunately the the the mechanics aren't that deep you can have like a friend visit
2153740	2160300	your island but the customization is still a little bit limited but I think they sort of see
2160300	2164300	how much it's catching like I don't think it was supposed to get any update with this recent patch
2164300	2168460	like they were like oh island sanctuary will get updates and even numbered patches but they did
2168460	2174860	an update anyway because I think a lot of people are more into it than they originally uh saw so
2174860	2179820	hopefully the customization options get even better and it's gonna it's gonna be an rp delight
2179820	2184780	just wait until people are doing their rave parties on the island instead of the personal
2184780	2190380	housing districts that you know that's what they do right now so there's there is that uh I've
2190380	2193340	also been playing a little bit of world of warcraft I don't know if I'm gonna renew when
2193340	2198700	this month's up though I've kind of done everything I'm gonna do in that game but I do there's things
2198700	2202540	about the mechanics in that game I kind of enjoy so I kind of enjoy kind of having both in the
2202540	2207260	rotation right now but it's keeping me from playing other games so one gotta go and the
2207260	2213580	reality is I'm always gonna pick 14 over wow right now so there's there's just that um but
2213580	2218780	I've enjoyed this latest expansion the latest expansion I think has the game in a lot better
2218780	2223340	place and I think it's especially I think the dragon flying mechanic is a great compromise
2223340	2229020	for how to fly in a new area without necessarily like just people flying from point A to point B
2229020	2233900	all the time um I think they did a good job with this expansion so you know kudos to them
2233900	2238380	um because I know it's not always been good news over there um so kudos to the teams that worked
2238380	2244700	hard on that um and then uh I played a lot more vampire survivors you know after bringing it up
2244700	2249500	on last week's episode I was like I need to to jump in and play a little more of that and uh
2250140	2255900	I for I forgot because I hadn't unlocked it yet but now I do there's a dog character that you can
2255900	2260940	play as and that by far that playing as the dog is my favorite because the dog starts with this
2260940	2265980	attack that's these like floral it looks like he's throwing flowers out or a bouquet of flowers
2265980	2270700	out or something like that but um it's very similar to the garlic attack where it like
2270700	2277260	pushes monsters away from you it's great so um I uh yeah I'll be playing a lot more as the dog but
2277260	2282060	the game encourages you to kind of cycle through the different characters so uh yeah thank gosh
2282060	2287420	for cloud saves between pc and xbox series x because of my controller issues I had to switch
2287420	2293180	over to playing vampire survivors on series x but um it picked up my old save which is great
2293180	2297660	there's a ton of achievements everything you can do in vampire survivors is like a five-point
2297660	2301420	achievement so there's like 140 achievements or something like that in the game it's pretty wild
2301420	2307420	so I've been having fun unlocking all those that's for sure so uh dark Tetsuya keep at it it's it's
2307420	2311980	a roguelike like anything else so just remember every because dark Tetsuya said I'm stuck in the
2311980	2316220	second area I haven't been able to pass it so kind of put vampire survivors back on the shelf
2316220	2321100	go back to the first area and earn some more coins and buy yourself some power ups some new
2321100	2325100	characters because that's that's what a roguelike's all about right when you can't get over the hill
2325820	2331500	try to invest the money to help get you over the hill so um it'll uh it'll get there it's it's it
2331500	2335580	is difficult at first the game's kind of designed like that but once you once you're able to get
2335580	2339260	some runs where you really get the money pouring in and you can really kind of buy yourself a
2339260	2345660	better starting build you're going to be in a great place so uh yeah it'll be fun so um yeah
2345660	2350460	that's pretty much it for my gaming week nothing really new yet but I am eyeing my backlog on what
2350460	2354700	can I stream and catch up on because I'm honestly looking at the latest expedition no man's sky and
2354700	2359900	I'm just kind of like you know I missed an expedition now I think that train derailed
2359900	2364220	I'll try the new expedition whatever that comes out but I'm looking to stream some other stuff
2364220	2369260	I have a huge game backlog to catch up on there's things like tunic I still really need to play so
2369260	2372780	I'll probably do a stream of that in the coming weeks so it just depends on my availability
2373660	2378300	all right well talking about new games to stream or not stream or otherwise
2378300	2381980	we're going to get to our top story I do want to mention real quick before we get into headlines
2381980	2386700	because we usually do uh like housekeeping and show updates um I've mentioned this before we're
2386700	2394700	not going to be here February 26th uh I'm going to be on a cruise that week um the Star Trek
2394700	2398940	Cruise which I've talked about before get this though so you know I talked about it on the show
2398940	2405180	the other week I was very excited because Kate Mulgrew is coming back this year guess what right
2405180	2409740	after we went off the air I got the alert she cancelled she had to pull out due to a filming
2409740	2420460	commitment they replaced her with Shatner yay I'm so oh god that sucks Rob I'm sorry I'm so
2420460	2429340	pressed I'm so pressed about it but you know what that's just you know what if when that programming
2429340	2434140	is going on there it's not like there isn't 500 other things to do on a cruise ship I can go do
2434140	2438940	something else it's fine and they got they got one of the um voice actors from Prodigy to come
2438940	2443020	as well which I thought was kind of cool um and they're still like Doug Jones is still going and
2443020	2447100	that's the the big one I can't wait to meet and get autographed with so it's not it's not all bad
2447100	2457740	news but it's like talk about a fucking downgrade anyway all right uh tiger class says probably to
2457740	2461900	record another season to start her prodigy well they got one of the other voice people there so
2461900	2468300	I don't know but they I'm sure they all record at different times so who knows all right Fanara says
2468300	2473100	everyone run to one side of the cruise ship and fling yourself overly dramatically at the railing
2474060	2478300	when you know who starts fucking reminiscing and talking about the good old days I'm sure
2478300	2484620	I'll do just that anyway let's move on to other happier topics and Loki as I was mentioning uh
2484620	2491980	new games potentially right yeah so we're going to be getting a um Microsoft um I don't want to
2491980	2498300	call it a direct a oh okay I guess they're calling it developer direct um a developer direct uh
2498380	2506460	featuring Bethesda and Xbox titles um on January 25th it's going to take place at 3 p.m eastern
2506460	2513180	12 p.m pacific and they're going to be focusing on upcoming xbox games like forza motorsports
2513180	2519260	minecraft legends red fall and as well as new content for elder scrolls online
2519820	2524140	um probably no mention of starfield because I'm sure I'll be delayed again
2524620	2531660	um yeah so we'll have to wait and see what they show there uh I gotta be honest with like minecraft
2531660	2537900	legends like I was minecraft legends funny enough is pulling an elder scrolls online with me
2537900	2547340	the more I see of it the less interested in it I am so that's it's it's I hope they show something
2547340	2552460	that makes it look interesting please or just mention anything about minecraft because it's
2552540	2559660	been absolutely radio silent since October I bet they will this this is a good time to give an
2559660	2568780	update well you know they said that their next update is going to be focused around story or
2569340	2577260	focused around things that will help you tell your story they put out a trailer today or not
2577260	2585420	today this week showing off the microsoft or the the minecraft store features like as in the
2585420	2596060	content that you can buy through there that will help you tell your story I have reservations about
2596060	2605260	all that so by tell your story you mean give me money meaning the the the next big update is
2605260	2611020	moving store to java edition so that you guys can pay for things too which no one will because
2611020	2616140	it's the java edition there's so much content out there that we don't need to do that but
2617260	2624220	you know I mean they're gonna try we'll see all right yeah well we'll have to we'll have to check
2624220	2628220	it out I'm assuming it'll be a deep dive on starfield as well we'll actually get to see a
2628220	2632700	little more of the gameplay because you know we've we've really not seen a lot of gameplay
2633100	2639580	uh we'll get a deep dive in the delay for starfield I'm sure you think again I think
2639580	2644380	again in an alternate universe we're playing that game right now it came out november 2022
2644380	2650300	so uh you think it'll get delayed again that's a pretty bold prediction I think it'll be
2650300	2654780	microsoft I think it's gonna be some first party stuff to come out you know there's some
2654780	2658380	big rumors out there and I think somebody had just posted it to our discord as well over at
2658380	2663740	vognetwork.com slash discord big rumors that scale bounds making a comeback scale bound got
2663740	2669740	uncancelled and platinum games working on it so apparently like there was a note it says on here
2669740	2676220	that microsoft has noted that the uh the standalone show for starfield is in the works
2676780	2680860	um oh interesting one that will dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive
2681100	2684380	hmm correct in a few months once once the delay is over
2687260	2691740	for their sake I hope not but at the same time right you want the game to be good so don't
2691740	2699260	release a crap product it's coming out q4 yeah I'm sorry all right we'll see well you know what
2699260	2704300	it would be interesting if if the microsoft overlords uh finally forced bethesda to put
2704300	2709260	out a non-buggy product it'll be uh that'll be newsworthy in and of itself to be quite honest
2709260	2714780	we'll be we'll already be in starships by the time that happens like actual starships actual
2714780	2723260	starships yeah all right jefferson starship uh finara says isn't it par to put out unfinished
2723260	2728860	stuff these days yes but well that is true the internet will rake over the coals for that
2728860	2733820	especially when there's early previews of stuff and there have been games that have their sales
2733820	2738300	that get impacted because you know that first week sales is really important it's like a movie right
2739100	2745260	halo infinite i mean like it there is like they really like microsoft needs to take a page from
2745260	2751660	sony's book and release products that are polished like actually polished and not buggy when they
2751660	2756860	come out like you know horizon or god of war and all that stuff they need to release like actual
2756860	2764780	quality product that is finished and halo infinite was a bad start i mean obviously so other games i
2764780	2770620	think like forza and stuff have been pretty good but also they kind of had to 180 during development
2770620	2775500	because of the original feedback so there there is that so we're already yeah i had a bad start there
2775500	2781020	but like i mean but they need to like with a big tentpole title like something like that they
2781020	2787820	really need to focus on making sure that is absolutely perfect they did not do that this time
2788620	2794940	they did quite the opposite but um maybe the next game will be better fable you know or something
2794940	2799980	like that oh i'd love to see more on fable i hope we get that in this direction i would too i would
2799980	2804700	be very excited especially considering who's making it you know in their track record i'd love that
2804700	2810380	so all right well in the meantime let's talk about things that have leaked to the internet
2810380	2815980	uh an interesting pair of leaks uh that happened this last week the first one had to do with valve
2815980	2821980	and an asset repository leak so basically what happened with this is that uh content for team
2821980	2829020	fortress 2 that was cut and uh some other things on like the half-life games they all hit uh the
2829020	2834540	web this week uh in a leak and of course the original story i had linked is not working for
2834540	2839100	me right now but that's okay because i can switcharoo on the fly here uh it also included
2839100	2843660	stuff from portal and counter strike source but i believe the vast majority of it was cut things
2843660	2855020	from team fortress 2 um and uh so uh there's uh never before seen maps models psds vmfs 61 gigs
2855020	2860540	of content for team fortress 2 this is the last official team fortress 2 content drop anyone will
2860540	2866380	see is uh what's apparently the leaker have been holding on to these two for uh since 2016 at
2866380	2873820	least that's what they're claiming so um there you go so nothing about anything with a three in
2873820	2879020	it so don't get carried away but you know people are kind of looking at like oh here's some stages
2879020	2882060	and things that were supposed to be in the game that didn't quite make it through and little
2882060	2889500	things like that also very interesting uh mortal kombat 2 had some leaks that you know the source
2889500	2896700	code and this is you remember red red uh radon yeah like this this uh source code leaked uh
2896700	2901340	of course github got a takedown request for the source code from warner brothers discovery because
2901340	2905420	of course they did but you know the old saying once it's on the internet it's always on the
2905420	2910700	internet uh there's also not just source code that leaked but there are assets that also leak to the
2910700	2915580	internet that show a new johnny cage fatality which i thought was very interesting it looks
2915580	2922140	like he either like rips their face off or rips their brain out uh in this fatality and uh it may
2922140	2926700	have been a little much even for that i mean you know obviously that's nothing for those games now
2926700	2932780	but maybe in the 90s that game's older than most of the people playing it yeah so uh it's
2932780	2937980	interesting that the that's uh all been unearthed but otherwise i didn't think a lot of i mean if
2937980	2944140	you are super into the mortal kombat games then like every frame every like move that possibly
2944140	2948140	got deleted or something is very interesting but i think for the casual fan it's kind of like
2948140	2952300	it's not like there's anything super like there's no like missing characters or anything like that
2952300	2958860	outside of that uh one fatality really some really neat animations though like the spin attack from
2958860	2965020	baraka yeah yeah that thing was pretty cool there was a uh a radon move that looked like
2965020	2971100	his original fatality that looks like it was cut too which is interesting so there were um now i'm
2971100	2975900	gonna just throw a little backstory in this i was living you know in alabama when this game came out
2975900	2981100	and we took a trip up the east coast um it was the trip i went to new york uh got to play at carnegie
2981100	2988300	hall um but anyway they had a lot of test units like of different builds for mortal kombat 2
2989020	2996300	um so this was like in 93 and um like there were even like early nba jam you know cabinets still
2996300	3001900	out around the time too so some of this stuff like i remember seeing on early units like we
3001900	3007580	still we still found machines that you could do like infinite uh katana loop on and all of that
3007580	3013340	it was it there were just some things like oh i think i saw that or you know it just sort of
3013340	3017900	hit some of those things for me it was pretty cool yeah so kind of kind of a nice look back
3017900	3022140	especially considering how old the game is right now i i'm like the source code isn't really
3022140	3027740	hurting anybody but you know whatever i guess warner brothers feels the need to i mean i get
3027740	3032700	it because like you know it is and they're still selling mortal kombat 2 and these arcade one-up
3032700	3037340	machines for one and there were rumors about those hd remasters some time ago although i don't think
3037340	3042140	they ever came to fruition i think it got canceled like most things at warner brothers discovery but
3042140	3047340	um you know it's it's it feels like this isn't really hurting anyone but i understand they have
3047340	3050940	to protect their trademark and all that but it's on the internet now if you want to go find all
3050940	3055740	this stuff i think that the the discovery of what's been cut is it's not going to hurt anyone
3055740	3061820	now but you know it's interesting that's all anyway dark sakura let's go uh to you for
3061820	3068380	something a little more modern well um i i was actually going to go find it but i put it away
3068380	3078460	somewhere um google is giving us another lovely little handout um as the ship sinks um if you've
3078460	3083340	got a stadia controller they're going to be unlocking um uh well they're going to release
3083340	3087260	a tool that will enable bluetooth support on the stadia controller so that you can use it for other
3087260	3092540	things so not only did you get the controller for a free but it's now bluetooth capable at least it
3092540	3103420	will be um it's it's just pretty pretty happy news you know i think that uh you know rather than
3103420	3108220	having i mean i never was going to consider it a paperweight because honestly i play with
3108220	3113180	a lot of my controllers wired um just because i have a lot of different things that can cause
3113180	3120780	interference um but i mean i absolutely love that it's a controller that i i've been able to use on
3120780	3126380	my ipad with little problem um i mean this is this is my regular controller is a steel series
3126780	3133660	and um my stadia controller is just as hefty and feels just as good in my hands so
3133660	3139820	it's a very comfortable controller to use so i'm i'm pretty pretty happy about that um
3140620	3149420	uh i mean we've got two days now until uh until the shutdown no one day i think it's tomorrow
3149420	3155340	isn't it yeah i don't know i'm following so yeah i knew it was coming up real real soon though
3155340	3161580	real soon though oh yeah and i've already gotten of course my my refund in november um
3161580	3167100	bobby blackwolf says wednesday the 18th is the final day okay so dawn of the final day 72 hours
3167100	3174700	remain you know what i might have to do a farewell stadia stream um when i play except i'm trying to
3174700	3183820	do achievements but maybe maybe i'll do a recorded video of me launching into stadia one last time
3183820	3193020	yeah you might as well yeah so at any rate um i i'm still very disappointed especially with
3193020	3202060	the announcement of the uh the chrome book um and i don't i don't know i'm just
3204300	3209420	hey bobby is mentioning about huh oh no i was just to say hey at least they refunded the money
3209420	3214780	you know i'll give them a lot of props for that and the fact that they are unlocking the bluetooth
3214780	3220540	on this because um and not everybody may know this but um those controllers they work through wi-fi
3220540	3225260	so the controller didn't connect to your computer connected to your wi-fi so that it could get to
3225260	3229500	the server faster basically which is you know it's a pretty clever way to do the streaming device
3229500	3237020	yeah i mean it was awesome it was fantastic on my ipad i mean screw dbd mobile you know i was
3237020	3243980	playing the real thing so um but then i was just saying for them to do this they really are doing
3243980	3248940	something extra and it actually reduces e-waste because a lot of those things would have ended
3248940	3256940	up in the garbage well um to go back to what i was uh gonna say before um bobby mentioned um
3257660	3262620	uh that he's considering getting a stream deck uh and said and might make the stadia controller
3262620	3267740	my doc steam deck controller um i'm not getting a steam deck yet not until dead by daylight has
3267740	3275820	support on it um and it's the whole anti-cheat thing vhs uses it too and it doesn't like uh
3275820	3281980	any of the unix systems or any arm architecture for that matter and then to answer dj run the s
3281980	3287500	about a chromebook um yeah so like what was it like a week two weeks after they announced the
3287500	3294140	stadia closure um they announced then that they were making a series of chromebooks geared toward
3294140	3300700	cloud gaming and i'm like really really google really if you were gonna be giving me all this
3300700	3307580	money back and i'm getting on my dlc and cosmetics and crap for free nah nah brah you don't do that
3308940	3314620	so yeah that was that was the bullshit and you have as far as cloud gaming goes you you have
3314620	3320460	kind of settled on nvidia right now right is now your yeah i did i wanted to like boosteroid but
3320460	3325180	there's a couple of things about it is that number one the server connection is terrible
3325180	3333580	i don't think they have any u.s servers um i mean it's good for folks who are in uh in europe
3333580	3340220	really good for folks in india because they have uh support for indian servers um but not very good
3340220	3346060	over here and they were being way too slow to get a matt client out um i mean the customer service
3346060	3350380	were all great people the people that i dealt with and i really wanted to like it but i couldn't swing
3350380	3361180	it so um i have the the um the regular tier the the 10 bucks a month here for uh g-force and i
3361180	3367260	honestly like it except i hate that it forces you into full screen i hate playing in full screen
3367260	3373660	especially when i i got this big ass monitor so that i could play in windowed mode and have my
3373660	3380780	stream stuff in some place and have this another and it's bullshit however i'm gonna tell all you
3380780	3388380	you know the other five people who play uh games on a mac there's way around it and that's you you
3388380	3395420	get your your window where you want it to be where you you know want to play on it and then when the
3395420	3402460	game goes into full screen wait just a little bit and then do uh control up and that shows you your
3402460	3408780	multiple desktops and full screen windows count as their own desktop so you can go hover to the
3408780	3414700	top of your desktop and then go to the top left hand corner of the nvidia window you get a little
3414700	3423500	double arrow you hit that and it will trick it into being windowed just don't try to move it or
3423500	3428780	it will not move the way that you want it to do that's what i'm saying get in position first and
3428780	3436700	that is how you get that's how you get around uh it forcing you into full screen hacks now with um
3438220	3445820	with uh boosteroid funny enough in chrome it forced full screen in safari it didn't
3446540	3453260	so i wanted i wanted to like it i really i really wanted to to give the the smaller guys you know
3453820	3463260	a little bit of uh of a joy but alas right um but i mean i really my games look great um the
3463260	3469500	only thing is that because i'm actually in a decreased full screen technically is that it
3469500	3475020	does come up a little pixely um for me just changing aspect ratios like that but for the
3475180	3482620	but for the most part like when i'm in game it's it's beautiful it's smooth um i only get a little
3482620	3489100	bit of lag and and i haven't had a very long wait to get into into my games uh for q like i think
3489100	3496700	the longest ad was six people i'm also playing marvel's midnight suns on it okay and um it's
3496700	3503980	beautiful no problems at all i i i'm enjoying it and the service is far better than i it was
3503980	3511980	the first time i tried it so thumbs up all right well let us move on to uh some less happy news
3511980	3519420	coming out of another company right loki yeah ubisoft has been they've been on a roll with
3519420	3526780	delaying and canceling things so they've again because apparently fans of this game are used to
3526780	3531100	disappointment they have decided to delay skull and bones yet again sorry pirates you're not
3531100	3537260	going to build a pirate until you know later i guess i think the game was announced originally
3537260	3546540	like five years ago like it was a while ago um but yeah so that's been delayed now um also
3547260	3552860	they have announced that they are canceling several other games that i think were maybe even
3552860	3561580	unannounced yet um so and they're saying right now they're the reason is they want to focus on
3561580	3567340	like like super franchises or something like that basically like really powerful franchises
3567340	3574060	i think the problem is that all of their games kind of repeat a certain um
3575020	3583900	pattern i guess uh a certain structure of um you know towers that you climb and uh
3583900	3589020	outposts and every single one kind of has the same type of gameplay and people are getting
3589020	3596060	sick of that and so maybe that's kind of what is causing problems but i don't know
3597500	3602620	i mean that sucks that they're canceling stuff too bad one of those things that they're canceling
3603500	3608060	is not easy come on you know who hasn't addressed any of the sexual harassment
3608060	3614860	charges and uh misogyny that's going on in their company but you know everything else
3615820	3622140	business as usual i guess if i rolled my eyes any harder at him i think i would pull something
3622700	3627500	uh there was one game though that we can't confirm that was uh cancelled was was the vr
3627500	3635340	splinter cell game but i don't know they've released weirder vr games remember that eagle
3635340	3640620	game that they had i never played that but i bought it but i mean i can say that about
3640620	3646780	hundreds of games i have it is interesting to see them scaling back on a lot of that though um
3647420	3651820	just not assassin's creed though remember all the three titles that they announced last time
3652460	3657660	yeah gotta go where the money is right uh quest buster in chat says beyond good and evil 2 has
3657660	3662380	entered the chat uh as an assassin's creed fan myself some of the bloat in the later games was
3662380	3667020	getting a bit much yeah well that's the thing i think they were saying that their next assassin's
3667020	3672540	creed game they wanted to like slim down a little bit as well because yeah it was getting too too
3673500	3680300	big so we'll see i don't know i honestly the last time i was excited about an ubisoft game was
3682380	3688540	far maybe one of the far cries i've been excited about far cry in a long time though so
3689980	3696860	i don't know all right well let's talk about an interesting test feature on xbox uh this is
3696860	3702860	something that's being tested right now it's an active hours sleep option so it's in the xbox
3702860	3707340	insider program right now which is kind of like their beta testing mechanism and in this you can
3707420	3711980	have your console shut down not sleep but shut down at times where you aren't using it and this
3711980	3716140	will cut down on your energy use which is pretty cool not that these things use a ton of energy
3716140	3720780	when they're sleeping but you know it adds up so it's nice to do that you can actually manually
3720780	3724700	schedule those hours if you kind of know like these are the times i play these are times i don't
3724700	3731740	but there's also an automatic option if you want the console console to adapt to what you tend to
3731740	3737580	do so it'll get take its best guess best based on when you play it this is going to be automatically
3737580	3745180	enabled on these systems too usually we aren't fans of these types of automatic opt-in sims uh
3745180	3750620	systems but i see the greater good they're going for with this you know if they're using less
3750620	3755740	energy overall and you know trying to you know contribute to making it greener then okay i i
3755740	3760540	think this is a fair thing to opt people into because you can opt out if you want to the xbox
3760540	3764700	one however will default to always active and you have to configure that yourself i'm assuming
3764700	3769340	that's probably just something to do with maybe the hardware or whatever just the age so there's
3769340	3775900	also a shut down energy saving option that uses 20 times less power than sleep while still allowing
3775900	3781660	the overnight updates to the xbox and the games so that's kind of neat so you know you know what's
3781660	3789660	had that for a very long time mac os well and and it's important to note in microsoft's camp
3789660	3796380	windows 11 also has a similar feature so there's it's nice to see everybody coming to the uh
3796380	3807340	greenery table it's been here for years all right um moving on star soccer what else has been here
3807340	3813180	for you um uh another company that for the longest time forgot how to count to three
3813980	3820460	um capcom now this is cool i actually sent this to to dan like right away um capcom has
3820460	3826140	announced the street fighter 35th anniversary live concert it's a first time a concert for
3826140	3830540	street fighter apart from you know that that cool group that played at twitch con that was pretty
3830540	3840300	cool um but uh it is going to be uh taking place on january 29th 20 uh 23 at line cube shibuya

3913020	3917740	fighter 5 theme of dan cap tuna range chief writer 5 we heard them play that
3918700	3924380	i may have some of that um on my phone that was the one they were doing live that was pretty
3924380	3936700	pretty random for a uh a what was keynote but hey neat kind of um i mean they uh street fighter
3936700	3944220	6 was a co-sponsor for twitch con yeah true all right uh luke's theme uh uh taking aim

3974780	3981100	event art and i might i might have to make this happen all right i like that they're letting
3981100	3985660	people participate virtually too since not everybody can just go to japan to see this
3985660	3992620	so that's pretty cool i need to see if i can find that website all right well let's move on we have
3992620	3997740	another story that um this is one of those things i'm kind of actually surprised with still going
3997740	4005740	but uh loki yeah so uh i i forgot about this as well because i i don't really use this but um
4005740	4012780	gog connect which was a service that allowed you to basically um i think wasn't this the one that
4012780	4017260	you allowed you to kind of import your different libraries from different things and allowed you
4017260	4023180	to have one launcher yep well i mean we should have known better that that's never gonna work
4023180	4027740	because especially when we're all sitting here going well i forgot about it and to be clear it's
4027740	4034300	not gog galaxy the actual like storefront in that launcher like that's right closed yeah yeah this
4034300	4038940	is the the launcher that basically combined all your libraries together you know like the good
4038940	4045260	thing that really it should be set up that way but um no i i didn't realize this was a service
4045260	4050780	i thought it would be like a piece of software but uh yeah it's not going to be they're going
4050780	4057820	to be discontinuing that as well so it's officially been killed off um it has a good point uh saying
4057820	4062060	i used it once but it was cool to get the extras from the gog versions that's true because the gog
4062060	4067420	versions often had like maybe a soundtrack or a digitized manuals and some other like cool little
4067420	4073340	embellishments that steam doesn't always have yeah so i mean that's cool if it was like unlocking
4073340	4078460	stuff and i could see like you know where they may have where you basically like copies of the
4078460	4084780	game or something like that but um yeah i don't know it still would be nice to have like a piece
4084780	4088620	of software that combined the libraries but at the same time like i don't find it massively
4088620	4093580	inconvenient either it's just i kind of forget what i have on certain platforms sometimes
4095180	4101500	all right well rip that service that we probably should have been checking in on more often because
4101500	4107580	sometimes you don't know what you got till it's gone so there's that all right um boy oh boy i'm
4107580	4111740	gonna admit i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this but all of you on discord were
4111740	4116060	really lighting up about this that i wanted to bring it up on the show even if it isn't directly
4116060	4121740	about video games it's certainly something that inspires shit tons of video games and that is
4122380	4128700	what's going on in the dungeons and dragons world and uh wizards of the coast this week uh i guess
4128940	4135740	there was a leaked version of their open games license that leaked out and the changes were
4135740	4140540	interpreted that third-party publishers were going to be hurt and profits were going to increase of
4140540	4144700	course that's what these things are the ones that are not popular always go this way right
4145420	4153420	what the ogl is is it allows you to use aspects of dnd mechanics to create royalty-free content
4153500	4158620	so for example they're that you do these things called splat books which i'm not familiar with
4158620	4164460	that but they say that critical role which is a hugely popular show has one so i'm assuming
4164460	4172060	they're like fan campaigns or something that you can like make and sell basically uh right now um
4172060	4176380	and artistia says i think it came up in discord oh yeah y'all went off in discord which i wanted
4176380	4180220	to bring it up on the show because i do listen even if i don't always understand because i don't
4180540	4186860	play any dnd currently but i certainly recognize that without it we wouldn't have role-playing
4186860	4192540	games in the same state that we do now japanese or american like dnd has been hugely influential
4192540	4201660	on all of it so anyway um so there's third-party tabletop content thanks to this ogl and all of
4201660	4209580	this so wizards of the coast announced one dnd which was a rules update and an online integration
4209580	4216380	that was going to be pushed alongside the fifth edition content but when they announced dnd beyond
4217180	4221260	this was when they recognized that there was going to be changes to the existing ogl
4221260	4226460	and there was skepticism because there's clause about royalties and if you make more than 750
4226460	4233660	000 then that was going to be part of that but then there was another article that came out on
4233660	4240780	january 5th that apparently the ogl 1.1 was almost 10 times the original document in size
4240780	4245660	and that it completely voided the original ogl so it's kind of almost going back to the youtube
4245660	4253020	thing it's changing all the rules after the fact so that the original ogl no longer is an authorized
4253020	4259580	license agreement so sucks to be you if you made something under that so for companies like paizo
4260380	4265740	that are is like a third-party creator that makes content around this this could have fucked them
4265740	4272380	royally and if you don't sign up for the new new ogl you can't make any income at all off the
4272380	4278140	products so of course people lost their fucking mind which you know people tend to do with changes
4278140	4283180	but when you retroactively change the rules rightfully so people are losing their mind
4284140	4291660	the creator of the original ogl and a former vice president of wizards of the coast ryan dancy went
4291660	4296860	on to say the original license was never intended to be rescinded and then a third-party publisher
4296860	4302540	cobalt press said that their open source rule set called project black i'm sorry it was announced it
4302540	4307580	wasn't they announced project black flag basically like we're gonna make your own fucking dnd
4308460	4314220	which some somewhat similar to what happened on twitter and mastodon even though that actually
4314220	4319980	that mastodon's a few years old at this point but it was to create something better well and
4319980	4325660	yeah the thing is is they they would know about it too because they were there they were the ones
4325660	4330460	that like helped draft the original agreement in the first place like some of these people
4330460	4335820	including their legal counsel and stuff so and let me point out wizards of the coast actually
4335820	4345740	had their own rpg system while dnd was uh still under tsr um so uh and then they bought i mean
4345740	4349420	there's probably a lot more i'm not going to go in the backstory i'm doing a very very simple story
4350060	4357420	but i mean that's just sort of like how how soon they forget yeah how soon they forget
4357980	4362380	so has bro tasbro pushing it just to give you yeah just to give you a sense of the rest of
4362380	4368380	the timeline on january 10th wizards posted to the dnd beyond twitter account saying more info
4368380	4372940	to come soon in other words read between the lines stop losing your fucking minds we're
4372940	4379020	asking the lawyers for an update but on january 12th piezo that third party responded and said
4379020	4386460	we're going to do our own system neutral open license a new open perpetual and irrevocable
4386540	4393500	irrevocable i can never say that word irrevocable uh open rpg creative license or orc for short
4393500	4399900	isn't that cute um and basically saying this is a key word there the one i can't pronounce right
4399900	4406620	that they can never pull it back irrevocable irrevocable so that uh wizards of the coast
4406620	4409980	obviously tried to make the change that's the biggest pain point there so that's very
4409980	4417340	interesting as well uh this orc license would be developed under uh azora law which is a firm that
4417340	4421980	specializes in intellectual property basically making sure that they walk that fucking fine
4421980	4430140	line and don't copy anything so um yeah principle is six as heck i'm about to fire up some dnd into
4430140	4435420	the stream and lurk in my stream if i host one yeah but then i said if i ever hosted a game
4435420	4442060	i only do second edition yeah um and yes i'm i'm i'm trying to get to the rest of the timeline
4442060	4445420	finara but everybody's getting their opinion which is fine which that's how we work here
4445420	4452700	so um wizards of the coast finally did a response january 13th so two days ago saying that the
4452700	4457740	changes were never intended to limit or prohibit players or aspiring desire designers were taking
4457740	4463580	their own work what they were trying to prevent and honestly i you know and again being a little
4463580	4468540	bit more of an outsider in this situation this was the right thing to say they were trying to
4468540	4475900	prevent web 3 and nft products based on dnd rules okay that's jumping up that's a reasonable
4475900	4484700	response yes the way you did it yeah the way you did it not so great but i if it took you three
4484700	4490220	days to come up with the best possible response then so be it uh they also do not want their
4490220	4495740	content appearing in hateful and discriminatory discriminatory products also certainly
4495740	4500940	understandable and they want major corporations to not use the ogl and commercial releases
4500940	4507260	so the new ogl will be reconfigured to specify that it covers only content for tabletop rpgs
4507260	4513580	and thus shouldn't impact the rest of the fan content out there live streams cosplay for charity
4513580	4519660	wizards and hasbro's trying to say you're safe and with all this stuff so but you know
4520940	4527500	as the story goes it doesn't matter what you intended it matters what is perceived so it
4527500	4531900	will be interesting to see if they can push back or if they can get back from this because now
4531900	4538220	this orc thing is started this project black flag is started that's that's a faucet you can't turn
4538220	4544140	off now at this point so wizards is already going to pay a price for this even if they are able to
4544140	4549500	calm people down going no no we're just trying to say fuck those nft guys with the rest of you oh
4549500	4559340	okay so anyway for life dark soccer is holding up her second edition players handbook there
4559340	4567260	um uh fanara in chat says to quote wizards of the coast we rolled a one yes yeah so
4568220	4576540	anyway it'll be interesting to see what happens all right uh join the conversation on our discord
4576540	4583660	if you'd like to over at vog network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord um fixation gaze uh
4583660	4588940	is in our chat hello hello saying my new friend it's it's our legion now wizards and hasbro
4588940	4597020	wanted to steal art under a license they wanted free use of any art that was posted so you know
4597020	4603020	and again when you do things without explaining them which is what hasbro did you allow the
4603020	4608620	internet to come up with the conclusions that they're drawing whether that was what was intended
4608620	4613580	or not and it certainly does point out you know again if this was hasbro's intention or not
4614940	4621260	it still looks shitty so uh tiger call with another interesting perspective saying this is
4621260	4627340	going to affect the box office for the upcoming dnd movie because people will not see it in spite
4627340	4631660	cause of what happened wait wait wait i missed this they're doing another one weren't the last
4631660	4637260	two attempts like because krull was supposed to be a dnd movie and i love krull don't get me wrong
4637260	4641900	it has amazing actors and amazing scenes in it but it's not very cohesive and then the actual
4641900	4647100	dnd movie that came out i enjoyed it because it was stupid but it wasn't very good either
4648140	4653260	and now they're doing another one yes and and chris pine plays a bard
4654060	4662780	i do want to see it it looks good i saw the trailer it looks okay it's no megan but you know
4664700	4671500	it's no cocaine bear but you know yeah uh other comments in chat uh fixation case clarifying this
4671500	4676380	was actually brought up in a whistleblowing email they did intend to steal from the community oh
4676460	4684060	that's yeah that's a yikes those emails getting leaked as yeah again i'm not like an avid player
4684060	4690140	of dnd currently so i'm not following this as closely but that's that's a yike that was why a
4690140	4697980	lot of people were leaving deviantart because deviantart had i think some option that if your
4697980	4703340	artwork was uploaded on their website they could make like a certain profit off of selling off some
4703340	4710460	of your artwork which funny enough i also i saw this in our discord somebody's suing deviantart
4710460	4716140	and all of those ai art companies about stealing all the artwork and i i should have occurred to
4716140	4721100	me it's only a matter of time before someone does that and here we are so somebody's suing
4721100	4725660	not only deviantart but all those ai companies over the ai stolen artwork basically the only
4725660	4731420	reason i didn't cancel my account there is because i do enjoy seeing what some of my favorite
4731420	4738460	comic book artists are doing and getting stuff to use in daz 3d but like my artwork all every
4738460	4744540	last piece of art i have ever done on deviantart has been removed yeah i i used to host my portfolio
4744540	4751340	there no i remember those days yeah yeah my i had some decent stuff on my portfolio back in the day
4751340	4756380	but i do a lot better work now don't sell yourself short um no it was it was pretty crappy i was very
4756380	4763340	new it's like me going back to read my old live journal i'm like oh god because actually there
4763340	4768540	was a conversation that led me to go look at live journal oh somebody in the orange channel in
4768540	4773980	discord they were talking about why was there an episode this and an episode 0.5 and i went to my
4773980	4778780	live journal to find out oh that was when i was traveling for work and it was i was at katsu khan
4778780	4783180	one weekend and traveling for work the next weekend and loki did like a solo show that
4783180	4786540	weekend so it was like a point five because you must have been indisposed as well dark
4786540	4791180	soccer or something happened because loki did a solo show so anyway oh my god i actually forgot
4791180	4795740	my login i want to get just a couple other comments on this from some folks that play
4795740	4800380	dnd a little more right now uh and then we'll move on to our next topic uh quest buster says
4800940	4806220	expanding on fixation gaze's point the new ogl had language that allowed wizards of the
4806220	4812060	coast to publish your work anywhere they wanted without paying you also if your ip under ogl 1.1
4812060	4817260	made less than 50k you had to report those numbers you were literally landing handing
4817260	4823100	the keys to your livelihood to wizards of the coast and fixation gaze uh piggybacked on that
4823100	4829420	saying exactly they are backtracking so i would also like to point out that youtube sort of has
4829420	4836700	something very similar going on um is that with any content that's posted on youtube they can
4836700	4844140	take that content and reuse it as an ad on another site that's how they do their ads on um
4845020	4849740	on facebook for example without at all letting you know about it
4852540	4860060	wow wow so all right yeah all right well it's in their tsc let's take a trip back to simpler times
4860060	4865980	when uh you know there there were no nfts and uh we if you wanted to change the rules of the game
4866140	4871500	you literally couldn't do a patch so uh and and back to a time when people were still
4871500	4878780	playing second edition dnd on a massive scale let's get to the bump this is this isn't that old
4878780	4883020	okay maybe third edition here we go um
4883020	4897020	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull
4897020	4901980	out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week
4904380	4910140	and dark soccer what did you pick tonight it picked a game called retro city rampage which
4910140	4917020	has a great name um so at any rate um this is an action adventure game that was developed by
4917020	4925260	v blank entertainment it's a parody of retro games from the 80s and 90s and also they're the the pop
4925260	4930700	culture that went with those eras and grand theft auto and very similar games it was released on the
4930700	4940380	playstation 3 the ps vita and uh windows in 2012 with later ports on other systems the enhanced
4940380	4948380	version retro city rampage dx was released for the nintendo 3ds in 2014 with other ports afterwards
4949180	4956140	um the the fun thing about this is that there is an ms das version uh retro city rampage 486
4957020	4963420	was uh also released in july 29th 2015 it's a limited physical run on a floppy disk
4964140	4971100	as well as a digital download um god floppy disks i remember having descent on 14 three and a
4971100	4981900	quarters um anyway um you are in the city of theft off theftropolis in 1985 and you are the player
4981900	4990460	a thug for hire who um you work for crime syndicate led by the jester and then um you uh
4991980	4997260	during a bad uh bad heist you run into a time traveling telephone booth where we've seen this
4997260	5006060	before bill and ted and the doctor um the booth sends you uh to the the year 20 x dx
5006460	5013580	i i love that um and then the booth breaks down and a guy named doc chuck who is supposed to be
5013580	5020940	like you know dr brown from back to the future um arrives and rescues you and he thinks that
5020940	5026300	you're like some hero when you're just an accidental person oh yeah 20 x d6 that's right
5027100	5034140	um so you go through you know you have uh different types of parodies of people um you
5034140	5038700	you know you have your parody law enforcement the jester bayside high school students
5038700	5047420	and dr von buttnick yes like dr robotnik um and he's the head of rnd at at core
5049100	5051900	and they want to use the time machine to control the electronics market
5052860	5059260	anyway um the game was inspired by grand theft auto and that you uh do a different bunch of
5059260	5068060	missions in a huge open city um and they they planned 50 story missions and 30 challenge levels
5068060	5073980	um and uh like there's like all kinds of different shops and all kinds of different things they have
5073980	5079500	homage to different 8-bit video games um different elements from different genre
5080300	5085900	different graphics filters that can simulate the different uh types of computers and game controls
5085900	5089660	and it is played top down bird's eye like the original gta games
5090780	5097180	um and so and it also can switch um into a 2d perspective like platformer
5098140	5105180	um the game also has free roaming mode that lets you just run around the city and just cause
5105180	5111260	trouble the whole time um you can play it with unlockable characters from other uh indie developed
5111260	5116700	games like super meat boy commander video from the bit trip series and steve from minecraft and
5116700	5124860	others um on february 28th uh the day of the we release the pc update became available allowing
5124860	5131180	you to play the game's prototype called rom city rampage and it is a port of retro city rampage to
5131180	5139340	ness homebrew and emulated within retro city rampage um so pc users got it for free it was
5139340	5144780	included with the wii and 3ds versions and then it was later released on psn and xbox live
5145900	5154460	so conceptually the game came from a homebrew project in 2002 um a game programmer named
5154460	5162140	brian provinciano uh constructed a nes system development kit and was trying to remake grand
5162140	5170540	theft auto 3 with 8-bit uh sprites calling it grand theftendo and then uh he uh showed it off
5170540	5177180	at the 2011 game developers conference showed his methods you know and people were interested in it
5177980	5181660	so new characters added more stuff was doing he ended up working on it full time
5182380	5186940	and the rest is history so some of the games that are referenced in this
5187740	5195340	um are river city ransom uh which is also uh niketsu hot downtown story i always get the
5195340	5200460	name messed up non-super mario brothers legend zelda mega man contra bionic commando metal gear
5200460	5206860	smash tvs uh teenage mutant turtles a bunch of others and then there had cheesy one-liners in
5206860	5217740	there um with cameos by phil fish from fez uh billy campbell and phil guerrero um of ytv fame
5219020	5221340	um and uh
5224460	5227900	of course uh one thing they are quick to say is that even though it's called
5227900	5236460	uh retro city rampage it is not a reference to river city ransom in the name um so
5237340	5244140	there is a limited edition we port of retro city rampages uh sequel shakedown hawaii
5244700	5251420	um that was a europe exclusive limited port and then they said uh they were doing a physical we
5251420	5257660	version of retro city rampage with ref called retro city rampage dx plus that would also be
5257660	5266300	released uh on july 9 2020 and had a limited run of 3 000 copies um just cleaned up and looking
5266300	5273340	better um so it got really good reviews very positive it got a 71 on medicritic
5273900	5281900	um as of march 2013 the game sold 100 000 copies ps3 and pc versions made the most profit
5282700	5290620	um as of december 2014 the developer said that the game had reached 400 000 sold copies
5290620	5299420	and an additional uh 270 000 playstation plus units while also uh stating pc and playstation
5299420	5305980	uh family versions are still the most successful um so like i said there was a um a sequel shakedown
5305980	5312860	hawaii on november 24 2015 it was announced then it was 30 years after retro city rampage

5362220	5362540	rampage
5365340	5374620	it's too close sounding right um but yeah it's it's it's a it's a doozy all right a lot of
5374620	5379740	people in our chat uh kind of thinking oh yeah i remember this or i've played this you know this
5379740	5386780	is kind of a game that i i have played somewhat recently even so it's over 10 years old but yeah
5386780	5396460	the first week of january 2013 okay oh so right at that 10-year mark wow interesting all right
5396460	5401260	there it is a classic game of the week all right let's take some time now to travel around the
5401260	5406460	gaming world quickly and check out some rapid fire news uh from across the gaming globe so
5406460	5413820	loki we'll start with you yeah uh well we'll talk a little bit about game pass and uh playstation
5413820	5421740	plus so game pass is got some new games coming in uh this month so we got persona 3 portable
5421740	5429180	persona 4 golden and monster hunter rise those are coming this month uh leaving game pass uh
5429180	5438140	danganronpa trigger happy havoc nobody saves the world paparazzi uh the anacrusius and we happy
5438140	5443740	few and windjammers 2 and then of course playstation plus those are some pretty big
5443740	5450860	titles to be losing but persona that's a big land too so you know i guess it evens out a little bit
5452220	5459420	yeah uh playstation plus is going to be getting uh looks like devil may cry 5
5459420	5464540	back for blood and also uh let's see what else here
5466060	5476300	um yeah so devil may cry 5 special edition back for blood and we've got a dragon ball fighter z
5477340	5484780	uh erica jet the far shore just cause for reloaded life is strange life is strange before the storm
5484780	5494060	omno sinai wild wild hearts two uh star wars demolition and siphon filter 3 what the heck
5494060	5500220	is star wars demolition anyways filter yes i haven't felt through three those are playstation
5500220	5506060	one games the last three and yeah i was like i haven't heard that game in an age well it's nice
5506060	5510220	to see playstation bumping up their back catalog but i i still feel like that service isn't catching
5510220	5516380	on the same way i have no interest in it yeah i think that at all the drip feeding's too slow
5517020	5528380	open the floodgates all right uh what else and then uh yeah uh let's see i think uh this is
5528380	5534940	pretty funny so they've got a brand new final fantasy 7 mod that adds voice acting to the pc
5534940	5539580	version and so this is the classic final fantasy 7 because obviously the modern ones have voice
5539580	5548700	acting but uh it's called echo s7 i can get it at asuna mods and it basically adds yeah
5549260	5554140	voice acting to all the characters in final fantasy 7 i think there may even be like
5554140	5558060	six basically through the original script but i think it might be some embellishments on some
5558060	5564140	stuff but neat i'd be willing to check it out what's the sound arith makes when she bites it
5565100	5567660	i did not show that in the preview video so i'm not sure
5570700	5572940	that just makes me think of that thing with
5574860	5578860	christopher lee telling someone how someone dies when they're stabbed in the back and not to argue
5578860	5586140	with them uh they're also apparently the the team that put it out um is also working on voice acting
5586140	5593980	mods for final fantasy 8 and 9 as well oh boy all right it's kind of interesting that's interesting
5594860	5604460	all right uh dark sakura so um there's a live action dungeon dragons tv series uh at paramount
5604460	5614620	plus i'm not going to watch it um it is uh they're basically jumping off of the the halo bandwagon
5614620	5621660	even though the halo thing sucked um and uh so it's paramount uh pictures and e1 are partnering
5621660	5628860	to produce the series um they're also the ones behind the movie and uh it's a large scope tv
5628860	5638140	project uh that they're gonna be putting out um they also were um there's another one on here
5638140	5642060	oh yeah um the honor monk thieves also has michelle rodriguez so maybe i'll see it because of
5642060	5646220	because of her um hugh grant's in it i didn't know hugh grant was in it wow
5646220	5654460	anyway um so yeah that that's uh that's planning to come out um i'm gonna i would rather watch
5654460	5660380	willow just saying um s2100 matt in chat going back to the uh voice acting file has the seventh
5660380	5668380	story talking about arith dying says they should swap in the Waluigi way in there well it'd be in
5668380	5673180	a mod you know you probably could get that yeah you can just make the mario died sound
5676620	5681100	all right i'm sure we'll see all sorts of youtubes that have different death noises
5681100	5687820	slight because the ultimate one would be to have um a throwback to remember the dear sister short
5687820	5693980	on saturday night live and when she gets killed have it go what you say when you want
5693980	5701740	uh yeah i'm sure that probably already exists because everybody was doing dear sister
5702540	5710300	parodies back in the day all right anyway uh one more story for you uh for rapid fire news talking
5710300	5717420	about oh the end of a virtual compendium for the sega mega drive bitmap books uh has to cancel
5717420	5723660	their mega drive visual compendium because sega has threatened it legally uh this would have been
5723660	5729180	the eighth release in the bitmap book series there's been atari 2600 Commodore 64 a lot of
5729180	5734540	you linked to me that one it looked pretty cool Amiga NES and SNES these are hefty books they're
5734540	5740540	coffee table books basically with visual material for the platform's archives sprites stages box art
5740540	5746460	marketing materials sega originally backed bitmap books for a sega master system edition
5747020	5752700	but wouldn't do the same thing for the 16-bit version so in a statement to bitmap books fans
5752700	5757100	the creative director sam dyer said we've had to push back the release date a few times and as of
5757100	5762060	now we have not communicated why i'm afraid to say that we've been asked by sega to remove the listing
5762060	5767100	or face potential legal action as a small business this is not something we can risk after discussions
5767100	5772060	their position is non-negotiable it is of course their right to protect their ip as they see fit
5772060	5776540	now of course people in chat talking about you know dart tsu is saying i mean that's the sort
5776540	5782540	of thing i might expect from nintendo but yeah sega not usually the company to do this sort of

5955100	5965340	a call over at vog network.com discord yeah uh so net ease has basically dissolved the team that
5965340	5972620	was maintaining the blizzard games in china um they've been i guess laid off or uh reassigned
5972620	5977980	to different projects and this is ending i guess they were working those for 14 years wow that's a
5977980	5985660	long time um so yeah that's uh there is less than 100 people affected by that but that's
5985660	5990780	you know still a lot of staff that's been reallocated stuff i mean we don't need to
5990780	5996060	maintain blizzard games anymore right you know it's it's fine i'm self-sustaining i'm surprised
5996060	6002940	there wasn't a last minute reprieve on all of that but they sure i mean this is very finalized for
6002940	6011580	all of that isn't it so yeah apparently um the the contract was not renewed by blizzard so maybe
6011580	6017260	they're handling it internally or just saying and whatever you know i don't know but that of course
6017260	6024380	affects overwatch 2 diablo 3 world of warcraft starcraft hearthstone heroes of the storm so
6024380	6032780	so and uh those games will be now unplayable in china sucks if you live in china it sucks for
6032780	6037180	people that invested hours upon hours in those games i can't even imagine something like that
6037180	6043980	happening over here that's for sure all right yeah that sucks so before we get to our next story
6045900	6047420	guess what i found over on youtube
6047420	6050860	all right let me check this out
6057180	6061420	i'm doing this i'm doing this live what to say
6067340	6070700	okay i can't play too much of the song or we're gonna get silenced

6103500	6110460	i'm in a good mood i know i know i actually like her in the the new version because she has a
6110460	6116300	personality yeah i i i like her character in the new version as woman in refrigerator you know
6116300	6121100	what i mean and that's why when they they flip the script and they don't kill her in the next
6121100	6125420	one it's gonna it's gonna hit differently because it's gonna happen they're not gonna kill her
6125420	6134140	west muster has the has a thing like tears in the rain thank you mr replicant um anyway um stadia
6134140	6139100	has one last hurrah but it's not anything new it's new to us but certainly not new to them
6139980	6146780	uh they are releasing the worm game it is a very simple snake-like game that stadia uh
6146780	6153740	that stadia's cloud features were used uh for were tested using this game um and their statement says
6153740	6158540	play the game that came to stadia before stadia came to the world worm game is a humble title
6158540	6163580	we use to test many of stadia's features starting well before our 2019 public launch right through
6163580	6169900	2022 it looks cute i like that i'll say it won't win game of the year but we spent a lot of time
6169900	6175180	playing it we think it's fun here you go thank you i'm looking i'll give it a go i was gonna
6175180	6179900	say there's something you can play on stream on your goodbye stadium okay
6181820	6187740	just saying i actually i might i might i might i might do that like at the end of of wednesday
6187740	6194540	stream maybe we'll see s2100 matt says snake 360 did it better yeah yyr will sue although i guess
6194540	6198540	technically he can't lay claim to the snake concept no guess but i can't say that with
6198540	6205580	a tron machine sitting behind me now can i oh come on i sat on my nokia i know that game's playing
6206860	6210540	what two-bit snake in the bathroom
6213340	6217260	all right i remember when i got a phone in color and i was like bejeweled
6218460	6222620	remember when there were magazines in the bathroom then phone set up my work
6224460	6228380	oh did i remember there was that shirt that came out like when the iphone first came out this is
6229260	6235340	changed the way i go to the bathroom this is interesting marketing way i wish i'd bought
6235340	6239420	that when it came out all right just a few more stories then we'll get to the listener roundtable
6239420	6247580	so loki yeah so there's been an announcement i guess that a new mech warrior game is being
6247580	6255820	worked on by piranha games and it's supposed to be released in 2024 um basically it was teased
6255820	6262300	you know i'll i'll just say that it's not mech warrior online too and it's not a successor to
6262300	6267500	mech warrior online and it's not an online pvp game think of it more like in line with
6267500	6275180	mech warrior 5 but a standalone game a standalone product cool i like mech warrior so we need to see
6275180	6281580	yeah i know dartistry is a big fan too so i'm sure some people will uh be very happy about that so
6281580	6287580	yeah all right and uh lots of people very happy this week with the results of awesome games done
6287580	6293820	quick of course awesome games done quick doing awesome things and they raised 2.6 million dollars
6293820	6299900	when all was said and done for the prevent cancer foundation uh not a bad chunk of change whatsoever
6300460	6308300	folks do feel the need to point out though it is less than the 3.4 million agt agdq 2022 picked up
6308300	6312060	i kind of go there's a couple ways you can kind of address it number one i sort of think you
6312060	6317580	can't keep breaking the ceiling every time number two the economy is in a different place number
6317580	6323180	three the and this is this isn't a secret it's not exactly like advertised greatly but it's not
6323180	6327100	a secret and bobby got into it more on his show tonight because as i'm sure you all know bobby
6327100	6331820	blackwolf uh here at voice geeks network has done some of the announcing for games done quick
6331820	6336940	including this most recent one he goes way more in depth on his show so i'll leave it for that but
6336940	6341340	usually they would take the bits and the subs they'd kind of dump it all into the pot towards
6341340	6348140	the end of the run and do that this time because remember they they canceled the florida in person
6348140	6353740	one because of a multi-tooled reason some of it being their complete lack of covid precautions
6353740	6358460	and like the fact you could not in florida you cannot tell people you must be vaccinated to be
6358460	6365980	here or the event could get sued because we all know florida is run by a interesting individual
6365980	6371740	and i'll leave that at that also uh quite frankly there's a lot of lgbtq individuals that are
6371740	6375340	involved with awesome games done quick not just speedrunners themselves but people affiliated
6375340	6380380	with the organization and there were people that were like if it's in florida i'm not going
6380380	6387660	because i don't feel safe there um so for a multitude of reasons games done quick had to
6387660	6393580	basically pull out of florida so the bits and the subs had to go to the cancellation fees because
6394300	6399340	that's a contract they couldn't get out of unfortunately even though it is charity and
6399340	6404940	the money so awesome game so if you're like upset hearing that because you gave bits or subs or
6404940	6410540	whatever don't be mad at awesome games done quick be mad at florida for keeping them on the hook for
6410540	6417500	that so anyway i'll leave the rest to bobby blackwolf on his show let's go back and focus
6417500	6422380	on the good uh 2.6 million is still a hell of a lot of money that's going to do a lot of good over
6422380	6429100	at the prevent cancer foundation uh and apparently there was one person that donated 100 000 that's
6429100	6434700	a very uh large donation i wonder who the mystery person is uh also a new world record was set in
6434700	6440780	super mario galaxy 2 which is pretty cool uh the event of course was all online and the summer
6440780	6447660	games done quick event has been announced for may 28th little earlier than usual uh perhaps because
6447660	6453020	they've found an in-person location to do it perhaps but we don't know no confirmation yet if
6453020	6459660	it is in person or if it will be virtual once again i have a feeling it'll be in person because
6459660	6463420	i'll tell you again if you go back to bobby's show because he went to summer games done quick last
6463420	6469740	year i'll tell you that was the most covid precautions i've seen at any convention and if
6469740	6476620	they even do a fraction of that for this next year it'll be fine uh and that that event the summer
6476620	6482300	one was never historically in florida it was in minnesota historically assuming they go back there
6483020	6489500	any of those covid guidelines should not be a problem so we'll see what happens all right yeah
6489500	6493180	tiger class says summer games is usually is quite early it's usually around june yeah it's pretty
6493180	6497980	close to my birthday usually so it's pretty pretty early that they're doing this so um but you know
6497980	6503100	hey anytime is a good time to raise money for doctors without borders which is what the summer
6503100	6508540	event goes to so we will keep an eye out and uh best of luck to any of you that are submitting
6508540	6513420	your own speed runs or auditioning to be a host like bobby blackwolf who has to audition every
6513420	6518940	time because no one gets grandfathered into that which i also think is pretty cool that like they
6518940	6524940	don't just have a click that's impenetrable like they make people practice every time basically to
6524940	6532220	get in so all right um that's it for our slotted stories tonight so i want to go to our list of
6532220	6536540	roundtable unfortunately i don't think we have any emails tonight i'll confer with dark soccer
6536540	6544700	though no uh so purchase participate at orange longtrader.com is the place to send an email if
6544700	6550860	you would like to so um by the way ssj100 matt wants to point out speaking of convention
6550860	6557980	protection magfest's early numbers came in and as of thursday they've had 76 positive cases
6557980	6564700	but that's out of 20 000 people so pretty good pretty good compared to the rest of the world
6564700	6571660	so yeah what do you know masks work all right yeah yeah all right um
6573180	6576860	so let me check with uh loki and see if there's any last minute stories
6577980	6583580	um there's a few rumors i guess rumors and speculation if you will so there was
6583580	6587500	a rumor that there's a detachable disk drive coming to the playstation 5
6588540	6596540	i don't know why you would do that but um is that for the all digital one to convert that yes but
6596540	6601580	why like why would you do that i don't know i don't know i don't think there would be a demand
6601580	6607660	for that but i mean it's apparently they're saying that there's test kits in players or
6607660	6614940	people's hands and it works flawlessly okay yeah it's gotta be def says the same thing in chat for
6614940	6619340	the digital version probably it's gotta be but i didn't maybe with the supply issues a lot of
6619340	6624300	people settled for digital that didn't really want to i i don't know i don't know it's hard is there
6624300	6633180	a thing like because like i remember um their drives don't play like certain types of discs
6633180	6639180	maybe like to support playstation 2 disks or something like that i don't know but like it
6639740	6644140	yeah i don't know i don't see a point for it yeah the disk if the disk drives let you play all the
6644140	6649740	old playstation games hell yeah now you're talking but i just don't see that yeah you know it'd be
6649740	6655420	cool it's like a disk drive it has a disk drive and it has like the old playstation memory card
6655420	6661580	slots too and that would be pretty sweet but yeah i don't see that fifth dream says all playstation
6661820	6667260	rumor i hear all playstation 5 soon will be one skew and this drive is to add to that oh
6667900	6673340	is that i i would not like that oh no they're gonna sell it separately back back
6676140	6682380	well i mean to be fair to be fair like digital game sales though it's been really high compared
6682380	6692540	to physical game sales um so i mean i get it i get it but you also you i may not get a playstation
6692540	6698380	5 if i can't find one with a disk drive i'm not buying one like i have all these playstation 4
6698380	6702940	games i would like to be able to play on the 5 as well i have my library you'll be able to get one
6702940	6707820	for like you'll be able to get one i'm sure that they'll have them out there but yeah i could see
6707820	6711820	them doing like a revision maybe they'll do like an even slimmer model or something like that and
6711820	6718220	there's only the all digital version for that or something because they can't make it a slimmer
6718220	6722460	with the disk drive jutting out there i mean as it is with the disk drive in there it looks
6723980	6731020	looks kind of ugly i don't know all right well it looks like we do have at least one caller that
6731020	6735660	would like to call in tonight so let's bring them on the air and this is someone we hear from quite
6735660	6739660	often but it's always a pleasure to hear from them so hello you are on orange launch radio who's this
6740620	6745900	it's one and only ronma how is everybody doing tonight i am doing fantastic rama how are you
6745900	6751820	it's so good to hear from you i'm good i'm going to click this button so i can kind of jump into
6751820	6756620	the chat because i think the last time i clicked a button i got kicked out of the stream so i'm
6756620	6764380	just like let's not make the same mistake like last time okay all right let's so you know what
6764940	6769820	it does the same thing mine does but let's let's just bring them right on back i don't it must be
6769820	6775980	a discord thing my discord does the same thing rama for what it's worth um here we go let's see
6775980	6782540	there we go perfect i'm here one way or another uh let's get the camera on good i just got some
6782540	6789740	new equipment i'm just like i'm not trying to have another encore presentation what is up my friend
6789820	6795900	it's good to see you it's good to see you too uh first things first oh it seems like whenever i
6795900	6802140	call in i somehow bring olr back to the old school back to its roots okay no problem with that we
6802140	6807340	love a good ddr story or whatever it is and i need to let touch up my roots i'm sorry the red looks
6807340	6812780	lovely though i have to say thank you you're welcome so i have mentioned on the show previously
6812780	6819100	i have a friend named matt who has a ddr third mix machine in his house and he's giving it to me
6819100	6827260	wow what no this matt this matt has a dr extreme in his house what are you talking about okay so
6827260	6833100	we have um west coast matt and east coast matt i know like i know like 20 people named matt
6833100	6839500	that's why they all have nicknames that's why this one's low-key so exactly yeah so
6840860	6847020	we have a group chat going and look at east coast matt's like i want to have a party we're talking
6847020	6854700	ddr bimani come over let's have a ddr party so he throws together a ddr party i go in my closet
6854700	6860540	i grab some sweats i grab a shirt so i'm like yeah i'm going to be hurting the next day so
6860540	6867340	we all go to his house and i see the machine being updated now normally it's a third mix machine with
6867340	6874540	a computer running stepmania okay it seems this time one of the people that we hang out with
6875420	6884540	brought a copy of the latest release of ddr was it the omni mix or was it yes uh-huh
6884540	6895180	uh-huh i've seen this too but i can't say where exactly so an hour later after setting it up
6895180	6901100	here we are all playing omni mix and we're going through every single release of ddr
6901100	6907980	and we're just even doing like an infinite event mode loop it's like we're doing three songs that
6907980	6915580	we jump off and three more two more people jump up it was just nuts and i'm like i am going to
6915580	6923420	be hurting in the morning i have not played this much ddr and god knows how long the first time i
6923420	6927660	saw that i spent so much time just going through the song list and listening to all the little
6927660	6933740	clips bringing back memory all the xbox games it was all the xbox games because um the individual
6933740	6938220	that i was looking at this with was not as familiar with the xbox games so we were yeah
6938220	6942460	looking at that so uh by the way there's a 2d x omni mix too if you didn't know
6944460	6947180	you shouldn't tell me things like that i'm just saying because there's a
6947740	6952940	beatmania controller in my closet for the ps2 it's pretty hot it's pretty sexy yeah
6952940	6959900	hey obviously i cannot tell you where or why or how or even i might there's hypothetically
6959900	6965420	there's a 2d x omnium would i say that i say hypothetically there's one i uh rob you're drooling
6968540	6974780	and that's why i post it in the vog discord that picture you know i'm just like y'all gotta see
6974780	6985180	this so so between ddr and the copious amount of adult beverages good time was had all around
6985180	6991660	and i'm just like good lord i feel like i i feel like i'm i'm at a con somewhere we're just
6991660	6996780	sitting around having a good time jumping up on the machine just finding three songs to play and
6996780	7003740	just going for broke brown chan yes you just made my brain do the weirdest crossover ever
7003740	7012540	oh yeah picture it sicily 1912 a young girl finds her first ddr machine at a casino
7016380	7021500	um one did orange right is in chat it reminded me of something important too is that hypothetically
7021500	7026380	if ddr and beatmania 2d x had omni mixes there's probably one for pop and music as well and it's
7026380	7034060	probably installable on a machine hypothetically so the difference is with this is that
7034780	7041500	we were actually running omni mix on a regular pc and since it took us it took some time to get it
7041500	7045980	up and running the way it should be we're all pitching together to upgrade the ddr machine
7045980	7053900	something a little more potent well good times that that sounds like a lot of fun so it was
7053900	7059020	because i'm just sitting there going through all of this and and i'm just like i remembered
7059020	7065660	any this song i remember this is the very first song i did on hard mode and then i find out that
7065660	7074220	there is an underground emus network i i definitely have never heard about that before no i definitely
7074220	7080860	not absolutely what you're talking about that you get in trouble you get in trouble for that konami
7080860	7085660	will sue would never do anything in lee perish the thought sounds like we kind of went along
7085660	7093820	the lines of fight club what's the first rule of fight club it's the very the very same first thing
7093820	7101420	i was told about it yeah see last night was just a lot of fun and i just needed to share this with
7101420	7109180	y'all because no it's it was it was just fun and i'm just like oh i'm going to be hurting in the
7109180	7116380	morning but oddly enough i guess between the adult beverages and so forth i felt pretty good
7116380	7122700	when i got up slept in but i felt pretty good pretty damn good when i got up well that's that's
7122700	7129020	a lot of fun so um i i i would normally say something like um gosh i wish i could have been
7129020	7133100	there to play that too because i bet playing that machine would be a lot of fun um but instead i'm
7133100	7138620	in this place where i'm like i'm glad you got to play it it's a lot of fun well rob i tell you what
7138620	7142860	the next time you come out this way i already came we're going to bring you to the machine
7143820	7149740	well the next time you come out this way i'm gonna introduce you to a friend of mine oh my
7151980	7156540	and it's kind of interesting you said that because with universal studios opening up
7156540	7164940	super nintendo world i'm like the four of us need to go honestly truth there's some they've
7164940	7169260	been doing soft openings and of course it's all over tik somehow that got into my tik tok
7169820	7175340	algorithm so i see all of these people going to super nintendo world in my tik tok but it looks
7175340	7180300	it looks really cool it looks like you could spend like you could spend disney level dollars there
7180300	7185820	but it does look really cool and we need mario hats i need one of those fucking wristbands i
7185820	7191020	want a princess peach wristband are you fucking kidding me and i know you want a luigi one so
7191100	7198140	it's not if not luigi daisy oh they have daisy ones i don't know but i'm just saying you know
7199100	7203580	oh bobby also reminds me the tron ride opens in orlando on april 4th
7204300	7209420	i'm not thrilled about the prospect of going to florida but for tron i always say i'll do almost
7209420	7217340	anything so that um i'm actually potentially looking at maybe extending a trip out there so
7217340	7223100	i can do disney but a lot of it depends on money and things i don't want to talk about on air just
7223100	7227340	because they have to do with money so assuming i have money i would love to make something like
7227340	7232220	that happen keep in mind alan is coming with me to dragon con this year which is pretty exciting
7232220	7238700	so oh he's going to begin for he's going to get lost in the sauce yeah yeah uh finara also says
7238700	7244860	orlando is a bit better than most places in florida oh for sure it's you know it's it's um
7245820	7250460	an island of decency and an ocean of piss sorry to our florida listeners
7252060	7257020	or if you're from new york you you know why you have that reputation each and everybody that
7257020	7263420	lives there know why you have that reputation so i'm sorry but also you understand also but rob
7263420	7269740	it's also said if you're from new york basically it's like the southern half of florida is just
7269740	7275420	a new york wannabe because of all the people moving down there like the upper half
7278460	7282380	bottom half you know i'm walking here come on
7284700	7289260	sorry sj100 matt said something in chat and i had an i forgot moment until he said that
7289260	7295020	in chat and i was like i i absolutely will matt thank you for reminding me that that's
7295980	7303820	a thing anyway um what else was i gonna say i don't know i was gonna thank my friend rama
7303820	7310860	for calling into the show uh anything else you want to uh tell us about uh i went out
7310860	7320220	earlier and bought about 12 cans of imported sparkling water what for well we talked about
7320300	7324620	this on on anime jam session a while back it seems that there's a taiwanese company that
7324620	7332300	put out like themed canned sparkling water cans you can get uh king of fighters street fighter
7332300	7339100	dragon ball z and of course uh sailor moon so i kind of went i had to get ones and i
7339100	7344860	kind of had to get one of each senshi so where can i get that for alan uh super rob
7344860	7348220	man and ranch they don't have any of the sailor moon ones though and they don't have the outer
7348300	7353580	senshi i wonder if i could go to a different market i'm gonna find that because i'm gonna
7353580	7358780	find that for my husband i did find them online for the record okay and if you and i do a joint
7358780	7363980	order we can get some free shipping what about that place over on florin that's not 99 ranch
7363980	7371980	but the other brand i haven't i don't go there and i haven't seen them at um actually they may
7371980	7378300	have them at oto's but oto's always charges more i'll pay for for alan i'd pay it but they're not
7378300	7383340	they're not that expensive like like two bucks a can uh 99 i paid two bucks a can that's not that
7383340	7389100	bad i still have like a couple of them in my fridge that he could have because i don't like
7389100	7394060	sparkling water okay well i just for the novelty of it they'll just sit on this shelf they'll never
7394060	7403100	get drunk all right but they're really tasty though just basically it tastes like a can and
7403100	7407260	a piece of fruit that sat next to the can you know what sparkling water is for mixing with alcohol
7407260	7414940	all right it's it's not even for watering my plants i mean you can't beat that kind of logic
7414940	7420060	just saying all right rom i'm gonna let you go so we wrap up the show but any of the thoughts
7420060	7426700	for us tonight that's it i i just love to just bring to the camaraderie and all the fun stuff

7474460	7478860	biggest thing i'll do now is twitch con i mean and maybe dragon con if i can swing it but dragon
