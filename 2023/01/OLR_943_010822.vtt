Happy New Year, January 8th, Rob, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,

00:29.720 --> 00:35.440
Loki. I slept too long. I slept too long.

00:41.120 --> 00:58.920
It's okay, Jason, we weren't here last week. Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. And we are live once again with episode number 943 of our show.

00:58.920 --> 01:27.000
For January the 8th of 2023. See, Jason just kept waking up every single day hearing that they were doing another vote in the house and thinking it was Groundhog Day all over again. That's what was going on with the intro there. Anyway. Hi, I'm Rob Roberts. And I'm here with you for our first show of our 21st broadcast year from 2002 to 2023. I am Rob Roberts and joining me is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hey, how is your 2023 so far?

01:29.360 --> 01:29.960
Rainy.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.080
Yeah, yeah. We'll talk more about that in a moment. But please say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.080
Hello.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.160
Hi, Loki. How are you?

01:38.720 --> 01:40.240
I'm fine. Tired as usual.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.480
Yeah. Me too.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.440
Well, it's medication now. Well, I mean, it has been medication for a while.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.480
Oh, okay. Well, I hope you are. I hope the medication is helping more than it's-

01:49.480 --> 01:51.480
Oh, yeah, it's it's it's just it makes me tired.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.040
Yeah, I got you.

01:52.840 --> 02:21.920
And hello to our chatters because we do tape live of course every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network. Six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We do tape our show live. We're here every week. We weren't here last week. We were originally planning to be here January 1. But then just kind of a domino effect started happening. I mean, we did a show on December 25 for heaven's sake. So we got we gave you something during the holiday. But yeah, New Year's Day just didn't end up

02:21.920 --> 02:47.200
working out. I had been in a show the night before and then the power went out for quite some time that night. The storms you're hearing about in Sacramento, which, yeah, I mean, like if you go to like USA Today, you're gonna see they have a story about half a million people in Sacramento were without power last night. And I think all three of us were among them at some point or another. So yeah, we're living all that right now. And it's pretty it's pretty pretty gnarly.

02:47.200 --> 03:17.040
I didn't think the storms were that bad. But I can I, you know, I'm also very, very biased about that. Yeah. Um, I, I can, it's it's the kind of of rain that a Californian wouldn't be ready for. Right. And it's even though it's happened before, and they should be ready. It's the whole Well, hopefully, the whole reason why we have the weir is to, you know, redirect the waters so that hopefully downtown doesn't flood. Some folks in chat,

03:17.200 --> 03:43.840
as Joe and her mat says, I heard about bad flooding and sack as well. Yeah, it's it's really sad, but it is the more rural parts of town. The way to the south end and without doxing ourselves live on air. I will just say, Jamie lives on the south end, but not that far south. I live on the north end. And Loki lives like East ish in the middle. So none of us are near that area that's flooding, but not to minimize the horrible stuff

03:43.840 --> 04:10.960
on a hill. So yeah, it's never going to be a problem. They just trees falling. Yeah, that was it. And then last night after the power went out, our trash can fell over. So I had to go out last night, but it wasn't raining, though. It was just super windy. It was kind of creepy because it was like super bright outside, even though there was no electricity anywhere. It was just that like the clouds, you know, and everything kept the light in. But yeah, it was a little creepy. But

04:10.960 --> 04:40.920
flooding, it's been more towards like the rivers and stuff. And like some of these creaks have swelled quite a bit where it's like gone over the road and everything. Yeah. So and unfortunately, that rural south area is very likely to flood again tonight. So So our show should stay on air through tonight, because the next part of the bomb cyclone or whatever you want to call I'm sorry, we're talking about personal stuff. But it does it does kind of impact the show because like I would say last week in part impact show. Yeah, last week in part, I really wasn't feeling it.

04:40.960 --> 05:03.960
Because the night before had been really rough for the storm. Loki had a personal engagement. Dark Soccer and I were both just kind of like, man, at that point. So we're just like, let's just we earned a week off. So we took the week off. I'm sure nobody's it was like, let's call the whole thing. Yeah, pretty much. I'm sure nobody's, you know, upset or anything. But it's just one of those. That's how it happened. So now we're here tonight. But yeah, I had had my procedure before that.

05:03.960 --> 05:10.040
I that's right. And I was I was a little like, Oh, you sure you want to do the show? Like, yeah, so

05:11.440 --> 05:21.060
yeah, on the 25th. I had started preparing for it, which was fine. But then I don't know, I was just like, I don't want to I don't want to exist.

05:21.080 --> 05:33.840
Well, and then that's the other thing. So So keep in mind, last week, we didn't do a show because it was storming. And then it stormed again in the middle of the week. And then it stormed again last night. And now it's gonna storm again tonight. Like that's that's the problem we're having right now is

05:33.840 --> 05:46.360
that we're not, you know, and again, to toss it back to a comment Dark Soccer said earlier about how we're not used to it. We're also because we're not used to it. We're not built for it. That's, that's, that's the huge problem is that, you know, although they they have taken many

05:46.360 --> 05:59.840
precautions and in parts of town that are prone to flooding, like I was talking about with the weir earlier and stuff to redirect the the water to the causeway and stuff. You know, it's just, it's, it's, it's a lot. It's a lot of rain back to back to back.

06:00.480 --> 06:29.660
I remember moving out here and seeing all these buildings like are made of plywood is their base. I'm like, where's your rebar? Where's the you know, where are your your concrete bases where you know, and I was just like, man, if if the weather even sneezes, this place is gonna fall over. I wouldn't go out on the balcony of the apartment building

06:29.660 --> 06:33.340
because it was made of wood. Yeah. But I mean, when I first moved out here,

06:33.380 --> 06:47.100
but at the same time, if an Earth if a major earthquake happened in the middle of Boston, a major earthquake, none of my having a middle Boston, the city would topple over and I hope it never does. I'm not you know, but I'm just saying the architecture is different. You're prepared for different climate sorts of things.

06:47.100 --> 07:02.340
Exactly. It's the same thing that people like, Oh, Alabama gets hurricanes. Why don't you people move? I'm like, Los Angeles gets earthquakes. Why don't you people move? It's something it's Northern California gets set on fire regularly. Why don't you move?

07:02.340 --> 07:12.260
The only town that's perfect 100% of the time is San Diego. I swear it's like nothing ever seems to happen in San Diego. That's the only place in America.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.220
They've had some shakes.

07:13.220 --> 07:17.180
Yeah, I guess I guess. But literally, they probably have the best track record.

07:17.220 --> 07:24.060
Yeah. And they also have extraordinary desserts. So I think that, yeah, I think that that makes them extra special.

07:24.060 --> 07:53.940
Yeah. And I see other folks lighting up in chat, of course, like Tiger Claw saying Florida gets hurricanes. Oh, yeah, they do. Pop Culture says we get tornadoes. Yeah. So keep in mind, you know, we were gusting 70 miles an hour. And for you hurricane pros, that's nothing. I know. But again, for us, that's how to start. I'm not I kid you not. One of the one of the neighbors solar panels was on the ground today. That's what kind of wind it was last night. And you know how well everything's built for that. So it's just pretty

07:53.980 --> 07:56.580
wild. Pretty wild. Anyway, go ahead.

07:56.860 --> 08:08.580
It's actually literally to go back to your point, though. I mean, it is a matter of of what you're used to in what the area that you're in is going to be prepared to accommodate, you know. So

08:09.580 --> 08:21.780
that's right. And and very, very good point from Bobby Black Wolf. We're used to it, but it doesn't make it any less scary. Oh, God, like those noises I was hearing last night. I was like, Did my roof just blow off? Because it sounds like my roof just blow off. And of course, I walked outside of my okay, it's fine.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.700
Now, for me, though, those sounds were comforting.

08:27.260 --> 08:42.900
Because I know, I would always have my best sleep during a heavy storm. And at my old house that I grew up in, we had a metal awning that was right outside of my

08:42.900 --> 08:51.780
my, my bedroom. And so wind and rain would hit it and it would, you know, and it would actually put me to sleep.

08:51.780 --> 09:09.540
Yeah, actually, our old old house that I grew up in, in the older part of Roseville, where I grew up for those that know the area, we had like a patio that was built attached to the house. So like we had a smaller backyard because my parents had an outdoor or like an indoor patio built and added to the house. But the

09:09.620 --> 09:26.980
what when the water would hit that during the rainstorm, because the material was made out of it would make a lot of noise. And it was it was actually pretty comforting until that house actually flooded one year. And that's why some of the stuff gives me a little PTSD. It didn't get past the garage, but it got real close. And like all of our neighbors were affected.

09:26.980 --> 09:49.140
I do have to say I have a very vivid memory of being four years old during Hurricane Frederick, which was a cat for hurricane. And me keeping trying to go out and watch the windows and seeing an eight really old oak tree up route in front of my house. Thus, this oak tree was probably as wide around as a minivans on its side.

09:49.620 --> 10:18.740
And that's like if you drive through downtown Midtown, Sacramento right now, that's like every other corner. It's it's unreal. So and it just the only thing that sucks is it would be one thing if it's like, well, we got a week of sunlight to clean up Nope, another three inches of rain tomorrow. And I know there's pictures everywhere out there. Again, I'm sorry to make this about the weather. But again, this is what we're dealing with. I'll get to games in a minute. You see a lot of pictures of the weather out there or the the bridge. I think that the the

10:18.740 --> 10:48.300
Tower Bridge, you see a lot of that in the waters running really high, right? Like right next to Old Town, Sacramento. And like people are like, and I see things on Tick Tock where people are like Sacramento's fucked. Look at how high that river is. And there's another three inches rain coming. But the good quote unquote news is what they're neglecting is that there's a whole bypass system that's built that they haven't even activated yet. But it's getting close. So what happens is that they they open this thing called the weir and it diverts the Sacramento River into the Yolo Causeway, which is a rural land

10:48.300 --> 11:05.420
between Sacramento and Davis, California, where the university is you've probably heard of. And it just it floods that whole area, but it's all rice land and stuff that can resist flooding. So I don't know why they don't open it up sooner. But that's the quote unquote good news is so that my house doesn't flood. That thing exists.

11:05.620 --> 11:09.260
I'll tell you what area I'm worried about. Israel, Linda.

11:10.060 --> 11:16.820
Yeah, well, yeah, that's the place that flooded in the 90s. For sure. And then the same the same area that flooded on New Year's Eve.

11:17.060 --> 11:30.940
The construction over in this area will in the area outside of that basically created a floodplain where there wasn't one. So more human involvement changing ecosystems.

11:31.020 --> 11:59.860
Oh, boy. All right. Well, speaking of the future, I'm actually surprised no one has pointed this out yet. But maybe because I've done a personal stream and some folks maybe saw this hanging out and I was just on Bobby show and we were talking about it. But let me mention here on on Orange Launch Radio, especially for the podcast listeners. Behind me as we tape live tonight, I now not only have a Burger Time arcade one up machine, but I now have a bigger brother, a Tron arcade machine is next to it.

12:00.100 --> 12:19.140
And that was what I built. Pretty much right. I think it was just about ready to go. Oh, no, I was building that instead of doing OLR on New Year's Day. Like, while I was listening to Bobby, I was actually building the machine. So I was working on that most of the most of the night on Sunday. So but you see, it's all set up now.

12:19.940 --> 12:48.860
I do really enjoy the machine. Long story short, it I did not realize that is and you could actually probably see it right towards the top of the marquee is this is actually a black light in the machine. And I realized it actually replicated that I thought because the way other time I've seen this machine was a Bobby's house, and he has external black lights. So I thought that's why I was seeing the black light effect, but the machine actually hasn't built into it, which I thought was pretty cool. And that's why everything inside it kind of glows a little more than maybe what you're used to.

12:48.860 --> 13:18.460
But it's a really cool effect. It's a really nice presenting machine. I mean, if as long as you can get over the fact there's only two games in it, but Tron is great. Disks of Tron, I'd maybe played one other time. And so getting to play that a lot more has been pretty cool. So yeah, so long story short, I am enjoying the machine. And that's why you see that behind me now on the feed. And that was my Christmas present from Alan, who got it half off on a Black Friday sale. That's kind of why it was like, because you know, the machine was really

13:18.460 --> 13:47.940
expensive when it first came out, but half off. That's pretty good deal. So Bobby says I need your arcade one up username so I can add you. Sure. It's just Rob Roberts. I'll one word, Rob Roberts. If you do add me, make sure I have your username, of course, Bobby Black Wolf, but any other folks out there who happen to have a Tron cabinet, I'm happy to add you to the gallery here. Because this is the newer, BurgerTime doesn't do this. BurgerTime was right at the tail end before these machines started getting online on the internet, and now they have online leaderboards.

13:48.140 --> 14:17.460
But that is literally the only thing this thing does is online leaderboards. It does it. It's not like multiplayer online or anything else. It's just the leaderboards. I believe like there's a Mortal Kombat release that they put out not long ago rerelease that you can play it online. I hear it doesn't run very well. But that's I haven't experienced it firsthand. I don't know. But yeah, you can do online leaderboards. But basically what you're doing is you're creating a filter saying I want to see these people.

14:17.660 --> 14:46.740
And it'll filter for those people. Bobby Black Wolf says NBA Jam was the first online one. Well, then that's, that's not too surprising. It went to Mortal Kombat as well, because those were all Midway games back in the day. And I think Warner has licensed all that now. So they're probably, you know, they the arcade one up has put out a lot of Namco, a lot of Capcom and a lot of Warner at this point. So, but it's cool that they got this Disney one. So you know, looking forward to see what else they do. You know, they did they did get The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle, they have old Konami games.

14:46.740 --> 15:16.700
There's a lot of people, myself included, that would love to see a Konami classic classic Konami classic cab with stuff like time pilot, gyrus, Contra, heck haunted castle, if we could go there, although that that game is hard as fuck a haunted castle, of course became Castlevania if you didn't already know, but the original haunted cancel cap. Why can't I talk to me? The original haunted castle is fucking hard. It is it is disgustingly difficult game, but I would love to see like

15:16.700 --> 15:46.660
a, oh, Dr. Seuss says they did Frogger. I didn't even realize that. But yeah, I would love to see the Frogger. Of course they did Frogger. But like a time pilot and gyrus and all that would be great. Bobby says last week, one of my AMA questions was what would your ultimate arcade one up be? And I actually said they should make a home beat mania machine, put sound vortex on it, whatever. I would love to see that too. But unfortunately, they're not going to do it. It'll tell you why they're going to be competing against themselves with 2DX Infinitas and some of the online offerings they're doing so they're not going to want to do that.

15:46.700 --> 16:05.780
But yes, dreamboat answers, of course, build the online version into that cabinet to play it and then people would pay their subscription. Nobody is smart enough to think of that Loki. Let me give you the ideas Konami since you don't have them yourself. Also, I think there was a cabinet with time pilot pilot in it. I bet it was the Frogger cabinet.

16:05.780 --> 16:35.740
And maybe I need to take a second look at that cabinet. I probably just laughed it off because it was Frogger. But I love Tom pilot. It has gyrus too. I mean, let me check. But I would I would love a DDR replica cab. I mean, I don't I they could make assault, they could make it a solo machine. They could literally sell like a solo machine as an arcade one up type of thing. But anyway, that's a discussion for another day. Let's get into our official kickoff topic tonight. I know we've been talking literally about the weather and that sort of thing. But let's get into it.

16:35.780 --> 16:58.820
But I do want to get into some other topics, including since we didn't end up doing a show on New Year's Day, we haven't had an opportunity to look back at the best of 2022. And look forward to our official predictions for 2023. Which, admittedly, we've been slacking on the predictions a little bit ever since we went virtual and the pandemic and all that stuff. We're going to bring them back this year and actually do some predictions.

16:58.820 --> 17:13.900
So looking back on to 2022, I want to kind of go around and see, what were your favorite games of the year? And maybe any additional highlights you want to share with the crowd? Loki, I'll pick on you first.

17:13.900 --> 17:36.900
My favorite games of the year, I didn't play a whole lot, obviously. So really, my highlights probably going to be Goat Simulator 3. I think that was a great sequel. It's still rode that balance of really broken and yet polished. A lot more polished than it was before. And I still need to go back and play it somewhere because they have been doing regular updates to it.

17:36.900 --> 17:51.900
So it's really going to hit its stride once it hits Steam because it's one of those Epic Store exclusives. And that'll be when all the modding support comes in. I'll buy it again, of course. The other game, of course, that's been fun to play this year is Power Washing Sim.

17:51.900 --> 18:06.900
So Power Washing Simulator is just really fun and relaxing to play through. And I'm glad that they keep adding stuff to it as well. And of course, Minecraft. But you know, you've heard me talk to death about Minecraft. What can I really say?

18:06.900 --> 18:08.900
It's still going and that's worth noting.

18:36.900 --> 18:48.900
And it's like, okay, what is it, though? Well, you know, it's, it's, it's about creativity and making the world your own and telling stories. And like, that's what that's what Minecraft is already.

18:48.900 --> 19:18.900
Well, we can't want to make a roblox. Like, what are they? Well, no, I mean, they don't want to make a roblox. I think they're going to try to like, stuff that you can build more lore into or something like that, things you can interpret. It's a bunch of excuses that they don't want to just share what they're doing. Because if they don't get it done, people get upset with like the 4k graphics pack. Well, well, yeah, that too. But no, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're

19:18.900 --> 19:48.900
they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're,

19:48.900 --> 19:51.580
and you're like, oh, wild, all done.

19:51.580 --> 19:55.020
It's like, but that's the only one by him.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.100
He said you were going back in

19:56.100 --> 19:58.580
and like revitalizing all of them

19:58.580 --> 20:01.580
and making them feel more lively and you didn't do that.

20:01.580 --> 20:04.060
So obviously people were disappointed,

20:04.060 --> 20:06.940
but they're like, no, no, no, we never promised anything.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.540
We just showed you concept art.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.440
And then now they're like, well,

20:09.440 --> 20:10.600
we can't show you concept art

20:10.600 --> 20:12.060
because then you're going to think it's coming.

20:12.060 --> 20:13.720
It's like little babies,

20:13.720 --> 20:15.920
like their marketing team is just awful

20:15.920 --> 20:18.420
when it comes to just communicating stuff.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.460
And now they just don't, they just have shut down

20:20.460 --> 20:22.540
and we're just not going to tell you anything then

20:22.540 --> 20:24.180
because then you're just going to get your hopes up.

20:24.180 --> 20:27.320
It sounds like, I don't know.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.220
It sounds like a bad parent, actually.

20:30.220 --> 20:32.740
Like I can see, like if you're a bad parent

20:32.740 --> 20:34.360
trying to like, well, I'm fine, Billy.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.500
I'm not going to promise you anything

20:35.500 --> 20:37.740
because then I'll just disappoint you.

20:37.740 --> 20:41.020
So I don't know.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.400
That wouldn't be the first time I've heard that excuse.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.160
It's just like, it's stupid is what it is.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.920
So now we have like no idea when the update's coming,

20:48.920 --> 20:50.020
what the update is.

20:50.020 --> 20:52.400
It's like, they're not showing anything, which is fine.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.460
Like you can do that.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.920
Like when they did another update,

20:54.920 --> 20:58.280
which is probably the best one that they've done,

20:58.280 --> 21:00.120
it was like in 2020.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.760
And what they did with that is like, they just said,

21:03.760 --> 21:06.080
okay, all of a sudden, boom, here's everything.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.320
And everyone's like, whoa, this is really cool.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.520
And yeah, you know what?

21:09.520 --> 21:12.280
There were things that they showed off in that probably

21:12.280 --> 21:14.880
that were implemented in the game.

21:14.880 --> 21:15.980
And that's fine.

21:16.740 --> 21:17.580
People understand.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.860
But if you just like say,

21:18.860 --> 21:20.700
if you promise like all this stuff

21:20.700 --> 21:23.620
and then give you something that's like 10% of that,

21:23.620 --> 21:24.980
plus something that was like,

21:24.980 --> 21:27.220
should have been in there updates ago,

21:27.220 --> 21:29.580
because that's what you promised.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.500
YYR puts it perfectly in chat who says,

21:32.500 --> 21:35.060
never ever promise the kids the broccoli farm,

21:35.060 --> 21:38.260
unless you're certain you can deliver the broccoli farm.

21:38.260 --> 21:39.660
Exactly, exactly.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.900
Like it's just, and it's fine.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.820
Like people are reasonable and they'll understand.

21:44.860 --> 21:46.660
I mean, some people are unreasonable,

21:46.660 --> 21:49.740
but like the majority of people are reasonable enough

21:49.740 --> 21:52.120
to know that like, okay, I get it.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.700
Like you couldn't, there's the pandemic.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.300
Yes, I understand that there was the pandemic

21:57.300 --> 21:58.140
and all that stuff.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.580
And this update that you're talking about was really big.

22:01.580 --> 22:04.800
And so you couldn't get it done in the timeframe

22:04.800 --> 22:07.060
that you wanted, because it was a lot more complex

22:07.060 --> 22:09.860
than you initially thought, which is also once again,

22:09.860 --> 22:12.980
a stupid idea to promise something that quick a turnaround

22:12.980 --> 22:15.340
when you don't even know the scope of it yet.

22:17.180 --> 22:20.580
So then like, that's understandable.

22:20.580 --> 22:24.700
But that was two years, now three years ago, okay.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.340
Pandemic's been over for a while.

22:26.340 --> 22:27.820
People have gone back to work.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.100
It's not.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.700
I understand it, but like they are now,

22:32.700 --> 22:33.620
they can't use the excuse,

22:33.620 --> 22:35.280
well, we're just not used to working remote.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.820
Okay, it's been three years that you've been working remote.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.100
You're used to it now.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.140
Okay, so I don't wanna hear excuses about like,

22:42.180 --> 22:45.420
oh, well, it's the pandemic is why we couldn't do it.

22:45.420 --> 22:47.080
No, it's because your poor planning

22:47.080 --> 22:48.000
is why you couldn't do it.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.840
And that's fine.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.980
Lower your scope down,

22:49.980 --> 22:53.060
make it clear and understandable what's coming.

22:53.060 --> 22:55.460
Perhaps don't start a third game.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.300
There you go.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.300
Like they're making Minecraft Legends right now,

22:58.300 --> 23:00.340
which is another game that like,

23:00.340 --> 23:03.100
the more I see of it, the less interested in it I am.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.820
They have Minecraft Legends, Dungeons, and now this.

23:07.340 --> 23:10.380
It's just, if your resources are spread so thin,

23:10.380 --> 23:12.900
then don't do that.

23:12.900 --> 23:14.980
Lower your scope down.

23:14.980 --> 23:16.100
Whatever, we'll just,

23:16.100 --> 23:18.200
we just have to wait for them to tell us what it is.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.700
I'm sure in the summer or something will come out.

23:21.660 --> 23:23.060
Yay.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.680
All right.

23:24.680 --> 23:27.220
Dark Sakura, looking back on 2022,

23:27.220 --> 23:28.980
what were some highlights for you?

23:30.540 --> 23:31.700
Dead by Daylight?

23:33.060 --> 23:34.400
Cause it had new chapters.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.020
Except I hate Wesker and I hate the night.

23:39.020 --> 23:42.460
Now for new games, I actually played,

23:42.460 --> 23:44.180
I played all the way through Cult of the Lamb,

23:44.180 --> 23:46.100
which I had such a fun time playing.

23:46.100 --> 23:49.420
That game is messed up and so fun and cute.

23:49.420 --> 23:52.380
And also I started playing Marvel Midnight Suns.

23:52.380 --> 23:57.260
I played on my Monday stream and I really liked that game.

23:57.260 --> 24:02.260
I can't wait until we get more people into the group

24:02.920 --> 24:06.180
and they do some really good stuff about the group dynamics

24:06.180 --> 24:07.540
for the people that were already there

24:07.980 --> 24:09.220
versus the Avengers joining up.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.500
And now I have Spider-Man in there

24:11.500 --> 24:12.900
and he's absolutely perfect.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.880
And I'm having a really good time with the game.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.140
Good.

24:19.140 --> 24:22.180
Yeah, that's all I have to say about that.

24:22.180 --> 24:27.180
I mean, I haven't really had many other things come out

24:28.220 --> 24:31.040
that super interested me, you know,

24:31.040 --> 24:33.140
but those two were the big ones.

24:34.220 --> 24:36.100
Quest Buster in chat says, yay, Midnight Suns.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.060
I finally finished my campaign a few days ago.

24:38.060 --> 24:38.940
So good.

24:38.940 --> 24:40.040
You know, in the Marvel department,

24:40.040 --> 24:43.460
I hear a lot of people really hyping up Marvel Snap.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.300
Is that what it's called?

24:44.300 --> 24:45.140
Yeah, there's people who are into it.

24:45.140 --> 24:46.740
It's not my kind of thing.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.300
Gotcha, I just see a lot of people on,

24:48.300 --> 24:49.980
especially Mastodon where I'm at now

24:49.980 --> 24:52.220
has got a few people I follow in there

24:52.220 --> 24:54.400
that are super into Marvel Snap and hyping that up.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.200
So it's like the Marvel license is thriving

24:57.200 --> 24:58.080
in gaming right now.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.180
That's certainly something to take away from 2022.

25:00.180 --> 25:01.880
That's for sure.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.600
Okay, so let's talk about my game of the year.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.660
So I'm gonna pick something.

25:06.180 --> 25:09.060
I actually don't think this one is too like outside the box

25:09.060 --> 25:11.140
or too like against the grain,

25:11.140 --> 25:13.540
but this is what I consider the game of the year to be.

25:13.540 --> 25:15.540
And I know a lot of people, you know,

25:15.540 --> 25:17.660
think it's God of War, Ragnarok, which is fine,

25:17.660 --> 25:19.460
which is, or Elden Ring, which is fine.

25:19.460 --> 25:21.320
Admittedly, I haven't really sat down

25:21.320 --> 25:23.060
and spent a lot of time with either of those games

25:23.060 --> 25:26.340
in part because I still don't have a PlayStation 5,

25:26.340 --> 25:28.380
although it sounds like maybe I can finally get one soon.

25:28.380 --> 25:29.820
We'll see.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.920
But just also in part that, again,

25:32.920 --> 25:35.460
the genre that Elden Ring is located in

25:36.220 --> 25:38.320
has not yet still convinced me to join it.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.400
And maybe that's, you know, my own hardheadedness.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.540
I don't know.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.140
But I actually would make an argument

25:43.140 --> 25:45.020
that there was another game that came out

25:45.020 --> 25:48.280
that I actually think did something so well,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.700
it supersedes both those games in my,

25:50.700 --> 25:53.940
I could tell you, I could play both of those games

25:53.940 --> 25:55.300
thinking, just going into them,

25:55.300 --> 25:56.740
knowing they're probably 10 out of 10 games.

25:56.740 --> 25:59.220
And there's still another game I would probably say

25:59.220 --> 26:02.380
would truly represent the game of the year.

26:02.380 --> 26:07.380
And some people are probably gonna say I'm incorrect

26:07.940 --> 26:10.260
because this game technically launched

26:10.260 --> 26:12.820
in like December of 2021,

26:12.820 --> 26:14.340
but it didn't launch launch

26:14.340 --> 26:16.140
until the middle of the year this year,

26:16.140 --> 26:17.780
or more a little late in the year.

26:17.780 --> 26:20.940
So I think most people probably discovered it this year.

26:20.940 --> 26:23.500
And I think some of you probably are figuring it out.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.020
And I will say, I think the game of the year

26:26.020 --> 26:30.020
is the bargain basement, appropriately priced,

26:30.020 --> 26:35.020
way underpriced game that provides so many hours of value

26:35.340 --> 26:39.820
that created a whole new genre.

26:39.820 --> 26:41.820
And that game is Vampire Survivors.

26:41.820 --> 26:44.420
I think that is the best game in 2022.

26:44.420 --> 26:46.340
I wouldn't say that's a new genre.

26:46.340 --> 26:47.940
Oh, oh, the Survivor genre.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.500
Look at all of the knockoffs.

26:49.500 --> 26:54.320
I mean, I get that it's rooted in a roguelike.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.940
So that's probably where your feelings come from.

26:57.940 --> 26:58.780
I'm gathering some-

26:59.260 --> 27:00.900
Stuff like Smash TV.

27:02.380 --> 27:06.460
Yeah, but Smash TV and the way the power-ups branched

27:06.460 --> 27:08.020
and the way you work through the game.

27:08.020 --> 27:12.380
I mean, I think what it did very well

27:12.380 --> 27:16.180
is it merged all these concepts together.

27:16.180 --> 27:18.940
It's kind of like it created something new

27:18.940 --> 27:21.660
by taking the very best from all these other tapestries.

27:21.660 --> 27:24.940
And not only did it do it, like it did it so,

27:25.780 --> 27:27.020
like it's a small,

27:27.020 --> 27:29.420
it's only one or two people that made that game,

27:29.420 --> 27:31.140
super duper on the cheap.

27:31.140 --> 27:35.700
And look at the news about how they pretty much

27:35.700 --> 27:39.380
were forced their hand to put that on mobile devices

27:39.380 --> 27:42.180
because everybody started ripping it off.

27:42.180 --> 27:45.940
And even now I start to see all these ads on TikTok

27:45.940 --> 27:47.780
or whatever I'm watching that are basically

27:47.780 --> 27:49.940
rip the Survivor something.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.660
Survivor this, Survivor that.

27:51.660 --> 27:53.620
And we're not talking about the TV show.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.660
We're not talking about a Destiny's Child song.

27:55.700 --> 27:56.860
We're talking about this trend

27:56.860 --> 27:58.420
that Vampire Survivor started.

27:59.820 --> 28:01.940
And now we have games like Soul Stone Survivors

28:01.940 --> 28:03.580
that I think are also very good

28:03.580 --> 28:07.140
that kind of take that idea of the progression

28:07.140 --> 28:09.060
and the randomness of a roguelike

28:09.060 --> 28:11.140
with the action of a Smash TV

28:11.140 --> 28:13.820
or a twin stick shooter, basically.

28:13.820 --> 28:16.620
Because some might say that like Returnal

28:16.620 --> 28:18.220
also does this very well.

28:18.220 --> 28:20.700
But I think Vampire Survivors,

28:20.700 --> 28:22.620
especially when you consider how much it costs

28:22.700 --> 28:25.660
and how prolific it got is why I would say

28:25.660 --> 28:27.220
that was probably the best game of the year.

28:27.220 --> 28:29.060
In my opinion, it's my opinion.

28:29.060 --> 28:33.020
So looking in chat, Dartusia says,

28:33.020 --> 28:35.500
oh yeah, Vampire Survivors is at least top three.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.660
I just bought Super Smash TV on Super Nintendo.

28:38.660 --> 28:42.420
Michi said she remembered playing it, so it's coming.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.380
In 5th Dreamer Greaves, Vampire Survivors is amazing.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.780
Dartusia also saying, I don't blame you on Dark Souls.

28:47.780 --> 28:49.980
I tried it, I couldn't get past the first mid-boss,

28:49.980 --> 28:51.500
so I swore off soul stuff.

28:51.540 --> 28:54.860
See, meanwhile, Alan, my other half,

28:54.860 --> 28:56.860
loves those soul games.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.820
So that's like his jam.

28:58.820 --> 29:02.460
Yeah, and more power to him.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.780
I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum.

29:04.780 --> 29:06.700
That's my favorite game of the year, personally.

29:06.700 --> 29:07.540
You can't change that.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.800
So this is what it is.

29:09.900 --> 29:11.580
S2100Matt says, I get what Rob is saying.

29:11.580 --> 29:12.700
It's how it's implemented.

29:12.700 --> 29:13.860
The core idea is not new,

29:13.860 --> 29:15.660
but the implementation in this creative way

29:15.660 --> 29:16.860
is kind of revolutionary.

29:16.860 --> 29:19.580
Yeah, yeah, I think that's another good way of saying it.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.460
So there you go.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.540
That's my hot take on what probably

29:24.540 --> 29:25.980
the best game of the year was.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.540
As far as like, well, let's talk about now,

29:29.540 --> 29:32.620
looking forward, like 2023, what do we think?

29:33.620 --> 29:36.100
Let's make some off-the-wall predictions.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.780
So I'll just say, let's do like three predictions.

29:38.780 --> 29:39.820
We'll go around and each,

29:39.820 --> 29:41.140
I think that's the way we used to do it.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.060
We'll each go around and give a prediction,

29:43.060 --> 29:45.860
and I will put it into a PowerPoint presentation,

29:45.860 --> 29:49.620
since I don't have a jar that we can look at

29:49.620 --> 29:52.740
at the end of the year and see what came true

29:52.740 --> 29:53.620
and what didn't.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.880
I would invite those of you in chat

29:55.880 --> 29:59.060
over at twitch.tv slash vog network

29:59.060 --> 30:00.860
to give your suggestions,

30:00.860 --> 30:02.380
because if we can't think of something,

30:02.380 --> 30:03.680
we might pull from our chat room

30:03.680 --> 30:06.500
over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.340
So-

30:07.340 --> 30:09.220
We could do a variant of it.

30:09.220 --> 30:10.060
What's that?

30:10.060 --> 30:12.500
The 2023 wishlist.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.220
You wanna do a wishlist?

30:14.220 --> 30:15.220
Yeah, why not?

30:15.420 --> 30:17.700
Because some of my predictions have to do with things

30:17.700 --> 30:19.380
that I don't think are gonna land well.

30:19.380 --> 30:21.240
And it's not that I wish it on that,

30:21.240 --> 30:25.920
but I'll tell you what my wishlist items are, but yeah.

30:27.580 --> 30:30.620
One of them has to do with something not doing well.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.220
So I wanna leave it, in fact, actually,

30:33.220 --> 30:35.820
I think two of mine are perhaps construed negative.

30:35.820 --> 30:38.160
I think one of them would actually ultimately be positive,

30:38.160 --> 30:39.260
but we'll get to that.

30:40.620 --> 30:43.060
So let's go around the table.

30:43.060 --> 30:45.940
Loki, what's a prediction you have for 2023?

30:46.980 --> 30:48.800
2023, hmm.

30:51.620 --> 30:55.300
I think that, well, we're getting into a story

30:55.300 --> 30:58.340
about something that's not gonna be short-handed

30:58.340 --> 31:01.860
anytime soon, or apparently this year,

31:01.860 --> 31:04.780
it's supposed to be readily available,

31:04.780 --> 31:06.500
but that's only because the other thing

31:06.500 --> 31:09.660
that's coming out this year, the PlayStation VR 2,

31:09.660 --> 31:13.780
is gonna be impossible to find and scalp to death.

31:14.860 --> 31:18.060
And there'll be shortages for that all year round.

31:18.060 --> 31:20.100
So PSVR 2 impossible to find,

31:20.100 --> 31:21.940
probably the safest bet you could take

31:21.940 --> 31:23.500
when it comes to predictions.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.340
Yeah.

31:25.340 --> 31:27.380
I'm gonna go ahead and follow that, Jamie.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.700
I hope you don't mind if I go out of order,

31:28.700 --> 31:30.180
but that's because my next one

31:30.180 --> 31:32.700
also has to do with the PSVR 2.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.260
And I'm gonna be as bold to say,

31:34.260 --> 31:36.980
I think the PSVR 2 is a flop.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.820
I think the PSVR 2 does not move

31:38.860 --> 31:40.900
the same type of numbers as the first one.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.540
And I think there's multiple factors

31:42.540 --> 31:44.260
that come into play this time.

31:44.260 --> 31:47.340
I think number one, I don't think there's a launch title

31:47.340 --> 31:49.100
that's gonna entice people.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.620
I'm not saying they're bad.

31:50.620 --> 31:53.100
I understand many of you have very passionate feelings

31:53.100 --> 31:55.700
about the Dark Pictures anthology shooter,

31:55.700 --> 31:56.540
and rightfully so.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.300
I'm not paying $1,000 though for that.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.420
That's the thing, it's like that console,

32:01.420 --> 32:05.320
I had to get a PlayStation 5, which is like $500,

32:05.320 --> 32:08.960
a PlayStation VR 2, which is $550.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.120
I'm sorry, it's a great game.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.120
I really wanna play it, not paying $1,000 to play it.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.880
I actually think this is where some of the competitors

32:17.880 --> 32:21.320
such as, you know, I'm not supposed to call it Oculus Rift,

32:21.320 --> 32:22.160
but I'm going to,

32:22.160 --> 32:24.480
because I still hate the name meta for the company,

32:24.480 --> 32:28.600
but the Oculus Rift and some of the standalone VR devices,

32:28.600 --> 32:31.240
I actually think they have a bit of an advantage here.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.860
This wasn't the case the first time around

32:33.860 --> 32:37.380
with the PlayStation VR, and I just think as well,

32:37.380 --> 32:40.080
it also comes into those supply and demand issues.

32:40.080 --> 32:43.180
I think there's gonna be a little bit of both.

32:43.180 --> 32:46.140
I think it's that it's gonna be impossible to find.

32:46.140 --> 32:47.700
They are not able to make a lot of them,

32:47.700 --> 32:49.940
but I think at the same time, I think come the holidays,

32:49.940 --> 32:51.740
they're not gonna move as many of them as they'd hoped to.

32:51.740 --> 32:53.820
I think it's just gonna flop.

32:53.820 --> 32:56.260
And I'm sorry, again, I don't mean to be negative,

32:56.260 --> 32:58.580
or I'm not wishing that it's gonna flop.

32:58.580 --> 33:02.100
I just think the math for this launch

33:02.100 --> 33:05.300
doesn't add up the way it did the first time

33:05.300 --> 33:07.100
with the original PlayStation VR.

33:07.100 --> 33:10.060
I think the competition landscape looks a little different.

33:10.060 --> 33:12.400
I'm not sure there's that must-have title

33:12.400 --> 33:14.740
out of what we're seeing in the launch lineup.

33:14.740 --> 33:16.940
I think if people want to play Horizon Zero Dawn,

33:16.940 --> 33:19.520
Horizon Video West, they're gonna go play those games.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.380
I just don't think, again,

33:21.380 --> 33:23.720
I don't think there's that VR experience

33:23.720 --> 33:26.660
that people are begging for.

33:26.660 --> 33:28.420
YYR says, my prediction is that it sells out

33:28.420 --> 33:30.660
its initial launch shipment and then not much else.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.620
The tech looks amazing,

33:31.620 --> 33:35.840
but Sony is not supporting it properly with AAA games.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.980
Where is Spider-Man, Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted?

33:38.980 --> 33:41.660
Bingo, that is exactly it.

33:41.660 --> 33:42.580
On top of that too,

33:42.580 --> 33:46.280
like you look at just people's financial situations.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.360
We're in like a recession.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.040
People are just gonna drop $550

33:52.040 --> 33:54.360
after they dropped $500 for that console.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.940
Like that's a tough sell.

33:57.940 --> 34:00.140
And especially considering that that's more expensive

34:00.580 --> 34:03.220
than say getting a MetaQuest 2 or something like that,

34:03.220 --> 34:07.340
where that's a more affordable option

34:07.340 --> 34:10.340
and you have PC titles, which there are tons of,

34:10.340 --> 34:13.540
and you can get for much cheaper.

34:13.540 --> 34:15.540
Like, I just, I don't know.

34:15.540 --> 34:17.580
Like I said, I really do want to play

34:17.580 --> 34:18.780
that Dark Pictures game.

34:18.780 --> 34:21.700
I'm holding out that they put it on PC at some point.

34:21.700 --> 34:24.440
And if not, then so be it.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.720
I mean, I have Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,

34:26.720 --> 34:31.400
but like I haven't used my PlayStation VR in years.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.760
I haven't used my Rift in years,

34:32.760 --> 34:34.520
although I keep buying games for it though still,

34:34.520 --> 34:36.400
but I plan on it at some point,

34:36.400 --> 34:38.520
but I haven't used my PlayStation VR for a while

34:38.520 --> 34:40.020
and it's very dated.

34:40.020 --> 34:43.900
It's just sad that I can't like use that on PC.

34:43.900 --> 34:48.120
Like, poor Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, please.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.500
Put it on the PC.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.800
I think the one other thing I have to say,

34:50.800 --> 34:51.640
I think, you know,

34:51.640 --> 34:53.940
cause as much as I think Meta is actually unique,

34:53.940 --> 34:56.520
I think now we're seeing why they got into VR

34:57.160 --> 34:58.000
in the first place.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.640
And also like, again, if Meta takes it a step further,

35:01.640 --> 35:04.280
and I don't understand why they're not doing this more yet,

35:04.280 --> 35:05.840
but maybe it's coming, I don't know,

35:05.840 --> 35:08.800
and offers more experiences in VR

35:08.800 --> 35:11.640
and is able to sell VR to the Facebook audience.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.980
And let's be real, the Facebook crowd

35:12.980 --> 35:14.700
and the PlayStation crowd are,

35:14.700 --> 35:16.860
some of it overlaps, so not all of it right now.

35:16.860 --> 35:19.440
I actually think Meta is a little more uniquely positioned.

35:19.440 --> 35:24.440
However, there is a cloud looming all over all of this

35:24.800 --> 35:28.260
because there is another VR device.

35:28.260 --> 35:32.280
And if this VR device, A, is real,

35:32.280 --> 35:34.400
and B, launches in 2023.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.200
Eventually, whenever it decides to come out.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.320
The quote goes, it is over for you hoes.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.840
That is the quote for everybody else.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.420
Exactly, because they're gonna come out and be like,

35:43.420 --> 35:45.480
look it, we invented VR.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.640
It's the first time you could ever experience it

35:47.640 --> 35:49.000
because we came up with it.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.320
If Apple puts out a VR device,

35:51.320 --> 35:53.580
quote, it is over for you hoes.

35:53.580 --> 35:56.580
That is my official, you know what,

35:56.580 --> 35:58.260
that's my sub prediction.

35:58.260 --> 36:02.140
If Apple puts out a VR device, it is over for you hoes.

36:02.140 --> 36:05.000
That's what I'm writing on the card, all right?

36:05.000 --> 36:05.840
All right, let's move on

36:05.840 --> 36:07.220
because I think Dark Soccer probably has something

36:07.220 --> 36:09.860
that is not VR, but maybe she'll surprise me, I don't know.

36:09.860 --> 36:12.500
Dark Soccer, what's a prediction in your camp?

36:12.500 --> 36:15.360
That the Google Chromebook cloud gaming system

36:15.360 --> 36:17.060
is going to bomb.

36:18.140 --> 36:21.040
Oh, do I sense a little stadia bitterness?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.100
I'm not sure.

36:22.100 --> 36:22.940
Tell me about this prediction.

36:23.260 --> 36:24.620
That was a thing.

36:24.620 --> 36:26.860
They're the ones who analysis a week

36:26.860 --> 36:29.060
after saying they're getting rid of stadia.

36:30.340 --> 36:32.900
So I'm just calling it like I see it.

36:32.900 --> 36:37.900
People aren't gonna want to buy a whole laptop

36:38.740 --> 36:41.920
just for cloud gaming and certainly not a Chromebook.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.340
I mean, people are gonna want a good computer

36:44.340 --> 36:46.640
to play good games on, you know.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.700
I just don't see it successful.

36:51.780 --> 36:55.460
I 100% agree with you because I'm also just,

36:55.460 --> 36:59.180
no, nobody should support a Google gaming device

36:59.180 --> 37:01.560
knowing their track record at this point.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.180
Nobody should be buying that.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.340
My money back.

37:04.340 --> 37:06.420
Yeah, that's true, that's true, at least there's that.

37:06.420 --> 37:07.820
And I think that they might think,

37:07.820 --> 37:09.500
oh, well, that's gonna make it all better

37:09.500 --> 37:11.060
and we're gonna do this announcement.

37:11.060 --> 37:14.980
Some of us really enjoyed the platform, you know?

37:14.980 --> 37:17.780
It was a good way, especially like those games

37:17.780 --> 37:18.940
that like when they came out,

37:18.940 --> 37:21.740
they were all like glitchy and stuff, you know, Cyberpunk.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.540
I didn't have like a problem with it.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.480
It played beautifully.

37:26.480 --> 37:30.140
I mean, I did, Boosteroid kind of failed for me

37:30.140 --> 37:33.900
because their servers just were fairly weak

37:33.900 --> 37:37.460
and I'm on G-Force on like the middle program

37:37.460 --> 37:39.160
and that one's doing just fine.

37:40.300 --> 37:44.300
But at the same time, it's like that whole thing,

37:44.300 --> 37:49.300
just to come out with that announcement right afterwards,

37:50.340 --> 37:53.620
there's gonna be people who are gonna lobby against it,

37:53.620 --> 37:56.520
number one, people who are more bitter than I am.

37:58.020 --> 38:00.460
And then on top of that, there's just like,

38:01.320 --> 38:03.620
I already have all of this computer stuff.

38:03.620 --> 38:06.860
Why do I wanna buy another one just to play games on?

38:06.860 --> 38:07.700
Exactly.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.540
If they're gonna do that,

38:08.540 --> 38:11.300
they're gonna get a Steam Deck.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.140
Yeah, exactly.

38:12.140 --> 38:13.580
And that's the thing, it's like you look at,

38:13.700 --> 38:17.420
it's not necessarily just like a Google-developed device,

38:17.420 --> 38:19.820
it's more of like they're trying to sell Chromebooks

38:19.820 --> 38:21.140
a little bit more.

38:21.140 --> 38:24.420
And I mean, you look at the Chromebooks that they offer,

38:24.420 --> 38:25.780
like at least the one they highlight

38:25.780 --> 38:29.700
on the official Google page, the cheapest one's $3.99.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.620
I mean, you might as well just buy a Steam Deck

38:31.620 --> 38:32.460
at that point.

38:32.460 --> 38:34.860
You can do the cloud gaming on there

38:34.860 --> 38:36.260
and you can get Steam games

38:36.260 --> 38:37.980
and you can hook it up as a regular PC

38:37.980 --> 38:40.340
and be able to run a lot of decent stuff.

38:42.180 --> 38:43.560
No one should be messing with Chromebooks.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.200
You're literally like my grandparents

38:46.200 --> 38:50.240
who just check emails and maybe read the news and that's it.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.120
That's the only reason you would need a Chromebook.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.800
And even then, I would just suggest to get a tablet.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.320
It just doesn't make sense.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.920
I mean, seriously, all someone needs

38:58.920 --> 39:02.480
is an iPad Pro and a keyboard and you're set.

39:02.480 --> 39:05.440
Yeah, you don't need a Chromebook.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.980
It's a weird sell.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.880
It's like a Windows phone.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.400
I sold my laptop when I got my iPad Pro

39:12.400 --> 39:15.040
because it did everything my laptop did

39:15.040 --> 39:17.960
and I have a Mac Mini to work on all my other stuff.

39:17.960 --> 39:22.640
So yeah, the whole thing is just janky.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.120
All right, there's a lot of chat going on

39:27.120 --> 39:29.460
about the VR thing and that whole thing.

39:29.460 --> 39:30.500
And I just want to,

39:31.540 --> 39:33.600
because I thought it was a good comment here.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.760
GZDR4EV says, you don't want to watch

39:35.760 --> 39:38.960
The Last of Us TV show or the Twisted Metal show in VR.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.200
Personally, maybe I do,

39:41.200 --> 39:45.380
but not enough people to make a device like that,

39:45.380 --> 39:48.140
like sell, sell, sell would be interested.

39:48.140 --> 39:50.760
And it's a hard truth, I'm sorry.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.840
However, again, because this company

39:53.840 --> 39:55.520
knows how to make an entrance,

39:55.520 --> 39:58.220
if Apple were to unveil one of those devices,

39:58.220 --> 39:59.920
I'm telling you, they're going to have people

39:59.920 --> 40:01.820
watching the new Avatar movie in it.

40:01.820 --> 40:04.960
And even if you personally don't like that answer,

40:04.960 --> 40:07.160
I'm telling you, look at the box office,

40:07.160 --> 40:08.860
look at the track record.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.900
It's going to move beaucoup.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.900
If, you know, again, this is all, you know,

40:13.900 --> 40:15.220
we know it's something they're-

40:15.220 --> 40:16.060
Print money.

40:16.060 --> 40:18.060
Yeah, we know it's something they're experimenting with.

40:18.060 --> 40:19.440
We don't know when, we don't know where,

40:19.440 --> 40:20.780
we don't even know if it'll actually happen.

40:20.780 --> 40:21.900
Experimenting with it doesn't mean

40:21.900 --> 40:23.180
they're ever going to do anything with it.

40:23.180 --> 40:24.940
So, but yes, print money.

40:24.940 --> 40:27.600
Yeah, you know that question mark, question mark,

40:27.600 --> 40:30.400
question mark, step one,

40:31.420 --> 40:33.540
Avatar in 3D home device,

40:33.540 --> 40:37.220
question mark, question mark, question mark, profit, okay?

40:37.220 --> 40:39.380
Apple has a team dedicated to that question mark,

40:39.380 --> 40:40.820
question mark, question mark right now.

40:40.820 --> 40:43.140
And either they're going to figure it out or they're not.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.500
And that's where it goes from here.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.020
Anyway, moving on, back to the gaming producer bit,

40:47.020 --> 40:49.180
just since the chat is dominated with that talk,

40:49.180 --> 40:51.060
I wanted to acknowledge that.

40:51.060 --> 40:54.340
Okay, so back to predictions.

40:54.340 --> 40:55.880
Loki, what's another one?

40:57.740 --> 40:58.700
Let's see.

41:03.220 --> 41:05.900
I think that-

41:05.900 --> 41:06.820
And don't forget chat.

41:07.380 --> 41:08.420
We are looking for your predictions too.

41:08.420 --> 41:10.580
So don't forget to holler some of those out.

41:14.660 --> 41:18.820
I think that the Activision, Blizzard,

41:18.820 --> 41:23.100
Microsoft merger is never going to go through.

41:24.700 --> 41:26.780
And what, why doesn't it go through?

41:28.740 --> 41:33.740
Because they'll try to make an example of them somehow.

41:34.060 --> 41:36.100
I don't know why they'd be punishing that,

41:36.580 --> 41:37.940
entertainment company.

41:37.940 --> 41:42.060
But the way I see it is like, it wouldn't go through.

41:42.060 --> 41:43.220
And then when it doesn't go through,

41:43.220 --> 41:44.580
Sony will try to buy them.

41:45.780 --> 41:48.340
They'll try to buy Activision, Blizzard.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.580
That is so shady, but I could see it.

41:51.580 --> 41:52.900
Absolutely, I could see it.

41:52.900 --> 41:54.960
So by the way, if y'all hear me typing,

41:54.960 --> 41:57.620
it's because I am officially recording our predictions

41:57.620 --> 41:58.460
to the record.

41:58.460 --> 42:01.820
So please excuse my mechanical keyboard noises in the back.

42:01.820 --> 42:05.140
All right, let's go, I guess I'll just go next

42:05.180 --> 42:07.500
since I kind of created that order last time.

42:07.500 --> 42:10.620
So my number two, okay.

42:10.620 --> 42:13.180
Again, I hate to be negative,

42:13.180 --> 42:16.300
but I think it's one of those things at the end of the day

42:16.300 --> 42:18.480
is going to benefit this company at the end of the day.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.780
And my prediction is that

42:19.780 --> 42:22.940
Yoshisuke Matsuda is forced out of Square Enix.

42:22.940 --> 42:25.500
I think all this talk about NFTs,

42:25.500 --> 42:29.300
I think the way the general company's been kind of run,

42:30.180 --> 42:31.980
and I think ultimately,

42:32.980 --> 42:37.740
I'm not saying Final Fantasy XVI doesn't do well,

42:38.580 --> 42:43.320
but I think the way the company has kind of failed

42:43.320 --> 42:45.700
to respond to some of these issues,

42:45.700 --> 42:48.220
such as the lack of diversity in the game.

42:49.780 --> 42:52.380
And I know there is a subset of gamers probably

42:52.380 --> 42:53.440
that don't listen to this show,

42:53.440 --> 42:54.980
but there's probably a subset of gamers out there

42:54.980 --> 42:56.260
that roll their eyes when I say that.

42:56.260 --> 42:59.180
And my answer to that is, tough titty,

42:59.220 --> 43:02.400
because this does ultimately impact sales.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.920
People want to see themselves represented in games, period.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.800
And although I still stand by

43:08.800 --> 43:12.880
that this is a Japanese game industry problem,

43:12.880 --> 43:14.340
here's the problem.

43:14.340 --> 43:17.560
Now Square Enix is the poster child for that problem,

43:17.560 --> 43:22.560
because Matsuda has failed to deflect the issue

43:23.140 --> 43:27.380
or respond to it in any way, really.

43:27.380 --> 43:32.380
And although I think Final Fantasy XVI does fine enough,

43:33.140 --> 43:37.380
I think this is something we're gonna be reminded of

43:37.380 --> 43:42.380
in many interviews, many reviews, many things,

43:42.500 --> 43:47.500
that some would say it starts to be a distraction.

43:49.140 --> 43:51.280
It's not a distraction, I wanna be clear,

43:51.280 --> 43:54.740
but some would say that, especially in Japan.

43:54.740 --> 43:56.420
And I think ultimately Matsuda-san,

43:56.420 --> 44:00.340
between that and the NFT issue,

44:00.340 --> 44:04.660
and I think this whole sale of the other stuff

44:04.660 --> 44:06.640
with now that we know Crystal Dynamics

44:06.640 --> 44:08.700
is making a Tomb Raider thing for Amazon,

44:08.700 --> 44:10.340
I think all of these things are gonna be viewed

44:10.340 --> 44:12.500
as poor fucking decisions

44:12.500 --> 44:14.860
that we're trying to set the company up for being acquired,

44:14.860 --> 44:17.780
and I don't think it gets acquired,

44:17.780 --> 44:22.120
especially if what Loki just said plays out,

44:22.120 --> 44:24.380
Square Enix is gonna get left at the altar

44:24.900 --> 44:26.060
so that Sony can buy Activision Blizzard.

44:26.060 --> 44:27.700
Of course, does that mean Microsoft buys Square Enix?

44:27.700 --> 44:28.680
I don't know.

44:28.680 --> 44:33.300
I kinda don't think Square Enix is bought this year,

44:33.300 --> 44:35.700
and I think Matsuda-san pays the price for that

44:35.700 --> 44:38.320
because the good thing

44:38.320 --> 44:40.200
about the Japanese game development culture

44:40.200 --> 44:43.020
is that it holds its leaders accountable,

44:43.020 --> 44:45.540
unlike a certain Mr. Kotek.

44:45.540 --> 44:48.700
So I think Matsuda pays the price

44:48.700 --> 44:50.760
and leaves Square Enix this year.

44:50.760 --> 44:52.340
That's my thought.

44:53.340 --> 44:57.340
So, DarkSakura, do you have something more positive?

44:58.260 --> 45:00.140
Speaking of Kotek,

45:01.420 --> 45:03.740
I think one way or another,

45:03.740 --> 45:06.340
the company's going to be purchased,

45:06.340 --> 45:10.740
and not only is he going to find himself out of a job,

45:10.740 --> 45:12.620
I have a feeling that there are gonna be

45:12.620 --> 45:17.620
even more legal proceedings against him personally.

45:17.900 --> 45:20.220
You know, people are gonna dig up dirt.

45:20.220 --> 45:23.100
He deserves to have everything thrown at him

45:23.100 --> 45:24.100
and buried for it.

45:25.900 --> 45:27.940
Maybe that's wishful thinking,

45:27.940 --> 45:31.900
but I would love to see a crusty,

45:31.900 --> 45:34.580
horrible man in power just suffer.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.100
That's all.

45:39.740 --> 45:41.380
Can't say I would,

45:41.380 --> 45:44.660
I mean, the only problem is

45:44.660 --> 45:47.380
he'll just laugh on his bed of money the whole way out,

45:47.380 --> 45:48.740
and so that sucks,

45:48.740 --> 45:53.740
but I do agree that the name should not be looked on fondly.

45:53.980 --> 45:56.380
The history books can still record

45:56.380 --> 45:57.220
somebody's name a certain way.

45:57.220 --> 46:02.020
I want to see him completely lose

46:02.020 --> 46:05.980
just any semblance of future business opportunities,

46:05.980 --> 46:07.380
all because of this.

46:07.380 --> 46:08.220
That'll never happen.

46:08.220 --> 46:09.060
He'll get promoted.

46:09.060 --> 46:10.380
He'll leave the company and go somewhere else

46:10.380 --> 46:12.980
and be super god of whatever company it is.

46:12.980 --> 46:13.780
Fucking men.

46:13.780 --> 46:16.140
Sorry, don't mean it that way, but-

46:16.140 --> 46:16.980
No, I get it.

46:17.700 --> 46:19.500
I sort of, yes.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.420
I think to what Loki's saying,

46:21.420 --> 46:24.420
I do think he ends up on the boards of certain companies,

46:24.420 --> 46:26.660
but I think the companies he ends up on the boards of

46:26.660 --> 46:27.940
are just kind of like,

46:27.940 --> 46:29.620
they're gonna be fucking NFT companies

46:29.620 --> 46:31.060
and things that are bullshit anyway.

46:31.060 --> 46:33.340
Like that's how I sort of see it playing out.

46:33.340 --> 46:36.500
Not gonna have any meaningful opportunities.

46:36.500 --> 46:37.340
Right.

46:38.820 --> 46:40.020
All right, let's go-

46:40.020 --> 46:42.100
Of course, I have another idea,

46:42.100 --> 46:43.780
but I'm not gonna say it loud.

46:47.020 --> 46:48.580
All right.

46:48.580 --> 46:50.620
No, it's not violent.

46:50.620 --> 46:51.620
All right, fair enough.

46:51.620 --> 46:52.940
Okay, let's go.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.300
One more prediction from everyone.

46:54.300 --> 46:55.140
Loki.

46:56.100 --> 46:58.220
All right, so I'm gonna give you two

46:58.220 --> 46:59.780
just because one's gonna be runner up

46:59.780 --> 47:01.100
because it's more of like a wish

47:01.100 --> 47:02.940
and I know it's never gonna come true anyways, but-

47:02.940 --> 47:04.020
You can always break the rules around here.

47:04.020 --> 47:04.860
That's fine.

47:04.860 --> 47:05.860
That's fine.

47:05.860 --> 47:07.860
So my official one is gonna be that

47:07.860 --> 47:10.180
Nintendo's gonna finally announce that new console

47:10.180 --> 47:11.500
that they've got cooking up.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.620
It's not coming out until next year though.

47:13.620 --> 47:14.780
I guess that's awfully safe,

47:14.820 --> 47:17.260
but it'll be right around the corner.

47:18.220 --> 47:19.060
So there's that.

47:19.060 --> 47:23.180
And then my second kind of a wish

47:23.180 --> 47:24.780
that I would wish would happen is

47:24.780 --> 47:27.420
the cocaine bear game is gonna be insane

47:27.420 --> 47:29.260
and it's gonna be awesome.

47:29.260 --> 47:30.900
And I just hope it comes out.

47:30.900 --> 47:33.100
Except they're not making a cocaine bear game.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.220
And that's a very,

47:34.220 --> 47:37.280
I absolute missed opportunity right there.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.120
I'm telling you.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.400
They're not making a Megan game either.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.240
And let me tell you-

47:40.240 --> 47:41.060
I know.

47:41.060 --> 47:42.260
That is one of the best movies I've seen

47:42.260 --> 47:43.100
in a long time.

47:43.100 --> 47:44.060
I want to see that.

47:44.740 --> 47:45.580
I want to see that.

47:45.580 --> 47:46.540
I want to see cocaine bear.

47:46.540 --> 47:49.500
And I still want to see violent night at some point.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.940
I just can't, you know,

47:51.940 --> 47:54.540
probably end up having to watch it on streaming.

47:54.540 --> 47:55.980
So quick aside,

47:55.980 --> 47:58.900
because you know I love me a good Shane story here on OLR.

47:58.900 --> 47:59.820
You know, my friend, Shane,

47:59.820 --> 48:02.580
who's guested on my stream and has been on this show

48:02.580 --> 48:04.500
time and time again over the years.

48:04.500 --> 48:07.260
He told me he was going to go see Megan with some friends.

48:07.260 --> 48:08.260
And I'm kind of like,

48:08.260 --> 48:11.160
I don't know if that is going to really be up Shane's alley,

48:11.160 --> 48:12.060
but I'm like,

48:12.060 --> 48:15.960
I'm dying to know what you think of Megan.

48:15.960 --> 48:19.700
Please call me as soon as you leave the theater.

48:19.700 --> 48:20.520
And he did.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.040
He called me and he's like,

48:23.040 --> 48:24.980
that wasn't a horror movie.

48:24.980 --> 48:26.820
That was a comedy,

48:26.820 --> 48:27.860
but it was funny.

48:27.860 --> 48:29.700
It looks funny.

48:29.700 --> 48:32.100
And I would say that it isn't really a horror movie.

48:32.100 --> 48:32.940
It's a comedy.

48:32.940 --> 48:33.780
It's like,

48:33.780 --> 48:35.700
see my favorite horror movie is Elvira,

48:35.700 --> 48:36.860
Mistress of the Dark.

48:36.860 --> 48:38.060
And that's what most people would say.

48:38.060 --> 48:39.420
That's not a horror movie.

48:39.420 --> 48:40.680
That's a comedy.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.140
And it's like,

48:42.140 --> 48:43.360
yes,

48:43.360 --> 48:44.200
but it's,

48:44.200 --> 48:46.680
I think horror can be anyone's genre.

48:46.680 --> 48:47.600
Yes, it is.

48:47.600 --> 48:49.120
There can be funny horror movies.

48:49.120 --> 48:49.960
Exactly.

48:49.960 --> 48:53.820
And it's even funnier if you just kind of close your eyes

48:53.820 --> 48:57.820
for just a second and imagine it's not Megan, the doll,

48:57.820 --> 48:59.400
it's Michelle Tanner.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
It's even funnier.

49:05.780 --> 49:06.620
All right.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.980
Dark Sakura, like seriously,

49:10.140 --> 49:12.020
I will see it again if you need a date.

49:12.020 --> 49:12.860
Just saying.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.640
I have a couple of things that I want to see.

49:17.640 --> 49:18.480
That one was on the spot.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.300
We should do that.

49:19.300 --> 49:20.220
We'll do a triple date.

49:20.220 --> 49:21.060
Come on.

49:21.060 --> 49:21.900
I would love to see that movie.

49:21.900 --> 49:22.740
Triple date.

49:22.740 --> 49:23.560
Yay.

49:23.560 --> 49:24.400
I'd love that.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.220
All right.

49:25.220 --> 49:26.340
When was the last time the three of us hang out

49:26.340 --> 49:28.260
in the same physical space?

49:28.260 --> 49:29.100
When we,

49:29.100 --> 49:29.940
I don't know.

49:29.940 --> 49:31.900
I remember when the last times we went on a triple date

49:31.900 --> 49:33.740
was to go see the original Avatar.

49:33.740 --> 49:36.100
So it would be really fucking funny

49:36.100 --> 49:37.740
if the next time we go on a triple date

49:37.740 --> 49:40.540
was to see the counter-programming to Avatar.

49:43.540 --> 49:44.380
I still haven't seen it.

49:44.380 --> 49:45.200
Yeah, I still.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.380
I do actually want to see.

49:46.380 --> 49:48.980
I'm mildly interested in Avatar, the new one.

49:48.980 --> 49:51.140
I hear it's good, but that was the way I felt

49:51.140 --> 49:51.980
about the first one.

49:51.980 --> 49:54.380
The first one I was like, eh, I'm okay.

49:54.380 --> 49:56.060
And I saw it and I was like, it's all right.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.340
I'm waiting for Blu-ray

49:57.340 --> 49:59.220
because I know I'm going to need a poop break

49:59.220 --> 50:00.180
with that movie.

50:00.180 --> 50:01.300
Like, let's be real.

50:01.300 --> 50:02.980
That movie is long.

50:02.980 --> 50:04.660
I just went on streaming that one.

50:04.660 --> 50:05.800
Yeah.

50:05.800 --> 50:06.640
All right.

50:07.740 --> 50:09.900
Let's see.

50:09.900 --> 50:12.620
Pod culture says, OLR, the movie review podcast.

50:12.620 --> 50:13.460
You never know.

50:13.460 --> 50:14.740
You know, we have a TikTok now.

50:14.740 --> 50:17.380
We could record these adventures to the movies.

50:17.380 --> 50:18.200
I'm just saying.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.040
All right.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.120
My turn.

50:21.120 --> 50:21.960
Okay.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.020
Oops, sorry.

50:23.020 --> 50:28.020
Somebody actually posted something that's very adjacent

50:28.540 --> 50:31.520
to what I'm about to say, which is, it is a good thing.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.040
And I'm going bold.

50:33.040 --> 50:36.580
I'm swinging for the rafters with this prediction.

50:36.580 --> 50:39.640
But I think we have a big year for games.

50:39.640 --> 50:40.620
That's not the prediction.

50:40.620 --> 50:41.660
That's the truth.

50:41.660 --> 50:43.100
We have like Starfield.

50:43.100 --> 50:44.860
We have a new Zelda game coming out.

50:44.860 --> 50:46.620
We have Final Fantasy 16.

50:46.620 --> 50:47.940
We have Diablo four.

50:47.940 --> 50:50.180
Like we have game after game after game.

50:50.180 --> 50:52.420
This is a huge year for games.

50:52.420 --> 50:53.500
And you know what?

50:53.500 --> 50:56.420
As long as everybody else is getting in on it,

50:56.420 --> 51:00.800
my prediction is Valve releases A3.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.700
It's 2023.

51:04.700 --> 51:05.540
It is time.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.700
Valve releases A3.

51:07.700 --> 51:08.960
What three?

51:08.960 --> 51:09.800
That's up to them.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.300
And I'm not going to go that far.

51:11.300 --> 51:13.720
Although some would argue Half-Life Alyx was a three,

51:13.720 --> 51:15.100
but we're not going to go there.

51:15.100 --> 51:16.180
I'm going to say Valve.

51:16.180 --> 51:17.420
There's no three in the title.

51:17.420 --> 51:18.260
It doesn't count.

51:18.260 --> 51:19.500
It releases A3.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.300
Yeah, if there's no three in the title, it doesn't count.

51:21.300 --> 51:24.540
Unless, as Bobby Blackwolf says, that title is Megan.

51:24.540 --> 51:25.420
That will count.

51:27.420 --> 51:29.740
Which of course is M3GAN.

51:29.740 --> 51:33.020
A Valve Megan game will absolutely count, period.

51:33.020 --> 51:35.380
Just putting that in the footnote.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.020
But otherwise, yes, it must have a three.

51:37.020 --> 51:41.980
We must have Left 4 Dead 3, Half-Life 3, Portal 3,

51:41.980 --> 51:43.920
like any of these will work.

51:44.880 --> 51:45.720
All right.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.640
In 2023, this is the year to do it.

51:48.640 --> 51:51.340
You have a three in the year title.

51:51.340 --> 51:52.500
Yeah, as two and a half Matt says,

51:52.500 --> 51:54.340
we can keep predicting three with Valve.

51:54.340 --> 51:56.220
At some point, it will come true.

51:56.220 --> 51:58.140
And the time they will announce it?

51:58.140 --> 51:58.980
E3.

52:03.500 --> 52:04.340
I don't know.

52:04.340 --> 52:05.180
I'm not convinced.

52:05.820 --> 52:06.940
I would take a Team Fortress 3.

52:06.940 --> 52:07.860
I really would.

52:07.860 --> 52:09.060
I think it'd be fantastic.

52:09.060 --> 52:09.940
Hell yes.

52:09.940 --> 52:14.220
And like, I would argue Overwatch is vulnerable.

52:14.220 --> 52:16.620
Like, I'm not gonna say, like, I'm not talking shit.

52:16.620 --> 52:18.340
I enjoyed Overwatch 2.

52:18.340 --> 52:20.640
I would just say, I don't think Blizzard

52:20.640 --> 52:25.640
is the king of that hill the way it's assumed they are.

52:26.180 --> 52:27.700
And I think a Team Fortress 3

52:27.700 --> 52:30.920
could absolutely disrupt things severely.

52:30.920 --> 52:32.960
And, I don't know how funny,

52:32.960 --> 52:35.320
people are talking about Steam Deck 3.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.880
I'm not sure Steam Deck 3 counts,

52:36.880 --> 52:40.100
but I think Steam Deck is just motivation for them to do it.

52:40.100 --> 52:40.940
So.

52:40.940 --> 52:43.160
I'll just do Counter Strike Go 2.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.000
You're like, dammit.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.160
Yeah.

52:45.160 --> 52:46.160
Phil of Nine in chat says,

52:46.160 --> 52:48.080
I played Overwatch 2 for a month and was like,

52:48.080 --> 52:50.080
wait, this is the same game as Overwatch 1.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.680
I mean, if you want to get technical,

52:51.680 --> 52:53.960
it's 5v5, not 6v6, huh?

52:53.960 --> 52:55.160
But I get it.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.120
Cause I also played for a month and now I'm like,

52:57.120 --> 52:59.000
okay, like that was cute.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.460
So I would absolutely check out a Team Fortress 3.

53:01.460 --> 53:02.800
I think y'all laugh,

53:03.480 --> 53:04.880
but that absolutely could be the game.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.480
And it counts cause a three would be in it.

53:07.480 --> 53:08.300
All right.

53:08.300 --> 53:11.000
Last but certainly not least, Dark Sakura,

53:11.000 --> 53:12.340
a bold third prediction,

53:12.340 --> 53:14.240
bold third three prediction from you.

53:20.040 --> 53:20.880
I don't know.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.120
I really don't know.

53:25.040 --> 53:28.620
I literally cannot think of anything.

53:29.620 --> 53:31.940
Jamie's prediction.

53:31.940 --> 53:33.440
I literally can't.

53:33.440 --> 53:38.440
How about you predict a killer for 2023 and.

53:39.060 --> 53:40.780
Is this Jason's year?

53:40.780 --> 53:43.820
Well, I have a list and a few of them

53:43.820 --> 53:46.620
have some substantial evidence behind them.

53:48.380 --> 53:53.380
So I am hoping that we get Candyman.

53:54.380 --> 53:58.980
That would be amazing or, or a pumpkin head.

54:00.980 --> 54:05.720
But actually what I see happening,

54:05.720 --> 54:08.820
and this also may be wishful thinking is that I think

54:08.820 --> 54:12.700
they're going to do even more retooling of the game

54:12.700 --> 54:16.660
to remove any benefit from camping and tunneling.

54:17.680 --> 54:20.640
I think just in general, it needs a rework.

54:20.880 --> 54:24.800
They need to skip a patch cycle to just work on the game.

54:24.800 --> 54:25.640
Like it's.

54:25.640 --> 54:28.160
The thing is that new players are doing it.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.400
You see it really heavily at rank reset

54:31.320 --> 54:35.680
and they think that this is how you're supposed to play.

54:35.680 --> 54:40.040
And sorry, kills do not equal skills.

54:40.040 --> 54:42.360
It means you are cheap and lazy.

54:42.360 --> 54:43.720
So let me answer this in chat

54:43.720 --> 54:45.600
because I'm going to take this question seriously

54:45.600 --> 54:46.760
and give you a serious answer.

54:46.760 --> 54:50.680
So Tiger Claw in chat says, how about Megan as a DLC?

54:50.680 --> 54:53.720
And as much as I want to jump out of my seat and go, yes,

54:53.720 --> 54:55.720
yes, it's not going to happen.

54:55.720 --> 54:56.680
I'm going to tell you why.

54:56.680 --> 54:57.520
Because go back.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.640
She's a child.

54:58.640 --> 55:02.360
There's that Android, but yes, I know.

55:02.360 --> 55:06.040
Cause the ring is also a child.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.320
She's not, but she's not a child.

55:07.320 --> 55:08.440
She's 19.

55:08.440 --> 55:09.640
Oh, I thought she was a child.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.480
All right, anyway.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.100
No, that's only in the, in the crappy,

55:12.100 --> 55:14.600
horrible American version and the Japanese version.

55:14.600 --> 55:15.440
Okay, thank you.

55:15.440 --> 55:19.240
The whole story is of her going to be an actress,

55:19.240 --> 55:21.080
how she kills her acting troop,

55:21.080 --> 55:22.560
goes back and her dad kills her.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.840
Well, I just always think of the, I'm sorry,

55:24.840 --> 55:28.040
but she has the best hooking emotion in the entire game

55:28.040 --> 55:30.120
where she has to lift them up and the hook comes down

55:30.120 --> 55:32.840
because she shows sword and then goes back up.

55:32.840 --> 55:34.200
It's so funny.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.600
Anyway, but I love Sadako.

55:35.600 --> 55:38.040
But Sadako is canonically a young adult.

55:39.240 --> 55:40.880
Okay, fair enough.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.680
S2 and Hunter Matt says, what about the Babadook?

55:42.680 --> 55:43.960
For Pride Month, I totally take him.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.120
Oh, I want to go back to the Megan thing

55:45.640 --> 55:46.480
and why not?

55:46.480 --> 55:48.080
Because of Shane's review.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.000
It's not a horror movie, it's a comedy.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.720
And I think ultimately that is,

55:51.720 --> 55:53.520
that is what it boils down to.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.080
If they're going to give us that,

55:55.080 --> 55:57.760
then they should give us the comedy

55:57.760 --> 56:00.000
that would be an even better,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.400
I'm going to say yes, this would be even better

56:02.400 --> 56:05.560
for Dead by Daylight.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.600
Evil Dead though.

56:06.600 --> 56:07.960
Oh, no, when I say comedy,

56:07.960 --> 56:10.240
I mean we need Brenda Meeks from Scary Movie.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.080
That's the one that we need.

56:13.080 --> 56:15.560
The rumor was for the longest time

56:15.560 --> 56:17.320
that we were supposed to get Sidney

56:17.320 --> 56:19.040
when we got Ghostface,

56:19.040 --> 56:20.760
except it's just the Ghostface

56:20.760 --> 56:23.440
and not, you know, the movie character.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.520
Also, I think unfortunately

56:25.520 --> 56:27.480
with what Nev Campbell's going through,

56:27.480 --> 56:28.520
I mean, I...

56:28.520 --> 56:30.840
Yeah, I mean, I'm just said in general.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.000
But there's no, I mean,

56:33.000 --> 56:36.240
Jenny Ortega is literally everywhere right now.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.800
There's no reason her, I mean,

56:37.800 --> 56:39.960
I know I should bite my tongue immediately

56:40.000 --> 56:42.600
that I ever say, you know, Sidney is replaceable.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.720
She's not, but let's be real,

56:44.720 --> 56:48.160
we didn't get Heather Lagenkamp with the...

56:48.160 --> 56:49.880
Because they did the new version.

56:49.880 --> 56:50.920
They did the new version.

56:50.920 --> 56:53.600
So I would say you'd have a better chance

56:53.600 --> 56:54.840
of getting Jenny Ortega,

56:54.840 --> 56:57.160
I can't remember her name in the screen, sorry.

56:57.160 --> 56:58.000
Was it Sam?

56:58.000 --> 56:58.840
No, Sam was the other person.

56:58.840 --> 57:00.640
I didn't, I don't like those movies.

57:00.640 --> 57:04.240
But anyway, especially because her particularly

57:04.240 --> 57:06.200
between that and Wednesday,

57:06.200 --> 57:08.120
she's having a real good year.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.280
She had a really good 2022.

57:09.440 --> 57:10.680
Season two, baby.

57:10.680 --> 57:11.640
Can't wait.

57:11.640 --> 57:14.000
Yeah, she's having a good year, so.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.400
If you want the, you know, the feel of Harry Potter,

57:17.400 --> 57:19.600
but you don't wanna support Harry Potter,

57:19.600 --> 57:20.880
Wednesday's your ticket.

57:21.880 --> 57:24.120
That is a glowing reveal, actually.

57:25.560 --> 57:27.040
I mean, it's basically Harry Potter.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.040
It's except without, you know.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.520
Without transphobia. Transphobia.

57:30.520 --> 57:32.920
I, and I love, I've always loved the Addams family.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.000
So I'm here for that.

57:34.000 --> 57:34.840
It's great.

57:34.840 --> 57:36.280
I love that series.

57:36.280 --> 57:38.320
We made our kids watch it and it's great.

57:39.680 --> 57:41.040
To go back though,

57:42.120 --> 57:45.040
I think that some of these rumored licenses,

57:45.040 --> 57:48.720
we are going to start seeing them around.

57:48.720 --> 57:51.000
Candyman has been teased for a while

57:51.000 --> 57:53.840
and the actor of the original Candyman

57:53.840 --> 57:56.600
was approached to work with behavior.

57:57.480 --> 57:59.400
And they're often saying that they'll work

57:59.400 --> 58:02.360
on their chapters sometimes years in advance.

58:02.360 --> 58:03.280
Yeah.

58:03.280 --> 58:05.120
I would, I would love, I mean,

58:05.120 --> 58:07.280
I was right about Wesker, wasn't I?

58:08.120 --> 58:10.600
Well, it wasn't too hard to predict, but yes.

58:10.600 --> 58:12.840
Yeah, but I mean, we had Nemesis first

58:12.840 --> 58:14.760
and I was like, it's gonna be Wesker.

58:16.800 --> 58:21.560
I also am thinking that there's going to be

58:21.560 --> 58:23.960
a new, another graphical overhaul

58:23.960 --> 58:28.560
for some of the areas that hadn't,

58:28.560 --> 58:32.320
or that maybe were overhauled a little bit longer ago.

58:33.240 --> 58:36.600
And I certainly think that the stupid Borga area,

58:36.760 --> 58:39.520
the Knights area is gonna be changed.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.520
It looks terrible.

58:41.520 --> 58:42.880
It looks like old Cornwind.

58:44.480 --> 58:45.360
All right.

58:45.360 --> 58:48.200
So let's put them in, lock them in.

58:48.200 --> 58:50.480
So here are the recaps one more time.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.320
PSVR2 impossible to find.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.160
PSVR2 flops.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.200
Google Chrome game book bombs.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.160
ABK Microsoft merger doesn't go through

58:58.160 --> 59:00.160
and an example is made of them.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.040
Matsuda forced out of Square Enix.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.520
Kotick forced out of the working world completely.

59:04.520 --> 59:06.360
Nintendo finally announces new console

59:06.960 --> 59:09.400
for what they're cooking up next year.

59:09.400 --> 59:11.800
Cocaine Bear game is insane and awesome.

59:11.800 --> 59:14.800
Valve releases a three, literally can't even,

59:14.800 --> 59:15.920
I'm still putting that in there

59:15.920 --> 59:19.400
and DVD Candyman or Pumpkinhead were the,

59:19.400 --> 59:21.040
kind of the first two that I picked up there.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.360
So, all right, there you go.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.120
Cause I think it'd be funny to look back.

59:25.120 --> 59:27.360
Why did Jamie predict literally can't even?

59:28.400 --> 59:29.240
Is that a prediction?

59:29.240 --> 59:30.080
Because I couldn't.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.800
I mean, and there's gonna be new chapters, you know?

59:34.800 --> 59:37.240
I mean, we even are talking about other changes

59:37.240 --> 59:39.320
coming to Dead by Daylight,

59:39.320 --> 59:41.760
rumored with very reliable resources.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.960
Get to that in a little bit.

59:44.960 --> 59:48.080
Meanwhile, probably speaking of Dead by Daylight,

59:48.080 --> 59:50.080
let's get to what we've been doing this week

59:50.080 --> 59:51.360
in our gaming weeks.

59:51.360 --> 59:53.680
So let's get to, how was your gaming week?

59:53.680 --> 59:54.520
Dark Sakura.

59:55.720 --> 59:57.160
I played Dead by Daylight.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.040
I actually played Killer.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.880
Oh yeah, I peeked at your stream for a little bit

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.440
and I saw you playing Pig and I was like,

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.720
oh, she's back on her pig bullshit.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.960
Rob, that pig game?

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.520
Adept first try.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.160
Oh, good job, congrats.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.840
Right after that, Freddy, Adept first try.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.480
Lucky you.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.800
I almost got Adept for Nemesis

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.680
because I actually got a 3K and the hatch

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.840
and someone managed to, no, I didn't get the hatch.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.560
It was in Cornwind, so it was really hard to find the hatch.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.960
So someone got it.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.960
But it was a pretty solid 3K, that one.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.840
And I got a lot better with his tentacle power.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.520
But I had a really shitty pyramid head game

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.120
and people were just being children.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.400
And so I was like,

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.040
well, I'm gonna go play another pyramid head game.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.760
I got to get another 20 seconds of chase in.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.840
And that's when the power went out, end of my stream.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.480
I had gone a whole hour longer, so I'm not mad about it.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.520
But I hated that it was on that terrible pyramid head game.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.240
I'm a little worried for you tonight, though,

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.880
because I think the rain starts around 10 o'clock, 10 30.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.280
So fingers and toes crossed

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.960
you make it through tonight's stream after the OLR.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.680
See, I'm gonna be doing,

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.800
I mean, tonight is quite likely gonna be

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.080
a survivor night anyway,

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.160
unless Gwen doesn't wanna play.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.720
And other than that, then I'll find ways of doing things.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.240
I'm still trying to work through my Adepts

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.040
and if I may say so,

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.120
I'm doing a subathon on Friday the 13th,

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.200
starting noon to midnight.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.240
Yeah, I picked it on purpose.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.800
It's also like the weekend before I go back to work maybe.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.800
So if you wanna see the shenanigans, come on by.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.160
You might even get to play with me.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.400
I'll try to make a cameo.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.480
I have to work Friday, of course, but I'll try to-

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.120
Well, it's going until midnight.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:57.960
So you got time.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.800
Okay, I got time in the evening.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.320
I have to travel Friday too,

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.160
assuming there isn't another fricking storm

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.440
because apparently they're all back to back to back.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.720
But anyway.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah, it is what it is.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.840
It is what it is.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.600
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.960
It was all Minecraft again.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.560
So I finished up an episode and put that out.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.120
And now I'm working in my modded series too.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.120
I need to film something for that.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.920
I've been just actually playing it.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.320
So more to come.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.760
All right, my gaming week.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.880
I've continued on my MMO stuff,

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.680
but now I'm kind of doing equal time

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.360
with Final Fantasy XIV and WoW.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.600
And I have to say,

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.240
I kind of thought I hit the point where I was kind of like,

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.600
okay, I think I'm done with WoW

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.440
just because I ran out of things to do.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.960
Like I beat the main campaign.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.160
I'm not interested in really raiding and all that stuff.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.040
And I was like, eh, I could do mythics,

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.240
but I don't really know if I'll get a group or whatever.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.600
And then like out of the blue,

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.160
I'm on during world quests and Extrofer from Horde House,

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.200
his husband is playing right now

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.400
and like sent me a message and went,

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.960
hey, you want to heal a mythic for us?

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.800
And I was like, all right, sure, I'll try.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.200
And I'm like, I'm not very good.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.040
I don't know how it's going to go.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.000
He's like, whatever, whatever, let's just do it.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.640
And sure enough, we changed like four mythics.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.560
We got my keystone all the way to level eight.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.720
We beat, or we actually got it all the way to level 10

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.960
because we beat Temple of the Jade Serpent on level eight.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.160
And I thought that was neat too.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.200
I didn't realize they throw classic dungeons, just a few,

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.280
but like Temple of the Jade Serpent from Pandaria

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.360
and the Shadow Moon Burial Grounds from Draenor

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.400
are like actually in the classic rotation

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.480
of mythic dungeons.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.400
I thought that was pretty cool.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.640
So, cause that's something I've kind of wanted WoW

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.720
to do for a while is bring back their old content

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.640
in a meaningful way.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.080
And they're actually kind of doing that.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.760
So I'm going to give them kudos for taking that feedback.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.320
But then Final Fantasy has a big patch on Tuesday

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.360
and I'm prepping for that

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.520
because Island Sanctuary is getting updates

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.120
and I love Island Sanctuary.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.520
So I'm really excited about that.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.920
So yeah, MMO, MMO.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.640
Did I play anything that wasn't an MMO?

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.640
Yes, I dabbled with Portal, the original,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
but you might remember they recently re-released it

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.400
as Portal with RTX.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.800
And I was curious, I was like,

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.280
oh, I wonder I have a newer machine.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.600
I wonder how that's going to run.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.800
So I fired it up and it turns out it's the first game

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.560
that my nice brand new computer

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.720
kind of chokes on a little bit,

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.760
at least in 4K, which yeah,

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.600
you want to do 4K RTX, okay, look, I know.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.880
My graphics card is pretty good, but it's not that good.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.680
But I can play in like 2K pretty well.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.200
So that was fun.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.400
So, you know, Portal's a standby old favorite.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.400
I'm glad they're still making that game look good

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.640
all these years later.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.280
I wish they would just do a three, but okay.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.920
Put a fresh coat of paint on the classics.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.960
At least I didn't have to pay anything for it either.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.200
It was something that was just included

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.320
because I own the original Portal.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.160
So that was nice.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.520
So, s2100matt in chat says,

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.440
my gaming week was MagFest.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.480
I'm so curious how that was this year.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.520
You'll have to tell me more about how MagFest went.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.800
I'm curious if you were there too while they are.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.200
Maybe you didn't go this year

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.920
because I know you have your daughter and all that yet now.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.280
I don't know if you still go to MagFest,

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.000
but I'd be super, super curious

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.680
how that was for those that went.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.800
So, oh, he posted a bunch of pics and vids

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.560
in a thread in our conventions channel on Discord.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.000
I did see some of the pics,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.440
but I didn't see all of the videos.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.280
Hold on, hold on.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.960
Let me, we'll do it live.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.800
Let me do this.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.960
I'm going to go here and I'm going to go to conventions

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.920
and oh, we're not seeing anything.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.760
I'm sorry.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.740
Let me try to figure out what's going on over here.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.600
Sorry, folks.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.820
Oh, I think this is because of the update they just did.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.660
There we go.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.900
Okay, yeah, this is interesting.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.680
So they have some actual machines that are there.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.100
Yeah, I did see some of these.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.820
So I saw that there's like plenty of sound

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.820
Voltex machines that they have set up and said,

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.220
wow, like three Step Maniacs cabs.

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.420
So they were set for the music game fans.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.580
Ooh, there's some Pokken for.

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.700
I just got one of those nearby too.

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.420
They opened up a brand new arcade here

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.860
in the Folsom outlets

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.620
and they've got a Step Maniacs there

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.660
in the groove three, totally legit.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:18.140
Do you know why that arcade is totally loaded?

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.260
It's probably either from the Rockland one

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.140
or from the drive-in, I'm guessing.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.420
It is the same guy who stocked the Rockland one

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.820
in the drive-in that actually runs that arcade.

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:29.260
So that arcade is gonna be a hotspot.

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.100
Oh, neat.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.500
Someone doing a speed run of Portal

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.640
with Ellen McClain doing commentary.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.940
That's pretty awesome.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:35.780
Bye.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.620
That's awesome.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.940
I do actually have some other local news.

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.100
Oh yeah, what's that?

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.780
The game room is having a new arcade director.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.740
Oh, really?

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.520
That's all I know about it,

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.380
but apparently Joe is gone.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.220
Interesting.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:58.560
But yeah, I was gonna say, speaking of Ellen McClain,

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.780
I was really taken with how much GLaDOS inspiration

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.900
there was in Megan.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.140
That was pretty impressive, for sure.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.780
Let's see, some indie arcade games.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.260
I'm not gonna go through all of these videos,

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.540
especially live.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.160
Typing party arcade game.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.140
This is a rock, paper, scissor game

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.140
where you have to protect your fort

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.360
from flying rock, paper, and scissors.

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.300
What is this?

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.600
Typing party.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.760
This looks kind of fun.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.740
I'm waiting for the actual action to happen.

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.060
Oh, here we go.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.700
Oh, so you're actually typing the word

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.520
that goes with the rock, paper, scissor.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.380
Oh, that's clever.

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.300
So it's like you're on two sides

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.820
and they're throwing things at each other

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.780
using the rock, paper, scissors mechanic.

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.660
All right, that's clever.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.540
I like that.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.860
Thank you for that video.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:53.040
And let's see, Pin City.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:53.880
What was the one?

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.700
You said something in chat.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.780
Oh, a pinball walkthrough for dark soccer, I guess.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.660
And any pinball fan out there.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.240
It is hard to make out some of these machines,

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.620
but I see a Godzilla.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.340
There we go, the lighting kicked in there.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.180
Okay.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.180
So it's-

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.300
Did you play Weird Al?

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.780
Was there a Weird Al?

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.460
Oh yeah, was there a Weird Al?

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.500
If Stern had a presence there,

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.980
not Stern, but a P3.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.540
Anyway, thank you for the videos.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.420
It looks like the gaming area is still hopping.

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.140
Oh God, you'll have to go

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.340
because he sent like seven pinball videos.

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.880
Unfortunately, I can't play them all live,

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.220
but yeah, wow, it looks like it was hopping over there.

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.140
Holy goodness, like BeatMania machines

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.600
right up next to each other, like several of them.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.660
Yeah, it looks like Magfest was pretty off the hook.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.080
There's a lot of interesting collectibles in there too.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:42.920
All right.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.160
If you want to go through the channel later on,

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.720
and I suggest you do, head on over to our Discord channel,

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.260
vognetwork.com slash Discord,

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.840
and you can actually look for that thread

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.920
in the conventions channel.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.960
There's a thread, you kind of hover over it

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.860
and you can see Magfest 2023 photos, videos.

01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:01.800
Thank you, Matt, for uploading that.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.760
Really appreciate that.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.360
And by the way, since we didn't have an OLR last week,

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.240
may I say congratulations and mazel tov, Matt,

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.880
on your engagement, because that happened.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.320
So thank you for, that reminded me to say that

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.720
because we weren't here last week, so.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.280
And s2100matt says, no Weird Al, sadly.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.640
Lexi Light Speed was a pretty cool newer to me table, so.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.440
Lexi Light Speed is a pretty fun one, I have to admit.

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.780
I had a lot of fun with that one.

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.320
There's some others that I don't like,

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.280
but my top two, Weird Al is at the top

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.380
and then Lexi Light Speed.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.240
Dr. Studio says, yeah, I'm sad we don't have any cons

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.580
like that near us outside San Diego Comic-Con,

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.260
but that's a bit out of our price range.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.760
They used to have a big one.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.180
I don't think it was Barstow, maybe it was Riverside,

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.820
but it was somewhere out in Inland Empire.

01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:52.540
They had like a big, but they liquidated that whole thing.

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.380
Remember that?

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.200
It was somebody who brought it up on the show

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.580
that they were kind of keeping an eye on that

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:57.900
as that was liquidating.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.820
But yeah, probably the closest thing you have right now

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.840
is California Extreme, that I know of.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.440
I'm sure Southern California must have

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.740
some arcade collectible community there

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.820
that maybe we just don't know where the show is yet.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.180
But anyway, we got to move on.

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:13.220
We got to get into the news this week.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.860
There still are a few things that happened,

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:16.780
so let's get into it.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:21.620
Some pretty big news headlines to kick off 2023, right, Loki?

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.740
Yep, there's actually things this week.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:30.200
So first off, we've got another studio that is unionizing.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.580
So the Blizzard studio that has worked on, I guess,

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.140
the World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight.

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:44.660
It's Proletariat announced that they're, I guess,

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.420
planning on unionizing on.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.980
They announced that on Tuesday.

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:51.760
And they have 60 employees.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:57.820
So they have the new Proletariat Workers Alliance

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.860
and is unionizing with the Communications

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.980
Workers of America.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:06.240
And they said they have a super majority of support

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.440
among their qualifying staff at the studio.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:14.840
And let's see what their vision statement says here,

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.940
what they're looking for.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.920
They said, let's see, they want to fight

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.800
to ensure there are progressive human-first benefits

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.280
such as flexible PTO policy, remote work

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.780
as a permanent option, and robust health care,

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:32.560
open and transparent communication over compensation,

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.360
and pushing to pay employees a thriving wage,

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.200
clear, equitable, and actionable processes

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.760
and resources for workers to attain their career

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.080
goals such as professional development,

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.280
pass to promotion, and raises.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.600
Overtime is never mandatory.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.600
And refusing doesn't affect performance evaluations.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.300
Transparent process by which management and workers

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:58.840
can hold each other accountable without fear of retaliation.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.480
And a culture and policies prioritize DEI

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.200
in every level of decision making

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.920
and support underrepresented groups

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.760
so that we can build the most diverse and equitable AAA game

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.520
studio in the country.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520
Cool.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.920
And apparently, there hasn't been any pushback on it

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.440
so far, so.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.680
There won't be for Microsoft.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.440
They've made it pretty well known.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.960
Well, not Microsoft, but you know.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.080
Oh, regulatory, right.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.840
Well, Activision Blizzard, you know, doing their busting.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.920
They have no choice.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.240
And they know it.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.400
This is where it's going, you know.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.000
And because if they were to push back,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.840
it could fuck their whole deal with Microsoft.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.880
They can't.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.840
So it is what I think.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.840
And this is going to be the first of many you

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.440
see this coming year, that's for sure.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.880
Yeah, I think I'm surprised it's so few so far,

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.160
but it's just momentum.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.840
Once you see more studios going this route,

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.960
then more will follow.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.240
Yep.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.080
All right, well, moving on to our next story.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.520
It is the first week of the year,

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.560
first full week of the year.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.280
And that means, of course, Awesome Games Done Quick

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:04.760
is back.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.440
And Awesome Games Done Quick is doing their 2023 speed run

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.040
marathon.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.960
They're going to be debuting some new speed runs this year,

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.360
including Stray, Splatoon 3.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.560
Of course, a lot of these games just came out, right?

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.720
Powerwash Simulator, that's going to be interesting.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.080
And Neon White, yeah, are all debuting this year.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.200
So that's pretty cool.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.800
The event runs from today, the 8th, through January 15th.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.800
This is all online.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.280
You may or may not remember, originally,

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.840
AGDQ was being looked at for Florida

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.120
as they had done in the past.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.640
And that was the trend in the past.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.320
But when Summer Games Done Quick was in person

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.560
in the Mall of America town in Minnesota,

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.680
when they did Summer Games Done Quick there,

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.760
they were taking COVID precautions very seriously,

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.240
probably to a further extent than you have probably

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.200
seen probably any other convention at this point do.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.120
If you want to go to Bobby Black Wolf's show

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.760
because he's involved with Games Done Quick

01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.640
with the commentating.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.280
And he went, go look for his episode

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.520
that goes into all the details about how far their COVID

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.360
procedures went.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.920
But you know what?

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.120
They worked.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.800
You know what you didn't hear from Games Done Quick?

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.880
Any COVID transmission.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.720
You didn't hear it.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.520
So precautions worked.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.960
So they took precautions.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.040
So there is that.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.880
And it does seem like Florida was not

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.160
going to allow them, essentially.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.600
Long story short, I'm making a long story very, very short.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.360
But basically, Florida was not a safe place

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.560
to have Games Done Quick between their options for COVID

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.240
and, of course, not just that, but you

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.120
look at Florida's governor and a lot of the holy crusades

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.840
he's decided to go on recently.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.200
And it's not a safe place for people in other ways.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.240
So Games Done Quick, the virtual thing worked.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.280
So let's do that.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.320
So they're going to do the virtual awesome Games Done

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.200
Quick.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.680
Anyway, some other runs.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.600
Cult of the Lamb, they're going to speed run as well.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.560
That's interesting.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.600
So that's pretty cool.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.320
It'd be too hard.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.360
Yeah.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.760
Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge, Tiger Claw.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.720
I'm sure you're going to be watching that.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.000
No Elden Ring, unless they're saying perhaps it's a bonus

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
game, but I don't think that was on the schedule.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.840
But that's OK, because they mix it up.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.160
Of course, AGDQ is raising money for the Prevent Cancer

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.640
Foundation.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.640
2022 raised $3.4 million.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.960
And yeah, they've raised over $41 million

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.800
for charity since 2010.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.320
That is very, very cool.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.440
Bobby Blackwolf in Chat says, fun fact.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.440
Unlike previous events, bits and subs on their Twitch channel

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.040
do not go to charity, but go toward paying the hotel

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.320
cancellation fees.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.280
Wow.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.240
So it shows you how serious they were about this whole thing.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.760
So I mean, it's a bummer.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.280
You know what?

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.000
But in a way, the optics of that make

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.960
it look like the hotel is taking the charity's money.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.560
And so it is kind of a smart move by the Game Stunt

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.960
Quick organization, to be honest.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.960
Because the hotel could have opted to just let it go.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.360
But I guess I understand there's employees and things

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.320
like that that they've got to pay.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.040
So there's got to be a middle road somewhere.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:10.760
Interesting.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.600
As Jordan heard Matt talking about MAGFest,

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.320
since we're talking about COVID precautions,

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.040
what does that look like in 2023?

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.880
MAGFest took precautions very seriously as well this year.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.760
Everyone had to be vaxed to masks at all times to enter.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.240
And for the most part, everyone followed procedure very well

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.600
with mild grumbling.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:26.960
Interesting.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.600
Very interesting.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.800
By the way, speaking of our pal Bobby Black Wolf,

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.840
I do want to give a shout out.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.720
Because as I mentioned, he does commentating for Game Stunt

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.400
Quick and has for a few years now,

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.080
ever since they went virtual.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.920
Or at least, if not the first one,

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.800
the one right after that.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.840
He's been doing it for a while.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.080
And he will be participating with this one as well.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.040
If you want to tune in, I don't know how he's going to do it.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.560
Because he's going to be back awake.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.440
His first shift is coming up overnight.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.560
So probably by the time most of you have heard this podcast,

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.960
you've probably already missed his first shift

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.560
that took place at 3 o'clock in the morning West Coast time,

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.320
or 6 o'clock in the morning Eastern.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.560
But he'll be commentating for Gun Grave,

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.720
Armored Core Project Phantasma,

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.680
Bomberman 64, The Second Attack, and Onimusha 2.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.440
Those runs are happening overnight tonight.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.200
Well, overnight for us on the West Coast.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:18.400
But this is a great opportunity for you VOG Network folks

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.280
in Europe.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.280
This is very well timed for you.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.840
Or even places like Japan and Australia.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.600
This is a weird time of the clock for us in the States.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.160
But it's a very good time of the clock for those of you

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:32.880
in other countries.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.200
So if you ever want to hear Bobby Blackwolf do his thing,

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.640
you get a chance this year.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.400
The one you'll probably have a better chance

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.640
of catching Bobby at will be Thursday

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.560
at 3.30 in the morning our time,

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.240
6.30 in the morning East Coast time.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.760
He's going to be closing out the awful block

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.440
with bad guys at school.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.240
And Steven Seagal is the final option.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.080
Oh, geez.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.120
Which apparently has a lot of lulls behind it.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.600
So that's why that's the one that's closing out the block.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.480
And then he also gets to do a Mega Man ZX speedrun

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.960
as they transition back into the less awful games

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.040
part of the show there.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.600
And that is all overnight for us on Thursday.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.520
But again, for Europe, that's what?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.320
Add five hours.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.840
That's practically noon time.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:14.400
He'll probably be.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.160
I mean, there's always delays and things like that,

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.160
but practically noon time for folks in GMT.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.080
So pretty cool.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.360
Good luck, Bobby.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.200
All right, let us move on.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.880
Darsakha, you hinted at this earlier.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:30.560
Yeah.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:35.840
So now people weren't really believing it at first

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.480
until DBD leaks put out something.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.760
And DBD leaks for anyone who follows Dead by Daylight,

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.760
they are some of the most reliable people for any news

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.560
about what's going to be going on in Dead by Daylight.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.440
They've shown outfits before they're released.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.600
They've given, you know, like the advent calendar.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.360
I think they knew it before it was released,

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.240
all of this business.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:12.480
So the PTB, the public test beta files are out

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.320
and people, of course, data miners

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.760
are going to look for whatever they can.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.920
So they were finding that his three perks,

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.080
which I mean, they're very specific names.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.200
It's what Franklin's demise, barbecue and chili,

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.600
and why can't I think of the other one?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.000
Knockout.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.880
Yeah, the one I don't use.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.480
But I mean, but two of them specifically

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.160
are named after, you know, things important to the movie.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:49.280
So there are now, there were screenshots floating around

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.680
of it saying like, I have to find a picture for it again,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.040
but it's like replacement, barbecue and chili, blah, blah,

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.880
blah, rare perk.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.040
Whereas if it's specific to a character,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.760
it would say like rare, the cannibal perk.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.760
I am going to point out those saying

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.160
that the stranger things characters,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.080
even though their perks were changed,

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.400
it still has, for me at least, Demogorgon perk,

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.400
Nancy perk, you know, stuff like that,

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.160
even though they are supposed to be generics

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.680
and act like generics.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.880
But that's the rumor of what's going on with Bubba's perks.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.440
What that means is that the theory

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.000
is that behavior is going to be losing the license

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.320
which as I recall, isn't it,

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.600
wasn't that their first licensed character was Bubba?

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.200
Myers was, then they got Bubba.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.040
Myers was, that's right, Myers was.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.960
But at any rate, you know,

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.240
but this is the character that inspired the game.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.640
I mean, the whole meat hook thing,

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.040
that came from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.240
I mean, they even had a character based off of Leatherface,

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.120
you know, the hillbilly who ran around with a chainsaw

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.360
and, you know, grunted a lot.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.720
Now, the other thing that gives a little bit more evidence

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:22.480
to this is that in pulling the actual data for it,

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.920
they have also that they're listed as Perk Barbecue Chili

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.440
underscore name underscore alt.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.520
So that's indicating that particular piece of change.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.200
There is, hold on, it's going to be one other thing.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.880
I've got to find my other resource

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.400
because I forgot to link it to you.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.880
It's actually this, I don't want to play the YouTube video,

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.640
but it's got the screenshot that I need in it.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:56.640
It's one of the videos I follow,

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.960
and he's been completely full of crap before,

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.080
but is Mint Skull.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.440
There is, he had a screenshot also

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.040
of some of the code for the licensed characters.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:17.120
And the piece of the code for the licensed character

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.480
is that next to leather faces, it says license expire true.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.320
And if you look at other licensed characters,

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.360
like they checked ash.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.000
Next to ash, it was license expire false.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:41.440
So in the end, they're probably going to end up doing with Bubba

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.960
what they did, what they're doing with the stranger things.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.200
The stranger things content,

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.720
where the character is going to be removed for purchase.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.840
He will still be in the game,

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.840
but if you have not already purchased him

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.520
and all of his cosmetics,

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.640
you will not be able to get him again.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.360
And the going theory is that it's due to the,

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.840
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game that's coming out.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.840
I mean, that was sort of what happened

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.800
with Stranger Things content.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.840
Although, I mean, the rumors have been floating around

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.440
about Stranger Things coming back,

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.040
but some of that was disproven.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.320
I was going to say that's the one thing

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.800
that DBD Leaks thus far has gotten wrong

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.760
is the DBD Leaks was on this Vecna.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.640
There was reason to believe it,

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.200
but those ended up being fan-made renders.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.120
Oh, cause I was gonna say, to be fair,

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.600
and it looked legit.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.520
It could be the next DLC

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.120
because they were saying it was going to be

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.640
around the time the night came out,

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.080
but it could just be as simple as

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.880
Behavior didn't want to do two licenses back to back

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.160
cause they had just done Resident Evil.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.120
And I don't think they've ever done

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.240
two licenses back to back.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.440
So it could just, you know,

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.880
there's a lot of things that could happen,

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.800
but it could be that the Stranger Things happened

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800
just comes back with Vecna.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.280
And I think they were saying Joyce would be at all

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.240
for Nancy or whatever.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:10.480
I don't know.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.760
It could be all fan-wank, who knows,

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.600
but that that would all hit the game in the next.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.720
We get the cop guy, who I can never remember his name.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.960
Oh, Dommer.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.320
We could give him him and Joyce.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.360
That would be cool.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.160
It would be cool,

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:24.720
but I think that,

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.720
weren't they saying Eddie for the male killer?

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.680
Or not male, I'm sorry.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:28.800
Male survivor would be Eddie.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.000
Maybe.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:30.720
Maybe.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:31.840
We need Barb back.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.520
But Hopper, thank you.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.920
Why would they say Dommer?

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.720
You know what though?

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.800
Is it like if they did bring it back,

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.240
would they bring back Hawkins?

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.200
So I need to go load up my Windows partition

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.200
so that I can rip the content

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.920
and see if the Hawkins map is still,

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.520
because all up until a couple of PTBs ago,

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.560
at least to my knowledge,

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.640
because I haven't gone for files since then,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.160
the maps and assets for Hawkins

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.920
was still in the game files.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:05.920
Of course, also.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:07.840
Oh, I was just to say,

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.240
I do want to point out,

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.840
because you had also pointed this out to me

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.400
and I did go,

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.040
Oh yeah.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:13.760
Is that, you know,

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.520
with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game,

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.000
you know,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.840
it makes a lot of sense why this is happening.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.440
Stranger Things games,

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.080
those,

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.360
I think at this point,

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.960
they were probably making more money

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.400
from the Dead by Daylight thing

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.920
than they were from those Stranger Things games.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.920
So Netflix is probably come around on that finally.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.520
But you did make a good point.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.240
You said when the Evil Dead game came out,

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.200
they didn't pull Ash.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.000
Because Bruce Campbell likes money.

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.440
I mean,

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.600
I'm going to be flat out about this.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.880
That's true.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.720
Back when I saw The Man with the Screaming Brain,

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.840
which was a really crappy movie he was in,

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.360
he was there at the Crest.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320
And he was like,

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:56.640
yeah,

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.200
this movie here paid for my roof.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.600
This movie here got my kids braces,

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:02.720
you know,

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.800
and I was like,

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:05.520
I was like,

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.840
I don't see Bruce Campbell

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.760
not allowing his likeness to be used

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.640
for anything related to Ash.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:17.280
So that's just Bruce.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.400
That's just,

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:19.680
yeah,

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:20.080
you know,

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:20.880
Bruce Campbell.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.720
He likes money.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.200
And I think it could be a timing thing, too,

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.400
is that these license agreements

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.120
are probably locked in for about five years.

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.160
And we're probably past the five years.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.080
And now you have this Texas Chainsaw Massacre game

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:34.480
coming out.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.360
It doesn't add up good.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.000
It was probably less for Stranger Things

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.400
because, you know,

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.920
it's got different kind of IP.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.400
But I don't think Ash has been in the game

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.880
more than two years at this point.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.840
So probably even isn't playing then.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.000
Yeah.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.600
Even if Evil Dead was coming out

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.400
is probably one of those things

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.680
where they were locked into contracts

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.240
still anyway.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:52.880
So who knows?

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.280
Locopoco in chat says it's sad

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.480
that the license is going to go away,

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.240
but the license stuff was never guaranteed

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.320
to stay forever as much as we wanted it.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.680
When DVD came to Switch,

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.920
they had to renegotiate Freddy's chapter

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.280
because it wasn't available with it

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.000
when it released.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:06.720
That's a good point.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.760
I didn't realize that.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.400
You know what I would like to see, though,

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.000
like as a surprise?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.200
I would like to see a classic Freddy chapter.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.320
Oh, yeah.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.520
Where we where we get like,

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.680
like, say, we get Elm Street as a map,

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.720
you know, with the house

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.600
in the center intact and everything,

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.680
kind of like the Myers house.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.960
I mean, that would be too many things

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.000
that are exactly the same.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Or we have something like Hawkins.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.240
You could easily translate the Hawkins map

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.040
into a big boiler room, you know?

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.200
Yes to all of that.

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.280
But literally just Nancy is enough.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.880
Like, literally just Nancy

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.880
would make so many people happy.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.560
If they did bring out Nancy, though,

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.200
I would also want Alice.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Sorry, I'm team Alice in this.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.040
Fair enough.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.200
Um, but yeah, I and you know,

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.400
there's, you know,

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.760
I watched some of those YouTubes

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.040
you sent me a little later,

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.240
and some person was kind of going off

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.600
about how the loss of this license

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.360
is so devastating because it kind of ruins.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:09.840
Oh, yeah.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.480
That was the multiple video, right?

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.840
I don't know the whole.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.040
It's interesting how people make

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.480
five minute YouTube videos out of two.

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.600
But here we are with the three hour

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.560
podcasts or whatever.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.000
So Turnabout's fair play.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.360
So it's just how how horrible

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.320
it was going to be for the whole,

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.160
like multiverse of horror thing.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.120
And I'm kind of like,

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.520
look, the game still doesn't have Jason.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.920
So it's not like it really has everything.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.520
And I kind of I kind of think

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.560
if DBD ever gets Jason,

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.320
that's the note you go out on.

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.400
Like, we got them all there.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.000
There ain't no more done.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.280
You know, even though

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.480
as long as that game prints money,

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.920
they're still going to keep making DLC for it.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.600
But I feel like once you have Jason,

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.320
because the Friday the 13th game

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.000
has got to be over five years old at this point.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.120
So I have no idea

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.240
where those licenses sit.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.360
I know it's messy.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.120
But heaven forbid they can work that out.

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.480
Jason coming to Dead by Daylight

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.160
would be fucking huge, to put it lightly.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.960
And that's it.

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.120
You don't you don't get any bigger license

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.400
for DBD than Jason.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.760
And that's the note you go out on,

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.400
to be honest.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.720
Would like to see Jason in the game,

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.640
you know, which honestly,

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:23.840
Trapper in my esteem is the

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.400
the answer to Jason.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.200
Yeah, be a mask cleaver,

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:30.000
that kind of stuff.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.040
So, yeah, we'll see.

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:35.280
All right.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:35.680
We'll see.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.200
All right.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.000
Well, moving on.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.240
One place you can play Dead by Daylight

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.000
is on your PlayStation.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.880
And Sony had a lot to say at CES.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.560
We have yet to say it during the show,

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.880
but Consumer Electronics Show was this week.

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.480
And usually the CES is more for

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.240
literally consumer electronics.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.720
E3 was kind of spun off from CES

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:57.920
to be specifically about,

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.160
you know, electronic entertainment.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.640
CES is like new TVs.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.520
Megan dolls would fit in really great at CES.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.680
Arcade 1up usually announces things at CES.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:08.640
We'll get to that in a minute.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.840
But Sony sometimes does things at CES

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.720
because remember all the other crap Sony does.

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.320
And I say that would love all the other crap,

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.040
like TVs, sound, movies.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.680
You know, Sony does get into consumer electronics.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.320
Yes.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.160
So they had some things to say at CES.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:24.720
Right, Loki?

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:25.600
Yeah.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.920
They talked a little bit about PlayStation

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.520
and announced a few things.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.520
So one of the things that they announced

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.520
is a brand new controller.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.600
That's this Project Leonardo.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.560
And it is almost it's similar

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.160
to the adaptive controller

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.720
that Microsoft put out of.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.160
Well, now it's like four years ago.

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:51.280
It looks like two spherical portions

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.480
of a controller with different buttons on each one.

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.320
Or I should say they're almost like paddles.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.440
They're really large and slightly customizable.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.320
I got to say, though,

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.920
it doesn't look as customizable

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.440
as the adaptive controller like that.

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:08.160
You could really do like any possible thing you want with.

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.320
This looks a little bit more constrained,

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:13.920
but at least it's a step in the right direction

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.520
to add some more accessibility to the PlayStation 5.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.560
And I'm not sure where it's going to be coming out

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.520
or when it's coming out for how much or whatever,

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.480
but it is something at least that they showed off.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.200
So that's cool.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.520
That's something in the right direction.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.280
Also announced that the PlayStation 5

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.000
is surpassed 30 million units sold,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.880
which is surprising considering we couldn't get one

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.480
and they were sold out everywhere.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.800
So I guess they're moving units.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.000
So that's good.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.120
OK, but Loki, the lie detector test

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.800
on where to get those units.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.600
I don't know about that.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.080
Yeah, well, they're saying that it's going to be

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:03.520
readily available this year.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.960
We'll see if that actually ends up happening.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:11.040
But because they've had unprecedented demand,

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.120
they say for the console in the last two years,

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.600
that's why it sold so many.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.960
And this is globally, of course.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.000
Let's see.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.320
So PlayStation 5's in stock.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:20.880
Let's see.

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.600
Not there, not there, not there, not there, not there.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.600
Gee, I can't find one within 50 miles of here at a target.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.920
So I'm going to say that was a lie.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.520
Well, yeah, they're saying that's going to be this year.

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:38.080
So I'm assuming that you got to give them

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.280
a little bit of time here.

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.880
But they've basically in December,

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.280
they said that they've resolved their supply issues

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.880
in Asian territories.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.800
But yet I don't know if it's necessarily overcome

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.840
that everywhere else.

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.000
So we'll have to wait and see.

01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.320
But that's what they're saying.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.480
I mean, they can always they could say that now.

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:03.280
And then three months from now, they could just be like,

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:07.440
oh, yeah, well, whoops, we I guess we're just so popular

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:11.280
that I just sold out, you know, so we'll just spin it that way.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.880
All right, well, back to the good news

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.720
about the accessibility controller.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.280
As to 100 Matt says, I'm so glad that Sony partnered

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.920
with a lot of organizations, including able gamers,

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.720
making games more accessible for everyone makes gaming

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.560
better and more gamers.

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.520
Yes, to all of that.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.960
That is a very good announcement out of consumer electronic

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.840
show for sure.

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.880
The other part of what they said to be determined,

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.520
but I'm not sure I believe him yet.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:36.160
But we'll see.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:36.560
We'll see.

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:38.560
They sure seem confident what they're saying.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.840
And again, I don't I don't see how the PlayStation VR 2

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.680
can sell a lot of units if there's not a lot of,

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.200
units out there.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.320
But anyway, moving on, let's talk about some news

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:50.240
from arcade one up out of CES.

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.760
As I mentioned, they tend to show new machines and so forth

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.320
at consumer electronic show, and a little bit out of left

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.440
field for their new machine.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.080
Their new machine they announced is a Wheel of Fortune

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.040
casino Cade.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.720
So a lot of us, you know, the collect the classic arcade

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:08.640
machines kind of look at that and go, huh, what, why?

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.440
But let's be real.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.400
It is a market that is untapped yet.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.000
And there would be fans of casino games and yet they exist

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.800
that would be interested in this kind of thing when they

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.640
may not be as interested in a Tron or a Burger Time machine

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.200
or whatever, you know, arcade one up you can think of.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.840
So it is expanding there are attempting to expand their

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:30.640
audience.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.680
So it's interesting.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:34.400
But certainly I look at a Wheel of Fortune arcade one up

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.520
and I go not for me.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.960
But you know, the sights and sounds of casino.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.280
I have a friend that's very interested in collecting these

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.760
types of casino collectibles, because that's what he likes.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.360
And so there are people that do enjoy the fake casino

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:51.760
experience.

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:57.520
I mean, would they keep making poker, blackjack slot machine

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:01.120
games for Android and iOS if people weren't eating them up?

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.920
So there's a lot of people that like the fake casino stuff.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.240
So a lot of people like the real stuff too.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.600
But there's a market for this.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.040
I just don't think it's any of us.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.080
But there's that.

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.840
However, maybe a little more up our alley, the arcade one up

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.360
infinity game board.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.880
So that's, it's basically like a giant tablet, but a little

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.520
more firm, you know, a little more for game night that, you

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:25.680
know, you can play like a virtual Uno and things like that

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:26.180
on.

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.440
But as far as like the machine collectibles, they're going

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.280
to be doing some more deluxe machines.

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.280
So those are the full size arcade machines.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.720
They did Killer Instinct, I think was the big one at CES

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.440
last year.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.760
So they're even bigger than the ones behind me because

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:42.320
technically these are three quarters size on a riser.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:47.120
So the deluxe ones are like true original arcade size.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.160
So there's going to be a Mortal Kombat deluxe with Mortal

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:52.080
Kombat 2 branding all over it.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.880
But that includes most of the Midway stuff from the 80s or

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.560
90s, 80s around that era.

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.960
There's also going to be a Pac-Man deluxe, which is basically

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.680
your Namco greatest hits, you know, your Mappy and so forth.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.000
There's also going to be a Ms.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.280
Pac-Man deluxe.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.480
So they've got those rights issues sorted out where Ms.

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.080
Pac-Man and Pac-Man are both available.

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.720
And a class of 81 deluxe, which is the one that split on

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.280
how it looks.

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.000
It's got Ms.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.400
Pac-Man and Galaga in it as there was a famous arcade machine

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.120
called Class of 81 that was just like that.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.240
It had him split there.

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.760
So, yeah, it's funny.

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:31.440
Like I read that wrong at first and I thought it had 81 games

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.760
and I'm like, dang, the friendly stepping up.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:34.800
No, no, no.

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:38.000
In fact, I think Class of 81 deluxe might literally only

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.120
have those two games.

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.480
I don't think it has much more, but the other ones are.

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.280
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.320
I stand corrected.

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.960
12 games in Class of 81, but I don't see a list, at least

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.480
not readily available for me to grab.

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.800
But generally these things tend to be like a best of, you

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.200
know, Namco type of thing.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.440
You know, whoever the company is on there.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.840
So looking in chat.

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.520
Orange Riot is talking about the casino going, my parents

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.920
love the fake slot machine games on Facebook.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:08.480
Yeah.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.600
And the interesting thing is, I mean, I don't know how recently

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.880
any of you have been to a casino, but if you think casinos

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.560
now are still pull the lever and that whole thing.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.240
Like, yeah, those games are still there, but that is not

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.280
the majority of games.

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:25.680
The majority of casino slot machine games now are like

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.160
touch screen type of things where all the slots are there.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.480
And then the bonus round is a touch game.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.640
And that's what they're going for with this Wheel of Fortune

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.120
thing, because they're kind of trying to gamify something

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.400
that's a little harder to gamify, because I think they're

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.160
actually putting puzzles in it, which don't exist in the

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.760
actual Wheel of Fortune slot machine.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.760
But okay, whatever.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:46.260
So.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.280
Oh, thank you.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:51.520
Orange Riot says the 12 games in the Class of 81 are Ms.

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:56.320
Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaga 88, Galaxian, Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2,

01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.400
Mappy, Rally X, Rolling Thunder, Rompers, Tower of Draga,

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.520
King and Balloon.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.880
See, those games have all been in before, except I think

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.560
Rompers and King and Balloon.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.760
I think now they're digging deeper, which it's weird that

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:15.520
they don't do things like, what the fuck was the dragon game

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.680
that was in every Namco collection?

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.160
Oh, my God, you're riding on the backs of dragons.

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:22.960
It's a shooting game.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.200
Why am I completely blanking right now?

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.160
Dragon Spirit.

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:29.760
Yeah, Dragon Spirit.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.320
I beat chat.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.200
I beat chat.

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:32.080
I beat it.

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.320
Dragon Spirit delay, delay.

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.480
But I'm kind of surprised I'm not putting stuff like that

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:38.960
in there.

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:39.360
So, yeah.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.720
And Fenaris is Joust.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.000
Joust isn't Namco, but I believe Joust is on that Mortal

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Combat Cabinet, because that's in the classic Midway.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.440
So, oh, sorry.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.480
Rama's right.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.000
You're not riding on the back of the dragon.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.040
You are the dragon.

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.840
See, I got it mixed up with the Dreamcast thing.

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:59.520
But anyway, I know I'm literally firing myself.

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.360
All right, moving on.

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:02.880
Where are we at?

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.120
Are we?

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.080
Who has this next story?

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.120
Is it me?

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.760
Oh, I missed a story in the sidebar.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.840
So I was like, what is wrong here?

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.320
Yes.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.800
Dark Soccer, you're actually next with a story that is not

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.600
on our sidebar.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.160
Sorry about that.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:21.620
Oh.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:23.920
User error.

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.160
Oh, gosh.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:25.940
Yeah.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.120
And I was so focused on Debbie.

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.360
So at any rate, Atari is announcing a new handheld,

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.680
a mini arcade in-home console.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.640
It looks weird and kind of retro.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.680
It's the Atari and My Arcade releasing

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.760
these three collaborations.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.720
So we have the My Arcade Atari Micro Player,

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:55.760
which looks like a desktop, a tabletop arcade cabinet.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:04.720
And then we have the My Arcade Atari Pocket Player,

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.480
little handheld dedicated.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.640
I mean, you've seen the My Arcades at the store.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.840
They have a lot of them like that.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.340
Yeah.

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.440
Well, no, I'm talking about the little personal

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.560
handheld gameplay.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.360
Those I don't have.

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.560
I have the little arcade replicas, but yeah.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:19.060
Yeah.

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.400
And I've got a bunch of those too,

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.440
at least the ones that are good.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:27.280
And then the last one is the My Arcade Atari Game Station Plus

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.240
that actually reminds me in coloration of the Atari 7800

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:39.360
and a little sort of retro futuristic looking joysticks

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.520
that have extra buttons and twisties on them.

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.440
So, and they did clarify that it will include a collection

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.680
of games from the 2600, 7800 and the arcade.

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.200
What about the 5200?

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.560
The best games are the 50.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:55.120
Fuck them.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:55.680
No, I'm just kidding.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.060
I'm pissed.

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.560
But at any rate.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.720
It looks better than a flashback does.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.960
It's a nice looking thing.

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.720
So we'll see what they're like when they come out.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.720
I'll reserve some judgment.

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.880
Better this than that VCS computer or whatever the hell

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.480
they were trying two years ago.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.600
It was silly.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.160
Yeah.

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:18.660
Right.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:20.400
All right.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.160
Now that my brain is back on track,

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.760
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.220
Yes.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
So it's kind of cool.

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.560
We've got this story.

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.280
We talked about this, I think a little bit ago where there

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.640
was a DMCA takedown of Did You Know Gaming's video on the

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.200
Heroes of Hyrule, which was a work in progress game that

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.200
never made it to the DS.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.360
But it was supposed to be coming out on the Nintendo DS,

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.120
kind of a tactics Zelda game.

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.320
And it was taken down by, I think, Nintendo themselves.

01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:02.080
But they have, I guess, worked with or fought against it

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:08.720
with YouTube, and now it has been able to be put back up.

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:11.040
They were able to win their case, I guess.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.360
So that's cool.

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.240
And we get to actually see some information about this

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.320
unpublished game that Nintendo, I guess, didn't want us

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:20.820
knowing about.

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.800
The only thing that irritates me about all of this is that

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.840
thank you, Madeline.

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.280
Sorry, off screen.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.040
Nice husband bringing me a drink.

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.520
So the only thing that is disappointing about this is that

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.880
Nintendo ought to get a strike.

01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:37.040
That's the way this should work.

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:41.200
These companies claim things that there isn't their right

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:41.840
to claim.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.040
They should get a strike.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.440
But that's not how YouTube is set up, unfortunately.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:46.660
Right.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.800
Basically, they did a DMCA takedown.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.760
He counter noticed.

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:56.240
So if they said countered again, then they would get a

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:59.840
strike on the channel, and they would have to go to court

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.340
over this.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.000
But they never, I guess, responded.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.140
So.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.960
And Nintendo, you do not want that court case.

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.320
I mean, I know Nintendo is a big, scary company, but this

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.360
is the type of thing, this video, and maybe Nintendo could

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.480
read the tea leaves on this.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.320
This is the type of thing that catches fire on Reddit.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:24.080
And some fucking lawyer goes, I'll do it pro bono to stick

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.280
it in Nintendo on this.

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.880
And this is the type of thing that just Nintendo doesn't

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:29.360
want this.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.960
It was a mistake for them to do this in the first place.

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.360
And maybe this is their way of quietly admitting that.

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.520
But Nintendo is smart to not pursue this any further.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:40.960
Exactly.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.760
Because it's not like it was a project that they're working

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.520
on right now, as far as we're aware.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:49.200
It's not something that they would be embarrassed by.

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.760
It's just something that they never made.

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.360
They decided not to go with it.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.080
Well, and there's so much precedent out there where it's

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.680
like, we've seen documentaries about movies that were not

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:04.240
made, lost TV pilots that were never meant to actually be

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.840
on air that, you know, end up getting like the whole, like,

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.040
documentary of things that didn't happen, especially after

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.480
a certain statute of limitations.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.120
Like, again, it's not like this game was scheduled to come

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:15.840
out this year.

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.960
It was supposed to come out in the DS era, right?

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:22.720
So like, like, damn near 20 years ago, at least 15 years

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.520
ago. So it's like, it's not worth it to Nintendo to fight

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:30.560
this. And, you know, then, of course, the internet is quick

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.040
to label everything Streisand effect these days.

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.280
But in part, yes, I guarantee you now more people have seen

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:38.160
that documentary.

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.400
Nintendo ultimately lost this.

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:46.960
More people saw that documentary because gaming, journalism,

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:51.440
social media all put that YouTube link this week in announcing

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.000
that it's back.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.320
That's all these hits now.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.160
There it is.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.360
Tiger class says, remember Star Fox 2, a game that was never

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.760
supposed to be released, but eventually did get released.

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.520
Well, yes, that's a little different because Nintendo kind

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.960
of put that out themselves.

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.720
So it's not really like, but I mean, maybe I could read into

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:15.920
that is that maybe Nintendo wanted to do a DS classic someday

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.160
and put the canceled Zelda game in it.

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.920
And maybe they're a little worried about that.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:23.760
I mean, that's the only thing where you might be able to

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.920
go. Oh, that's why they did it.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.760
But again, I think they did more damage to their cause because

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.920
now everybody's copy post pasting that link.

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.680
But Tiger Clay, you do bring up an interesting parallel is

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.800
that just because the game got canceled doesn't mean it's

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.920
canceled forever.

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.480
You know, and I could very much see a DS classic as something

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:51.840
Nintendo does in the future is so weird to think that that's

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.040
where we're at.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.240
But a little a cheap little DS handheld doesn't have to even

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:56.800
be 3DS.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.440
A cheap little DS handheld with, like, 25 games preloaded

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.960
onto it would be huge.

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:05.680
And I bet Nintendo does.

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:08.480
I there may be more.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.000
Yeah, VG realness.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:10.720
Hi, friend.

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.880
In chat says, temper your expectations.

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:13.680
It's Nintendo.

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.520
Bring me down to Earth.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.040
But I feel like a DS classic could be a thing, but maybe

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.960
not before we have a Game Boy classic.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:21.680
We still need it.

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:23.680
Like, if they want to do something real fucking cheap,

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.240
do it.

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.440
Don't even backlight it.

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.280
Do a classic 90s brick fucking Game Boy.

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.720
Of course, the Tetris license might be a challenge to them.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.640
Do you think they dare put something like that out without

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.320
Tetris? I don't know.

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.240
Yes, maybe.

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:39.440
Anyway.

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.160
All right, let's move on.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:44.960
Let's talk about Konami.

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:52.640
And Konami is teasing more stuff for the year 2023, not

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.840
just their Silent Hill stuff, but new developments for

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:56.720
familiar series.

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.800
And I don't even think this means they're arcade stuff.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.760
So this is the year of the rabbit.

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.840
So we are planning power ups and new developments for familiar

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:11.280
series with the aiming of leaping even further.

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.040
This is a quote from Famitsu.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.200
Additionally, we're deeply and quietly progressing on new

01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.240
projects that we have yet to announce to you all.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.160
Konami is leaping forward.

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.800
What a strange tie in.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.560
So by all means, keep bringing Frogger up.

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.840
Well, you probably because I was like, like, time pilot,

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.040
like, leaping forward in time.

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.960
No, it's probably fucking Frogger game.

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.840
That's a Frogger game.

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:39.520
Good job, Loki.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.120
You ruin everything.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.360
All right, you're probably right, though.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.640
Okay, so we're going to get to our next segment.

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.160
Before I roll the segment, because Dark Sakura has already

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.360
put this together for us.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.920
I do want to quickly mention about the 2020.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.200
I still need to talk over it.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.360
Oh, I thought this was.

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.400
I told you my audio got lost last night.

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.120
Oh, my bad.

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:03.840
My bad.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.960
Well, then quickly, before we roll it, I want to talk about

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:11.600
the 2023 twist, because we kind of threw out a few things.

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.320
So of course, the classic game of the week is the segment

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.480
we do every week here on Orange Zones Radio.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:22.560
But ever since what, like 2017, maybe 2016, I'd have to go

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.520
check on the wiki.

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:26.720
But you've been mixing it up for a while now is that one

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.400
month out of the year, you will do a different category.

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.560
Previous categories have included classic 8-bit soundtracks,

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.880
classic pinball machines.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.320
And just last year we was that peripherals and consoles.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.560
Flag was a personal favorite of mine.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.840
But this last year we did classic electronic handhelds.

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.240
This year, what is the new category officially?

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.160
Because we've thrown a few ideas out there, but officially,

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:55.760
what is our new category for 2023?

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.560
Classic non-video game games.

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.560
All right.

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.440
And what defines a non-video game game?

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.400
It's a game that isn't a video game.

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:06.880
Perfect.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.200
All right.

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.680
Quote it, print it, put it on the back of the box.

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.800
That being said, let's get to the segment.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:28.640
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.240
I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.120
you about it.

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.760
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:39.760
All right.

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:41.280
And Dark Sakura, what did you...

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.240
Whoa, sorry.

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.040
Wrong screen.

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.160
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game?

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.440
Set on the screen, it's Mall Madness.

01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:54.640
Mall Madness, sometimes called Electronic Mall Madness,

01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.200
it is a shopping themed board game by Milton Bradley.

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:01.680
The original was released in 1988 with a talking version

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.280
in 1989.

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.000
The game has been updated several times, a new design

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.200
in 1996 and an update in 2004.

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.120
The last one was in 2020.

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:14.080
Oh, and there's other versions, including a Hannah Montana

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.240
version and a Littlest Pet Shop.

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.400
The Hannah Montana version actually has the distinction

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.200
of being the first version that has a dude on the cover.

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.480
So at any rate, the game was designed for players,

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.760
four players, nine and up, mostly young teenage girls.

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.080
And there were commercials targeting them and spending

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.240
the money and running all over the place.

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.440
You know, commercialism.

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.600
At any rate, it had the following contents in the box.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.320
There was the box, the game board, the computer,

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:51.280
the instruction manual, four rubber pads to prevent

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:55.440
the pieces from slipping, six plastic wall pieces,

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:59.120
four cardboard shopping lists, two sale items,

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:03.200
one clearance sign, eight plastic ponds, two of each color,

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:06.720
which are red, blue, yellow, green, and one being male,

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.680
one being female, 40 plastic pegs to mark the shopping list,

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.920
paper money that looks kind of like current, you know,

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:18.800
American money, but color coded, four cardboard credit cards

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:23.040
and 29 pieces of cardboard to hold the thing together.

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.920
It's a three-dimensional field that looks like

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.680
a shopping mall with two stories.

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.920
There's some other places in there, but right in the center

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.960
is your little bank slash credit card thing.

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:44.240
So the voice, the computer thing dictates

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:50.480
where you're playing and it uses like double A's to run.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.760
The computer parts are all made in the US.

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:55.440
It's very keen on saying so.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:58.720
So the computer has two voices, one female, one male,

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.720
and then there's two credit card slots on top.

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:03.760
One is to buy items.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.920
The other one is for the banking.

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:08.720
Now, except the 2004 version only uses a female voice.

01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:16.640
At any rate, you either pay with paper cash or you pay

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.680
with the credit cards and you have four credit cards,

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:23.040
one called Fast Cash from Good Sense Bank,

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:25.920
Quick Draw from Dollar Days Bank,

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.720
Mega Money from Big Bucks Bank,

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:31.120
and Easy Money from Cash and Carry Bank.

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:33.600
Now the stores are the best.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:34.720
The stores have the best names.

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.720
I Am Coffin Drugstore, Suits Me Fine Men's Shop,

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:44.000
Two Left Feet Shoes, Short Circuit Electronics,

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.320
Yuppie Puppies Pets, Scratchy's Records.

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:47.520
That one's pretty funny.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:51.360
Novel Idea Books, Frump's Fashion Boutique,

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.560
The Right, W-R-I-T, Stuff Card Shop,

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:58.400
Fork It Over Kitchen Store, Hocus Focus Cameras,

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:01.920
Sweaty Sports, Made in the Shade Sunglasses,

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:02.880
Chip's Computers.

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:03.840
That one's clever.

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.640
Ruby's Jewelry, Dingling Phones,

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:09.520
M.T. Wallets Department Store,

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.280
and Tinker's Toys.

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.120
And then you have these four other areas.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:15.280
You have Coneheads Ice Cream Shop,

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.160
The Restrooms, Vidiots Arcade,

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.520
and my favorite name ever,

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.880
Aunt Chovy's Pizza.

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:22.800
What do you buy in the restrooms?

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:25.360
You don't.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.560
You just donate.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:27.060
Oh.

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.120
Body stuff.

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:30.880
Hocus Focus is my favorite, by the way.

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.180
Yeah.

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:35.520
So basically the objective of the game

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:39.120
is to be the first person to finish your shopping list,

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.640
to get everything on the list,

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:42.240
and then get back to the parking lot

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.240
or whatever your last destination

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:44.960
is supposed to be,

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:46.560
depending on what version that you're playing.

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:52.240
And to make it more challenging in the 80, 90, 96 versions,

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:54.000
you could increase your goal to 10 items.

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.920
So basically you're going around the shopping mall.

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.880
There's some parts where it'll refuse your credit card

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.960
or nothing will come out of the bank

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:06.000
and there's all kinds of stuff going on.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.440
The first person, of course, to do all that wins.

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:15.200
Um, I did not play this.

01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.040
This was not a part of my childhood.

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.640
It was too expensive and a bad influence,

01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:26.320
which still doesn't explain why I'm a consumer whore today.

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:31.440
But I mean, overall, it's pretty,

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:33.840
I actually would love to get everyone together

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.040
to play one of these,

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.840
but I'd have to get this version, the 96 version.

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:41.120
This may surprise you, but as the token gay

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.120
who had many, you know, lady friends at a certain age,

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:47.440
I never played this game either,

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:49.920
but you know, I wanted to, you know,

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.480
I know this may surprise you,

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.920
but I have played this game.

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:00.240
It was silly.

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:01.200
Did Nelly make you?

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:04.080
No, I played it with my sister.

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:05.440
She had it.

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.080
Okay. Okay.

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:09.680
It does look like it could be fun.

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:10.400
It is fun.

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:12.160
Who doesn't like going to the mall?

01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:12.640
No, it's true.

01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:14.800
I mean, who doesn't like going to the mall?

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:16.000
You know what's sad though?

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.440
We're looking back at this as like, you know,

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.280
the classic not video game of the week now,

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.360
but then like in 10 more years, it's going to be,

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:22.720
what's a mall?

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.160
Anyway, there's more.

01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:30.660
Okay.

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:31.920
Sorry.

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:33.680
I needed chocolate to overcome this.

01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:36.720
At any rate,

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:39.840
Milton Bradley did a line of digital electronic voice

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.680
board games after this.

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.720
In 1990, under their Parker Brothers brand,

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:49.600
they did an updated version of a 1984 game

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.960
called Mystery Mansion that had an electronic voice device.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.200
In 1992, they released a game called Omega Virus.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.520
I knew someone who had this.

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.600
I've never played it and I really want to.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.160
So basically that game takes place on a space station

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:09.840
that's infected by an extraterrestrial computer virus.

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:13.280
And this one actually has a countdown timer

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.800
that if you don't complete your objectives

01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:16.880
before the timer runs out, everyone dies.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:21.520
So it's got a lot more tension to it.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.280
But Michael Gray created Mall Madness.

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:29.440
He also designed Omega Virus and one other electronic game

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.040
you might find familiar.

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:32.400
Dream Phone.

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:35.200
And that's it.

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.080
You didn't decide to combine the two

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:40.080
and make Omega Mall Madness,

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.840
because that sounds like that'd be amazing.

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:44.480
There it is.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.320
Your classic not video game.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.600
And hey, I think the music isn't bad for me

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:51.280
having thrown it together in five minutes.

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.240
No, you did a great job.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:52.740
Thank you.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:54.500
All right.

01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:56.160
Good pick.

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:56.660
Good pick.

01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.000
All right.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.640
And then one day it sounds like we'll have to all get together

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:02.320
and play this game before we go see Megan.

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:02.560
Okay.

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:04.320
I'll have to go find a copy.

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.040
Yeah, right.

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.520
I was like, where do you even find old board games?

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.480
I don't know.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:10.160
So are they all good?

01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:12.480
So somebody had joked when the segment started

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:13.520
and we were defining it.

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:17.120
Somebody said, Miltonious Games and Chat said,

01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:20.640
today's classic non-video game, Tag.

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.360
Technically, Tag would qualify.

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.600
So are we only going to get board games in this segment

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:28.160
or are we going to get like playground games

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.280
and other interesting things?

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.560
Purchasable items.

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:31.520
Okay.

01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.480
Purchasable items.

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:32.720
Okay.

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:33.200
I like that.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:33.840
Okay.

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.720
So, you know, like not just board games,

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:41.040
but like different sorts of games that you can play

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.680
with people around you that you would have bought

01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:46.000
in a store that aren't fucking cards.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:46.500
All right.

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.560
At least that aren't like playing cards.

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.840
Well, and if you want to know more,

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:51.680
hit that follow button, that subscribe button,

01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:54.320
that like button, the donate button, the email button,

01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:55.680
the tweet button, hit it all.

01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:56.800
All right.

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.520
Let's move.

01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:01.600
Just hit a button and hope we see it.

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:01.920
Okay.

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:03.440
Moving on.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.920
Let's get to some rapid.

01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.040
Do you see what next month is?

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:08.960
I can't wait.

01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.560
Microsoft has confirmed that there's going to be some games

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:17.280
leaving Game Pass in the next, well, week or so here.

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.880
So by January 15th.

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.040
Anacrusis.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.400
We've got Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:25.760
Anniversary Edition.

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:29.760
Nobody Saves the World, Paparazzi and Windjammers 2.

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:32.320
Those are going to be leaving Game Pass.

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:36.320
And apparently you get a 20% off of those games

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:38.640
if you decide to purchase them to keep playing them

01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:39.520
like Paparazzi.

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:42.000
Who doesn't like a Paparazzi game with puppies?

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.480
And Roma all the way.

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:44.980
Yep.

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.720
Then, of course, this month we've got some free games

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:54.160
with PlayStation Plus and Xbox games with gold.

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:57.440
So on the PlayStation side, looks like Jedi Fallen Order,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.760
Fallout 76 and Axiom Verge 2.

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.480
Those are going to be your free games for the month.

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:11.840
And then on Xbox, we've got looks like Iris Fall,

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:15.840
which is going to be from the 1st through the 31st.

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:18.160
And then from the 16th through the 15th,

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.440
you also get Autonauts.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:23.120
All right.

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:24.240
Load up on those free games.

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.440
I've been doing that with the Epic Store.

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:30.560
That whole holiday, I only missed one.

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.840
But you know what stinks?

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.240
The one game I missed is the one I wanted to play

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:35.840
most of all out of all they gave away.

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.360
And that was them fighting herds.

01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:38.960
Was the one free game I didn't get during.

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:40.400
Oh, yeah, I didn't get that either.

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:42.160
And I didn't realize that they were doing that

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:44.000
until well after it was started.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.320
I think I did get Death Stranding for free.

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.120
Yeah, that was the big one.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.160
And then there's some other stuff,

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.680
but I can't remember.

01:59:51.680 --> 01:59:52.180
Yeah.

01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:53.080
All right.

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:54.420
Dark Sakura.

01:59:55.860 --> 02:00:04.420
So Namco is bringing in Galaga to the Arcade Archives.

02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:10.180
So it, of course, we know it came out

02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.820
as the sequel to Galaxian in 1981.

02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:17.380
But it is one of their most iconic games

02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:19.940
and it will be a part of that.

02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:25.220
Available to download on PS4 and Switch at eight bucks.

02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:26.920
All right.

02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:29.460
Well, piggybacking on that a little bit

02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:31.860
and talking about the future of Arcade Archives.

02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:36.900
On January 26 in Japan is the New Zealand story.

02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:38.420
So that is probably one.

02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:38.900
Game!

02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:41.140
Yeah, I know it's one that's probably lesser known overall,

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.060
but I know Dark Sakura has certainly picked that

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.580
as a classic game at some point before.

02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:48.260
That is, of course, a sprite based platformer by Taito,

02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:50.900
which will be available on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:54.260
It was originally in arcades in 1988.

02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:56.100
It was a love letter to New Zealand.

02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:59.300
It stars Tiki the Kiwi and you guide the bird

02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.740
through different mazes.

02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:05.940
You use balloons and dirigibles to rescue your animal friends

02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:07.380
that are in cages.

02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:13.700
So this was 1991 localized for the Nintendo Entertainment System,

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:15.300
but they called it Kiwi Craze,

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.940
but it is the same game if you ever saw that game.

02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:20.420
So also the soundtrack.

02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:22.100
A lot of people really dug for that game.

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:23.060
And just so you know,

02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:25.140
that is pretty much in all the streaming services

02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:28.020
where you find music, Amazon, Spotify, YouTube, you name it.

02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:29.700
You can check that out as well.

02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:32.820
So that is available as well.

02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:34.980
By the way, speaking of Taito, since I brought them up,

02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:37.220
I also want to point out it's been announced

02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:41.140
that they're doing a 70th anniversary celebration in 2023.

02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:42.740
70 years of Taito.

02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.420
But that's not how long they've been making games,

02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:47.460
but pretty close.

02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:50.740
But of course, the company behind Space Invaders,

02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:52.180
Bubble Bobble and so forth,

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:55.220
they've made a commemorative website and a Twitter account,

02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:59.940
but no word as to what the celebration is going to be just yet.

02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:01.940
Maybe some type of compilation, who knows?

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:06.340
Of course, Taito originally founded in 1953 by Michael Kogan.

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:10.260
It originally started as vending machines and jukeboxes

02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:13.380
and then went into electromechanical games in the 60s.

02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:17.060
And of course, then it all blew up with Space Invaders in 1978,

02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:22.100
which was in Japan was serious business.

02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:24.740
It was pretty big business here too,

02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:28.820
but probably I would say Pac-Man was the little more like,

02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:29.860
was the bigger game here.

02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:32.740
And then Space Invaders was like even bigger in Japan.

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:36.820
So, all right, let's move on with some release dates.

02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:38.420
I'm not sure we have a lot this week,

02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:42.900
but sometimes companies are starting to put things out early in the year.

02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:44.980
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:46.020
Loki, how about the US?

02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:47.620
We have a few things.

02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:52.100
We have Children of Silent Town on PC, Nintendo Switch,

02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:55.540
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.940
Drago Noka on PC and Nintendo Switch.

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:04.100
Lone Ruin on PC and Nintendo Switch.

02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:08.420
Vengeful Guardian Moonrider on PC, Nintendo Switch,

02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:10.660
PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:15.940
Dragon Ball Z Cockroach on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:21.540
One Piece Odyssey on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:23.860
I'm sorry, that's actually, yeah,

02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:29.140
Xbox Series, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and PC.

02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:29.860
And that is it.

02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:32.660
By the way, just quickly in chat,

02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:34.660
before I get to the Japanese releases,

02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:36.260
Miltonius Games in chat said,

02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:39.860
now I want a Taito 70 made by Digital Eclipse

02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:43.460
kind of tying into the Atari 50 that came out.

02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:46.420
And you know, Taito really does have a pretty rich library.

02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:47.940
They've done compilations before.

02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:52.820
I had one on Xbox that was pretty good for that era of Taito games.

02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:56.420
And I know things like Rygar arcade version was on it.

02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:58.740
And of course, like Bubble Bobble, Paris All Stars,

02:03:58.740 --> 02:03:59.460
and that whole thing.

02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:01.060
And then that made me go,

02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:04.740
ooh, that's a company that Arcade 1up needs to get with.

02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:05.540
Although to be fair,

02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:09.700
I think Taito had their own smaller reduced machines.

02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:11.300
They're probably not interested in getting in business

02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:12.420
with Arcade 1up just yet.

02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:13.860
Although I don't know to be determined,

02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:16.340
but I was like, if I can get a Bubble Bobble machine,

02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.020
that's, ooh, I think a lot of people would go

02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:19.780
for a Bubble Bobble machine, that's for sure.

02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:22.260
So, but anyway, back on track,

02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:24.660
let's talk about what's coming out in Japan this week.

02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:28.500
And the release date for these games on the Nintendo Switch

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.420
would be January 13th.

02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.540
Really, it's just some new amiibo this week.

02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:36.100
A Sephiroth and a Kazuya figure

02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:38.020
will both be out released this week in Japan.

02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.340
That's really it for the Switch.

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.580
Yeah, we don't have another release till the 19th.

02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:44.180
Looking at the PlayStation 5,

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:45.220
okay, we have a couple of games there.

02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:47.700
We have One Piece Odyssey is released this week,

02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:49.060
speaking of Namco.

02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:51.380
They're also putting out Dragon Ball Z Kakarot

02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:52.980
is out this week in Japan as well.

02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.940
That's it for releases this week, so.

02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.340
Oh, sorry.

02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:00.020
YYR says, did you mean Rystan?

02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:01.460
Rygar was Tecmo, I think.

02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:03.300
Yeah, you are correct.

02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:07.460
I got my tease blurred, but there was a collection.

02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:12.180
Because I know I have, oh well.

02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:14.820
Old man brain kicking in,

02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:17.460
but there was some type of compilation I remember having.

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:19.060
Rob, I'm older than you.

02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:19.940
Don't say those things.

02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:20.820
Well, I'm just saying.

02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:26.180
Anyway, is it my turn now?

02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:26.680
Yeah.

02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:27.560
Okay.

02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:31.640
So on the 10th for Xbox,

02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:33.640
we have the House of the Dead remake.

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:40.760
On the 13th for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, One Piece Odyssey.

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.720
And then also on PlayStation and Xbox the same day,

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.200
Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.

02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.280
I've been watching the Japanese version,

02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:56.280
which is better.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.200
The voice actors are better.

02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.800
Rest in peace, Bulma's voice actor.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:02.920
All right, let's move on.

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:04.280
We have a few more headlines for you,

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:07.160
and then we'll try to take some calls if anybody wants to call in tonight.

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:10.360
But I do want to make sure we're wrapped up by 9 Pacific tonight,

02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:12.280
just because with the storms coming in,

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:15.400
I want to make sure Dark Soccer gets some DVD time in.

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:19.400
And I also want time to take an edible and fall asleep.

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:22.600
Take an edible and fall asleep before the storms come in, to be honest.

02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:23.100
All right.

02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:23.960
Do you need to share?

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:27.000
Because I don't.

02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:32.040
What I'm talking about is a perfectly legal activity in California,

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.480
so I'm not doing anything.

02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:37.240
But I only use them when I need to go to sleep.

02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:38.760
So all right.

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.200
I use them for pain relief.

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:42.680
No, seriously.

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:43.320
No, I get it.

02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:44.120
I get it.

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:50.280
I hear it's very popular for Lady Park cramps.

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:51.560
Yes, it very much is.

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:53.560
Oprah, was it Oprah that had a company?

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:59.400
That made edibles for Shark Week.

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:00.200
Interesting.

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:00.760
Interesting.

02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:01.960
Yeah, very cool stuff.

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:03.180
Moving on.

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:05.560
I think we're to Loki.

02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:11.800
Yes, so the developer behind the PlayStation 2 emulator,

02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:18.440
Aether SX2, has decided to discontinue development of the app,

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:23.400
because, of course, not Sony coming after them,

02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:25.960
but, you know, toxic fan community.

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:31.960
Apparently, they're tired of never-ending online impersonations,

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:33.960
complaints, demands, and death threats.

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:35.880
Because that's what you do.

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:39.640
Reach out to developers and threaten them with death

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:42.360
if they don't develop something that's free.

02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:43.640
Okay.

02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:45.080
And they're just not going to do it at all.

02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:51.160
So, yeah, Aether SX2 is always meant to be a fun hobby for me,

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.520
not profit-driven.

02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:55.160
It doesn't make sense to continue working on a hobby,

02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:56.280
which isn't fun anymore.

02:07:57.240 --> 02:08:00.200
Thanks to everyone who wasn't a dick for the last year.

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:04.440
So that is annoying.

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.560
But I hate people.

02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:07.160
Some people's children.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:09.880
It's one of those things where it's like,

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:11.960
you know how we kind of always talk about,

02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:13.640
like, if OLR was going to get big,

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:15.160
we would have gotten big years ago.

02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:20.200
And but it's kind of in some ways nice that we didn't get big.

02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:22.280
This is one of those reasons.

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.400
We haven't had to put up with our share of bullshit

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:26.120
over the years.

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:27.720
But it's one of those things where it's like,

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:32.440
some people's children do not know how to act.

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:37.720
And it's just, it's just, it's so ridiculous.

02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:39.800
It's, it's just, it's sad.

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.440
You know, and on one hand, it's like,

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:43.800
don't give those people the time of day,

02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:46.200
but at the same time, easier said than done.

02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:49.400
Like, and that's the part of where social media,

02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:52.280
especially Twitter, has made it,

02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.920
and all my issues with Twitter aside for a minute,

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:58.040
like that ability to direct message someone,

02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:01.240
basically, even if it's not direct direct messaging him,

02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:03.000
at them, and that there's a good chance

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.440
they're going to read what you say,

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:07.560
like, it's really gross.

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:10.600
And that's why, if I do want to get on my soapbox for a minute,

02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.760
why I completely disagree with the direction

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:14.680
that Twitter's new owner has been taking the company,

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.320
because he wants to make it by the fact

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.080
that anybody can buy a blue checkmark

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:20.600
so that you can yell.

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:22.920
Like that, that's how he wants to make money,

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:25.960
is that you pay $8 a month and you can yell at celebrities

02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:27.480
and they have to read what you say.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.320
But it's kind of like, you do not understand how this works

02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:32.520
and how you're going to drive people,

02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:35.320
the main people from your platform that are lifting your platform up.

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.600
Don't say if they mean to him,

02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.040
because they'll hurt his fee fees.

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:39.960
Or track his plane.

02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:42.760
But anyway, soapbox stuff aside,

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:44.840
it's one of those downsides.

02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:46.680
And of course, it goes without saying,

02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:48.440
I shouldn't have to say it to this audience.

02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.440
I really don't think I need to say it to this audience.

02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:51.880
I think the crowd that would do this

02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:53.560
doesn't listen to this program.

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.720
Good, but don't do this.

02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:00.360
But even, I think people listening to OLR

02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:02.040
are intelligent enough to not do this

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:05.800
when it comes to talking to developers.

02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:09.640
But even consider the way you approach criticism sometimes.

02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:11.800
Constructive criticism, good.

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:15.480
Fuck you, you fucking fuck, bad.

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:17.080
Of course, depending on who it is,

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:18.680
because some people need to be told.

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:27.480
But for the most part, especially normal people,

02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:31.080
like people that are working on these emulators and so forth,

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:32.680
just like you or me or whatever.

02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:34.760
Like, don't be this rude.

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:35.720
It's not necessary.

02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:36.520
Call it normal.

02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.840
Yeah, and there's also a big difference between

02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:42.120
fuck you, you fucking fuck,

02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:46.520
and I'm going to insert the rest of your death right here,

02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.480
because I'm not going to say it,

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:49.240
because somebody's going to quote it out of context.

02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:49.960
Disgusting.

02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.880
Yeah, there's a big, big difference

02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.080
between those two things also.

02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:56.040
Just don't say this stuff, even as a joke.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:56.760
It's not a joke.

02:10:58.840 --> 02:10:59.560
It really isn't.

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:04.600
I don't understand when people started thinking

02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.040
that saying this shit was okay.

02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:07.800
That's what I don't get.

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.720
Phil of Nine in chat says,

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.360
if people approach criticism with an ounce of kindness,

02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:14.440
it would be a better online environment.

02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:14.940
True.

02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:17.820
Maybe an ounce of maturity as well.

02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:19.020
You know, that's part of it.

02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:19.520
For sure.

02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:23.020
All right, let's move on.

02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:26.540
Dark Sakura, even more with Dead by Daylight,

02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:29.020
except this feels like a totally separate game sometimes.

02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:31.980
And it kind of is,

02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:35.580
but I know that people who've talked to me,

02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:38.300
you know, bring up Dead by Daylight Mobile in the past,

02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:42.220
and I couldn't play the old version,

02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.580
but I really was interested in playing the version

02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:48.380
that they got overseas, which is the NetEase version.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:52.380
It had different outfits and different Mori animation

02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.820
and all kinds of neat stuff.

02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:56.220
There was even like this golden Legion mask.

02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:56.860
Oh, so cool.

02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:01.660
So now though, we are getting the NetEase version.

02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:04.300
I am so excited about it.

02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:08.380
And the more pre-registers that they get

02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:13.260
is opening up new rewards.

02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:18.300
So I mean, they're up over 500,000 pre-registers,

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:23.900
which actually now puts people into the Running to Win Wraith statue.

02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:28.140
They're already giving out all kinds of blood points

02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:32.620
and iridescent shards and all kinds of stuff in game.

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:33.980
So I think that that's awesome.

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:39.820
And they're also giving out other special items for pre-registrants,

02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:46.140
like some different cosmetics for Meg, Dwight, for Hillbilly, for Claudette.

02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:52.540
And there is a pre-registration ritual,

02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:55.980
where you can also get a certain Fang Min account,

02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:57.740
and that's if you've signed up for all the things,

02:12:57.740 --> 02:12:59.900
which I was already signed up for most of the things.

02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:01.100
I only had to do one more thing.

02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:06.380
Um, although said outfit will also make you a target

02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:07.820
because it is very bright.

02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:12.300
But at any rate, I mean, the NetEase version of the game

02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:14.140
just has looked amazing.

02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.900
It had all kinds of extras in it.

02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:18.540
I mean, and playing on a mobile device

02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:20.860
is going to be a different experience.

02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:22.620
But I thought it was worth mentioning

02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:24.780
that we are finally getting the NetEase version.

02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:25.920
Huh.

02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:27.840
Cool.

02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:29.740
That's it.

02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:30.460
Off to check it out.

02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:36.060
Do if you if you do the registration stuff, you get bonuses.

02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:37.100
Well, I do like bonuses.

02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:38.320
All right.

02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:41.660
Uh, Loki, another story from you.

02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:45.500
And this is this is, uh, we will talk about these series of games very often.

02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:48.380
This is this is catastrophic for these fans, and it's a bummer.

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:53.420
So, um, you know, the Madden Ultimate team is it's it's a thing.

02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:57.340
People love their ultimate teams and their franchise modes and stuff like that.

02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:02.940
Well, if you loved it enough to play it during December 28th or the 29th.

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:04.220
Got some bad news for you.

02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:08.140
Your franchise save files are probably deleted or corrupted.

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:13.260
So they had an issue where it corrupted their online database, corrupted,

02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:16.860
corrupting the franchise save files for many users,

02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:19.500
essentially deleting their custom leagues entirely.

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.140
And they said, unfortunately, if you've logged into franchise leagues during this time,

02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:28.700
your data was affected due to a data storage issue that resulted in the franchise files

02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:29.420
being corrupted.

02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:35.180
We know this is important that your franchise or how important your franchises are to you.

02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:39.100
And we are actively working on a restore to fix some of the files via backup.

02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:43.500
Unfortunately, they're only they're estimating

02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:47.340
they're only going to be able to recover 40 percent of the users data.

02:14:47.340 --> 02:14:54.700
So a lot of those, it's permanently been wiped out.

02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:57.980
Well, it's going to make people distrustful of this whole cloud thing anyway,

02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:01.020
which, as we all know, the cloud is just somebody else's computer on the Internet

02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:01.900
is what the cloud is.

02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:05.500
But it just it stinks when you can't like, how did they not have a backup

02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:07.740
thing in place like regular?

02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:10.060
It's just like, come on.

02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:12.460
And this isn't some small fry game either, you know?

02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:16.140
Yeah, it's very annoying.

02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:17.440
All right.

02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:23.500
Well, on a somber note, you know, this is the first show of 2023, and we're only eight

02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:24.700
days into 2023.

02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:28.620
And already there's been, you know, a number of people that have touched the game industry

02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:31.100
in one way or another who have passed away.

02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:35.020
So just a moment to acknowledge some of these folks that passed away.

02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:37.020
And there's probably plenty more than this, too.

02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:38.540
This is just the list in front of me right now.

02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:44.460
Earl Bone, who was the voice of Monkey Island's Captain LeChuck, passed away.

02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:48.460
I believe he was also one of those actors that was that guy.

02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:51.900
Because like when I saw the his picture, you know, I was like, Oh, that guy, you've seen

02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:53.980
him in plenty of movies and so forth.

02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:55.580
He was in things like Seinfeld.

02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:58.620
God, I'm trying to think like what movies he was in.

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:02.380
But yeah, he's been in quite a few other things.

02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:04.780
He was in World of Warcraft doing some voices as well.

02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:05.820
And so on.

02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:06.860
He's he's done a lot.

02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:08.300
So unfortunately, he passed away this week.

02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:16.620
Ken Block also passed away, who was involved with some Need for Speed titles, as well as

02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:17.980
the Dirt series.

02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:22.540
His cars, because he's a racing guy, also appeared in the Forza Motorsport series.

02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:25.660
So he has, you know, some connections to that as well.

02:16:25.660 --> 02:16:28.940
So again, that was Ken Block who passed away at the age of 55.

02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:30.060
That's far too young.

02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:33.100
Yeah, it was a snowmobile accident.

02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:36.620
And then you hear that Jeremy Renner was a very similar thing.

02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:39.180
He's still with us, but just scary, scary, scary.

02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:39.740
Be careful.

02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:40.240
Yeah.

02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:42.060
And then this is...

02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:43.500
Don't run your snowplow, y'all.

02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:45.820
Don't own a snowplow.

02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:47.820
Like, why do you have a full-size snowplow?

02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:48.700
Like, seriously.

02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:51.100
Also passing away.

02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:55.740
This was pointed out to us on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:16:55.740 --> 02:17:02.220
James Buster Corley, half of the Dave and Busters title there, co-founder of the Dave

02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:07.420
and Busters chain, passed away on January 2nd at his home at the age of 72.

02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:09.580
So that was...

02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:10.780
So young.

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:12.000
Yeah.

02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:16.300
Unfortunately, it appears he passed away of a self-inflicted wound.

02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:24.700
So, but still his contributions to the gaming culture with Dave and Busters are pretty

02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:25.660
monumentous.

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:27.580
So thank you, Tiger Claw Terminator.

02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:31.500
LeChuck Earl Bone was in the Terminator films as well.

02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:31.980
That's right.

02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:40.060
So anyway, that is it for the stories we had slotted for tonight.

02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:43.980
I do want to take a moment to open it up, though, to any other questions, comments,

02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:45.820
and so forth, or any calls.

02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:51.100
You can join our green room over at our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:54.300
And I would encourage you to join the Discord and chat with us throughout the week as well.

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:58.940
Tiger Claw points out the founder of Creative Labs also passed away.

02:17:58.940 --> 02:17:59.340
That's right.

02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:00.300
I did see that.

02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:05.260
I neglected that that was in the past week, because I'm trying to make up for two weeks

02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:05.500
here.

02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:06.700
But yes, that's right.

02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:07.980
He had passed away as well.

02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:14.060
So we're just a few weeks into the year and not even just a week and a day into the year.

02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:20.060
And it's, you know, I know sometimes it feels like, because I think there's even been comments

02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:23.820
on this in Discord, it feels like, my gosh, we're losing everybody this year.

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:27.100
But, you know, it's what happens.

02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:28.700
Celebrities come, celebrities go.

02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:30.940
It's any take any year.

02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:32.540
Hey, guess what, people?

02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:32.940
What?

02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:33.820
People die.

02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:40.380
Yeah, it's all the time for many reasons, which just means treasure your own life and

02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:42.220
the people that are in it all the more.

02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:42.780
That's right.

02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:50.380
And there's nothing wrong with saying dead or die or being with people near you after

02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:51.180
they have died.

02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:53.500
It's respect for the dead.

02:18:54.140 --> 02:19:01.660
I want to be on display at my house before I'm shot into orbit.

02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:04.300
Do you want something like what the Pope's getting?

02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:05.580
Where you're on full display?

02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:10.700
No, no, not like that, but no, no, no, not lay in state.

02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:16.140
But, like, I remember being a kid and people having, like, their memorials in their living

02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:16.380
room.

02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:22.860
It might just be a Southern thing, but it was done well before the funeral industry

02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:26.060
took over and became a big financial conglomerate.

02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:26.860
No.

02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:31.020
When Jim passed away, they did something in someone's living room for that.

02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:31.820
Like, I remember.

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:32.700
So it's not just a.

02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:35.900
Yeah, but we don't do that anymore.

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.140
And I'm going on a tangent.

02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:38.940
I know I am.

02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:41.980
But it's been something that's on my mind, honestly, enough lately.

02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:45.100
I watched My Girl recently.

02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:51.660
Yeah, talk about crying and then things they get wrong in the funeral industry.

02:19:53.340 --> 02:20:03.340
But, I mean, I think that instead of treating it like I mean, yeah, it can be tragic, especially

02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:04.860
when someone takes their own life.

02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:10.460
But I think that we need to just embrace it a little bit more, you know, and celebrate

02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:14.300
that they lived and that they did good things.

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:17.420
Comments in chat.

02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:21.660
Phil of Nine in chat says, I'm sorry, wait, let me read this one first from Funara.

02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:25.020
It says, my sister wants her body thrown in the back of a truck and taken to the FBI's

02:20:25.020 --> 02:20:25.740
body farm.

02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:26.240
Haha.

02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:33.260
That was donated to science to study idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:38.540
Phil of Nine in chat says, I watched Spoiler Alert tonight, speaking of sad movies about

02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:39.820
dying, but it was beautiful.

02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:42.780
And that's not an actual spoiler because it's in the trailer.

02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:45.100
But you know what's funny?

02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:49.340
Because it makes me think of gay movies and, you know, to put things on a more lighthearted

02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:55.740
note, I do think it is really funny going back to Megan, how Megan has made more money

02:20:55.740 --> 02:20:57.900
at the box office because Megan did very well.

02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:03.500
It didn't make Avatar money, but it made it like made back its budget and then some already.

02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:08.060
So the funny thing about Megan is it's doing well enough where like it did better than

02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:08.940
bros did.

02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:15.020
If it tells you how the gay community is responding to who our real queen is.

02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:17.980
So it's official.

02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:23.420
Megan has dethroned Billy Eichner as the face of gay cinema.

02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:23.920
There it is.

02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:26.480
All right.

02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:29.420
There's no calls.

02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:30.300
That's fine.

02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:31.100
We don't I don't know.

02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:33.020
I didn't check on emails, but I don't remember seeing any.

02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:33.500
I'm sorry.

02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:34.060
I should.

02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:34.540
I did.

02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:35.980
I didn't check on them either.

02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:37.660
I'm a bad email person.

02:21:37.660 --> 02:21:38.540
I can look real quick.

02:21:38.540 --> 02:21:39.040
Sorry.

02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:40.700
Participate at orange.com.

02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:41.340
I'm not sorry.

02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:42.060
I mean, I'm kidding.

02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:43.520
Okay.

02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:46.300
You know what?

02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:48.700
There's nothing but spam.

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:50.860
Yeah, we've been getting targeted with that again lately.

02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:52.780
Um, I fucking hate it.

02:21:52.780 --> 02:21:54.860
DJ Rama S in chat says at Rob Roberts.

02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:55.900
So is that a good thing?

02:21:55.900 --> 02:22:01.020
Asking about the bros and Megan thing and Tiger Claw says, yeah, at least bros doesn't

02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:04.220
talk down to the audience who didn't watch it because the movie was bad.

02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:05.980
I heard the movie was all right.

02:22:05.980 --> 02:22:10.060
Like the Alan actually watched some of it on a plane, but then he realized he was watching

02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:13.100
it on a plane with some of the content in it and turned it off.

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:18.620
Um, but he said it was funny and a lot of people say it was humorous, but I'm kind of

02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:21.740
with what you were saying there is like, I don't appreciate that.

02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:25.660
Like I'm an asshole or I'm letting down the community or something by not seeing your

02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:26.460
stupid movie.

02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:31.020
Cause there's lots of gay cinema out there that doesn't get the type of attention that

02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:31.900
that movie got.

02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:35.260
And it's like extraordinarily frustrating that somebody would use their platform to

02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:37.820
call people that don't go to their, see their movie homophobes.

02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:43.420
Like, I just think that was, that was such a piss poor move on Billy Eichner who does

02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:49.420
some funny things sometimes, but does some really not funny things other times.

02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:51.740
And that is an example, one of the things that's not funny.

02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:53.580
The category of shitty.

02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:53.900
Yeah.

02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:56.940
It's just, it's inappropriate.

02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:05.260
So as far as I'm concerned, Megan kicking his butt is swift justice the way Megan would

02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:05.820
deliver it.

02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:11.100
I like a strong kick in the, the pant region.

02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:13.340
All right.

02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:14.060
Well, that's it.

02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:15.820
There's no calls awaiting.

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:19.260
I guess I should see if there's any last minute stories just as a formality, but I'm guessing

02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:20.220
this week, probably not.

02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:22.140
Not really.

02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:27.820
I was trying to remember what the name of this thing was, but there's a new like virtual

02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:30.700
console system, like the Pico 8 that just got released.

02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:33.820
That's like almost like a super Pico 8, but not.

02:23:34.380 --> 02:23:37.260
I'm just trying to remember, trying to remember what it was called.

02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:38.780
Yeah.

02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:41.260
It's like, it's like a fake console, like the Pico 8.

02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:41.500
Yeah.

02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:43.020
Like the old Sega one, right?

02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:45.340
It is sort of.

02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:48.300
So it's, it's basically, it's a fake console format.

02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:51.580
That's a virtual machine that you can develop games for.

02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:55.420
It's like, they have, you can buy it and then like, you can develop for it for free.

02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:57.100
It doesn't really exist.

02:23:57.100 --> 02:24:04.060
It's just like, it's like arbitrary format that they made up that exists in the digital

02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:04.700
space.

02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:07.100
Although it would be cool if there was a physical Pico 8 console.

02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:11.820
But I was hearing Pico, like the Sega system.

02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:13.020
So that was Mima's hearing.

02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:14.540
Pico, P-I-C-O.

02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:15.900
Pico 8 is what it's called.

02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:18.300
As in De-guy-o.

02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:20.300
Yes.

02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:25.580
Like, I don't remember though what the new one was.

02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:30.220
I saw a video on it earlier this week, but yeah, I can't remember what the new fantasy

02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:31.260
console was.

02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:31.900
Oh, that's what it is.

02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:34.940
Or the Boulevard that the LA Convention Center is on.

02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:42.540
And it leads to the, the best of all the Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles.

02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:46.780
Yeah.

02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:49.260
So I don't know.

02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:50.460
I'll have to find it.

02:24:50.460 --> 02:24:50.960
All right.

02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:53.820
Oh, Philonines says, I used to live near Pico.

02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:55.500
I guess it's one of those, like, just huge.

02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:57.740
I think it's probably like a very, very, very long street.

02:24:57.740 --> 02:25:01.260
Because I remember going down there when I used to travel down there a lot for work.

02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:06.780
There was Victory in Van Nuys, and those were like the streets that went through the entire

02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:09.420
fucking valley, like north side of LA.

02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:13.660
So it's like, you talk about Victory in Van Nuys, you could be talking about like seven

02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:18.460
different cities from Burbank all the way to whatever's on the end of that, Woodland

02:25:18.460 --> 02:25:20.380
Hills or even further, probably even further.

02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:22.300
So, all right.

02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:24.780
Well, that's about it.

02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:26.940
We're going to wrap up tonight.

02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:30.300
That is it for another episode of Orange on its Radio.

02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:31.820
Good way to start 2023.

02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:33.660
Thank you all so much for being here.

02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:35.260
Appreciate you being here.

02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:38.300
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange on its Radio tonight, please tell a friend

02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:39.100
or two about the show.

02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:42.300
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:44.220
need more voices to put out on air.

02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:45.020
Hello.

02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:48.380
So tell a friend a five star review.

02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:48.940
I found it.

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.380
It's the Picotron.

02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:51.420
That's what it's called.

02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:52.620
Picotron.

02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:52.860
Okay.

02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:54.300
Oh, it's just this thing.

02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:54.620
All right.

02:25:55.340 --> 02:25:59.980
Tell a friend a five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found

02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:01.260
this show goes an awful long way.

02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:02.300
So thank you for those as well.

02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:06.620
A follow for VOG Network on Twitch, whether you're here live or not, super appreciated.

02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:11.340
And of course, join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:13.420
Once again, best of luck to our pal Bobby Black Wolf.

02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:13.900
Go to bed.

02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:15.500
You've got some announcing to do in a few hours.

02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:19.500
And that's about it.

02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:23.740
Before I get the final, final thoughts, let me start with Dark Sakura with her final thought,

02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:27.660
because I know you're off to do some Dead by Daylighting.

02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:32.380
Still in my heart of hearts, a filthy pig mane.

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:34.060
All right.

02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:34.700
Have a good stream.

02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:39.660
And Loki, your final thought for tonight?

02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:43.340
I'm hopefully going to be making more content this week.

02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:44.700
I've got a lot of videos to put out.

02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:45.900
Always.

02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:52.620
My final thought is one game I forgot I played this week was No Man's Sky, because I attempted

02:26:52.620 --> 02:26:56.620
to do the redo of Expedition 7 on stream.

02:26:57.420 --> 02:27:02.060
I got so frustrated yet again with climbing those fucking mountains just to get attacked

02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:06.620
by alien things like that was just a poor expedition and I didn't finish it.

02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:11.580
So my streak of completing every No Man's Sky expedition has been broken.

02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:16.700
But to be honest, if I'm going to break it on any expedition, number seven fucking earned

02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:17.260
it.

02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:18.780
So that's it.

02:27:18.780 --> 02:27:19.980
That's it for my final thought.

02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:23.580
We'll see you all here next time in seven days when we do it all again.

02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:25.260
I hope you all have a wonderful week.

02:27:25.260 --> 02:27:26.380
We will see you next time.

02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:27.420
And guess what?

02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:31.100
The holidays live on with our ending tonight because I forgot to flip it out tonight.

02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:32.460
So what about it one more time?

02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:34.620
We're still within are we within 12 days of Christmas?

02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:36.300
No, I guess we're back.

02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:36.860
Well, you know what?

02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:37.900
It's 16 bits now.

02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:39.180
16 days of Christmas.

02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:40.300
Have a good night, everyone.

02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:40.940
See you next time.

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:44.700
