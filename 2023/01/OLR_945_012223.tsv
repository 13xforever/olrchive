0	11120	It's the Attack of the Clones!
11120	13920	No, not the Star Wars prequel, this one was a sequel!
13920	19920	Wortle Clone Qortle, a quad wortle, four boards at once version was purchased by Merriam Webster.
19920	23520	This is the second wortle-like purchase and it is not known when someone will purchase
23520	25000	duo trigortle.
25000	28320	This intro is full of words that couldn't be played in a typical wortle or wortle-like
28320	29320	game.
29640	45160	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45160	52760	where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio and we're live once again episode
52760	58620	number 945 of our show for tonight January 22nd of 2023.
58620	64720	My name is Rob Roberts I'm joined here live on this Sunday evening as I am most often
64720	68620	with my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
68620	69620	Sup bitches.
69620	72180	Hi, how are you doing?
72180	80780	I'm okay I'm tired I stayed up until five in the morning playing Dead by Daylight with
80780	81780	people.
81780	83780	Were you streaming the whole time?
83780	84780	No.
84780	85780	Oh no.
85940	91820	Raven I did I started I'll get to it in classic game, but I did my my retro stream and then
91820	101420	decided to go play DBD with Raven McPherson, Shayla, and Vant Bunny and and I ate whiskey
101420	104700	filled chocolate the entire time.
104700	108620	I was very stupid by the end of it that's the only thing I can say for myself.
108620	112660	I I we were having giggle fits at the end.
112660	116980	But the best games of Dead by Daylight you played this week were with me earlier this
116980	120720	week even though I completely got you killed in one match because I thought For the People
120720	123220	would work on a on a course.
123220	128740	And I still am sorry about my reaction I just was so flabbergasted.
128740	133380	I was so flabbergasted by that I'm like no don't touch me stop.
133380	137580	Yeah and your your mic and I was saying but your mic does this noise gate thing where
137580	141660	I think sometimes when you're like no no like it actually doesn't come through so I'm like
141660	144860	what's going on I see the icon sometimes sometimes I don't because I think I was trying
144860	146260	to give it to the wrong person.
146260	149620	So anyway, it was just it was just a comedy of errors at that point.
149620	158020	So I actually think that you might have used it on Gwen but that was just like, and I like
158020	162860	I had to step away for a moment to get myself to chill out a little.
162860	165540	I mean, it's fine.
165540	167780	I mean, in retrospect, it was pretty hilarious.
168140	174220	Um, but I'll get more into my Dead by Daylight shenanigans because I'm already gold one.
174220	174820	All right.
174820	178940	Well, speaking of comedy of errors also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
180780	182700	See, the mic's not muted.
183260	188780	I keep pushing the button and it's like it's like, yes, no, yes, no, yes.
189580	192380	I did not install the switch so you could have a microphone rave.
193500	197180	Anyway, pretty much it will it already blinks when you when you have it on mute.
197180	203020	So you know, I every week, of course, we tape our show live Sunday nights at the voice of
203020	208300	geeks network twitch.tv slash v o g network Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern six
208300	211260	o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
211260	211740	Let's be real.
211740	216700	We don't start till about 610 or so because we give Bob we give Bobby his space to finish
216700	217180	the show.
218060	224540	But if you watch us live, you get to see the visuals you get to see us things in our spaces
224540	229100	that we do the show from and Loki oftentimes will have a game playing behind him.
229100	233340	And tonight I noticed Loki has got is that is no B no B boy tonight, right?
233340	234460	There's no B no B boy.
234460	236540	Yeah, a little bit of a flashback.
236540	239980	And now I guess that game is older than I think it is a little bit of a flashback.
239980	241820	It's the computer when only the phone.
241820	242320	Yeah.
243100	248140	No B no B boy, of course, from the creator of Katamari Damacy in between the whole I'm
248140	250540	gonna go build kids playground stuff, right.
250540	257100	But it it the art style and the look of the game is very similar to Katamari Damacy, obviously,
257100	259020	in that it's it's a little wild.
260140	260640	But cute.
261500	264060	It's Yeah, it's interesting.
265020	269820	What a what brought no B no B boy to mind this week.
270380	273740	You're gonna laugh because this is it's really mundane.
274460	274960	Okay.
275340	278940	Let's put away laundry and have a no B no B boy shirt actually have multiple no B no
278940	280380	B boy shirts.
280380	283340	So I just thought I was like, Oh, yeah, hey, I can do that.
283340	286860	No, that's I think of the Golden Girls often for a similar reason.
286860	289020	So yeah, there you go.
289900	290400	All right.
291020	296060	Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight and get into the stories tonight.
296060	298620	First off, I do want to acknowledge those we are taping live tonight.
300140	303260	What an amazing hype train going on in the chat right now.
303260	303980	That's incredible.
304620	308380	It just I just saw an alert that said we're about to break our record.
308380	312540	And I think with those five gift subs Mike Def just dropped, we just might have broken
312540	314300	our record for hype train.
314300	316780	I don't know how long it's been tracking those trains for.
316780	317340	But you know what?
317340	318860	That's that's here.
318860	319900	Maybe I don't know.
319900	320620	But you know what?
321180	321580	Thank you.
321580	322540	No, seriously.
322540	324460	That's incredibly generous of all of you.
325580	330060	Huge motivation to be here on Sunday nights and keep doing this for all of you.
330060	334060	Although honestly, I like hanging out with my friends, Matt and Jamie.
334060	337500	And this has been a pretty good excuse to do that for the last 21 years.
338700	342460	So let's get into it.
342460	343260	What do we do here?
343260	346380	We talk about what's going on in the gaming world and gaming news and all of that.
346380	352060	So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which I wish we had better news tonight.
352060	358220	Unfortunately, this is just probably a symptom of what's going on in the world period, right?
358220	362140	So let me start with actually Dark Sakura tonight with our kickoff topic tonight on
362140	363260	what's going on in the industry.
364300	365740	Shenanigans and bullshit.
366540	370540	Um, it's it's it's consumerism.
370540	373340	It's it's capitalism at work.
374220	382060	So the the tech industry is experiencing a crap load of layoffs.
383420	385580	They are at Microsoft.
385580	394060	They're announcing they announced Wednesday plans to cut 10,000 jobs, including 343 Industries,
394060	400140	the coalition, and Bethesda, League of Legends.
401900	406140	Sorry, Riot Games, who does League of Legends, has cut more than 40 jobs.
409180	414780	Microsoft, I mean, now keep in mind that Microsoft's layoffs are less than 5% of its
414780	415660	total workforce.
416620	423020	But still, I mean, this is this is pretty, that's a lot of people who are going to be
423020	423500	out of work.
425820	431980	And then Google is cutting 12,000 jobs.
433660	441340	Their CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that they were hired for a different economic reality
441340	443580	than the one we face today, end quote.
443580	446540	And of course, this is coming right after the shutdown of Stadia.
447180	447500	Fuck.
448140	450940	Anyway, RIP Stadia.
451900	457020	Unity is eliminating 284 jobs.
457980	462300	They're closing a sports and live entertainment department to end a project that would let
462300	464860	viewers watch sports matches from different angles.
468700	473020	There's Riot Games is laying off 46 people.
474700	475980	It's there.
475980	479900	The analysts are saying there's going to be even more that they're trying to preserve
479900	483820	their profitability in the face of an oncoming recession.
483820	493900	But I mean, would it make sense to remove people's sources of income that they could
493900	495980	be putting back into the economy?
498060	502060	Well, we can't pay these employees if we want our Sting concerts, you know, it's either
502060	504460	Sting or employees and I just like Sting better.
505420	507580	No, they want to the CEO.
507580	512540	I want to see the CEOs take their pay cut to retain employees.
512540	513580	That's what I want to see.
513580	518380	Do you remember when the Wii U had its flop era, which was pretty much the whole time
518380	519180	it was released?
519180	519740	Sorry.
519740	523100	I know some of the games are great, but let's be real, the Wii U for all intents and purposes
523100	523900	was a flop.
523900	530060	Do you remember when Miyamoto took personal responsibility and said, I am cutting my salary
530060	530540	this year?
530540	532220	Miyamoto, that was Iwata.
532220	532700	Oh, I'm sorry.
533660	535580	Sorry, horrible mistake to make.
535580	541740	But it was Iwata that, yes, said I'm going to cut my salary on this whole thing because
541740	543820	of the poor performance of the Wii U, right?
544460	545820	And that's why-
545820	547900	That was an amazing news.
547900	549260	That's why he's respected.
551340	552540	Even Emeritus.
554540	556220	Anyhow, sorry, I just wanted to add that.
556220	566540	It's absolutely disgusting that people are more worried about their own pockets than
566540	572460	the longevity of their company and the well-being of their employees, that they could just let
572460	573420	them go like that.
573420	575020	It's absolutely disgusting.
577020	585660	Yeah, it's really telling that the senior level executives don't bear the brunt in a
585660	589420	similar proportion when these sorts of things happen.
589420	595420	That's the real kind of disgusting and what ought to be frankly illegal part of this.
595420	597260	But what do I know?
598220	599100	But yeah.
599100	601020	But I guess let me ask this question too.
601020	604540	Well, actually, let me go to Loki and see if there's anything you wanted to add on this,
604540	606540	because I know you've been following the story too, Loki.
607260	612620	Well, I remember seeing some stuff where they were cutting departments dedicated to, what
612620	617260	was it, the mixed reality stuff and HoloLens.
617260	620620	So I guess that's a development we're not going to see for a while.
620620	628380	And then just different game teams as well, like 343 Industries, which is understandable
628380	631740	because Halo Infinite was kind of rocky.
631740	635100	Well, but then there were those weird rumors about they're not going to do Halo anymore
635100	637900	to which they actually came out on their actual Twitter and said,
637900	640940	we look forward to doing Halo for a long time.
640940	646940	That doesn't mean they won't partner with others or that sort of they can oversee Halo
646940	648460	without doing it themselves.
648460	654940	But any way you slice it, unfortunately, a lot of people that worked on Halo Infinite
654940	657500	are not employed as of this week, which stinks.
658460	663420	Yeah, I don't know if it's because they're trying to grow too fast or something like
663420	668140	that, because, I mean, Microsoft has been doing a lot of acquisitions of different companies.
668140	669900	I'm sure Google does the same stuff.
672140	672700	I don't know.
673740	677180	I don't understand how CEOs operate.
678060	679500	Some comments from chat.
679500	683100	Sjo and Hunter Matt says these companies knew they were going to do this months ago, but
683100	685500	they waited until after the holidays to do it.
685500	687020	Like that is supposed to hurt any less.
687020	689180	I mean, at least it was something.
691740	692780	Yeah, it could be worse.
692780	696300	They could do what the guy at Twitter did and do it two weeks before the holidays.
696300	698460	But anyway, whatever.
698460	702060	It's not these people who got laid off fault that these companies grew too quickly and
702060	705500	they didn't forecast or support the people that they rushed to hire.
706300	709420	That is a theme that you see a lot throughout the industry.
709420	711980	But again, whose fault is that at the end of the day?
712940	714300	It's typically leadership.
715180	717260	It's leadership, for sure.
717260	718060	This is a bummer.
719580	720860	So what happens now?
721580	727660	Luckily, one nice thing about the gaming industry is that I've noticed that the game developers
727660	729740	and so forth, they really look out for each other.
729740	733900	That's why also, your reputation is very important.
733900	739180	This is also why you never see game developers talking shit about each other on Twitter or
739180	740300	any type of social media.
740300	742540	You sure do see the players talking shit about them.
744380	747740	And that's why a lot of players don't end up getting into the industry.
747740	749180	All tea, all shade.
749260	756140	Is that because when you build out that reputation for yourself or a lot of journalists and podcasters
756140	759020	and yes, I completely am self attacking.
760460	765820	A lot of reasons people like us don't get into the industry is because our reputation
766860	771180	ends up getting ruined because of the stuff we say on social media and things like that.
771180	774220	This is a very small industry and bridges can burn quickly.
774220	777820	That being said, though, I don't want to focus on the negative because for the most part,
777820	779020	people know how to act.
779580	783580	And a lot of the gaming industry really does look out for each other.
783580	789900	And I think oftentimes when we see large gaming studio gets too large and gets bought, then
789900	795180	a spin off studio ends up opening up inevitably, and we'll start to hire and so forth.
795740	799500	So at least the gaming industry is really good about looking out for its people.
800220	805100	It's just very disruptive, obviously, because sometimes that means it's going to be relocation.
805180	811100	Although, you know, in the in this, you know, pandemic, I don't want to say post pandemics
811100	811980	pandemic is not over.
811980	818140	But it's in this people feel over it pandemic world that we're in now, you know, more people
818140	818780	work from home.
818780	821820	So do you need to necessarily be relocating?
821820	822220	I don't know.
822220	823980	I guess that depends on the company you're signing up for.
824700	827020	I'm gonna say something about management in general.
827020	827420	Yeah.
827420	833100	That no matter where the management starts off in the company, eventually they forget.
836060	837260	They become corporate.
838140	841500	And it's it's just something that happens.
841500	844860	I have seen it happen to the nicest people.
845420	850620	It changes who they are, because then the only thing that they are looking at is base
851340	854700	numbers, big picture, high level things.
854700	860780	And forgetting what really makes the company work is what reality is like.
862380	863980	I'm looking at some other comments in chat.
863980	866540	DJ Rama S says a lot of them got severance pay.
866540	868380	It's something at least to be fair, Rama.
868380	869500	Yes, I don't disagree.
869500	875020	But a lot of that's mandated retired, required to Yeah, a lot of that is mandated because
875020	879260	like, for example, I think in Europe, I may be wrong.
879260	881500	And if I'm talking out of my ass, I apologize.
881500	887100	I believe in Europe, it's you have to give 90 days notice that you're going to terminate
887100	890460	somebody's position for a company of a certain size.
890460	895260	The way companies get around that they pay 90 days of severance, because that way they're
895260	898300	basically able to say, Oh, we're laying you off today.
898860	900700	But it's effective as this this date.
900700	901820	And that's what you're getting paid for.
901820	905100	So severance is how they kind of get around some of those laws sometimes.
905100	907660	I realize some companies go above and beyond.
907660	908620	And that is awesome.
908620	912460	But I, I don't want to give the executives too much credit.
912460	913340	It's where I'm going.
913340	918460	No, I know I hear legally severance begins after the last date worked.
919100	923820	So, um, so something like that wouldn't fly.
923820	928060	It's like when you are no longer considered an employee of the company.
928060	930460	That's when you start getting your severance payout.
930460	930960	Yeah.
931660	935020	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they've gotten really good at looking after each other talking
935020	937660	about the folks in the industry, because this happens so often.
937660	938860	They have lots of practice.
938860	942620	We have a saying at my company that the best way to ruin a great developer is to make the
942620	943120	management.
943120	948880	Questbuster says corporations take advantage of feast or famine cycles with ruthless abandon.
948880	952880	Expect them to gorge when things are on fire and watch them amputate what they don't need
952880	953920	to stop the bleeding.
953920	956880	But the weird the weird thing I mean, I don't disagree with what you're saying Questbuster,
956880	961920	but the weird thought that it leads me to is that here, I swear we were just sitting
961920	962880	here two weeks ago.
962880	964560	I mean, I can't believe we're at the end of January.
964560	968880	But I, I feel like we were just sitting here doing our predictions two weeks ago.
969040	974480	And we were looking at, wow, what a big wow, my my my my inner Jennifer Coolidge just came
974480	974980	out.
974980	975480	Wow.
976480	979920	2023 is going to be a year for the games.
979920	983680	But I mean, really, it's it's there's so many big things coming out this year, right?
983680	985920	There's there's Zelda, right?
985920	988320	There's Final Fantasy 16.
988320	991280	There's a PSVR two, if that's what you're into.
991280	994480	There's potentially maybe a switch rebrand or something.
994480	996880	And you never know what else the switch is going to be into.
996880	1002080	Like, when we're looking at what is slated to come out this year, and yes, I understand.
1002080	1004480	Things get pushed back on the calendar all the time.
1004480	1005120	Yes, yes, yes.
1005120	1010320	But overall, looking at 2023 as a year, it looks like it's going to be a big fucking
1010320	1010820	year.
1010820	1016960	Now, I because I already know some of you are thinking it perhaps, okay, those games
1016960	1018320	are all about to go gold.
1018320	1020320	So we're going to lay off this test team.
1020320	1025440	But I also feel like so many of those games like, I'm sorry, Final Fantasy 16, that's
1025440	1031280	Final Fantasy 16, not having DLC, especially looking after at looking at 15.
1031280	1032160	Yeah, right.
1032160	1033840	Zelda not having deals.
1033840	1037120	Like I feel like games are playing the long game.
1037120	1039200	At this point, you need teams to be around a while.
1039200	1044000	So it's just but then again, Square and Nintendo, the games I keep referencing are not two of
1044000	1047520	the companies that we're talking about right now in regards to layoffs.
1047520	1051760	So I mean, maybe I'm just applying the wrong things to the situation.
1051760	1058960	But I still feel like it's a decent year ahead for Microsoft and Game Pass and all
1058960	1059440	of that.
1059440	1061120	It's just a little weird to me.
1061120	1061620	I don't know.
1063520	1063840	Let's see.
1063840	1065360	Looking in chat at some other comments.
1066400	1070320	Darted Studio says hell yeah, Zelda clearing off my calendar for that one.
1071040	1071600	Let's see.
1071600	1074800	Zen Monkey 11 says that was a great Jennifer Coolidge impression.
1075520	1075920	Thank you.
1075920	1076800	You know what?
1076800	1077300	What?
1077760	1079760	I was thinking Charlie the Unicorn.
1080320	1085680	Oh, Candy Mountain, Charlie.
1085680	1086720	These gays.
1086720	1087920	They're trying to murder me.
1088800	1090320	Now I want to see her.
1090320	1092240	It's a magical Leopleradon.
1092880	1095680	Now I want to see her as a Twitch streaming playing games.
1095680	1098240	Actually, Zen Monkey 11 on a completely unrelated note.
1098240	1099600	I love Jennifer Coolidge.
1099600	1106400	And I look anybody like I think any person I was about to say any gay person, any person
1106400	1110880	period with taste is happy to see all the love that she's getting.
1110880	1115200	Thanks to things like White Lotus and things that should have been happening when she was
1115200	1117120	Stifler's mom like a long time ago.
1117120	1117440	Right.
1117440	1122720	And legally blonde and all that when she was playing all the hairdress rules.
1122720	1124400	My point with Jennifer Coolidge.
1124400	1125920	She just started a TikTok.
1126640	1131440	So she's inching closer to the streaming thing, but she has an official TikTok now.
1131440	1134240	So anyway, let's see.
1134240	1139680	Evil Protagonist says, hopefully Google started with the team that made Stadia.
1139680	1141280	Here's the thing, Evil Protagonist.
1142240	1143760	It's not the fault of many others.
1143760	1146560	Actually, those people made a good product.
1146560	1147060	They did.
1148480	1149360	It's Phil Harris.
1149360	1154000	Phil Harrison's the one that needs to get laid off because his messaging sucked, you
1154000	1157760	know, and, you know, I just I don't know.
1157760	1163040	Like I don't want to take it out on the teams who oftentimes were just doing what they were
1163040	1166160	told and oftentimes actually have a really good idea.
1166160	1168400	And it's just poorly fucking supported in marketing.
1169680	1170400	Food for thought.
1171920	1172240	Let's see.
1173760	1174800	Other comments in chat.
1175440	1181280	Bobby Blackwolf says, but I'm glad that everyone is going to be celebrating the anniversary
1181280	1182800	of my 29th birthday this year.
1182800	1185040	I mean, they'll say they're crying for a kingdom.
1185040	1189840	This is a play on the Zelda game, but I know it's really for my anniversary.
1190560	1195120	SSJ100Matt says, speaking of White Lotus, I got to see Aubrey Plaza's SNL performance
1195120	1195600	last night.
1195600	1196800	I heard it was good.
1196800	1200080	I don't know if Shad Leland's still in chat, but he could tell you all about it and we're
1200080	1201120	derailing, but I don't care.
1202400	1207040	So you could watch like all of Saturday Night Live before it even airs on the West Coast
1207040	1208960	because they put it all on YouTube.
1208960	1213520	So before it even aired here, I was looking up the Megan 2.0 sketch they did last night
1214080	1215680	and that was really funny.
1215680	1220800	Like, it could have been funnier, but some of the jokes that they did, like, they were
1220800	1222880	they she didn't yet.
1222880	1223760	Don't spoil it.
1223760	1229920	Okay, no, I bet they say stop singing this song and play something, play something the
1229920	1231280	gays can get into or something like that.
1231280	1233680	And they start playing the theme from White Lotus.
1233680	1238560	That was the part that made me laugh the loudest because the theme from White Lotus is so,
1238560	1240800	like, specific.
1241200	1243200	It's like a very specific kind of meme.
1244240	1249760	So and just playing that it's like this is a song the gays get into is absolutely true.
1250480	1252720	So I just thought that was a very smart joke.
1252720	1257040	Anyway, Tiger Claw says they already announced a sequel to Megan.
1257040	1257920	Yes, they did.
1257920	1259040	They absolutely did.
1260720	1264320	Speaking, let's derail the train further because I've got to give a shout out to this.
1264320	1267600	So Megan drag acts are all the rage right now.
1268560	1275840	One of my friends is a drag performer and they did a Megan drag act last night, but
1275840	1280080	they I got to play a victim in their act.
1280080	1284080	And so, yeah, I got to have my ear removed as part of the act.
1284080	1284960	So there was there was fake.
1284960	1287920	My ear was like covered in fake blood when it was all done and all this stuff.
1287920	1288480	It was.
1288480	1292000	So I was like, and we were even joking as they were telling me before the show, they
1292000	1294880	were like, Megan acts.
1294880	1296560	There's so many on YouTube right now.
1296560	1300720	And I said, red, red, because drag queen is red for filth, which if look up red for
1300720	1302000	filth, they're great name.
1302000	1302960	Yeah, red.
1303600	1307600	I told her I said, Red, you're the only one that's going to have an act with a real
1307600	1308640	live victim.
1308640	1310000	And they were like, Oh, good point.
1310720	1313360	So I said, you're up in the ante with your act.
1313360	1315520	So but it was a lot of fun.
1315520	1320160	And yes, since I wasn't hosting the show last night, because, you know, I got to share
1320160	1322560	sometimes there's lots of talented hosts in the area.
1322560	1324080	I got to participate in the act.
1324080	1329120	So anyway, just wanted to shout that out there randomly as we're talking about layoffs.
1329120	1329520	Sorry.
1331040	1335440	Sorry for the bad news about layoffs, but we could talk about drag queens can always
1335440	1336160	make you feel better.
1336160	1336660	Right.
1337520	1338020	All right.
1339600	1342400	Let's see other comments in chat.
1342400	1342640	Yeah.
1342640	1346320	As Joan Hunter Matt says, can't derail if the train was never on the rails to begin
1346320	1346640	with.
1346640	1348000	Yeah, that's that's very true.
1348000	1348400	Train.
1348400	1349120	That's very true.
1350080	1350480	All right.
1351200	1355040	We just have a boat that's kind of trying not to capsize.
1356240	1360560	Well, in all seriousness, you know, if you were somebody that was affected by the layoffs,
1361200	1362480	I'm very sorry to hear it.
1362480	1367280	And, you know, refer back to what I said earlier, the industry is very good at taking care of
1367280	1367760	its own.
1367760	1371120	So, you know, don't be afraid to ask for help.
1371120	1376000	If you are a social media user, you know, I'm not usually one to sit here to talk good
1376000	1376640	about Twitter.
1376640	1379600	But I completely understand people are there.
1379600	1383280	Doing a shout out on a platform like that might help you find something.
1383280	1386320	I personally have had a lot of luck over the years of LinkedIn.
1386320	1387280	I'm not in the gaming industry.
1387280	1390480	I'm in a different industry, but LinkedIn has been great for networking, connecting,
1390480	1391440	and finding positions.
1392400	1395840	And, heck, Mastodon, a lot of people have been moving over there.
1395840	1397120	A lot of good stuff there, too.
1397120	1399040	And plenty more.
1399040	1402240	So, you know, use that social networking.
1402800	1404240	Yeah, use that social networking.
1404880	1409680	And just don't be afraid to say, hey, this news sucks.
1409680	1410640	Can anyone help me?
1410640	1413680	Because you never know who is out there that might have a good lead for you.
1414240	1415680	So, all right.
1416400	1421040	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing
1421040	1421680	this week.
1421680	1425200	So, Dark Soccer, I know we got into it a little bit ago, but would you like to tell us more
1425200	1426000	about your gaming week?
1427920	1433120	I, of course, have been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight because it's my jam.
1434080	1441920	And, of course, I finished Final Fantasy V, and so I started Star Ocean last night.
1441920	1445760	And mind you, I have never played any of the Star Ocean games.
1445760	1449120	I knew I would be starting it from scratch pretty much.
1449760	1453600	And so far, oh, my God, why did this game not come out over here?
1453600	1454400	It's beautiful.
1455600	1462480	Like, it's the type of pretty level that Sake and Densetsu 2 and 3 were.
1463360	1470000	You know, just really well animated, and it has digitized voice acting.
1471920	1476240	Like, the whole beginning of the game is voice acted.
1476960	1477840	It's so good.
1477840	1478240	And the music is so good.
1478240	1479600	Super Metroid did it first.
1482640	1487600	Super Metroid had hardly any spoken text in comparison to this game.
1487600	1491120	The last Metroid was in captivity.
1491120	1493280	Which is the limit of the voice in that.
1493280	1496560	This has, like, whole bridge conversations.
1497760	1503200	Tell me, though, that you were floored as a young adult hearing that Super Metroid
1503200	1504400	voiceover for the first time.
1504400	1506640	Like, it's talking.
1506640	1507360	It's talking.
1507360	1507920	Anyway, yes.
1507920	1511840	Well, I'm also going to say Kirby's Avalanche.
1513600	1516400	Which said even less, Kirby's Avalanche.
1516960	1520320	And all the characters said things like, yeah, ta.
1521760	1522960	And how could I forget?
1522960	1523760	Pikachu!
1524480	1525360	Pikachu!
1528000	1528800	At any rate.
1531120	1534880	But I'm absolutely in love with it.
1534880	1536160	It's such a good game.
1536160	1537920	It's such a good game so far.
1540320	1545280	It's like sci-fi fantasy JRPG gold.
1545280	1546560	Platinum, even.
1546560	1547520	I really enjoy it.
1548480	1554240	So also, of course, I've been playing Marvel's Midnight Suns.
1554240	1558080	I freaking love, love, love, love, love that game.
1558080	1558800	It's so good.
1561440	1565200	And what else is I playing?
1566480	1570080	I might be playing a little bit of Cult of the Lambs soon just because I kind of miss
1570080	1572640	running around and I love the music in that game.
1572640	1579120	And I need to make sure that my cultists don't forget who to worship.
1581680	1585280	But yeah, that's been the thing.
1585280	1588880	And I know what I like.
1590560	1590880	All right.
1591600	1595440	Well, speaking of players that I think know the games that they like,
1595440	1596720	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1597600	1599840	Well, it's all Minecraft.
1600800	1613040	It was just working on designing terraforming for an area that I started a few episodes ago.
1613040	1615600	So with like the creeper man stuff.
1615600	1617360	And so now I finished the terraforming.
1617360	1621600	But it took forever to design it because I did a bunch of custom trees.
1621600	1626880	And so those take time, especially since I'm not copying and pasting them.
1626880	1630640	I made like 30 plus trees.
1630640	1631120	I don't know.
1631120	1631680	They're big.
1633440	1635040	So yeah, it's been that.
1635040	1641280	And then today I've been trying to get I was trying to design stuff for my modded single
1641280	1644000	player or well, I say single player.
1644000	1644800	That was a slip.
1645360	1648800	No, it's multiplayer, but no one plays on the server anymore.
1649680	1654640	So it my multiplayer series or modded series.
1654640	1657520	But you know me, I can't stop adding mods to it.
1657520	1663600	And so I got we finally hit that point where maybe there's too much too many mods added
1663600	1666320	to the game is having stability problems.
1666880	1669440	So I'm trying to balance that a little bit.
1669440	1672000	I think I had one mod that was conflicting with another one.
1672880	1674640	And I think I found replacements for it.
1674640	1680240	But then I'm also adding something or want to add something that adds buildable airships.
1680880	1684720	That might be too much with all the physical, the physics calculations.
1684720	1693120	I know my frame rate was starting to get a bit low with I like having the shaders on.
1693120	1698720	The shaders look so good, but yeah, it cuts the frame rate in half, especially when you
1698720	1702800	have like, you know, mods that are doing physics calculations on a bunch of different blocks
1702800	1703360	and stuff.
1703360	1709680	It's it's not we may have to turn the shaders off eventually, and that's so hard for me.
1711040	1713440	No, but I'm playing around with it right now.
1715280	1716480	So yeah, I'm working on that.
1716480	1720960	And then hopefully going to I think I may work on the actual building because I designed
1720960	1724640	everything on our creative server because we have a creative server that we can just
1724640	1725680	fly around and do whatever.
1725680	1731520	And then we just copy stuff to a schematic and then bring it over to the survival server,
1732400	1734720	which then I have to build it all by hand again.
1734720	1736160	So I have to do that now.
1736160	1738240	I've been collecting resources for that.
1738240	1742240	And they had a lot of leaves, so that took a few days.
1742240	1748400	And then last year, yesterday, I was just mining the ton.
1748400	1754240	So I ended up filling up a lot of my storage room with supplies for future projects and
1754240	1754740	stuff.
1756320	1758880	So yeah, it looks really, really good, though.
1758880	1762640	It looks really good because I have these trees that are kind of like they look like
1762640	1765200	big redwood trees almost.
1765360	1770320	I guess they're big spruce trees, but they're also because if you play Mega Man or anything
1770320	1774640	like that, or at least seen screenshots of it, you know, like in all the backgrounds
1774640	1779520	and stuff that kind of like nature things, but it's also like artificial nature things.
1779520	1784400	So you see like kind of panels ripped off the trees where you have metal exposed and
1784400	1785120	stuff like that.
1785120	1786640	So I'm building stuff like that.
1786640	1787920	It looks really cool.
1788800	1791680	So I really like the way it came out.
1791680	1793840	So it'll be hopefully pretty soon.
1793840	1795520	We'll have an episode out for that.
1795520	1796560	Okay, cool.
1797920	1799040	Let's see my gaming week.
1799040	1802080	So honestly, it's a lot of the stuff I talk about often.
1802880	1808880	Final Fantasy XIV, my island sanctuary is now rank 11, which means I have access to
1808880	1813520	the new seeds they added in the recent patch, which I believe is paprika and leeks.
1813520	1815440	So I'm now growing leeks in my garden.
1815440	1820480	I'm growing a ton of both of those to kind of get caught up, but I should be ranked 12
1820480	1821120	next week.
1821120	1826240	And that means I get access to the new alligator mount and the ever important speedo cosplay
1826880	1827840	for my character.
1827840	1828960	Very important to get that.
1828960	1829920	Dyable, by the way.
1829920	1832320	So any color that you possibly imagine.
1832320	1836160	And because glamour, of course, is the end game, true end game of Final Fantasy.
1836160	1840240	So working on that, still playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, but I actually canceled
1840240	1843840	my account because I'm like, okay, I think I've done everything I'm going to do in my
1843840	1844640	little revisiting.
1845520	1849760	If I suddenly start picking up and doing more mythic dungeons in the next week or something
1849760	1853440	to keep me engaged, then maybe I'll suck her up and buy another month.
1853440	1855040	But otherwise I was like, you know what?
1855040	1859280	I'm going to just cancel it just so I don't accidentally auto renew.
1859280	1860400	So we'll see how that goes.
1861440	1865840	Still been playing like cell phone games, you know, between Ingress and Pokemon Go.
1865840	1869280	There was a classic event for Larvitar Community Day yesterday.
1869280	1870640	So I did that for a little bit.
1871600	1876000	Pikmin also, I walked 12,000 steps yesterday because Pikmin had a community day to walk
1876000	1876800	10,000 steps.
1876800	1881520	So walked a lot, a lot yesterday, but it was good as daffodil day.
1881520	1885280	So growing lots of daffodils was the plant they introduced in that game recently.
1887040	1892080	Also, if you follow the Niantic products, word on the street is, I don't know if this
1892080	1896960	will actually happen or not, but word on the street is that NBA All World is going to launch
1896960	1899760	on Tuesday in all regions.
1899760	1903600	So it's being tested.
1903600	1909840	It's being tested right now in like France and Canada and like other other regions, very
1909840	1911440	limited select areas.
1911440	1912800	Yeah, I'm curious.
1912800	1918880	Like, look, I may not be a sports person, but number one, sports, when sports video
1918880	1921520	games are done well, I'll eat it up.
1921520	1925440	And case in point, if you want to talk NBA, how about NBA Jam?
1925440	1928000	Probably one of the greatest fucking sports games of all time.
1928000	1931120	Even people like me who are like, I don't really play sports games.
1931120	1933120	It's like, oh, but NBA Jam is really cool.
1934080	1936960	So what is the game?
1936960	1938080	Like, what is the game?
1938800	1940560	I actually get players.
1941760	1945360	I've been trying to follow the campfire community with the screenshot system.
1945360	1946320	I don't know.
1946320	1949040	I can't tell because all the screenshots are in French.
1949760	1957120	So I think it looks like you kind of pick up players, you recruit players for a team,
1957120	1959760	and then you like maybe control courts.
1959920	1964560	You do like, because I've heard of things like three point shootouts and one on one
1964560	1965760	games that you play on the court.
1965760	1969120	But again, don't quote me on any of this because honestly, I don't fucking know.
1969120	1971360	And until I play the game for myself, I don't know.
1971360	1977040	I'll try it because I have fucking played every Niantic game and pretty much any AR
1977040	1978960	game that has come out, I will try it.
1979600	1984880	And I'll let you all know if it's worth crossing over if you don't usually play sports
1984880	1985280	games.
1985840	1988000	But I'm certainly curious.
1988080	1990240	So I hope they make the release this week.
1990240	1995680	I mean, don't hold them to it because that release date was in their campfire community
1995680	1997280	like before the end of the year.
1997280	2000640	They said they're going to launch globally on January 24th, which is Tuesday.
2000640	2002160	So we'll see if they do it or not.
2002160	2003120	So we'll see.
2004400	2007840	Philan9 says Rob is broing out right now.
2007840	2013760	I guess I didn't realize that I was actually talking to a friend about the NBA, another
2013760	2016720	friend that also plays Ingress and Pokemon is into all the games I am.
2017360	2023360	And I was like, if we get to be our own teams, I don't want to be the Kings.
2023360	2024320	Absolutely not.
2024320	2028800	Because living in Sacramento, everybody's going to be the Kings, or they're going to
2028800	2033360	be the Lakers because we have a lot of Laker fans here who love to, you know, but apparently
2033360	2036480	I didn't realize the Kings apparently are actually doing very well right now.
2036480	2037040	Relatively.
2037040	2038800	They're like third in the league right now.
2038800	2039840	I was like, what?
2039840	2041120	When did the Kings get a good team?
2041120	2042000	That's okay.
2042640	2043760	Weird timeline we're in now.
2043760	2045600	I know what's going on.
2045600	2048640	So I'm like, who's the last place team?
2048640	2049920	That's the team I'm going to pick.
2049920	2054960	So it looks like unless otherwise convinced I'll be the Detroit Pistons.
2054960	2056720	It sounds like so.
2057520	2058320	But I don't know yet.
2058960	2061760	Because honest to God, I was like, well, I'll do a city I like.
2061760	2064720	I said, I can be the Seattle SuperSonics, right?
2064720	2070720	And somebody straight had to sit me down and go, Rob, Seattle hasn't had a team since 2008.
2072640	2074000	This is your reality.
2074400	2075920	Oh, I'm like, wait, what?
2077360	2080320	Actually, Seattle tried to steal the Sacramento Kings.
2080320	2081360	I don't know if you're aware.
2082160	2082660	What?
2083280	2084160	Lots of people have.
2085280	2085780	So.
2086640	2088960	Anyway, I thought they were going to be the Vegas Kings for a while there.
2090160	2094000	Well, Vegas got their got our our football team instead.
2094000	2096960	But is that a blessing or a curse?
2099360	2100560	It depends who you ask.
2101280	2101780	All right.
2101780	2108500	Let's see, Mike Deaf says, I'm still waiting for him to get to level 50 in Pogo.
2108500	2112500	And SJ 100 Matt says, Rob's got to get his max level on every Niantic product.
2112500	2117860	Well, to be fair, you know who she who shall not be named made me stop playing that Harry
2117860	2119780	Potter wizards unite before they shut it down.
2119780	2121140	So I never did get max level on that.
2121140	2122500	I got to 30.
2122500	2125140	But that was about as far as I could get before I was like, I.
2126500	2127000	I can't.
2127940	2128660	It was that simple.
2129620	2132340	But I've I've been max level in Ingress.
2132340	2134660	I'll probably get max level in Pikmin eventually.
2134660	2135700	It's just walking.
2135700	2136200	I'll get there.
2137940	2142100	Pokemon is the tough thing is those level up gates.
2142100	2148980	I'm just too unmotivated to fight 50 Team Rocket leaders because you have to do things
2148980	2152180	that are very hard to multitask in those games.
2152180	2158020	Meaning I can't play like Ingress and Pikmin and because I've got to sit there and go,
2158020	2161700	here's a Team Rocket, stop, fight, fight, fight, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
2161700	2163140	Okay, here's the leader.
2163140	2165380	Stop, spit, tap, tap, tap, bite, bite, bite.
2165380	2168660	It's like I can't be bothered to do the level up quest.
2168660	2169380	That's my problem.
2170500	2171380	I'll get there eventually.
2171380	2171540	All right.
2171540	2173220	One other game I played this week and then I'll be done.
2173220	2176740	I promise the other game I played this week blast from the past.
2177300	2182500	Ikaruga I played because apparently it is free.
2182500	2186820	I don't know if it's still free right this moment, but in this morning it was free on
2186820	2192500	the Xbox Argentina store and specifically you have to be in the Argentina marketplace.
2192500	2193460	I don't know why.
2193460	2195780	I don't know if it's some sort of holiday or something.
2196740	2197300	Pardon me.
2197300	2199860	What is unique about Xbox Argentina?
2199860	2204340	But you can get it free in that store right now, or at least maybe somebody in chat will
2204340	2205380	fact check me live here.
2205380	2207860	I put the link on my Mastodon if somebody wants to check if it's still there.
2208900	2212260	But it was free.
2212260	2213380	It's not free on the US store.
2213380	2216500	It's like $3.29 or some price still right now.
2217780	2222340	But yeah, I grabbed that and I checked it out because even though it was an Xbox 360,
2222340	2228660	which obviously was a re-release of something for the Dreamcast, you can play it on series
2228660	2231540	SNX because it's one of the backwards compatible titles.
2231540	2233060	So looks great.
2234340	2234660	All right.
2235620	2240180	Mike Def says it's normally free there for some reason, like every month it goes free
2240180	2241620	on Xbox Argentina.
2241620	2242500	Interesting.
2242500	2246660	Well, today was the day that it caught my attention and I went and I was like, oh, sure
2246660	2247220	enough.
2247220	2250180	Even though I have a US account, I can click on that, redeem it.
2250180	2250820	And here I am.
2250820	2252100	I'm playing it on my Xbox.
2252100	2253220	So that was fun.
2253220	2253700	Cool.
2253700	2254200	Yep.
2254900	2257140	It's a hard fucking game too, by the way.
2257140	2261940	I mean, I know we all know that, but just to reiterate, Ikaruga, it's a hard fucking
2261940	2262580	game.
2262580	2262900	All right.
2262900	2263620	It is.
2263620	2264120	Yeah.
2264740	2264980	All right.
2264980	2267460	Well, you can get radiant silver gun for Switch.
2268260	2269620	Oh, yeah, that's true.
2269620	2271300	I haven't gotten anything on Switch in a while.
2271300	2275380	Not since Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which I still need to go back and beat.
2275380	2279060	I kind of let that wagon derail, but I keep hearing they're going to do patches.
2279060	2282420	So I'm like, maybe I'll just wait for the home patch at this point, which will probably
2282420	2284100	patch in a lot of performance stuff too.
2284900	2286740	Even though I wasn't super bothered by it.
2286740	2287140	I don't know.
2287140	2291700	There's something I'm like, if I know I'm not playing the game in its final form, I
2291700	2293220	get really weird about it.
2293220	2293720	I don't know.
2294580	2295080	All right.
2295940	2300740	Let's get into some other headlines and what's going on in the gaming world, including some
2300740	2302020	more bad news.
2302020	2302820	But I don't know.
2302820	2304180	This one I think we all saw coming.
2304740	2306020	Unexpected.
2306020	2309220	It's because it's Square Enix and Square Enix has.
2310340	2316020	A pattern of behavior when it comes to live service games, they like to cancel them after
2316020	2317140	not much support.
2317140	2324740	And so, you know, now I guess this is an Embracer group that owns it, but you know, I'm still
2324740	2327300	seeing this tainted by Square Enix, though.
2327300	2333220	So Marvel Avengers is ending all official support, and that's going to be in September.
2333220	2334180	So you still got some time.
2334180	2341220	You can still play some more of it, but they're going to be basically that update 2.8, which
2341220	2346820	comes out at the end of March 23rd, is going to be the end of the content and feature rollout.
2347540	2355220	And they're also saying that on September 30th, all official support will end and the
2355220	2361300	single player and multiplayer will still be available as well as some of the facets of
2361300	2361780	the game.
2361780	2365300	But there are going to be other parts that are shut down.
2365300	2367140	Credits will not be purchasable.
2367140	2370020	And I think the cosmetics are going to be made free.
2370020	2374740	And in case you're wondering for all of those out there that may not own a Sony copy of
2374740	2376580	this game, you're like, Hey, cool.
2376580	2377940	Do I get Spider-Man now?
2377940	2379300	No, you don't get Spider-Man.
2379860	2380660	Sorry.
2380660	2381700	Sony has Spider-Man.
2381700	2383300	They're never going to let you have Spider-Man.
2384180	2384680	That's it.
2384680	2391960	I wonder if it'll stay on Game Pass, even though they're getting rid of the because
2391960	2394360	you can't even buy a new digital copyright.
2394360	2398120	So I'm assuming that means it'll leave Game Pass, too, which is going to be interesting.
2398680	2400360	So, yeah, I don't know.
2400360	2404360	I mean, look, I'm not wishful thinking about Spider-Man.
2404360	2408920	I understand that's a Sony thing, but I like that I can play it on Game Pass without Spider-Man.
2408920	2411080	But I didn't play it a lot.
2411080	2412600	And so maybe I'm part of the problem.
2412600	2413080	I don't know.
2413960	2418840	Well, no, I think part of the problem is the fact that the game looked like it was a live
2418840	2421320	service game that shoehorned into a single player game.
2421320	2424120	Like, I think this was developed originally as like a single player game.
2424120	2427480	And they're like, we want more money.
2427480	2432280	And so they like shoved this like, really grindy end game into it.
2432280	2438360	And people just didn't like they used a beloved license to try to create a money machine.
2438360	2440040	And the whole thing was very transparent.
2440040	2441400	And everyone saw right through it.
2441400	2443640	That is the story of Marvel Avengers in a sentence.
2444200	2448520	And it was also, I think, rough around the edges, too, when it came out, if I remember correctly.
2448520	2454280	So once again, you know, rush this stuff to market so we can make as much money as possible.
2454280	2456120	And yeah.
2456120	2456620	Yeah.
2458040	2459960	I mean, look, I'll give them this.
2459960	2460520	I'll give them this.
2461320	2465160	At least it wasn't EA running the game because the game would have been shut down a year
2465160	2466840	and a half ago if it was EA running it.
2466840	2467960	So I'll give them this.
2468680	2470440	They really tried.
2470440	2471880	They really tried to make it happen.
2471880	2474200	I think if they didn't sell to the Embracer group,
2474760	2479240	if this game wasn't sold as part of that, I think it would have been shut down earlier.
2479240	2481800	I mean, look at like what Square Enix has shut down recently.
2481800	2487960	They had that Final Fantasy 7 game that it was like
2487960	2490920	The fact that you don't even know what the fuck it is, is very telling.
2490920	2496360	I know because it's a Final Fantasy 7 game, which means it has a complicated subtitle to it.
2496360	2499000	So it's like, I want to say all the breaks.
2499560	2501240	I don't even know if it's all the bravest or something like that.
2501240	2503080	But it was one of the ones that's like.
2504200	2505880	Oh, Mike Deft with a great point.
2505880	2506840	I'm still freaking bitter.
2506840	2508840	What happened to Chocobo GP?
2508840	2509560	That's a very good point.
2509560	2510280	Yeah, that too.
2510280	2510840	That too.
2510840	2511160	Yeah.
2511160	2515560	So it's just it's a pattern behavior from them.
2515560	2519400	Just don't buy into any of their live service games.
2519400	2523560	Like actually any company really wish the companies out there would like start treating
2523560	2527880	live service like loot boxes, like in the sense that it's like a bad word and just,
2527880	2529560	you know, people don't want it type of thing.
2531080	2531880	I don't know.
2531880	2533080	It's just it's annoying.
2533960	2537880	Fifth Dream in chat says, what's that prequel Final Fantasy game that's a souls like or
2537880	2539640	something that went nowhere?
2539640	2542440	I think you're referring to Strangers of Paradise.
2542440	2544440	Is that the one where the fuck chaos?
2544440	2546200	Is it that one that you're thinking of?
2547640	2551640	There's actually DLC coming out real soon for that, because I've been really tempted
2551640	2552520	to buy it.
2552520	2555320	But like, it won't go on sale enough.
2555320	2560760	I should have bought it on the stinkin epic store with the 25% off coupon that probably
2560760	2563480	is the best deal I was going to find for a while, but I forgot or I didn't do it.
2564120	2568200	Like I'm waiting for that game to really get a deep discount before I pick that up.
2568200	2569240	But I'm odd.
2569240	2573560	I thought the demo for Strangers of Paradise was special.
2574440	2577400	So it was a unique experience.
2577400	2578840	So I would try it again for sure.
2579880	2582120	So let's see.
2582760	2585880	DGRMS says, I'm waiting until that game drops to $20.
2585880	2588120	Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at as well, for sure.
2588120	2592360	So anyway.
2592360	2592680	Yep.
2592680	2595560	It's a bummer about what happened with the Marvel Avengers game.
2595560	2601160	But again, when you are that obviously transparent about trying to milk everyone for every dollar
2601160	2607560	in their wallets and every possible mini transaction you can in the game, this is what's going
2607560	2608040	to happen.
2608040	2612680	At least, you know, the fact they're unlocking all the cosmetics and stuff, I guess is cool.
2613240	2616760	But it's one of those might as well because they've made every dollar they're going to
2616760	2617560	make off that game.
2618520	2621240	Might as well show the fans who stuck with you some love, right?
2623080	2623880	All right.
2623880	2628280	Well, one game that's done very well for itself over the years is The Witcher 3.
2628280	2632600	I mean, hell, it lended itself to a television show, which yes, I know it's really about
2632600	2633560	the books.
2633560	2636920	But let's be real, the show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the games.
2637800	2644040	So The Witcher 3 and, you know, this game's come out several times and it's getting another
2644040	2647560	basically re-release because there's a next gen patch on the way.
2647560	2653960	The next gen patch for the PC is in final stages, as they say, whereas the console version
2653960	2657960	is actually going to be headed to retail and it's coming out on the 26th.
2657960	2662600	So The Witcher 3, and I almost said The Witcher 5 because I'm thinking PlayStation 5, but
2662600	2667240	The Witcher 3 next gen will be coming out for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox series
2667240	2669000	on January 26.
2669000	2670440	This is the complete edition.
2670440	2674840	This means all of the previous DLC is there and all the quality of life improvements and
2674840	2676520	all of that good stuff as well.
2677400	2680920	This does not mean the PC update is coming on the 26th.
2681480	2685720	The next gen patch is just at the final stages and they're saying it shouldn't be long before
2685720	2686680	it's out.
2686680	2690280	So whether that means one month, three months, we really don't know.
2690280	2692040	We're just at the mercy of them.
2692040	2693880	Bug testing, which, hey, you know what?
2694760	2696040	Don't release it half bait.
2696040	2696920	Get it right.
2696920	2699080	So I'm sure they've got it.
2699080	2701880	You know, if it is next gen, they got to make sure it still has decent performance and all
2701880	2702920	that stuff too.
2702920	2707240	But yeah, admittedly, I didn't play enough Witcher 3, but a next gen update will definitely
2707240	2710680	get me to take another look, especially, you know, I'm running kind of a nice rig on PC
2710680	2711080	now.
2711080	2715000	So whenever they get that PC version out, I'd love to play it.
2715000	2716040	I really would.
2716040	2717640	So I'll keep an eye on that.
2718440	2719320	All right, moving on.
2719320	2720040	Dark Sakura.
2720920	2731480	So I alluded to this before when we were talking about the layoffs and whatnot and community
2731480	2732040	support.
2733240	2738440	The Game Developers Conference released its annual video games industry report.
2739080	2744200	We have various statistics, but one of the ones on there is the illustrated the rise
2744200	2747480	of player driven harassment against game developers.
2748120	2755560	They said they were very confused about the toxicity of player bases, with 75% of developers
2755560	2759160	noting it was a very serious industry issue.
2759800	2764840	40% of developers claimed that they had faced direct harassment or as part of a team.
2766120	2775640	A portion of these respondents identified as members of the LGBTQIA plus or non male.
2776200	2785320	Or non male communities and different developers have come for different tactics, including
2786760	2794760	banning deplatforming the cruelest of them, which honestly I'm for.
2795960	2798920	Boundaries do very much need to be set.
2800920	2805320	But yeah, that's sort of like they're one of the quotes is ban, isolate and deplatform.
2805800	2813240	You know, others have also said, though, that studios need to have and this is a quote,
2813240	2818040	easily accessible hotlines for developers that are facing harassment to set proper
2818600	2822360	boundaries and stop inviting the community to be part of the family.
2826440	2830600	One developer was even saying that they had some death threats to their family.
2832040	2833800	None of that is acceptable people.
2833800	2834840	None of that.
2834840	2840760	But the biggest thing is at the core of what they want is unionization.
2841320	2847800	53% of the developers believe that they should unionize for protected rights.
2847800	2850360	Only 13% of the respondents disagreed.
2853160	2861080	And they're really just looking at overall protecting themselves, protecting their
2861320	2867560	their livelihoods and protecting their their safety, their mental health, too.
2868360	2870680	So and I'm going to say this right now.
2872120	2873880	Be critical of what you love.
2873880	2877960	It's the only way something can get better at the same time.
2877960	2879160	Don't be a little shit about it.
2879160	2881960	OK, that's unforgivable, right?
2881960	2889880	These are people doing their their jobs at the direction of other people.
2890600	2896920	And I mean, it's not like they're they're going around and, you know, like stabbing
2896920	2898360	people in the face or something.
2898360	2899800	No, if they were doing that.
2899800	2901000	Yeah, fuck drag them.
2901560	2905560	You know, if they were doing things that were causing harm to other people.
2905560	2906680	Yeah, drag them.
2906680	2907800	But they're making a game.
2909160	2916040	And just because you don't like the game or something about the game, it doesn't mean
2916040	2923720	that you can go out there and threaten someone's life or be that terrible to them about it.
2923720	2924760	It's just you just can't.
2925320	2927080	Same goes with like streamers.
2927080	2932040	Don't go attacking them because they don't play the game the way that you like them to
2932040	2937160	play it or or whatever, you know, or reality television stars on things like RuPaul's Drag
2937160	2937660	Race.
2938760	2943160	Just seeing all the hate people get on social media from that, too, is just unreal.
2943160	2948440	It's if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.
2949480	2955000	And if you can't be constructively and tactfully critical.
2956200	2957080	Keep it to yourself.
2958040	2959960	You there's paper.
2959960	2961400	These things exist called journals.
2962520	2963640	You can write it down there.
2963640	2965400	There is a void that you can shout into.
2966760	2971880	You can go to a forest where no one else is around and see if anyone can hear you if you,
2971880	2973000	you know, yell into it.
2973000	2974680	It's there's there's plenty of things you could do.
2975560	2978120	You could you could go find some dirt and bury your head in it.
2979640	2980440	Play Ostrich.
2981640	2982520	Exactly.
2982520	2983020	Exactly.
2983560	2987960	On a serious note, though, I one of those elements that you kind of said there about
2987960	2990680	kind of creating a support system for this.
2990680	2994360	I mean, it's sad that that we're at the point that we need one.
2994360	2996920	But recognizing that, yes, we need one.
2996920	3003320	I do kind of love the concept of perhaps a an employer's employee assistance program.
3003320	3008440	Many big employers, hell, even small and medium sized employers, many employers, probably
3008440	3013880	yours, offer some type of EAP or employee assistance program, which is usually a type
3013880	3021160	of mental health benefit because, you know, happy workers lead to productive workers.
3021160	3021400	Right.
3021400	3022360	And so forth.
3022360	3029960	But all of those semantics aside, I'm I would I would be surprised if these companies couldn't,
3029960	3035400	you know, put some of this wellness of how to deal with harassment into their employee
3035400	3036840	assistance programs.
3036840	3038120	So let's say help.
3038120	3041720	I'm being harassed on social media and like they're coming after my family.
3041720	3042440	What can I do?
3043000	3047240	Maybe there can be like a crisis support through some of these employee assistance, you know,
3047240	3052120	at their EA, at their Square Enix, wherever it is they work that can help them in getting
3052120	3052760	through that.
3052760	3055080	And, you know, support group, other people.
3055080	3057400	Here's what you can do to lock down your social media.
3057400	3059240	Here's, you know, what you should and shouldn't read.
3059240	3061560	And, you know, those those types of things to help them through it.
3062760	3067240	I would really like to call on I mean, I know nobody's fucking listening, but like you
3067240	3067720	all are.
3067720	3072440	But I mean, nobody influential in the industry is Bobby Kotick's not fucking listening.
3072440	3073160	Okay.
3073160	3078360	But I would throw out a challenge to the industry to, you know, and if it's not already in,
3078360	3082280	maybe some companies, I bet a lot of them do have something like this in their EAP.
3082280	3086200	But I would really like to call out to the gaming industry for their employee assistance
3086200	3086680	program.
3086680	3089160	A, if they don't have one, fucking get one.
3089160	3095320	B, embed within that program this type of support system because unfortunately, in the
3095320	3097240	year 20 and 23, it is needed.
3098120	3098680	That is it.
3099800	3102920	Ooh, this is the clapping emoji in chat.
3102920	3105080	So you know, this is serious for Mike Deft.
3105080	3108120	The same goes for localization teams.
3108120	3110840	Localization is not censorship.
3110840	3113480	Ooh, a thousand percent that, Mike Deft.
3113480	3116120	A hundred thousand percent that for sure.
3116680	3119800	Funara with a comment here, very important.
3119800	3123240	The problems you face in the game are not necessarily their fault.
3123240	3127800	And with all the layoffs and labor shortages, they may not have had the time or funds to
3127800	3128920	test any issues.
3128920	3129480	Yes.
3129480	3131640	Or I mean, hell, they probably did.
3131640	3135080	I mean, classic example, playing Skyrim.
3135960	3139080	Doesn't Bethesda fucking test these games?
3139080	3140440	Yeah, they do.
3140440	3144760	And honestly, that bug was probably found and it was reported.
3144760	3145640	And you know what?
3145640	3148360	It was determined that bug doesn't break the game.
3148360	3150520	The bug is not a, what do they call that?
3150520	3153480	A stage, a stage ender, a deal.
3153480	3156840	I don't remember what they call that in the industry, but it's something about, it's not
3156840	3158360	a, it doesn't cut off the game.
3158360	3159560	It doesn't end the game.
3159640	3162440	It's not a crisis basically thing.
3162440	3166040	So we're keeping it in to meet our deadline and we'll patch it up later.
3167160	3171560	That's not the testing team's fault, for sure.
3173000	3173800	Showstopper.
3173800	3174440	Thank you, Bobby.
3174440	3175160	That's what I was looking for.
3175160	3175800	Showstopper.
3177640	3181560	Sjo and Hunter Matt says, don't be upset or surprised when companies are reluctant to
3181560	3185400	show early footage of their game because they don't want to draw the ire of the internet
3185400	3186120	scum Lords.
3186760	3192200	Funara says, it's like trying to attack the people in a grocery store for supply shortages
3192200	3195000	or prices of industry-wide things like eggs.
3195000	3195560	Oh yeah.
3195560	3199960	Or God, when it was fucking toilet paper, like the people, you know, yelling at people
3199960	3203800	at Costco, like, like, like it's not their problem too.
3203800	3204360	It's not their fault.
3204920	3209160	It's not their, like those Costco employees are also probably trying to find toilet paper
3209160	3210200	or whatever it is.
3210200	3214440	They want the thing and they want you to know that they're selfish and want the thing.
3214840	3219960	I see this every day, even outside of just treating employees bad, just like with people
3219960	3223320	just choosing which laws that they want to follow, especially traffic laws.
3224040	3228760	The amount of people that run red lights near me, near a school is ridiculous.
3228760	3238360	And on top of that, other people aren't calling them out, you know, like, oh, I don't want
3238360	3239400	to get involved with that.
3239400	3240600	That doesn't involve me.
3240600	3242200	It does fucking involve me.
3242200	3243480	That doesn't involve me.
3243480	3245000	It does fucking involve you.
3245880	3253800	You know, you, as, as a society, we sort of, we do have a responsibility to each other
3253800	3257800	to make sure that the society that we're in functions properly.
3257800	3262040	And I will not hesitate to tell someone they're being a little shit to the employee who can't
3262040	3262920	do anything about it.
3264520	3267160	And I've done it in the middle of die.
3267160	3272520	So I have yelled at someone for not wearing their mask because the employee couldn't do
3272520	3273020	it.
3273560	3277240	I was like, do you not see that other people here have their masks on?
3277240	3279880	Get out, put your mask on, and then you can come back in.
3280440	3282840	I don't have to be nice to you because I'm not an employee.
3284120	3288520	And I'm sure they walked right out of the store and said, what a bitch, you know, but
3288520	3289720	it's like, oh, I don't care.
3289720	3290520	Yeah, exactly.
3290520	3291020	Good.
3292840	3294200	I'm also your worst nightmare.
3294200	3295480	Why don't you use that term too?
3297320	3302200	I, I, well, I mean, you know, I used to do it at, um, at golf land back in the day when
3302200	3303960	people were being assholes.
3303960	3305640	I have no problem with speaking up.
3306520	3313240	And if I see someone is being, you know, is harassing someone for their, their race or
3313240	3316360	their gender, you damn well better believe I'm going to say something.
3316360	3321880	And that's why this shit happens in the world because no one else stands up and says that's
3321880	3322520	enough.
3322520	3326680	That's, that's being an ally in those sorts of, it is up to
3327320	3334120	non LGBTQ plus people to say to their non LGBTQ plus people, friends, when a joke is, or the
3334120	3339560	FAG word is used or whatever it is, you know, or, or, uh, pronouns or somebody's, somebody
3339560	3343480	is saying it as a pronoun or one of those types of dirty things is happening.
3343480	3347320	It's up to those people to say, Hey, that's not funny.
3347320	3347800	That's not cool.
3347800	3348600	Don't do that.
3348600	3350840	Like what, why, why are you doing that?
3350840	3351720	On top of that?
3351720	3358440	I mean, I, I am, you know, I have to deal with people who are going, Oh, that's not
3358440	3359720	really an orientation.
3360360	3361720	It's like, yeah, it is.
3361720	3367320	Or having doctors try to prescribe me hormones because they think that being ace is a hormonal
3367320	3375000	disease, which is not, I check out fine, you know, or having, you know, people, you know,
3375000	3378920	what, after I converted saying, Oh, now you're a candidate for a gas chamber.
3379560	3380520	Oh, disgusting.
3381240	3386680	It's really disgusting, especially after, you know, you know, what ascended for the
3386680	3394440	four years and, and, and I'm just saying, you know, that it's, it's like, you know,
3394440	3395880	the things, and then they came for me.
3396680	3398440	Don't wait for them to come for you.
3399320	3400920	Don't let them come for anybody.
3402440	3403800	To try to lighten the mood a little bit.
3403800	3406680	Let me read this chat comment here because it's totally true.
3406760	3407400	Sj 100.
3407400	3410440	Matt says as an aside, don't pick a fight at a waffle house.
3410440	3411960	The employees will mess you up.
3411960	3413320	Fuck around and find out.
3413320	3415000	Yeah, that is true.
3417000	3421160	As a connoisseur of many a waffle house acts.
3421160	3421640	I do.
3421640	3422440	I do.
3422440	3423720	I completely understand.
3423720	3425640	We're never getting waffle house in California.
3425640	3431000	I also understand for those that live in California, waffle house gets severely overrated.
3431000	3433560	Like it's like the rest of you in and out to be quite frankly.
3433560	3435880	But it's, it's one of those issues.
3435880	3438120	I do wish we had waffle house in California.
3438120	3440840	Cause I'm going to tell you Denny's is not it.
3440840	3441480	Period.
3441480	3443080	Denny's is not it.
3443640	3448600	There's only one place I have eaten at that the food tastes just like it does a waffle house.
3448600	3452040	And that's that Ed's place in San Francisco over on Fillmore.
3453160	3454920	It's been open since 1972.
3454920	3459000	And they're probably just trying to emulate the waffle house strategy to be fair.
3459640	3464760	Honestly, I think I have a theory that it was open by somebody who had waffle,
3464760	3465960	who went to waffle houses.
3465960	3467400	Like I like this.
3467400	3468360	I'm going to make this.
3469720	3472280	And of course we all know about the waffle house index.
3472280	3474440	I mean, even the house is closed run.
3474440	3476360	Even though the food is pretty shit.
3476360	3479720	Like I'm just, you know, it's, it's, it's comfort food.
3479720	3481160	I understand, but it's pretty shit.
3481160	3481480	Comfort.
3481480	3484840	Look, Taco Bell food is shit too, but it's comfort food.
3484840	3485160	Okay.
3485160	3486840	So Taco Bell food is actual shit.
3487800	3489720	I don't care.
3489720	3491400	No, that's still taco all the way.
3491400	3493160	I will say, yeah.
3493160	3496600	Why would you ever go to Taco Bell when there's a Del Taco there on the same street?
3496600	3497000	Why?
3497000	3498520	I like what fifth stream says.
3498520	3501800	It's it's like a bar Wolverine would hang out in, but with hash browns.
3503560	3504040	I forgot.
3504840	3506680	I forgot what I was going to say about waffle house now.
3508200	3510040	The food is shit, but it's comforting.
3510040	3511720	And yes, it's exactly, it's comfortable.
3511720	3513000	It's in a comforting environment.
3513000	3518680	You, you know what you're going to fucking get at three in the morning at waffle house.
3519720	3521720	You know, the coffee is going to be hot.
3521720	3524280	They'll always put on a fresh pot for you.
3524280	3528040	You can get those hash brown covered smothered chunked, diced.
3529000	3531480	There's this and always order your waffle.
3531480	3532280	Well done.
3532280	3536360	There's this, there's a certain cadence to the, I mean, it's literally all in front of
3536360	3536520	you.
3536520	3539160	You can watch them make the fucking food from start to finish.
3539560	3541320	Not a lot of chains to do the food.
3541880	3543000	There's not a lot of chains to do that.
3543800	3546840	Throw a chair at a waffle house employee and they will parry it like Daigo.
3550600	3551100	True.
3551800	3552200	All right.
3552200	3553960	Anyway, let's see what else is there.
3553960	3558120	Bobby Black Wolf says a bag of waffle house grits in my pantry and I'm about to make them.
3558120	3561720	Bobby Black Wolf says we're soon getting in and outs in Tennessee in a few years.
3561720	3563480	So soon we won't care about it anymore.
3564040	3567480	It's like that fucking raising canes just opened up on every block here.
3567480	3571400	And at first it was like, wow, we're finally getting raising canes.
3571400	3574760	Literally, it's like three months later and it's like, okay, everybody stopped caring.
3576840	3579240	Well, they also have now came out here.
3581160	3582200	What, Loki?
3582200	3587880	I was going to say they also have now like, um, all the hot chicken, Nashville hot chicken
3587880	3592840	places before it used to be like, hey, ooh, national, uh, national proper.
3592840	3593880	Heck yeah.
3593880	3595320	I like I'm craving that.
3595320	3597320	And it's like, oh, hey, there's a restaurant, national tender.
3597880	3598520	I'll try that out.
3601960	3609400	Nashville, uh, nations, nations, like a Nashville hot.
3609400	3610120	Oh, got it.
3610120	3610360	Okay.
3610360	3610840	Okay.
3610840	3615080	It's, it's like fried chicken with like, they put it like way too much spice on it to where
3615080	3616920	it's like you just in torture.
3616920	3617560	I love it though.
3617560	3618040	It's great.
3618040	3623000	And he's, you know, serve it on a piece of, uh, white bread and pickles and stuff.
3623000	3624280	You know, it's good stuff.
3624840	3625480	Chicken stress.
3625480	3628360	But, um, they have like now Dave's hot chicken.
3628360	3631880	There's like all like so many hot chicken places now.
3633320	3635400	And they're not all of them are great.
3635400	3639000	Oh, I want crystals so I can eat my corn pups in peace.
3639000	3643640	Here's what you should all be jealous of on the East coast that you don't have that we
3643640	3643960	have.
3643960	3644920	It's a newer thing.
3644920	3649160	And I'm telling you, this place is addicting AF and I'm sure my co-hosts are going to roll
3649160	3649640	their eyes.
3649640	3650200	I don't care.
3650760	3652920	I think the thing y'all are missing is Dutch brothers.
3653480	3658680	That my eyes are rolling so far that I'm going to fall out of my chair.
3658680	3661720	Like I love me too.
3661720	3667320	It's it's and yeah, I say that as I'm not drinking Dutch brothers on stream, but it's
3667320	3670760	because because the drive-throughs are always a fucking you think in and out drive-through
3670760	3671320	lines are long.
3671320	3672600	Go to a fucking Dutch brothers.
3672600	3673080	Jesus.
3673880	3676600	Dutch brothers are to the coffee world.
3676600	3678600	What Apple is to the technology world.
3678600	3679880	You'll have people that just.
3683880	3686200	I'm like why the people that purchase their products?
3686200	3686600	Hold on.
3686600	3688920	Let me describe what you're saying on my iPhone.
3688920	3689320	Yes.
3689320	3690120	What were you saying?
3691400	3694200	What I'm saying is overrated.
3694200	3695720	My iPhone is a webcam.
3697400	3701320	They insist they insist on placing their plopping down their stupid businesses.
3701320	3702680	I say plop because it's shit.
3703560	3708520	They plop it down in like the most inconvenient places ever because it's the size of like
3708520	3709400	one of those photos.
3709960	3712200	This is probably predating a lot of people.
3712200	3712680	Sorry.
3712680	3714680	You kids know what a photo booth is?
3714680	3714840	Yeah.
3714840	3717080	Do you know what a photo booth is?
3717080	3717720	A photo mat?
3717720	3717960	Yeah.
3717960	3720360	Where you know they can drive through photo mat.
3720360	3723800	Those photo booths now will post to your Facebook automatically.
3723800	3725000	That's the new thing they all do.
3725640	3725880	Okay.
3725880	3730200	Well, this is a drive-through photo mat like back when we had film cameras.
3730200	3730920	Okay.
3730920	3733000	And so they're like that size.
3733000	3734600	Like the small checkers.
3734600	3739560	Think of think of like the size of your utility shed in the backyard or something like that.
3739560	3743640	They converted that into a coffee place and decided to park it in the middle of a parking
3743640	3743880	lot.
3743880	3745800	And so there's no adequate...
3745800	3751320	They have drive-through lines going two different directions sometimes or it's just weaving
3751320	3755960	through everywhere and blocking everything because they're ill-prepared to serve the
3755960	3759560	amount of customers that they have because they don't have a storefront because I guess
3759560	3762440	that costs too much or it's not like cool enough.
3762440	3767800	And then the worst part about it, and don't get me wrong, like I'm sure their coffee is
3767800	3770440	good and I have no problem with the coffee.
3770440	3775400	What I have a problem with is the people that go there and then decide, hey, you know what
3775400	3775960	we're going to do?
3777080	3782840	I'm going to put a crap ton of your products, advertising, bumper stickers all over the
3782840	3785080	fuck my van and my car.
3785080	3788200	I see that shit fucking everywhere and it's really annoying.
3789240	3791320	Too expensive for me to put stickers all over it.
3791320	3791560	Okay.
3791560	3794920	I'll say what they did to tie it back to video games.
3794920	3797720	They've stolen the Xbox achievement system for their app.
3797720	3802360	And I know like Alan actually is like, oh, if I go today, I can get like a heart sticker
3802360	3802840	for my eyes.
3802840	3806280	It's not even a real sticker, but apparently if you go on the first of the month, they
3806280	3807400	do give you a real sticker.
3807960	3808920	So that's a thing.
3808920	3809720	Anyway.
3809720	3810360	Oh my gosh.
3810360	3810760	Okay.
3810760	3813720	So they're the kindergarten class of like coffee places.
3814920	3816120	Low-key, they're so good.
3816120	3818200	Say this as I have an actual sticker book.
3818200	3820280	And you can get non-coffee drinks there too.
3820280	3822840	And they're not even paying me to say this, but they should pay me in coffee.
3822840	3823560	Jesus.
3823560	3827320	But you can get like energy drinks and non-coffee things there too.
3827320	3827640	Yeah.
3827640	3829080	I know that they have stuff.
3829080	3833320	I've gone there and gotten a coffee before, but like I will never do it again.
3833320	3834360	Torani Syrup Bar.
3834360	3835320	That's all that place is.
3835320	3840280	But anyway, just a couple of comments in chat here on the food, and then I'm going to move
3840280	3840520	on.
3840520	3846280	Number one, Pod Culture in chat says White Castle greater than Crystal's?
3846280	3847240	Crystal's.
3847240	3848280	I almost said Crystalis.
3848280	3849720	I would love a White Castle.
3850040	3855480	I've never actually had like IRL White Castle other than like the microwave stuff.
3855480	3859960	White Castle is the most disgusting fucking fast food I've ever had in my life.
3859960	3863240	That is the most, like you could not have a more wrong opinion.
3864280	3865400	Sorry, Pod Culture.
3865400	3866200	I don't know Crystal's.
3866200	3869160	So maybe, but that was, I had it in Vegas.
3869160	3870280	That was disgusting.
3870280	3875000	Crystal is kind of the same theory as White Castle, but I always have to tell them not
3875000	3878120	to put any mustard or pickle on my sandwich.
3878200	3884280	But they have an amazing thing on their menu that I greatly miss, and that is the Corn
3884280	3887240	Pup is tiny little corn dogs.
3887240	3888600	Oh, that's tiny little corn dogs.
3889160	3892200	It's just the steaming of the burger.
3892200	3893560	No, no.
3894600	3899400	I remember when we were so desperate to get Dunkin Donuts, and we have one near us now,
3899400	3905400	and I really wish it was Krispy Kreme instead, because I don't like Dunkin.
3906360	3912200	I love Dunkin Donuts because I can get more cake-style donuts rather than what they had
3912200	3913000	at Krispy Kreme.
3913560	3918280	And I grew up with freaking Krispy Kreme, and I'm very sad that the one from the 50s
3918280	3921800	that was on Government Street in Mobile is gone.
3922360	3923480	Pisses me the fuck off.
3924040	3931480	But I like, when I came out here and had donuts that were not from Krispy Kreme for the first
3931480	3937560	time in my life, I was like, cake donuts, a lot of cake donuts.
3937560	3943720	Yeah, I will say the food at Krispy Kreme is better than Dunkin, but the coffee is better
3943720	3945240	at Dunkin than it is at Krispy Kreme.
3945240	3950040	But you're right, that is the one thing that California seemingly has that I do notice
3950040	3953320	is that because we don't have a lot of Krispy Kreme and Dunkin, there's a lot of mom and
3953320	3954760	pop donut shops.
3954760	3957240	And I will say, nothing beats those.
3957240	3959480	Nothing beats those for donuts.
3960200	3965400	I do like, I really do like, though, they're just regular glazed donuts.
3965400	3968200	So like the Krispy Kreme ones, I could eat those like by the dozen.
3968200	3976360	But that's the thing I missed about the one on Government Street, because it had the conveyor
3976360	3977480	in the back where they cooked them.
3978200	3979320	Oh, that was awesome.
3979320	3982120	And you go in when the hot sign is on.
3982120	3983960	And that was when they were the best.
3983960	3988680	Yeah, we had one by the mall, and then it became a Panera Bread.
3988760	3993400	What was the big chain that was at Winchell's that used to be all over California?
3993400	3997320	Now, I think they're only in Southern California, but most mom and pop shops are pretty much
3997320	4002120	Winchell's are pretty much that, like, is that it's pretty much what all mom and pop
4002120	4004840	stores are modeled after.
4004840	4007400	Okay, there was one other food comment because I had to get to it.
4007400	4008040	And now I don't.
4008040	4009160	Oh, dang, where was it?
4009160	4011080	So y'all are going off on food.
4011080	4013960	I'm like, do we spend too much time talking about food on this show?
4013960	4015800	And then like, y'all blow up the chat.
4016600	4020040	Yeah, see, Fifth Dream says, I like Dairy Queen food.
4020040	4021800	I'm not going to lie.
4021800	4022520	It's so bad.
4022520	4027400	But where else can you get country gravy, Texas toast with chicken strips?
4027400	4028440	That's a good idea.
4028440	4035400	The only thing I don't like about Dairy Queen, and this is just it saddens me so much.
4035960	4040600	So Dairy Queen purchased Orange Julius, and then Orange Julius disappeared out of the
4040600	4043560	malls, and they used to have Orange Julius available at Dairy Queen.
4043560	4045000	Now they don't have it at all.
4045000	4047000	They have made Orange Julius extinct.
4047000	4048600	And that makes me so sad.
4048600	4049800	This word did used to be good.
4049800	4052440	Okay, the comment was from Mike Deft.
4052440	4055960	And it was a response to we were talking about Taco Bell and Del Taco.
4055960	4058360	And he said something along the lines of it's all shit.
4059960	4060520	What did he say?
4060520	4064440	Oh, all of those Mexican fast food are shit with Mexican in quotes.
4064440	4068520	And that is from our resident listener that actually lives in Mexico.
4068520	4071960	Unless it's Jim Boys, and then it just gives you the shits.
4071960	4075240	Here's the thing about Taco Bell and Del Taco and all that.
4075240	4077640	Taco Bell is not Mexican food.
4077640	4078600	It is Taco Bell.
4081240	4082360	You have to go into it.
4082360	4083960	Taco Bell is not Mexican food.
4083960	4085000	It's just not food.
4085000	4086760	It's Southern California food.
4086760	4090120	If I want something that resembles Mexican food, I would go to, like, Chando's Tacos
4090120	4093400	or something that is a lot more like authentic street taco type of fare.
4093400	4096040	Well, Chando's is extremely greasy.
4096040	4100040	Near my house, but I cannot eat at Jim Boys because it makes me immediately sick.
4100200	4102600	Jim Boys is one of the...
4102600	4105400	It's honestly my first week out here.
4105400	4106760	Dan took me to Jim Boys.
4108600	4109320	I'll leave it at that.
4109320	4112920	When Shane lived with us for a little bit, we went to Jim Boys one day and Shane was like,
4112920	4114200	never again.
4115800	4116360	That was me.
4116360	4117080	Jim Boys.
4117080	4117400	I know.
4117400	4117960	I love Jim Boys.
4117960	4119000	Their tacos are good.
4119000	4119480	I don't know.
4119480	4120120	All right.
4120120	4120600	But Chando's...
4120600	4123800	I thought I had a cast iron digestive system.
4123800	4124760	No, I don't.
4124760	4128600	Chando's is good, except for their...
4128600	4132040	Like, I used to get their, like, kind of stuffed quesadillas that they have.
4132040	4135240	And it's just like, it's just grease.
4135240	4136840	It's solid grease.
4136840	4137560	That's the only thing.
4137560	4139240	It's like so heavy and so bad.
4139240	4147560	And then they also have their street corn, which I love Elodie, but it's sour.
4148280	4151160	Like, I don't think it's supposed to be sour.
4151160	4153240	Like, it's not good sour.
4153240	4157400	I've had a lot of street corn from a different bunch of different places, and it's sour,
4157400	4158600	like sour milk.
4159640	4159960	All right.
4160920	4163160	Clearly, we've derailed with Orange Challenge Fudio.
4163160	4163960	Let's try to get back.
4163960	4165960	Hey, look, what do we do when we play video games?
4165960	4166760	We eat.
4166760	4172520	Let's move on into some other gaming headlines, which, you know, kind of along the lines of
4172520	4174920	harassment a little bit and social media behavior.
4174920	4175480	I don't know.
4175480	4175980	Loki?
4178120	4178680	Yeah.
4178680	4187640	So, of course, we have Phil Spencer saying that he's praising devs for releasing games
4187640	4191320	among the culture of cancellation.
4192040	4195080	So first, when I read this, like, I wasn't sure if they were talking about, like, you
4195080	4200520	know, all the different canceled games like Ubisoft and stuff, but they're talking about
4200520	4203160	the current culture of criticism and cancellation.
4204040	4209720	I guess being that indie developers are more likely to just kind of bring their vision
4209720	4213480	to fruition and not really care about outside influences.
4213480	4217480	Whereas if you have something kind of studio made or something like that, you might get
4217480	4220600	a lot more exec kind of influence over stuff.
4221240	4228120	But basically, we are we all of us here today, all of our teams around the globe, separate
4228120	4229320	the 10,000 people that we let go.
4229880	4233000	We are all part of creating this echo effect of joy.
4233880	4238280	Bravely and intentionally release their visions to the world, particularly in the current
4238280	4245480	culture of criticism and cancellation, our players who bravely and intentionally carve
4245480	4250520	out time for games to invite rest and rejuvenate their lives and business leaders.
4250520	4253880	We call upon them and have the courage to protect and nurture this collective joy.
4253880	4257080	I think what they're talking about mainly was like some of the more recent games like
4257080	4261720	High on Life is a weird game and that they just kind of, you know.
4263080	4264200	Let it be weird, I guess.
4266040	4267640	I mean, here's the thing.
4267640	4271080	I actually don't think Phil Spencer's comments are as terrible as people are making them
4271080	4273080	out to be, and maybe I'm giving him too much credit.
4273640	4274440	But here's the thing.
4274440	4278600	I think like when I was reading this story on some websites, like for I'm just to say
4278600	4282120	say what it is like when I was reading the headline on Kotaku, I noticed they changed
4282120	4285560	the quote to remove the word criticism and they just put the cancellation.
4285560	4291560	And I felt when I was reading that story that they were trying to project like the Hogwarts
4291560	4294600	Legacy discussion because that's the ongoing cancellation right now, right?
4294600	4298040	They were trying to project that onto Phil Spencer's comments.
4298920	4305560	But when I read Phil Spencer's comments as a standalone, I more see it in light of the
4305560	4309880	story Jamie just talked about and a lot of the crap that developers have to put up with
4309880	4310760	online.
4310760	4314520	And sometimes, yeah, I would actually label some of that like cancellation.
4314520	4316360	It's shitty cancellation attempts.
4316360	4322920	It's cancellation that's just, you know, and we all know that's a silly word anyway.
4322920	4326200	A lot of it is accountability culture and so forth anyway.
4326200	4327400	But I digress.
4327400	4328760	I don't want to get too far into those.
4328760	4335160	I just feel like when I was reading a lot of the gaming media's reports on this quote
4335160	4339960	that they were projecting something onto it that I don't think Phil, unless Phil Spencer
4339960	4348120	said like Hogwarts Legacy or like what other, unless he said that, I'm not sure I would
4348120	4351000	jump from this to this in that conclusion.
4351000	4351720	Maybe I'm wrong.
4351720	4353080	Maybe I'm being naive.
4353080	4355080	Maybe I'm giving Phil Spencer too much credit.
4355080	4357960	I feel like he's earned a little bit of credit from some of the things he's done in this
4357960	4358460	industry.
4359400	4363960	But, you know, and also not everybody always says eloquent things.
4363960	4368680	I can respect developers and still say, oh boy, did you put your foot in your mouth?
4368680	4373080	For example, Naoki Oshida and the comments about Final Fantasy 16.
4373080	4381320	I respect the guy a lot, but oof, you know, but I also recognize how much of that is him
4381320	4383960	and how much of that is like the Japanese game development industry.
4383960	4385400	But that's a whole other Oprah.
4387080	4390600	I just think this, you know, I don't know.
4390600	4395480	I feel like a different argument is being put on Phil Spencer that I'm not sure he was
4395480	4396600	trying to get involved with.
4397560	4399160	But that's my thought.
4400840	4403240	Anyway, all right, moving on.
4403240	4409160	Let's talk about Arcade 1UP because, you know, we talk about those machines on this show
4409160	4409880	a little bit.
4409880	4413320	And we also talk about them on our Discord server sometimes because, you know, some of
4413320	4415800	these pictures of machines and stuff show up on our Discord.
4416440	4421160	Plus, you know, the good old I'm banned from Bobby Black Wolf's arcade because I get high
4421160	4422600	scores on his machines.
4422600	4426120	This all gets elaborated on with pictures in the Discord and all of that.
4426200	4431240	So over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4431240	4436600	This story was actually posted in the Orange Launch Radio channel about did Arcade 1UP
4436600	4439560	actually violate an emulator license?
4439560	4442280	And it was a link to a Reddit post in the emulation subreddit.
4443000	4444200	But it reads this.
4444200	4451400	The Arcade 1UP Simpsons Bowling Unit is reportedly based on Duck Station, which is a GPL3 licensed
4451400	4452600	product project.
4452600	4456760	I've looked around and there doesn't appear to be historic versions under any other license.
4456760	4461400	They are actively denying requests for the source code, which when the GPL requires for
4461400	4462920	them to make it available.
4462920	4467080	I was also sent similar via DM by someone else who requested the source.
4467960	4471000	I was told before that Arcade 1UP had cleaned up their act.
4471000	4474920	They had previously been caught using non-commercial versions of MAME in their products.
4474920	4477160	But based on this, it seems it's not the case.
4477160	4480840	Based on what has been said, this is nothing more than another bootleg product claiming
4480840	4481720	to be fully licensed.
4482360	4483400	Interesting development.
4483400	4486200	And by the way, thank you 13X Forever who posted that in our Discord.
4486200	4491640	But interesting development that came up since that was posted, actually, within the last
4491640	4497800	couple of days, Arcade 1UP, if you go to their GitHub over at github.com slash Arcade 1UP,
4497800	4499000	they have posted the source.
4500520	4507080	So calling them out, actually, they were in the position where, oops, I guess they were.
4507080	4508360	So I guess it is an admission.
4508360	4512280	Yes, we were using the duck station, which I'm sure it wasn't too hard to figure it out.
4512280	4515960	And they posted the source code.
4515960	4521480	So here's the completely fair dragging of Arcade 1UP.
4521480	4524760	And, you know, obviously that was a little shady what they did and so forth.
4525560	4529800	And a lot of people, you know, I've been read sometimes for buying these things because
4529800	4532200	it's like, why don't you why don't you mod these things?
4532200	4533640	You could get more games in him.
4533640	4537000	Or why do you not get the real cabinet or anything like that?
4537000	4542280	And it's like, yeah, I will number one, the real cabinets are a bitch to get upstairs.
4542280	4543640	And that's where my games are.
4543640	4544920	I'm moving a pinball.
4544920	4548120	Yeah, it's these work a lot better upstairs.
4548120	4551880	Let's let's put that or downstairs in the case of Black Wolf Manor.
4553080	4555400	These games get up and downstairs a lot easier.
4555400	4558680	But also be I realize they're not the real thing.
4558680	4563000	They're collectibles, especially this BurgerTime machine is limited edition 3000.
4563000	4564040	It is a collectible.
4564680	4566600	I like the aesthetic.
4567640	4571960	I think these, especially the Tron one with the built in black lights, like it looks really
4571960	4572600	cool.
4572600	4576280	I realize it's not the real thing with the real CRT television, all that.
4576280	4581240	But you know what, when those machines break, they are a fucking beast to repair because
4581240	4584040	no one makes CRT televisions anymore.
4584040	4588920	So I find these things as a kind of a happy kind of medium for collecting and so forth.
4588920	4591560	So but I want them to follow all the rules.
4591640	4596280	Like I don't I understand that a lot of this stuff is going to be emulated in this day
4596280	4596780	and age.
4597480	4603320	But emulations come a long way from the days of the earliest main main stuff and all that
4603320	4607560	stuff is like, you know, this is when I play this Tron machine, I feel like I'm playing
4607560	4613640	the old arcade game, save for the joystick is a little less durable than what you'd see
4613640	4614600	in the real arcade machine.
4614600	4619080	But other than that, the game itself, I feel like I'm playing the real game and it's a
4619080	4619580	lot of fun.
4620300	4622860	I still want the Marvel pinball from arcade one up.
4624860	4627580	Even though it's a digital pinball, I still think it would be funny.
4627580	4628220	It's still cool.
4629260	4632860	So Bobby Black Wolf says in the case of Black Wolf Manor, there's no stairs.
4632860	4634700	We take them around the house in the basement door.
4634700	4635580	That's Oh, that's right.
4635580	4638060	I forgot you have a back a backyard door.
4638060	4638380	That's right.
4638380	4639980	That's how you get the pinball machines in there.
4639980	4640700	Of course.
4640700	4641200	All right.
4642220	4646300	Dejirama S says you could get an arcade mini cab with tons of arcade games in it, but that's
4646300	4647580	bootleg AF.
4647580	4652780	And Rama, I'm going to really ruffle feathers with this comment, but that's my opinion.
4653980	4656780	Most of those cabinets look bootleg as fuck.
4656780	4659260	That's why I like these.
4660220	4664460	To me, especially this Tron one is incredibly faithful to the original, about as close as
4664460	4668220	you can get when it's three quarters of the size of the old one.
4668220	4672540	You know, a lot of those other machines, they look like bootleg arcade machines to me.
4673100	4675100	That's not to say I'll never get one.
4675100	4679980	Again, I keep pointing out I have a nice open available space still.
4680940	4681980	And you know what's funny?
4683100	4687820	Alan and I have even talked about like, you know, we don't really use the kitchen table.
4687820	4691100	And if we got rid of the kitchen table, we'd have more space downstairs.
4692540	4693260	Rob, what?
4694220	4698140	Tell me if you remember, we had the dining room table in my house.
4698700	4703180	Do you know what's been since put away in favor of pinball tables?
4703180	4704380	The dining room table.
4704460	4705100	dining room table.
4706140	4709340	We have we have a smaller kitchen table and even that's a gaming table.
4709340	4710860	It's a bumper pool underneath it.
4710860	4715820	But like, but your house is you and Dan, my house, me and Alan.
4715820	4721420	How often do we sit down at the dinner table and have dinner with our significant other
4721420	4722140	to talk about?
4722940	4723580	It doesn't happen.
4724220	4725020	We do.
4725020	4728380	Well, sometimes we might go out to eat and do that or something.
4728380	4730700	Or we might both sit in the living room and chat.
4730700	4732380	We don't like sit at the dinner table.
4732380	4733420	How do you do it?
4733420	4734620	You got rid of your dinner table.
4734620	4735420	You can't do it.
4735420	4737580	No, we have the we have the kitchen table.
4737580	4739900	Oh, yeah, you have your little one that's got the bumper pool in it.
4739900	4741340	Yeah, I remember eating pizza there once.
4742300	4742700	Yeah.
4742700	4746140	And so we have we have people over and we eat at the table, you know.
4747420	4752380	But like we were even talking about like, I kind of want to, you know, put that somewhere
4752380	4758460	else and get like one of those little folding leaf tables that you could just unfold the
4758460	4763020	one side and then have like a little nook area and then have the rest of the kitchen
4763020	4763520	open.
4763980	4767500	I like to our very first house, the house I grew up in, we had a instead of a kitchen
4767500	4770060	table, we had an actual like restaurant booth.
4770060	4771740	We had a like a booth.
4771740	4772380	I like that.
4773340	4775020	The one thing I don't like about those.
4775020	4778540	I'm just just saying is that if someone in the middle has to get up and pee.
4780140	4780700	Yeah, true.
4781740	4782240	Yeah.
4782620	4783900	And then they're kind of a pain to clean.
4784860	4785360	All right.
4785980	4787260	Anyway, let's move on.
4787260	4789500	Uh, following up on something from last week, right?
4789500	4790000	Dark soccer.
4791260	4791760	Yep.
4792720	4797920	This makes me actually kind of upset because.
4800960	4804160	Bubba is still in dead by daylight.
4804720	4810800	That code piece was put in the PTB to catch the leaker.
4812160	4813360	Oh, wow.
4814720	4815280	But there I go.
4815280	4816480	My Jennifer Coolidge again.
4816480	4818880	I didn't know that that's what it was.
4818880	4820560	Oh, I just I just okay.
4820560	4821060	I agree.
4824240	4827200	It's you still see Steve, Nancy and demo.
4827200	4828000	You would have seen Bubba.
4828000	4829360	You'd never truly be rid of Bubba.
4829360	4833440	Yeah, that was that was the theory is that they would just leave him in, but no one could
4833440	4834320	buy him again.
4834320	4839120	Like even I was talking when I was playing with Raven early this morning, you know, she
4839120	4842160	was even like, I was going to wait for I didn't I don't have Bubba yet.
4842160	4844160	I was going to wait for him to go on sale before they got rid of him.
4844160	4845280	And now they're not getting rid of him.
4845840	4855280	But yeah, it was actually posted on the Dead by Daylight Twitter dead by behavior BHVR.
4856400	4858880	Yeah, he's not going anywhere with a picture.
4860000	4866400	And of course, that picture being here, I'll actually just link the tweet with the photo.
4868640	4871920	At least for those in chat, other people, you'll have to look for it.
4871920	4872420	Sorry.
4872980	4877700	It's basically Dwight on a elf Dwight on a hook with a Bubba in the background.
4878900	4881460	Ready to go, because face camping Bubbas.
4882980	4888420	But yeah, they said, nope, he still got business to take care of in the entities realm.
4888420	4891460	We'll let you know if a licensed character ever needs to leave us.
4893300	4897780	But this was, you know, when they did the confirmation with leaks by Daylight.
4898500	4904500	They they actually said that that they were I mean, they've been very accurate over so many
4904500	4908660	things like outfits and whatnot, and collaborations.
4908660	4913780	Oh, and the person that runs it apparently said that they were just gonna stop posting
4914580	4915540	content leaks.
4916900	4920180	Like just basically stick with like the wardrobe stuff or whatever.
4920180	4922100	And I'm like, let's just knock it off.
4922820	4934340	But this is an attempt to try to catch some of the people who were leaking.
4934340	4936980	But in this case, I mean, it was actually just PTB data mining.
4939860	4949380	But there was another thing on here from Reddit, where they said that they,
4950100	4960900	they said that they gave a comment to a few of the different people they suspected of leaking.
4963940	4967380	Basically, this was set up like one of those canary traps,
4968260	4971300	you know, put the false information out there, find who leaked it.
4971300	4971860	Interesting.
4972020	4981300	Um, so, and then, yeah, I mean, and but there's the one person who said seems like this is the
4981300	4986580	end of this trip from MGA 9678 on a Reddit discussion.
4989460	4994660	But I mean, I do kind of agree with what another Reddit user said.
4994660	4998100	And I'll quote if this brings back some of the excitement and mystery around
4998100	5000100	chapter teasers again, that it's not all bad.
5002660	5007940	Um, but I mean, I like I like seeing this.
5007940	5011780	It makes me more excited for it when I get to see the preview of it, you know?
5011780	5012280	Yeah.
5012820	5020740	Um, I, I like those things, although I did kind of liked when, when they were teasing
5020900	5031940	uh, uh, the Hell Priest Cenobite, that they put up the footage in the, um, in, uh, on the TV.
5032500	5038740	And for anyone who's seen Hellraiser, they know that that's what the precursor
5039700	5042180	to, um, the Hell Priest showing up.
5042180	5042680	Yeah.
5043940	5047140	Yeah. So I like, or when they did the artist, we were all like,
5048100	5052340	like some of us knew right away, oh, that's going to be something you have to do with like artwork
5052340	5053060	or something.
5053060	5059540	And, you know, and even going back to like naming certain artists who had done this kind of work,
5059540	5065780	it was, I liked, I liked when we had those kinds of teasers and guesswork and to see who was right
5065780	5069940	and who wasn't and, you know, building up that excitement for it.
5069940	5075540	But I also did like every so often having someone vindicated or not vindicated, but confirm it for
5075540	5076740	me a little early, you know?
5077700	5080900	I don't think the leaks ever really like hurt anyone or the game.
5080900	5082740	Like, you know, the design does that plenty.
5083620	5086260	But it broke my heart because I want Bubba gone.
5087220	5089940	So people won't stop playing face camping asshole Bubbas.
5089940	5091700	He was never going to get fully removed.
5091700	5093620	They're not going to be able to take it from people that already bought it.
5093620	5095300	Like that would be very challenging.
5096020	5105140	I still think that they need to implement my idea, patent pending, of, um, having it like,
5106100	5113060	like for camping killers, having them be pushed out of the area or giving a longer endurance boost,
5113780	5116900	not just to the hooked, but to the unhooker.
5116900	5117300	I agree.
5117300	5121460	The hook timer in the post hook endurance timer should be based off of the proximity
5121460	5122820	of the killer and how long they stood.
5122820	5128020	Like if, if the killer stands right next to the hook, it should basically build the hook
5128020	5129940	time the longer the killer standing there.
5130580	5137940	I will say, however, that that has won many a match for people who have been hooked near
5137940	5138580	the exit gates.
5140260	5140580	All right.
5141780	5142900	Uh, let's move on.
5143780	5146740	The hook timer should stop if the killer is not out of the area.
5146740	5147380	No, I agree.
5148340	5149700	All right, let's move on.
5149700	5152580	Let's, uh, talk about some more, uh, I guess followups.
5152580	5156020	Cause I feel like we were talking about this company the other week, but Loki.
5156020	5156260	Yeah.
5156260	5160500	We were talking about cancellations by Ubisoft last week and some unknown games and stuff.
5160500	5165300	One of these, of course, was apparently an online hero battler called Project Q.
5165940	5168980	It was one of those three games that got, uh, canceled.
5168980	5172100	The one we talked about that last week, uh, because they have,
5172980	5176100	haven't been having a successful year apparently.
5176740	5178740	Um, and then confirmed it.
5178740	5179060	Yes.
5179060	5184180	Project Q development team was being reassigned to other endeavors and projects within the studio.
5184820	5189860	And I guess it was a PvP shooter first announced in April, 2022.
5189860	5191620	I don't remember anything about it.
5192420	5193700	So neat.
5193700	5201460	Um, and then of course they still insist that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development.
5203860	5205540	Duke Nukem forever all over again.
5207620	5208180	Yeah, I know.
5208180	5211140	I wonder how many times it will be great when it comes out.
5211140	5211620	I'm sure.
5212260	5216100	I wonder how many times it stopped and started development in that too.
5216100	5216820	Turned it over.
5216820	5217060	Yeah.
5217940	5219700	It's that happened at least once.
5219700	5224020	Cause when they started developing that game, they were probably developing it for the PS3.
5224020	5227140	I think it's been like 15 years now or something.
5227140	5227380	Yeah.
5227380	5228660	15 years.
5228660	5232820	So I really don't care at this point.
5232820	5235700	Just like either release or don't like, I don't care.
5235700	5238740	Just, I don't need to be told that it's still in development.
5239300	5241380	Or just tell me you canceled it and restarted it.
5241380	5242100	You know?
5242100	5242500	Yeah.
5242500	5246260	Just say, hey, we just started development because we had the cancel development.
5248660	5249300	Yeah, whatever.
5250020	5254020	Well, something else that was canceled before it ever started was Walu Peach.
5255140	5255860	That's right.
5256980	5263300	It was, uh, I guess Walu Peach was a character that had been pitched, uh, in a tweet.
5263300	5263700	Let's see.
5263700	5269780	It was an interview with Shugo Takahashi, uh, about the creation of Waluigi, uh, and
5269780	5272580	talking about, you know, what was going on with the creation of that.
5272580	5278100	But apparently, uh, Nintendo was open to other ideas and they, the team tried to pitch Walu
5278100	5279860	Peach for the next game.
5279860	5286260	But Miyamoto said, no, vetoed it even before seeing the design, which I can only imagine
5286260	5288820	what the design for Walu Peach would have looked like.
5288820	5294500	But Miyamoto said, I know it's going to be just like Doro and Joe, so don't bother.
5295620	5300100	Doro and Joe, and I'm probably saying there's Doro and Joe, uh, is an anime villain from
5300100	5301060	Yatterman.
5301060	5303700	Uh, and so, uh, love Yatterman.
5303700	5305060	That's a Tatanoko one.
5305060	5305300	Yeah.
5305300	5309860	So Miyamoto was like, no, not even don't even want to see it stop.
5309860	5312820	So what could have been, what could have been?
5312820	5314340	Doro and Joe looks pretty awesome.
5314340	5316340	Might be a little too spicy for Nintendo though.
5318980	5319380	All right.
5320340	5324260	Well, let's get to, if we're going to talk about classic games, I think now's a good
5324260	5326660	time to bring in our next segment.
5326660	5328100	So let's get to it.
5338820	5344340	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5344340	5346580	out a classic and tell you about it.
5346660	5349300	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5351380	5353540	And what did you pick for us tonight, Dark Sakura?
5354980	5360740	The game I am streaming on Saturday night, Star Ocean, as in the original Star Ocean.
5360740	5366100	It came out in 1996, um, on the Super Famicom.
5366100	5369620	It was developed by Tri-Ace and published by Enix.
5370180	5371300	Yes, that Enix.
5372020	5373940	It is the very first of those games.
5373940	5380820	It was released July, 1996, and was the first game developed by Tri-Ace that was, uh, mostly
5380820	5385700	made up of staff that had left Wolf Team being unhappy with the development for Tales of
5385700	5387940	Fantasia with Namco in 1995.
5388580	5394740	It uses a special compression chip to compress and store all the games data, um, because
5394740	5397620	the graphics in it really pushed the limits of the Super Famicom.
5398260	5403380	Um, the game also had voice acting for the game's intro and voice clips that played
5403380	5404980	throughout battle gameplay.
5405780	5416100	Um, and it, I, it's a really complicated story so far, but it has these three friends who
5416100	5423460	experience a new disease and they come into contact with, uh, with people from a space
5423460	5424580	faring federation.
5424580	5426020	Like it almost sounds like Star Trek.
5426020	5426520	Okay.
5426900	5433140	Um, and they find a time travel device that lets them go back in time to try to find
5433140	5434100	the cure for their planet.
5434980	5444980	Um, it, it's, it was never released like just outside, only, only in, uh, Japan because
5444980	5447860	the American branch closed shortly before the game was finished.
5448500	5454820	And then they were also doing a little bit more focusing on Nintendo 64 stuff, but the
5454820	5460980	game was actually remade by Tose for, uh, the PSP as Star Ocean First Departure.
5461940	5467700	And, uh, it was released in North America, Europe and Australia, October, 2008.
5467700	5472660	And then there's a remastered, which is Star Ocean First Departure R for the Switch and
5472660	5475700	PlayStation 4 that came out in December of 2019.
5476260	5481140	And it was the start of the entire Star Ocean series, which is six games, three spinoffs
5481140	5482660	to remake a remaster and a manga.
5483620	5491460	Um, but going back to the original Star Ocean, it is a top-down RPG.
5492180	5493700	I'm not seeing anything on the window.
5494900	5495620	Oh, there it is.
5495620	5496260	Okay.
5496260	5497620	It's a top-down RPG.
5498740	5505860	Um, and you, you walk around your party as, you know, compressed into one person, interacting
5505860	5506500	with players.
5507220	5516180	Um, and then you have, like, when you're in battle, you're, it's sort of like Secret
5516180	5521620	of Mana this way, where you do have a dedicated battle screen and you can control one character
5521620	5524660	and the other to have tactics for how they fight.
5525380	5531300	Um, and, uh, you don't really have like a world map.
5531300	5535060	You have like a mini map sort of thing, but it's still not much help.
5535780	5540100	Um, but you can recruit up to eight additional characters to go with you.
5540660	5545620	Some happen automatically, some depend on actions that you did in the past.
5546420	5551060	Um, but there are up to 10 characters that are able to be recruited, even though you
5551060	5552420	can only recruit eight.
5552980	5558020	So it does allow some replayability and it has something, you know, it does contribute
5558020	5561060	to the way the story, uh, plays out.
5561780	5569460	Um, so, uh, at any rate, um, the combat is that 3D isometric view.
5570260	5576660	Um, but like I said, you, you have battle strategies that your others use, um, you know,
5576660	5579700	that are basically AI characters, and then you have your own thing.
5580420	5585460	Um, you can get special points, uh, called SP from battle and they're used to customize
5585460	5586180	your abilities.
5586180	5592980	So for example, you could give SP to cooking and then you can make food out of just raw
5592980	5594420	material that you'll find.
5594420	5602180	Um, you can have people who can create weapons, um, upgrade items, um, and then individuals
5602180	5604900	can have, uh, up to 20 items.
5604900	5607700	There's also private actions, which I think are cool.
5607700	5614100	So like, like for example, and I'm still right at the start, but there's a part when you
5614100	5617860	first go into the past and your, your team of four is separated.
5618420	5625620	And so you have the main guy and then the Iria, who is like, uh, the second in command
5625620	5630580	on the spaceship and she's wearing very futuristic clothes that don't fit the planet.
5630580	5633060	So the main guy has to go and find clothes for her.
5633060	5638100	So they actually have one of these private actions right at the beginning where they
5638100	5644260	discuss, like, do you want to risk me going in or do you want me to just stay here?
5644820	5649780	And, you know, I said, stay here while I look around, but then, uh, his name is Radix by
5649780	5651140	the way, R-A-T-I-X.
5651140	5655940	Um, and then there's other things that you can go on with.
5655940	5659460	Like, for example, when you're looking for the clothes, you can choose to steal them
5659460	5666260	off of a clothesline, or you can go into the house and ask a lady if she has extra clothes
5666260	5672100	for a woman, you know, and even then it's like, make up a story, tell the truth, or,
5672100	5675620	you know, you've got all these different, like, yes, no actions.
5676260	5683860	Um, and then, you know, you build up affinity with the other, uh, party members.
5684580	5691700	Um, so that, you know, for example, how well you treat them determines how close you are
5691700	5693940	with them and it affects the game.
5693940	5701300	I mean, we're talking like BioWare levels of, of character interaction in an SNE, in
5701300	5702420	a Super Famicom game.
5704660	5706740	So this game was really ahead of its time.
5707460	5708980	It really, really was.
5708980	5715540	Um, and I don't know why it took me so long to finally play it, but I'm, I'm absolutely
5715540	5716900	adoring this game.
5716900	5719300	It is in the music is so good.
5719300	5720020	It's so good.
5720660	5721540	And it's so pretty.
5721540	5722740	Look how pretty this game is.
5724020	5729620	Well, the podcast listeners can't see it, but you can always look it up or check out
5729620	5730820	one of Dark Sakura's streams.
5732100	5738180	Well, and the, the, uh, music for Star Ocean and then the first Departure, uh, remake were
5738180	5740420	done by, um, Sakuraba Motoye.
5741060	5747620	Um, the music is on an album that was released, uh, November 1st, 1996 by Sony Records called
5747620	5749380	Star Ocean Perfect Sound Collection.
5750180	5757700	Um, and even some of the, the music that was released with it is sort of like a prog rock
5757700	5758100	style.
5758100	5762580	So I'm kind of down for it and I absolutely want to, um, get it.
5762580	5767220	In fact, the first Departure remake had a song called Heart that was performed by a music
5767220	5768980	group called, um, Asunaro.
5769700	5773620	And, uh, it played with the opening credits on, on that version.
5774260	5780820	Um, and then there was, uh, a different song on first Departure are called, um, uh, Atarashi
5780820	5789780	Ippo, which means the first step by, um, Yaichi Keiko, um, of, uh, Shadow of Lathandor.
5790660	5799540	Um, at any rate, the game sold, uh, approximately 235,000 copies in Japan, um, which is just
5799540	5804980	over, uh, the 175,000 copies that were just sold in 1996.
5805780	5812660	Um, it was considered one of the best looking Super Nintendo games ever made in that it,
5812660	5815380	it still holds up today, which I agree it does hold up.
5816020	5820100	Um, Famitsu gave the game a 31 out of 40.
5820100	5828260	Um, uh, for game rankings, it, uh, on the SNES one had, uh, a 93% PSP at 77%.
5828260	5836020	Um, yeah, the English version really just got kind of good, but not great reviews.
5836740	5843140	Um, but it was considered one of the best remakes of a Squenix game ever.
5843140	5845460	Of course, it was released under Squenix at that time.
5846180	5854980	Um, but it's, the game itself is so solid and it's, I, I've had so much fun with it
5854980	5857780	just in the three hours that I've played it, that I,
5857780	5860900	I'm looking forward to playing it every, every week for you guys.
5861540	5863460	So that, that's it.
5863460	5867460	It's, it's Star Ocean published by Enix, created by Tri-Ace.
5868740	5869700	All right.
5869700	5870500	Great pick.
5870500	5873940	Uh, one that I need to, I, I think I've barely touched this game.
5873940	5876900	So this is one I feel like I need to revisit too, but that's it.
5876900	5879780	Star Ocean, the classic game of the week.
5880420	5880900	Great pick.
5881860	5882580	All right.
5882580	5884340	And like I said, super fun.
5884340	5884740	Yeah.
5884740	5888180	And a very long game too, if this let's play is any indication.
5888180	5889540	It's like 24 parts.
5889540	5892180	So yeah, it's going to put some hours into that.
5893140	5897220	It's, it's a lot more dynamic and complex than I thought it was going in.
5897220	5897720	Yeah.
5898180	5899940	So I'm already engaged with it.
5899940	5900440	Nice.
5900980	5905140	Some comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
5905140	5908420	Uh, Mishkin says, I still need to get Star Ocean R.
5909300	5912980	Mike Deff says, I still remember the twist in SO3 with the eyes emoji.
5912980	5914660	Not going to say what it is right now.
5914660	5918900	Uh, Questbuster says, one of the things I appreciated about Tri-Ace was how fun their
5918900	5922820	combat systems were in their games, like their Star Ocean games to Valkyrie profile.
5924260	5925060	All right.
5925060	5930580	Let's, uh, cover some other headlines, uh, rapidly and some rapid fire news.
5930580	5931080	Loki.
5932020	5932340	Yeah.
5932340	5938580	So apparently, uh, Bruce Stanley, uh, former Naughty Dog employee is unhappy that he is
5938580	5943300	not credited in the new HBO show for the last of us.
5943300	5948340	Since he was the game director behind the game on PlayStation three.
5948900	5950740	Um, he was also credited though.
5950740	5956660	Like they had a whole special, um, thanks for him in the last of us part one remake.
5956660	5959140	Um, but no mention of him on the show.
5959140	5962660	He did leave Naughty Dog in 2017 though.
5962660	5966100	Um, but it feels, you know, he should have been credited.
5966100	5967540	Probably should have been credited.
5967540	5969060	I heard the show is really good though.
5969060	5973460	I mean, I guess I shouldn't remind people it's on Sunday nights or whatever.
5973460	5974260	It's all on demand.
5974260	5974420	Now.
5974420	5976740	Most people are watching on demand whenever you want.
5976740	5977060	Yeah.
5977060	5979620	Um, but I mean, I've heard it's really good.
5979620	5980980	So yeah.
5980980	5981480	Yeah.
5981940	5985220	Uh, more game announcements for PlayStation VR two.
5985220	5990340	Um, these are going to be some updates for already existing games, including rez.
5990340	5996100	Infinite is going to be coming, um, on February 22nd.
5996100	5997140	That's pretty awesome.
5997780	6005380	Um, and then I saw something about, um, now I don't know, like, if it's necessarily like
6005380	6009060	going to be a really cool feature or not because they have all the eye tracking stuff, but
6009060	6014020	for Tetris effect though, I saw that you can actually use your eyes to control when you
6014020	6017860	go into that focus mode or whatever, which I thought was kind of interesting.
6017860	6021860	Like if you blink for like two seconds or something like that, it's supposed to like
6022980	6025380	trigger it or something neat.
6026100	6028260	Sounds gimmicky to me, but cool.
6028260	6028760	Yeah.
6029140	6029640	Yeah.
6029640	6033060	Um, so yeah, that's going to be, uh, ported over.
6033060	6038180	And I think if you had the original that, yeah, players who own the original PlayStation
6038180	6040500	four additional be able to upgrade it for, uh, $10.
6042500	6044180	Oh, they're not even giving it to you.
6045060	6047140	No, Sony got to have that money.
6047140	6052420	Money on, uh, uh, this is, this is, this is why I said what I said a couple of weeks ago.
6052420	6057060	I don't think the VR two is set up for success, but you know, and I look, I love rez.
6057060	6058100	I love Tetris effect.
6058100	6059060	They're great games.
6059620	6060820	We already played them.
6060820	6064580	Like these are not, these are not tent pole titles that are going to move hundreds of
6064580	6066180	thousands of VR twos.
6066180	6069380	Well, this is in 4k now at 60 FPS.
6069380	6071060	I don't remember what the last one was in.
6071060	6076580	If that was also 4k at 60 FPS, but, uh, this one's going to be in 4k at 60 FPS.
6076580	6081300	And, um, they have both five, one and seven, one surround sound audio options.
6081300	6083540	Pretty sure that was in the last one though.
6083540	6089380	Um, yeah, I mean, I don't like to see that, but.
6091140	6092500	Uh, we'll, we'll see how it goes.
6092500	6093940	Um, some comments from chat.
6093940	6097860	Bobby Black Wolf says these are the indie devs that are having you pay for the upgrade.
6097860	6100580	GT seven is a free upgrade to PSVR too.
6100580	6102580	I wouldn't necessarily blame Sony for it.
6103860	6107460	I just, you know, again, I'm not exactly in a rush to get a VR too.
6107460	6110580	And again, I love those games, but I can play them on hardware.
6110580	6111060	I already have.
6111700	6117300	And honestly, neither one of those games are that I get the Tetris effect is great in VR,
6117300	6123220	but it's not, it's not such a colossal step down to play on a, a, a regular traditional
6123220	6124340	screen either for me.
6124340	6125940	Like it's pretty fun though.
6125940	6126980	I do like rez.
6126980	6127220	It is.
6127220	6130740	But again, I think, and also I'm like, okay, look, I love rez.
6130740	6133620	I look, I am a huge music, Gucci stand.
6133620	6135060	I love everything that guy's made.
6135060	6136340	I even love 99 night.
6136340	6137540	Well, I liked it a lot.
6137540	6138660	99 nights.
6138660	6139140	Okay.
6139140	6143620	Like, but I'm just like, rez has been released.
6143620	6149780	How many times why was rez area X not its own game.
6150420	6157860	And considering that the, the, the graphics in rez, like considering what the style of
6157860	6162740	the graphics in rez are, is really, they're going to be a difference between 10 80 and
6162740	6163620	4k.
6163620	6166580	Like, is it really make that much of a difference?
6166580	6170820	Area X might, but it's not, yeah, it's not going to be the end all be all.
6170820	6170980	No.
6172580	6176340	So, uh, and then, uh, you know, I'm just like, what, what could we get some love for child
6176340	6180020	of Eden, which, you know, has kind of been overlooked over the years, uh, you know, which
6180020	6184420	was the connect game on three 60, but has never really seen a revival like rez has,
6184420	6190180	or just, I just, I don't understand rez area X was very, very clearly the prototype for
6190180	6192900	a rez part two or some type of SQL to rez.
6192900	6193380	Where's that?
6193380	6194900	That's what they should have released.
6194900	6199700	That's you want to get my fucking attention, release that for the VR too.
6199700	6200980	But I, you know, I understand.
6200980	6204980	I see the comments in chat rez isn't necessarily exclusive to PlayStation either.
6204980	6209940	But if Sony would be willing to toss them a little money to make it exclusive or at
6209940	6212100	least give it that release window or whatever you want to call it.
6212100	6213860	I mean, they're looking to purchase companies.
6213860	6215940	Why can't they throw a little money for an exclusive deal?
6215940	6217940	I mean, they are already doing it with Spiderman and stuff.
6217940	6222980	I mean, so I'm gonna, well, Spiderman is also somewhat in-house with Sony, but that's
6222980	6225700	another, that's the licensing thing.
6225700	6226260	All right.
6226260	6226500	All right.
6226500	6227780	Let's get to dark soccer story.
6230660	6237700	So Deadpool himself has come forward saying that there's going to be Deadpool in Marvel's
6237700	6242820	midnight sons and I can't get over this adorable witch hat that he's wearing.
6244740	6247060	It just says, stay tuned for more details.
6248020	6252580	We might have more, I think that that's awesome, but I'm absolutely zero
6252580	6255860	surprised that Deadpool is joining the roster.
6255860	6256360	Yeah.
6257060	6257620	That'd be fun.
6258340	6259860	I just got Wolverine though.
6259860	6262660	Well, not yet, but we ran into him.
6262660	6263160	Yeah.
6264660	6265160	All right.
6265700	6269940	Before I get to my story, let me get to another comment from chat over twitch.tv slash vog
6269940	6270340	network.
6270340	6273220	Mike Def says, you know what Mizuguchi game needs to come back?
6274100	6275220	And that is Meteos.
6276100	6279780	Granted that was with Sakurai, but still I loved Meteos.
6279780	6280820	I'm going to be honest though.
6280820	6283460	Meteos had an Xbox 360 arcade release.
6284020	6286900	It doesn't work quite as well on controller.
6286900	6290820	Like it's, it's doable, but there's something about the touch screen and I'm not, I'm not
6290820	6293300	sure they could do Meteos on a system besides the DS.
6293300	6297300	I mean, I know the switch has a touch screen, so maybe that they could do something where
6297300	6299300	you could play with controller or on the touch screen.
6299300	6305060	But I, I feel like, I don't know if Meteos fits into any current system, I guess maybe
6305060	6305560	the switch.
6306260	6308500	Honestly, I try a mobile version.
6308820	6310020	I wouldn't be opposed to it.
6310020	6311540	I think it's a game that could work very well.
6311540	6312580	But yeah, I loved Meteos.
6312580	6313700	That game was so cool.
6314340	6315380	So we'll see.
6316420	6316740	Dr.
6316740	6319140	Cia says, wasn't that the one that had the E3 demo?
6319140	6319700	Yes, it was.
6319700	6320580	You could like download.
6320580	6325140	I remember downloading the demo from the wifi station and like keeping it on the DS for
6325140	6328340	like two weeks until it accidentally ran out of battery or something like that.
6328340	6328980	It was pretty rad.
6329540	6330040	Yeah.
6330740	6331300	All right.
6331300	6331780	Let's see.
6331780	6332900	I have a quick story too.
6332900	6335940	And that has to do with, uh, Quirtle.
6336740	6339780	Jason was referring to this a little bit in the intro tonight, but you know, there's all
6339780	6342020	these Wordle clones, right?
6342020	6345140	So some of them have you do multiple words at once.
6345140	6348900	I guess I think Jason name checked one that was like 32 words at once.
6348900	6352580	Quirtle, I think was one of the first of these because it was four words at once.
6353540	6358420	Well, as we know, Wordle ended up getting acquired by the New York Times sometime ago.
6358420	6362980	Quirtle has now found a new owner and it's not the New York Times.
6362980	6364340	It's Merriam Webster.
6364980	6365620	Yeah.
6365620	6367220	Like the dictionary.
6367220	6373940	So if you actually go to Quirtle.com, which is Q U O R D L E.com, it actually goes to
6373940	6375220	a, it's a redirect.
6375220	6379380	Basically redirects you to Merriam Webster.com slash games slash Quirtle.
6379380	6381140	So kind of interesting, huh?
6382100	6385620	So, uh, the creator Freddie Meyer sent in a message on the games help tab.
6385620	6388660	I'm delighted to announce that Quirtle was acquired by Merriam Webster.
6388660	6390740	I can't think of a better home for this game.
6390740	6392500	Lots of new features and fun to come.
6392500	6393780	So stay tuned.
6394340	6396020	So interesting.
6396020	6400180	Nine guesses or fewer to find out four five letter words at once.
6400180	6403300	It's like playing Wordle, uh, four times all at once.
6403300	6405300	But it's, I like the multi-word ones.
6405300	6406420	It's kind of fun.
6406420	6412500	So, uh, Bobby Blackwell says I play Setacortle, uh, which is 16 words at once and 21 tries.
6412500	6414100	That that's the most I've done.
6414100	6415620	The most words I've done was in that one.
6416660	6421540	Uh, Digirama S, uh, referring to last story says, what's the other puzzle game that came
6421540	6422980	out for PSP?
6422980	6427140	I think it was also by Q entertainment, every extend extra.
6427140	6429220	And then there was the Xbox 360 title.
6429220	6431380	Every step extend extra extreme.
6432180	6434580	Uh, and those, those games were a lot of fun as well.
6434580	6435080	Yeah.
6435460	6440500	I like, uh, God, I had one game of every extend extra extreme going for like over an hour
6440500	6440740	once.
6440740	6442900	I mean, it's not a particularly difficult game, but yeah.
6444740	6450100	SS2100 Matt on the Wordle topic says thoughts on the game show Lingo with RuPaul.
6450820	6451540	Haven't seen it.
6451540	6452260	I didn't realize it.
6452260	6454260	I knew it was coming, but did it debut yet?
6454260	6455540	I didn't know it debuted yet.
6457060	6457380	Yes.
6457380	6463300	Lingo is a reboot, but I will say, um, uh, RuPaul is a huge step up from the former host
6463300	6465300	on the game show network, which was Chuck Woolery.
6466020	6468260	Uh, and then, um, I'm not sure.
6468260	6471140	I think the original version goes all the way back to maybe the seventies.
6471140	6475460	I don't remember who hosted the original original ego, but, um, game show network had a revival
6475460	6476900	in the, um, nineties.
6476900	6477140	Okay.
6477140	6478100	It's on Paramount plus.
6478900	6479940	Makes sense.
6479940	6480580	I'm curious.
6480580	6481380	I'll check it out.
6481860	6487140	Um, I, I like seeing RuPaul do things that are not just drag race.
6487140	6491940	So, um, I think a game show host is a great place for RuPaul to be.
6491940	6493380	So, uh, I'll check it out.
6493380	6493620	Yeah.
6494340	6494900	All right.
6494900	6498580	Let's talk about some things you can check out a little sooner as we travel around the
6498580	6499940	world and check out some release dates.
6499940	6501140	How about in the U S Loki?
6501860	6506580	Oh, this week we have four spoken on PC and PlayStation five.
6507380	6512900	Um, hyper dimension, Neptunia sister versus sisters are sisters versus sisters.
6512900	6520020	That's on PC PlayStation four and PlayStation five, uh, risen on Nintendo switch PlayStation
6520020	6521940	four and Xbox one.
6522660	6532260	Disgaea seven on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five pizza tower on PC
6533140	6540420	story of seasons, a wonderful life on Nintendo switch, summertime rendering another horizon
6540420	6542740	on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.
6543620	6548820	Uh, we've got wonder boy anniversary collection on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation
6548820	6557620	five Alice escaped on PC and Nintendo switch a tone heart of the elder tree on PC, Nintendo
6557940	6564740	switch and PlayStation four and the remake of dead space on PC PlayStation five and Xbox
6564740	6565220	series.
6565860	6566340	That's it.
6566900	6567220	All right.
6567860	6570660	Traveling to Japan, a lot of us similar stuff as well.
6570660	6574580	I'm sure Disgaea seven on the switch is going to be a very big release this week.
6574580	6577060	Uh, it sounds like around the world cause we're getting it in the U S too, but it's
6577060	6578900	also on Japan this week on the switch.
6578900	6583780	Also summertime rendering another horizon out in Japan this week on the switch story
6583780	6585460	of seasons, a wonderful life.
6585540	6587540	I didn't chronicle rising.
6587540	6589940	Please note that is not the full I had in Chronicles game.
6589940	6594100	This is another one of those like prequel games or whatever the, the games that lead
6594100	6595300	up to I had in Chronicles.
6595940	6598180	I'm not sure what type of game this is.
6598180	6599780	I was trying to guess from the screenshots.
6599780	6603540	If it's like an RPG as well, if it's more like action oriented, it looks like it might
6603540	6605860	be a little more action, uh, in this.
6605860	6607780	So that is out in Japan this week.
6607780	6610100	Is this the one we are actually, did we already have this here?
6610100	6611060	I think we did.
6611060	6612740	Was this out on Xbox here?
6613540	6616180	Now someone in shadow, I eat in Chronicle rising.
6618100	6618740	I don't know.
6618740	6619620	Thank you.
6619620	6622580	Rama says it's a 2d side scroller action RPG.
6622580	6623540	It's on game pass.
6623540	6623700	Okay.
6623700	6624100	Thank you.
6624100	6625780	So it's out on the switch in Japan.
6625780	6628660	So it just, sometimes things are a little delayed while they get localized.
6628660	6628900	All right.
6628900	6629860	So it's not a different one.
6629860	6631860	It's the same one we already had here a few months ago.
6631860	6632360	Got it.
6633380	6638180	Summertime rendering another horizon also out of the switch Haru kiss in a regular and
6638180	6643380	limited edition and Dora think the thrilling brain adventures of Nobita.
6643380	6643780	That's right.
6643780	6645060	That is also out this week.
6645060	6646100	And that is a Dora mon.
6646100	6647700	That is a, another Dora mon game.
6647700	6651860	I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like a education game cause it's called think, um,
6653060	6655780	maybe, but it looks cute, especially if you like Dora mom.
6655780	6657940	Uh, let's look at the PlayStation five real quick.
6657940	6662340	A lot of the same stuff such as Disgaea seven summertime rendering another horizon.
6662340	6664260	I eat in Chronicle rising store.
6664260	6664820	I'm sorry.
6664820	6665860	I'm looking at the wrong list.
6666420	6667220	How did that happen?
6668020	6668980	Let's try that again.
6669700	6675540	Uh, in Japan, we do have I eat in Chronicle rising, uh, and go simulator three Disgaea
6675540	6678020	seven is out on the PlayStation five this week.
6678020	6683300	Uh, the Witcher three wild hunt, the multi-language, uh, souped up edition that is out as well.
6683860	6690180	And for spoken on the 24th, a little bit early, but I'm sure that is because that looks like
6690180	6693140	that's going to be a worldwide release, uh, this week.
6693140	6694740	This is a pretty big week for games.
6695540	6696420	What's Europe look like?
6696420	6696980	Dark soccer.
6700980	6702580	Like my unmute button.
6702580	6707220	Um, not, not, not really super huge.
6707220	6714740	Um, what we have is on the 24th, we have four spoken for PlayStation risen for PlayStation
6714740	6719380	and switch PlayStation has world war Z aftermath.
6719780	6721860	26,000 odd ballers on switch.
6722500	6727780	Also the Witcher three wild hunt for PlayStation and X-Box dead space in the 27th.
6728580	6730820	And that's what came up.
6732340	6733300	All right.
6733300	6734900	Pretty, pretty big week for games.
6734900	6737780	Good way to, um, you know, kick off the year since we're still in January.
6737780	6739220	I can still say we're kicking off the year.
6739860	6744660	Uh, let's do a few more stories and then we'll get to your comments and calls and all that
6744660	6746820	good stuff in our listener round table.
6746820	6748180	But first Loki.
6749220	6749540	Yeah.
6749540	6755300	So the question is what happens to all of those stadia exclusive games that were out
6755300	6755540	there?
6756100	6758660	Well, we have an answer at least for one of those.
6758660	6764420	So there's a game called gun sport, which was, I guess, a 2d, uh, volleyball type game
6764420	6765300	that was a stadium.
6765300	6767140	So when I think of volleyball, I think of guns.
6768260	6769940	Well, it's the sci-fi volleyball game.
6769940	6776740	So, uh, by Necrosoft and they then later on ended up releasing at least last year, a
6776900	6781860	sequel, which is hyper gun sport, and that's been available on multiple platforms, but
6781860	6783220	one of those being steam.
6783940	6791140	So what they've decided to do since a CD is shutting down, they made their, um, exclusive
6791140	6792340	game gun sport.
6792900	6797220	They allowed you to actually be able to play it through hyper gun sports.
6797220	6803220	So if you access the beta channel through hyper gun sport, you will have a, you'll be
6803220	6809300	able to access a version of gun sport, um, an offline version that is being made available
6809300	6810180	through that.
6810180	6811780	So that's cool that you'll be able to do that.
6811780	6816020	And they said it's because of, um, they care about game preservation.
6816020	6818660	So they went ahead and made a version of that available.
6820340	6820980	Pretty cool.
6820980	6821480	Nice.
6822580	6827140	Actually, that does remind me to ask our resident, um, stadia power user, uh, dark
6827140	6832020	Sakura, how, who just made the biggest wamp face.
6832740	6835140	How was the final day of stadia?
6835140	6836180	How was the final day?
6836740	6837780	I decided not to play.
6838820	6839320	Really?
6840020	6841220	I made my break already.
6841860	6843860	I wasn't going to watch the ship sink.
6843860	6845300	That was the night I was playing with you.
6845300	6845700	Wasn't it?
6845700	6847380	Was the last, uh, yeah.
6847380	6852580	Cause I, I said something like, it was, that was the day before the last, but at the same
6852580	6856740	time, I was just like, you know, I, I can't, I don't.
6856980	6858740	I, I made my break.
6859620	6863860	And on top of that, I didn't want to play any dead by daylight and get like something
6863860	6866340	that would have been an achievement just to have to do it again.
6866340	6867460	That would have been a little salt.
6867460	6867960	Yeah.
6868660	6872900	So I was just like, you know, I, I made my break.
6872900	6873620	I'm done.
6873620	6874180	I'm good.
6874180	6874500	Okay.
6874500	6874900	Fair.
6874900	6875620	Fair.
6875620	6880660	You know, I saw, but my stream title was RIP stadia.
6880660	6881160	Okay.
6881480	6881980	Yeah.
6882360	6887800	Um, I do, since I know you're on G force now, now, cause I know you tried, what was it?
6887800	6889000	Bloober or whatever.
6889000	6889500	Boostroid.
6890440	6893480	Bloober is a team that makes video games like silent hill 2 remakes.
6893480	6896280	Um, boostroid over, uh, was overseas.
6896280	6898440	So I know you were having some lag trouble with that.
6898440	6900200	So you, you kind of are on G force.
6900200	6903080	Now I saw an interesting headline about that though.
6903080	6908280	That, um, I don't know if it was bungee or somebody was helping out destiny two players
6908280	6915560	on stadia with like a free month of G force to try to transition them over to that platform.
6915560	6917880	So this could be Google's loss.
6917880	6919720	Could be Nvidia's gain at the end of the day.
6919720	6921000	It seems like it could be interesting.
6921720	6926280	Especially if, you know, if this droid has, you know, doesn't up their game and get ready
6926280	6932920	for, you know, an overseas, uh, group, then they're going to be SOL.
6932920	6933420	Yeah.
6933980	6939100	I'm kind of surprised that, that bungee didn't go to Microsoft with this.
6939100	6942140	Cause we know Xbox has a cloud and they can play destiny too.
6942140	6946460	So it was just, I was a little surprised that they didn't go there, but maybe Nvidia was
6946460	6951420	really eager to cut the deal because I'm sure when Nvidia saw that stadia was going to help
6951420	6954860	held, there's probably a lot of people like you, Jamie, that are now checking out Nvidia.
6954860	6962300	So Nvidia seeing dollar signs where, uh, stadia, you know, has, has left our world.
6962300	6963500	So interesting.
6966860	6967500	All right.
6968140	6971500	Zen monkey 11 and chat says offline version I'm sold.
6971500	6971740	Yeah.
6971740	6976380	That is nice for the, um, you know, exclusive games to get, you know, I'm, I imagine those
6976380	6979820	exclusive agreements are now Nolan void with the sunsetting of stadia.
6979820	6983740	So I'm kind of glad that they, uh, well, maybe they're not, maybe that's why they had to
6983740	6986940	kind of do this a tricky way and embed it within an existing game.
6986940	6992060	Maybe they wanted to steer clear of any potential, uh, legal issues there.
6992380	6993180	Hmm.
6993180	6993580	Anyway.
6994220	6994540	All right.
6994540	6996300	Uh, moving on dark Sakura.
6998940	7001180	Me whale.
7001180	7012700	Um, there is, uh, some, uh, information about, uh, suicide squad game, uh, coming out where
7012700	7022700	they're saying that there is going to be, um, some, uh, a battle pass to, for cosmetics
7022700	7023260	and whatnot.
7023900	7028620	Um, not a lot of information about it, but the currencies that were shown in the leaked
7028620	7034380	image are experience that's used to power up and customize your skill trees.
7034940	7037100	So they're all unique for each player.
7037180	7044940	Um, VGC was told that you start off really good and can get ridiculous.
7045580	7049660	So it's, uh, it's open world.
7049660	7052460	It's just, the game is suicide squad, kill the justice league, by the way.
7053020	7057340	Um, and it's from the people that did the Arkham asylum series.
7057340	7059180	So I don't know.
7059180	7059740	It looks fun.
7063260	7066220	I don't, I mean, I guess battle pass stuff is okay.
7066220	7070620	I'm kind of already doing it, uh, fifth dream and chat with an ominous prediction though,
7070620	7073420	saying, Oh, Avengers again, we saw where that went.
7074140	7078620	So, Hmm, hopefully they play this a little smarter.
7080060	7081900	Second player games don't need a battle pass.
7083900	7086300	Saying, all right.
7087020	7088380	I'm moving on Loki.
7089500	7091100	How about another game with a battle pass?
7093020	7093980	At least this is an online game.
7093980	7095100	At least it's free to play now.
7095100	7095820	It's free to play now.
7096140	7097100	It's free to play.
7097100	7097820	So yes.
7097820	7107900	Um, some of the pro overwatch teams are apparently look seeking legal, um, help to sue, um,
7107900	7113180	Activision blizzard over the losses that they're making from, um, you know, not being able
7113180	7115180	to participate in these overwatch leagues.
7115180	7121580	So, uh, apparently there's a majority of the Overwatch league, uh, league teams are working
7121580	7126620	with a British law firm for a collective bargaining process against the event organizers
7126620	7132860	after years of high operating costs and continually missing promises on a rep of news.
7132860	7142140	So, um, they're saying that they're seeking, uh, somewhere between 7.5 and 10 million in
7142140	7143500	franchise payouts.
7145500	7148380	So that's a lot of money.
7149020	7153260	I guess we'll have to wait and see if they actually, um, end up suing or not.
7153260	7155420	I'm sure there'll be big news if they end up doing that.
7155420	7156380	Yeah, that would be huge.
7156380	7160220	But I just over Overwatch league, like doesn't have a broadcast partner right now.
7161340	7165180	And you know, this is the time when like this, the fire is supposed to be hot with overwatch
7165180	7166460	with overwatch two and everything.
7166460	7172380	It's just like, this is, you know, a lot of people really invested a lot to make overwatch
7172380	7173100	league happen.
7173100	7177740	So it's, um, this is, this could, I don't know, this doesn't bode well.
7177740	7180380	I hope, uh, I hope Activision is able to figure this out.
7181900	7182300	Yeah.
7182300	7182540	Yeah.
7183260	7184140	It's not bode well.
7185100	7188220	Phil of nine and chat says, overwatch might just be over.
7188220	7193260	Well, I mean, the overwatch league, uh, which would be hugely detrimental to the industry.
7193260	7197500	There's a lot of people involved in the overwatch league, a lot, you know, it's like a sports
7197500	7197660	league.
7197660	7201660	It's an entire sports league going under if that I'm not, you know, maybe I'm, I don't
7201660	7204460	mean to be too, uh, you know, I don't know.
7204460	7207580	I mean, I don't mean to blow up the issue too much, but it's, it is an issue.
7207980	7211580	You know, to, to the longevity of the, the, the league.
7212140	7214700	I think the game itself is fine.
7214700	7218540	I think enough people are playing it, but you know, I'm also not Activision Blizzard.
7218540	7224060	So anyway, last story for tonight.
7224060	7229420	This one is, uh, interesting, but it's, uh, talks about a little bit of a Popeye crossover
7229420	7230380	in donkey Kong.
7230380	7236460	It's not quite what you think, but it's a little piece of Nintendo history because apparently
7236460	7241180	in the original design documents for the donkey Kong game, when we can actually see
7241180	7246860	what some of those look like this week, we actually see Popeye in some of the design
7246860	7248220	documents for this.
7248220	7253980	So, um, uh, Nintendo was going to use the Popeye license for basically what ended up
7253980	7259900	being donkey Kong because donkey Kong would have been a Bluto, uh, jump man or Mario would
7259900	7262300	have been Popeye, you know, and so forth.
7262380	7267260	Uh, and olive oil instead of Pauline, you know where I'm going with this, but then obviously
7267260	7268940	it all became donkey Kong.
7268940	7273580	So even though, you know, uh, they didn't get to use Popeye for this.
7273580	7277820	This is weird though, because Nintendo did end up making a Popeye game, but I think they
7277820	7283260	were, maybe they got the license later or something, or maybe because of the success
7283260	7287420	of donkey Congress, I distinctly remember there being a Nintendo, at least in the arcades
7287420	7292700	anyway, published game that I think then trickled down to all the home systems.
7292700	7295900	Cause I know I had it on Commodore 64 and it was on Atari version.
7295900	7297820	It was an early Nintendo release too.
7297820	7302220	So it might've been the success of donkey Kong that led to this, but yeah, originally,
7302220	7306860	if you didn't know donkey Kong was designed with Popeye in mind and these design documents
7306860	7307360	prove it.
7307980	7313340	So that's all just a cute little, isn't that interesting sort of thing and piece of gaming
7313340	7314780	history in that.
7314780	7316700	So there you go.
7318140	7318540	All right.
7319820	7324940	DJ Rama S says the Popeye game was a port that they published, but they did the arcade
7324940	7325900	version, didn't they?
7327100	7333100	I thought that was now I have to look it up because this is going to bother me if I don't.
7333100	7333820	Yeah.
7333820	7337580	Popeye was 1982 platform game developed and released by Nintendo.
7338460	7343580	And then the game was licensed by Atari for the UK and Ireland and Nintendo ported it
7343580	7347420	to the Famicom while Parker brothers did all the others and Parker brothers was huge
7347420	7350860	in video games and importing everything back in the day.
7350860	7354060	So yeah, that was an, it was by Nintendo R and D one.
7354060	7358220	So Miyamoto actually was part of the design for this.
7358220	7363660	The Popeye characters were originally slated for donkey Kong, but Nintendo was unable to
7363660	7365020	license the characters at the time.
7365020	7367340	So basically it was no, you're fine, Rama.
7367340	7370220	I'm glad we're doing a research and getting this all together.
7370220	7374460	So I guess you could say because of the success of donkey Kong, or maybe just a timing thing,
7374460	7378140	they were able to get Popeye and do a different game with that, which was fine.
7378140	7380380	I thought the Popeye game was fine for its day.
7380940	7382540	You know, the different types of levels.
7382540	7388700	They're actually, there's a, there's a lot of interesting parallels to donkey Kong actually
7389660	7391260	in the early Popeye games.
7391260	7393420	So pretty neat.
7394140	7394540	All right.
7395100	7396780	Let's go to the list around table.
7396780	7401420	We invite your feedback every week on the show via our mailbag, uh, through discord.
7401420	7405820	If you want to join our green room over at, uh, vog network.com slash discord.
7405820	7409340	And of course our chat room, if you have any random questions you'd like to ask us in chat,
7409340	7413180	cause we haven't had enough tangents tonight, twitch.tv slash vog network.
7413180	7416620	I don't think I saw emails, but let me check with dark Sakura.
7416620	7417580	I didn't think so.
7417580	7421340	If you want to change this very disturbing trend, I don't think we've had an email in
7421340	7422140	like six weeks.
7422700	7423820	We'll just blame the holidays.
7423900	7428860	Participate at orange launch radio.com is the place to send an email if you would like.
7429580	7434460	So, uh, while I wait and see if anybody in chat wants to ask a question or join us on
7434460	7437500	discord, let me hop over to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
7438060	7439900	Well, there is something I wanted to talk about.
7439900	7445980	It is a brand new DLC coming out for, um, power wash simulator.
7445980	7452780	So on the 31st of this month, they're going to have a crossover with tomb Raider and you'll,
7452780	7455900	you'll be able to wash the lowercroft mansion.
7456620	7457820	It's gonna be huge.
7457820	7458780	Oh God.
7458780	7460300	That's, that's pretty awesome though.
7460300	7461020	I like that.
7461020	7461520	Yeah.
7462380	7467500	I did play a little power wash simulator this week actually, because, uh, I, I played the
7467500	7471260	one on steam and now I'm playing the Xbox one to get achievements.
7472140	7473820	And plus it's kind of like starting over too.
7473820	7477340	Cause like now the official releases out and everything, you know, when I was playing it
7477340	7481580	before it was still in beta, but power wash is still a very fun, just chill.
7482940	7486460	I'm just going to wash these rocks type of game.
7487500	7488000	Yep.
7489500	7492220	Finara in chat says, will someone play power wash with me?
7492780	7494700	It sounds like I need to do a stream.
7494700	7495340	Is it cross?
7495340	7497260	I imagine Finara has it on stream.
7497260	7498060	Is it cross platform?
7498060	7498460	It is.
7498460	7499180	It is cross.
7499180	7501340	You can do a cross platform mode.
7501340	7505340	Um, and then you can also do like, uh, multiplayer.
7505340	7509660	I think if you do like campaign, it's only two player co-op, but outside of that, you
7509660	7510380	can do more than that.
7510380	7511420	I think that's maybe eight.
7511980	7514780	Maybe we need to do a VOG power washing night.
7518220	7519020	Maybe times.
7519020	7519580	That'd be fun.
7520780	7525180	Um, Bobby Blackwell says AGDQ did a six player stream.
7525180	7530460	I didn't realize it went up to, I thought they did a, um, they did one with, uh, they
7530460	7532860	did all the vehicles in the game.
7532860	7535020	So that was pretty neat.
7536220	7536720	Nice.
7539260	7540060	All right.
7540140	7541260	Anything else to share here?
7541260	7542140	Last minute stories.
7543420	7545260	Oh, it's all I had.
7545260	7545760	That's it.
7546380	7547260	All right.
7547260	7550780	Well, I think we believe it or not have come to the end of the show.
7551420	7553500	So thank you so much for your participation.
7553500	7554860	I, it was a little, it's weird.
7554860	7559180	We're in a, I mean, it's a big release week for games, but, um, you know, not a huge,
7559180	7560220	huge story week.
7560220	7562860	I think we still have a little ways to go before we start really getting the stories
7562860	7563660	rolling in.
7563660	7567900	I think a lot of the early parts of this year are probably going to be a ramp up to a lot
7567900	7569180	of big releases this summer.
7569180	7573900	It's going to be a very interesting summer and a very interesting E3.
7573900	7580300	I mean, but I realize E3 is back this year, supposedly, but that whole, you know, summertime
7580300	7581180	is gonna be very interesting.
7581180	7582700	It's gonna be very interesting year this year.
7582700	7583980	I'm excited to see what comes of it.
7584620	7585340	All right.
7585340	7587660	Well, um, that brings us towards the end of another show.
7587660	7590700	I want to thank everybody for being here for another episode of orange launch radio.
7590700	7592940	Thank you as always for your participation with the show.
7592940	7597340	Thank you to the live folks, especially for your generosity tonight.
7597340	7600380	As you are listening live, I really, really appreciate all of you.
7600380	7603500	Um, I really appreciate all of you that listen on the podcast feed as well.
7603500	7605660	I know we have a lot of lurkers who've never said hi.
7606220	7610300	I'm going to say hi to you anyway, then to say thank you for being here and listening
7610300	7610860	to the show.
7610860	7613340	Please feel free to drop us an email and let us know you're out there.
7613340	7616140	Um, participate at orange on traded.com.
7616700	7621580	You can also send us a tweet if you want at OLR, although I can't really be asked to check
7621580	7625180	Twitter, but once in a while I'll be like, oh yeah, I should check the OLR Twitter literally
7625180	7625980	once every other week.
7625980	7627740	I'm like, oh, I guess I should check that.
7627740	7629820	So, uh, at some point I'll see your message.
7629820	7634380	Uh, and uh, yeah, you can also join us live on a Sunday night, all great ways, but if
7634380	7638460	you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two or seven
7638460	7638940	about the show.
7638940	7641980	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
7641980	7644540	need more voices here to put out on air.
7644540	7649820	A nice five star review wherever you found this show, like iTunes, Spotify, wherever,
7649820	7652940	uh, it all goes a very long way and we appreciate those as well.
7653580	7658220	With that all being said, I think we will get to final thoughts, dark Sakura.
7658220	7662940	I'm imagining as usual, you will go play some Debbie delight after the show.
7662940	7665500	So, um, let me get your final thought first.
7666060	7672220	I finally have gotten back to work on my merch store and I will be doing the same for, uh,
7672220	7673020	orange lounge.
7673580	7673900	Yay.
7673900	7678220	That'll be great because I'd love to get some merch back out there, uh, for fog too, but
7678220	7678460	yeah.
7678460	7679500	Or are part of that.
7679500	7681020	And you know what I mean?
7681020	7682380	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
7682380	7683660	The universe, the universe.
7684540	7688220	I'm going to be ordering a sample of some stuff once I get more stuff pulled up and
7688220	7689900	let y'all know what it's like.
7689900	7694780	But yeah, um, uh, if anyone wants to see what I've done so far, just ask me.
7695340	7695820	That was great.
7696620	7697100	All right.
7697100	7698460	Have a good stream later.
7698460	7699580	All right, Loki.
7699580	7700460	That means we go to you.
7700460	7701580	Your final thought for tonight?
7702380	7710300	Uh, I hope this week is better than the last week because work is stressful and I don't
7710300	7711180	want to do it anymore.
7711580	7712780	Oh, I'm sorry.
7712780	7713660	Hope it gets better.
7714780	7718540	It's just, you know, it's, it's, it's like what we talk about in the gaming industry.
7718540	7721420	It's leadership and bad decisions that they make.
7721980	7723100	So yeah.
7723900	7724300	Let's see.
7724940	7726460	And my final thought tonight.
7726460	7727500	I'm with Mike Deft.
7727500	7731100	We're at least getting soon to Theatrhythms release in a few weeks.
7731100	7731980	That is exciting.
7731980	7733100	That is some good news.
7733100	7734780	That's some good news to end on tonight.
7734780	7736380	So that's, that's the end.
7736380	7742060	Just in the, in general, I need to pick up some other games from my backlog and get to
7742060	7742860	it already.
7742860	7747740	But, um, isn't that always the story, how it goes, but darn that real life for continuously
7747740	7748620	getting in the way.
7748620	7752220	But I'm always glad as always, if nothing else, we set aside these times on Sunday night
7752220	7754060	to hang out and do our thing.
7754060	7758460	And, uh, as we have for years and years, and I appreciate all of you for being a part of
7758460	7761980	it, and we will see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio in seven days.
7761980	7763020	Have a good week, everybody.
