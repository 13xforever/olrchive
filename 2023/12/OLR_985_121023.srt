1
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:10,849
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end of the year bump.

2
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:13,630
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not this show's live opening guffaw, that happened already.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:21,595
[SPEAKER_00]: As the news quiets down through November, we get one last hurrah in the form of the Video Game Awards and so much of what we'll be looking forward to in 2024, and in some cases 2025.

4
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:26,838
[SPEAKER_00]: New games, old games making their return, teasers, troubles, toils, and Tom Petty?

5
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:29,620
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last hurrah of the year, but not the last episode of the year.

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you about the awards reveals of the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:37,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:49,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:49,836 --> 00:01:00,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again, episode number 985 of our show for tonight, December the 10th of 2023.

10
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:06,859
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined each and every week on this program for the last 21 plus years with my co-host.

11
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:13,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

13
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:13,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, how are you?

14
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific you can look at visuals of this show as we are doing this and Loki likes to have games that play behind him while we're live and I thought for a minute I was looking at like the last ninja and now I see elevator action with penguins this must be one of those like homebrew games that's like a hodgepodge of everything

15
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:57,778
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is talking.

16
00:01:57,778 --> 00:02:00,620
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going into my gaming week.

17
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:07,565
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first season of stuff that's available on the Playdate.

18
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:10,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

19
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:12,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like I got I got the little thing.

20
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,451
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's tiny.

21
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:23,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's like a Game Boy, but I mean, it's pretty much like a Game Boy because it doesn't have a backlight on the screen.

22
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:24,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of got one of those like

23
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,110
[SPEAKER_01]: E Ink type screens.

24
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty cool.

25
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:30,951
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a bunch of games for it.

26
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,812
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a little crank on it and stuff.

27
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:39,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of it, it comes with a season of games, which is 24 games to unlock two a week.

28
00:02:39,913 --> 00:02:41,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can go into your account and unlock them all.

29
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:48,275
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's good to just do two a week because then you get to play them and actually you know, check them all out.

30
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:49,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

31
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been pretty fun.

32
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:51,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

33
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So how long ago did you order one of those?

34
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:54,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Because weren't they back ordered for a little bit?

35
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done homebrew to it?

36
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:08,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, they have their own like shop.

37
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:13,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can sideload stuff pretty easy with it as well.

38
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:15,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to at some point put on there.

39
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:18,409
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a Game Boy emulator that someone made for it.

40
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:18,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

41
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, of course, I got to put that on there.

42
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:28,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't got a chance to sideload anything yet just because there's been a lot on the shop that looked OK.

43
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:30,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to check some of those things out.

44
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:33,515
[SPEAKER_01]: So I downloaded a few things, but it's

45
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:41,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's only got the like, you know, the old Wi-Fi, so it's not super fast when it comes to downloading stuff.

46
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:45,874
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I have to really dig through itch.io and see what else is out there.

47
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:48,397
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the stuff that's on there is also on their shop.

48
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:49,578
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you know.

49
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't imagine those games are very big.

50
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:57,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no, there's only four gigabytes of storage, non expandable.

51
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And the games themselves, like the biggest game I've downloaded so far has been like 92 megs.

52
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty small.

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all black and white.

54
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So black and white.

55
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:09,182
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.

56
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:15,205
[SPEAKER_01]: The audio is like it's not just like chip tune stuff, but you can do like MP3s and things.

57
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's not very powerful to

58
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:39,106
[SPEAKER_01]: do all that stuff and they could get pretty large so they have you know different techniques and stuff with it but it it's uh you know the the screen can refresh up to like uh 50 fps it's pretty fast like it gets pretty fancy with some of those things especially like just the interface and everything's very um cool with it too just

59
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,981
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they do everything in the games.

60
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,563
[SPEAKER_07]: So all right, I've been super curious about play data.

61
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:46,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to check it out at some point.

62
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:49,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to come borrow yours for a little bit.

63
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:51,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm curious about it.

64
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:59,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I am looking in our chat room live, there was a comment about I think Zen Monkey had said something about how long does the system last after you crank it up?

65
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:02,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And important to know that the crank is not for power.

66
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:03,980
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.

67
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

68
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It charges very fast.

69
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:19,645
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, too, like the screen always stays on because it's like one of those e-reader screens.

70
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:23,607
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as it's not updating, it doesn't use any power.

71
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,928
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just on or off.

72
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,749
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the the updating is what takes power.

73
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:35,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So unlike your typical like a phone or something like that, where it leaves the screen on all the time, they'll drain the battery.

74
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,113
[SPEAKER_01]: This does not.

75
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:40,796
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it just has like you can put a clock on it and it'll just stay like that.

76
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:45,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it just draws very little power.

77
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:55,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my kids are playing around with it yesterday, and I think even them just using it is like maybe 10% after an hour.

78
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:58,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think it's got a pretty decent battery life in it.

79
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,100
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

80
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm going to go back and check in because I think we do have them just without the VTube.

81
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:05,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

82
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:08,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't turned it back on yet.

83
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:09,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

84
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:13,559
[SPEAKER_07]: That's I thought maybe that was part of what was going on with the system.

85
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,080
[SPEAKER_07]: But hello.

86
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, there's a tech difficulty tonight.

87
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,743
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's it is for a good reason, right?

88
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:25,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you got upgrades to your computer, if I remember the text, right?

89
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I just upgraded the operating system.

90
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:27,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's

91
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,709
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still that's still an upgrade.

92
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:38,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I get excited whenever my phone gets a new updating system because the latest one brought us the the fact that the phones can mate.

93
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:48,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when I was I met somebody out at the club, and we just we touched our foot, we made our phones kiss, they went one and then they share the contact data.

94
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's like the types of things they give us with new updates.

95
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:51,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

96
00:06:53,869 --> 00:07:08,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in this case, when you have certain applications that their creators do not update them in conjunction with operating system updates, updating immediately is not a good thing.

97
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in the middle of working on a graphic project or a video project, you don't upgrade in the middle of it.

98
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:15,312
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

99
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:30,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I can think of several games that like the creators have just kind of abandoned them for whatever reason or I remember I mean this is several years old at this point but I do remember like when the 64-bit stuff became I think it was mandatory or whatever we lost things like Flappy Bird, RIP, Rest in Pepperoni.

100
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:35,811
[SPEAKER_07]: but Flappy Bird doesn't run anymore, and other abandoned games, basically.

101
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe on a more positive note... Oh, I wasn't talking about games.

102
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:45,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about my OBS, or my Logic Pro products, or my Final Cut projects.

103
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:50,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to already uninstall a couple of plugins for my Logic because they're not compatible anymore.

104
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Hanukkah!

105
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,873
[SPEAKER_04]: 4th Night, so we are smack dab in the middle.

106
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:25,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And number two, I was kind of giggling because you and I, out of the blue, apparently updated our YouTube channels today with new YouTubes about 15 minutes apart because I noticed on Blue Sky, I uploaded a video from something I'm going to talk about a little later during my game of the week.

107
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you uploaded a Dead by Daylight video, which I don't, I,

108
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,265
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a newer thing for you, right?

109
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:43,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I noticed it was like edited, like you you didn't like have an entire DVD match, you kind of like we're cutting and pasting the highlights, I guess, taking out the boring running across the map.

110
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:43,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

111
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:44,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

112
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:52,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I sped up a few things, and I did my first instant replay.

113
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:56,841
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a scene, and it was like a half a second, you would have missed it.

114
00:08:56,841 --> 00:09:01,367
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remembered seeing it when I was playing the game, because there had been

115
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:07,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I opened the locker and was just about to reach for the other one when the Yui got out of it.

116
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see her for like a split second.

117
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I remembered seeing her.

118
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:18,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually had to go back, freeze frame, put a cricket sound effect.

119
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,376
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why when you watch a video I make, watch it all the way through, please.

120
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And then... Like, comment, subscribe.

121
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:24,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

122
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:37,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it's very clear both DarkSakura and I are going to ride the coattails of LokiOLR's YouTube success.

123
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:37,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm teasing.

124
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:38,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm teasing.

125
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:46,580
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, Loki, you've had some good success on YouTube with some of the stuff you've been doing for Minecraft.

126
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:53,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I will point out that I have had my YouTube channel since about a year before Thunder

127
00:09:55,147 --> 00:10:06,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Big Thunder Barbecue I think we had you cut out again.

128
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:10,338
[SPEAKER_07]: You said something about Big Thunder Barbecue.

129
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:15,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I had my YouTube channel about a year and a half prior to that.

130
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:18,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Because one of your early videos is that, right?

131
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:25,363
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my early videos is Julian when he was three.

132
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:28,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't use it much, but I've had it for a while.

133
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:31,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like random gaming things on my channel.

134
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:38,677
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm like, Oh, I should actually use this nice setup I have to record like, you know, 2k things off my PC and 4k things on my PlayStation.

135
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:39,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of fun sometimes.

136
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:46,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well anyway, let's get into the news, because there was quite a bit of it this week, as Jason talked about in the intro.

137
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:53,774
[SPEAKER_07]: This is that kind of time of year where we get another bump in announcements, and a large part of that is thanks to the Game Awards.

138
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:58,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you know, usually we kind of recap everything that we saw at the Game Awards.

139
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:00,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get into some of the highlights as we get into the news.

140
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:04,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we need to go through the laundry list of all the announcements, because

141
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:13,122
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of what I wanted to focus on here at the top of the show was, well, A, let me just kind of get like people's overall thoughts, like for those that were able to watch it.

142
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:21,124
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think everyone here, I at least saw in the chat for part of the, I did a show with Bobby Blackwolf on Thursday, we did a co-stream.

143
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:25,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, programming note, Bobby Blackwolf was not live tonight here at VOG Network.

144
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,186
[SPEAKER_07]: He usually is at eight o'clock Eastern, five o'clock Pacific.

145
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is 100% A, okay with Bobby.

146
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:33,948
[SPEAKER_07]: He just had a personal conflict, so he wasn't able to do the show tonight, but he'll be back next week.

147
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:40,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, um, but what I really wanted to get into was the Game Awards.

148
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:45,398
[SPEAKER_07]: We were streaming that, and I saw DarkSakura in chat for a bit, and I saw Loki in chat for a bit, so I know everybody at least saw a piece of it.

149
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:56,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I'm kind of curious, like, overall what folks' thoughts were on the Game Awards, because there's been some very strong reaction on social media that's kind of surprised me a little bit, but I'll wait and get into that in a minute.

150
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:58,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, DarkSakura, do you have any thoughts?

151
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:03,284
[SPEAKER_04]: and into the channel to lurk.

152
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:09,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally went into lurking left because I've had a lot of IRL stuff going on.

153
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

154
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I actually didn't watch.

155
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:21,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And I honestly award shows don't interest me, even if it's video game stuff, because it's all arbitrary.

156
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:24,635
[SPEAKER_04]: The people don't really get too much of a say in it, you know?

157
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:26,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

158
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:28,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I wanted to watch critics,

159
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:35,485
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about video games, I would just listen to us because we're better.

160
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:35,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

161
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:38,047
[SPEAKER_04]: We're more interesting.

162
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:38,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what about you?

163
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,008
[SPEAKER_07]: How much of it were you able to catch?

164
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:40,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you like it?

165
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:42,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it, I think.

166
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:46,252
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it was good announcement trailer wise.

167
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:51,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it really got didn't really highlight developers too much.

168
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed very rushed.

169
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:56,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of it was very, very, very rushed.

170
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:02,121
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, that's kind of the nature of the beast because they got to pay for it.

171
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:02,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

172
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:07,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they don't have time for all that stuff.

173
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,466
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was very rushed.

174
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:13,489
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, some exciting announcement trailers and stuff like that were pretty cool to see.

175
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know things that aren't coming up later in the show like the Exodus trailer.

176
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked that one because that was the one that Matthew McConaughey introduced.

177
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:24,338
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I'm not mistaken, he wasn't in the trailer.

178
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:30,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I watched the trailer, I was like, I'm literally watching like Mass Effect with different aliens.

179
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:36,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this is this is a game by somebody who liked Mass Effect, who wanted to make their own Mass Effect game.

180
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:39,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, but I was into it because you know, you know, what's funny?

181
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like Mass Effect.

182
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that this is the

183
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying that this is like Fifty Shades of Grey to Twilight?

184
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:53,654
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, because it's like Mass Effect Interstellar Edition.

185
00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:56,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't look like awful fanfic.

186
00:13:56,656 --> 00:14:05,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked more like, yeah, like Interstellar, like actually, you know, say what you will about Matthew McConaughey, like Interstellar, like was an incredible movie.

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, yeah, like if it's that side of Matthew McConaughey,

188
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:13,427
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right, all right, I say to this this game is that that game look really good.

189
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:16,250
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, like, you know, I don't want to I don't want to focus too much on one trailer.

190
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,613
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just one that like caught my eye.

191
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:22,316
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, yeah, it was a lot of trailers and things like that.

192
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,599
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what the game awards have always been.

193
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:29,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And I I've been really shocked at some of the response on social media about people that are like,

194
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:32,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is this game boards are terrible.

195
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nothing but a commercial.

196
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all these ads and trailers.

197
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:38,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And they they give more time to the trailers and always rush through the awards.

198
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, why are you all acting brand new?

199
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:44,450
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like the 10th year that they have had these awards.

200
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been the same thing every year.

201
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:52,254
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you weren't aware, because you know, I don't know if you noticed, but renting out the Peacock theater is expensive.

202
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:56,455
[SPEAKER_07]: paying all those people to put on a broadcast behind the scenes is expensive.

203
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:59,716
[SPEAKER_07]: All the lights, the orchestra, all that stuff is expensive.

204
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:05,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And so yeah, they bring in ads and they do a lot of trailers to pay for all of that.

205
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So no, the focus isn't on the awards.

206
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:09,058
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't been.

207
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:14,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's, here's what blows my mind because people are like, well, we need the Game Awards to be nothing but awards.

208
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,740
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to see people give these full speeches, which I don't disagree with.

209
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do want to say it's not that I'm not here to

210
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,863
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, make out with Jeff Keighley and say his show is perfect.

211
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:25,343
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.

212
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,603
[SPEAKER_07]: There are things I wouldn't prove.

213
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:33,286
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, the optics of Wrap It Up after 30 seconds of a speech, like it was, it was not good, right?

214
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:41,010
[SPEAKER_07]: When they, when Baldur's Gate 3 won Game of the Year, and they were dedicating it to somebody on the team who had passed, and somebody in the audience shot how the Wrap It Up light was flashing.

215
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Those, the optics on that, pretty shitty.

216
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:47,955
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be fair to Jeff, he did acknowledge the day after that shouldn't have happened.

217
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:50,237
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll work on that so it wraps up next year.

218
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:55,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, with love and respect, blame Christopher Judge for that.

219
00:15:55,742 --> 00:16:00,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say blame, but I don't like that created a viral moment.

220
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, just let people ramble.

221
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:07,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, I know you're going to have to pay overtime or whatever, but maybe maybe plan for that a little bit.

222
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:07,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

223
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,694
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, the point I really wanted to get to was about

224
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:13,338
[SPEAKER_07]: the awards and people are like, they should just give awards.

225
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,540
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be nothing but that.

226
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, that they do that at other shows.

227
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And when have you ever tweeted, skeeted, bleated, peated about any of those things?

228
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:30,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Because did you know that there are DICE awards, GDC awards,

229
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:37,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Japan Game Awards, those don't get the same type of social media traction.

230
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:47,741
[SPEAKER_07]: 99% of the people, I guarantee it, 99% of the people complaining, saying the Game Awards needs to be nothing but an award show, have never posted about one of the actual award shows that are going on.

231
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Including, you know what, even the day before, the day of the devs.

232
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just saying, know what you're getting into with this.

233
00:16:54,873 --> 00:17:07,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the awards are a little bit of an afterthought to what's going on with the trailers and the announcements and the fact that this is a little bit of a winter E3, but the reality is you would not be talking about it if it didn't have that stuff.

234
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,569
[SPEAKER_07]: but could they tighten it up a little bit?

235
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

236
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:21,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought the OD stuff that Hideo Kojima debuted, even though they must've changed the name of that because I thought that leaked as a game called Overdose.

237
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:22,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember that, Loki?

238
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,502
[SPEAKER_07]: When that leaked, there was a game called Overdose that leaked about a year ago, right?

239
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:31,568
[SPEAKER_01]: OD usually means to overdose, so it's essentially the same title.

240
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess, but they've been calling it that, which is interesting, and then, yeah, I don't know.

241
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,457
[SPEAKER_07]: But that did go on a little long.

242
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:43,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the news that Jordan Peele is collaborating with that, I think, is kind of a big deal.

243
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:55,202
[SPEAKER_07]: But it also shows that one of Jeff's weak spots, I think right now, and overall, I do think he does a good job with the cards that are dealt.

244
00:17:55,202 --> 00:18:02,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think there's maybe some things he could stand to cut back or cut out and, you know, allow the speakers a little more time or whatever.

245
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:12,755
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, you know, one of the things I think he is not great about is that he gives a little too much to the film industry.

246
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:17,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do understand, again, Jordan Peele, big fucking deal in the game industry.

247
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:20,620
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact he's working with Hideo Kojima, big deal.

248
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we need to hear the whole bit about, I grew up on your games and the love affair and all that?

249
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, maybe not so much, but you know what?

250
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:29,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

251
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:35,708
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think then where people really start to get lost is like Timothee Chalamet giving away the Game of the Year award.

252
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:35,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

253
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,812
[SPEAKER_07]: why it did Timothee Chalamet.

254
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:45,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, even even Midna or one of the some cat has something to say about that.

255
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:49,501
[SPEAKER_04]: She hops up on me and then gets testy when I pet her.

256
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:52,624
[SPEAKER_07]: But why is Timothee Chalamet giving away a Game of the Year award?

257
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:54,686
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not he didn't even have a game out there to promote.

258
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:56,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, what the fuck?

259
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,328
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a YouTuber.

260
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:57,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Rob.

261
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it took me a minute to get that because they introduced him as a YouTuber, the Xbox 360.

262
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:06,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that was a joke like three years ago.

263
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:10,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, no, no, like he did not need to give out the Game of the Year award.

264
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:10,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

265
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is no diss on him.

266
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just stop seeking validation from an industry that you don't need validation from.

267
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:22,207
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, if you look at the latest trends in Hollywood, it's kind of the other way around right now.

268
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:25,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So stop seeking validation from the film industry.

269
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,531
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need it.

270
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:38,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So where I think it ought to be going is that the Game of the Year award, if you do look at the Oscars, who tends to present the Oscar for Best Picture?

271
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,262
[SPEAKER_07]: They get a legend out there, right?

272
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,783
[SPEAKER_07]: They get a Cher.

273
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:55,453
[SPEAKER_07]: They get a Meryl Streep, a Julia Roberts, Liza Minnelli, that was the one that her and Gaga came out one year to do Best Picture, right, or some award, but they get a fucking legend out there on stage to give out the award.

274
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:57,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you do the same for gaming?

275
00:19:57,715 --> 00:20:00,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Get Ken and Roberta Williams to give the award.

276
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:09,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a Sid Meier, get a Will Wright, get somebody who's like a legend in games to give out that award, especially because you kind of stopped

277
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:16,529
[SPEAKER_07]: that award for the Hall of Fame that I forget what they call it, but they used to actually Roberta and Ken Williams won it the very first year.

278
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:21,533
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a Vanguard or something they did for a few years, they got rid of it around like 2018 or so.

279
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:21,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So

280
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:24,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

281
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:30,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tigerclaw says, regarding Timothee Chalamet, he used to be a modder for the Xbox 360 controller.

282
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:32,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I get it.

283
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying not fucking good enough.

284
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And that meme is years old at this point.

285
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:42,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if you have to explain the joke, the joke didn't work.

286
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's as simple as that.

287
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:49,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I, I, I just think that was a poor decision on Jeff's part.

288
00:20:49,593 --> 00:21:05,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to see maybe more gaming legends and people within the industry, um, actually giving out some of the awards and they, you know, they were having people introduce segments of the, they, they try to mix up a little bit, but I just, you don't, you don't need to have Hollywood.

289
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,581
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need their validation, have that about the games.

290
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:08,701
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

291
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:18,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the optics of Jeff having Kojima have 5-10 minutes for his projects, yet they rush through everything else doesn't look good.

292
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:27,006
[SPEAKER_07]: But one perspective, if you want the show to have, say, fewer trailers for War Room for Speeches, they need those massive moments like Jordan Peele and Kojima.

293
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:29,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Moments help sell the show to outside advertisers.

294
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:36,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a big advertiser, the show will get that additional revenue stream that you don't need to have 100 trailers to pay the show.

295
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:52,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they could have tightened it up a little bit, but I do not understand some of the outrage on social media about a show that essentially has not changed its formula in several years now, and people are acting shocked.

296
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:53,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what to tell you.

297
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:59,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Questbusters pointing out that Xiaomei has a movie coming out.

298
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, weird flex for the VGAs, but I wouldn't be surprised if it had something to do with it on some level, too.

299
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:08,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they didn't promote the movie, so... And if there's a tie-in game, I bet it's garbage.

300
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:13,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Simu Liu is at the show as well, and he voiced a character in a video game, too.

301
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:17,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's... At least he's there to promote a game.

302
00:22:17,063 --> 00:22:19,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Matthew McConaughey, there to promote a game.

303
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Jordan Peele, there to promote a game.

304
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:39,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the guy from Twisted Metal, I'm sorry, I forgot his name, but he at least, he took a little bit of a long time, but at least I was like, oh, he was there because he was announcing that it was getting a second season on Peacock, at least, thank you, Anthony Mackie, at least he was announcing that it was getting a second season on Peacock, right?

305
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:41,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So at least there was a point.

306
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:44,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get the point with Timothee Chalamet.

307
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,376
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all.

308
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:52,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, DJRamaS says, part of the issue is that there's always new people watching and a lot of the complaints are coming from the newer eyes on this.

309
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:54,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there is that.

310
00:22:54,036 --> 00:23:02,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, again, some of the other optics are not great, because like accessibility and gaming, that award was given out during the pre show.

311
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:06,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like, you know, it's kind of, you know, rapid fire, essentially, type of award.

312
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there are people out there that would like to see those types of things uplifted.

313
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:11,482
[SPEAKER_07]: However,

314
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:16,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Those comments come off a little bit of slacktivism.

315
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:19,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I know people hate that word, but that's what it is.

316
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:24,926
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are not also out there uplifting those moments when they happen.

317
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:28,929
[SPEAKER_07]: So were you talking about the indie showcase that happened the day before?

318
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:32,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been talking about other types of accessibility?

319
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:34,092
[SPEAKER_07]: If so, great.

320
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:40,716
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of people out there that only want to talk the talk when it's convenient.

321
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,057
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just saying it's not a good look.

322
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:50,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I at the end of the day, yeah, of course, I would like to see more time for the you know, things like best RPG and all these things being rapid fire.

323
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:52,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not great.

324
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,151
[SPEAKER_07]: But what are the alternatives?

325
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,473
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not watching the shows that are nothing but awards.

326
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:25,798
[SPEAKER_07]: but I and I haven't seen I haven't seen the ratings for the game awards yet but I imagine it was a fucking lot of people especially when you consider just how many platforms that show is on like when you were looking at like streams in China streams and like all these other countries like it I that thing was going out on like 100 different platforms at once wild so I'm sure it had more viewers than most probably the Oscars it probably had more viewers than the Oscars quite frankly

327
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:30,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, oh yeah, Tiger Claw does remind me of a funny moment.

328
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:34,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Christopher Judge poked fun at that by taking a stab at Call of Duty.

329
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:37,881
[SPEAKER_07]: He said something along the lines about his speech being longer than Call of Duty's campaign.

330
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:39,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That was funny.

331
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:40,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I love a good read.

332
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:42,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was, that was funny.

333
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:46,006
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, yeah, if you're gonna get up and tell a joke, tell the joke, move on.

334
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:49,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, actually, Christopher Judge this year did great.

335
00:24:49,788 --> 00:25:03,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's it's funny in the sense that like haha yeah Call of Duty's campaigns are short but then also the developers for Call of Duty were like dude what the hell like you know that ain't cool poking fun at our game we're not poking fun at your game

336
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:16,624
[SPEAKER_07]: DJRamaS says, didn't one of the presenters get banned from the theater for life?

337
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:19,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the one that jumped up on stage in the middle of the Game of the Year award.

338
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:20,688
[SPEAKER_07]: He wasn't a presenter.

339
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:21,929
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a clown.

340
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So he got banned.

341
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:28,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, SJ100Matt says, folks were also disappointed with Jeff about not acknowledging the layoffs.

342
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:40,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think there was room to have a little bit of acknowledgement for that, you know, or something about maybe like dedicating a certain award or a certain segment to, you know, folks in the industry have been impacted.

343
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:50,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a nice quick little thing would have been great because he did do it a couple of years ago when there was, you know, a lot of other stuff going on in this industry that needed to be talked about.

344
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would have been nice to, you know, again, I think the way kind of Ben Starr put it in that viral clip that was going around Twitter,

345
00:25:58,115 --> 00:26:01,796
[SPEAKER_07]: about, you know, on one hand, yeah, we can celebrate.

346
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:05,737
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the other hand, it's hard to celebrate when dot dot dot.

347
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:10,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be it would have been nice to have an acknowledgement to that.

348
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I don't think Jeff is perfect.

349
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,540
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think yes, there are ways the awards can improve.

350
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've pointed out a few of them.

351
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that there's a lot of people out there commenting on it who very clearly had no idea what they were about to watch.

352
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:26,543
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that.

353
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:28,221
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

354
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, DarkSakura says, sounds like the upgraded security worked this year.

355
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:33,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, you could see it in the background.

356
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:41,806
[SPEAKER_07]: You could see that they had, you know, large men standing at the front of the stage, and there was little like a little barrier at the front.

357
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:46,688
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they only let two people through at a time, except for I think the game of the year, they let a few more.

358
00:26:47,128 --> 00:27:11,435
[SPEAKER_07]: and so forth like it was it was very hard to miss the extra security but like good because we didn't get a clown moment this year and that's that's the last thing we needed on top of everything else was another clownery to steal everything so well there is still the heckling or something in the crowd when Anthony Mackie was on stage and granted he did a terrible job and was just talking to them which

359
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:14,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they need to discourage.

360
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:14,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

361
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't, don't talk to hecklers, especially when we can't hear them on the stream.

362
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:19,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

363
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:25,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's why sometimes I'm like, if we're going to respond to a chat comment, we have to read it because the podcast, it's the same thing.

364
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:28,532
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could, you only have the information that you can hear or whatever to work with.

365
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:32,857
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that that was kind of a rookie mistake on his part.

366
00:27:32,857 --> 00:27:35,920
[SPEAKER_07]: But if he doesn't present awards every day, you know,

367
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:44,686
[SPEAKER_07]: sjo100mat says, easiest solution would be to extend the pre-show to sneak more awards in, but they're kind of damned either way.

368
00:27:44,686 --> 00:27:56,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I maybe would look to doing something like the Oscars, where maybe the night before they do, or I think the Oscars actually do it the month before or something like that, they do like the technical awards evening.

369
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:59,542
[SPEAKER_07]: and but stream that too.

370
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:10,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Just maybe don't you don't have to have the same amount of trailers or maybe you have some big indie announcements, some of the things that like we got a day of the death, you know, have it have a different kind of show and then do your big big award show.

371
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,849
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be their daytime Emmys.

372
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:12,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

373
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,011
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason not to.

374
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:18,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you make me think about Summer Game Fest.

375
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:20,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Move some awards to Summer Game Fest.

376
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:31,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially things like the eSports Creator of the Year, things that don't have to do with game design.

377
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,940
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you saying, Jamie?

378
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think that it should be a winter event because you are summing up the year.

379
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:44,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And anything can happen in that 6 month period.

380
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody out there is going to be quick to point out, oh, Rob, but esports people watch for that.

381
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:07,558
[SPEAKER_07]: People are watching for the personalities.

382
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:09,860
[SPEAKER_07]: People are watching to see their favorite name win.

383
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:22,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suppose there could be some point to that, but I, I would be very curious to survey a wide swath of Game Award watchers and see what it really is that they're tuning in for.

384
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:30,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bet esports personalities, not nearly the register that game trailers are, but I guess we'll never know unless we ask them.

385
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:35,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, one other thing to ask about our gaming week.

386
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:41,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So the types of things that we have been playing this week as opposed to just watching Game Awards on television.

387
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:44,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go to DarkSakura and talk about your gaming week.

388
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:47,034
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

389
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:50,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some Dead by Daylight.

390
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, I've been playing a lot of Killer lately.

391
00:29:56,857 --> 00:29:57,577
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did I do?

392
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:59,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Dreamlight Valley.

393
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played Rudra no Hiho.

394
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:09,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished Shion's first... Shion's scenario, and I'm on Risa's scenario.

395
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm actually really starting to see how the different stories are intertwined.

396
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty neat concept.

397
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:23,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played a little bit of World Cup Soccer Pinball.

398
00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:28,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah, that's really, that's really it.

399
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:33,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Did some new stuff for YouTube because I've been neglecting it.

400
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:41,441
[SPEAKER_04]: But mostly my time has been taken up by, uh, preparing for ballet recital next Saturday.

401
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:45,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and, uh, my, my new rotation at work.

402
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:48,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been taking a lot of attention.

403
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:49,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand.

404
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:52,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just had some days where I just haven't felt like sitting through a whole game.

405
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:55,163
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

406
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:07,867
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki, I know we talked a little bit about the Playdate, but how was your gaming week, Playdate or otherwise?

407
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:11,688
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I did play a few games on the Playdate.

408
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:19,110
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, the two games that come with it, the first unlocks, I guess, of season one.

409
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:26,352
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is one that's called Casual Birder, and it is a bird photography game, which is kind of funny.

410
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:26,672
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cute.

411
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one was kind of neat.

412
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,576
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a little like RPG that goes along with it.

413
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:34,197
[SPEAKER_01]: This one actually is kind of fun.

414
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:43,063
[SPEAKER_01]: It's White Water Wipeout, and it's essentially surfing from California games, except you use the crank to steer.

415
00:31:43,063 --> 00:31:44,485
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

416
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:49,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I immediately knew how to play that game, so that was awesome.

417
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:50,009
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

418
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:56,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did get a game called Gun Trails, and it is a bullet hell game.

419
00:31:57,802 --> 00:31:59,783
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard for me to play that.

420
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:01,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The screen is so tiny.

421
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:11,609
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, you know, vertical scrolling game, but you know, the screen's not a vertical screen and it's, you know, obviously not backlit and I'm old.

422
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:14,351
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I didn't do as well.

423
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,311
[SPEAKER_01]: My son liked it though.

424
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:18,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, it's a very pretty looking game.

425
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:19,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm going to check that out.

426
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:26,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I also got another one called P racing, which is basically kind of like a, um,

427
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:34,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the lines of Pole Position, that type of game.

428
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:39,695
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool, it's like a pseudo 3D racer.

429
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:41,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to checking out more stuff in there as well.

430
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:59,631
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the playdate i did play lethal company which is a brand new indie game kind of along the lines of like phasmophobia the premise is basically that you are part of this company to have to go raid these very dangerous planets for scrap and bring them back to this

431
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:08,864
[SPEAKER_01]: It might as well be just one of the old ones, a Cthulhu-type, monster-type thing.

432
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:25,930
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's certainly geared towards streamers and stuff, and the fact that there's just all sorts of dangerous things, you can't see anything very well, and the voice chat that's in there, it's all muffled like you're talking through your suit and stuff.

433
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a lot of fun to play that, and I'll probably have to go back and play that some more.

434
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:35,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, you know, Minecraft stuff, been doing that.

435
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,325
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the playdate, why did I get a playdate?

436
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:41,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the itch again.

437
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:42,510
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that itch.

438
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:52,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an idea for something stupid, but then I'm actually not thinking of doing that anymore.

439
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I may do something a little more straightforward.

440
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say though, it's a lot more complicated than I thought.

441
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:01,776
[SPEAKER_01]: They have various ways to code games for it.

442
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:10,134
[SPEAKER_01]: drag and drop editor type of thing that you can make some basic stuff with called Pulp.

443
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:12,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can actually code stuff in Lua.

444
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you really want to get more like performant, then you can do C. So I have to look and see how complicated a lot of stuff is.

445
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:27,768
[SPEAKER_01]: But like one of the ideas I was looking at it the other day, because one of the things I wanted to find for it is like, hey, is there a mini golf game for this?

446
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like that would be pretty cool.

447
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,471
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not a mini golf game for it.

448
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:31,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So like,

449
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:35,297
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be something that we find the play around with.

450
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:36,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm just gonna look at it.

451
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not committing to anything yet, but it might be something, you know.

452
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:44,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I did have, I had dumb ideas for that as well.

453
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:45,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

454
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

455
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,560
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

456
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious to see what you come up with.

457
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:50,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be fun.

458
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:51,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll see.

459
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:52,022
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

460
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited to hear you get in the itch again.

461
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:55,102
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

462
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:55,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.

463
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:56,383
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week.

464
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:57,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is interesting.

465
00:34:57,703 --> 00:34:59,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I've become a Fortnite gamer.

466
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:02,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and I didn't think I'd ever say those words on the show.

467
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:06,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I've tried Fortnite before, but I just, I, I, I'm just not good at battle royale.

468
00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:08,787
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I, I hate that it's,

469
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:15,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have like a tutorial I could just play by myself to learn how to play unless maybe that's in there now and I just haven't found it.

470
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they might have that actually.

471
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:21,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe they do and I just haven't found that but I'm just yeah.

472
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:23,865
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't really care for the battle royale game itself.

473
00:35:23,865 --> 00:35:24,806
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing.

474
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:27,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Now Fortnite has all these extra things in it.

475
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:32,453
[SPEAKER_07]: As of this week, they started launching other things within Fortnite.

476
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:40,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have, you might remember some time ago, Epic bought Harmonix, right, the makers of many different music games.

477
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:43,222
[SPEAKER_07]: And this week, they launched Fortnite Festival.

478
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:47,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's literally just Rock Band, but purple in Fortnite.

479
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:48,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Now,

480
00:35:49,279 --> 00:36:14,021
[SPEAKER_07]: there's criticisms to be had about how much they're charging for songs they have like a free rotation and you can buy a battle pass if you want to get some that way or what but like I I don't I don't I'm not spending money on that there's plenty in the free rotation that rotate in and out every day that I can get my fill and that's that's what it is you play it like twice and then it's like okay I've had my fill I'm not gonna do like a marathon session but like

481
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:19,526
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been kind of neat to just join like a random squad and somebody takes lead.

482
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:21,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody does vocals and so forth.

483
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:22,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And there it is.

484
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:23,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You just get right in the song.

485
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:25,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Def says, Oh, really?

486
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Songs are locked in the battle pass.

487
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:27,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it does.

488
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:30,815
[SPEAKER_07]: It does like a daily rotation, like a lot of games like that.

489
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:31,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

490
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:35,558
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a you have licensed music in a free to play game.

491
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:36,799
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to charge for it.

492
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:37,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes sense.

493
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,421
[SPEAKER_01]: It's granted.

494
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:42,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they're going to try to make a lot of money off of this as well.

495
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:44,325
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, it's not unreasonable to think that

496
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:45,429
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

497
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:22,490
[SPEAKER_07]: is that Fortnite is like a portal, and Battle Royale or Battle Royale Zero Build, that is the game that all of you are calling Fortnite.

498
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortnite is now a portal to all these other things as well.

499
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:28,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortnite is almost like a virtual platform.

500
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, it's like a PlayStation 5, but online.

501
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:40,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just imagine like, for example, imagine that Fortnite is Roblox, but Roblox actually making their own games as well on top of it.

502
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:43,615
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also not Roblox because, you know, Roblox is kind of...

503
00:37:44,372 --> 00:37:45,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Meh.

504
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is like that.

505
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:50,114
[SPEAKER_01]: They're developing their own games for this now platform that they're making.

506
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:54,815
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like indie developers as well on there making other things.

507
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:57,696
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a platform where they can do that.

508
00:37:57,696 --> 00:38:04,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what they're doing here is they're like kind of showcasing and also, you know, monetizing.

509
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:06,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look, we have a racing game.

510
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,078
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a music game.

511
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,939
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a survival building game.

512
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:09,919
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, you know,

513
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:12,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Battle Royale, look at all these things you can do.

514
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It's working.

515
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:17,403
[SPEAKER_07]: There were more people playing Lego Fortnite than anything else.

516
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:23,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And by a wide margin, like if you combined Zero Build and regular Battle Royale, I think there were about a million people.

517
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,708
[SPEAKER_07]: There were two million playing Lego Fortnite.

518
00:38:28,048 --> 00:38:29,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego Fortnite is Minecraft

519
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:54,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a little more what you would have thought, where you're beating up rocks to get wood, rocks, and then you go and you build.

520
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,847
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is a lot like Minecraft.

521
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:58,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Loki, you probably could give a better analysis on this.

522
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:08,259
[SPEAKER_07]: But the one part that's different is that when you go to build something big, you actually do a virtual snapping of different blocks together to build it, which I

523
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:09,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I did think was cute.

524
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:15,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was a cute little, you know, thing to kind of like, otherwise, it's like, what the fuck does this have to do with Lego?

525
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:17,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you did that, I was like, Oh, okay, that's super cute.

526
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:18,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

527
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:25,647
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I didn't play very much because you know, I was going back to the festival to get high scores.

528
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:27,627
[SPEAKER_07]: But I played through a little bit of the tutorial.

529
00:39:27,627 --> 00:39:30,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I went too far away from the base.

530
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:33,030
[SPEAKER_07]: And something like beat the shit out of me outside the base.

531
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, Okay, I wasn't supposed to be doing that yet.

532
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to kind of like start over I think.

533
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:39,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's OK.

534
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:40,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll do that at some point.

535
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:42,513
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a very interesting start.

536
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,314
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is catching a lot of people's attention right now.

537
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:50,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Loki, you had said last week, being in the Minecraft community, there's a lot of eyes on this, right?

538
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:53,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is a lot of the people that stream Minecraft stuff.

539
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:57,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, we're all trying it out because it looked interesting.

540
00:39:57,376 --> 00:40:03,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't tried it out yet, but I mean, the gameplay videos looked interesting.

541
00:40:03,038 --> 00:40:04,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly not as

542
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:12,653
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as in-depth as Minecraft in the sense that you can't build absolutely anything.

543
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:13,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of just like...

544
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Fortnite building, in a sense.

545
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:18,957
[SPEAKER_01]: You can build walls and stuff like that.

546
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:23,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can change what those walls look like, but it's very limited.

547
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,922
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going brick by brick and doing all that stuff.

548
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:29,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is fine, because sometimes it may be overwhelming for a lot of people.

549
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:33,165
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to build... I want to build a castle-looking thing.

550
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:36,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to think about which blocks I should use, what makes it look good, and stuff.

551
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:38,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to do that.

552
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:41,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine, because there's lots of other games, like Rust or...

553
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:59,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, there's other survival games like that, I think maybe The Forest as well, where you don't necessarily have the individual brick by brick building, it's just building walls and stuff.

554
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:01,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more accessible that way, I think.

555
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus people like seeing their Fortnite skins as LEGO characters, and that's also fun.

556
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:09,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but not Ariana Grande.

557
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:10,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Only some of them are LEGO characters.

558
00:41:10,826 --> 00:41:13,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of the big licenses are not LEGO characters.

559
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:25,516
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will admit, I loved having in Fortnite Festival the fact that Ariana Grande could be in my band and actually play guitar to Lady Gaga is really funny.

560
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So that part I enjoyed.

561
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:32,621
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTutsu in chat says I would be curious about the racing mode.

562
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:35,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's on my radar to check out.

563
00:41:35,624 --> 00:41:37,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't get around to it yet.

564
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:42,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Rocket League folks made Rocket Racing, which is now available in the Fortnite portal.

565
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:52,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So Fortnite definitely made a calculated effort before this holiday season to launch some attention-grabbing original content that is not Battle Royale.

566
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:55,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems to be working.

567
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,340
[SPEAKER_07]: At least it did on me.

568
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting.

569
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:03,466
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me a lot of like Grand Theft Auto Online, actually, because there's a lot of Grand Theft Auto Online stuff.

570
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:10,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you may remember they have there's like, OK, so Grand Theft Auto Online, you can do like the whole crime stuff.

571
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,072
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do

572
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

573
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:33,510
[SPEAKER_01]: With a couple people, you can do that as well.

574
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,033
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're kind of catering stuff like, hey, I don't like Battle Royale, but I like racing.

575
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:40,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now you're on their platform and you may play something else.

576
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:42,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, hey, I don't like you.

577
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:43,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I like music.

578
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:44,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play that.

579
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:44,196
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.

580
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:45,457
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the strategy.

581
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:45,737
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

582
00:42:47,438 --> 00:43:14,112
[SPEAKER_07]: you got to appeal to the people that like things other than shooters and they got me for now anyway I don't know how long the festival you know will last but it does kind of make me think there's going to be more there's going to be more along these lines whether it's by themselves but we know that Fortnite has opened its platform to other people creating original games and content so it's going to be very interesting to see what happens long term with this but this is a heck of a start I will say that um

583
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:17,185
[SPEAKER_07]: what else I want to say about the Fortnite stuff?

584
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:42,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I wanted to say a very interesting kind of observation too, if you look at Epic Games and their history, like this is a weird full circle moment in a way for me and you know, observing, because obviously, you know, being the old men, Loki and I are and I only include Loki because we've we've reminisced about this game on the show before, is we used to play the shit out of a game called ZZT when we were like, what, how old?

585
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:43,938
[SPEAKER_06]: By ZZT Universe.

586
00:43:43,938 --> 00:43:44,118
Yeah.

587
00:43:44,998 --> 00:44:02,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And ZZT, for those that don't remember this game, ZZT was a game that, like, it was all done in ASCII art, and it was an adventure game that you could go around to do things, but it had the ZZT OOP, or Object Oriented Programming Language, and you could build your own ZZT maps.

588
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:03,044
[SPEAKER_07]: ZZT

589
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:25,017
[SPEAKER_01]: They had, they used to have a thing for people that were interested in ZZTV.

590
00:44:25,017 --> 00:44:32,139
[SPEAKER_01]: They had these levels that people made that they're basically like programming examples of like how to implement some like really wild things.

591
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:37,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those was like a first person maze type simulation thing.

592
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:40,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was the first person shooter, but it was like a maze type thing.

593
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:43,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And like later on, like other games, you know.

594
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:47,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was thinking shooter more like centipede type of thing.

595
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:48,745
[SPEAKER_07]: That type of shooter game.

596
00:44:49,730 --> 00:45:01,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was shooting in ZZT, but yeah, I don't know about like actually like FPS, but yeah, you could do some pretty wild stuff with that.

597
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:08,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it was also the other thing, too, is like their main game or whatever the game that came with it.

598
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:12,657
[SPEAKER_01]: is like kind of a tutorial on how to build stuff as well.

599
00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:17,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had like a it was really exciting to be able to like just make your own things out of it.

600
00:45:17,502 --> 00:45:20,845
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really easy because it's just, you know, drawing with characters.

601
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:23,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you wanted to program stuff, cool.

602
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:27,633
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't want to program stuff, you could just throw down enemies and just do whatever.

603
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:31,617
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you really get in depth with it and do some crazy stuff if you wanted to.

604
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:36,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So the funny thing is, is that for me, this almost feels like a full circle moment.

605
00:45:36,258 --> 00:45:42,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can when you consider, you know, Tim Sweeney is the president of Epic, CEO, and he made ZZT, right?

606
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that.

607
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
[SPEAKER_07]: He made that game.

608
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So bring it back.

609
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:46,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

610
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,961
[SPEAKER_07]: For all the talks that, you know, there's a lot to see.

611
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:50,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to make this clear.

612
00:45:50,422 --> 00:45:52,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't particularly care for Tim Sweeney.

613
00:45:52,862 --> 00:45:54,663
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the crap he says on social media.

614
00:45:54,663 --> 00:45:56,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wish he'd stop using it.

615
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:58,504
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, so I certainly don't.

616
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:00,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Agree with him on a lot of stuff.

617
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:07,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not exactly going to put him up on too high of a pedestal or what have you.

618
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:14,756
[SPEAKER_07]: But ZZT was a very important game, especially for me growing up and it's very interesting to see this come full circle.

619
00:46:15,737 --> 00:46:22,681
[SPEAKER_07]: where now it's like, oh, now Fortnite is that game that has a base game, but you can program your own game in it.

620
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:28,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot harder, but you can program your own game in it, and now it's becoming more than just the game that it was originally.

621
00:46:28,965 --> 00:46:33,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very interesting, huh, kind of moment in games, for sure.

622
00:46:34,088 --> 00:46:38,210
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I'll be curious how many of you I noticed in chat.

623
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:43,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Bonds006 in chat says Robin Loki making a good argument for me to play Lego Fortnite.

624
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:48,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, it's we're not like you're not committing to like playing it forever.

625
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:49,274
[SPEAKER_01]: You just testing it out.

626
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:50,054
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.

627
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:50,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

628
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:52,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I need to go try it out.

629
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:52,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

630
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

631
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:54,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to sound like a shill.

632
00:46:54,236 --> 00:46:56,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe maybe we need an influencer code.

633
00:46:56,136 --> 00:46:56,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

634
00:46:56,516 --> 00:46:59,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to sound like a shill, but at the same time, it's free.

635
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:02,679
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got to lose besides bandwidth?

636
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:05,241
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's a concern for you, like, that's it.

637
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:06,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't give it money.

638
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:06,802
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

639
00:47:06,802 --> 00:47:08,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's you can check it out.

640
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:09,945
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Fortnite's free.

641
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:11,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the festival's free.

642
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:14,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there will be plenty of opportunity for them to take your money.

643
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:18,493
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you never input your credit card number, they can't take your money.

644
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:20,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So something to think about.

645
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:20,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

646
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:26,042
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on and get into some news of the week.

647
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:30,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to think if I had any programming announcements.

648
00:47:30,244 --> 00:47:31,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't right now.

649
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:35,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I still need to work with you folks off air on what the holidays are going to look like.

650
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:40,807
[SPEAKER_07]: But until we're there, let's just move on with the news and we will get into it.

651
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:44,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So Loki, I mean, all this talk of the Game Awards and all this other stuff.

652
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:52,113
[SPEAKER_07]: totally forgot there's another kind of big deal thing that happened this week, especially in your world.

653
00:47:52,113 --> 00:47:54,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you want to talk about this, Loki.

654
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer.

655
00:47:56,776 --> 00:48:05,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, it was released early even because it leaked out because, you know, that's how we roll nowadays is leaks, leaks, leaks.

656
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:12,847
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's definitely been viewed by a lot of people setting records as one of the most viewed videos, I think.

657
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:15,888
[SPEAKER_01]: in 24 hours.

658
00:48:15,888 --> 00:48:17,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had quite a few.

659
00:48:17,948 --> 00:48:23,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It beat out Mr. Beast at 59.4 million.

660
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't remember what the total amount was.

661
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:29,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 100 million people viewed that.

662
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:30,752
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot.

663
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:35,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100 million views in 24 hours.

664
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:38,141
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was incredible.

665
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:42,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when you consider that they had to release it early because of the leak.

666
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:45,672
[SPEAKER_07]: They still were able to shatter, you know, all these records.

667
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:47,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

668
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:50,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I think of it, it looks incredible.

669
00:48:50,104 --> 00:48:54,487
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unfortunately going to be a long wait until 2025 for when it comes out.

670
00:48:54,487 --> 00:49:00,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it is it is going to be groundbreaking as far as visuals go.

671
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:06,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, just even the animations, everything are just it's ridiculous to see how far they pushed it.

672
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,577
[SPEAKER_01]: A little disappointed that it's only a console.

673
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:10,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, I do have a console that can play it.

674
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:13,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that, that is a good thing, at least.

675
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:24,709
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah, it's important to say it's only on console for now because they know people are going to double dip so they can mod it when it's on PC.

676
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:26,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what's going to happen.

677
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:32,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it is going to be the first Grand Theft Auto with a female protagonist, which is interesting.

678
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:38,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know of two protagonists right now in that kind of almost like a Bonnie and Clyde type thing.

679
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny.

680
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:39,521
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

681
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:41,323
[SPEAKER_07]: The leak a few months ago said the same thing.

682
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:44,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it was gameplay.

683
00:49:44,236 --> 00:49:47,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would imagine that it's accurate.

684
00:49:47,036 --> 00:49:53,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know what this Instagram or TikTok parody stuff is because they have this full on like Instagram parody stuff.

685
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:55,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, dang, this looks really funny.

686
00:49:55,759 --> 00:50:01,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And like the guy in the thong watering his lawn and like just all and all of it is based off of real videos, too.

687
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and like they're all like inspired by them.

688
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:13,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, because if Grand Theft Auto is based, excuse me, if Vice City is based off of Miami, then you have to have Florida residents featured in the game.

689
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, TigerClaw.

690
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:18,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, TigerClaw and all our other people that live in Florida.

691
00:50:18,673 --> 00:50:20,214
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, it's true.

692
00:50:20,214 --> 00:50:20,974
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's true.

693
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:23,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

694
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:26,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, you know, along with that, of course, 100 million people seeing it.

695
00:50:26,978 --> 00:50:36,845
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it also boosted Love is a Long Road by Tom Petty because, you know, people listen to the trailer songs all the time.

696
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:44,190
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says it's basically increased the Spotify streams by 37,000 percent compared to last week.

697
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot.

698
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,292
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll get two more nickels this month.

699
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:51,832
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

700
00:50:51,832 --> 00:51:05,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so basically we were talking about how it's confirmed for just PlayStation 5 and Xbox X and S. I would not be surprised if it's just X only because I don't think it can run on S.

701
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:09,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably it probably is just a lower resolution.

702
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:13,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably only runs at 720 on S. Yeah, we'll see.

703
00:51:13,419 --> 00:51:14,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be surprised, though.

704
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:22,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be surprised if we get to that point and Microsoft goes, Listen, not everything is going to be compatible on both systems, but we'll see.

705
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:22,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

706
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:24,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I could be wrong.

707
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:32,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it is going to be a a long way, but I am very excited to see what they do with it.

708
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:33,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks incredible.

709
00:51:34,403 --> 00:51:39,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, like, you know, I don't super get into Grand Theft Auto games the same way everybody else does.

710
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:47,890
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't look at that and go, wow, the graphics in this, the graphics in this are fucking stunning.

711
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:52,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just like the amount of like pedestrians and stuff like they were showing.

712
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:59,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like an even example, but they were showing like, you know, Spider-Man 2, which just came out and their beaches are completely empty.

713
00:51:59,596 --> 00:52:00,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, it's

714
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:08,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that takes place around Christmas time anyways, or in the winter, so why would people be on the beaches?

715
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,487
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only the variety of the player models.

716
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:29,548
[SPEAKER_01]: The density of the different people on the beaches, just everything going on, like all of the animals, just like crazy amounts of everything in there.

717
00:52:29,548 --> 00:52:33,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only gonna get better by the time we get to it.

718
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:34,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the thing.

719
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna be very cool to see.

720
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:45,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well 2025, it's quite a wait, but that's if they make it.

721
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:46,459
[SPEAKER_07]: 2025 could get delayed, right?

722
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:47,219
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

723
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:47,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully not.

724
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know what?

725
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:50,341
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.

726
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:51,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time.

727
00:52:51,022 --> 00:52:52,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, honestly, it's gonna be great.

728
00:52:55,234 --> 00:53:02,695
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, this is gonna come out a lot sooner than Grand Theft Auto VI, I'm sure.

729
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:06,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I guess we don't necessarily have a guarantee on that, but I think we'll see this soon.

730
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:09,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the next Gold Master Series game.

731
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:17,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been talking about this a little bit because I really enjoyed Gold Master Series 1, which of course is Digital Eclipse, I guess now Atari in a way.

732
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:23,699
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really thorough Criterion Edition type walkthroughs of gaming history.

733
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:39,227
[SPEAKER_07]: and 001 was the making of Karateka, which was a great, you know, again, if you haven't checked it out yet, even if you don't care for Karateka, I just think the way it's set up as a museum, I think it's really well done and really worth your time as an exhibit to look at and check out.

734
00:53:39,227 --> 00:53:41,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've been curious what game is 2 going to be?

735
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,430
[SPEAKER_07]: What game is 2 going to be?

736
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And as it turns out, plot twist, 2 is not going to be a game.

737
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:50,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Goldmaster Series 2 is Llamasoft, the Jeff Minter Story

738
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:08,974
[SPEAKER_07]: There's of course going to be a Switch version.

739
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:10,974
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be on all the consoles.

740
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:23,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, you know, they say, Jeff Minter, weird, wild, 42 games from eight different platforms, including the Sinclair ZX81, the Commodore VIC-20,

741
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:37,053
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commodore 64, where you can play things like Mama Llama, Hellgate, Gridrunner was one of his big games, Attack of the Mutant Camels, Revenge of the Mutant Camels, 1 and 2, Sheep in Space, you know, these are all.

742
00:54:37,053 --> 00:54:39,095
[SPEAKER_07]: You get Sinclair Spectrum games.

743
00:54:39,095 --> 00:54:40,717
[SPEAKER_07]: You get Atari 8-bit games.

744
00:54:40,717 --> 00:54:43,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, Gridrunner, Attack of the Mutant Camels.

745
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,342
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the really cool thing.

746
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:48,784
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to play Konix Multi System.

747
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,486
[SPEAKER_07]: That hardware never came out.

748
00:54:50,486 --> 00:54:51,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It was canceled.

749
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:55,950
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the Konix Multi System, you will get to play Attack of the Mutant Camels 89.

750
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's rad right there.

751
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:02,935
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Atari ST, Llamatron 2112, Revenge of the Mutant Camels, Super Grid Runner.

752
00:55:02,935 --> 00:55:13,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one double dip from Atari 50, because Jeff Minter was a huge part of, Tempest 2000, and why that game was, you know, as unique as it was.

753
00:55:13,123 --> 00:55:15,005
[SPEAKER_07]: So you will get that in this collection.

754
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:16,345
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.

755
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:18,846
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a double dip, but I'm totally okay with it.

756
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:21,567
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

757
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:22,027
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

758
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:22,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Recharge.

759
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:23,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

760
00:55:23,188 --> 00:55:25,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Zapper Recharge.

761
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

762
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing that at Atari 50 the other day.

763
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I have yet to fire up Atari 50 with the extra games, but we'll get to that later.

764
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:33,451
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

765
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:35,392
[SPEAKER_07]: A little aside.

766
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:36,032
[SPEAKER_07]: A little aside.

767
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:36,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

768
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time either Dan and I grab the cat, we go, got you.

769
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:41,094
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one of us goes, ah!

770
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:43,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true.

771
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:47,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, which is a play on Tempest 2000 for those that don't know.

772
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:51,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, this is this is going to be a great collection.

773
00:55:51,092 --> 00:55:53,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited about it.

774
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:55,854
[SPEAKER_07]: They also do reimagined games.

775
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:59,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might remember that in the making of Karateka- First level music is stuck in my head now.

776
00:56:00,175 --> 00:56:01,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Light Synthesizers, Psychedelia, and ColorSpace.

777
00:56:01,735 --> 00:56:03,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Fully playable with all new console controls.

778
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Shroom's not included.

779
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:07,298
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew this coming out, but we didn't know too much about it.

780
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We still don't know too much about it.

781
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:18,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Behavior Interactive, the makers of Dead by Daylight and Supermassive Games are making a baby.

782
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,674
[SPEAKER_04]: A really hideous, bloody, gappy baby.

783
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:33,076
[SPEAKER_04]: What we had known before was that there was going to be a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe outside of the Entity's realm.

784
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:36,339
[SPEAKER_04]: But we didn't know that much about it.

785
00:57:36,339 --> 00:57:41,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was sort of like realm adjacent.

786
00:57:41,443 --> 00:57:48,629
[SPEAKER_04]: What we are getting is a game called The Casting of Frank Stone.

787
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:49,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean,

788
00:57:50,845 --> 00:58:01,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the guy, his full get up in the trailer just gives me the vibes of what I call the Trapper's Moltar outfit.

789
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:14,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old school welding helmet, you know, very Moltar from Space Ghost, you know, and with chains around them and a leather apron and all of this and apparently some crazy murderer.

790
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:29,660
[SPEAKER_04]: The website is pretty neat because you go through and you click on little clues on the main page and it walks you through just a little hint of the story.

791
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:35,043
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the trailer, and I swore one of the people I thought was Meg, but it's not Meg.

792
00:58:35,043 --> 00:58:39,745
[SPEAKER_07]: No, none of the characters from DBD are in this trailer.

793
00:58:39,745 --> 00:58:44,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but it was Meg hair.

794
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's her mom.

795
00:58:46,784 --> 00:59:00,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um, the, the trailer starts off with, um, and, and I do think that, that people should, you know, go spend a little time to watch it.

796
00:59:00,993 --> 00:59:06,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it starts off sort of like a film strip with the film grain.

797
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:15,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems almost like it's set maybe in the seventies or early eighties.

798
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:15,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Impression, Rob?

799
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:20,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yeah, I could see that.

800
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to tell from the little blip that we saw, but I could see that.

801
00:59:22,503 --> 00:59:35,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um... ...found a steel mill, and these four individuals are walking into it.

802
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:40,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I agree with SSJ100, Matt, it gives me a Grindhouse feel to it.

803
00:59:40,996 --> 00:59:45,860
[SPEAKER_04]: But they go in, and then they're caught up in whatever happens.

804
00:59:48,126 --> 01:00:03,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have a feeling that if the vehicles didn't give me a proper clue as to the age of the game, that I think that maybe some are flashbacks that might have been set in the 70s or 80s.

805
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:08,435
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a modern group going into the abandoned shutdown mill from what it looks like.

806
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:15,104
[SPEAKER_04]: looking in, oh, it's Cedar Steel Corporation.

807
01:00:15,104 --> 01:00:26,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one thing that I think is interesting is in looking through some of these screenshots, there is an industrial generator in one of the pictures that seems very reminiscent of Dead by Daylight.

808
01:00:26,308 --> 01:00:32,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I noticed the hooker or something like that, too, in the trailer that they had.

809
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:35,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that matters.

810
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:38,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it's cutting out because I'm still having RAM leaks.

811
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:44,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was gonna say, I noticed that they also showed the hook from Dead by Daylight in the trailer as well.

812
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:50,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's like, oh, hey, Tamsin, it relates.

813
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: The meat hooks are definitely there.

814
01:00:54,214 --> 01:01:04,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I have theories, because the last scene of the trailer, or one of the last ones,

815
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:09,713
[SPEAKER_04]: giant spider leg coming out of the sky.

816
01:01:09,713 --> 01:01:16,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that the entity is made up of 120% spider legs.

817
01:01:16,856 --> 01:01:17,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory.

818
01:01:17,537 --> 01:01:22,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory about about the story.

819
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:23,279
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see if I'm right.

820
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:26,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go for it, please.

821
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the entity was dormant.

822
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:30,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of dormant.

823
01:01:32,748 --> 01:01:34,330
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hellmouth from Buffy

824
01:01:52,814 --> 01:02:03,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the entity took and went to, you know, go through time and space and dimension and grab victims.

825
01:02:03,722 --> 01:02:12,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think maybe it was doing something a little bit different before, but the modern iteration, I think could have been this Frank guy's influence.

826
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:13,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

827
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes.

828
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:17,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll see in 2024 when the game comes out.

829
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it's what brought the entity to our world.

830
01:02:20,455 --> 01:02:20,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

831
01:02:23,715 --> 01:02:26,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, I'm curious to check this game out.

832
01:02:26,878 --> 01:02:32,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to admit, I like Until Dawn and the Quarry, although I watch people play them.

833
01:02:32,604 --> 01:02:38,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played them myself, so I'll be curious to check this one out and see how much it...

834
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:40,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I will play the hell out of this.

835
01:02:40,412 --> 01:02:46,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if they don't end up putting this killer because he just he looks like he could be the welder a new killer in Dead by Daylight.

836
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:58,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder if they don't end up putting him in DVD anyway as like a crossover or if that would be a weird like like they're they're very intentionally trying to preserve the boundary between this game and Dead by Daylight.

837
01:02:58,807 --> 01:02:59,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

838
01:02:59,347 --> 01:03:03,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Be interesting to see.

839
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:05,472
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

840
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:08,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we I would also think

841
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:35,025
[SPEAKER_04]: A narrative game that has to do with a survivor support group like people who have found evidence about their loved ones over the last I'd say maybe 50 to 60 years who have gone missing you know and this is kind of based off a fanfic that I read that I really like because like

842
01:03:36,257 --> 01:03:52,900
[SPEAKER_04]: In the story, they had all the survivors coming in kind of in release order and Meg losing her shit when Jane Romero shows up, who was, you know, very famous when Meg was still, you know, who had, quote, died when Meg was, you know, a younger, a younger girl.

843
01:03:54,649 --> 01:04:01,472
[SPEAKER_04]: or Jeff recognizing the Legion kids because he went to school with them.

844
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:12,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Just starting to put it together, but I would think that for the people who were still going on with actual chronological time, they have an investigation game.

845
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:16,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

846
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll, again, we'll we'll see when the game comes out.

847
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,928
[SPEAKER_07]: How everything relates together.

848
01:04:21,928 --> 01:04:23,090
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

849
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:27,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, let's move on and get to our next story, which is quite the bummer, Loki.

850
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:47,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Nintendo has decided to cancel its major event in Japan, so Nintendo Live 2024 Tokyo has been postponed, or at least, I don't think it's outright canceled, but they've postponed it to an unspecified date yet, because of course, people being the

851
01:04:48,649 --> 01:05:04,827
[SPEAKER_01]: beacons of responsibility that they are they decided to go ahead and have death threats or threats against Nintendo employees and spectators and so because of that they had to postpone the event because

852
01:05:05,953 --> 01:05:07,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

853
01:05:23,527 --> 01:05:37,994
[SPEAKER_07]: some people's children it's it's really unfortunate it's ridiculous yeah i i don't blame them for doing it but it's it sucks that you know they they have to take this abundance of caution in the first place because people can't you know can't have nice things that's it yeah

854
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:50,075
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's move on to talking about a little bit of good news, especially if you own the Atari 50 collection, which I brought up a little bit earlier.

855
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:56,640
[SPEAKER_07]: But we mentioned on last week's show that the game was going to be getting a free holiday update, and that update did hit this week.

856
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So we actually know

857
01:05:58,061 --> 01:06:04,605
[SPEAKER_07]: What free additional games came to Atari 50, which include Adventure 2, which was a homebrew.

858
01:06:04,605 --> 01:06:09,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Bowling, Double Dunk, Maze Craze, Miniature Golf, Moto Rodeo.

859
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:10,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were all for the 2600.

860
01:06:10,988 --> 01:06:13,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was Aquaventure and Save Mary.

861
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are also prototypes of the 2600.

862
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:17,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Football for the 2600.

863
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:23,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Circus Atari for 2600 and Return to Haunted House, which is also a homebrew for the 2600.

864
01:06:23,537 --> 01:06:27,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are some original things like the types of things you would have seen.

865
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:32,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of the flashbacks, I know one of the flashback consoles had Adventure 2 for sure.

866
01:06:32,164 --> 01:06:37,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, even though pretty much all of them were 2600, there is a single Lynx game that they added.

867
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:40,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Warbirds was also added to the collection as well.

868
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:42,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's kind of fun.

869
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:43,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think I played that one.

870
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:44,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

871
01:06:44,555 --> 01:06:52,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, if you have, yeah, if you have the Atari 50 collection, this is something you can pick up now, which is pretty cool.

872
01:06:52,703 --> 01:06:56,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not get around to it this week, but I'm looking forward to checking it out at some point.

873
01:06:56,968 --> 01:07:00,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love that it's just free.

874
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:02,934
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the low price of free.

875
01:07:02,934 --> 01:07:07,318
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on, DarkSakura.

876
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:07,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't.

877
01:07:10,223 --> 01:07:20,225
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is what I was referring to when I was agreeing with Rob about children.

878
01:07:20,225 --> 01:07:31,788
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, Activision, Epic, and other video game developers, including Roblox, are being hit with a lawsuit because

879
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:40,770
[SPEAKER_04]: A nine-year-old became addicted to games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto.

880
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:47,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It was filed in Chicago federal court on December 6th, so a few days ago for us.

881
01:07:47,612 --> 01:07:55,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It said that video game addiction is, and I'll quote, an epidemic harming our nation's youth.

882
01:07:55,133 --> 01:08:01,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to send in things to Bloomberg because Bloomberg has a typo in their article.

883
01:08:01,655 --> 01:08:01,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

884
01:08:04,011 --> 01:08:15,779
[SPEAKER_04]: feedback loops and reward systems that ensure maximal playing time by young users.

885
01:08:15,779 --> 01:08:27,226
[SPEAKER_04]: They go into microtransactions, they go psychology behind it, you know, using behavioral psychology,

886
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:36,149
[SPEAKER_04]: This complaint sounds like it's written like a tweet more, a tweet longer.

887
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:37,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to read this.

888
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:49,418
[SPEAKER_04]: The schemes use psychological mechanisms, behavioral psychology, and neuroscience to encourage repeated play and increase spending among users, especially among vulnerable populations like minors.

889
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:52,700
[SPEAKER_04]: They use those terms like they just don't know what they mean.

890
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:58,462
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these could be wrapped up.

891
01:08:58,462 --> 01:09:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that's, um, I don't like poorly worded things.

892
01:09:03,444 --> 01:09:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, uh, the nine-year-old in question who goes by DG, this is another quote, experienced severe emotional distress, diminished social interactions, loss of friends, poor hygiene, and withdrawal symptoms such as rage, anger, and physical outbursts.

893
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:25,093
[SPEAKER_04]: That he was playing, uh, six to eight hours a day across multiple platforms.

894
01:09:27,023 --> 01:09:30,564
[SPEAKER_04]: that other kids were having some of the same issues.

895
01:09:30,564 --> 01:09:49,988
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the companies are patenting more technology to deceive and harm society's most vulnerable, being minors, while lining their own pockets.

896
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:50,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

897
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:09,486
[SPEAKER_04]: They also say that claims that say otherwise are not rooted in fact and ignore the reality that billions of people globally of all ages and backgrounds enjoy playing video games and do so in a healthy, balanced way.

898
01:10:09,486 --> 01:10:10,366
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all,

899
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:14,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Angelili vs Activision Blizzard Inc.

900
01:10:28,365 --> 01:10:47,281
[SPEAKER_04]: There, there's a, um, there were other attorney, uh, their attorneys also, uh, file, well, their law firm, sorry, uh, Bullock Ward Mason LLC filed, uh, other addiction suits in Arkansas against the same defendants, uh, about a month or so ago.

901
01:10:47,281 --> 01:10:51,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

902
01:10:51,785 --> 01:10:52,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, I have thoughts.

903
01:10:52,986 --> 01:10:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, dear parent.

904
01:10:59,144 --> 01:11:08,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was it that set their kid in front of the video game system and decided it was going to become their babysitter?

905
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:14,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was it that didn't set up boundaries to begin with?

906
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:17,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is responsible for your child?

907
01:11:17,132 --> 01:11:17,412
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you!

908
01:11:22,622 --> 01:11:43,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that one expects the companies to have some sort of, you know, warning or maybe something like that, but I'm going to use an extreme analogy here, so hear me out.

909
01:11:43,456 --> 01:11:46,819
[SPEAKER_04]: When there is a firearm in the house,

910
01:11:48,818 --> 01:11:53,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know what you're supposed to do with a firearm to make it safe?

911
01:11:53,561 --> 01:11:54,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it to the cat.

912
01:11:54,362 --> 01:11:56,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no?

913
01:11:56,623 --> 01:11:57,303
[SPEAKER_05]: You give it to the cat.

914
01:11:57,303 --> 01:12:00,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuckle it in the air.

915
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:02,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You make sure the safety is on.

916
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:05,629
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it in a locker.

917
01:12:05,629 --> 01:12:07,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

918
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:14,174
[SPEAKER_04]: If you leave this under your pillow with the safety off, and someone comes in and...

919
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,781
[SPEAKER_04]: puts their head on your pillow and it shoots them in the head.

920
01:12:17,781 --> 01:12:19,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just throwing that out.

921
01:12:19,262 --> 01:12:22,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's at fault there?

922
01:12:22,483 --> 01:12:29,426
[SPEAKER_04]: The person at fault is the person that left the gun out, with the safety off, under a fucking pillow.

923
01:12:29,426 --> 01:12:32,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, extreme analogy, right?

924
01:12:32,327 --> 01:12:34,628
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it still goes in line.

925
01:12:35,638 --> 01:12:43,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the video game companies, you know, a lot of them do have a warning that come up, have rating systems on them.

926
01:12:43,243 --> 01:12:48,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they are now required to say if they involve transactions, right?

927
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:51,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so, yeah.

928
01:12:51,849 --> 01:12:56,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So then they have done what they need to do.

929
01:12:58,692 --> 01:13:06,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the point of their side of the industry is to make money.

930
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:07,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's capitalism.

931
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to make an entertaining thing that people are going to want to play and keep playing, right?

932
01:13:12,985 --> 01:13:20,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So whose responsibility is it that brings this device into the house?

933
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:23,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not set safety protocols for it.

934
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:32,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm surprised my parents didn't sue Nickelodeon under these same guidelines, because I sat there for hours and hours and watched Nickelodeon growing up.

935
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,073
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

936
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:33,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned out okay.

937
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:39,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a point, all joking aside, where my parents did set boundaries with that stuff, as parents should do.

938
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:45,936
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a frivolous lawsuit that just shows you everything that's wrong with the legal system in this country.

939
01:13:45,936 --> 01:13:50,638
[SPEAKER_07]: The law office that's bringing this up should honestly have their legal license revoked.

940
01:13:50,638 --> 01:13:51,858
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that frivolous.

941
01:13:51,858 --> 01:13:54,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we allowing these fucking serial

942
01:13:55,239 --> 01:14:00,802
[SPEAKER_07]: for profit, people that file these things, these, you know, legal things to continue to flourish.

943
01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:01,982
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bullshit.

944
01:14:01,982 --> 01:14:05,424
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like laugh this out of court the way it ought to be.

945
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:08,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, make an example of this fucking legal team.

946
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:12,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And I whatever about the parent, they are being used.

947
01:14:12,107 --> 01:14:13,688
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the lawyer's fault.

948
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:17,970
[SPEAKER_07]: The family is being used by these legal folks.

949
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's let's be 100% clear about that.

950
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:20,591
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what's happening.

951
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:27,892
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure that the parent had to have sought legal action to begin with.

952
01:14:27,892 --> 01:14:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So the parent walked right into it.

953
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:36,583
[SPEAKER_04]: They denied their own personal responsibility and are letting themselves be taken advantage of because of it.

954
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:37,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're both to blame.

955
01:14:37,664 --> 01:14:39,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And they see dollar signs.

956
01:14:39,806 --> 01:14:42,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm sure they've been sweet talked into how much they stand to make.

957
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:42,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

958
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:49,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not I'm not going to take any of that off of off of the parents.

959
01:14:49,621 --> 01:14:54,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not going to deny them of the responsibility they have for getting themselves in that situation.

960
01:14:54,004 --> 01:14:54,464
[SPEAKER_07]: No, sure.

961
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:59,847
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, they are when you when you give away your morals to get into an immoral situation.

962
01:14:59,847 --> 01:15:00,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you are responsible.

963
01:15:00,948 --> 01:15:01,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I do.

964
01:15:01,488 --> 01:15:02,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I do agree.

965
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:04,029
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not absolved of any responsibility.

966
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:08,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying it's the law office is ought to have ramifications here, too.

967
01:15:08,612 --> 01:15:11,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And they won't.

968
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:11,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And.

969
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and here's the other thing, too.

970
01:15:15,252 --> 01:15:22,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost the same thing that they're accusing the video game companies of, that's what the attorneys are doing to them, right?

971
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:24,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

972
01:15:24,658 --> 01:15:25,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

973
01:15:25,338 --> 01:15:32,142
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that this is gonna make them, you know, a tipper gore or something, you know?

974
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:42,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And get them the big media attention and, you know... I have a lot of thoughts about this as well, simply because

975
01:15:44,904 --> 01:15:47,966
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something that they're not also taking into account.

976
01:15:47,966 --> 01:15:49,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they say kids are vulnerable.

977
01:15:49,568 --> 01:15:53,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know why kids are vulnerable to stuff like this?

978
01:15:53,671 --> 01:16:01,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially playing a game that is for all intents and purposes under their age range.

979
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:05,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, nine years old.

980
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the other factor about that.

981
01:16:08,562 --> 01:16:12,405
[SPEAKER_04]: This child is not the target audience for these games.

982
01:16:12,405 --> 01:16:13,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

983
01:16:13,586 --> 01:16:14,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Second of all,

984
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:37,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has actually been shown, now it, this is just psychologically, chemically speaking, it lasts longer in typical males than it does in females and, you know, assigned at birth who were physically assigned that at birth, because that's part of chemistry.

985
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the way that the mind is wired?

986
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:44,282
[SPEAKER_04]: When you are a child, it is wired for instant gratification.

987
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:57,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're going to say, hey, do you want this ice cream or do you want to save the ice cream money and go get, you know, a Super Nintendo later?

988
01:16:57,384 --> 01:16:59,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I just threw it out there.

989
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:04,349
[SPEAKER_04]: A nine year old kid is probably going to say, no, I want the ice cream, you know, or I want them both.

990
01:17:04,349 --> 01:17:06,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have them both?

991
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,591
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest.

992
01:17:07,905 --> 01:17:13,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And the turnover of that starts phasing out when you hit your teens.

993
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And for most males, the top of the age range is about 27.

994
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:23,899
[SPEAKER_04]: For females, it's about 24.

995
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:26,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much of a difference off.

996
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:31,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has to deal with the way that the brain is wired.

997
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:32,707
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

998
01:17:32,707 --> 01:17:35,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have a child,

999
01:17:35,945 --> 01:17:47,502
[SPEAKER_04]: who is wired for instant gratification playing a game that is not meant for their age, well of course you're going to have a problem, you know?

1000
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:52,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go into the psychology.

1001
01:17:52,338 --> 01:17:55,220
[SPEAKER_04]: This is part of something I've written a paper on.

1002
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt anyone listening disagrees.

1003
01:17:57,382 --> 01:18:03,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just one of those things where you just shake your head and go, what a colossal waste of fucking time.

1004
01:18:03,087 --> 01:18:04,648
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, it's unfortunate.

1005
01:18:04,648 --> 01:18:11,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, I really was trying to avoid being insensitive and bringing up biological factors.

1006
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:15,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So by all means, that was not my intention.

1007
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:15,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to

1008
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:18,922
[SPEAKER_04]: to speak about biological wiring

1009
01:18:39,228 --> 01:18:42,010
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when you sell stuff on consignment?

1010
01:19:00,003 --> 01:19:00,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1011
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:05,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's funny though, when you read the comments and they're like, what the hell are you talking about?

1012
01:19:05,128 --> 01:19:11,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if anything, they're pushing more, you know, competition anyways, because on PC, there's multiple platforms.

1013
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:16,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, even within Steam, you can get codes in multiple different places at different prices.

1014
01:19:16,178 --> 01:19:19,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh God, it's so stupid.

1015
01:19:19,261 --> 01:19:20,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dumb.

1016
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:20,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

1017
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:29,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I never once gave humanity credit for having mass intelligence.

1018
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:36,753
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a handful that I think... I'm gonna just stop there, it makes me sad.

1019
01:19:36,753 --> 01:19:42,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's move on and talk about what's apparently going on at Bungie, Loki.

1020
01:19:42,856 --> 01:19:57,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Bungie apparently hasn't been selling enough of those, whatever the equivalent of money is on the Destiny platform, because they are 45% below their 2023 forecast.

1021
01:19:57,172 --> 01:20:02,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And as part of the deal when Sony had acquired Bungie,

1022
01:20:03,358 --> 01:20:08,460
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to remain an independent subsidiary, assuming they could hit those targets.

1023
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:14,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now, being that they are falling well below those targets, there is the...

1024
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:33,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, threat the possibility or real possibility that Sony is going to take them over, get rid of the board and basically run the company as their own instead of allowing them to maintain independence.

1025
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:38,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with that, though, is more of a cost cutting and cost savings.

1026
01:20:38,663 --> 01:20:39,744
[SPEAKER_01]: The company has been

1027
01:20:40,868 --> 01:20:55,356
[SPEAKER_01]: They put themselves in a hiring freeze, they have crackdown on annual cost of living adjustments to salaries, no holiday bonuses, as well as layoffs.

1028
01:20:55,356 --> 01:21:00,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this will only continue until, I guess, they get things under control.

1029
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:03,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that isn't great for morale.

1030
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,061
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know.

1031
01:21:05,772 --> 01:21:11,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, perhaps I need more education on the subject from, you know, people that actually work there and so forth.

1032
01:21:11,957 --> 01:21:23,104
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there is a part of me that kind of goes, well, after Bungie laid off those folks, and again, it's never, you know, the hires up to hear that Sony is about to come in and lay off the board.

1033
01:21:24,105 --> 01:21:27,989
[SPEAKER_07]: actually kind of sounds like sweet justice to me, uh, in a way.

1034
01:21:27,989 --> 01:21:40,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I failed to sit here and see how, well, that's, you know, I, but I do get morale, you know, and I wouldn't want to see, and I wouldn't want to see folks that are on the front lines be affected, which in this type of situation might be.

1035
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd want to be very clear.

1036
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:45,785
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only this part where I'm like, oh, well, if they're going to come in and sack the board,

1037
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:51,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would think that yeah, I would think the morale is not coming from the sacking of the board.

1038
01:21:51,748 --> 01:21:56,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more of the layoffs and the lack of of salary and payments and bonuses.

1039
01:21:56,490 --> 01:22:01,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they could give a damn about which are all reasons why maybe the board ought to be sacked.

1040
01:22:01,512 --> 01:22:02,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1041
01:22:02,192 --> 01:22:02,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree.

1042
01:22:02,873 --> 01:22:07,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens here.

1043
01:22:07,595 --> 01:22:07,835
[SPEAKER_01]: But

1044
01:22:08,962 --> 01:22:13,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, if it's under poor direction, then maybe that's the way they got to go.

1045
01:22:13,444 --> 01:22:17,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like I'm getting vibes of the Microsoft Activision merger.

1046
01:22:17,225 --> 01:22:23,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, again, not a big fan of the big fish eating the other big fish, but like getting Bobby Kotick out.

1047
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:24,151
[SPEAKER_07]: which

1048
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:46,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Redfall was not great.

1049
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:57,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I think Microsoft is going to be taking more of a more hand on approach with that studio and some of the stuff that they're doing versus kind of letting them do whatever.

1050
01:22:57,264 --> 01:23:03,568
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, since you brought that up, you know, they they showed up, that studio showed off the Blade trailer, which looked really ironic.

1051
01:23:03,968 --> 01:23:27,095
[SPEAKER_07]: which I I'm not but what was what I thought was interesting about it they they mentioned oh it's from the creators of uh uh Deathloop and you know that they did not even mention Redfall they did not they wrote that one off boy I was like oh okay so yeah but the blade trailer looked good well it's funny though it's like it's like vampire vampire game with vampire game I mean

1052
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:29,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I kinda thought that too.

1053
01:23:29,132 --> 01:23:32,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, so are they just like re-skinning Redfall?

1054
01:23:32,558 --> 01:23:36,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're not, but I thought it was... I also caught the similarities.

1055
01:23:39,684 --> 01:23:42,266
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we'll see what develops on the Bungie front.

1056
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:44,608
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be very interesting.

1057
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:48,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, going back to the Game Awards for a minute.

1058
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:53,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, y'all know at this point, if you've been listening to the show for a while, y'all know the types of games that I enjoy.

1059
01:23:53,616 --> 01:23:57,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And one game that I really enjoy is No Man's Sky.

1060
01:23:57,179 --> 01:24:02,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got to find out what is the next game that's coming from Hello Games, the creators of No Man's Sky.

1061
01:24:03,144 --> 01:24:03,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Light No Fire

1062
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:21,183
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe on one planet as opposed to an entire galaxy.

1063
01:24:21,183 --> 01:24:27,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember distinctly relating it to the third expedition of No Man's Sky, which did that.

1064
01:24:27,866 --> 01:24:31,048
[SPEAKER_07]: It started on one planet and you had to do all these things on the planet.

1065
01:24:31,048 --> 01:24:34,229
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot less focused on what you did in outer space.

1066
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:36,631
[SPEAKER_07]: And essentially, guess what?

1067
01:24:36,631 --> 01:24:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Light No Fire is kind of that.

1068
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:41,173
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes place on one planet,

1069
01:24:41,513 --> 01:25:03,714
[SPEAKER_07]: of course we don't really know everything because we see dragons in the trailer but we also see some more modern... it's like a fantasy earth I guess... yeah space looking things so we really don't really know everything but we definitely see some parallels to No Man's Sky as well the logo that you see towards the end looks a lot like the atlas from No Man's Sky so again I don't know if these games are directly related but

1070
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, this looks good.

1071
01:25:06,472 --> 01:25:14,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm really now again, of course, everybody is going, well, remember when No Man's Sky came out?

1072
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:17,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, though, that they have this many years experience.

1073
01:25:17,358 --> 01:25:18,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1074
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:19,539
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to.

1075
01:25:19,539 --> 01:25:23,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think they're coming from a much different place now.

1076
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:28,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would expect that, you know, they they they had a very important label at the beginning.

1077
01:25:28,144 --> 01:25:30,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And that said, it was captured all in game footage.

1078
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:32,706
[SPEAKER_07]: and a multiplayer and a multiplayer.

1079
01:25:32,706 --> 01:25:37,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So and they've been working on this for five years, I think they said.

1080
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:46,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do feel like they have kept it in their pants, so to speak, a little better this time than maybe they did with No Man's Sky.

1081
01:25:46,534 --> 01:25:50,697
[SPEAKER_07]: And a huge part of that is the fact that there's no Sony logo on this.

1082
01:25:51,557 --> 01:25:55,418
[SPEAKER_07]: or Microsoft logo, to be fair, or any other company's logo on this.

1083
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:58,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello Games is going to produce this on their own.

1084
01:25:58,458 --> 01:26:03,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's going to be a huge part of how they can avoid making the same mistake twice.

1085
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:07,640
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't put a release date on it, so they're not, you know, backed in anything yet.

1086
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

1087
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:11,161
[SPEAKER_07]: The graphics looked incredible.

1088
01:26:11,161 --> 01:26:15,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So I imagine it must be a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series game.

1089
01:26:15,662 --> 01:26:16,782
[SPEAKER_07]: PC, it has to be.

1090
01:26:17,502 --> 01:26:27,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it will be Switch, but if Hello Games maybe got their hands on a Switch 2, maybe they're looking at that instead.

1091
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:29,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's still a long ways out.

1092
01:26:29,452 --> 01:26:31,254
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, as a No Man's Sky fan,

1093
01:26:33,424 --> 01:26:35,125
[SPEAKER_07]: This trailer was hot.

1094
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very happy to see it.

1095
01:26:36,226 --> 01:26:37,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a hot trailer.

1096
01:26:37,346 --> 01:26:38,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very happy to see it.

1097
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:40,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm excited to check it out.

1098
01:26:40,668 --> 01:26:45,791
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what, Sean Murray and everybody at Hello Games, take the time to get it right.

1099
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:48,473
[SPEAKER_07]: It is all good.

1100
01:26:48,473 --> 01:26:51,815
[SPEAKER_07]: They also inserted a little footnote in there too at the Game Awards.

1101
01:26:51,815 --> 01:26:55,136
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not done updating No Man's Sky either.

1102
01:26:55,136 --> 01:26:57,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And they showed just a brief little clip.

1103
01:26:57,398 --> 01:27:02,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looked like the base that the ship was flying out of was way different than anything we've seen in the game yet.

1104
01:27:03,181 --> 01:27:08,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's there's still improvements they're making to No Man's Sky as well.

1105
01:27:08,589 --> 01:27:11,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's important to point out.

1106
01:27:11,613 --> 01:27:14,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Questbuster in chat says, I just hope it will be fun.

1107
01:27:14,417 --> 01:27:16,440
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1108
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games ought to be fun.

1109
01:27:17,782 --> 01:27:19,464
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree, you know, as much as I

1110
01:27:20,518 --> 01:27:23,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Stan No Man's Sky at this point.

1111
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:26,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree if the game's not fun, I don't want to play it.

1112
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm I'm it sure looks pretty.

1113
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:35,262
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks fun for my brain and my audio visual senses like ooh, pretty and flying.

1114
01:27:35,262 --> 01:27:41,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So Questmaster says as a side note, all No Man's Sky expeditions are running this month in case anyone missed any.

1115
01:27:42,579 --> 01:27:44,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed that announcement.

1116
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:46,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh, do you have a link to more details?

1117
01:27:46,442 --> 01:27:48,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on a schedule?

1118
01:27:48,163 --> 01:27:49,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm serious.

1119
01:27:49,744 --> 01:27:53,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking need to catch up on like every fucking expedition from this year.

1120
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:55,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm into that.

1121
01:27:55,627 --> 01:27:57,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Quest Buster, drop the link.

1122
01:27:57,068 --> 01:27:58,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to look at more.

1123
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:02,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I well, this is what I don't use the the bird app anymore.

1124
01:28:02,271 --> 01:28:05,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And I used to, you know, keep an eye on the No Man's Sky account.

1125
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I miss him if they don't make their way over to Blue Sky.

1126
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:08,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's alright.

1127
01:28:08,595 --> 01:28:09,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It is what it is.

1128
01:28:09,116 --> 01:28:09,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I

1129
01:28:09,676 --> 01:28:13,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um, let's take a trip down memory lane.

1130
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:17,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a trip down memory lane to a game that is super fun in our next segment.

1131
01:28:17,924 --> 01:28:18,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the bump.

1132
01:28:29,508 --> 01:28:37,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1133
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:41,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1134
01:28:41,013 --> 01:28:46,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?

1135
01:28:46,015 --> 01:28:50,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked a game that came out this month.

1136
01:28:50,716 --> 01:28:55,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me know if you're ready to start feeling like, huh, really?

1137
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:56,599
[SPEAKER_04]: The game I picked is Deadpool.

1138
01:28:59,329 --> 01:29:07,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we haven't had one of these pics in a while where it's like, this game just turned 10 years old, so it qualifies.

1139
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:08,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1140
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:17,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was developed by High Moon Studios, published by Activision, um, for Windows, digital format only, PS3, Xbox 360.

1141
01:29:17,793 --> 01:29:21,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in June 2013.

1142
01:29:21,293 --> 01:29:28,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um, it basically follows Deadpool working with X-Men, working with Cable,

1143
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:36,139
[SPEAKER_04]: and trying to stop a scheme of Mr. Sinister.

1144
01:29:36,139 --> 01:29:38,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Other stuff that happens.

1145
01:29:38,222 --> 01:29:41,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is totally a Deadpool game.

1146
01:29:41,466 --> 01:29:42,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Fourth wall breakage.

1147
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:43,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything.

1148
01:29:43,468 --> 01:29:44,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You name it, it's there.

1149
01:29:47,562 --> 01:29:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It got some extra views.

1150
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:57,830
[SPEAKER_04]: The humor was definitely up there, but the gameplay was not so good, and I can vouch for that.

1151
01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:07,919
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the games, though, that had the Marvel license by Activision was delisted and removed in 2014, and then it was brought back in 2016.

1152
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:17,547
[SPEAKER_04]: just through Steam and the PlayStation Store as download content only in the US markets.

1153
01:30:17,547 --> 01:30:27,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It was re-released on November 18, 2015 for PS4 and Xbox One to coincide with the movie's release.

1154
01:30:27,394 --> 01:30:31,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was removed again due to licensing in 2017.

1155
01:30:35,103 --> 01:30:44,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very hack and slash, third person, you know, um, you fight enemies with melee weapons and guns.

1156
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:54,737
[SPEAKER_04]: You do combos, you, you know, go through the story, get upgrade points, learn stuff, and, uh, basically just shit talk everybody cause you're a Deadpool.

1157
01:30:54,737 --> 01:31:03,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, some of his weapons apart from the guns and swords are giant hammers, plasma guns, um, furniture, um,

1158
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:16,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we know he heals, but in-game the way this works is that you have to prevent further damage in order to recover.

1159
01:31:16,678 --> 01:31:22,499
[SPEAKER_04]: You have stealth segments, you have to be vigilant.

1160
01:31:22,499 --> 01:31:30,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, if you use gun stealth, it tells everybody where you are because it's a fucking gun.

1161
01:31:30,641 --> 01:31:32,162
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of the plot of the game.

1162
01:31:34,227 --> 01:31:38,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pitch for the most awesome game ever, starring himself, and the studio rejects it.

1163
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:41,192
[SPEAKER_04]: The same studio that made the game.

1164
01:31:41,192 --> 01:31:45,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So he sets off explosives at the studios and forces them to cooperate.

1165
01:31:45,175 --> 01:31:50,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he hires Nolan North as his voice actor!

1166
01:31:50,619 --> 01:31:54,842
[SPEAKER_04]: ...actor in many things.

1167
01:31:54,842 --> 01:32:01,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, he goes out to assassinate this media person

1168
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:08,404
[SPEAKER_04]: basically blows his budget all in the first mission.

1169
01:32:08,404 --> 01:32:30,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, the rest of it, you know, uh, basically fighting budget issues while going through the rest of the game and recruiting, you know, uh, X-Men, uh, some of X-Force, uh, going to Geonosha, crashing a plane.

1170
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but anyway, um,

1171
01:32:33,908 --> 01:32:41,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna go too much into it, but it's there for a story and very Deadpool.

1172
01:32:41,531 --> 01:32:43,972
[SPEAKER_04]: The story I thought was pretty okay.

1173
01:32:43,972 --> 01:32:50,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It was announced in 2012 at San Diego Comic-Con with only a trailer, and people were like, yeah!

1174
01:32:50,115 --> 01:32:55,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Marvel let out the article about it right after.

1175
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:59,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was written from Deadpool's point of view.

1176
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:00,639
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh...

1177
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:06,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It went, it was like, I love how it was this total like...

1178
01:33:08,556 --> 01:33:09,336
[SPEAKER_04]: augmented thing.

1179
01:33:09,336 --> 01:33:15,940
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, no one special 77 who says, but are there chimichangas in the comics?

1180
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:19,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm specifically referring to Cable and Deadpool.

1181
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:27,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So few years ago, um, that he does not like chimichangas, but likes the word chimichanga.

1182
01:33:27,045 --> 01:33:28,926
[SPEAKER_04]: That is canonical.

1183
01:33:28,926 --> 01:33:30,426
[SPEAKER_04]: People forget that.

1184
01:33:30,426 --> 01:33:33,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't forget that because I know comics.

1185
01:33:33,368 --> 01:33:33,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway,

1186
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:38,093
[SPEAKER_04]: The game was created in Unreal Engine 3.

1187
01:33:38,093 --> 01:33:48,407
[SPEAKER_04]: The budget was $100 million, so it was one of the most expensive video games ever developed.

1188
01:33:48,407 --> 01:33:51,331
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a censored version of the trailer.

1189
01:33:54,001 --> 01:33:59,504
[SPEAKER_04]: They had an actor dressed up as Deadpool showing up on stage and everything.

1190
01:33:59,504 --> 01:34:04,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was some pretty clever marketing for this.

1191
01:34:04,427 --> 01:34:15,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually written by Daniel Leigh, who basically had been a longtime Deadpool author.

1192
01:34:15,772 --> 01:34:19,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, his biggest works were Wolverine Origins, Deadpool,

1193
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:24,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, some pretty good stuff there.

1194
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:26,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Worked on Spider-Man for a while.

1195
01:34:26,692 --> 01:34:38,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Bunch of different, uh, he also worked on Agent X with, if no one's read that series, it's a really good little side, uh, footnote in Deadpool lore.

1196
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:45,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so going back, uh, you know, there were, there were contests, there were all kinds of stuff.

1197
01:34:45,758 --> 01:34:45,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

1198
01:34:47,533 --> 01:34:50,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was successful.

1199
01:34:50,034 --> 01:34:56,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the game, I think, sold fairly well.

1200
01:34:56,055 --> 01:35:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I said, there was that issue going on with the licensing that I think really kicked it in the ass.

1201
01:35:07,338 --> 01:35:11,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it did receive some mixed reviews.

1202
01:35:12,996 --> 01:35:15,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, everyone liked the story.

1203
01:35:15,256 --> 01:35:16,897
[SPEAKER_04]: They liked the humor.

1204
01:35:16,897 --> 01:35:20,057
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was very true to the comics.

1205
01:35:20,057 --> 01:35:22,778
[SPEAKER_04]: The controls and gameplay were just not where it was.

1206
01:35:22,778 --> 01:35:25,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I- I- I will tell you this.

1207
01:35:25,258 --> 01:35:27,119
[SPEAKER_04]: The controls sucked for me.

1208
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,479
[SPEAKER_04]: They sucked.

1209
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:31,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and yeah, I did find it pretty repetitive.

1210
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:38,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you know... Part- parts also where the- the-

1211
01:35:42,921 --> 01:35:52,388
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the game and they actually mention this in what I'm reading where he leaves the camera behind and you have to pick up the camera and follow him.

1212
01:35:52,388 --> 01:36:10,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think just a really annoying part but I mean the rest of it was I mean for me it was the story and the humor in that that made it fun but the game itself that it just wasn't fun to play.

1213
01:36:12,206 --> 01:36:18,432
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to enjoy this game, watch someone else play it.

1214
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be honest.

1215
01:36:20,874 --> 01:36:22,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be perfectly honest.

1216
01:36:22,555 --> 01:36:27,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, Twitch and YouTube let us do that.

1217
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:28,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, indeed.

1218
01:36:28,841 --> 01:36:33,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that Hitmonkey was in this game, though.

1219
01:36:33,545 --> 01:36:37,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bob, Agent of Hydra, who is one of my favorite characters.

1220
01:36:37,628 --> 01:36:37,949
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1221
01:36:37,949 --> 01:36:39,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, is that it for Deadpool?

1222
01:36:42,571 --> 01:36:43,411
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Deadpool!

1223
01:37:08,946 --> 01:37:34,520
[SPEAKER_07]: all right that's science uh let's move on and we've got some more stories for you i know we've had some uh shows with less stories lately but we have a few more for you tonight uh we're gonna start it off though of course with some rapid fire news oh real quick i'll put in a rapid thing myself here because i was reading that link that um quest buster dropped in chat about the no man's sky expeditions so who excuse me burp see i had soda um

1224
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:38,042
[SPEAKER_07]: They are running for just a week a piece.

1225
01:37:38,042 --> 01:37:45,026
[SPEAKER_07]: So Utopia, which was the first expedition, is running right now, which thankfully I already finished that one or I'd be pissed I'm getting a late start.

1226
01:37:45,026 --> 01:37:47,647
[SPEAKER_07]: But there were less expeditions this year.

1227
01:37:47,647 --> 01:37:48,527
[SPEAKER_07]: There were only three.

1228
01:37:48,527 --> 01:37:57,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're actually rerunning one of them, the very first one I believe it was, which was Cartographers.

1229
01:37:57,212 --> 01:37:58,113
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to run

1230
01:37:59,113 --> 01:38:01,675
[SPEAKER_07]: The 22nd of December through the 29th of December.

1231
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:03,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So the week of Christmas, essentially.

1232
01:38:03,096 --> 01:38:12,682
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to be... And if you have never done that one, which if you are a Switch player, you didn't have the opportunity because the Switch version didn't come out until a little later.

1233
01:38:12,682 --> 01:38:18,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I would urge you to pay attention to this Cartographer's one because the reward is the Golden Vector ship.

1234
01:38:18,006 --> 01:38:22,669
[SPEAKER_07]: That is like the best ship you can get in your inventory to jumpstart any game.

1235
01:38:22,669 --> 01:38:26,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So that one is worth paying attention to, if nothing else.

1236
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:27,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep an eye out for that.

1237
01:38:29,246 --> 01:38:33,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um, let's now get into some actual rapid fire news.

1238
01:38:33,097 --> 01:38:34,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

1239
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:46,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so I think we even talked about that this was coming, but John Romero has finally released Sigil 2, which you can get at Romero.com.

1240
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:53,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically a brand new level pack for Doom.

1241
01:38:53,564 --> 01:38:58,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a complete new campaign, free of charge, the best cost

1242
01:38:59,848 --> 01:39:05,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and actually I think Sigil 2 is also, uh, yeah, Doom 2 episode is available as well.

1243
01:39:05,571 --> 01:39:09,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, I don't, is this for Doom or Doom 2?

1244
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:10,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1245
01:39:10,213 --> 01:39:12,334
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them it is for.

1246
01:39:12,334 --> 01:39:13,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's awesome.

1247
01:39:13,935 --> 01:39:17,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for Doom's 30th anniversary.

1248
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:26,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, along with that, uh, we have this really cool mod where someone has modded Wolfenstein 3D into Doom 2.

1249
01:39:26,301 --> 01:39:28,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, which is pretty crazy into that engine.

1250
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:28,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean,

1251
01:39:30,137 --> 01:39:32,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess it makes sense.

1252
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:35,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, yeah, with all the bonus levels in there.

1253
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:38,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes sense that you could do that.

1254
01:39:38,103 --> 01:39:42,427
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's cool that, you know, people put in games and other games.

1255
01:39:42,427 --> 01:39:44,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.

1256
01:39:44,248 --> 01:39:56,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember doing the level skip, and I want to say it was like level 37 or 47, something like that, was a Wolfenstein level that you would otherwise, I think, need a special door to get to.

1257
01:39:56,258 --> 01:39:57,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember playing that.

1258
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:58,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that, too.

1259
01:39:58,500 --> 01:39:58,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1260
01:40:01,058 --> 01:40:09,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo Switch Online has gotten some updates, so we have some brand new games, well, brand new to the service games that are available there.

1261
01:40:09,924 --> 01:40:25,213
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the Nintendo 64, we have Harvest Moon 64 and Jet Force Gemini that are joining, as well as 1080 degree snowboarding.

1262
01:40:25,213 --> 01:40:27,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.

1263
01:40:27,374 --> 01:40:29,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Check those out if you have the

1264
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:32,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have to have the expansion pass for that though.

1265
01:40:32,361 --> 01:40:35,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for those systems.

1266
01:40:35,883 --> 01:40:39,205
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

1267
01:40:39,205 --> 01:40:43,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it has been confirmed.

1268
01:40:43,148 --> 01:40:55,476
[SPEAKER_04]: No further sequels to the open world Legend of Zelda series, so Tears of the Kingdom is going to be it after Breath of the Wild.

1269
01:40:55,476 --> 01:40:57,698
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be no more

1270
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:02,702
[SPEAKER_04]: No more in that specific aspect of the series.

1271
01:41:02,702 --> 01:41:04,044
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's it.

1272
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:23,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, Aonuma said, and I'm just going to read this, as I've mentioned previously, with Tears of the Kingdom, we were seeking to build on top of the world we created in Breath of the Wild and really exhaust the possibilities of what we could put into that world.

1273
01:41:23,034 --> 01:41:31,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is, to use a bit of a term, an apotheosis, or the final form of that version of The Legend of Zelda.

1274
01:41:31,476 --> 01:41:36,718
[SPEAKER_04]: In that regard, I don't think that we'll be making a direct sequel to a world such as that we've created.

1275
01:41:39,462 --> 01:41:44,537
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone does not know what apotheosis means, it means basically to ascend as a deity.

1276
01:41:46,144 --> 01:41:49,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a pretty good term for it.

1277
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:13,252
[SPEAKER_07]: play into that hardware twist in one way or another.

1278
01:42:13,252 --> 01:42:21,397
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, Breath of the Wild was kind of built with the Wii U in mind, even though, yeah, obviously it ended up being a little more associated as a Switch game.

1279
01:42:21,397 --> 01:42:30,903
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, and then as DarkSakura was reading there in the quote, Tears of the Kingdom was essentially the best version of Breath of the Wild because it wasn't limited by anything Wii U, right?

1280
01:42:30,903 --> 01:42:32,464
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really only for the Switch.

1281
01:42:32,464 --> 01:42:34,005
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was that.

1282
01:42:34,005 --> 01:42:38,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think wherever they go with the next hardware, it's just going to be just going to be different.

1283
01:42:38,668 --> 01:42:39,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's OK.

1284
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:43,827
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, Tigerclaw also points out there is a little bit of a pattern maybe.

1285
01:42:43,827 --> 01:42:49,368
[SPEAKER_07]: There's usually like two Zelda games that are from the same universe before they do another reboot set in another universe.

1286
01:42:49,368 --> 01:42:54,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe kind of a throwback to like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask sort of thing.

1287
01:42:54,309 --> 01:42:56,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, maybe.

1288
01:42:56,949 --> 01:43:02,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else came out the year that Deadpool came out was A Link Between Worlds.

1289
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:02,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1290
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:06,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was I'd love for them to go back and do that kind of game.

1291
01:43:06,171 --> 01:43:07,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically the second

1292
01:43:09,707 --> 01:43:11,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, technically is the second.

1293
01:43:11,049 --> 01:43:18,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, we did get the remake of the Game Boy game, you know, so we did get that 2.5 Zelda on that one was pretty good.

1294
01:43:18,738 --> 01:43:19,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that was pretty good.

1295
01:43:19,939 --> 01:43:25,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's there's room for all types of Zeldas.

1296
01:43:25,767 --> 01:43:29,171
[SPEAKER_04]: If I recall correctly, though, I think that also is in the link to the past universe.

1297
01:43:32,137 --> 01:43:39,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't, well, the Link Between Worlds was, I don't think, uh, the Game Boy one was.

1298
01:43:39,639 --> 01:43:43,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they just did it in that art style for the remake.

1299
01:43:43,699 --> 01:43:44,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1300
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:49,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but, and they, they did that one, but then they also did, uh, Seasons and Ages.

1301
01:43:49,761 --> 01:43:54,102
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was, uh, there was that later, but.

1302
01:43:54,102 --> 01:44:00,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I was more referring, cause I know that it was just that they started making the game and then got the go ahead.

1303
01:44:00,003 --> 01:44:01,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be a little bit.

1304
01:44:02,475 --> 01:44:04,816
[SPEAKER_04]: are a little bit late on the date for it.

1305
01:44:04,816 --> 01:44:12,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually think that it was around Zelda 2.

1306
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back and look it up.

1307
01:44:14,276 --> 01:44:15,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's move on.

1308
01:44:15,798 --> 01:44:21,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a quick story here for Rapid Fire News, and it has to do with a new thing that they've added to Splatoon 3.

1309
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:26,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually causing some issues for folks with photosensitivity and sensory issues.

1310
01:44:26,388 --> 01:44:30,372
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the Splatter Color Screen, and it's a new special weapon.

1311
01:44:30,372 --> 01:44:34,396
[SPEAKER_07]: It creates a large ink barrier that will damage players when they walk through it.

1312
01:44:35,297 --> 01:44:41,564
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game will end up swapping from normal colors to grayscale and it has a sound effect that goes with that as well.

1313
01:44:41,564 --> 01:44:49,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean it all it sounds very interesting but if you have a photosensitivity or sensory issue apparently this the what happens with this can

1314
01:44:50,675 --> 01:44:56,656
[SPEAKER_07]: cause, and reports are coming in about strain, dizziness, migraines, and even fainting on top of that.

1315
01:44:56,656 --> 01:45:00,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And color blindness is also having some issues with the screen as well.

1316
01:45:00,097 --> 01:45:05,939
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Nintendo is usually pretty good about addressing these sorts of situations with a patch.

1317
01:45:05,939 --> 01:45:11,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully, you know, there'll be an accessibility setting, or they just kind of maybe change a little bit.

1318
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, maybe I haven't seen the effect myself.

1319
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,101
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if it's just too intense, or something what's happening there.

1320
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:19,842
[SPEAKER_07]: But as you should with any video game, if you start to feel unwell,

1321
01:45:20,302 --> 01:45:22,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1331
01:46:50,205 --> 01:46:54,928
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases December 14th on the switch.

1332
01:46:54,928 --> 01:46:56,609
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have a few things.

1333
01:46:56,609 --> 01:46:58,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it starts off with this.

1334
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:04,113
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to experience the shit show that is the Lord of the Rings Gollum, you're going to get your chance in Japan this week.

1335
01:47:04,113 --> 01:47:06,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they have translated it for Japan.

1336
01:47:06,274 --> 01:47:06,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1337
01:47:07,615 --> 01:47:19,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I do notice that the price to import this game is only $40, which is a lot cheaper than most import games, so I wonder if they didn't turn around and release this as a budget title for obvious reasons, because the game is shit, if you haven't heard.

1338
01:47:23,223 --> 01:47:24,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Kumaju Remilia 2 Stranger's Requiem Taito LD LaserDisc

1340
01:47:56,472 --> 01:47:58,953

1341
01:47:58,953 --> 01:48:00,874
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of fun and I doubt we'll get that here.

1342
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:03,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a fun import if you want to check that out.

1343
01:48:03,316 --> 01:48:07,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Battleship Yamato was Star Blazers here in the US.

1344
01:48:07,378 --> 01:48:09,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But have we have we had a release of that on Switch?

1345
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:11,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

1346
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:12,741
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know, maybe maybe they will do it.

1347
01:48:12,741 --> 01:48:15,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a game but I mean, yeah.

1348
01:48:16,474 --> 01:48:17,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1349
01:48:17,314 --> 01:48:23,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, looking at some other releases in Japan this week, we have Komajou, I'm sorry, I already read that one.

1352
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,760

[SPEAKER_07]: and Romance Train Cars

1356
01:49:20,802 --> 01:49:23,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Train cars would treat me better than most men would, let's be honest.

1357
01:49:23,325 --> 01:49:26,810
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, going to PlayStation 5.

01:50:09,967 --> 01:50:11,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fun!

1369
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1370
01:50:12,488 --> 01:50:17,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing, and I think, if I'm right, it's in the Toho series.

1371
01:50:17,492 --> 01:50:24,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, you are playing as Reimu, who is one of the major Toho characters.

1372
01:50:24,176 --> 01:50:25,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1373
01:50:25,637 --> 01:50:29,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically plays like Symphony of the Night.

1374
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,761
[SPEAKER_07]: We love us a Metroidvania.

1375
01:50:31,715 --> 01:50:39,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, but that was all I had for Japanese releases, so we can go to the UK.

1376
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:46,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's lagging a bit, so just try to jump in there when you can.

1377
01:50:46,944 --> 01:50:48,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's only one game.

1378
01:50:48,044 --> 01:50:53,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Hammerwatch 2 The Chronicles Edition on December 12th for Switch and PlayStation, and that's it.

1379
01:50:54,966 --> 01:51:00,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, we do still have a few headlines for you before we get to the listener roundtable.

1380
01:51:00,115 --> 01:51:02,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get to Loki.

1381
01:51:02,258 --> 01:51:04,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one is Wow, go ahead, Loki.

1382
01:51:05,373 --> 01:51:12,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So the FTC apparently is still trying to block the acquisition of Activision by Microsoft.

1383
01:51:12,077 --> 01:51:29,789
[SPEAKER_01]: They were arguing in front of the appeals court in California, saying that basically the original attempts to block the deal were held too high a standard by requiring the government agency to prove that the deal was anti-competitive.

1384
01:51:30,289 --> 01:51:40,802
[SPEAKER_01]: They fail to understand how giving somebody a monopoly of something would be pro-competitive, said their lawyer during the appeal case.

1385
01:51:40,802 --> 01:51:46,790
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be a benefit to some class of consumers, but that's very different than saying it's pro-competitive.

1386
01:51:48,812 --> 01:51:54,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hate that we have a government body arguing something that they don't know anything about.

1387
01:51:54,296 --> 01:52:07,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, because they're saying that, oh, it's anti-competitive for Microsoft to acquire Activision, but at the same time, there are many games that are released specifically to those platforms.

1388
01:52:08,385 --> 01:52:13,827
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, like Square Enix does a lot of those games that only come out on that platform.

1389
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:25,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and being that they've committed to having these titles come out on other platforms for at least like 10 years or something, it's ridiculous to call it anti-competitive.

1390
01:52:28,422 --> 01:52:28,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1391
01:52:28,922 --> 01:52:36,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they're still, why they're putting so much fuss into this and not like, say, the cable companies and overcharging us for internet because that's been a thing forever.

1392
01:52:36,925 --> 01:52:40,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about monopolies and anti-competitive.

1393
01:52:40,007 --> 01:52:43,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we focus on that instead of, like, video games?

1394
01:52:43,028 --> 01:52:43,548
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever.

1395
01:52:44,669 --> 01:52:50,254
[SPEAKER_07]: SSU 100 Matt in chat says a government body wasting time and money on something that's pointless.

1396
01:52:50,254 --> 01:52:58,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I perfectly said I mean, I get it supposed to be like, you know, for consumers, but like I feel that this is such a small

1397
01:53:00,285 --> 01:53:03,768
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a small thing in comparison to other stuff.

1398
01:53:03,768 --> 01:53:07,413
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, this may hurt one video game company.

1399
01:53:07,413 --> 01:53:10,056
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you look at how Zaslav is hurting Hollywood?

1400
01:53:10,056 --> 01:53:11,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you go look into that?

1401
01:53:11,037 --> 01:53:11,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1402
01:53:11,637 --> 01:53:12,859
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1403
01:53:12,859 --> 01:53:15,181
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that they could be looking into.

1404
01:53:16,002 --> 01:53:20,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just don't see why they're so dead set on like, stopping this, but okay.

1405
01:53:20,305 --> 01:53:26,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you look into, why don't you look into, um, God, what was, uh, what was the great nickname I heard for him today?

1406
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:29,911
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, you all know the guy I hate that owns Twitter at this point.

1407
01:53:29,911 --> 01:53:32,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they, uh, oh, Phony Stark.

1408
01:53:32,413 --> 01:53:33,493
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the name I heard.

1409
01:53:33,493 --> 01:53:34,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha, Phony Stark.

1410
01:53:34,754 --> 01:53:38,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they look into Phony Stark and how the fuck he's allowed to hang onto this platform?

1411
01:53:38,897 --> 01:53:41,318
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many other things that they could be looking into.

1412
01:53:41,318 --> 01:53:41,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Like why,

1413
01:53:42,699 --> 01:53:45,262
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura with an update on Twitch culture

1414
01:54:06,823 --> 01:54:10,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, they are shutting down in South Korea.

1415
01:54:10,506 --> 01:54:19,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are going to be ending at the end of February 2027 and basically said it's too damn expensive.

1416
01:54:19,172 --> 01:54:27,358
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that it will work to help their streamers that are based in South Korea move their communities to alternative live streaming services.

1417
01:54:28,478 --> 01:54:33,362
[SPEAKER_04]: and said that it was very difficult to suspend their business there.

1418
01:54:33,362 --> 01:54:40,187
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been operating at a significant loss and that it's basically 10 times more expensive than other countries.

1419
01:54:40,187 --> 01:54:50,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though they've tried to reduce the cost a lot, including limiting their source quality to 720p, it hasn't helped them recoup any.

1420
01:54:50,695 --> 01:54:50,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So

1421
01:54:53,706 --> 01:54:58,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'm going to say this, just something about the article that I like.

1422
01:54:58,351 --> 01:55:03,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how many are saying the statement on, you know, Letter, formerly known as Twitter?

1423
01:55:03,757 --> 01:55:06,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that this one uses, nay, Twitter.

1424
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's made a name.

1425
01:55:10,925 --> 01:55:12,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a lot of streamers reacting to this.

1426
01:55:12,626 --> 01:55:12,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Truly sucks.

1427
01:55:12,966 --> 01:55:14,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of them felt like they were essentially fired.

1428
01:55:33,837 --> 01:55:46,086
[SPEAKER_07]: It does sound like though the cost of it and I'm I'm not up to date on these types of situations, but it sounds like the bandwidth in South Korea is a lot more and you kind of said that you outlined the 10 times more expensive and so forth.

1429
01:55:46,086 --> 01:55:49,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just that the bandwidth costs for whatever reasons are higher.

1430
01:55:49,028 --> 01:55:53,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe this is something I can't can they pressure the government?

1431
01:55:53,632 --> 01:55:53,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me?

1432
01:55:55,353 --> 01:55:56,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Too much soda.

1433
01:55:56,633 --> 01:56:00,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Can they pressure the government to try to lower bandwidth and make it more accessible?

1434
01:56:00,794 --> 01:56:01,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

1435
01:56:01,334 --> 01:56:07,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the ploy to try to get people to petition lawmakers to regulate this and make it cheaper?

1436
01:56:07,156 --> 01:56:16,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's even a thing, but sometimes companies will make moves like this to try to get upset people to effect change in other ways.

1437
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:20,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, Loki.

1438
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:51,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so we have news now that Alone in the Dark, the remake has been postponed to March 20th, 2024 to avoid crunch.

1439
01:56:51,240 --> 01:57:00,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So THQ Nordic basically, they've said that to avoid any potential crunch over the Christmas holidays.

1440
01:57:00,143 --> 01:57:02,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is that going to be crunched towards March?

1441
01:57:02,363 --> 01:57:02,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

1442
01:57:02,903 --> 01:57:09,105
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least over the Christmas holidays, they are going to be giving them more time to put the game together.

1443
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good.

1444
01:57:11,718 --> 01:57:12,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is good news.

1445
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:20,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy holidays to all the employees there, you know, and especially when I believe THQ Nordic's been in the news for a lot of other interesting things lately.

1446
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:23,173
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, this is a welcome change of pace.

1447
01:57:23,173 --> 01:57:26,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, if that's what has to be done for the game to be right, good.

1448
01:57:27,299 --> 01:57:28,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Justin is in our chat right now.

1449
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:31,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, friends, saying avoiding crunch is always a good thing.

1450
01:57:31,822 --> 01:57:33,584
[SPEAKER_07]: There are plenty of games to play right now.

1451
01:57:33,584 --> 01:57:34,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that the truth?

1452
01:57:34,925 --> 01:57:35,706
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty.

1453
01:57:35,706 --> 01:57:37,947
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty of stuff to play.

1454
01:57:37,947 --> 01:57:42,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And now games are birthing games inside games.

1455
01:57:42,411 --> 01:57:49,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can always go play more things in Fortnite if you want or whatever, Roblox, whatever the hell it is you're into.

1456
01:57:49,897 --> 01:57:52,380
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got games within a game at this point.

1457
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:53,500
[SPEAKER_07]: There is your backlog.

1458
01:57:54,302 --> 01:57:57,133
[SPEAKER_07]: is too fucking big right now.

1459
01:57:57,133 --> 01:57:59,844
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need Alone in the Dark on top of everything else.

1460
01:58:02,236 --> 01:58:18,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, one more story I have for you, and that has to do with, hey, Hideo Kojima, all the rage this week, and did you know that there's actually a documentary that Hideo Kojima is actually putting together on himself, of course, called Hideo Kojima Connecting Worlds.

1461
01:58:18,888 --> 01:58:25,013
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be exclusively released in Disney+, here in America.

1462
01:58:25,013 --> 01:58:27,074
[SPEAKER_07]: He posted on, nay, Twitter,

1463
01:58:28,115 --> 01:58:35,460
[SPEAKER_07]: that the film, which has already been shown at the Tribeca Film Festival, will launch globally in the spring of 2024.

1464
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:44,966
[SPEAKER_07]: In the movie, it goes over the development of Death Stranding, and you actually get to see part of the creative process as he was launching his own independent studio.

1465
01:58:44,966 --> 01:58:52,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, there are shots from the early days of independent studio, memories from childhood and the creative journey, so he's tried to put a lot of this in here.

1466
01:58:55,436 --> 01:59:06,827
[SPEAKER_07]: No word if it says anything about upcoming games, but seeing as we already know the movie debuted at Tribeca Film Festival, I don't think it does, unless they maybe added something to it, but I wouldn't go in expecting that.

1467
01:59:06,827 --> 01:59:12,953
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have now, I know when we saw that, what?

1468
01:59:12,953 --> 01:59:14,755
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have a watch and react party.

1469
01:59:16,016 --> 01:59:19,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, maybe it can be hard because it's a copyright thing.

1470
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:23,301
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was on Amazon, we could do one of those watch party things.

1471
01:59:23,301 --> 01:59:26,464
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's harder to do a Disney plus because it would technically be copyright.

1472
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:34,009
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could do like one of those things where it's like audio commentary or press play now type of thing.

1473
01:59:34,009 --> 01:59:36,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we wouldn't be able to do something live, unfortunately, copyright.

1474
01:59:39,215 --> 01:59:41,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I just meant us watching it and making fun of it.

1475
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:43,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought you meant and put it on the internet.

1476
01:59:43,563 --> 01:59:46,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if it's just us, then fine.

1477
01:59:46,227 --> 01:59:48,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to point out because... We can do that.

1478
01:59:48,692 --> 01:59:50,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know that there are ways of getting around it.

1479
01:59:50,905 --> 01:59:57,971
[SPEAKER_07]: When the OD trailer debuted, we had Deft in our chat was talking about it needs to have Guillermo del Toro in it.

1480
01:59:57,971 --> 01:59:58,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess what?

1481
01:59:58,592 --> 01:59:59,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Good news for you, Deft.

1482
01:59:59,533 --> 02:00:03,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Guillermo del Toro is in this documentary.

1483
02:00:03,156 --> 02:00:06,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Video gaming is an art, says Guillermo del Toro in the trailer.

1484
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:11,183
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only person in charge of the orchestra is the auteur.

1485
02:00:11,183 --> 02:00:15,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So check out that documentary when it comes out if you have Disney+.

1486
02:00:15,427 --> 02:00:17,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't have Disney+, I guess you'll pirate it.

1487
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:22,273
[SPEAKER_07]: DejiramS points out private watch party in Discord.

1488
02:00:22,273 --> 02:00:26,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's a gray area, but maybe.

1489
02:00:26,597 --> 02:00:30,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, OrangeRite calls it VOGtracks.

1490
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:33,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Cute.

1491
02:00:33,542 --> 02:00:37,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing you were saying, just you know, hit play at the same time and everyone watch it.

1492
02:00:37,866 --> 02:00:38,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1493
02:00:38,806 --> 02:00:40,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we could do that.

1494
02:00:40,027 --> 02:00:43,150
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like that Netflix party on Xbox 360 was the best thing ever.

1495
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:46,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was essentially that so you do have that.

1496
02:00:47,748 --> 02:00:50,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, believe it or not, that was our last scheduled story tonight.

1497
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:54,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So we now invite interaction from all of you.

1498
02:00:54,072 --> 02:00:58,695
[SPEAKER_07]: We always invite your emails and participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1499
02:00:58,695 --> 02:01:02,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there was anything that there was a actually I should have went in and deleted it, Jamie.

1500
02:01:02,658 --> 02:01:06,240
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a really well done marketing email in there.

1501
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:09,182
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like it's addressed to you and I deleted everything.

1502
02:01:09,182 --> 02:01:10,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It calls out the show.

1503
02:01:10,663 --> 02:01:12,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was it was it was marketing.

1504
02:01:12,244 --> 02:01:15,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was like, wow, this person actually their database is very good.

1505
02:01:15,907 --> 02:01:17,008
[SPEAKER_07]: That scrapes all the info.

1506
02:01:19,609 --> 02:01:20,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

1507
02:01:20,949 --> 02:01:22,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I have looked at this?

1508
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:24,910
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because it's nothing we're interested in.

1509
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:27,511
[SPEAKER_07]: It was it was for like a caffeine drink or something.

1510
02:01:27,511 --> 02:01:43,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was like, Wow, I think I was like to chat to help because it actually incorporated parts of our podcast description that talked about you won these podcast awards for all the things that are in our description.

1511
02:01:43,857 --> 02:01:44,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like,

1512
02:01:45,359 --> 02:01:51,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, like, yeah, I'm very happy with those awards, but they were like over 10 years ago.

1513
02:01:51,022 --> 02:01:59,827
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, it just felt very chat GPT generated, like write an invite for this podcast based on their description.

1514
02:01:59,827 --> 02:02:02,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, get that.

1515
02:02:02,668 --> 02:02:03,369
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1516
02:02:03,369 --> 02:02:03,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1517
02:02:04,778 --> 02:02:11,242
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will invite your calls as well over at, uh, vognetwork.com slash discord.

1518
02:02:11,242 --> 02:02:16,765
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to call in and it appears we have a caller who is waiting right there to be on the program tonight.

1519
02:02:16,765 --> 02:02:18,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go and say hello.

1520
02:02:18,887 --> 02:02:19,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi caller.

1521
02:02:19,707 --> 02:02:20,307
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on the air.

1522
02:02:20,307 --> 02:02:21,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1523
02:02:21,928 --> 02:02:25,951
[SPEAKER_02]: The one and only DJ Ron S and let me go ahead and turn my camera on and go.

1524
02:02:25,951 --> 02:02:27,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everybody.

1525
02:02:27,011 --> 02:02:27,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yay.

1526
02:02:27,492 --> 02:02:27,912
[SPEAKER_07]: We love it.

1527
02:02:27,912 --> 02:02:29,113
[SPEAKER_07]: When you actually get on the cam.

1528
02:02:29,113 --> 02:02:30,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Rama, good to see you.

1529
02:02:30,253 --> 02:02:30,654
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

1530
02:02:31,596 --> 02:02:32,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

1531
02:02:32,417 --> 02:02:34,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I've spent half the day packing.

1532
02:02:34,839 --> 02:02:36,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know.

1533
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:37,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

1534
02:02:37,361 --> 02:02:39,222
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going on your big trip real soon.

1535
02:02:39,222 --> 02:02:40,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Like real soon.

1536
02:02:40,784 --> 02:02:41,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1537
02:02:41,845 --> 02:02:49,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So since you brought it up, I'm assuming we're okay to talk about the fact that you're going to Japan, uh, in a matter of days, I'm really excited for you.

1538
02:02:49,771 --> 02:02:58,138
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what, what are some of like the big, don't tell us everything cause it's only a three hour show, but what are some of the big highlights that you're planning on doing when you're in Japan?

1539
02:02:58,138 --> 02:03:00,440
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a lot of things, but,

1540
02:03:01,516 --> 02:03:13,461
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I plan to do once I've gotten some energy in me, and I fully checked in the hotel and so forth, I am going to do a pilgrimage.

1541
02:03:13,461 --> 02:03:23,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be going to the Nerima Ward, and I'll be walking around that entire neighborhood that's because where Ranma 1 half took place.

1542
02:03:23,166 --> 02:03:23,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1543
02:03:23,846 --> 02:03:25,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Cute.

1544
02:03:25,787 --> 02:03:28,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have to take pictures from the Odaiba Bridge for me.

1545
02:03:28,848 --> 02:03:29,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

1546
02:03:29,448 --> 02:03:30,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I will add that to my notes.

1547
02:03:32,383 --> 02:03:34,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been to Japan before?

1548
02:03:34,184 --> 02:03:36,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Digimon fan.

1549
02:03:36,745 --> 02:03:38,506
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've never been.

1550
02:03:38,506 --> 02:03:39,867
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just it.

1551
02:03:39,867 --> 02:03:44,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither have I. Good for you that you're getting this off your bucket list or what have you.

1552
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:45,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm jealous.

1553
02:03:45,911 --> 02:03:47,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can do it, too.

1554
02:03:47,351 --> 02:03:47,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1555
02:03:47,632 --> 02:03:48,112
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

1556
02:03:48,112 --> 02:03:49,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I can.

1557
02:03:49,353 --> 02:03:52,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I chose to do the Star Trek cruise again next year.

1558
02:03:52,154 --> 02:03:55,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have used that money to do something like this.

1559
02:03:55,216 --> 02:03:57,797
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're probably not doing it again in 2025.

1560
02:03:57,797 --> 02:03:59,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1561
02:03:59,718 --> 02:04:00,219
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1562
02:04:01,596 --> 02:04:03,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be going, my plan is to go to Tokyo Disney Sea for my 50th.

1563
02:04:22,348 --> 02:04:23,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how long are you staying?

1564
02:04:23,669 --> 02:04:27,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to go and then buy all the Duffy stuff.

1565
02:04:27,352 --> 02:04:30,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going for roughly two weeks.

1566
02:04:30,014 --> 02:04:35,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I am coming back like a couple of days early so I can get readjusted for jet lag and so forth.

1567
02:04:35,077 --> 02:04:42,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Because three days after I return, the office opens up and we have brand new people coming into the office.

1568
02:04:42,463 --> 02:04:44,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be hell.

1569
02:04:44,604 --> 02:04:45,585
[SPEAKER_02]: You have no idea.

1570
02:04:46,417 --> 02:04:47,358
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1571
02:04:47,358 --> 02:04:50,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, bon voyage.

1572
02:04:50,121 --> 02:04:53,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you have a wonderful trip and I look forward to hearing all about it.

1573
02:04:53,924 --> 02:04:54,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that why?

1574
02:04:54,365 --> 02:04:55,966
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not why you called in tonight, I bet.

1575
02:04:55,966 --> 02:04:56,687
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1576
02:04:56,687 --> 02:04:57,708
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not why I called.

1577
02:04:57,708 --> 02:04:58,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you call in tonight?

1578
02:04:58,889 --> 02:04:59,870
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't call in just to brag.

1579
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:01,392
[SPEAKER_04]: You just called to brag.

1580
02:05:01,392 --> 02:05:02,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1581
02:05:02,112 --> 02:05:04,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Which honestly, honestly, go off.

1582
02:05:04,174 --> 02:05:06,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you have every right to brag about something like that.

1583
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:06,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I would.

1584
02:05:06,717 --> 02:05:07,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1585
02:05:07,257 --> 02:05:08,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1586
02:05:08,138 --> 02:05:10,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that you've gotten the bragging out of the way, what did you really want to talk about?

1587
02:05:12,102 --> 02:05:13,963
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, love you Uk-chan.

1588
02:05:13,963 --> 02:05:28,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, I was reminded of a topic from last week about how Sony pulled all the digital videos off their service, and I understood it was because of WBD, you know, more than anything else.

1589
02:05:28,255 --> 02:05:37,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I feel the more accurate way to phrase that is that WDBD pulled their videos from Sony's service.

1590
02:05:37,383 --> 02:05:39,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a little bit, that's fine, that's fine.

1591
02:05:40,545 --> 02:05:48,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got me to thinking about how there are a lot of games that come out and we're excited for and we're like, oh, we're going to pre-order this.

1592
02:05:48,368 --> 02:05:55,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're sitting here waiting for the announcement of said game and all of the features and so forth, like what you're going to get with it.

1593
02:05:55,650 --> 02:05:58,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you find out it's just a digital only game.

1594
02:05:59,901 --> 02:06:04,803
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the games I just picked up was Yohane da Barhelion, it's a Metroidvania game.

1595
02:06:04,803 --> 02:06:12,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It was digital only here in the States, but meanwhile, while I was at Anime NYC, I was able to pick up a physical copy for PlayStation 5.

1596
02:06:12,286 --> 02:06:14,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.

1597
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:21,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And since it's like multi-regioned game, so I'm like, it didn't matter, I could play it in English and so forth, so you know.

1598
02:06:21,489 --> 02:06:21,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

1599
02:06:23,448 --> 02:06:24,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

1600
02:06:24,389 --> 02:06:27,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, I don't pre-order games anymore.

1601
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:33,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Once in a great while, I pre-ordered Final Fantasy XVI two weeks before it came out.

1602
02:06:33,095 --> 02:06:38,239
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time they're already public, and you know exactly what you're getting in that edition.

1603
02:06:38,239 --> 02:06:48,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I realized that the industry really relies on these types of pre-orders, and some would say that I should not discourage people from pre-ordering because it could harm the bottom line of the industry.

1604
02:06:49,106 --> 02:07:02,872
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I would say as the industry continues to move in this direction and by the examples that they've given us, such as what you have given you, I think it's a buyer beware situation and you should not be so quick to pre-order these things.

1605
02:07:02,872 --> 02:07:08,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I bet half those things they showed trailers for at the Game Awards, you could pre-order now if you wanted to.

1606
02:07:08,595 --> 02:07:09,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly,

1607
02:07:09,835 --> 02:07:17,600
[SPEAKER_07]: don't, because games, games don't sell out now, because at worst case scenario, you get a digital, right?

1608
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:25,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Like games, that era of I'm not going to be able to get the game I want is gone, because you could always get it digitally.

1609
02:07:25,225 --> 02:07:29,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the era of I can't get the hardware I want is still very much among us.

1610
02:07:30,442 --> 02:07:35,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I have pre-ordered so many games and I realized if I had just waited I could have saved $10, $20, $30

1611
02:07:46,212 --> 02:07:49,794
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some games, there are some special editions that I need to get my hands on.

1612
02:07:49,794 --> 02:07:55,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yes, I did drop 90 bucks on the Bayonetta 3 Special Edition.

1613
02:07:55,697 --> 02:07:58,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the few special editions where you can get it now for $60.

1614
02:07:58,198 --> 02:08:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I didn't know.

1615
02:08:00,379 --> 02:08:05,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And my backlog is so far that the game is still, the box is still sitting like right behind me.

1616
02:08:05,081 --> 02:08:09,223
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody's watching on the screen by my clothes or whatever, the box is standing, is back there.

1617
02:08:09,223 --> 02:08:13,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, if I had waited a year, I could have gotten it off of Amazon for like 80 bucks.

1618
02:08:13,745 --> 02:08:14,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Behind all the big boy shirts.

1619
02:08:16,411 --> 02:08:18,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean soon-to-be-medium boy shirts.

1620
02:08:18,932 --> 02:08:21,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1621
02:08:21,014 --> 02:08:27,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I remember y'all had mentioned, uh, like, coming up, River City Rival Showdown.

1622
02:08:27,117 --> 02:08:30,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, okay, I will pick this up for Switch.

1623
02:08:30,298 --> 02:08:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, are we getting a physical release?

1624
02:08:34,568 --> 02:08:42,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in the States, but I had to do some importing to get my hands on the limited edition copy, which was like 10 bucks more.

1625
02:08:42,294 --> 02:08:50,281
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if it wasn't, something like this, because I'm a big fan of the Kunio-kun series, I went out and I bought it.

1626
02:08:50,281 --> 02:08:51,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the Yohane game.

1627
02:08:51,702 --> 02:08:58,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have it digital, because I'm a fan of that, the Love Live series, I went out and got the PS5 version of the game.

1628
02:08:58,327 --> 02:09:00,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, sure, why not?

1629
02:09:01,676 --> 02:09:11,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel that, you know, we have all these digital games coming out, but if the sales are there, do a limited run of a physical release.

1630
02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:19,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, in a way that kind of worked for TMNT Shredder's Revenge, yes, I have, I played the digital version on Game Pass.

1631
02:09:19,521 --> 02:09:28,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I actually bought it with the DLC, and then I went out and pre-ordered the physical copy from Limited Run Games.

1632
02:09:28,764 --> 02:09:29,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Limited Run.

1633
02:09:33,214 --> 02:09:44,636
[SPEAKER_07]: as do I. Well, yeah, and I think I think especially after what happened with Warner Brothers and Sony and all that, you know, there's going to be more people that think twice about buying digital and relying on digital.

1634
02:09:44,636 --> 02:09:48,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And for me, digital really only makes sense for me in two cases.

1635
02:09:48,997 --> 02:09:52,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, PC games, because they just they don't make physical PC games anymore.

1636
02:09:52,638 --> 02:09:53,498
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't.

1637
02:09:53,498 --> 02:10:01,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Like so few PCs even come with a fucking DVD drive at this point or CD or anything like they're just there's just it's all digital at this point.

1638
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:02,381
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the last game you bought?

1639
02:10:24,738 --> 02:10:26,619
[SPEAKER_07]: The last game I bought?

1640
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:28,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a disc?

1641
02:10:28,201 --> 02:10:32,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Final Fantasy XVI.

1642
02:10:32,424 --> 02:10:33,765
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I take that back.

1643
02:10:33,765 --> 02:10:36,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Trek Online.

1644
02:10:36,907 --> 02:10:38,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XVI had a disc.

1645
02:10:38,288 --> 02:10:44,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say I've bought something since then on PlayStation, but that one comes to mind because... I meant, no, on PC.

1646
02:10:44,994 --> 02:10:45,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, on PC.

1647
02:10:45,634 --> 02:10:46,115
[SPEAKER_04]: On computer.

1648
02:10:46,975 --> 02:10:47,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fuck.

1649
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:49,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Yeah.

1650
02:10:49,297 --> 02:10:50,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably a Final Fantasy XIV expansion.

1651
02:10:50,958 --> 02:10:52,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I think mine was Star Trek Online.

1652
02:10:52,198 --> 02:10:54,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say a Final Fantasy XIV expansion.

1653
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:59,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Before they were... I think maybe Stormblood was the last one that actually had a DVD with it.

1654
02:10:59,703 --> 02:11:00,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably that.

1655
02:11:00,723 --> 02:11:03,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you the last console game that I bought was Ozmin.

1656
02:11:03,885 --> 02:11:04,186
[SPEAKER_04]: For Dan.

1657
02:11:07,233 --> 02:11:08,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you know what, Rob?

1658
02:11:08,794 --> 02:11:09,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1659
02:11:09,494 --> 02:11:11,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going towards digital.

1660
02:11:11,735 --> 02:11:14,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm old school.

1661
02:11:14,417 --> 02:11:15,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Gen Xer.

1662
02:11:15,497 --> 02:11:17,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my physical copies.

1663
02:11:17,138 --> 02:11:18,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to step away for just a moment.

1664
02:11:18,779 --> 02:11:20,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, everybody, but keep talking.

1665
02:11:21,115 --> 02:11:25,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that I'd like to have something to have.

1666
02:11:25,897 --> 02:11:26,858
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.

1667
02:11:26,858 --> 02:11:33,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if the digital is dirt cheap, then sure, I will go ahead and get the digital version.

1668
02:11:33,181 --> 02:11:38,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I can get my hands on a physical copy of it at a reasonable price, I'll absolutely do it.

1669
02:11:41,872 --> 02:11:47,398
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that, you know, you got the console, you know, you got consoles, you know, you could add extra memory to it.

1670
02:11:47,398 --> 02:11:48,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go that route.

1671
02:11:48,559 --> 02:12:01,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, I pre-ordered FF7 Rebirth, I got the collector's edition, and that same week I'm picking up my PS5 and a 2TB drive to have it all ready to go for the game when it arrives.

1672
02:12:06,755 --> 02:12:17,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the nature of things, although I honestly wish for some systems that you actually could increase their memory, and I mean RAM, and not storage.

1673
02:12:17,478 --> 02:12:22,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel that on the next generation of consoles, there should be two drives.

1674
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:28,381
[SPEAKER_02]: One drive should be just the OS drive, and the second drive is just strictly data.

1675
02:12:28,381 --> 02:12:29,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're getting there.

1676
02:12:29,301 --> 02:12:35,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so many people who are building their PCs, you have the Windows, you have the OS drive, and then you have to drive with everything else.

1677
02:12:35,223 --> 02:12:35,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1678
02:12:38,015 --> 02:12:55,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, excuse me for being a little bit of a nerd for a moment, but it's honestly one of the things that I like about the APFS format system is that if you're working in partitions, then they are dynamically resizing themselves.

1679
02:12:55,587 --> 02:13:02,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would really just need one drive that would accommodate everything and use your dynamic format.

1680
02:13:06,429 --> 02:13:09,210
[SPEAKER_02]: See, now you're gonna make me have to work, Ucchan.

1681
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:10,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making me work now.

1682
02:13:10,931 --> 02:13:12,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna write this down.

1683
02:13:12,251 --> 02:13:13,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn it off, sorry.

1684
02:13:13,731 --> 02:13:15,092
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's okay.

1685
02:13:15,092 --> 02:13:17,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

1686
02:13:17,032 --> 02:13:24,395
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the process of updating stuff at work for people getting new Macs and new Lenovo, so it's gonna be fun.

1687
02:13:24,395 --> 02:13:25,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sorry, I'm back now.

1688
02:13:25,915 --> 02:13:28,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got my eye on an M2.

1689
02:13:28,576 --> 02:13:31,337
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people that... What I was mentioning...

1690
02:13:39,215 --> 02:13:41,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I just had my weird lag.

1691
02:13:41,717 --> 02:13:42,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1692
02:13:42,197 --> 02:13:43,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, it's it's fine.

1693
02:13:43,438 --> 02:13:45,680
[SPEAKER_07]: But it creates awkward pauses.

1694
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:49,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1695
02:13:49,523 --> 02:13:53,927
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk10 says with all these stories, I think physical media will make a comeback.

1696
02:13:53,927 --> 02:14:00,372
[SPEAKER_07]: QuestBuster is talking about the last physical PC game I bought was a successful Kickstarter years ago that promised one.

1697
02:14:00,372 --> 02:14:01,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that's good.

1698
02:14:01,453 --> 02:14:05,716
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture says physical will go the route of vinyl records become a collector thing.

1699
02:14:05,716 --> 02:14:07,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what, they sell vinyl records at Target now.

1700
02:14:08,078 --> 02:14:13,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So things have an interesting way of coming full circle, that's for sure.

1701
02:14:13,601 --> 02:14:15,662
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Ranma, go ahead.

1702
02:14:15,662 --> 02:14:21,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly feel that it's that it's media is going to be the norm from here on out.

1703
02:14:22,833 --> 02:14:33,976
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing is that there are like Japan's very much into physical media, which is why you can get games like that, even though the companies that are making the games would still prefer to have a digital distribution.

1704
02:14:33,976 --> 02:14:40,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But like you still buy CDs, you still buy, you know, all of that.

1705
02:14:40,398 --> 02:14:43,579
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Ranma, is there anything else on your mind tonight before we let you go?

1706
02:14:44,813 --> 02:14:46,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Last thing and then I'm gonna get out of here.

1707
02:14:46,235 --> 02:14:47,798
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is for you, Rob.

1708
02:14:47,798 --> 02:14:53,588
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that you have brought up a few times before about how games do not come with instruction manuals anymore.

1709
02:14:53,588 --> 02:14:56,212
[SPEAKER_02]: You just get the case, the game, and that's it.

1710
02:14:56,212 --> 02:14:56,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Very rare.

1711
02:14:56,753 --> 02:14:57,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Very rare.

1712
02:14:58,214 --> 02:15:05,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I got here the Valis Collection 2 from Limited Run Games.

1713
02:15:05,741 --> 02:15:07,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Look how thick that is though.

1714
02:15:07,763 --> 02:15:09,765
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so thick, Ranma.

1715
02:15:09,765 --> 02:15:11,266
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so thick.

1716
02:15:11,266 --> 02:15:17,232
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a thick with three C's package you've got there in your hand.

1717
02:15:17,232 --> 02:15:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your mind out of the gutter.

1718
02:15:19,053 --> 02:15:20,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about a video game.

1719
02:15:25,936 --> 02:15:26,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you, Rob.

1720
02:15:26,736 --> 02:15:27,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you.

1721
02:15:27,696 --> 02:15:28,296
[SPEAKER_07]: You better.

1722
02:15:28,296 --> 02:15:29,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1723
02:15:29,757 --> 02:15:36,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So, when I got this, I always pop them open to see what all the cool swag that I have.

1724
02:15:36,098 --> 02:15:41,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I popped open the game itself, and shocker!

1725
02:15:41,619 --> 02:15:44,760
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an instruction manual in the friggin' box!

1726
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:46,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Huzzah!

1727
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:46,800
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's cute.

1728
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, I go back through my other game, like, wait.

1729
02:15:50,942 --> 02:15:57,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the first game I bought in several years where there's an actual instruction manual.

1730
02:15:57,166 --> 02:16:02,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, this is probably going to have to go in the museum and hang it right next to the castle.

1731
02:16:02,109 --> 02:16:03,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it is collector's edition.

1732
02:16:03,890 --> 02:16:04,630
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that collection?

1733
02:16:04,630 --> 02:16:07,232
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why.

1734
02:16:07,232 --> 02:16:11,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, I mean- Is that like, Valis 1 and 2?

1735
02:16:11,374 --> 02:16:20,160
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is, no, it's Cid of Valis, original 8- Alright, Cid of Valis,

1736
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:27,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Valus IV, one of the original Valus games, and Valus the Phantasm Soldier.

1737
02:16:27,343 --> 02:16:32,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a couple, I guess, 8-bit renditions.

1738
02:16:32,065 --> 02:16:32,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1739
02:16:32,646 --> 02:16:33,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I know those.

1740
02:16:33,806 --> 02:16:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1741
02:16:34,407 --> 02:16:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1742
02:16:36,027 --> 02:16:43,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to play Live in Daylight Saturday night when my local video store would have them for rental.

1743
02:16:43,111 --> 02:16:46,893
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have the first two for TurboDuo.

1744
02:16:49,244 --> 02:16:58,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That reminds me, I have to hit up Animate Japan, because a friend of mine picked up one of the Ranma 1.5 games for TurboDuo for like 800 yen.

1745
02:16:58,894 --> 02:17:00,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1746
02:17:00,476 --> 02:17:05,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Ranma, enjoy your trip to Japan, and I can't wait to hear all about it.

1747
02:17:06,550 --> 02:17:14,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if y'all end up doing a show during the midweek next week, depending on the time, Mike.

1748
02:17:14,978 --> 02:17:23,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I just stepped away because that was actually my dad that was calling, and I will stop the show when he calls because it might be an emergency.

1749
02:17:23,146 --> 02:17:25,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, it wasn't an emergency.

1750
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,028
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't realize.

1751
02:17:26,028 --> 02:17:27,830
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, your show goes on this late?

1752
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:28,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yes.

1753
02:17:28,951 --> 02:17:33,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was he was letting me know that he has Christmas Eve plans with the other part of the family.

1754
02:17:33,294 --> 02:17:35,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will be free, maybe Christmas Eve.

1755
02:17:35,335 --> 02:17:38,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have to figure out what's going on with Alan's side of the family, just to make sure.

1756
02:17:38,177 --> 02:17:44,280
[SPEAKER_07]: But if my Christmas Eve stays free during the day, then I'm totally down with it to do like a daytime show, I think would be fine.

1757
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:48,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So if not, we need to get some Panda Express.

1758
02:17:48,043 --> 02:17:51,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if nothing else, we can always do it New Year's during the day.

1759
02:17:51,785 --> 02:17:51,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So

1760
02:17:53,752 --> 02:17:54,872
[SPEAKER_07]: or New Year's Eve, whatever.

1761
02:17:54,872 --> 02:17:56,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, but we'll work that out in the coming days.

1762
02:17:56,953 --> 02:17:58,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

1763
02:17:58,933 --> 02:18:00,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Ranma, have a great time.

1764
02:18:00,153 --> 02:18:02,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, pics or it didn't happen.

1765
02:18:02,794 --> 02:18:04,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, trust me, there'll be pics and videos.

1766
02:18:04,854 --> 02:18:08,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Just understand, most of the pics will be the food that I eat.

1767
02:18:08,515 --> 02:18:09,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I love food.

1768
02:18:09,355 --> 02:18:10,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, put the food up.

1769
02:18:10,555 --> 02:18:11,135
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1770
02:18:11,135 --> 02:18:11,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, my friend.

1771
02:18:11,795 --> 02:18:12,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for calling.

1772
02:18:12,515 --> 02:18:12,915
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

1773
02:18:12,915 --> 02:18:13,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take care.

1774
02:18:13,536 --> 02:18:14,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Love y'all.

1775
02:18:14,036 --> 02:18:14,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1776
02:18:14,456 --> 02:18:15,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1777
02:18:15,596 --> 02:18:18,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Anime Jam Session, of course, Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

1778
02:18:18,917 --> 02:18:20,977
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to hear more Ranma and who wouldn't?

1779
02:18:22,011 --> 02:18:25,614
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, again, I just want to give one more plug for the email bag.

1780
02:18:25,614 --> 02:18:33,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at orangelandtrader.com is the place to send your emails, but like instruction manuals, we see them so infrequently.

1781
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:35,923
[SPEAKER_07]: But feel free to show us your thick package.

1782
02:18:35,923 --> 02:18:40,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about collector's editions of video games, of course, in our mailbag.

1783
02:18:40,106 --> 02:18:41,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at orangelandtrader.com.

1784
02:18:42,908 --> 02:18:46,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, other than that, I think we can wrap things up here tonight.

1785
02:18:46,689 --> 02:18:49,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to get everybody's final thought tonight.

1786
02:18:49,829 --> 02:18:51,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, actually wait, I should check in real quick with Loki.

1787
02:18:51,690 --> 02:18:53,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Any last minute stories?

1788
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:56,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any last minute stories.

1789
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:56,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1790
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:57,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's fine.

1791
02:18:57,290 --> 02:18:58,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we had a lot.

1792
02:18:58,131 --> 02:18:59,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We had covered a lot of news tonight.

1793
02:18:59,971 --> 02:19:01,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so we'll get final thoughts.

1794
02:19:01,431 --> 02:19:05,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, first off, thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and spending time with us tonight.

1795
02:19:05,652 --> 02:19:08,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, please help us spread the word.

1796
02:19:08,912 --> 02:19:11,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1797
02:19:12,273 --> 02:19:14,114
[SPEAKER_07]: but we need more voices to put out on air.

1798
02:19:14,114 --> 02:19:21,336
[SPEAKER_07]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or wherever goes a very long way, so we really appreciate all of that.

1799
02:19:21,336 --> 02:19:35,221
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be back in seven days to do this all over again with our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who should also be here fresh off of his on-stage events at DreamHack Atlanta, which I know is a pretty big deal, so I'm really excited to hear about how all of that went.

1800
02:19:35,221 --> 02:19:40,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll hear about that next week when VOG Network's programming starts live at 8 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Pacific.

1801
02:19:41,403 --> 02:19:43,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're gonna get final thoughts.

1802
02:19:43,245 --> 02:19:45,827
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, I know you're not streaming tonight.

1803
02:19:45,827 --> 02:19:48,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna we're gonna visit somebody else instead.

1804
02:19:48,168 --> 02:19:53,332
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you have some final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1805
02:19:53,332 --> 02:19:58,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, just remember to take care of yourself.

1806
02:19:58,176 --> 02:20:00,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't don't bite off more than you can chew.

1807
02:20:00,778 --> 02:20:05,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And be kind to people because you really don't know what they're going through.

1808
02:20:05,562 --> 02:20:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is for

1809
02:20:08,733 --> 02:20:15,657
[SPEAKER_04]: on multiple sides of opinions of world events right now.

1810
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:24,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remember, a little kindness goes a long way and helps your cause a lot better than being a shithole does.

1811
02:20:24,402 --> 02:20:25,523
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1812
02:20:25,523 --> 02:20:27,364
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, we'll go over to Techmaster Loki.

1813
02:20:27,364 --> 02:20:29,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Your final thought tonight.

1814
02:20:29,705 --> 02:20:35,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Final thought is that I gotta do some editing.

1815
02:20:35,989 --> 02:20:36,609
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1816
02:20:36,609 --> 02:20:37,650

[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it.

1821
02:20:47,974 --> 02:20:54,717
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought tonight is some really exciting stuff being planned for next year on the hosting front.

1822
02:20:54,717 --> 02:20:55,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited.

1823
02:20:55,578 --> 02:20:59,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're ever in the area, I hope you'll stop by and see a show.
