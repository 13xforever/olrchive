9907	11887	MMOs have always brought you into their world.
11887	15348	Sandbox games give you their tools to shape your own world out of their canvas.
15348	26350	Fortnite is increasingly blending the two, giving you a living world that isn't just scavenge, shoot, and survive, nor play in their sandbox, but also race and jam out when you want to, soon allowing you to pull your old plastic instruments out of their coffins.
26350	27130	R.I.P.
27130	28010	Metaverse.
28010	29731	This is the Shooty Player One headline.
29731	36992	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of this week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice,
39261	51055	hello my friends out there on the internet welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is orange lounge radio we are live once again tonight december the 17th of 2023 episode number 986 of our show
55680	61481	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here happy to be with you every single week and apologies if I sound a little off tonight.
61481	66842	It's because I am I'm getting over some type of sick that's had me up and down since about Tuesday.
66842	70323	So my voice is a little eh, so sorry about that.
70323	75564	But hopefully, here to here to help carry the weight this week.
75564	78925	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
78925	79105	Hey,
79577	85421	Hey, sorry to see your cam is broken tonight, but you are still represented with your PNG avatar.
85421	87322	But how are you doing tonight?
87322	92425	Well, actually, it's a JPEG.
92425	95006	I'm doing fine.
95006	98328	I had my ballet recital last night.
98328	100410	And I'm pretty pooped.
100410	103612	Yeah, I've done nothing but sit on my butt all day.
103612	107014	I don't think I played anything for an entire week.
107014	108815	I played some Dreamlike Valley, but like,
109338	114722	I know the feels of sitting on your butt for an entire week, but it's, it's driving me bonkers.
114722	117364	Well, I was just kind of a nervous wreck all week too.
117364	120627	And then now I like, I have no emotions.
120627	122789	I, my emotion is potato.
122789	126832	But is it nice to be, to be done with that and have that, like I did that.
126832	131196	Cause that's how I feel about some of the like hosting things that sometimes make me nervous as I get on the other side of it.
131196	132737	And I'm like, that wasn't so bad.
132737	133437	And I did that.
133437	134258	Yay.
134258	137861	But think of this, your first time hosting.
139332	141933	This was my very first recital ever.
141933	142873	Um, God.
142873	148394	And so I think my first time hosting was at the Birdcage cinemas in front of a group of like 20 people.
148394	149974	So it wasn't that intimidating.
149974	153215	But maybe like the first time hosting a big show.
153215	154555	Yeah, like yeah, nerves.
154555	156276	Yeah, for sure.
156276	163978	And then it's not just remembering what you're going to say, but making your feet and your hands do the same thing and not fall over and staying on your tiptoes.
163978	165438	With a skirt that's too long for you.
165438	165638	Yeah.
166696	181832	Yeah, that was all that was going through my head was, remember to smile, don't fall over, don't step on the dress, you know how to do a pas de bourree, you know how to do an échappé, you know how to do this, and like, why is my leg not going up in the direction I want to?
181832	182633	I don't care.
182633	183634	I did a pirouette.
183634	186236	Looking at the pictures, it looked like you did a solo number.
186236	189560	Was that a solo thing, or would the other people just kind of cropped out of the picture?
190491	194293	That's a zoom in on a picture of a couple of us.
194293	200277	Okay, but still I mean that can go because that means you have to kind of be in sync with the others and that's a whole other pressure to it.
200277	203299	So there's kind of give and take on both sides.
203299	213605	And but I feel like now that I've got that out from under me and December is apparently always the worst one for for learning routines because we had someone quit.
214364	215165	Oh, yikes.
215165	232741	And we, so we had to completely, not like a complete re-choreographing, but we had to restructure our choreography and take into account one few person for a Grand Allegro, for example, you know, not having someone be like the point of a triangle, for example.
232741	236705	And we still managed to get the routine down in a month and
237525	238385	Say hello to TechmasterLoki!
267174	277895	It's a scary, it's like a scary jump scare game where you go and collect like scrap and you have to avoid all the monsters that are trying to do different things to you.
277895	279137	So is it, is it like a...
280373	308295	like uh you know these these uh collection type of like survival build games i feel like are really in right now and like lego fortnite is just like exacerbating that whole thing is it kind of one of those type of games it's not it's not really a survival game i mean it is survival in the sense that you don't want to die but like um it's not like you're crafting things for yourself it's more of like you have to go collect loot from this procedurally generated
309665	334950	building I guess and there's monsters in there and you have to each monster has like different ways that they behave and you have to kind of navigate that way to try to like and everything's dangerous hence the name lethal company the planet's dangerous there's dangerous mobs outside there's dangerous mobs inside it's just it's it's funny in the sense of how brutal it is
337900	354853	It's fun with multiplayer because when you're talking over voice chat they give you that kind of like walkie-talkie sounding voice and stuff when you're talking to each other.
354853	356615	So there's like a filter over it.
358636	362078	Yeah, things go wrong pretty fast.
362078	363019	All right.
363019	363459	Nice.
363459	366081	Well, hopefully everything's been going right for you personally.
366081	368202	And things are going well.
368202	369663	Good.
369663	371524	Any new posts on your YouTube channel as of late?
372569	374949	No, I was editing one today.
374949	380731	I've been procrastinating this week, and by procrastinating it means I build more farms when I'm procrastinating.
380731	391853	No, I've been working on designing the ride systems for the first ride that I'm putting in my theme park, so that's taking time to design all that.
391853	396834	In the meantime, though, I've been filling out the basement area of my build with, I think, like,
397974	403155	There's at least three, two more farms in there now.
403155	405296	There was going to be three, but it didn't end up working.
405296	406556	It blew itself up.
406556	409937	But so that'll be coming in like a later video.
409937	412277	I right now have been working on the Razeworks stuff.
412277	418038	I was hoping to get it all done in one episode, but I've already got 30 minutes of just end rating.
418038	420779	So it's probably just going to be the end.
420779	422519	Then there's going to be one more episode.
422519	424560	That's the build that I did.
424560	424820	All right.
426226	430708	All right, well, we are going to get into this week's news.
430708	435590	I do want to give you all a quick schedule update before we get too far into the news.
435590	445514	We do tape live this program, of course, every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
445514	445874	But
446394	455440	That's kind of changing up for the next couple weeks because of the unique nature of this show being on a Sunday and some pretty major holidays coming up the next couple weekends.
455440	456941	We're going to do some schedule changes.
456941	463986	So next week on December 24th, which happens to be Christmas Eve, we're going to be doing an early show.
463986	466648	So and our pal Bobby Blackwolf is getting in on this too.
466648	470170	So Bobby's going to start us off next weekend at 11 a.m.
470170	471591	Pacific, 2 p.m.
471591	474113	Eastern, and we will follow that at noon Pacific,
474953	482036	3pm Eastern with a special Orange Lounge Radio episode number 987 at earlier hours.
482036	497283	If folks overseas I know it's still Christmas Eve so folks may still not be able to join us but I know some of our folks overseas in the UK this would be an excellent opportunity for y'all to jump in and listen live if you can but I understand y'all might have family obligations that come first completely respect that.
497923	502148	New Year's Eve the next week, 1231, we will not be here at all.
502148	509275	We're going to take that weekend off, and that week tends to be a very slow news week anyway, so it's not like there will be much to miss.
509275	516503	We will join you once again at our usual time, 9 Eastern, 6 Pacific, on January 7th, I think the date is.
516863	519645	when we come back from the holiday episodes.
519645	534673	So once again, next week 987 early show, then a week off the 988 when we are back on a regular schedule in early January in the year 2024 if you can believe it the 22nd year that we will be broadcasting.
534673	535554	All right.
535554	535674	Um,
536630	540591	Philof9 in chat says let's hope a new Nintendo console isn't announced then.
540591	542292	Well, not that week.
542292	546354	Now, mid-January, anything's possible there.
546354	551776	I can't remember when the Switch was announced, but I don't think it was... It was like mid-January or early February, I think.
551776	553436	I would say it was like late January, early February.
553436	558298	So it's not to say we may not have some big news towards the beginning of next year.
558718	560982	I think we want to be careful where to set our expectations.
560982	563205	I do think that comment was made very tongue in cheek anyway.
563205	569495	But since people are thinking about the Nintendo successor and all that, you know, fun stuff, you know, it's something to
570894	571854	keep an eye on.
571854	581416	But yeah, I wouldn't put any expectations until you know, maybe when we get halfway through next year, and we still haven't seen it, then we start going weird.
581416	588478	You know, because halfway through next year would be the time that this really big event in the gaming industry used to happen.
588478	590978	And they kept saying, Oh, it'll happen again someday.
590978	592598	It'll happen again someday.
592598	594899	But Loki, is that day ever going to come?
596101	599804	No, no, it's not going to come anymore.
599804	609351	So they finally decided to basically confirm what everybody's been saying for the longest time, and that is that E3 is dead.
609351	610552	It is officially dead.
610552	611973	The ESA has said it's dead.
611973	616957	It says, we know the entire industry of players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3.
616957	618418	We share that passion.
618418	621060	We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event.
621540	627246	but it's the right thing to do given new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.
627246	630689	In other words, we don't need you anymore.
630689	644322	They don't want to pay your fees to market themselves in a booth at your event and you've been irrelevant for years and now you're just, you know, yeah, I'm not, no one's surprised.
647236	648777	So, yeah.
648777	649437	Yep.
649437	660744	Um, I think maybe for this one, I am going to defer my comments here to the great Wendy Williams, who said it best in this quick five second clip.
660744	662185	Here you go.
662185	666587	She passed away.
666587	668509	All right.
668509	668949	There it is.
670211	671312	Which one was that?
671312	672533	Oh, she passed away?
672533	673995	All right.
673995	677698	Oh, I was thinking the death to all of them.
677698	680161	Well, I mean, maybe, maybe, maybe before this announcement.
680161	682463	Look, so, so here's the thing.
682463	683063	Here's the thing.
683063	694975	Like, obviously, we've known this was coming for some time, especially, especially when like, Repop, keep in mind, they partnered with Repop, never produced anything in that relationship.
695535	699497	And then Reidpop comes out and says the relationship is done with.
699497	703619	That was like, if you couldn't tell then, I don't know what to tell you.
703619	708682	And I know we were saying on the show when that was announced, well, this show is already dead, like it's not happening.
708682	710923	So this tweet is really confirming what we already know.
711343	713686	And look, I'm not trying to make E3 happen.
713686	715348	It's not going to happen much.
715348	716049	Pretty much.
716049	717170	Here's the thing.
717170	723678	I'm not exactly taking delight in the fact that E3 is never coming back because you know what, we had some damn good years at E3.
723678	726581	We had some damn good years at E3, especially, you know, like 2004, 2005.
728163	728183	E3.
748516	757223	Consumers were getting to see demos on the show floor and were not able to properly put in context that these were early builds.
757223	770753	There were way too many people that were basing their opinion of an entire game off of an E3 show demo that was maybe recorded on some, you know, game store manager's camera that, you know, was put live on YouTube and so forth.
770753	773615	That's where the show was kind of going at one point.
773615	773815	And I
775036	778559	I think, you know, because E3 kind of leaned into what the consumers wanted.
778559	781301	I don't think the exhibitors wanted that anymore.
781301	796853	And you really saw Sony kind of be the first to want to jump shark on that when E3 changed their tune the first time when they went to the airport hangar in the hotels in Long Beach in 2007, when Sony kind of threatened to quit E3 the first time.
796853	802278	But I actually think one of the ESA's big mistakes was not calling Sony on their bluff.
803191	809155	You know, Sony was throwing a fit because of how poorly the PS3 was received, but it was kind of their own damn fault.
809155	811917	Was their own damn fault, really.
811917	816720	So I think the ESA should have called them on their bluff, quite personally.
816720	823784	But they did start to let everybody into that show without really properly screening people.
823784	826546	The criteria they were using to screen people was not
827921	830022	It didn't match the times.
830022	833064	It was, do you have enough people on YouTube to get here?
833064	838108	Well, do you know that a lot of people get a lot of viewers on YouTubes by acting like dicks?
838108	841370	And I'm not saying every YouTuber acts like a dick.
841370	842831	Maybe Loki acts, no, I'm just kidding.
842831	845093	Actually, Loki does very family-friendly content.
845093	847914	But Loki, like, let's have some real talk.
847914	855539	Do you ever get frustrated at some, not all, do you ever get frustrated at some of the people who are the top Minecraft people and some of their shitty attitudes?
855539	857201	Do you ever get frustrated with that?
859122	864746	Attitudes... I mean, some people's content is certainly not for me.
864746	878074	Like, I feel there's a lot of stuff out there that... Yeah, it could be... Well, the YouTube algorithm will promote... What a lovely pageant answer.
878074	885319	Yes, there are some people out there that are considered somewhat questionable because of things that they've said or...
887040	898745	You know, they stream on Kick now, so people just assume, you know, that they're, you know, they're cool with the races, people, you know, since there's a lot of those on Kick as well.
898745	909590	But, yeah, there's, I mean, outside of even just the Minecraft space, there's a lot of people on YouTube or TikTok or whatever that are just complete
911211	913613	Wastes of human flesh.
913613	927182	I mean, so So my point is is that ESA is really the ones that put on e3 set these arbitrary goals without asking the question How did people hit these numbers?
927182	935808	So it really and it just kind of showed that The viewers were the most important thing and not necessarily the editorial content of what they were going to say
936128	941694	For example, that TryHard that keeps storming onto the stage.
941694	948702	Considering how many followers they probably have, they would probably qualify to get into E3.
948702	951785	I thought you were going to bring up the guy that took the camera in the bathroom.
955986	963468	That whole situation exacerbates exactly what I'm talking about.
963468	966308	Like, points a big neon arrow at it.
966308	972150	If somebody had ever evaluated why is this guy popular, he should have never been let in the door in the first place.
973066	977748	but the ESA was not really equipped to handle that sort of thing.
977748	981129	And I think it kind of did them in because they weren't able to evolve with the industry.
981129	989653	Well, yeah, it's hard to say like having arbitrary requirements without actually having money and research into choosing those people.
989653	992974	Also just don't let those people, you know, promote your game.
992974	999297	Cause obviously people that are like teaming up with Dr. Disrespect anyways, um, it,
1000434	1005681	He's got a persona, if you will, but you know how he acts.
1005681	1008605	And if you're willing to still promote your game with him, then that's...
1009744	1011145	You kind of invite that.
1011145	1016249	So once again, like, you know, how, how would he get invited to an event like this?
1016249	1020572	Obviously he is, he is technically an influencer for like FPS games.
1020572	1029578	There are people that agree with his opinions on that type of stuff, but he's also a bit, you know, unpredictable.
1029578	1038585	And obviously I wouldn't necessarily, you know, hitch my horse to someone that's been banned off of multiple streaming platforms, but
1041161	1045387	whatcha gonna do I guess they wanted attention that's why Paris Hilton was at an E3 event
1056072	1058473	To be fair, that was a little more on the publisher.
1058473	1060374	But let me also ask this.
1060374	1067477	Was that whole... I mean, I know it was a pain in the ass that year with the security and all that stuff, but was Paris Hilton going to E3 really the end of the world?
1067477	1070438	I don't think this big scope of things really fucking matters.
1070438	1071679	I don't think anyone cared.
1071679	1074460	Exactly.
1074460	1078282	Let them waste the money to bring her into E3.
1078282	1082904	It's ironic, though, because if Paris Hilton were to go now, I'd be like, oh, that'd be fun.
1082904	1084344	I want to go meet Paris Hilton.
1084344	1084845	She's fun.
1085885	1091892	but you know, years can change your taste and your perceptions a little bit, that's for sure.
1091892	1098259	Tigerclaw in chat says, if E3 ever comes back, it will be a name only when another company takes the name.
1098259	1105406	You know, that's an interesting thing to consider is that the ESA may have to sell the name to pay off their debts because I don't know how the ESA survives this news.
1106947	1109388	What does the ESA do for the industry other than E3?
1109388	1117631	And I'm not going to repeat the same shtick we've done on the show before where we go to their website and I show you that the things they're talking about on their website are months out of date.
1117631	1123113	And they're not doing things that are visibly beneficial for the industry.
1123113	1128455	So if they can't pivot to that sort of thing, I don't see the ESA lasting much longer than a year after this.
1131291	1135361	Philof9 in chat says, but what is the state of gaming cons anyways, would you all say?
1138308	1139509	This isn't a con, though.
1139509	1140249	It's a trade show.
1140249	1140809	That's it.
1140809	1142070	That's it.
1142070	1143850	E3 wasn't really a gaming con.
1143850	1145671	People thought it was a gaming con.
1145671	1146612	It was the trade show.
1146612	1147532	Exactly.
1147532	1151714	And I think the trade show calendar kind of just stays disrupted.
1151714	1160378	I think you have Game Developer Conference, and I think people just tend to go, you know, the actual developers and the networking part of it.
1160378	1162779	I think GDC kind of picks up the slack of that.
1162779	1165400	And then Gamescom picks up the rest of it.
1165640	1193781	and there's always there's already summer games fest was kind of replaced it anyways and people are already doing their own events around that time so it's like summer game fest they've already replaced it like several years ago summer game fest still feels a little bit like checks mix where it feels like yeah it all comes together to do this thing but it's still like you know it's a pretzel and a piece of checks like it doesn't it doesn't really feel like it has that cohesiveness yet but i feel like now it might start to glue together a little more because i think
1194521	1200667	And Bobby points out there are industry trade shows around the world, just not in the U.S.
1200667	1201088	anymore.
1201088	1214160	And I do think maybe Summer Game Fest will start to pick that up for the U.S., but I think Game Developer Conference kind of picks up a little bit more of the actual people who make the games kind of talking to each other sort of thing and networking.
1214861	1223067	And one big thing is that I don't even think that maybe like high executives at, you know, at resellers or, you know, at stores should have, you know, been permitted in.
1223067	1225029	But I don't think that anyone under a corporate level
1245262	1248824	should have been permitted to attend, honestly.
1248824	1252447	I mean, and I'm saying this as even us who went, we probably shouldn't have gone.
1252447	1255669	I'm not regretting having gone, but we probably shouldn't have gone.
1255669	1259191	We were not the intended audience, really.
1259191	1259731	You know?
1259731	1265575	Yeah, we were the ones- I mean, I was in the intended audience when I was going, you know, through my work.
1265575	1265815	So,
1267057	1268097	I don't know.
1268097	1269838	I don't agree with that.
1269838	1275120	But you personally knew how to judge what you were seeing.
1275120	1279242	And I think there were a lot of people at that level who didn't.
1279242	1290747	I think maybe what they could have done was that if they were going to allow these corporate folks to go, there should have been some type of agreement and or training that basically like, hey, if you're going as a representative of this company,
1291627	1295370	These XYZ things are okay to do and post on the internet.
1295370	1297932	These XYZ things are not okay to do and post on the internet.
1297932	1303416	And as far as I know, there was not any type of, you know, it was just open season.
1303416	1309401	The people who were intended to go probably didn't need training.
1309401	1311323	Right, right.
1311323	1314885	But there should I mean, but there still should have been something documented to that purpose.
1314885	1317908	Because obviously, we wouldn't be in this situation if it didn't.
1319025	1321369	DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1331380	1333441	But I still don't see it.
1333441	1334982	Fine.
1334982	1340966	So Bobby in chat is pointing out GDC was for the technical side, E3 was for the publishing and marketing side.
1340966	1343527	GDC doesn't want the marketers.
1343527	1345708	I don't know it.
1345708	1348390	E3, yes, was mostly the publishing and marketing.
1348390	1356234	But when you talk about like, think about how devs would still do a lot of like the post parties and hanging out and networking on that side of thing.
1356234	1358916	Like E3 was really about networking.
1359136	1360077	DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft
1389562	1398310	Anyway, um, so there you go, some, an official update on something I think most of us kind of knew was happening anyway.
1398310	1408779	But I guess, I guess it's nice that it's out there so we can all agree that yes, E3 is now dead and we can all move on and see what, and now get answers to some of these questions about like what's next.
1409608	1417473	Is Jeff Keighley and Summer Games Fest going to make a move to try to make the presence of Summer Game Fest a bigger show?
1417473	1422556	A bigger, you know, presence that happens across multiple days and so forth, but who knows?
1422556	1423977	Who knows?
1423977	1429861	All right, let's move on for now, though, and talk about what we have been doing this week, eulogizing or otherwise.
1429861	1432002	Let's go to DarkSakura and ask, how was your gaming week?
1432984	1434164	I did nothing.
1434164	1442286	I maybe played a little bit of Dreamlight Valley, but I didn't have the energy or inclination to stream.
1442286	1452349	I maybe logged into Dead by Daylight a couple of times just to get my bonuses, but I didn't do anything.
1452349	1453789	I was so frazzled.
1453789	1459611	So now that that's over, I'm gonna get back into my usual stuff.
1459611	1461111	But yeah, I didn't do anything.
1461687	1463308	Are you streaming tonight or waiting for tomorrow?
1463308	1464068	Yeah, I am.
1464068	1465209	Okay, okay.
1465209	1472692	Because I haven't done anything for the event, other than just log in and get points.
1472692	1477334	So I need to hop on that and get those, the tomes done.
1477334	1479095	Not the tome, but the challenges.
1479095	1479896	I feel really out of luck.
1479896	1483998	I haven't played DVD since, I haven't played at all since Chucky came out.
1483998	1488280	And I think maybe I played a couple things when Xenomorph was new, and that's about it.
1488280	1489520	I've just kind of been distracted.
1489520	1490941	Come play and throw snowballs with us.
1491441	1493982	I don't know about tonight, but maybe because I just need to rest.
1493982	1495323	Tonight's killer night for me anyway.
1495323	1496143	Yeah, maybe during the week.
1496143	1497364	We'll see.
1497364	1498464	All right.
1498464	1500005	Anyhow, let's move on to Techmaster Loki.
1500005	1501746	Oh, well, there is one thing.
1501746	1502966	Sure.
1502966	1512151	Um, if anyone is interested in watching some DVD, Fixie and I are going to be playing together all day on the 27th.
1512151	1513191	What day of the week is that?
1513191	1513911	So Wednesday?
1513911	1516132	That is Wednesday.
1516132	1517053	I believe.
1517053	1517833	I'll double check.
1517833	1518894	Yeah, Christmas is Monday.
1518894	1519374	So it's Wednesday.
1523349	1525951	Let's go to Techmaster Loki.
1525951	1539901	I didn't play a whole ton other than just Minecraft for the most part and building farms like I said underneath my base so that'll be probably part of whenever I film another episode of Channel 64 which hopefully will be soon.
1541187	1546051	and keep putting it off just because I wanted to get more of the theme park stuff done.
1546051	1564304	But the theme park stuff, like starting with the rides, is a little bit involved because it requires, for the details I want to put in there, it's going to require some modeling of custom objects and stuff to build some animatronics and to
1566837	1569978	build the actual game that's in the first ride.
1569978	1577901	I kind of was thinking maybe I will start with something that's not as involved, but no, that's just not the way I operate.
1577901	1591246	So I may kind of showcase part of what I've been working on like in this new episode, but just cover basically all the farms I built underneath my base, which because that's probably enough to fill an episode anyways.
1591246	1593066	It's pretty extensive.
1593066	1593586	And then
1595427	1598168	Outside of that, I've been playing a little bit more of the Playdates still.
1598168	1611673	So I played a bit of Kraken's time travel adventure, which is the story of this robot who I guess is always late for his dates because he's asleep.
1611673	1618695	And so you have to use the crank to kind of move him forward and backwards in time.
1618695	1622537	And you, based off of his movements and stuff, you have to dodge
1623777	1642418	Just pretty harmless things but if you hit any of them then you lose and you never seem to get to your girlfriend on time either so you have to still be quick so you're not too late but you're always going to be late because you wake up at the time that he's supposed to be there which is kind of weird and it gets incredibly hard so I've been trying that
1643258	1649221	I saw a little bit of Boogie Loops is the other game that unlocked this week as well.
1649221	1656365	That one's more just like a tracker, so I didn't really play with it too much because it's just making music, but it's neat.
1656365	1657685	I mean, I don't know.
1657685	1666910	I'm debating whether I want to unlock all of the games because they've got a total of 24 that I just have to, you know, go down here and, you know,
1667737	1670098	unlock them all early if I want to.
1670098	1672239	Otherwise I get two a week.
1672239	1672939	We'll see.
1672939	1674879	I may end up doing that.
1674879	1676660	Oh, there was one other one, actually.
1676660	1678501	I'm trying to think now what it was called.
1678501	1686163	It was very much like Pole Position in the sense that it's like a pseudo 3D, pseudo 3D racing game.
1686163	1689004	So it's called P-Racing.
1689004	1690025	And I'm not sure.
1690025	1693806	I guess P is polygonal because they kind of look like
1695311	1696514	Thank you for watching!
1704665	1709509	It looks like Pole Position, but it's not necessarily like that type of racing game.
1709509	1714933	Sure, you can race on tracks, but there's also more of like an open world type thing with like traffic and stuff.
1714933	1720918	So they have like missions you can do and just the actual racing as well, but it looks really good.
1720918	1722980	It's a really good looking game.
1722980	1724741	So I need to check that out.
1724741	1726262	I still can't find
1727203	1736611	Someone had said that there's a game that's like Scorched Earth on this and I have not found that and I've been looking for it because I love me some Scorched Earth, but...
1738743	1742504	Yeah, I know many golf games, so I may have to make one of those.
1742504	1747666	And certainly not anything that uses the crank to putt the ball like I was thinking.
1747666	1750027	So that might end up working out.
1750027	1753849	And looking at the catalog of games that they have, it's only four pages long.
1753849	1756950	So you don't have a whole lot of games on this platform.
1756950	1758090	That might be worth it.
1758090	1758730	We'll see.
1758730	1759231	I don't know.
1759231	1762592	Be curious to see if you decide to go anywhere with that or not.
1762592	1762792	Yeah.
1763810	1781034	um okay well my gaming week so i've played a little bit um i've been playing world of warcraft classics specifically the season of discovery because you know i talked about i think in a prior week on the show they've kind of done some different things with the early levels of the game to really change up the characters and now you know uh shamans can tank
1781454	1783436	Warlocks can tank, mages can heal.
1783436	1784817	It's some interesting things.
1784817	1785958	I've been playing a druid.
1785958	1789521	I got my druid to level 25, which is the cap in the current game.
1789521	1792304	So Miss Mu, my druid is 25.
1792304	1793945	And so I rolled my first alt.
1793945	1802413	So I have a new undead rogue named Senate Twink, who I got up to level five, I think something like that.
1802413	1806757	And of course, of course, somebody somebody in general chat because you know, you know, Warcraft players in chat.
1806977	1808818	And I was just thinking, Rob, I kind of miss my Tauren.
1827500	1832246	Warcraft Classic is kind of fun, except I don't know if you would want to subscribe, because you have to have an actor in Warcraft.
1832246	1838654	You know I don't like Classic Warcraft, I like Cataclysm Plus.
1838654	1840956	But her name, do you remember her?
1840956	1843359	Calgirl, K-A-U-G-U-R-L.
1843359	1844180	Yes, yes.
1844981	1852704	Um, I will say that Cataclysm Classic is cuz so it's literally just Warcraft Cataclysm should be out.
1852704	1855225	I want to say it's first or second quarter next year.
1855225	1857706	So that might be a hard one to resist.
1857706	1863448	So I don't know, I'm actually thinking about getting back in a normal WoW.
1863448	1869530	So, so I can play my Demon Hunter again, because I found lots of things to boundary break.
1869530	1869850	Hmm.
1870410	1877936	Because, you know, that was always my thing in WoW, was to go into the old raids and then bust out of the old raids and go exploring.
1877936	1879537	Yeah, Dragonflight's a pretty good expansion.
1879537	1881738	It's hard for me to play modern WoW.
1881738	1883160	I just feel overwhelmed now.
1883160	1884080	There's just so much.
1884080	1884461	I don't know.
1884461	1884881	It's weird.
1884881	1887383	But I did enjoy Dragonflight, playing through it.
1887383	1891186	It's a much better expansion than some of the other recent ones.
1891186	1893707	I've been interested in some of the characters they bring back for that.
1893707	1899011	So, I mean, you know, basically I started playing when my man was out of the game.
1899011	1899692	Yeah, yeah.
1900603	1901363	and NoMoreIllidan.
1926135	1927636	like and then hooray.
1927636	1934659	But yeah, so I'm hoping they do another increased XP event around the holidays too, because that's what he did during Thanksgiving.
1934659	1936620	And that was really good.
1936620	1939881	So Phila9 says no one has started playing Lego Fortnite.
1939881	1941121	I'm kind of obsessed.
1941121	1945463	Well, I've still been playing Fortnite Festival.
1945463	1946584	Little bits here and there.
1946584	1949145	I don't think Fortnite Festival is something I can play for hours and hours.
1949845	1963969	I did do a stream of it on Thursday, and what I did to make sure that I didn't get a copyright strike, because I did the same thing I do with Spotify, is that I turned off the recording of my game audio to the archive.
1963969	1972111	So unfortunately, if you go watch the archive, you're just going to hear me clacking keys to nothing, which is actually maybe kind of funny in its own way, because... Does it not have a stream remote?
1972111	1972491	The audio...
1974229	1974930	Epic Game Originals
1991741	1992381	Lego Fortnite
2007068	2009851	But I definitely see where it overlaps a little bit.
2009851	2010672	It's fun.
2010672	2014636	I you know, and the fact that it's free, I'm not going to give it money.
2014636	2014996	It's free.
2014996	2017458	It's free is is pretty neat.
2017458	2020882	I enjoy the fact that Fortnite is much more than Battle Royale now.
2020882	2028329	Like it's neat seeing these other things they can do with it, because I always thought it was interesting when they started doing these music videos and stuff in it, which was kind of the first sign of that.
2028329	2028449	So.
2030191	2031552	I'm curious to see what else they do with it.
2031552	2036655	I haven't played the racing game myself yet, but I watched some streamer friends play it, and it looked fun.
2036655	2042578	Like, it looked like a pretty well, you know, it didn't look any worse than Disney Speedstorm, quite honestly.
2042578	2045900	So, you know, for a free game, it looked fun.
2045900	2049763	So, yeah, I'm into the extra Fortnite stuff right now.
2049763	2054706	So, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I will probably be downloading Fortnite before the end of the year.
2054706	2055006	Frown.
2055606	2073820	Think of it this way, Bobby, and most people out there that are, you know, I, I'm not going to sit here and say Fortnite is without its problems, because the CEO of Epic Games, as much as I think he's made great contributions to the gaming industry, he's known to be kind of a twit on social media.
2073820	2076962	But thankfully, it's a social media platform I don't keep tabs on anymore.
2076962	2080805	So it's what I keep tabs on it, but I don't like actively read it anymore.
2080805	2081886	So whatever.
2082446	2096754	But my point is, is that when it comes to Fortnite, if you can separate in your brain Battle Royale, which is what everybody calls Fortnite, but it's really now a game mode called Battle Royale or Battle Royale Zero Build.
2096754	2111422	If you can distinguish that from Fortnite Festival, like, you know, think of Fortnite as the platform and think of Battle Royale as the game now or Festival is the game or Jam Stage is the game and any of that stuff.
2112142	2112764	Fork Knife
2120950	2124391	Forknife, yeah, there's lots of niggas.
2124391	2126992	Bobby Blackwell says, does Save the World still exist?
2126992	2128893	Yes, but not for free.
2128893	2139097	So it's because that's the that's the mode that originally Fortnite was supposed to be before Battle Royale just kind of took over the industry.
2139097	2141718	So yes, Save the World is still in there, but you have to pay for it.
2141718	2142899	So I, you know.
2143979	2144740	Are you gonna pay for it?
2144740	2145140	No.
2145140	2152366	Anyway, um, I've also still been playing a little bit of Overwatch 2 because I have a friend that really loves playing it and likes to invite me to play.
2152366	2155208	And so I've been working on my game a little bit.
2155208	2156629	I really like playing Lifeweaver.
2156629	2158211	I've gotten a lot better with him.
2158211	2160953	So he's like one of my favorite support characters right now.
2160953	2162454	I do not like Kuroko.
2162454	2165436	I do not like playing as her and I do not like playing as Brigitte.
2165436	2168179	I know she's really powerful and OP.
2168179	2169780	I don't like playing as her either.
2169780	2172102	I think my favorite support right now is Lifeweaver.
2172102	2173323	I've gotten a lot better with Ana.
2174203	2177185	Batiste, I play either Lifeweaver or Batiste.
2177185	2179066	Batiste is phenomenal.
2179066	2183068	Especially on some maps, I love being able to jump and do like his little heal bombs.
2183068	2184129	It's a lot of fun.
2184129	2189412	So yeah, I've been playing some Overwatch 2, mostly support but a little DPS as well.
2189412	2194655	I can't resist picking Widowmaker and trying to live my best sniper life.
2194655	2195555	I'm that guy.
2195555	2196696	I'll admit it.
2196696	2196816	So
2198137	2200878	MikeDef says a good Ana can turn the tides of any match.
2200878	2203378	Oh yeah, my buddy is really good at Grandma.
2203378	2204859	We don't call her Grandma.
2204859	2206179	He's really good at Grandma.
2206179	2209340	He can get like 10,000 heals in a match easy with Grandma.
2209340	2211120	And I'm like, I'm always really impressed.
2211120	2213581	So, because I can't get that high.
2213581	2214221	I've done pretty good.
2214221	2218522	I got like 7,000 with Batiste in a match not long ago.
2218522	2222203	But you know, he also has the immortality field, which is more damage mitigation.
2222203	2224384	So, but yeah, a lot of fun.
2225154	2237363	Anyway, um, let's get into some news and less about the games because yeah, I've been a little bit all over the map, but I'm hoping to catch up on a few things in my backlog this week, but we'll see.
2237363	2240685	Meanwhile, let's get into some headlines.
2240685	2243127	Phil of nine says Rob, you don't heal 500k.
2243127	2247570	I don't think that's I don't think Overwatch League players heal 500k in a season maybe.
2247570	2248831	But I don't I don't.
2248831	2249891	Yeah, in a match.
2249891	2251632	I don't think you could possibly do that much.
2251632	2252193	I'd be surprised.
2252193	2253614	Maybe you can but I'd be surprised.
2254022	2256043	All right, let's talk about some headlines.
2256043	2262845	Let's start off with this headline that they tried to sneak out at a time when we wouldn't be looking, right, Loki?
2262845	2264625	Friday evening, yeah, that's right.
2264625	2274789	So Activision Blizzard put out a statement basically saying that they've settled with the folks that are bringing up the
2277135	2278998	Gender Discrimination and Harassment Lawsuit
2289423	2299912	Yeah, so basically they've reached an agreement with the California Civil Rights Department and that's the statement that they put out.
2299912	2310101	Unfortunately, it sucks that this doesn't necessarily go to trial to get all this stuff kind of out in the open and kind of figured this is the way it was going to go since
2311970	2317653	You know, they're not going to want to drag this out into a legal battle because it's going to expose all of the wrongdoings that they've done.
2317653	2323655	But at least, I guess the victims are getting some compensation from it.
2323655	2335280	But I think they should have had to have this all come to light, because then at the very least, start cleaning up here and then set an example for other game companies.
2335280	2338422	That money should have come out of Bobby Kotick's golden parachute, but it won't.
2340236	2360713	Yeah, and thank you SSJ100 Matt with the countdown and chat reminding us 15 days left of Kotick in this industry and then Oh, and then of course, part of this as well as they're still denying the charges and you know, I don't think I think the settlement doesn't require them to admit fault if I remember correctly with some usually that's the case with these
2361353	2364355	I'm sure everyone is aware.
2364355	2371820	I'm sure everyone is aware that is 100% legal speak, because you don't pay $54 million for something you didn't do.
2371820	2383948	Or you don't know that there isn't something, you know, there to get they're avoiding a court of law for exactly what Loki is pointing out is that if it went to court, it would all come out in the public eye.
2383948	2386810	And this $54 million is to stop that from happening.
2386810	2388892	So you don't have that happening.
2388892	2390793	And on the same token say but nothing happened.
2391133	2399476	We all know that's bullshit and the only, that's all legal speak, that is only to cover themselves legally, we all know it's bullshit.
2399476	2401776	Completely.
2401776	2403977	So.
2403977	2408459	I mean, I'm, I'm glad the company's being held accountable.
2408459	2417582	What I'm not glad about is not understanding where this money's coming from because I feel like this is why then Activision turns around and is the first company to charge $70 for games.
2420512	2423534	and is Microsoft now ultimately responsible to pay this money?
2423534	2430559	I mean, I guess they know they bought damaged goods, so whatever, but do I as the gamer ultimately have to pay out this $54 million?
2430559	2440766	This should be coming out of the board, Bobby Kotick, the people that are separating for this Microsoft merger should be coming out of their parachutes, 100%.
2440766	2448252	Yeah, and I mean, you have to also look at too, you know, with the price of games being what they are now, it's like,
2449625	2455789	Yeah, they're charging more for games, but are these games coming out more polished than they were before?
2455789	2463434	No, I would say for a lot of times, we hear about games coming out with roadmaps on how they're going to fix their game.
2463434	2465035	We should never have to see that.
2465035	2467836	It should just be working when it comes out.
2468917	2495513	oh hey it's a it's a shell of what it's supposed to be it's an absolute mess and oh hey now our company has gone out of business that was something too that was uh you know earlier this week as well it's just like you you watch how these companies just mismanage this stuff and knowingly do that because i mean obviously when they put a game out and they know the state it's in there it's a gamble they're like well we'll just put it out so that we can hit our numbers but
2496093	2501835	Um, you know, the backlash won't be enough to, like, really hurt us, so we'll just... just do that.
2501835	2512938	They have the analytics to prove that, like, even though they put out trash, that people don't do anything about it, so they can keep putting out trash and keep treating people the way they are.
2512938	2514579	You know what I want for Christmas?
2514579	2517700	And you can pick whatever holiday you want, I'll pick Christmas.
2517700	2520921	You know what I want more than anything is... I want...
2521872	2522472	Phil Spencer
2548328	2549068	It won't happen.
2549068	2549889	I know it won't.
2549889	2550789	I know it won't.
2550789	2552290	But that's because you know what?
2552290	2554491	There's a lot about Christmas we're told that's a lie.
2554491	2555531	And this is another one.
2555531	2558493	But I can still want I can want it doesn't mean I'm going to get.
2558493	2559293	That's true.
2559293	2560354	Yeah, that's true.
2560354	2561874	You can want.
2561874	2573640	Just QuestBuster does want to point out this 54 million is in addition to an 18 million settlement with the US Equal Employment and 35 million with the SEC earlier this year.
2573640	2575681	Again, where is that money going to come from?
2577116	2578537	And people wonder why women are so tired.
2606403	2607323	I'm tired.
2607323	2610364	I'm tired too.
2610364	2611604	Anyway.
2611604	2613044	All right.
2613044	2629847	Let's move on and talk about Hey, some from several holiday seasons ago, you probably have accumulated a collection of plastic guitars and drum sets that are sitting in your spare bedroom or basement or garage that are collecting dust or maybe you're using them actively.
2629847	2631148	I don't know.
2631148	2633328	But for fortnight festival,
2633948	2640631	It looks like some controller support will be coming, perhaps a little sooner than you might think.
2640631	2651155	PDP is a manufacturer of officially licensed controllers, and they put a post up on social media that says, Rock on this January.
2651155	2656777	And there are emojis of a tent and a moon, which sounds like maybe Fortnite.
2657637	2658538	Festival?
2658538	2660299	Who knows.
2660299	2666805	Epic had previously stated that instrument controller support was being worked on as a priority.
2666805	2676813	Now, it sounds like this will be a new accessory, but if they can get the new accessory to work, certainly the old accessories are probably going to work as well.
2676813	2680536	And that was part of the original reporting about Fortnite Festival was that
2680976	2682937	I'm enjoying Fortnite Festival but I want to be clear
2703504	2706626	I enjoy it in small doses, little bits at a time.
2706626	2710769	I play like three songs and I'm like, okay, I had my fill for the day for a couple reasons.
2710769	2714632	One, there's only so many songs that are available for free for a particular day.
2714632	2717954	And two, I'm not going to pay 500 V-Bucks for a song.
2717954	2722137	The price of a song to add to your collection permanently is way too high.
2722137	2727261	And they're doing it because you get the song not just in festival, but you get it on the jam stage as well.
2727981	2735264	I do think it's interesting where Fortnite is bringing us to this system where you buy unlocks that work in multiple things.
2735264	2736885	I do think that's interesting.
2736885	2741587	But this whole like 500 V bucks for even for Lady Gaga, it ain't it.
2741587	2742747	It's just not worth it.
2742747	2747530	So I they're gonna have to fix that pricing system if they really want to make money off this.
2747530	2748390	I don't know maybe there's
2748550	2750271	Well, they had the like already fixed.
2750271	2752092	There's probably there's probably whales out there.
2752092	2753653	They're already buying anyway.
2753653	2762099	Yeah, they were already having to reduce the price of like some of the vehicles that they were selling, because I think they were like 5000 V-bucks or something like that for a car.
2762099	2766661	And they dropped it down to like... 4000 V-bucks for the car racing thing.
2766661	2767422	Yeah.
2767422	2767722	Yeah.
2767722	2773366	They dropped it down quite a little bit as well, because people were kind of like, what the hell?
2773366	2775107	You know, I'm not buying it for that kind of money.
2775107	2775287	Right.
2776936	2781199	and Bobby does point out in chat, Fortnite is doing it without NFTs or the blockchain.
2781199	2781219	100%.
2781219	2783020	100%.
2783020	2785162	So I do appreciate- How is that possible?
2785162	2789004	I thought it was integral to the entire Web 3.0.
2789004	2789545	I know.
2789545	2800132	So I, you know, if I may have a short list of reasons to appreciate Fortnite, but this is on that short list, is that they have essentially rendered the argument for NFTs pretty useless.
2800132	2804074	Have you seen they've been useless this entire time?
2804074	2805835	This is shocking news.
2805835	2806236	Shocking.
2807056	2812337	Alright, anyhow, let's go to DarkSakura with another big update from this week.
2812337	2815898	So Naughty Dog has cancelled a game.
2815898	2819799	It is the multiplayer version of The Last of Us.
2819799	2829041	So the project that they were calling The Last of Us Online has ceased development and they are
2832277	2843280	They put up this whole discussion on how they came to it, especially given that they've had to reduce staff, as they say they had to.
2843280	2852203	And they really wanted to make sure that it was a game that could keep people engaged for a long amount of time.
2852203	2855764	And the reassessment that they went through said that it wasn't worth it.
2855764	2858125	So that's on them.
2860171	2867333	You're going to turn all the remaining of the investment and staff into other projects.
2867333	2872175	Which is probably The Last of Us 3, but we'll see I guess.
2872175	2873815	It was almost The Last of Us.
2873815	2874015	Yes.
2876224	2878986	Yeah, I know there were people that were kind of looking forward to what this could be.
2878986	2886830	But there were also other people that were like, if they're just moving this to a games as a service type of thing, maybe maybe we're better off without this in the world.
2886830	2890792	So I sort of feel like there's people that kind of fall in either camp.
2890792	2897836	And questmaster in chat, I think with a very kind of respectful position here saying on this one, I respect Naughty Dog's decision.
2897836	2902859	Supporting a live service game is no small task and admitting that it would affect what they are good at was interesting.
2902859	2903159	Yes.
2903379	2904420	That is pretty transparent.
2904420	2907723	You don't see that type of talk from a developer very often in this industry.
2907723	2909364	So I'll give it that.
2909364	2913007	SGO100 Matt says, I'm sure elements and ideas will make its way onto a future game.
2913007	2915849	Well, they did sort of say that in their their message there.
2915849	2917330	And yeah, we'll see.
2917330	2919952	We'll see ultimately what comes of that.
2919952	2923595	Quest Buster does point out Sony's been pushing back on live service games.
2923595	2926117	They wanted to release 12 by 2026.
2926117	2928279	Now they're only aiming for six.
2928279	2928519	You know,
2929560	2933381	live service games are also they're like MMOs in a way.
2933381	2937701	You only have time for so many of them in your rotation.
2937701	2950124	Like and that was the hard lesson many people learned about MMOs is that when people invested all this time into something like World of Warcraft, it was going to take a lot for people to jump ship and play something else.
2950124	2954804	And most that the time that World of Warcraft was most vulnerable.
2954804	2957465	Do you know who did the damage to World of Warcraft?
2958902	2964546	World of Warcraft did the damage to itself with some expansions that were pretty subpar.
2964546	2969849	All the stuff that came out about Activision turned a lot of people off of Blizzard and so forth.
2969849	2970950	And rightly so.
2970950	2981737	And that's what did that MMO in and ultimately led to a ton of people leaving for Final Fantasy XIV among other MMOs, Guild Wars 2 and all the stuff that's out there.
2981737	2985580	Not to say those games didn't have people before then, but that was the biggest, you know,
2986400	2988061	Boon for everything else.
2988061	2994786	So I don't see how there's going to be room on the plate for everybody to do these games as a service game.
2994786	3000870	Quest Buster in chat says, I still wish Marvel's Avengers was more like a new X-Men Legends single player game.
3000870	3006314	There's an excellent example of a games as a service game people didn't have time for.
3006314	3008756	It was not up to a certain level of par.
3008756	3010817	People didn't have time for that.
3010817	3014420	And so now you see where it ended up.
3014420	3015841	So I just yeah.
3017475	3037801	As Joe and Matt though does point out, you know, as far as like the project getting canceled and turning into something else talks about, you know, if you want to go back to Blizzard when they were trying to make the next big MMO, which was Titan, Titan basically turned into Overwatch, you know, the pieces of Titan that they kept was what they made Overwatch out of essentially, it's making a long story very short.
3037801	3045363	But yes, so you know, maybe they're maybe they make a completely new type of game, a standalone type of game from whatever they were doing the last of us online.
3045623	3046003	Anyway, moving on.
3059139	3061760	Yep, and sometimes they end pretty suddenly.
3061760	3070985	That's the case with Ubisoft's The Crew, which came out in 2014, and now it's just been delisted without any sort of warning.
3070985	3082331	They say that its servers will shut off next year, and that's because, one, it had to do with, they quote, like, licensing and
3083972	3088456	I think the fact that it's also an almost 10-year-old game.
3088456	3103090	It says, we understand this may be disappointing for our players still enjoying the game, but it has become a necessity due to the upcoming server infrastructure and licensing constraints.
3103090	3108094	I can't imagine it would take much for them to keep the servers up, but also at the same time,
3109645	3114409	Why is there not a single player version for this game?
3114409	3122835	Funny enough, there actually is a single player component for the game that people have found while digging through the code of the game.
3122835	3128920	It's just they don't have it activated or it was never finished, but apparently it is a thing.
3130300	3131521	And that is kind of unfortunate.
3131521	3148451	That's also one of those things that you have to look at with a live service game that requires you to be connected to a server is that when their licensing agreement just stops for whatever reason, this game is essentially useless.
3148451	3151333	You cannot play it without those servers being up.
3151333	3156376	So maybe think about that before buying into a live service game.
3156857	3160360	There's also, if I'm not mistaken, there's a Crew 2 and a Crew 3, right?
3160360	3163623	So that's... Yeah, they have the Crew 2 and the Crew Motor Fest.
3163623	3167126	So they probably figure a lot of their fans are on the newer games.
3167126	3169008	Although... I understand that.
3169008	3170389	I mean, look at EverQuest.
3170389	3173472	People don't always go to EverQuest 2 just because it's a thing.
3173472	3178076	I mean, to be clear, there is a Crew 2 and a Crew 3.
3178076	3178336	Right.
3178336	3180698	But like, it shouldn't be that these games...
3181824	3183044	are essentially useless.
3183044	3187686	Like their if their argument is, well, just just just buy the new one.
3187686	3188586	But why?
3188586	3192067	You just showed me that you're going to shut this off at any given moment.
3192067	3195409	Why should I trust you with more money?
3195409	3199710	You know, for this game, like, I don't see why you would want to do that.
3199710	3205472	For me, it'd be like, you know, just get Forza Motorsports instead or something like that.
3205472	3207312	At least that game's playable offline.
3209252	3211913	I don't know, I wouldn't give Ubisoft more money.
3211913	3213153	Certainly that's not an excuse.
3213153	3221835	Well, you know, you should just... You know, it sucks that we took your game away from you, so you know how you can reward us for that?
3221835	3224796	Is by buying the next game, the newer one.
3224796	3227216	Because, you know, we're not gonna turn that off right away.
3227216	3229397	It'll be a while, and then you'll buy another one of those...
3230257	3232298	It's like, that's that's awfully nice.
3232298	3240543	That sounds so much like Konami going, hey, you know, you're banned from these tournaments, but please still spend money with our products.
3240543	3242124	You know, it's just silly.
3244648	3257038	No, I think you make another good case for why games as a service are very dangerous is that people invest this stuff into this and then, you know, here we are 10 years later, but they yanked the servers and now it's like whatever you invested into that is coming down.
3257038	3260221	There's no way to kind of save that and have that offline.
3260221	3262282	Very, very, very few games do that.
3262282	3268247	I remember like Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst kind of embraced that and set a model for what it ought to be.
3268247	3270449	But unfortunately, it very rarely ever is.
3270649	3277913	And surely like they do market this game sort of as a MMO style game.
3277913	3280054	So there's that component of that.
3280054	3283595	However, they also market it as a single player game.
3283595	3288898	So typically, when you think of a single player game, you don't think of online only single player game.
3288898	3293440	So that that's where I think that the advertisement of this game is a little
3295185	3302831	confusing on purpose, you know, so that people buy into it and then they don't realize, oh, this is basically like an MMO.
3302831	3304933	So when it's done, it's done.
3304933	3313800	Funny, because if this was 10 years ago, this would have been about the same time Diablo 3 came out and got a lot of shit for that same thing where it was always online and they ended up having.
3313800	3321226	So when the console releases for that came out, you may remember it pulled the always online component to do the console releases.
3321226	3321807	Right.
3321807	3322908	And that's what they should have.
3322908	3323088	Yeah.
3323288	3339346	That's what they should have been working on with this and I get it like oh that will cost you some money and you may not necessarily recoup that money that you put into it but like being that they obviously knew when their licensing period was like they should have in the the
3341519	3344020	to help promote game preservation.
3344020	3350442	They should have at least fleshed out their offline mode that they clearly have built into the game.
3350442	3359905	Like, there are screenshots showing people manipulated the game to re-add that back in there, where you can see, press X to play offline.
3359905	3366148	So, if that component was built in there, or it needed to be built in there, I think that they should have patched that.
3366148	3367988	Say, hey, servers are going down, but you know what?
3367988	3369209	You can enjoy this offline now.
3370741	3377726	But they're not doing that because why should they put money into something when they can try to get you to buy the newer product instead?
3377726	3381089	And it's unfortunate that they just don't care about you as a customer.
3381089	3385993	They're just like, well, we'd prefer you just bought our newer game instead.
3385993	3387214	Purchase more things with us.
3389400	3398708	All right, well, let's move on and talk about some interesting stuff that happened on twitch.television this week, which is the site where we do our shows.
3398708	3400209	So this is interesting.
3400209	3408336	There was a policy update that happened a few days ago, about the sexual content policy, and there's a whole blog post that came with it.
3408656	3416459	talking about, oh, we get feedback from streamers that our current policies around sexual content are confusing, it can be difficult to know, da-da-da.
3416459	3431444	And they said, we believe that accurate content labeling is key to helping viewers get the experience they expect, and now that we can enable appropriate labeling of sexual content using CCLs, we believe that some of the restrictions in our former policies are no longer required.
3431444	3437706	So, the updated policies meant that some previously prohibited content was now allowed.
3438326	3442228	if the correct CCL content classification levels are used.
3442228	3459394	This would include content that deliberately highlighted breasts, buttocks, or pelvic region even when fully clothed, fictionalized nudity, body writing, and erotic dances involving disrobing or disrobing gestures.
3459394	3465716	Popular dances like twerking, grinding, and pole dancing were now allowed without a content label.
3465716	3467217	Well, guess what happened?
3469746	3470727	I know what happened.
3470727	3471967	They fucked it up for everyone.
3488153	3491655	caused confusion and appreciate all the feedback we've received.
3491655	3496457	Thanks for always coming together with us to build the best version of Twitch.
3496457	3501199	And yeah, upon reflection, we decided we went too far with this change.
3501199	3507101	The platform has admitted there's been difficulty with individual depictions of nudity because of AI.
3507101	3517086	So effective today, we are rolling back the artistic nudity changes and moving forward, depictions of real or fictional nudity won't be allowed on Twitch regardless of the medium.
3519364	3523966	I mean, guys can go without their shirt.
3523966	3525126	Not on Twitch, they can't.
3525126	3525646	No, they can.
3525646	3526766	Yeah, they can now.
3526766	3528367	That policy changed a long time ago.
3528367	3538029	And trust me, there's streamers out there where it's like half the stream is the shirtless guy and then like behind them is whatever game they're playing.
3538029	3546131	And there's some women that still play like, yeah, they're wearing a top, but it's cut in a very strategic place that are doing the exact same thing.
3547023	3549985	But they still can't remove it and be topless.
3549985	3551726	No, they can't remove it and be topless.
3551726	3562494	So again, yeah, it's it's a big double standard and especially just goes to show how, you know.
3562494	3571320	Anally clenched our society is about nudity, where we can have violence all day and all night and no one gives a shit.
3571320	3572921	Mm hmm.
3572921	3573822	Because Murica.
3574764	3588194	Well, and always also remember at the end of the day, people are going to watch like the things that are popular are because you watched it, you know, you meaning the collective audience of the internet are watching these these types of things.
3588194	3596100	So it's, you know, if you aren't a fan of these streamers that are really the focus is on themselves, and not the game that they're playing.
3596100	3599482	That's really what it comes down to is the focus on themselves, not the game that they're playing.
3599482	3600023	Don't watch them.
3600823	3616514	It's well it's right in the line and it really I mean I agree about the whole violence thing too like that should be if it's incredibly violent gameplay or footage that you're seeing that should also be kind of gated off separately as well.
3616514	3627882	The main problem originally was that this stuff was being promoted on the front page like these streams so like you hop in like you don't even have to be signed in to Twitch and it's just like
3629190	3633851	It's softcore pornography, basically, on the front page.
3633851	3641053	And I get it, the double standard that's in there, but you also have to understand, they don't really care what the users think.
3641053	3642614	That's not at all.
3642614	3644254	You know what happened with this?
3644254	3654837	It's because the credit card processors probably came down on them, or the ad providers came down on them after this just went free-for-all for less than 24 hours.
3654837	3656658	They saw what it looked like, and it's still
3657458	3681558	pretty much like that like the certain metas that are out there are still there and you know clearly it is for a specific reason they're trying to skirt that line to you know do that and that's fine if they want to make that type of content a thing that they have on their site it should be separated off from the rest of the content like it shouldn't be considered
3682259	3695728	just chatting or gaming it's certainly not gaming at that point but like it should be separated off so you can have your own channel where that type of content exists and then age gated if you will um
3697285	3697485	DarkSakura
3715720	3719442	I think that's the problem is where are they going to draw the line fairly?
3719442	3733988	Because I think when this was put into place, then it was causing people that, you know, were playing mature rated games or whatever to, you know, fall off the front page and that type of stuff where they kind of felt like that wasn't fair because maybe the game isn't rated appropriately or whatever.
3733988	3735349	Like, where do you draw the line?
3735349	3737690	You're asking, then Twitch becomes the morality police.
3737690	3738070	What do we do?
3738530	3740371	Well, yeah, certainly.
3740371	3747755	And you know, you're always going to have people there and try to skirt the rules to push whatever they want.
3747755	3750437	They have a problem with content moderation.
3750437	3756040	And unfortunately, that takes people to do that or algorithms, I guess.
3756040	3759462	But it's just.
3759462	3761403	Yeah, it's going to be a problem.
3761403	3763865	And even when they, you know, have these
3765114	3787139	rules in place like assuming that they kept them like people that are streaming that may be just large chested not necessarily trying to like accentuate that as part of like their persona online you're not trying to use that to like it's just that's just who they are and they're just wearing comfortable clothing you know there's a difference between you know
3787699	3804472	Someone wearing comfortable clothing and just gaming and just hamming it up with their audience and somebody that is cutting their camera just below, so it looks like they're topless, whether they are or not, you know, just to skirt by the rules because it says, well, you can't show any of this.
3804472	3810097	So we're just going to cut that part, just going to be right below the camera, you know, and then.
3811938	3814560	It's at that point, it's like, what is this?
3814560	3818123	Like, you know what your like target demographic is here.
3818123	3825669	You're obviously trying to, you know, bait with sexual content to try to get people to donate for different things.
3825669	3828511	And that that doesn't belong in the site, in my opinion.
3828511	3833035	It belongs on another type of site that that caters to.
3833035	3839400	You know, there is a live there is a live streaming site that full on allows nudity.
3839400	3839800	Exactly.
3839940	3842441	because I've seen it linked to on blue sky.
3842441	3845363	I think I think it was called joystick.
3845363	3847304	I could be wrong.
3847304	3849946	But somebody somebody was advertising.
3849946	3852708	So this is how I found out is I was on a random feed.
3852708	3854789	I was on like the gamer feed or somebody and somebody was like,
3855149	3857791	Hey, I'm going live and I'm playing such and such a game on my feed right now.
3857791	3858271	Check it out.
3858271	3858992	And they linked to it.
3858992	3860533	And I thought, I think the site was called joystick.
3860533	3862614	And I was like, I've never heard of this site.
3862614	3863695	Is there a new like streamer?
3863695	3868058	And I went to their, I went to the stream and they were playing the game.
3868058	3869238	All right.
3869238	3871760	And not wearing any clothes.
3871760	3876503	And I was like, Oh, it's that kind of site.
3876503	3878985	I honestly, I was like, I'm surprised I hadn't heard of it before.
3879725	3899115	But on top of that too, I mean, we're also dealing with societal conditioning, you know, if it hadn't been that, you know, certain reproductive elements of human anatomy were considered also to be naughty, then, you know, people wouldn't have a stick up their ass about it.
3899115	3901957	But that's society.
3901957	3902257	Anyway.
3904182	3905383	Uh, all right.
3905383	3907805	So I, yeah, I'm not jealous of Twitch.
3907805	3910026	These are very difficult waters to navigate.
3910026	3913929	And if you give people an inch, they're going to take a mile.
3913929	3917051	And essentially, they're having to play the morality police a little bit.
3917051	3920173	Yeah, it wouldn't be a problem if they were one.
3922342	3939433	They enforce the rules evenly is the main problem because you have you have folks that have straight up film pornographic content live on Twitch and got a temporary suspension on their channel and they just came right back.
3939433	3942115	But it's like, but somebody who might
3943143	3951891	just tangentially have their OF as a link on the sidebar because that is also something they get into.
3951891	3953652	They should not be penalized for that.
3953652	3954813	You know, I understand.
3954813	3956735	You can't make that the focus of your stream.
3956735	3961739	But if that is just, hey, here's one other place you can find me and give me money if you like.
3961739	3970847	If that is where somebody chooses to monetize, that should not be penalized and somebody should not be withheld from the front page because they they tangentially have another side business.
3972287	3977529	Well, at least now they're, you know, not so sticky on cross streaming.
3977529	3987293	But for a while, though, I think that had a little bit more to do with competition, with advertising a competition.
3987293	3987914	Oh, yeah.
3987914	3990315	And a little bit less than the nature of Blink.
3992833	3994654	plus so many people were doing it anyway.
3994654	3996856	And it's a hard thing to play, especially on the affiliate level.
3996856	3999037	There's so many people that were just doing it anyway.
3999037	4006562	You can't get away with it a lot with TikTok because their biggest competitor really that they were worried about was YouTube.
4006562	4010245	If we all run an area 52 at once, they can't get us all.
4010245	4013467	All right.
4013467	4014688	Remember when that was the thing?
4014688	4014928	All right.
4014928	4016549	Anyway, let's move on.
4016549	4018691	Something a little more lighthearted, please.
4018691	4019131	DarkSakura.
4020922	4024703	So, um, excuse me.
4024703	4026423	SEGA.
4026423	4033125	They have trademarked a number of classic franchises.
4033125	4036746	I mean, their own classic franchises.
4036746	4046088	But they have trademarks as of December 6th for Altered Beast, Eternal Champions, Jet Set Radio, and Kid Chameleon.
4047188	4059696	So, I mean, we knew that they were doing a Jet Set Radio with Crazy Taxi and Golden Axe and Streets of Rage and Shinobi, but now we have a couple more, so... Who knows what's gonna happen?
4059696	4065099	Or maybe they're just kind of bookmarking it for future use if these other games do well.
4065099	4067341	They have places to grow into, you know?
4067341	4070142	Could be that kind of thing, yeah.
4070142	4071083	I still think it's interesting.
4071775	4072776	I want a game in that universe.
4086867	4089288	TigerClaw in chat says a new Altered Beast would be nice.
4089288	4092429	I wonder how they would approach it if it plays like the original but in 3D.
4092429	4093189	Why?
4093189	4094009	It could still be in 2D.
4094009	4100531	There's a lot, like look at, I know you love your Ninja Turtles, TigerClaw, so why not like a Shredder's Revenge?
4100531	4102052	Altered Beast could come back like that.
4102052	4109255	Like the, just take what was great about the, you know, when everybody loved the Ninja Turtles game, like the arcade game, right?
4109255	4113096	Make a game that really like kind of celebrates that and focuses on that.
4113436	4116337	but just kicks it up to, you know, the current year.
4116337	4117278	That would be awesome.
4117278	4119059	I'd love an alternate beast in that kind of.
4119059	4121180	Do you remember the Sega Ages 2500 series?
4121180	4123501	I have a couple of those things.
4123501	4123861	Yeah.
4123861	4127683	That's what I would like to see something like where it's just zhuzhed up a bit.
4127683	4128463	Yeah.
4128463	4131764	And I think the Sega collection on 3DS, was that the same collection?
4131764	4134045	Because those games were so good.
4134045	4134626	I don't remember.
4134626	4135266	I think so.
4135266	4136387	Yeah, they did like some.
4136387	4139588	Yeah, they were Sega Ages on 3DS or whatever it was.
4139588	4140648	It was really good.
4140648	4141529	So I just love to see that.
4143167	4147853	I mean, you played that version of Fantasy Zone I have.
4147853	4148834	And it was really good.
4148834	4150556	And it was just good old Fantasy Zone.
4150556	4151417	That's right.
4151417	4154421	Yeah, sometimes it's fun to just zhuzh up the classics.
4154421	4159747	I actually, speaking of 3DS, I loved the version of Kid Icarus they did on 3DS.
4161008	4167835	Um, and they just it was very similar to the eight bit version, but it supported the different screen ratio.
4167835	4182488	And it just like all the 3d effects were, were like the different layers on different, like, z axis, basically, like, you know, like things in the background where the bar and it was it worked, it was very effective.
4182488	4182869	I loved it.
4186778	4191040	I wish Nintendo did this with their classics so much more.
4191040	4193180	I think all of us do.
4193180	4202603	It's almost criminal how much Nintendo abandons their old classic library, but it's a topic for another day I guess.
4202603	4204844	Anyway, back to the modern stuff.
4206829	4219712	All right, well, I guess this was bound to happen sooner or later, but A24 has announced that they're going to be doing a Death Stranding movie.
4219712	4221853	I'm not surprised it's them.
4221853	4229295	Yeah, it's Kojima Productions said that the movie won't just be a direct translation of the game.
4229295	4231055	Well, there wouldn't be enough time.
4231055	4233356	The opening is as long as a fucking movie.
4234988	4245038	um yeah so uh the only way i saw this is that they were selling an A24 Death Stranding shirt on i think
4246155	4251459	It was on A24's website is actually how I saw that this was a thing.
4251459	4258384	Yeah, I'm curious to see more about it when it comes out and hopefully it makes sense because I mean, I didn't understand.
4258384	4265630	A24 has a lot of credibility and rightfully so, like they put out some really fucking interesting movies.
4265630	4270593	So just that partnership alone is got a lot of people excited, that's for sure.
4271955	4276280	Tigerclaw says, I wonder if they can get the same actors from the game for the movie.
4276280	4282627	Well, if they're trying to make something different, though, a great place to start might be casting different people.
4283544	4287347	because otherwise, otherwise, people are always going to make that connection.
4287347	4288548	Norman Reedus.
4288548	4294071	I think a good gag would be focus on different people in the movie.
4294071	4298755	And then maybe Norman Reedus shows up at the end type of thing, you know, like tie it that way.
4298755	4303018	But maybe put the focus on, you know, I'm sure there's lots of stories to tell within that world.
4303018	4304319	Maybe put the focus somewhere else.
4304319	4304659	I don't know.
4304659	4305219	Just a thought.
4305219	4305760	Just a thought.
4305760	4308001	There's there's a lot of things they could do with it.
4308001	4312084	I'm going to try to trust the process and hope it turns out OK.
4312084	4313105	Yeah, it'll be exciting.
4313430	4323859	So, but if Hideo Kojima is actually creatively involved with it, won't they have to split it into like three movies?
4323859	4329343	It'll be a TV series where every episode is two hours long and there's like 24 episodes.
4329343	4329684	Exactly.
4332034	4333175	All right.
4333175	4341465	Well, on a very sad note, especially for this time of year, I'm really sad to continue to report layoff stories.
4341465	4348093	Unfortunately, layoffs are still hitting the industry, even during the holiday season in December.
4348093	4349034	3D Realms
4350976	4353578	was hit with Embracer layoffs.
4353578	4356981	3D Realms, of course, you know, they've made games.
4356981	4358862	They go all the way back to like Duke Nukem, right?
4358862	4367488	But a little more recently, the Kinderman Remedy, Kingpin Reloaded, and Ion Fury Aftershock was one that had a bit of traction there.
4367488	4369250	But half the company has been laid off.
4370010	4376773	Embracer Group acquired 3D Realms in 2021, only to lay off half the studio this past week.
4388749	4404386	On a similar note, the studio behind TimeSplitters' Free Radical Design also closed their doors last week, another hit within the Embracer group.
4404386	4408491	You might remember though, in this case, the original iteration of Free Radical fired from
4408971	4416716	excuse me, filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and it came back as Crytek UK and Dambuster Studios.
4416716	4428504	And then in 2021, Embracer Group came in, rounded up the key staff that was around from the Free Radical Days to work on reviving TimeSplitters, but none of that matters now.
4428504	4434668	If you actually go to freeradicaldesign.co.uk, you will get a
4435248	4436489	Oh, this is so sad.
4436489	4438090	I'm gonna actually show this on the other screen.
4438090	4439692	I don't know how well this will translate over.
4439692	4446858	But you actually get a message that comes up on the website that says 404 company not found.
4446858	4447358	Frown emoji.
4447358	4449420	That's horrible.
4449420	4450981	That hits me right in the fields.
4450981	4452462	That's terrible.
4452462	4454764	It is terrible, but clever.
4454764	4457326	Yeah, props to the person that did that on their way out.
4457326	4462651	Like, yeah, I will say that whoever found the time to do it like and like did that on their way out.
4463868	4485289	props to you because that's ow ow right in the feels good all right honestly it's a nice little f you a little bit yeah it's I don't know if I would say f you or yeah I guess I guess it is f you it's just it's also like hello depression anyway
4486437	4494171	All right, let's let's try to lighten up the mood a little bit with a segment here that always takes a look back at when things maybe were a little more fonder in our industry.
4504818	4512569	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4512569	4515954	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4515954	4518298	Alright DarkSakura, what did you pick this week?
4519611	4529119	I picked FireShark, and I have done its predecessor, which was FlyingShark, that we also got on NES's SkyShark.
4529119	4530961	But I love FireShark.
4530961	4533623	I love both of those games, to be perfectly honest.
4533623	4534964	I mean, they're freaking Toaplan.
4534964	4537846	I was like, you love Toaplan.
4537846	4539868	I like to say Toaplan.
4539868	4541870	It's just fun to say Toaplan.
4541870	4542570	All right.
4542570	4545613	I need to step away for just a moment to hydrate, but I will turn it back over to you.
4546590	4564461	Okay, so at any rate, Fire Shark is a vertically scrolling shooter that came out, it was published by Toaplan in Japan in 1989 and then also by them in Europe and by Romstar in North America.
4564461	4567563	As I said, it's the sequel to Flying Shark, aka Sky Shark.
4569004	4573126	And it's a pretty awesome game.
4573126	4582151	It's set in 1991, where there is a mysterious armada launching a worldwide attack from the Mediterranean.
4582151	4585193	And so you fly a biplane in 1991.
4589110	4602742	At any rate, it was an in-house port to the Mega Drive slash Genesis and published worldwide by DreamWorks, Toaplan, and Sega between 1990 and 1991.
4602742	4605004	There were a few changes on the console release.
4605004	4612691	There's also a conversion for the Sharp X68000 that never did get released.
4612691	4614572	It was, I mean, it was just like...
4617375	4621961	pretty well in the west, but not as much in Japan because it was pretty hard.
4632039	4634560	It's, of course, you know, kind of like a military theme.
4634560	4642044	It has a, you know, very reminiscent of the 1940 series of games.
4642044	4651990	You have to fight, like, tanks and kamikaze planes and artillery and ships and other crap.
4653059	4655681	from the Strange Fleet Armada.
4655681	4662026	And you've got different weapons that you can get as icons as you destroy these zeppelins.
4662026	4665468	A laser beam, a wide shot, or a flamethrower.
4665468	4671432	You also get speed boosts, you get extra bombs, you get P and 1-ups.
4671432	4677696	If you get three P's in a row, then it increases your firepower one level.
4677696	4679218	Of course, the third being the highest.
4680018	4684804	and then you just like fill the entire screen with just bleh.
4684804	4685905	That's how I'm going to describe it.
4685905	4688508	Just just you're pissing fire all over the screen.
4690694	4699098	Anyway, you have, depending on your settings for the arcade version, you also can use a checkpoint.
4699098	4705701	So if you're downed and you have to start over, you respawn from your checkpoint.
4705701	4710003	Of course, if you get hit by an enemy, you lose life and can decrease your firepower.
4710763	4715490	And then in the arcade, you can put more money in to keep on playing!
4715490	4721338	It has 10 stages, and it loops back to the first one after you have completed the last stage.
4721338	4723201	It's a very tour plan thing.
4723201	4726666	However, it gets a lot more, uh, bloody.
4728517	4757111	Um, one thing that was pretty cool about this game, and I think it's just one of the things that makes the game look really, really nice, is that, um, the artwork, a lot of the artwork in the game was hand-drawn, um, and then, uh, transposed-to-pixel art, um, it just, it gave it a really good, really good, uh, um, you know, look to the game, and they,
4758551	4780545	They wanted this to also sort of serve as a successor Like there's a there's like different weapons that this one is successor to weapons from other games like the blue laser from Truxton You know the the flamethrower is of course new But they wanted things
4781425	4785828	They wanted to sort of keep it in the family of games.
4785828	4794874	And they were settling on the word, which I'm guessing would be same and not same.
4794874	4798737	You know, they were saying they wanted to put out the same strengths.
4798737	4803700	The word same would be shark in Japanese.
4803700	4808103	So they wanted to keep the shark name anyway.
4808103	4808944	Yeah, language is fun.
4810003	4817070	Anyway, it was released by Toaplan in Japan on November 2nd, 1989, and then in Europe, uh, the same year.
4817070	4823856	North American release was by RomStar, uh, March, uh, 1990.
4823856	4832545	And then, um, there was an album of the music, and the music was done, uh, by, uh, excuse me, um,
4833991	4841412	by Yuge Masahiro, and the art was done by Nako Gashintaro.
4841412	4843433	Just really beautiful stuff.
4843433	4846253	The music in this game is great, very just energetic.
4846253	4855155	So there is a full, an album that was released by Skytron and Pony Canyon.
4855155	4860576	And then, of course, October 1990, Toaplan released Fire Shark.
4862780	4867306	and it was released in North America by DreamWorks as a division of Toy Soldiers.
4870252	4873314	It really, it was very faithful to the original.
4873314	4881540	It did have harder difficulty settings, but it did have a smaller color palette, so they had to redo some of the sprites.
4881540	4891267	And as I said, there was an x68000 version in development that was supposed to be published by Kaneko.
4891267	4896631	And they did advertise it pretty heavily, but it didn't get released to market.
4898897	4917643	The port was re-released later by Retro-Brit in 2020, and in 2022, the arcade version was included in the Hisho Same Same Same compilation for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as M2's Toaplan Arcade Garage.
4917643	4922645	The original was also included in the Sega Astro City Mini-V,
4924723	4935689	And yeah, but as far as its ratings when it was released, it got really high ratings.
4935689	4939491	Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40.
4939491	4944814	Computer and Video Games gave it 90% for the Mega Drive.
4944814	4947715	EGM for the Mega Drive gave it a 33 out of 40.
4947715	4952078	So I mean, it got some pretty, pretty good reviews.
4954800	4963791	There's a German magazine called Power Plague that compared it with 1943, the Battle of Midway and Vapor Trail hyper-offense formation, which are pretty apt reviews.
4963791	4970138	I mean, the whole military theme and having like all kinds of special weapons that shouldn't have existed in that environment.
4971119	4991359	So, um, but yeah, as far as, um, other things, uh, the rights to FireShark and the other Toaplan IPs are owned by a company called Tatsujin, which is, uh, it was named after Trexton's Japanese title, uh, Tatsujin.
4992260	4996964	And it was founded in 2017 by Yuge.
4996964	5004291	And they're affiliated with an arcade manufacturer, XA Arcadia.
5004291	5014920	And in other influences, SuperXYX, it was influenced stylistically by Fireshark.
5014920	5016081	So there you go.
5017307	5023293	Alright, I actually didn't know a lot about this game so it looks like a lot of fun though.
5023293	5026977	They have it every so often at California Extreme.
5026977	5033123	It was there a couple years ago and I think I just like didn't get off of it because I was like there's fire everywhere.
5033123	5035185	The flamethrower weapon was clearly my favorite.
5035325	5044830	Yeah, no, and I agree with what Questposter said in chat about, I love the art direction for games like this that pair terrifying flame cannons that reach across the screen to a tiny biplane.
5044830	5051774	Oh yeah, there's just something about this era of shooter games that is excessive and wonderful.
5051774	5056177	Just freaking tattoo the Toaplan logo on my butt or something.
5056177	5058578	Careful what you ask for.
5058578	5060399	Well, no, because no one's going to pay for you to do that.
5060399	5062440	I know an artist that could do it.
5062440	5063721	No one's going to pay for me to do that.
5065586	5066567	I'm not going to pay for it.
5066567	5069388	It is the holidays.
5069388	5070208	I have other things.
5070208	5072789	Is that a dare?
5072789	5075571	I'm not going to have the Toaplan logo tattooed on my butt.
5075571	5077412	I'll have something else tattooed on my butt.
5077412	5078472	All right.
5078472	5080953	A butt tattooed on your butt?
5080953	5082194	A butt-shaped tattoo.
5082194	5082834	All right.
5082834	5083635	Anyway.
5083635	5085175	With a butt on it.
5085175	5087777	I'm back and I'm- It's butt-ception.
5087777	5090198	And yes, I get the Beavis and Butthead reference.
5090962	5097024	I'm back and I'm hydrated and it's this actually does relate to the show because I'm drinking a particular beverage.
5097024	5099925	I'm not going to say the name because they're not sponsoring us.
5099925	5109949	So I'm not going to say their name on the podcast, but it's a beverage that I drink and I can't not think of DarkSakura when I drink this beverage because it's the P word.
5109949	5110809	Yes.
5110809	5116011	Yeah, because it's it's something that we used to drink when we played DDR all the time.
5116871	5118472	I can't stand those drinks anymore.
5118472	5119392	They taste slimy.
5119392	5120072	They feel slimy.
5138399	5149962	Recently I've just been all about water when I'm dancing, but in the morning when I make my coffee, I use potassium drops and echinacea drops.
5149962	5155584	Yeah, it's like, I don't want to get sick, but I don't want my water to taste like salt.
5157549	5160570	I don't even like Pocari Sweat anymore, but Dan drinks that up.
5160570	5161390	Oh, interesting.
5161390	5167091	No, I mean, like, I'll drink regular tap water, but I get, I, yeah, I get bored of it.
5167091	5177293	So I, I like to use, I still use the little, like, infuse, again, I'm not naming names, but I use little infusers that you put a little bit in it and it just adds a little bit of... I'll name a name.
5177293	5179313	I still drink that, that Mio stuff.
5179313	5181534	Well, Target has like a generic brand of that.
5181534	5182354	So I'll use that.
5182354	5183394	Yeah.
5183394	5187015	I'll drink whatever people want to send me free samples of too.
5188208	5193630	Like, I have so many different samples of sports drinks that I got at TwitchCon.
5193630	5197391	Careful what you wish for, because I think the mailbag has yet another email contact.
5197391	5198012	I deleted all that.
5198012	5198312	Okay.
5198312	5200172	I was like, I think somebody's desperate.
5200172	5206375	But I mean, literally if someone does want to sponsor me, I'll be like, yeah, your drink's adequate.
5206375	5210756	Oh shit, what a rousing advertisement.
5210756	5214698	Well, it clearly worked because I have to pee.
5214698	5215798	Let me run an ad break.
5216604	5219125	Don't run an ad break now or you might miss some rapid fire news!
5247338	5250760	Yes, is called Friday the 13th Jason's Doom.
5250760	5257364	It is a total conversion or I guess map pack whatever for I'm sorry, I have to derail for a minute.
5257364	5258904	The game that's playing in the background there.
5258904	5261886	Is that person wielding a stop sign as a weapon?
5261886	5262446	Yes, they are.
5262446	5264107	Tell me more about this.
5264107	5266329	I'm down for that.
5266329	5270491	So it looked like they were wielding a stop sign and then they put it down and then they picked it up again.
5271568	5278132	So, okay, so right here in this part is where you have to pay the monster.
5278132	5279073	You don't really see it.
5279073	5281454	You pay them to get money.
5281454	5283375	You have a quota you have to meet.
5283375	5286097	And so if you hit the bell, there's like a little service bell there.
5286097	5289999	If you hit it too many times, the tentacles come and kill you.
5289999	5294822	But you basically put the stuff you're trying to sell on the counter there, and then you hit the bell.
5295905	5296405	Interesting.
5296405	5302229	Not too many times because otherwise you will die because it is lethal company.
5302229	5303310	Interesting.
5303310	5306072	I just like the idea of beating people up with a stop sign.
5306072	5307573	Stop!
5307573	5308994	Stop!
5308994	5310695	There's monsters in the game.
5310695	5311735	Like there's all sorts of things.
5311735	5313877	There's like spider-headed things.
5313877	5315178	All right.
5315178	5318139	It sounds like one of the streamers, DarkSakuraWatches, plays it.
5318139	5319841	So I need to check it out, I guess.
5319841	5321061	Yeah, you need to check it out for sure.
5321061	5321822	It's a good time.
5322542	5328685	Alright, anyway, sorry, back to Doom meets Friday the 13th because I was interested in that too until I got distracted.
5328685	5336427	Yeah, so it is still a work in progress, but you can check out the current progress on it already.
5336427	5340189	I think you can download it still and be able to play it.
5340189	5345191	And yeah, it is essentially the Friday the 13th NES version.
5346499	5350642	Fully fleshed out in 3D, which is crazy with the old retro graphics.
5350642	5352564	I'm going to check it out.
5352564	5352844	I will.
5352844	5354145	That's a threat.
5354145	5355686	Yeah.
5355686	5369657	And then in another fan created piece, you know where this is going, but a fan decided to do a fan made port of Link's Awakening to PC and Nintendo struck it down.
5370097	5372379	because that's what they do.
5372379	5377963	So I feel that they did this the correct way in the sense that they put it out.
5377963	5382806	What was kind of unique about this is so they put this on itch.io for a bit.
5382806	5387289	It actually had the full map was active all at one time.
5387289	5393754	So you could actually zoom all the way out to see the full map or zoom all the way in and play it that way.
5393754	5394835	It looked awesome.
5394835	5397937	I saw a clip of this on social media and I was like, dang, this looks cool.
5398137	5407011	But being that they did the smart thing, which is they finished it, then put it out, and then it got struck down, it's on the internet.
5407011	5410135	So you should be able to find it somewhere.
5410135	5411678	Hopefully.
5411678	5412459	I'd like to check it out.
5413339	5413599	DarkSakura
5433141	5437126	Disney Illusion Island has a free content update called The Keeper Up.
5450282	5467385	and it has a new Mavens of Monoth Time Trials feature, and just different accessibility features, gallery unlocks, a new map, and yeah, and I've actually never heard of this game.
5469460	5470180	It's cute.
5470180	5471601	Um, I've heard Bobby talk about it.
5471601	5473141	He plays- I don't like the art style.
5473141	5478043	He's played it with, uh, Jennifer and he, he thinks it's a good game that, uh, for them to play together.
5478043	5479603	They enjoy their time playing that.
5479603	5481424	I, it- I really don't like the art style.
5481424	5481864	Really?
5481864	5482524	I thought it looked cute.
5482524	5483364	Yeah, not at all.
5483364	5498449	I, you know, it's one of those things where it's like, if I only had time to play every single game I wanted to play, I'd play this, but you know, it's just- And also, I think I don't like it in the same way that I don't like, like the newer Transformers animated art style.
5498449	5498609	Hmm.
5500103	5501904	Yeah.
5501904	5503125	I'll play it if you won't.
5503125	5504786	All right.
5504786	5512792	Um, moving on, I want to talk about Oh, this this is fascinating to me because they have found a new cheat code for a game from 2009.
5512792	5515774	You remember cheat codes?
5515774	5522219	Okay, before all of our systems connected to the internet by default, and people figured out that you could sell things that way.
5522219	5526822	We used to have cheat codes in games where you would have like button presses and you can unlock things.
5526822	5528063	And just this week,
5529051	5536155	It was found that in the Gran Turismo port for PlayStation Portable, that's PSP.
5536155	5539097	Hey, Loki, remember olrpsp.com?
5539097	5539457	Yep.
5539457	5540418	Me too.
5540418	5543920	Anyway, the PSP, 14 years after this game came out,
5544915	5546357	This cheat code has been found.
5546357	5553064	The cheat codes, they unlock all the cars in the game and award the player 99 million credits.
5553064	5556307	Those are both things that would be microtransactions in this day and age.
5556307	5559231	That's the wild thing of this.
5559231	5565537	So the user on the subreddit and gtplanetboards, pes2k, I love that name,
5566158	5566238	and
5590828	5594070	You unlock all the cars so you can test all the cars.
5594070	5599894	You give somebody 99 million credits so you can test all of those features without having to play through the game like that.
5599894	5604577	These were probably things that were buried deep into the game and never came out.
5604577	5614444	So all you need to do to unlock all the cars, you hold down star and select and R and go up, right, left, left, square, up, right, right, up, triangle, right, up.
5616380	5620207	I'm sure that would have been found completely on its own.
5620207	5621770	That's a pretty complicated thing.
5623223	5625864	DarkSakura, you found that Link's Awakening?
5650758	5655501	Yeah, I found the fork of it too.
5655501	5657962	I can make sure that you get it.
5657962	5662905	I mean, I haven't gone looking for it yet, but just oh, it's on archive.org.
5662905	5664305	Quietly and privately.
5664305	5667087	Yeah, just send it to me on DM.
5667087	5669508	Just slide into my DMs and send me some link.
5669508	5670509	All right.
5670509	5677993	Um, let's travel around the world and check out some releases for those of you that are not going to the dark.
5677993	5678333	Black.
5679249	5683292	World Wide Web.
5683292	5685673	What's coming out for you this week?
5685673	5686854	Not a lot.
5686854	5689196	I mean, as expected.
5689196	5693919	So we've got Resident Evil 4 on Mac and iOS.
5693919	5700923	We have Princess Maker 2 Regeneration on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5700923	5704506	We have a game called One.
5704506	5707568	And that's on PC.
5707568	5707968	And that's it.
5709341	5712663	All right, it is a little bit slower a time of year.
5712663	5715304	Hey, but things are still trucking right along in Japan this week.
5715304	5721508	On the Nintendo Switch, we have 2045 Tsukiyori in a regular and limited edition coming out.
5721508	5727051	DC5, Decapo 5, also in regular and limited edition on the Switch this week in Japan.
5727051	5730373	The Curse of Kudan comes out in Japan this week.
5730373	5738518	Spy X Anya, Operation Memories is also out in Japan this week, as well as Fitboxing Presents Hop, Step, Dance.
5739238	5739759	Hop Step Dance
5749298	5753762	Rail Romanesque Origin also out in regular limited edition in Japan this week.
5753762	5763129	Sentimental Deathloop also out this week and one in a regular, you guessed it, limited edition because we love our limited editions in Japan.
5763129	5768193	On the PlayStation 5 this week, Baldur's Gate 3 gets a release in Japan on the PS5.
5768193	5769594	That game's kind of a big deal.
5769594	5771156	It's also a multi-language edition.
5771156	5775499	So I'm assuming that means they have some additional voice acting talent to support other languages.
5775499	5776560	Check that out.
5776560	5778902	And that same Spy x Anya
5779142	5785140	Anya, Operation Memories, also out in Japan this week.
5786038	5791240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5813973	5836330	Alright, well, we were just talking about leaks and stuff like that, and how Sony got hacked, and not necessarily directly Sony, but Insomniac Games has been hacked, and as part of that, some of the materials that were leaked from that kind of allude to games that are being worked on.
5836910	5852208	So for example, some of the names that came out from Insomniac Games there was some planned projects including Miles, RCE, SM2, SM3, and then one that's called...
5854059	5862085	It says additional support for Spider-Verse and Spider-Dash or whatever is one that's listed there.
5862085	5870812	So the thought is perhaps were they working on a Spider-Verse game, which I hope they are because that would be amazing.
5873348	5882113	But yeah, not too surprising to see that there's other Spider-Man games in development at Insomniac, obviously, because it's a successful franchise for them.
5882113	5885555	But yeah, Spider-Verse game, I'd be down for that.
5886328	5891614	Yeah, I think it's a neat direction for them to go in than to just like Spider-Man 3, you know what I mean?
5891614	5893056	I think it'd be kind of a neat thing for them to do.
5893056	5905230	They kind of did that too, like there was like, I don't remember who, it was back in Activision when they had the Spider-Man license, they used to do a lot of these different games that were just like the
5906411	5933403	great Spider-Man games tied in with the movies a little bit but then eventually they kind of spun off things to different like kind of they almost have like a spider-verse game I'm trying to remember what it's called it's like Shattered Something I don't remember but yeah it would be really cool to see that especially the art style is just amazing so if they were able to recreate that in-game it would just be it'd be
5934875	5937917	Just absolutely game of the year.
5937917	5939438	All right.
5939438	5942259	Uh, DarkSakura.
5942259	5944180	Uh, yeah, me.
5944180	5954566	Anyway, um, the Super Mario Brothers movie has been nominated for some Golden Globes.
5954566	5960970	Basically, the three awards are Best Animated Movie, Best Original Song, and Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.
5960970	5962151	So, yay!
5963346	5965247	and Y'all can watch it and let me know how it goes.
5982359	5992525	And the Golden Globes are kind of, I don't know, they've always been like the fun awards, but people also kind of try to look at them as like a barometer for the Oscars.
5992525	6000731	You know, and it's weird to talk about the Mario movie and Oscars, but I would assume two of these three categories, because the third doesn't exist.
6000731	6003773	The cinematic achievement thing isn't really an Oscar category.
6003773	6006355	That is a category added to get more people to watch the Globes.
6006355	6007275	That's what that is.
6007275	6011578	But I would assume, honestly, that the Mario movie is a shoe in for those other two categories at the Oscars.
6011658	6011958	Oscars
6033982	6034362	Barbie Songs
6049372	6057717	when the Mario movie with Bob Hoskins came out, that we would be sitting here talking about an Oscar nomination years later for the Mario movie in any form.
6057717	6059879	You know, that's pretty, pretty astounding.
6059879	6068104	Yeah, you know, Tigerlaw does bring up a good point is that if Peaches does get nominated, you would likely get a performance of it at the ceremony.
6068104	6072407	And he's suggesting that Jack Black can perform the song while wearing a Bowser costume at the Oscars.
6075227	6081212	Not outside the realm of possibility, and if you want to talk about things that will get people watching, I think that would be super cute.
6081212	6088578	Actually, I think all of the unnominated songs this year, because I think the Barbie performances, I think people would really want to see that too.
6088578	6093583	Because actually, Billie Eilish was on SNL last night, if I remember right.
6093583	6096065	I think she did do the sad Barbie song.
6096065	6098467	SNL is on my shit list.
6098467	6099348	Yeah, so it was...
6100839	6101199	Animated Movie
6118327	6120668	and probably a couple Disney movies.
6120668	6128690	I don't know, maybe... I could see it maybe winning Best Animated, but I think that's its best shot at actually winning anything at the Oscars.
6128690	6129350	We'll find out.
6129350	6136753	Oscar noms are out in early January, if I remember right, if they're still on the same timetable they used to be before COVID, so we'll see.
6136753	6139573	All right, a couple more stories for you.
6139573	6141494	And Loki, I think this one's hilarious.
6142737	6144278	Yes.
6144278	6159904	What do you give to those wonderful gamers out there that play a lot of Steam games but are also complete dicks when it comes to playing Steam games, especially those who cheat in Dota 2?
6159904	6163665	Well, you give them gift-wrapped bands.
6163665	6165026	That's right.
6165026	6167267	So apparently they were...
6169369	6177772	They were sending out, I want to say it was like a gift-wrapped lump of coal to these different players.
6177772	6185694	And it was actually, they had opened it and it says, oh, you're banned.
6185694	6187155	So yeah, it was great.
6189366	6192328	Happy Holidays, you're banned.
6192328	6200092	They have a Twitch streamer who has a clip from it and it's like, you've claimed a seasonal reward, a highly toxic lump of coal.
6200092	6208096	Your Dota account has been permanently banned for smurfing or other violations of the Steam Terms of Service.
6208096	6208756	Oh ho ho.
6211718	6214799	It's so good.
6214799	6216319	I love when they have that.
6216319	6221881	There have been people streaming and getting that live on their stream, right?
6221881	6225542	I don't know what meeting they came up with that in, but kudos to them.
6225542	6228763	That's the spirit of the holiday season.
6228763	6231144	Owning some cheaters.
6231144	6233265	Yeah.
6233265	6234305	All right.
6234305	6235446	It's great.
6235446	6235946	Love to see it.
6236331	6246303	Well, lastly here on our official show roll tonight, we have a pretty cool story about the efforts to preserve our industry in the years moving forward.
6246303	6255735	Unfortunately, so often we have stories that talk about how, you know, like the story about the crew tonight, about how video game preservation in many ways takes a step backwards.
6256195	6257196	But this is very cool.
6257196	6264880	The VGHF, or Video Game History Foundation, is going to be opening a digital version of its research library.
6264880	6273444	Through this digital library, it will have near-complete sets of magazines, art books, and rare historical materials.
6273444	6280748	And I get excited thinking about that rare historical material stuff because, you know, and I've talked about how cool I thought this game was a lot on this show.
6280748	6285391	I'm sorry if I'm sounding like a shill, but The Making of Karateka, the Gold Master Series game,
6286031	6305858	I thought some of the coolest stuff in that game was like actually getting to see like design documents and like letters that went back and forth between the publisher and Jordan Mechner who developed that game that really gave you a look behind the scenes for like how games were made in that era and like some of the actual feedback that was coming in on games and stuff like that.
6305858	6309019	So, you know, magazines and hype is one thing.
6309019	6310400	I think there's like, oh, God.
6310400	6312741	And here's here's here's the I'm sorry to to
6314241	6315322	Divert a little bit.
6315322	6319524	But I'm looking at the YouTube picture here, and I'll put it up on the other screen.
6319524	6328028	And for those on the podcast feed, it's the it's the the Video Game History Foundation announcing their digital library here.
6328028	6331989	But I noticed in the background, there's this player's strategy guide.
6331989	6336692	And specifically, there's this red one that talks about Dr. Mario with the yellow
6337452	6338932	I had this magazine.
6338932	6340193	I know I had this.
6340193	6344074	I know I had this because this is very familiar looking art to me.
6344074	6348375	And I bet you this is sitting in a box in my dad's garage somewhere right now.
6348375	6350195	In fact, I think I had at least three of these.
6350195	6354156	I'm pretty sure I had Fabio from Wizards and Warriors in that one too.
6354156	6358737	And the one above this, which I can't remember what it is, but that looks very familiar to me as well.
6358737	6360278	The other three don't look familiar.
6360278	6361378	Those three do.
6361378	6361578	So
6362418	6368768	It's it's just funny to me that these memories I have are now like in a museum digitally somewhere.
6368768	6370190	So.
6370190	6370470	Anyway.
6372156	6376499	As you can imagine, the goal of digitizing the entire archive is a lofty one.
6376499	6380001	It's going to take them some time, but that is a goal.
6380001	6388766	So the organization has been at this process for two years, and a lot of that has been designing the search technology and the interface platform.
6388766	6393189	The library will be launching at some point next year and have a sampling of the catalog.
6393889	6396511	Uh, but this, this just sounds awesome.
6396511	6400013	Keep in mind, it doesn't talk about being able to necessarily play games.
6400013	6408818	I mean, there's other places you can do that, but in this collection, print magazines, design documents, audio assets, press materials, concept art.
6408818	6410840	This is, this is going to be awesome.
6410840	6415482	Uh, kudos to the VGHF for getting involved with this.
6415482	6418204	I look forward to that finished archive.
6418204	6419545	So, all right.
6419545	6420966	Yeah, that's the kind of thing I eat up.
6421331	6421931	Yeah, I know.
6421931	6423012	I'm excited too.
6423012	6427795	I was like the day that opens DarkSakura, we should just do an unboxing stream.
6427795	6430997	We just jump in there and read it together.
6430997	6431597	We do that.
6431597	6432138	We'll do that.
6432138	6434900	Let's do an unboxing stream.
6434900	6436841	Alright, so it's got a very big box.
6439121	6440702	All right.
6440702	6444684	Anyhow, we want to invite you all to join us at the table here.
6444684	6448366	I will admit though, my voice is wearing as the night goes on.
6448366	6451008	So I don't know if we're going to keep going much longer.
6451008	6454690	But if you have any questions in chat and so forth, we'll go ahead and answer those.
6454690	6461174	Otherwise, I will look to Loki or DarkSakura if there's any last minute stories or last things to get out here before we wrap up for the night.
6462059	6472143	There's a little thing I saw just before we went live is that Google has extended the Bluetooth conversion for Stadia controllers.
6472143	6473104	Yeah, I heard about that.
6473104	6473844	To the end of 2024.
6473844	6476165	Yeah.
6476165	6479126	I didn't realize there was a hard stop on that at first.
6479126	6483728	Like if you didn't do it by then with your controller, it was a brick at that point, basically.
6483728	6489550	So, yeah, I'm still kind of deciding if I want to leave mine, you know, virgin.
6489550	6491151	Oh, just just for the novelty of it.
6492219	6504049	Yeah, because I mean I've got other controllers that I use and as much as I was, you know, a fan of Stadia, you know, at the same time,
6506532	6507353	I don't know.
6507353	6510574	I wonder if it would be like some sort of like collector's deal.
6510574	6515337	Hey, I have a pristine controller.
6515337	6516958	I'm going to be honest.
6516958	6519639	It would be hard when the platform no longer exists.
6519639	6521400	There's literally nothing.
6521400	6521760	I don't know.
6521760	6522981	But, you know, that's your choice.
6522981	6523761	It's your money.
6523761	6528683	So it depends on what I probably don't really care that much about what it means to you.
6528683	6528784	So.
6531145	6534208	All right, well, I do want to at least give the email bag a shout out.
6534208	6539232	Participate at OrangeLingerie.com is the place to send us any emails if you want us to talk about them in a future week.
6539232	6541593	I'd especially encourage this for next week.
6541593	6547318	It's probably going to be a bit of a slower news week this week, as I imagine most schools are starting their winter break this week.
6547318	6550741	Therefore, a lot of, you know, vacation times are starting and so forth.
6550741	6552382	Actually, maybe it is next week.
6552382	6554384	I think, Loki, when are your kids on break?
6555950	6556671	GameSite Staffers Top 10
6574948	6577029	That's the content that you can look forward to.
6577029	6585174	The same staffers at a very major website that wrote the most patronizing review of a video game I've ever seen and what they were talking about with Fortnite Festival.
6585174	6594300	And like, I get that that game has its drawbacks, and I too criticize, you know, how much they're charging for certain things, but my God, I felt like the article there was like talking to me like I was a four-year-old.
6594300	6596181	I was disgusted, quite frankly.
6596181	6599523	I mean, I just, who pissed in their cornflakes?
6601204	6602625	But I'm sure it gets clicks.
6602625	6605366	And here I here I am anger talking about it.
6605366	6607527	So maybe it works, but I'm not naming the site.
6607527	6609148	That's why I'm not doing it.
6609148	6610849	All right.
6610849	6613030	I do have a couple of things.
6613030	6628918	So starting off with, you know, we had talked about this in a while, but Epic Games versus Google in the whole Google Play Store thing, they won.
6629930	6632814	Oh yeah, I heard about this.
6632814	6642707	They won their trial basically saying that Google was participating in anti-competitive practices.
6642707	6647473	Also, Google was caught deleting evidence, so that's always
6648581	6652523	That's what, that's what, you know, innocent companies do.
6652523	6655745	They're going to still go to appeals for this, but they did.
6655745	6657665	That's why this story isn't done.
6657665	6658746	It's going to go up.
6658746	6661627	This is going to be decided by the Supreme Court.
6661627	6663068	It's in 2026.
6663068	6668371	But funny that they, you know, lost one and won this one.
6668371	6668631	Yeah.
6668631	6669011	Yeah.
6669011	6669751	It is weird.
6669751	6671052	Interesting.
6671052	6674694	It just goes to show, you know, you got to keep your stuff above the table.
6675393	6682757	Then there was that terrible game the day before that came out that was just an absolute piece of garbage.
6682757	6698066	The company that put that game out, Fantastic, certainly not a... quality doesn't match the name unfortunately, they said basically that they don't have money to continue the development of the game.
6698675	6710727	that they are basically just shutting the whole company down and it says they're working with Steam to open up refunds for any players who choose to make a refund.
6710727	6711929	Please refund the game.
6711929	6713290	The game doesn't work anymore.
6713290	6715913	It's already been delisted from Steam.
6715913	6717514	Get your refund already.
6717514	6718756	Don't give these people any money.
6721384	6724906	And, you know, obviously this game was like very hyped up.
6724906	6731470	The trailers and everything made it look like much, you know, obviously way better than it was.
6731470	6734452	And yeah, this is how it ends.
6734452	6739434	So great.
6739434	6740935	What else?
6740935	6741436	Yeah.
6741436	6750721	Oh, there is a tease, apparently, that there may be a free tier of Game Pass coming soon that's going to be supported by ads.
6752523	6753484	So that'd be interesting.
6766969	6770490	Yeah, well, I think they're mainly talking about other regions.
6770490	6783972	It says, you know, they said for models like Africa or India or Southeast Asia, maybe places that aren't console first, you can say, hey, do you want to watch a 30 seconds of an ad and they get two hours of game streaming?
6783972	6790433	OK, so they're saying that because those areas don't have a lot of disposable income, that that might be an option.
6790433	6796294	I mean, 30 seconds of an ad for two hours of game streaming.
6796934	6797655	Sign me up.
6797655	6805920	I mean, already, that's better than, like, the ad to, like, content ratio for, like, YouTube.
6805920	6809923	For two hours, jeez, you'd be watching probably 50 ads in that time.
6809923	6810223	Yeah.
6810223	6817789	So, I mean, obviously, it's not going to exactly be like that, but it is interesting to see something like that.
6818629	6819670	Neat.
6819670	6820990	Pretty incredible.
6820990	6822491	All right.
6822491	6827854	Well, I think that's going to do it for another episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6827854	6831335	Before we say goodnight, I do want to thank you as always for listening to our show.
6831335	6831876	Thank you.
6831876	6835517	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
6835517	6840160	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6840780	6844943	A nice 5-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show.
6844943	6851128	It goes an awful long way in helping us with discoverability, so we appreciate all of that as well.
6851128	6855131	I think that's about all I have to say, so I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
6855131	6859714	DarkSakura, I'll start with you, because I know you need to take a quick break before you start your stream.
6859714	6864738	So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
6864738	6866739	Don't read half the news, read all the news.
6866739	6868961	Look at history, and then look at all the history.
6869980	6872362	All right, have a good night.
6872362	6874903	Bye.
6874903	6877745	Loki, let's go to you.
6877745	6883229	Well, I've got a lot of work to do for editing.
6883229	6885911	Don't you always?
6885911	6886711	Story of my life.
6886711	6887091	Loki.
6887091	6892315	And then somewhere I need to like, I also need to get like programming time in to figure out all the
6892782	6894283	all those playdate stuff.
6894283	6898824	I think the whole idea of a golf game would be pretty cool.
6898824	6900265	I love the idea of a golf game.
6900265	6901786	I think you should get on that.
6901786	6902986	That's great.
6902986	6906868	You know, I didn't realize I wanted a playdate until you kind of talked about it last week.
6906868	6910869	So I still have to tell my husband things I want for the holidays.
6910869	6912030	They're nice.
6912030	6913010	Don't get me wrong.
6913010	6918693	I understand the point of not having the backlit screen stuff because they keep down a cost.
6919807	6921729	Man, do I wish it had a backlit screen.
6921729	6925914	It is hard to view this sometimes in just normal lighting.
6925914	6931901	You almost need that whole light attachment or whatever, like the Game Boys used to have and stuff.
6931901	6938328	But man, I would love a Gen 2 that had just the option to backlight that thing.
6938328	6939189	It would be great.
6941387	6964643	um and then my final thought tonight um I don't know I'm gonna hopefully I'm feeling better I actually did do a stream on Thursday and I really shouldn't have because I think it made me regress and how I was feeling but this this whole sick has been a journey but assuming I'm feeling better this next week I do I am gonna do some more streams I've talked to Shane hopefully we're gonna be able to do a stream together doing some WoW classic together that'll be fun
6965363	6968486	I also just, you know, have a ton of stuff in the backlog I'd like to keep playing.
6968486	6970547	Yes, Fortnite 2.
6970547	6971388	And who knows what else?
6971388	6978213	So yeah, until I get to that, I'll talk about that on social medias and all that good stuff.
