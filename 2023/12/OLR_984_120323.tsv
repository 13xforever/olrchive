9813	12534	Where were you when Killer Instinct returned one decade ago?
12534	15996	I was on the second floor of a building in San Francisco in an orange shipping crate.
15996	18657	Don't worry, it wasn't closed, and it wasn't used for shipping.
18657	24500	Shortly after its 10-year anniversary, we've learned that the PC version is adopting the payment model that its Xbone counterpart always had.
24500	28202	Free to play with one character, pay to unlock all content at any time.
28202	29522	This is the Breath of Life update.
29522	34885	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to also mention the story and talk about the rest of the week's gaming news.
34885	37086	Starting right now in the show, wherever gamer has a voice,
38953	41576	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41576	46101	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46101	48344	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48344	55532	We are back once again tonight with our show, episode number 984 for tonight, December the 3rd of 2023.
55532	57194	That's right, folks.
57194	59636	It's December and the year is almost over.
60197	67819	But we've got lots of video games to talk about tonight with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts here with me live every week on Sunday nights.
67819	68359	Say hello.
68359	76880	First and foremost, hanging out in the fog by the campfire, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
76880	77841	Hello, hello.
77841	83642	It looks like we see your peace sign, but you are muted on Discord because I see the little icon, the joys of doing the virtual stuff.
86478	88720	I just found something really disturbing.
88720	91583	Yeah, I love disturbing.
91583	97869	I was putting in my tags for Twitch and believe Jewish women is not allowed.
99184	127195	interesting is it I wonder if I can put the me too unless you're a Jew is it one of those like weird loopholes where it's just too long or do I don't I literally do not know it's interesting okay it won't let me add that either hmm I don't know um we use very boring ones here like podcast and uh twitch stream let me do the abbreviated one all right um but still
128666	130528	Never making an abbreviated appearance.
130528	133012	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
133012	134354	There's nothing abbreviated about me.
134354	135636	Sorry.
135636	136137	Well, how are you?
137165	137865	I'm fine.
137865	140847	And okay, so you love to play these games.
140847	143288	Well, at least have gameplay behind you.
143288	155295	As we tape live at Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, where we're at every single Sunday night.
155295	159897	And if you are watching live, I know many of you listen on the podcast feed, and we do appreciate you.
159897	163259	Thank you to all of you that showed up in our Spotify wrapped this week.
163699	176984	Uh, we got to, I don't know if you know this, but when you produce content for Spotify, you get a little rap that shows you the top countries that listen to your show and go figure the US and the United Kingdom are number one and number two.
176984	178004	How about that?
178004	183046	Anyway, uh, anyway, uh, Loki, uh, you have a game that plays behind you.
183046	183726	Uh, what is this?
183726	185686	Cause I, I don't know if I recognize this.
185686	186847	This is Broforce.
188537	194519	Oh, I think I played, I think this was like a free game on Xbox Gold or something.
194519	197500	I think I played just a hot minute of it.
197500	199200	And I, I didn't care for it.
199200	199821	I'm sorry.
199821	203162	But is this, is this a game that you enjoy?
203162	203582	It's a game.
203582	210504	It's in my library amongst all of those other games that I don't play the hundreds and hundreds of them.
211900	234640	so um allegedly uh you you have played this game but not really i have never played this game yeah it's in my backlog actually i may have booted it up at one time because i i know my um fellow channel 64 cast members have wanted to play this multiplayer and um we should that oh you know what i should have put on there you know
235307	240250	Because I've been watching lots of videos of it, as I should have done a long play of Lethal Company.
240250	243152	That looks fun.
243152	244513	It looks... it's strange.
244513	246454	It's also another game I probably won't actually play.
246454	247635	It seemed like Phasmo.
247635	249456	I just haven't played that.
249456	258603	But Lethal Company looks a little bit more interesting to me because it's got more of a Backrooms, SCP vibe to it, versus just ghost hunting, which is...
259465	266431	I mean, as a person who's done ghost hunting in real life once, um, it's all right.
266431	268393	Like, I wouldn't do it again.
268393	270715	As a seasoned ghost hunter, that one time I did it.
270715	275880	As a seasoned, I mean, compared to like the people on TV, yes, I am absolutely a seasoned ghost hunter.
275880	283667	But, um, yeah, I just rather like the backrooms SCP stuff's more interesting than ghost hunting is.
283667	284048	Gotcha.
284770	294078	Oh my gosh, alright, well let's get into our show tonight and we're gonna get right into our kickoff topic for tonight which is a pretty big story.
294078	306849	This is a big deal for multiple reasons and one of the reasons I think this is a big deal is I'm seeing this shared on social media by people that don't usually, I peg as people that follow the video game industry at least closely.
307489	317931	It's in that audience of people who play Mario Kart and Jackbox games at a party and played Pokemon Go a couple times in the summer of 2016.
317931	319951	Like that type, which there's nothing wrong with that type of gamer.
319951	321372	We love a casual gamer.
321372	326753	But I'm seeing lots of people sharing this story on social media.
326753	334654	Loki, would you care to tell us a little bit about the fuckery going on in the world of Hollywood meets video games this week?
335054	341260	So the long and short of it is it like a lot of people are pointing blame at Sony and it's not Sony.
341260	355233	It's Warner Discovery or just I don't know if it's just Discovery now, but it's Discovery, their shit show that is involved now with other content platforms, because what's going on basically is, you know,
355876	356957	on the PS4, PS5, PS4U, PS5, PS5, PS5, PS5, PS5, PS5,
370660	371140	probably
388231	392112	Oh, Naked and Afraid, that one I've heard of, because nudity is always going to get my attention.
392112	392513	Sorry.
392513	395134	Like, you know, because I watch me some Food Network.
395134	396694	So there was like Cake Boss.
396694	397714	I don't like Cake Boss.
397714	399575	I am more of a Duff Goldman fan.
399575	401976	I will die on that hill.
401976	407578	Shark Week stuff, CS to the Dress, you know, that trashy stuff.
407578	411219	Long Island Medium, going back to that Ghost Hunt team nonsense.
411219	412740	No, not the Long Island Medium.
414586	417548	Deadly Women, but more, you know, like actual shows people watch.
417548	419930	Mythbusters, for example, was part of that.
419930	436663	So what basically happened with this is actually, so because Discovery and Sony are having a kerfuffle about digital rights and stuff like that, they are now going to be removing their content off the platform.
436663	440907	But unlike games that get delisted, for example, on Sony's platforms,
441807	444950	They are actually taking this out of your library.
444950	454559	And this isn't shows that like people are paying like a monthly fee for, you know, PlayStation Now or whatever plus, um, to get access to it.
454559	461925	These are shows that like you went and purchased this, you downloaded it and it's supposed to be in your library.
461925	465008	But then now they're like, well, no, we're taking that back.
466129	468990	It literally cannot be on your platform at all.
468990	471391	Which they feel that they should be refunding you at that point.
471391	472072	Right?
472072	473612	That was my next logical question.
473612	474373	But they're not!
474373	481296	So if I spent $15, I don't even know what the cost is, but I'm gonna say, let's say I spent $15 to get the first full season of Cake Boss.
481676	486017	because I just, I need my cake inspirations on demand.
486017	493258	I need to be able to, you know, see these cakes, freeze frame the cakes so I can recreate the cakes, nailed it, you know, that whole thing on my time.
493258	506241	So you're saying that Warner Brothers Discovery is literally, literally, literally going to sneak into my house in the middle of the night, take it out of my home and put it back in their vault.
507268	509149	Merry Christmas.
509149	510449	Happy Hanukkah.
510449	511790	Merry Kwanzaa.
511790	513670	So yes, all of it.
513670	530817	They basically said as of December 31st, 2023, due to our licensing or our content licensing agreements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library.
530817	533618	We sincerely thank you for your continued support.
533618	536679	That sounds just like Konami like last week or so with the
537139	543904	You know, hey, you're banned from this tournament, but please, please, please use our products still, you know.
543904	551350	But even when Konami removed PT from the store, they didn't go on my PlayStation and remove it there.
551350	560177	In fact, the ability to get that demo and still play it on a PlayStation is like that, that underground thing that cool people
561400	563022	Try to do to impress their friends.
563022	565846	Like, oh yeah, I got a PlayStation 4 that still plays PT.
565846	568129	Wanna see the trailer?
568129	570532	You know, it's still a power move, right?
570532	572315	They didn't erase it from your place.
572315	574458	They probably would have if they could have.
575253	581758	So it's probably what it's weird a little bit that Warner Brothers Discovery can do this.
581758	585861	And I understand before I because I know somebody's typing a correction in chat right now.
585861	588023	So stop before you hit enter.
588023	593847	I know that little fine print that we all agree to when we sign up for the store.
593847	594588	We're going to.
594588	598050	I know that little fine print does give them the right to do this.
598050	598671	It's in there.
598671	599952	If you actually read through it.
600853	602857	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
611104	611864	Yeah, exactly.
611864	616666	Because if you think about it, like, what is this saying then for piracy?
616666	624550	Piracy now is giving you a better experience than doing the right thing and purchasing your content legally.
624550	630593	Because piracy, you can download, like, and this is, there was a video that was done by
631913	633154	Oh, I don't remember the guy.
633154	635537	The guy that does Mac repair stuff all the time.
635537	638580	He's an advocate for, like, write the repair and all that.
638580	639280	Lewis Rossman.
639280	651652	So, Lewis Rossman was talking about how he decided to subscribe to Netflix, their 4K package, because he wanted to stream 4K video on his TV.
651652	654295	And apparently, because his TV
655436	657479	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
671420	699036	and you would have to have like specific devices and specific ways to do that in order to actually get the content and he's like well I'm paying for 4k and you're serving me 720p I am getting a worse experience than if I go on the internet and just go download this and it will be 4k and I can play it on any device I want to it doesn't matter I am not limited by all of these loopholes that you're or all these loop hoops that you're making me jump through it's stupid so once again
699056	699316	again
716368	723335	through these legitimate avenues that you offered your content through because you're being a little whiny bitch about it.
723335	727620	Now you're saying that you're giving the green light to everybody to go pirate your shit.
727620	733165	Not that you really should because it's pretty crap, a lot of it, but that's basically what you're doing.
733165	736409	I mean, if you really want to pirate Kate Boss, like, don't share that.
737324	746729	I mean, like, okay, here's some of the wonderful series that are on here that I have never heard of, but, like, they're basically, I mean, it's like TLC bullshit.
746729	751731	I mean, I think Discovery owns TLC as well, but, like, Graveyard Cars.
751731	753032	What?
753032	756073	Um, Gypsy Sisters.
756073	757614	Uh, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.
757614	758535	Ooh, yeah.
758535	760876	We weren't supposed to say that word, anyway.
760876	761836	Okay, they called it a TV show.
761836	763897	That's the name of a show.
763897	765058	I don't doubt it.
765058	765358	Alright.
766110	770611	It that's the they have four seasons of I'm kidding.
770611	771192	I'm kidding.
771192	772012	Right.
772012	779034	Um, you know, Hillbilly Summer, Hoarding, Buried Alive.
779034	780134	All right, I get we get it.
780134	780595	We get it.
780595	793419	These are these are definitely like crap niche shows that people only watch when they're high and want to feel better about their own lives because there's, you know, people out there that have it worse, I guess is basically how you'd sum up a lot of those shows.
793419	794219	So, um,
796149	798510	Yeah, this is, this is, this is crappy.
798510	799991	It's going to drive people to piracy.
799991	803373	There will be a lawsuit anyway, even though people have agreed that there will be a lawsuit.
803373	804014	But guess what?
804014	805415	Do you know what that lawsuit's going to do?
806400	807941	Not a goddamn thing.
807941	811862	That lawsuit is going to get some lawyers paid, seven figures.
811862	818305	But those of you that spent $15 on a season for Honey Boo Boo, for whatever reason, that's your fucking right.
818305	825928	If you want to buy Here Comes Honey Boo Boo Season 1, God damn it, as an American, that is your Canadian or wherever else this marketplace is at.
825928	829090	That's your right to buy that and enjoy at your leisure.
829090	830410	And you have that right.
830410	833011	But do you know what you are going to get for spending 15 bucks?
833011	834072	You're not going to get anything.
834352	842676	you're going to get a pat on the ass, told a job well done and a 99 cent coupon to use at the one remaining block store or blockbuster store in America.
842676	843117	That's it.
843117	844757	That's what you're going to get from that settlement.
844757	846278	Nothing of actual use.
846278	851301	And here's the thing though, too, about this is like, you have to understand that like, this is something that can happen anywhere.
851301	858745	So like I was, you know, talking about this with some friends and they're like, Oh yeah, I've got all these videos on VUDU.
858745	861806	Yeah, literally that service could just up and disappear one day.
861806	863127	Yeah.
863127	863247	And
864181	865742	Yeah, it's all gone.
865742	866623	Sorry.
866623	868504	Like, it's just gone.
868504	869825	That's the problem with digital.
869825	873728	Digital is, you have to trust the content partners for it.
873728	877811	And honestly, like, when it comes to movie studios and stuff, I don't trust anybody.
877811	881274	Nobody should trust Warner Brothers Discovery at this point for anything.
881534	881614	and
908618	914341	That's very important as well as that trust, because I look at a platform like Steam.
914341	923185	Steam has come out and said, why do we all spend oogles of money that we probably shouldn't be spending just to inflate our Steam backlog with games we should never play?
923185	930788	Because Steam has said, and it is in their terms, if Steam ever goes away, those games will be yours.
930788	934330	The DRM button gets pushed and those games are yours for all eternity.
935149	936009	Allegedly.
936009	939091	Assuming the servers will still work for those games.
939091	941792	I'm looking at a thing like Dead by Daylight.
941792	944233	Someday, someday, Behaviour is going to say no.
944233	945733	That would be Behaviour servers.
945733	946153	That's right.
946153	947654	That would be Behaviour and not Steam.
947654	950435	So that is, that is, you know, whatever company you're trusting.
951195	970350	DarkTetsuya case and point in chat says AntStream and a lot of you aren't keeping tabs on this service cause it's a little bit, you know, it's niche, it's retro cloud, right?
970350	975154	AntStream already has lost the WB Midway stuff.
976147	983936	So those classic Midway games, including Mortal Kombat, that were originally on the Anstream service, they are no longer available.
983936	993126	Now, that situation is a little different because when you're paying for the cloud access, like a Netflix night, like a Hulu, you know, the games come and go.
993126	996690	So nobody's going to be able to set, you know, you could decide if you want to renew Anstream or not.
996690	997231	However,
998382	1000644	It's definitely, again, we're talking about that company loyalty.
1000644	1003906	It's showing where WB is laying their hand right now.
1003906	1004847	Let's be real.
1004847	1008549	I'm sure there are lots of hardworking, wonderful people at Warner Brothers Games.
1008549	1009850	There's lots of great people.
1009850	1015915	So we should really call the problem what it is, and that is David Zaslav is the problem.
1018402	1033073	another billionaire who gets away with billionaire shit and tax write-offs like that Batgirl movie that was gonna be diverse, fun, looked great, gets pulled to be a tax write-off.
1033073	1034434	A Scooby-Doo sequel even?
1034434	1034795	That's right.
1034795	1036156	Like the animated thing?
1036156	1036776	You name it.
1036776	1045203	There's a ton of shit out there that so David Zaslav can pocket more money with a tax write-off.
1046485	1049410	And let's call, again, David?
1049410	1052074	Sounds like the name of the Bond villain.
1052074	1057463	I was just saying this on Bobby's show, it sounds like the villain in the Superman movies, Neil before Zaslav.
1057463	1060147	I think if I go back and watch it, that's what I'm going to hear from now on.
1060970	1065295	Yes, and Dark to See Us is the Wile E. Coyote Acme movie we lost out on too.
1065295	1067577	And people, I know, I already know the internet.
1067577	1073623	I already know the fucking blue checks on Twitter and what they would say in response to this if I bothered to fucking read that hellhole anymore.
1073623	1078008	And that would be, you're upset about a movie you didn't get to see?
1078008	1078308	Really?
1078308	1079950	You're upset about a movie you didn't get to see?
1081532	1083433	Excuse me, bitch.
1083433	1088054	I'm upset for all those hardworking people that worked on that movie.
1088054	1098198	I'm upset for that actress who is really excited to play Batgirl and take on that role, who now doesn't get to do that on that platform because a billionaire needed to have another fucking yacht.
1098198	1101159	And the laws of this country let him get away with it.
1101159	1109622	Because the politicians, I'm sorry, the politicians out there have literal fucking brain worms in the rocks between their ears.
1110382	1114609	and focus on bullshit that doesn't matter in this country.
1114609	1118334	And this includes, I could go on and on because this includes the fucking media.
1118334	1122120	I don't give a fuck about George Santos.
1122120	1125385	Never put him on my TV screen again.
1125385	1125765	Never.
1127006	1130567	I know he will be on Dancing with the Stars next season and this upsets me already.
1153143	1155244	George Santos is a moron.
1184117	1199129	And it's anything, it's, you know, just the people are not looking at things that are actually important to what we do here in the U.S., you know.
1199129	1205814	And they're blaming the first factor that comes up.
1205814	1208777	And this is human nature is to always look for a scapegoat, you know.
1209775	1214638	But they point fingers at the wrong parties.
1214638	1219521	And that's what I mean, that's kind of what they're doing with with this situation you were talking about, right?
1219521	1220762	Yeah.
1220762	1226406	Fifth Ream in chat says it's good to keep an eye on a horrible people in power to make sure they don't get away with it.
1226406	1233070	Well, the problem and it's not that I disagree with you, but the problem is these fucking billionaires keep getting away with it time and time again.
1233737	1236601	And it's getting old.
1236601	1237602	And you know what?
1237602	1238904	I do not feel bad.
1238904	1244271	My point is, I do not feel bad at this point about pirating anything about WB or Discovery.
1246047	1249929	And that's, you know, I know we're not supposed to talk about piracy.
1249929	1251170	It's not something we're supposed to promote.
1251170	1252590	Well, then you tell me.
1252590	1259814	Like, the thing that really shocks me in this whole scenario is that somehow that Batgirl movie hasn't leaked, or any of the other projects that have been named.
1259814	1266357	I'm hung up on Batgirl because I used to fucking love Batman and Batgirl, the 60s show that was rerun when I was a kid and all that stuff.
1266357	1269759	But anyway, my point is, I'm surprised that shit hasn't leaked to the internet.
1270379	1277744	And that, I really, really, really need somebody in Hollywood who has the ability to do it, to leak that shit to the internet.
1277744	1278945	Please do it.
1278945	1281367	Please do it.
1281367	1289753	All it takes is one hacker to go in there and start dumping stuff.
1289753	1291214	It's like Sony all over again.
1293740	1298587	Anyway, um, yeah, so I know it's it's just TV shows and so forth.
1298587	1300209	But it's it's it's the precedent.
1300209	1303534	It's the fact that they can take something away from you that you bought and why
1304696	1304776	and
1327705	1334132	On paper maybe you can do that, but the IRS or somebody's gotta go like, wait a second, we gotta look into that.
1334132	1336074	That seems a little fishy.
1336074	1346524	And before we get the emails saying there's nothing proving that this particular decision is based on a tax write-off, I would still say that at the end of the day it's all culminating to the bottom line.
1346624	1356660	And if it was a, if it was a, you know, residual disagreement or something or some sort of like Warner felt like they weren't getting enough money from the PlayStation Store, then fine, remove your shit from the store.
1356660	1359305	Why are they taking it off of people's devices?
1359305	1360647	They shouldn't have to go that far.
1361966	1364187	So it's just, it's wild.
1364187	1364967	Yeah.
1364967	1371210	The furthest we've seen this before, um, previously was where you'd have like your cable company or whatever.
1371210	1378333	It'd be different cable providers and they would remove certain channels off of your, you'd be paying for them.
1378333	1380234	Satellite and channels.
1380234	1380434	Yeah.
1380434	1381194	Local TV.
1381194	1381875	Yeah.
1381875	1382375	All that stuff.
1383055	1391346	So yeah, it's... I mean, which is the same, because you're paying for everything, but you're not... you're getting less product, so... I mean, but it's... yeah.
1391346	1394170	I guess if you still... why?
1394170	1397534	Want to support them, you buy physical media, um...
1398175	1425985	and that's kind of why like right there there's a perfect example why physical media will never go away it's because these companies are saying hey you can't trust us to you know you you can't trust us to allow you to give us money and then we give you the product that you get to keep it's just you know it's not a guarantee whereas at least if i purchase a physical piece of media it's mine until it breaks so i don't know
1426670	1437236	Well, not only now not only do you need a piece of physical media, but you need to be able to back up that physical media in case like you said it breaks or because because otherwise, you're going to lose that thing forever someday.
1437236	1442999	So and that's that's to even do you think you can buy Honey Boo Boo and a physical edition anymore?
1443803	1444804	No, but they're doing that.
1444804	1448327	They're doing you a favor for selling out of the store.
1448327	1449829	And I'm sure you probably can.
1449829	1453873	I mean, people have it and then they sell it secondhand.
1453873	1456155	Um, you know, and that's the other thing too.
1456155	1459358	Secondhand with physical media, you can get it cheaper.
1459358	1461781	Like there's a negotiation process there.
1461781	1462041	I mean,
1463621	1464081	I don't know.
1464081	1466162	I love digital in the sense that it's convenient.
1466162	1478944	When it comes to like small indie games and stuff like that, I will support people like that with Steam and all that, but yeah, buying stuff digitally on like platforms, like even on my PlayStation 4 and stuff, it's great.
1478944	1485946	So I'm on PlayStation 4, but now whenever I get a PlayStation 5 or 6 or whatever, am I going to be able to access that stuff?
1485946	1486706	Probably not.
1488015	1492538	Yeah, because I don't think you can actually access PlayStation 3 bot stuff on your 5 or anything.
1492538	1495360	I think that did change some time ago.
1495360	1500003	DJRamaS in chat says, there was a call for a federal investigation of WBD, Warner Bros.
1500003	1502805	Discovery, after the whole Wile E. Coyote movie debacle.
1502805	1503166	You know what?
1503166	1509130	I remember that because I remember a lot of people were laughing at it going, isn't there a better use of our government's time?
1509130	1512792	And I think this should make everybody give pause and say, you know, it's the precedent.
1512792	1513613	And yeah, maybe
1514073	1518937	Maybe we do need to look into the underlying issue, which is why are they getting tax write-offs?
1518937	1521999	Why is David Zaslav allowed to do this?
1521999	1525842	And to answer the question, whether is it a good use of their time or not?
1525842	1526482	Yes, it is.
1526482	1531006	Because the reason why we have departments out there that this is what they do.
1531006	1535569	They look into antitrust and corporate malpractice and stuff like that.
1535569	1537030	And that is their purpose.
1537030	1539733	It's not like we're asking the Senate to look into it.
1539733	1541054	Like, who cares what they think?
1541054	1542915	Like, there are other bodies out there that
1543395	1567135	They're regulatory bodies that look into these type of things because yeah, it's a major loophole if you have a company that's essentially Finding it like a free money glitch type of thing by canceling projects when they're finished, you know Wouldn't you want to stop that so that we're not so us taxpayers aren't paying for you know Zaslav's fifth, you know House or whatever.
1567135	1570898	I mean, come on like, of course, yeah, it's in the best interest of the people and
1571038	1576799	For anyone that thinks an investigation of the Wile E. Coyote movie is a waste of the government's time, I've got two fucking words for you.
1576799	1577880	Hunter Biden.
1577880	1580960	Thank you.
1580960	1583061	Anyway.
1583061	1583401	Let's move on.
1583401	1589022	But you know what I hear is on his laptop, a full copy of Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner.
1589022	1590383	That's why they're after it.
1590383	1591083	It's so important.
1593777	1594678	I hate you, but I don't.
1594678	1595118	I love you.
1595118	1602324	All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1602324	1603886	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1606033	1607294	It was the usual.
1607294	1612238	I played some Dead by Daylight, I played Rudra no Hiho.
1612238	1616421	I'm getting done with the first scenario very soon.
1616421	1620383	And I played some Disney Dreamlight Valley.
1620383	1625087	The rest of my time, really, though, because we're gearing up for a recital and someone quit.
1626607	1634879	So we had to sit and redo most of the choreography and it took us two hours yesterday and we even ran through it.
1634879	1637482	We were working on this for a while.
1637482	1640627	So I'm ready to scream.
1640627	1642710	I'm like, that's been
1644401	1654270	Sitting back and playing games, I don't want to play anything that's going to get me emotionally charged, because all I'm going to do is think about how irritated I am.
1654270	1655912	Does that make sense?
1655912	1661717	So I'm trying to play mostly easy, cozy things, but I am going to do Killer Night later.
1664755	1674479	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out the ever surprising comment, I played Dead by Daylight 2 this week, but clarifying the pinball table in Pinball M, the M rated version of Pinball FX.
1674479	1677059	I had no idea that that came out, but apparently it did on Friday.
1677059	1677840	I want to check that out.
1677840	1680741	That sounds fun.
1680741	1682021	I do love me some pinball.
1682021	1686703	Bonnie needs to play the Debbies with us.
1686703	1688964	He would hide in a locker the whole time and you know it.
1688964	1690064	And I say that with love.
1690064	1691505	All right.
1692631	1695513	So, but would he play Dwight while he does it?
1695513	1698195	Uh, probably because I don't see him.
1698195	1705379	I think the only way you would ever get him to play would be with a game pass version of the game, which only comes with like what the stock four heroes and bill.
1705379	1707841	So yes.
1707841	1708381	Bill.
1708381	1709742	All right.
1709742	1712864	Anyway, uh, then Loki, we'll go to you and your gaming week.
1713912	1716354	My gaming week was just Minecraft.
1716354	1720837	I finished editing up a video for the RazeWorks server stuff.
1720837	1726100	I'm done with, well, I've been done with, for my Channel 64 content.
1726100	1729463	I need to film a bunch of stuff for that.
1729463	1732945	Now someone pranked one of my builds, so I gotta film more content for that.
1732945	1734906	So I'm hoping to work on that this week.
1734906	1741791	I started also actually editing the newest episode of the RazeWorks server as well.
1741791	1743112	In fact, we did like a live
1743912	1745433	MC Rewind
1764818	1773842	I think it's supposed to be like kind of like YouTube Rewind in the sense they're going to have a video that they put out for it, but it's also just a server with people playing together.
1773842	1786667	So I have to design builds for that at some point here very soon because it kicks off in exactly two weeks from yesterday, the 16th.
1786667	1788268	So it runs for a month.
1791223	1793264	All right, well, let's see my gaming week.
1793264	1803131	So I want to talk a little bit about what I did today, because I went out today for a variety of events that were happening in AR games I play.
1803131	1806033	And I think you all know that I love to play the AR games.
1806033	1811696	Most of them happen to be made by Niantic, though I'm certainly open to trying games of a certain quality by other companies.
1811696	1815479	I've talked a lot about Orna on this show and some other games as well.
1815479	1820442	But today was kind of focused on the Niantic stuff, which for whatever reason, they tend to all kind of happen at once.
1820942	1826306	So there was a Pikmin Bloom event happening today for walking 10,000 steps to get a badge there.
1826306	1826746	So great.
1826746	1827627	You got to move around.
1827627	1828227	Fine.
1828227	1831309	But there was also concurrent events going on in Pokemon Go.
1831309	1843238	I think this is the one most of our listeners probably know about because there was the Suiyan, I think if I'm saying that right, Samurott, that is available only today in raids.
1843238	1847120	So a lot of people were getting together to go raid together between, I think it's
1848121	1848542	2PM and 5PM.
1865822	1868464	I deserve this because I always get screwed in these events.
1868464	1871065	So today, today's my special day.
1871065	1872066	So I was very happy about that.
1872066	1887354	But the fun thing was, is that we were also, while we were doing that, we were also trying to play Monster Hunter Now, which had a black Diablos event going on, which that monster isn't usually in the game, but was only doing it today.
1887354	1888054	So yes, we would
1888374	1895378	We would try to drive around looking for desert biomes, then pull over, because we just did it in neighborhoods, because Monster Hunter now is everywhere.
1895378	1899780	So we'd pull over in front of somebody's house, take down the black Diablos, and then move on to the next one.
1899780	1903182	So we were doing all of that.
1903182	1906943	And then when we ended up at a park, we were walking around playing Pokemon Go.
1908144	1922926	Here's my kind of point with all this is that when we were doing one of the raids, you know, there were other people there doing it too, which is interesting, because we were at a place that, like, usually for these events, people go downtown Capital Park, that's like the place you expect to see people.
1922926	1924187	We were we were in a park
1924668	1928669	in South Sacramento, because that's where our adventures on Monster Hunter took us.
1928669	1932810	And there was a whole marathon going on downtown today, which was kind of in the way and annoying anyway.
1932810	1933930	So we kind of wanted to get away from that.
1933930	1938871	So we went more south of that, and we were randomly raiding with some other people.
1938871	1949493	And when we were talking about walking over to some other gyms, this girl who had jumped in the last raid with us was like, hey, can I join your next raid or whatever?
1949493	1951194	So I have a crew to do it with.
1951194	1952814	Like, yeah, sure, of course, you can do it.
1953394	1956356	Um, and so we scanned her into the party.
1956356	1956776	We did that.
1956776	1960519	And then we found out through that she also plays Monster Hunter now.
1960519	1968344	So while we were walking to the gyms, we were doing the Black Diablos as a foursome now instead of a threesome with my friends and all that.
1968344	1976329	And then I just happened to notice while we were doing like one of the last raids, I noticed that she had a bag that said Final Fantasy Fan Festival.
1976329	1979652	And I was like, holy shit, were you in Vegas at the fan festival?
1979652	1980692	She's like, I was.
1980692	1982954	And I was like, oh man, this was the first year that I couldn't go.
1983414	1991799	And so we were talking about that, we were doing games and whatever, and she actually, and this is really funny because I never talked about the fact that I do a podcast or any of this stuff, but she actually was like, do you like Emmett Selk?
1991799	1993280	And I'm like, of course.
1993280	1995902	Oh, sorry, I just hit a button that caused my computer to freeze.
1995902	1996642	Okay, there we go.
1996642	1997703	Hopefully we didn't lose any frames.
1999284	2000744	She's like, do you like Emmett Selk?
2000744	2004366	And I'm like, if you've ever played FF14, yes, you like Emmett Selk.
2004366	2008487	He's the bad guy, but in one of those, like, maybe he has a point kind of things.
2008487	2018390	So he actually gave me, or I'm sorry, she actually gave me a little sticker that I guess she must do art or something, and actually gave me this little sticker of Emmett Selk.
2018390	2025712	And my point is, this was all because of Pokemon Go and meeting up and doing these things.
2025712	2026512	So I will say this.
2027588	2033658	for all the shit that we've given Niantic about the return to real world and doing things in person and all this stuff.
2033658	2039669	And I do still totally agree that the remote raid stuff they did, you know, reverting changes is never a good thing.
2039669	2040170	However,
2041380	2046863	maybe they do have a point sometimes about getting people out into the real world and join up together and do these things.
2046863	2050586	Because you do get cool interactions like this that happened today.
2050586	2053187	And yeah, now, and now we're Pokemon Go friends.
2053187	2059071	And I found out she's on the, the server where I started playing 14, Midgarcimer.
2059071	2059812	She's on Midgarcimer.
2059812	2060592	That's where she plays.
2060592	2062073	And there's not a lot of people on that server.
2062073	2063514	So I was like, wow, small world.
2063514	2067637	So I mean, that's, that was a feel good gaming story for me today.
2067637	2069698	Like making a new friend because of Pokemon Go for real.
2070489	2078739	Yeah, it's nice to have those interactions, but I know that's not Niantic's motivation for those changes, it's money, so... No, of course it is, of course it is.
2078739	2084627	I mean... My friend had to buy potions because she ran out and doing the Black Diablos, so, of course, of course.
2084627	2084947	Mm-hmm.
2084947	2085147	So...
2086569	2090371	Mike Deft in chat says, I think it's not that people don't want this.
2090371	2092692	It's more like giving people options to do so.
2092692	2093213	Absolutely.
2093213	2094494	And I do agree.
2094494	2099177	And, you know, we were also when we were doing these raids, I was remote inviting anyone that I saw online.
2099177	2101718	I think, Deft, you actually got in one of our raids that we were doing.
2101718	2105381	So that was actually as we were walking around doing those.
2105381	2106681	Yeah, that was those.
2106681	2110704	I think I caught my second shiny on that raid you were in, Deft, actually, now that I think about it.
2110704	2111605	So, yeah.
2111605	2113526	So I was just inviting whoever I saw online.
2113826	2117889	I think I sent SSJ100Matt like seven raid invites because I was like, well, he's on the East Coast.
2117889	2119309	It's already over out there.
2119309	2122992	But I think at some point I figured out, oh, he probably just doesn't have any remote passes.
2122992	2126234	So I just invite whoever I see.
2126234	2131937	Never feel you have to accept those invites because I never do because I refuse to buy remote raid passes.
2131937	2135460	So that's unless the game gives me one for free.
2135460	2136460	I'm never going to do it.
2136460	2137601	So that's that.
2138536	2140658	Anyway, well hope you got some shinies, Deft.
2140658	2156751	By the way, I did check in with Shane, because if you do know, our Pokemon-loving friend, Pokemon-obsessed friend Shane, does play Pokemon Go when there's something that interests him in it, and Oshawott is like his favorite Pokemon.
2156751	2158353	So he loves the whole line, right?
2158353	2159834	So he loves Samurott and all that, right?
2161485	2177492	So today was a big day for him, and I did get the update that, and I'm gonna quote the text message here so I get it right, 33 raids, 2 broke on the catch screen, but they weren't shiny, 5 of them were shiny.
2177492	2181393	So that means he caught 26 regulars and 5 shinies.
2181393	2183854	You math that out.
2183854	2185715	You were curious how hard people went today.
2187102	2196006	I think I did maybe 10 raids tops, but all of us in our little group got at least one shiny that we were walking around with, so that was fun.
2196006	2196826	All right, but that was fun.
2196826	2197506	That was my gaming week.
2197506	2200908	Otherwise, oh, I guess there is one other thing I should talk about during my gaming week.
2200908	2203369	This is another interesting... Sorry, I'm taking up time, but oh well.
2203369	2205590	I actually played some different games.
2205590	2210072	Well, this one's not different, but I played World of Warcraft because...
2211587	2219053	In World of Warcraft Classic right now, they're doing this thing called the Season of Discovery that just started Thursday.
2219053	2223897	So it's the old school World of Warcraft with zero expansions, right?
2223897	2229382	But the level cap is 25 to force people to pace themselves a little bit.
2229382	2233685	And they've added this new system that didn't exist in Classic WoW.
2234707	2243338	So now it's Classic WoW Plus because now there is a rune system that works like enchanting that gives your character different abilities that they might not have otherwise.
2243338	2247903	And with these abilities, mages can now heal if they want.
2247903	2253230	Rogues and shamans and warlocks can all now tank if they want with these abilities.
2253670	2256652	I'm playing a balanced druid for the lulz.
2256652	2263056	And one of the abilities, for example, you get Sunfire, which was an ability I don't think they introduced until Cataclysm.
2263056	2266498	But with the rune, you can actually get Sunfire, which you can get early on.
2266498	2270541	So it's neat that they're kind of putting a twist on classic WoW.
2270541	2277585	And I'm really into it, even though I also really miss the quality of life perks that modern MMOs bring.
2278826	2282328	Um, there's a certain amount of charm to it that I'm actually really enjoying.
2282328	2286411	And the reality is Final Fantasy 14 is super in a lull for me right now.
2286411	2288793	I've done everything I'm going to do in the Diablo 4 season.
2288793	2290994	So it's like now is the right time for this to happen.
2290994	2292655	So yeah, I'm into it.
2292655	2294397	I got up to level 12.
2294397	2295657	I think I'm at right now.
2295657	2297058	So I'll probably log in later.
2297058	2300381	But I, I have to get my last steps in for Pikmin Bloom.
2300381	2307765	So as soon as the show is done, I have to go walk the neighborhood in the dark to get my last thousand steps I need to get the stupid medal for today because I'm not letting it pass by.
2307765	2308226	No, I'm not.
2309266	2317250	Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, it sounds a little like the blood abilities from Diablo 4 that can buff up your toon in wild ways for this season.
2317250	2324153	Yeah, but it kind of has that extra perk of like letting characters do roles they wouldn't normally do, like a mage healer.
2324153	2326574	That's that's weird, but it's it's fun.
2326574	2328956	And that's what's fun about the whole season of Discovery.
2328956	2334038	So for as much shit as Blizzard gets for turning all of their content into season passes,
2334518	2337921	that you're seeing in Overwatch, that you're seeing in Diablo.
2337921	2344066	And actually, interestingly enough, I'm kind of surprised Warcraft doesn't have a Season Pass.
2344066	2345748	It's just what they're calling the Season Discovery.
2345748	2348030	But I think in that case, they're still getting your sub.
2348030	2350852	You have to have an active sub to play WoW Classic, but that's all you need.
2350852	2352634	You don't have to buy any actual WoW.
2352634	2354656	You just have to pay that sub, but they're still getting that money.
2354656	2358079	So I guess, you know, ain't nothing free.
2358079	2360441	But yeah, I'm enjoying it enough.
2360441	2360741	It's fun.
2362453	2367259	Questbuster in chat says, I was super curious why so many streamers were doing WoW recently, but this explains it.
2367259	2368240	Sounds like a fun system.
2368240	2370582	Yeah, it just launched Thursday.
2370582	2375187	So yeah, you probably had a lot of streamer friends that were doing it Thursday, Friday and on into this weekend.
2375187	2378330	So and probably keep doing it if they bring out drops or something as well.
2380540	2382762	Alright, well we have some stories to get into.
2382762	2385824	I first want to make sure I also shout out happening this week.
2385824	2388186	So we do have a few news stories for you tonight.
2388186	2395091	There's still some things going on in the gaming industry, but I do want to point out this week's going to be a big week in gaming news, right?
2395091	2398073	We've got the Game Awards coming up on Thursday.
2398073	2403638	We will be doing a live stream here at the Voice Geeks Network for the Game Awards, so if you want to watch along with us,
2404318	2410662	And we try to, I promise, one thing we try to do, we're critical, but we're not overly negative.
2410662	2412243	There's very much a difference.
2412243	2417906	So we try to keep it positive and fun and really about a celebration of games.
2417906	2419067	So we'll be live streaming.
2419067	2421248	I know it'll be at least Bobby Blackwell and myself.
2421248	2425431	I don't know if anyone else plans to join us, but they're more than welcome.
2425431	2428292	4.30 Pacific, 7.30 Eastern on Thursday.
2428292	2432175	So we're going to be live streaming the Game Awards and get our reactions to all the stuff.
2432975	2433816	and all that good stuff.
2433816	2439644	We'll try to analyze things on the spot best we can and try to yeah, talk about all that good stuff on Thursday night.
2439644	2443450	So I hope you'll join us here at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
2445626	2453112	Real quick comment from Mike Deft saying, speaking of Overwatch, after the conference they gave at Blizzcon, I bought Moira's Lilith skin with a battle pass.
2453112	2456154	I'm sorry, but they definitely sweet-talked me with all those promises.
2456154	2457795	I just hope they actually keep them.
2457795	2459857	As much as I love that skin, I did not buy it.
2459857	2462879	I've actually been playing more Overwatch than I talk about on this show.
2462879	2467543	I have a friend that's really into it and likes me to play with him, so he asked somebody to play.
2467543	2473207	So I got a play of the game this week with Junkrat, and it wasn't even a Riptire play.
2473607	2476349	It's like the first time in a long time I've gotten to play other games.
2476349	2477370	That made me feel really good.
2477370	2479292	But yeah, I've been playing a little bit of Overwatch.
2479292	2480633	I love me a support hero.
2480633	2485196	My favorite heroes in the game right now are probably like Life Weaver is fucking great.
2485196	2487418	And Batiste, I love playing Batiste.
2487418	2489320	His heals are so good.
2489320	2495484	And ever since I learned how to do the super jump so you can like launch in the air and then drop the heal bombs on people, I love it.
2495484	2497906	Like, yeah, Batiste is like probably my favorite hero to play right now.
2497906	2500629	So but yeah, lots of lots of fun in that game.
2501269	2504623	Alright, let's get into some other gaming news.
2504623	2507093	We'll go over to Loki to start us off tonight.
2508055	2515601	Yes, before we get into gaming news, I was going to say, I hope that this year for the Game Awards, they have better security for state on stage.
2515601	2522006	So that douchebag that like interrupted, you know, the whole thing isn't on there again.
2522006	2524988	I'm pretty sure Keeley's been asked about this multiple times.
2524988	2528030	And yes, there will be enhanced security at the Game Awards this year.
2528030	2530973	Especially remember, same shit happened at Gamescom too.
2531893	2534316	All right, let's talk about some good that EA is doing.
2553032	2554153	That feels weird.
2554153	2568468	Anyways, so EA has one of the things that EA does do that gets overshadowed by all the crappy things that EA does is that they have a lot of patents that they develop for accessibility features.
2569448	2576991	and they then make them available for other developers to use because it's just helping the gaming industry.
2576991	2590197	So the latest of this is actually Iris, a photosensitivity tool that automatically analyzes and identifies specific frames that could trigger an epileptic episode for folks.
2590197	2591638	As they have
2593214	2607413	As outlined by UK's Epilepsy Society and the US's Epilepsy Foundation, about 5 people on the globe have epilepsy and are photosensitive, so this basically allows them to develop games
2608174	2613660	that don't have, I guess, cutscenes or gameplay that would trigger this type of thing.
2613660	2622528	They can kind of run this analysis through Iris and be able to tweak stuff so that it would be as safe as possible.
2622528	2625651	So that is pretty awesome.
2625651	2628174	So yeah, they've made it available and that's great.
2629281	2632466	So hopefully we'll see that implemented into other games.
2632466	2637294	So far, they said that it's been used in some of the EA games, including Madden 24, FC 24, and WRC.
2641158	2641878	Yeah, that's great.
2641878	2647539	No, making these types of accessibility things open is a good thing for the gaming industry.
2647539	2651300	So, yeah, no hate on EA for this one.
2651300	2658181	In fact, I wish more companies would do this sort of thing and openly collaborate across the industry for these types of things.
2658181	2660302	I think that that would be a great thing.
2660302	2664582	Or even... At the end of the day, people move around the industry and end up at different companies and stuff.
2664582	2666843	And this is just a good thing to make our industry better.
2667563	2680431	or even just not necessarily just, you know, accessibility patents that could be opened up, like Namco could be non-douchebags and open up, you know, the whole allowing people to play minigames while the game is loading.
2680431	2687535	I mean, granted, load times are like nothing nowadays, but, you know, who doesn't like a good minigame while things are processing and stuff?
2688914	2695021	And Mish in our chat says, I'm so glad because I have non-epileptic seizures and this helps a lot.
2695021	2701188	So these types of things do help people, you know, and games are for everyone.
2701188	2703791	So the more people we can bring to the table, the better.
2703791	2704411	So, yeah.
2705633	2710737	DarkTetsuya does say, to correct you Loki, that that patent did expire.
2710737	2713499	So that no longer is a patent they can have.
2713499	2720344	But I think you are ultimately right that now that we have solid state drives and all the consoles, you don't really have time for games on loading screens anymore anyway.
2720344	2721765	So that's true.
2721765	2723747	The problem kind of fixed itself in that regard.
2725939	2728861	But don't worry, Loki, I do have something to reset the palette.
2728861	2731202	I do have a story about EA being terrible.
2731202	2731863	Allegedly.
2731863	2737787	Now, I am going to preface this with saying it's a Reddit post, and does that mean it's actually news?
2737787	2748013	Arguable, but since we do sometimes, especially on Slow News Week, talk about things that people are talking about on social media a lot too, and this is something that is getting shared a lot.
2748013	2749935	So I am going to bring it up here, and this is
2751035	2759600	Somebody who allegedly had their EA account banned for a Steam purchase, writing on a Reddit post in the Steam Deck Reddit.
2759600	2765164	Hi, I'm posting this out of my own curiosity and kind of warning other members that might want to purchase an EA game.
2765164	2770827	My only gaming platform is the Steam Deck, and I wanted also to play some games with my girlfriend here and there.
2770827	2774209	I purchased on Steam Store the co-op game It Takes Two.
2774209	2775430	That's my only EA game.
2776010	2784896	A week later after beating the game, I got a mail from EA support about permanently banning my account for violating user agreements in terms of sale, whatever that might be.
2784896	2794083	I contacted support and their response, which was a second photo that basically said, tough shit, did not provide any concrete reason behind the action.
2794083	2796865	Did anyone else experience similar experiences?
2796865	2799507	Could it have some conflicting nature with Steam Deck being the platform?
2800757	2803481	So this has a lot of people talking about, God, EA's terrible.
2803481	2806604	Don't buy EA games on Steam, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2806604	2810970	Uh, I, now my first instinct was like, is this isolated?
2810970	2817378	Because I, you know, if it's just one person, we're kind of taking this person at their word that they didn't do anything wrong.
2817538	2818058	Thanks for watching!
2841050	2857713	One of the other thoughts that kind of jumped in my mind, and I think this is worth considering, because I remember, and it's all documented on this show because this show is so fucking old, but back when my Xbox 360 was my primary system of choice, you may recall my Xbox Live account got hacked.
2858514	2871518	and somebody in another country used it to buy a bunch of those fucking FIFA packs and whatever FIFA release was out that year, FIFA 2008 or whatever this happened, like they bought a bunch of FIFA packs in one of those Xbox 360 games.
2871518	2882361	So my thought was, if this person was new to EA and just created an EA account, did their account actually get hacked and was used by somebody else to do something nefarious and they don't realize it?
2882361	2883822	And that's why their account got banned.
2885343	2888266	I think it's an option worth considering here.
2888266	2903457	Possibly, but considering based off of the description in the email, it sounds like they created the account, played the game, and then it got banned shortly after finishing the game or whatever, which wouldn't be a long period of time.
2903457	2905859	That's a short window for someone to hack their account.
2907290	2907851	I don't know.
2907851	2910012	I thought maybe I thought they said it was a week later.
2910012	2910293	Hold on.
2910293	2910693	I'm going.
2910693	2910973	I'm going.
2910973	2914136	That's still a very short period of time.
2914136	2914837	No, it is.
2914837	2923264	But, you know, if they if they made an EA account and they were like, I'm just going to I'm not I'm just going to use a shitty password because I don't want an EA account, blah, blah, blah.
2923264	2929910	And they use like a password that already is on dark web from somewhere else that they didn't really care what password they were using.
2929910	2931431	Maybe somebody was able to get it.
2931431	2932212	I just I just want to
2932692	2933653	Ehh, yeah, possibly
2951650	2955293	Oh, that would explain why EA thinks they're right in banning them.
2955293	2957514	And this guy doesn't understand what the hell happened.
2957514	2962077	I will say where EA sucks and where a lot of companies suck in this regard.
2962077	2963839	And this is what I will agree with.
2963839	2968802	And what does need to change is that they're not giving specific reasons as to why people got banned.
2968802	2969202	Yeah.
2969202	2976567	I don't agree with our terms of sale or, or, and due to what terms of sale, you need to be more specific.
2976567	2977348	You need details.
2978629	2979590	Here's what's next!
2995948	2996229	DarkSakura
3012182	3029969	Once again, you know, if the sir, if, if the experience that you get through piracy is better than the experience provided by doing the right thing and making the purchase through the, you know, the proper channels and paying for everything, then you're advocating piracy.
3029969	3032550	We love a theme.
3032550	3033651	We love a theme.
3033651	3038973	All right, DarkSakura, why don't you update us with a theme in another popular game?
3041895	3044896	Well, the game Fortnite.
3044896	3048138	It likes to do this kind of thing.
3048138	3054000	There is an event that happened in-game.
3054000	3056581	It was called the Big Bang Event.
3056581	3061043	It lasted around 10 minutes and it put people all the way through different spots.
3061923	3077368	But it had everyone gathered on the OG Island to watch some different things in the past happen, like a rocket launch, a meteor crash, and everything going into a black hole.
3077368	3086571	And then you go through all these portals, and like Lego figures, and then all these other things happening, and then finally Eminem appears.
3086571	3090973	And he does Lose Yourself, and you had to hit the notes in time to the music,
3091929	3096612	very Guitar Hero-like.
3096612	3104817	And then, basically, he also turned into a kaiju and did Godzilla.
3104817	3109320	But it was like a big virtual performance.
3109320	3115924	So he was the most recent to do an in-game performance in Fortnite.
3117048	3124751	So yeah, the end of season stuff's always amazing, which is funny because like I don't play the game, but like it sounds cool.
3124751	3132354	Like when you describe like all this pop culture stuff coming together, like they have The Rock playing one of the characters at one point.
3132354	3137595	And it's just it's nuts.
3137595	3140557	Yeah, it sounds like it seems like Fortnite is trying to do a lot of weird stuff.
3140557	3140657	Yeah.
3145341	3152225	I kind of like when Fortnite does these things that aren't just about Battle Royale, you know, that does these.
3152225	3152445	Yeah.
3152445	3156847	And SJ100 Matt points out, apparently The Weeknd is doing one next week.
3156847	3161510	It's only good if Daniel Craig is there to introduce him.
3161510	3166914	Ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd.
3166914	3167194	Anyway.
3169116	3177979	Yeah, TigerClaw points out they revealed some characters that will appear in Chapter 5 and T-SUM as well, and I've seen that discussion going on in our Discord server over at VOGNetwork.com slash Discord.
3177979	3178839	Yeah.
3178839	3185941	So because I think I think there's like a Ninja Turtles character that TigerClaw is of course very excited about and you know some of that stuff.
3185941	3187822	There's like literally everything like it's
3188402	3189402	Family Guy, right?
3189402	3190042	Yeah.
3190042	3195324	It's so funny because Fortnite is almost ending up being like the Oasis from Ready Player One.
3195324	3197504	It's like literally everything.
3197504	3198245	I never thought of it that way.
3198245	3198925	Altogether.
3198925	3200425	Yeah.
3200425	3209708	It's kind of like kind of crazy that they get all these licensee, but it's a massive property that I have no interest in playing, but it looks fun.
3209708	3214109	Like I probably would have fun if I played it, but I'm not going to.
3214109	3214909	Yeah.
3216730	3224795	All right, well, let's move on and talk about this story.
3224795	3230038	I mean, we talk about how like monetization is getting ridiculous with different things.
3230038	3237742	And of course, now we're talking about Street Fighter 6 and the prices that Capcom are trying to charge for skins.
3237742	3241385	Remember back in the day when you could buy a skin pack and it was like,
3242861	3246764	$15 and that was expensive and you got like lots of skins.
3246764	3250067	Now they're trying to charge for outfit pack three.
3250067	3253750	I guess it's skins for each of the different characters.
3253750	3259073	It's going to cost you $100 in total if you were to purchase them.
3259073	3267860	It's 18 different skins and they, the way you have it, it says if you want all 18 outfits, you're going to have to spend over $60.
3270126	3278473	If you have 0 fighter coins, you have to buy 2 packs of $5 sets for 250 coins for a single outfit.
3278473	3297209	So basically, they do the whole HotDogHotDogBung thing with the monetization where you can buy packs of a certain amount of coins but everything costs just a little bit more than that so you have to buy multiple packs of that and you have some left over which is supposed to trigger your
3298030	3300813	You know, mine to go, oh, I got to spend this now.
3300813	3302175	It's just going to be sitting there rotting.
3302175	3304897	I've wasted my money, you know, and I have to go buy something else.
3304897	3306319	You know, that nonsense.
3306319	3309903	They try to manipulate people into purchasing things they don't want.
3311943	3313544	So yeah, they're expensive.
3313544	3315525	Don't buy them if you don't want them.
3315525	3317447	I mean, same goes with like Overwatch 2.
3317447	3320388	We've talked about that where some skins are like 20 bucks.
3320388	3322050	It's like ridiculous.
3322050	3323370	And Destiny 2.
3323370	3327113	I mean, they've had like different cosmetics.
3327113	3331336	I can never forget the Angry Joe show and Joe Vargas talking about
3332761	3336985	They're charging $20 for blue, or maybe that was Fallout 76.
3336985	3337485	One of them.
3337485	3338146	It doesn't matter.
3338146	3340888	You know why it's so easy to get confused of which game it was?
3340888	3342349	Because they all do it.
3342349	3345052	And so, it's just one of those things.
3345052	3348755	Don't support this type of behavior, and they'll stop doing this type of thing.
3348755	3351778	If no one buys it, then no one's... they're not gonna do it.
3351778	3354240	But the problem is, they don't need everyone to buy it.
3354240	3356882	They just need their whales to buy it, and that's why they do it.
3358413	3359334	It's annoying.
3359334	3360655	Good point.
3360655	3365499	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, remember back in the day when you just unlocked extra skins by playing the game a lot?
3365499	3366559	Seriously?
3366559	3371003	Yeah, and palette swaps were just hitting a different button to select your character.
3371003	3374826	Or it could be even a different skin.
3374826	3378168	You could just switch between the skins and stuff.
3378168	3382171	It's so dumb that they figured out that they can monetize everything and so they do.
3383112	3390578	I mean, it started way back in the day with EA charging for cheat codes on the Xbox 360 that you could get for free on the PlayStation 2.
3390578	3393981	The beginning of the end.
3393981	3403509	They're testing the waters with stuff and seeing what they can get away with and then pushing the envelope even more until people, you know, complain about it and there's a big backlash.
3403729	3406912	and they bring it back and they slowly inch towards that again.
3406912	3420463	Or, there's the option, I forget what the actual phrase for this is, but basically where they propose something absolutely ridiculously evil and then walk it back to something less evil, but that's really what they wanted in the first place.
3420463	3425367	You know, instead of saying, I'm gonna kill all the puppies, I'm just gonna kill one of the puppies.
3425367	3427269	And you're like, well, I guess that's... I don't like that analogy.
3427269	3429811	It's not as bad as killing all the puppies, but, you know.
3430796	3431521	It's the trolley problem.
3431521	3432912	I only wanted to kill one poppy.
3432912	3433738	It's the trolley problem.
3435538	3440281	TigerClawChat says, speaking of Fallout, have you seen the trailer for the live action series?
3440281	3441381	Actually, no, I haven't.
3441381	3442262	I'm excited.
3442262	3442722	It looks awesome.
3442722	3443983	I've heard it looks pretty good.
3443983	3444343	I have to.
3444343	3445964	I'm not super into Fallout.
3445964	3446585	I'm sorry.
3446585	3447545	I know I'm not.
3447545	3452088	I'm not like the other gamers, but if it was if it was Elder Scrolls.
3452088	3453549	It's just the world.
3453549	3454450	I'd check it out.
3454450	3455010	Yeah.
3455010	3457652	I mean, maybe and maybe it'll land better for me as a TV show.
3457652	3458512	I should check it out.
3458512	3459373	I really should.
3459373	3462015	So just watch the trailer and see if it hits some of the.
3464045	3466489	E3VL says surprised it's on Amazon Prime Video instead of Paramount like Halo
3478188	3489231	Well, they bought the rights to it a long time ago, so it's not... And I mean, was it the... We're still waiting for... Remember, there's the Bioshock show that's gonna be coming to Netflix, I think.
3489231	3497314	There was a Final Fantasy XIV show that was supposed to happen at some point, too, and you know I'm excited about that, but it seems to be... It's... It's... Gamer's eating good.
3497314	3497814	Yeah.
3497814	3497994	Yeah.
3499825	3513654	Moving on, let's talk about the game Atari 50, which was a pretty cool little retro collection that was released earlier this year, I think it was this year, by Digital Eclipse, who Atari actually happens to now own.
3513654	3521640	And I don't know if it's as a result of that or what, but as part of this, Atari 50 is getting more games with a free update.
3522240	3530505	Essentially, it's DLC, but not in the traditional sense of like paying for it because it's actually just a patch that's it's gonna but it's gonna feel like DLC, I guess.
3530505	3536148	And maybe a good counterpoint to what Loki was just talking about.
3536148	3546373	Here's here's a nice way where the digital stuff has actually enhanced a game because Atari 50 is getting an update with 12 new games in it that's coming out next week for the price of free.
3546733	3547133	December 5th, 2023
3569361	3578349	Speaking of the whole Atari and Digital Eclipse thing, it should also be pointed out, reminded, that this week we also find out what Digital Eclipse is doing for their next Gold Master series.
3578349	3588839	And again, I think a lot of people slept on the making of Karateka, which is really the same engine as Atari 50, but when they focus solely on one game, they really go in-depth with this.
3588839	3592703	And they're going to be doing it for another game, so we're going to find out what that game is this week.
3592703	3594785	And, you know, some people kind of go with the
3595325	3601528	obvious choice of Prince of Persia which would be Jordan Mechner's kind of next big game would be a good one for that.
3601528	3623117	I've been a little bit, I suggested Wolfenstein 3D as the game and the reason why is because for some reason one of the people that worked with that game was interviewed in the material for the Karateka, making of Karateka and I was like that, I mean the guy from Mortal Kombat I can see that one a little bit and I don't see Warner Brothers playing nice with anyone at all at this point but
3624378	3626665	Why is the guy from Wolfenstein 3D in there?
3626665	3629754	Maybe they had him comment on it while they were interviewing him for something else.
3630652	3642355	So that's, and I think that would be a very interesting, you know, because that particular game was the start of like a 3D revolution of sorts on PC and shareware.
3642355	3647997	I think there's so much they could do with that game and talking about the impact of shareware in that era.
3647997	3655939	And I think there's a lot of younger gamers today, God, I sound like an old man, but it's true, that don't like know what shareware was all about.
3656619	3680394	when there was amazing so much of us like live that like we played the shit out of Commander Keen gotcha mon fake mods yeah you know yeah exactly so i i think that would be such an interesting title um and all the mods people did for that and of course you got things like spear of destiny that came out after that i think that would be such an interesting title but we'll see we'll see i realize i'm reaching so we'll see we'll see what happens with that uh later up this week
3680934	3684737	So yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'm getting whatever they make.
3684737	3685757	They won me over.
3685757	3687458	And honestly, same.
3687458	3702068	I I wasn't even a big fan of Karate Cup, but I thought that the the museum that they put together was so good in that that honestly, if whatever they do is as good preserved as that, it's it's going to be great.
3702068	3704050	So, yeah.
3704050	3705250	All right.
3705250	3710534	Let's move on to other moments in gaming history, perhaps DarkSakura.
3712416	3722366	So, there's times when people own their own business that someone might shutter the business, but, you know, keep paying the rent for the storage.
3724004	3730308	We know that there were mom and pop video rental stores.
3730308	3742194	There was a store in Nebraska that was a video game store that closed in 1998 and the inventory was put into storage.
3743055	3756709	Well, what they found after opening it last year is 173 items in there that they've had appraised, plus others that haven't been looked at yet.
3756709	3763517	So, like, I'm looking at an entire box on one of these of Blackthorn, which honestly, no great loss.
3763997	3767039	But, you know, there's other games in there.
3767039	3770522	I mean, we thought it would just come back and sell them at some point.
3770522	3773384	And they are now pretty vintage.
3773384	3775746	So.
3775746	3779168	The.
3779168	3791917	Now, some of this is, I think, someone who doesn't actually really know the value of some of the games, because like it's like had a sealed copy of Chrono Trigger and like some people will pay ten thousand dollars.
3791917	3792277	No, they won't.
3795021	3800484	I mean, some people might, but I don't think Chrono Trigger would fetch that, you know.
3800484	3807888	But he's thinking that selling off the whole collection would bring him in, you know, six figures.
3807888	3810590	I don't think so.
3810590	3820515	But he's going to be... They've called the collection now the Nebraska Collection, and the games in there will not be sold individually.
3820515	3822717	He's going to try to sell them all.
3824014	3839367	Uh, all at once, which again, I don't think, I mean, if someone does it, they've got more money than sense, but I'm trying to see if, if it was posted anywhere, like what the actual list of, of the games.
3839367	3844231	And I don't, I don't see the list.
3844231	3847894	And, you know, if you think about it with it being a store from 1998,
3851579	3857224	then think about what would have been out at that time as a new game.
3857224	3865032	Or even just in the past, I would say, 8 months before that if they were keeping their stock up to date.
3868181	3875048	Yeah, the the annoying thing is that I'm trying to see if there is a list of what's actually in the collection.
3875048	3876790	Right around that year, it wasn't linked.
3876790	3883856	You should have Black Lion Final Fantasy 7 and was Castlevania Symphony of the Night 98 or 99?
3883856	3887140	But you might have some some Black Lion PlayStation games around that time, too.
3887140	3888141	That was after.
3888141	3890703	Some of those that came out like the year I moved out.
3890703	3891124	So I think 99.
3891124	3891264	OK, OK.
3893925	3897168	So yeah, because Dan had the import copy when I moved out here.
3897168	3899769	Mm hmm.
3899769	3911138	Even still, some of those old, but I mean, still some of those old school PlayStation package games like back before they they had the big like rectangular cases, some of those still fetch a bit of money just because those cases are so rare.
3911138	3913100	So, oh, SJ100mat links a video.
3913100	3915421	Well, and thank you for the YouTube link.
3915421	3919304	I'm looking, trying to find something text based because, you know, live show.
3919304	3921626	Yeah.
3921626	3921946	But
3923982	3926524	And now like everything's completely locked up on me.
3926524	3927485	That's right.
3927485	3932809	Um, but yeah, I think it's gonna be interesting that this guy probably does make a little bit of money off of this.
3932809	3934190	Probably not as much as he thinks.
3934190	3948460	I think all of that, you know, that Super Mario Brothers original cart auction fuckery that happened, which I believe was shown to be that it was a whole scheme to inflate the value of that type of stuff in the first place, may have given this guy a bad perception.
3948460	3948741	But like,
3949381	3954645	If he does have a sealed copy of Stadium Events, I mean, yeah, he's going to get money for that.
3954645	3957007	And even, you know, he probably could.
3957007	3959069	This is so stupid.
3959069	3961891	A sealed chrono trigger is still going to be worth a bit.
3961891	3963833	I don't know about $10,000, but it'll be worth a bit of money.
3963833	3975582	No, looking at the page for the Nebraska collection and each of them had a placeholder amount of a million dollars on them.
3976678	3978179	I'm like, really?
3978179	3989623	So I'm looking at the games, we have ActRaiser 2, which would get money, Arrow the Acrobat, there's an Afterburner 32X, Alien 3, eh.
3989623	3991944	Alien vs. Predator, eh.
3991944	3996346	There's Arcana, I'm looking for things that I think would actually have been like
3997086	4013503	Worth Something, Sealed Battletoads for Genesis, Breath of Fire 2 with the crappy American artwork, the Dracula game was terrible.
4013503	4015546	I mean, there's a few things on here.
4015546	4017848	Brain Lord, actually.
4017848	4018589	That one's kind of...
4022119	4025103	But so far, I mean, there's a chrono trigger.
4025103	4028648	I think that would get money.
4028648	4033534	And honestly, the games that are on here that I would want, I have.
4037728	4043231	I'm just looking through, and a lot of them I have sealed as well.
4043231	4049293	But the thing is that they've got these placeholders on them so that they can show what the games are.
4049293	4051174	They're going to be sold en masse.
4051174	4055696	So there's an Eternal Champions, there's a Final Fantasy III.
4055696	4057576	Again, I'm looking for notable, you know.
4060345	4063570	WowLotus2's Sega Collection.
4063570	4064512	Bunch of Madden!
4065495	4066255	Whoop-de-shit!
4093103	4096204	Alright, let's move on, Loki!
4097699	4102783	Alright, so this is quite the blunder, and I think it's pretty funny.
4102783	4120237	So Ubisoft has been in a panic because they accidentally uploaded Beyond Good and Evil Remaster, a game that has not been announced, to their Ubisoft Plus subscribers.
4120237	4124681	And folks were able to download it and play the game, but now they're trying to walk back
4125640	4131321	The leak saying, oh, hold on, you know, but then eventually they came out and said, OK, fine.
4131321	4134082	I guess Cat's out of bag.
4134082	4136743	Beyond Good and Evil is coming out.
4136743	4140944	The remaster for the 20th anniversary next year.
4140944	4147485	But I think I think it's hilarious when they tried to, you know.
4147485	4151006	Delist it really quickly in a panic, but yeah, it's all messed up.
4153257	4160012	It's gonna have a 4K visuals and 60fps gameplay with improved graphics controls and audio.
4160012	4162497	I mean, typically what you expect with a remaster.
4163817	4170582	This is kind of a weird thing to be hiding in December, but then I'm kind of like, oh, maybe this was something for the Game Awards.
4170582	4172583	It was probably the Game Awards announcement.
4172583	4174304	Probably something they were going to unveil.
4174304	4174845	Whoops.
4174845	4176466	Yeah.
4176466	4176946	Yeah.
4176946	4177446	Whoops.
4177446	4180268	Well, and to be fair, we'll probably still see it there.
4180268	4180709	I don't see it.
4180709	4184051	They're going to like pull the trigger because the thing that didn't leak is the footage.
4184051	4188034	So they'll still want to show that 4K 60 frames a second and all that stuff, the footage.
4188034	4192737	But I think for the most part, it's just to remind people that Beyond Good and Evil is in fact a franchise.
4193417	4212851	uh even though we haven't seen anything new from it for um god a decade uh even though we were promised something but we know how that you know how that goes you know how good developments and the game yeah and the one that was a leaked out wasn't the the final game either it was a development version that was leaked out so whoops whoops
4215985	4216905	Well, we'll see.
4216905	4222167	This could be one of those safe bets for things you're going to see at the Game Awards.
4222167	4229610	Lastly, but not leastly, as we're going into the Game Awards this week, you know, there's been a lot of talk about what a great year it's been for video games.
4229610	4239154	But I have to say, actually, if you haven't seen the video with Ben Starr that's floating around on social media right now, he did a really good job kind of summarizing how
4239654	4244780	It's a great year for video games, but it's not a great year for the industry.
4244780	4252728	You know, as we've also kind of been talking about is that there's been a lot of layoffs and stuff.
4252728	4253709	And this week is no different.
4253709	4256752	I actually am stalling because I actually wanted to play this for you.
4256752	4259395	I think you did such a good job putting this together.
4259395	4260456	Let me actually
4261297	4262680	Would you say 2023 is the best year for video games?
4270942	4272643	Honestly, are we going to get serious?
4272643	4276966	I think, yes, it is an amazing year for video games to come out.
4276966	4281029	I think it's not a great year for video games insofar as all of the layoffs.
4281029	4285813	I think it's not great for that and I think that does need to be spoken about at an event like this.
4285813	4292758	I think we want to celebrate all of these games but maybe there is something missing because a lot of people who made those games are no longer working at those companies.
4293058	4295059	And I think that also has to be respected.
4295059	4302022	So yeah, 2023 is an astonishing year for the video games that have been made, but not necessarily for the industry that it reflects.
4302022	4304062	And so I think that's a shame.
4304062	4306443	And hopefully, this is the worst that it gets.
4306443	4308404	I fear that it isn't.
4308404	4320469	But I really hope that, you know, we, the industry figures out a way of course correcting and allowing those people who've made these games that we are celebrating today, to celebrate them as well and not be on, you know, the unemployment line.
4321429	4340339	I think he did such a good job putting that out there and really being respectful of the award ceremony that he was attending but you know saying that we're here to celebrate this today but we need to find a way to kind of stop laying people off with all this thing so sorry I know that was a bit long of a clip but I had to play that and
4340999	4351288	I love that orange suit that he's wearing, but he does wear it a little high-waisted like he's going to go play golf after, but I still am very jealous of that orange velvet that he's wearing in that scene.
4351288	4358313	Anyway, unfortunately, that all leads into me talking about, unfortunately, another layoff story.
4358313	4364058	This one's from Unity, and so you kind of go, well, Unity didn't have the greatest year.
4365459	4369040	At least the CEO took a hit.
4369040	4372560	Usually with these stories, somehow the CEO is never held accountable.
4372560	4375801	In this particular case, Unity's CEO was held accountable.
4375801	4389844	But Unity will be laying off 265 employees, specifically though at Weta Digital, which was part of the acquisition of the VFX business, because Unity is now going to step away from this to focus on their core business,
4390464	4393546	I wonder why their core business needs to be focused on.
4393546	4398229	So I think some of this does play into what has happened as you saw earlier.
4398229	4402572	This would be 3.8% of the total workforce for Unity.
4402572	4406314	This was Peter Jackson's original company there.
4406314	4410937	The pipeline technology and engineering talent, the deal was worth $1.652 billion when it happened.
4419062	4426547	Unity believes the Weta Digital team are remarkable, but Unity needs to become leaner as it focuses its expertise on its core business.
4426547	4432450	It also believes it will make more sense for WetaFX to own full end-to-end production activities directly.
4432450	4443337	Unity will be focusing its expertise and people on other matters, and WetaFX will be getting support for its use of the Weta tools directly from its own crew, a shorter path which makes sense for both companies.
4443777	4465597	so um that's a bunch of bunch of speak there i i don't know like then why did you buy it in the first place like like that was kind of a tacky decision to just do i hate it when companies buy other companies and lay everybody off well because i think that they're they were hoping that their their engine was going to be more so
4467151	4472915	Like what we saw with the Matrix, that whole Matrix simulation thing we had in the Unity 5 demo.
4472915	4474576	Well, sort of.
4474576	4475317	That was Unreal.
4475317	4477358	Oh, I get them all mixed up, sorry.
4477358	4478899	No, no, no, that's fair enough.
4478899	4488065	And actually, to that point, like, so Unreal 5, for example, has actually been used in TV shows to generate, it could be sets or whatever.
4488065	4496811	Like one modern example of that actually is, so Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips has a channel called
4499373	4502116	Oh, it's a game quickie or something like that.
4502116	4507782	And the set that they use in that is actually a virtual set that they created in Unreal 5.
4507782	4514489	And so there's actually other productions that are using that as like a way to, you know, produce video.
4514489	4517612	Like they can do movies and animation, all sorts of stuff in that.
4518232	4521013	Unity was setting themselves up to be kind of like that.
4521013	4528515	In fact, there were many tech demos or movies that they would be putting out to try to push it in that direction.
4528515	4534836	I don't know if they ever got to that point and if people were really using the software like that.
4534836	4536437	So it's just...
4538460	4542425	I guess that what didn't work out as well for them as they had hoped.
4542425	4551195	Which makes sense because, I mean, like, one of the things that Unity tries to push to with their software is the utilization of, like, monetization and ads and stuff like that.
4551195	4553999	You can't really do that with movie production.
4553999	4554980	So, I don't know.
4557268	4558128	All right.
4558128	4568273	Well, let's let's let's travel back to a simpler time when games were just games, even though we may have a little bit of a twist tonight, but I'm going to run the bumper all the same.
4578945	4586708	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4586708	4590049	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4590049	4598072	But in our twist for this year, once a month, DarkSakura picks a non-video game to spotlight in this segment.
4598072	4602754	DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for the classic non-video game?
4602754	4604394	I actually picked this for you, Rob.
4604394	4605375	I thought it might be.
4607125	4614551	I picked Cluedo, as it is known everywhere else in the world except North America, where here it is called Clue.
4614551	4629123	It is a murder mystery game for three to six players, and it was created, or I'd say conceptualized, in 1943 by a British board game designer called Anthony E. Pratt.
4629944	4644369	It was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the UK in 1949, and since then it's been relaunched, it has been updated, modernized, and is now owned by Hasbro here in the US.
4644369	4649911	So basically, the purpose of the game is to figure out who the victim is,
4650871	4654513	where the crime took place and which weapon was used.
4654513	4666601	And so you assume the role of one of the suspects and try to figure out how by moving around the game board and, you know, collecting the clues to see who it was.
4666601	4670243	And oh, has this game explodedodeded.
4672004	4676247	It's had spinoffs, movies, games.
4676247	4682651	So, I'm going to go a little bit into some of the history of this game.
4682651	4695660	So basically, Pratt, who was a musician and a factory worker, was stuck in home during the air raids in Birmingham, England, during World War II.
4697001	4706127	And he was thinking about these murder mystery games that some of his clients would have.
4706127	4713732	And how exactly how popular detective fiction was, including Agatha Christie.
4713732	4722859	So he put out a patent in 1944 for his invention of a murder mystery game originally called Murder with an exclamation point.
4722859	4724220	Would you have played a game called Murder?
4725679	4729940	Um, I mean, there was a game called 13 Dead End Drive, and I did play that.
4729940	4735821	So sure, sure, I'd play a game called Murder, as long as it wasn't like Murder Me.
4735821	4754645	Well, at any rate, Pratt and his wife, Elva, who she had helped design the game, brought it to the executive at Waddington's, Norman Watson, who bought it on site and provided the name Cluedo.
4756013	4764135	which is a variation, of course, on the word clue and Ludo, which is the Latin word for I play.
4764135	4771456	And it was also the name of a game that was based off of Pachizi.
4771456	4780458	At any rate, the design of the house was said to be based on the Tudor Clothes Hotel in Roddingdeen.
4781758	4783639	Murder at Tudor Close
4797126	4805850	shortages of materials that prevented the official launch until 1949 where it was licensed to Parker Brothers in the U.S.
4805850	4809511	and was renamed Clue because people in the U.S.
4809511	4810952	didn't know what Ludo was.
4810952	4818455	And we wouldn't know the name Ludo until the NeverEnding Story and then a band named themselves after the character.
4818455	4818695	Anyway.
4820556	4826778	So, some of the differences from the original concept and the one published in 1949.
4826778	4834502	Pratt's design called for ten characters, with one designated to be the victim by random drawing.
4834502	4838624	The characters eliminated were Mr. Brown, Mr. Gold, Ms.
4838624	4840805	Gray, and Mrs. Silver.
4840805	4846748	There was the character of Nurse White and Colonel Yellow were renamed to Mrs. White and Colonel Mustard.
4848909	4856614	And then you could play up to the eight remaining characters, add up to nine suspects.
4856614	4861557	Originally there were 11 rooms, including a room called the Gun Room and the Cellar.
4861557	4864539	And there were originally nine weapons.
4864539	4871143	Some of the ones not used were a bomb, a syringe, a shillelagh.
4871143	4872224	You know what a shillelagh is, right?
4873044	4875447	I'm sorry, a bomb?
4875447	4876067	A bomb.
4876067	4878750	Wouldn't that kind of also blow up the house?
4878750	4880872	I'm glad they cut that one.
4880872	4885257	Yeah, and it could be like a localized, like a little pipe bomb or something.
4885257	4889581	But the Shillelagh is what the Blight carries, his cudgel walking stick.
4891656	4896338	There was a fireplace poker and later on an axe and poison.
4896338	4901060	Some of these did appear in spin-off versions of the game.
4901060	4910884	The gameplay was a little bit different too, so the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved rather than dealt to players.
4911704	4919216	and that you had to land on another player in order to make a suggestion about their character with the use of tokens.
4919216	4922121	And once you're out of tokens, you could no longer make the suggestions.
4925142	4933067	Some were left unchanged for the standard classic detective editions, and some were changed later.
4933067	4942913	Some of the methodology for the game was similar to an American card game called The King of Hearts Has Five Sons, which is a game I'm not familiar with.
4943833	4953521	But it was really a game that would get people together and have a little mystery on a cold night.
4953521	4960807	As far as its marketing, it was called the Great New Detective Game and it's launched in North America.
4964278	4976447	They also were trying to get the license for the great new Sherlock Holmes game from the Doyle estate, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
4976447	4981792	And so it was really marketed as the great detective game and the Parker Brothers detective game.
4983213	4988998	The launch of the 1972 edition, which for those who are watching live is what we are seeing.
4988998	4995504	And this is honestly the version I grew up playing because all my friends had the old copy of the game.
4995504	4995904	Same.
4995904	5000528	Actually, we actually had this version at home until I got Master Detective, although I'm sure that's coming up later.
5000528	5003611	But yes, I also had this version.
5003611	5003731	Mm hmm.
5005109	5016856	Well, basically the commercials in 72, which I've seen these commercials had Holmes and Watson playing a competitive game of Clue.
5016856	5031886	And then later on, like they started having like a guy who was like Inspector Clouseau from the Pink Panther films, you know, and then they now like as of 1986, the slogan went to classic detective game that's persisted all the way up until 2003.
5035738	5036410	But, um...
5037958	5046662	They've had like very famous, you know, fictional detectives feature in some of the marketing, including Sam Spade.
5046662	5059708	So, so in general for the game, your equipment is you have a game board that has your rooms and secret passages in an English country house called Tudor Mansion.
5059708	5067351	It's had other names like Tudor Close, Tudor Hall, Arlington Grange, Body Manor or Body Mansion.
5069032	5090811	In Hampshire, England in 1926, the game has playing pieces to represent the characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards that have the rooms the characters are weapons, solution cards, and an envelope.
5092952	5109001	And so, in some cases it's a mirror, but it includes one card from each set of cards and then the detective's notepads that you can use to keep notes on the game, although we were prohibited by, you know, threat of exile to use those.
5109001	5112603	We all had, we had like little notebooks that were actually in the box.
5113909	5131708	So, in the UK version for your characters, you had Dr. Black, who was the victim, in the US it was Mr. Body, which is now just making me think, I butthole.
5131708	5133510	Talking about Mr. Body's butler.
5133510	5134411	Oh yes, I butthole, sir.
5137167	5144838	In the 2023 version, there's a reference to him as Bodden Body Black Jr.
5146774	5151175	So you either have little pawns or figurines, depending on your version.
5151175	5155476	So you have Miss Scarlet, who is a femme fatale.
5155476	5160158	Colonel Mustard, who is a retired military officer of a distinguished career.
5160158	5167679	Mrs. White, who is the chief domestic servant, as in housekeeper or cook.
5167679	5169240	She's been called Chef White before.
5171821	5180769	In 2016, she was replaced by Dr. Orchid, who was a biologist and adopted daughter of the victim.
5180769	5183231	And then she was replaced by Chef White.
5183231	5197882	So there was Reverend Green, also known as Mayor Green, the clergyman, who was, you know, also called Mr. Green here in the U.S., who is a middle-aged businessman with possible criminal connections.
5198803	5201925	and turned into a handsome playboy.
5201925	5211951	There's Mrs. Peacock, who is a widowed socialite, although in 2023 there was Solicitor Peacock.
5211951	5218835	And then Professor Plum, who is an intelligent, absent-minded professor, or academic of sorts.
5218835	5225359	The weapons that you have are the candlestick, the dagger, the lead pipe, or lead piping as it was in the UK,
5226219	5227581	The Revolver.
5227581	5234571	In the UK, it was originally a Dreyse M1907 semi-automatic pistol.
5234571	5238016	In North America, it was a Colt M1911 pistol.
5238016	5243023	There was the Rope and the Spanner, which in the US was called the Wrench.
5245492	5249535	So, I mean, I'm not going to go into, like, the super gameplay or the super rules.
5249535	5253698	I just wanted to give a little bit of high level on it.
5253698	5259021	But there are advantages to which character that you play.
5259021	5267988	Like, Mrs. Peacock has an immediate advantage of starting one space closer to the first room than any of the other players, if you play by the rules.
5268528	5275973	Professor Plum can move to the study and take a secret passage to the kitchen, which is the hardest room to reach, so he has that.
5275973	5276533	And Ms.
5276533	5281977	Scarlet has the advantage of moving first, in the traditional rules.
5281977	5285519	So, as for the additions, hoo boy!
5287227	5298693	There were unique editions between Parker Brothers and Waddingtons, and then Hasbro bought both versions and, you know, just basically changed the labels for market.
5298693	5306637	There were eight unique editions published in North America, including travel editions, miniature travel editions.
5306637	5312980	Three distinct Cluedo in the UK, the longest, which ran 47 years from its introduction in 1949.
5316892	5330628	The 8th North American and 4th UK editions have a shared design, and the international ones had some of their own unique designs, but most of them drew off of the UK or US ones.
5332490	5342497	In July 2008, Hasbro released a revamped Clue called Clue Discover the Secrets and it offered some major changes.
5342497	5347680	So that was when Dr. Orchid came out and some of the rooms were changed.
5347680	5349822	Of course, I think it went back.
5350662	5356963	So, um... There was also... Okay, so we had Cluedo discover the secrets.
5356963	5360604	We had Clue the classic mystery game.
5360604	5367805	There was Clue master detective with 12 rooms, 10 characters, and 8 weapons for up to 10 players.
5367805	5375467	And they added in Miss Peach, Miss Silbrunette, Madame Rose, and Sergeant Grey to the list of the suspects.
5375467	5377487	It also added poison and a horseshoe.
5378543	5381565	Other rooms added were the Fountain, the Gazebo, and the Carriage House.
5394642	5396344	Yeah.
5396344	5406314	So there was the 50th Anniversary Edition that had a deluxe format with an option to play with an extra murder weapon, which is the bottle of poison.
5406314	5410758	And it was also issued as a miniature version.
5410758	5416084	There was Clue Nostalgia Edition that was basically a reissue of the 1963 game in a wooden box.
5419046	5428408	Um, there was the Vintage Edition, which, uh, was, like, a, it was that bookshelf collection.
5428408	5432749	So, which, we still sometimes see it, uh, TJ Maxx.
5432749	5438791	But, oh, goodness, the game has spawned so many things.
5442033	5456885	We have had Clue VCR Mystery Game from 1985, which is what Rob was referring to, and it became the fourth best-selling videocassette in 1985.
5456885	5460528	Above it were Beverly Hills Cops, Star Trek III, and Ghostbusters.
5462191	5466433	and Games listed it as one of the top 100 games of the year.
5466433	5477918	There was Super Cluedo Challenge, which was an advanced version that had Captain Brown, Miss Peach, and Mr. Slate gray, and the weapons were a Blunderbuss Poison and Axe for extra ones.
5477918	5490623	There was a Clue VCR 2, Murder in Disguise, Clue Master Detective, which was that big copy, Clue Junior, Case of the Missing Pet for children, Travel Clue,
5491323	5498473	Cluedo the Great Museum Caper, Cluedo Card Game, Clue Little Detective, Jr.
5498473	5502738	Cluedo, Travel Clue Jr., Cluedo Super Sleuth, Clue Jr.
5502738	5508245	The Case of the Hidden Toys, Cluedo Passport to Murder, which is just a cool name, I would read that book.
5509022	5524401	Cluedo Card Game, Cluedo SFX, which was released as ClueFX, or Super Cluedo Interactif, which was... was that?
5524401	5526043	That wasn't the SNES one, was it?
5528612	5529132	I don't think so.
5529132	5530753	No, anyway, I don't think so.
5530753	5532494	There was the SNES one.
5532494	5533455	There was Cluedo Jr.
5533455	5536877	The Case of the Missing Cake, which would have been in Matami.
5536877	5544141	Clue Mysteries, Cluedo DVD, Cluedo Party, Clue Express, Cluedo Discover the Secrets, that was released as Clue.
5544141	5546823	Cluedo Carnival, The Case of the Missing Prizes.
5546823	5549945	There's Secrets in Paris, Secrets in Spies.
5549945	5550845	Oh my God, there's so many.
5550845	5552807	Several card games.
5552807	5557409	Clue Elimination, that uses four Nerf Jolt EX-1 Blasters.
5558810	5562915	It was the Classic Mystery, all kinds of... Oh my god, there's just so many of them.
5562915	5565057	I mean, we don't have to go over them all.
5565057	5568180	It's fine.
5568180	5569041	Whose segment is this?
5572085	5573126	Rob, I'm teasing.
5573126	5576809	I wasn't going to go over all of them.
5576809	5579031	OK, so here's where I wanted to get into the video games.
5579031	5596264	So there were video game versions on the Commodore 64, MSX, Atari ST, PC, Game Boy Advance, ZX Spectrum, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Switch, Super Nintendo, CD-i, Sega, Mega Drive, Genesis, PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and on iOS.
5596264	5599967	And many, many more.
5599967	5601028	And then there was the movie.
5601845	5609227	It bombed in the box office, but later on got a massive cult following, and we love it.
5610663	5613544	and there is an upcoming film.
5613544	5623747	This was though announced in 2008 that Hasbro licensed some of their board games to Universal Pictures including Clue.
5623747	5632050	They announced that Ryan Reynolds would be in it and then Jason Bateman and then
5633050	5636054	Lots of people, so it's gone on and on.
5636054	5640218	There have been live Clue game shows and Cluedo game shows.
5640218	5648928	A TV series on The Hub had a five-part miniseries, and I didn't watch this, and now I kind of want to.
5648928	5649749	A documentary.
5650973	5656235	There has been Clue the Musical that ran off Broadway in 1997.
5656235	5658776	Another play, Clue on Stage.
5658776	5664898	The book of Clue, which I have the novelization somewhere in my collection.
5664898	5670340	And if I am right, it had an ending in it that was not in the movie.
5670340	5671220	Just saying.
5671220	5673901	It was comics, jigsaw puzzles.
5673901	5676142	If they could market something about it, they would.
5678159	5688342	And so, yeah, Clue has been listed as one of the top 100 games released ever.
5688342	5696885	It has been licensed in languages, other locations, and given that this is the last of these for the year,
5697905	5708874	I also thought that there are two other games, one of them which Rob mentioned, that are spiritual successors, and that would be 13 Dead End Drive.
5708874	5715038	There's Kill Dr. Lucky, Orient Express, Mystery, and Whodunit.
5715038	5715559	And that's it!
5716980	5717961	All right.
5717961	5728290	There's a heck of a huge game that's had a lot of impact on the industry to wrap up the year of the classic non-video games.
5728290	5730432	Clue?
5730432	5734115	Yes, there is an MSX version, Dark Tetsuya.
5734115	5734575	All right.
5734575	5742902	But this game... It's impossible not to bring up much more with it just because it has such a massive legacy.
5742902	5743763	Yeah, for sure.
5743763	5744023	So...
5745410	5756714	Well, since that was the last special monthly segment of the year, let's take a trip down memory lane and recap, in the archives, every non-video game pick for the year.
5756714	5761755	So, this is the roster of our classic non-video games for 2023.
5761755	5764596	So, in January, we had Mall Madness.
5764596	5765817	February, Jenga.
5767131	5768933	March, we had Simon.
5768933	5770674	April, we had Bop It.
5770674	5772836	May, we had Operation.
5772836	5775178	June, we had Mousetrap.
5775178	5778220	In July, you were caught in the Crossfire.
5778220	5781603	In August, we had Don't Break the Ice.
5781603	5784105	September was Connect Four.
5784105	5786507	October was Mystery Date.
5786507	5789289	Last month, November, was Guess Who?
5789289	5793772	And then December, of course, Clue or Cluedo, if you're in the rest of the world.
5795213	5795673	There it is.
5795673	5799254	So I don't know what I'm doing next.
5799254	5799994	Well, that's OK.
5799994	5800834	It's still early in the month.
5800834	5802475	I forgot what I came up with.
5802475	5805096	It's still early in the month, so we have a long time to figure it out.
5805096	5809817	So we'll... I think I was doing, like, cancelled game of the month.
5809817	5812297	Oh, that could be interesting.
5812297	5821580	Yeah, I want to say that I was going to do a cancelled game of the month because, like, I got on the thought of it by looking at Robotech Crystal Dreams.
5821580	5821760	Mm-hmm.
5823635	5828018	You know, Capcom fighting all-stars in some of those other games.
5828018	5835822	And so I think that that's going to be my theme is cancelled classic video game of the month.
5835822	5837003	That's a good one.
5837003	5845008	Or like even in the future, you could do like classic video game company that's no longer around or something like that.
5845008	5845908	It could be on the list.
5845908	5849590	As opposed to a classic video game or as a cancelled video game, a cancelled company.
5849590	5850351	That could be interesting.
5852433	5856957	I nominate Westwood Studios.
5856957	5861201	One of the games that I would put on this list, technically, I already covered.
5861201	5862502	Two of them, I think.
5862502	5865105	Yeah, because didn't you do Philebus?
5865105	5866946	I did.
5866946	5868468	Well, no, because that wasn't a real game.
5868468	5869448	That was just a rumor.
5869448	5870870	Oh, I thought somebody was actually trying to do it.
5870870	5875654	But for actual classic games, cancelled games, I did Space Fantasy Zone.
5878621	5880722	I like the way OrangeWrite phrases it in chat.
5880722	5884463	What could have been the classic game of the week?
5884463	5885364	I'm down for that.
5885364	5887385	I'm down for that.
5887385	5887785	All right.
5887785	5894068	There may be some repeats that I covered before, but they have their purpose.
5894068	5894448	All right.
5894448	5900250	Well, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other quick headlines for the week.
5900250	5904092	Loki, I think you just have a pair of stories for us, then we'll get to the release dates around the world.
5904625	5906186	Yes, yes, yes.
5906186	5918992	The news I have been waiting for, the confirmation of when we can expect Grand Theft Auto VI's trailer to drop, and that is Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
5918992	5920853	Eastern Standard Time.
5920853	5922234	Or I guess Eastern Time.
5922234	5924775	Which means I'm still asleep here.
5924775	5929317	I'm still asleep, but the first thing I do when I wake up is watching that trailer.
5929317	5929838	Can't wait.
5930925	5943170	And, uh, it's funny is it, you know, there's been already leaks out from the game from allegedly some, uh, Rockstar head developer's, uh, son.
5943170	5949432	Well, it'll be interesting because the trailer should help, you know, either it's going to prove these leaks true or proven false.
5949432	5949932	Oh, no, no.
5949932	5952353	I mean, all the leaks are, the leaks are true.
5952353	5956775	I mean, obviously like we had development gameplay, uh, it's in Vice City.
5956775	5958796	It's, it's absolutely in Vice City.
5958796	5958956	Like,
5959921	5962343	That's not even up to question.
5962343	5964184	So, it'll be interesting to see.
5964184	5970409	I want to see the details of it, because obviously, Red Dead pushed the graphics and everything even more.
5970409	5972591	This is going to push it even more.
5972591	5978416	I mean, it's going to be, like, five is such a detailed game, like, so much.
5978416	5980938	Like, I'm just absolutely excited.
5981986	5985972	I will stop playing Minecraft for this game.
5985972	5989496	I think the biggest piece of this news is that it's not the Game Awards.
5989496	5993682	You know, a lot of people, a lot of us, us included, we're kind of jumping to the conclusion that, oh, it must be a part of the Game Awards.
5993682	5995665	There still could be something there.
5995665	5997868	They could have a second trailer or something.
5997868	5998409	You never know.
5998834	6000877	I can't wait either, I will watch all of them.
6014697	6018738	I will not be hosting them, I will be watching them.
6018738	6032041	One of my go-to things back in the day was GTA 5 o'clock, and they're coming back for GTA 6 o'clock, and I cannot wait to watch them dive into all of that.
6032041	6035261	That is gonna be my day, for sure.
6035261	6041182	Something that's not quite my day is still the idea that they're even gonna do a live-action Minecraft movie.
6041182	6042603	Like, animated, yes.
6042603	6043543	Live-action, what?
6044364	6045064	What?
6045064	6048926	That doesn't make any sense, but it's still going forward.
6048926	6062033	And now we have the update from Deadline that says that they have added Daniel Brooks and Sebastian Eugene Hansen to the movie's roster.
6062033	6065355	They have unnamed roles so far.
6065355	6069297	We don't know who they're going to play.
6069297	6072219	The movie is set to release... God, really?
6073522	6077385	is set to release April 5th.
6077385	6078166	What?
6078166	6080988	How?
6080988	6082290	I don't know.
6082290	6084151	That's shocking right there.
6084151	6086493	Allegedly coming out April 5th.
6086493	6088275	Of 2026.
6088275	6091658	Not that I want... No, 2024.
6091658	6094460	That's still surprising.
6094460	6095221	And... I...
6100133	6106116	The other thing about this though, like, I don't want to be this person, but I'm going to.
6106116	6109577	It is a Warner Brothers movie.
6109577	6121343	So there's a chance that they'll still cancel it, but no, I mean, yeah, they'll put this out, but they'll cancel, you know, Wile E. Cody and the Roadrunner and stuff.
6122475	6124356	I'll watch it no matter what.
6124356	6125937	It's got Jason Momoa in it.
6125937	6128318	I'll watch it.
6128318	6130499	How bad can it be?
6130499	6131960	Famous last words.
6131960	6134661	It's got my curiosity.
6134661	6135302	Yes.
6135302	6135762	All right.
6135762	6141705	Well, before we wrap up tonight, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out in different countries around the world.
6141705	6143146	We'll start with the U.S.
6143146	6143366	Loki.
6144603	6146364	Yeah, we have a few things.
6146364	6153509	So we have Arashi, Castles of Sin, Final Cut on PC, PlayStation 5, Quest 2, and Quest 3.
6153509	6157171	I'm guessing that PlayStation 5 is PlayStation VR 2.
6157171	6163376	Born of Bread on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6164396	6174365	Disney Dreamlight Valley is getting a release on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6174365	6175566	I guess that's their 1.0.
6175566	6177848	They're out of early access now.
6177848	6179790	Kingpin Reloaded on PC.
6181017	6188640	We have Laika, Aged Through Blood on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6188640	6190741	Lord of the Rings, Return to Moria.
6190741	6194922	Hope this one's better than the last Lord of the Rings games that came out.
6194922	6195883	That's on PlayStation 5.
6196912	6201015	Sonic, Dream Team on Mac and iOS.
6201015	6205179	We have Arizona Sunshine 2 on PC.
6205179	6210543	Once again, probably PlayStation VR 2, Quest 2, and Quest 3.
6210543	6216528	Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6216528	6218670	Wonder what their radio towers are going to look like.
6218670	6221332	Thanks, Ubisoft.
6221332	6222593	Let's see, we've got...
6223314	6252374	Final Fantasy VII Evercrisis on PC Hollow Cocoon on PC Lego Brick Tales VR on Quest 2 and Quest 3 Silence Channel 2 on PC Small Land Survive the Wilds on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader on PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series
6253735	6263667	And, let's see, last but not least, Jean, I'm going to butcher this, Jean, Jean, Sword Miss Beyond the Mountains.
6263667	6266310	That is not pronounced right, but I don't know how to pronounce that.
6266310	6267912	Nintendo Switch.
6267912	6268753	That's it.
6268753	6269034	Enjoy.
6269642	6272866	All right, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases there.
6272866	6273967	We have a few games this week.
6273967	6277552	We have On the Switch, this is off of the Switch, on December the 7th.
6277552	6285321	Rasen Reijo Spiral Oju-sama Chōhatsu no Makina comes out from Silver Star Japan.
6285321	6288826	Encouragement of Climb Next Summit is out on December 7th as well.

6291547	6295468	5 As Divine Menace, Wizards of Brandel, Seek Hearts, and Innocent Revenger Dodonpachi, Blissful Death Reincarnation
6310374	6313277	Valise, Phantasm Soldier Collection 3, Sea of Stars, Shanghai Legend
6329435	6340609	Old School Black and White Mac had the Shanghai, which was just Solitaire Mahjong, like the quintessential game that is still being made, and there's that on the Switch this week on December the 7th.
6340609	6345475	Gigantosaurus, the game, if maybe that's more up your alley than Mahjong, that is out as well.
6345976	6353018	Taiko no Tatsujin Fitbachi is also out from Bandai Namco as well, because that surprised me.
6353018	6354878	Oh, that is an accessory, actually.
6354878	6358619	It's actual little sticks that you can put the controllers on.
6358619	6360200	So it's not actually a game.
6360200	6369642	It is little sticks to tie to your little Switch controllers to get the authentic drumming experience from those games.
6369642	6373103	Let's take a look quickly at the PlayStation 5 and what might be out this next week.
6374904	6379927	In Japan, we have the Avatar game, Frontiers of Pandora, also releases in Japan.
6379927	6386051	And Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade gets a price reduction because it's a new price release.
6386051	6388353	That's it for this week on the PS5.
6388353	6391795	Let's go over to Europe!
6391795	6392936	Can we, for real?
6392936	6393536	Um, anyway.
6393536	6394417	Get in the car.
6394417	6400341	On the 5th, for PlayStation and Xbox, we have Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition.
6400341	6403043	For PlayStation, we have Lord of the Rings Return to Moria.
6404364	6411311	on Twitch, FitnessBoxing, Fistofthenorthstar, also SkaterXL.
6411311	6417117	On the 6th for PlayStation, PlayStation Plus, sorry, Pulse Explorer.
6417117	6422843	On the 7th, oh, that's a card game, never mind, just some Yu-Gi-Oh.
6422843	6427527	On the 7th for computers, we have Sims 4 for Rent.
6428516	6434762	We have for PlayStation Football Manager 2024, which is real football and not American football.

6454551	6463238	And then again, on the 8th for PlayStation, we have Tenten Reporter, Cigars, and the Pharaoh Limited Edition.
6463238	6469304	And last but not least on Switch, on the 8th, Star Wars Heritage Pack.
6469304	6470325	All right.
6470325	6470765	Very cool.
6471653	6472995	Dun dun dun!
6472995	6473775	Dun dun dun.
6473775	6478281	All right, let's move into this final segment here.
6478281	6488172	I don't know if we will have a lot for this segment tonight, but I will quickly invite those of you in chat that have any questions or other topics we didn't talk about that you want to bring up for our listener roundtable.
6488172	6491375	You can do that live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6492456	6493697	We also invite your emails.
6493697	6495377	The mailbox is barren.
6495377	6496958	Well, we'll ask again.
6496958	6502840	Participate at orangelandrade.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6502840	6507982	Of course, we can also always take calls live here on our Discord server, vognetwork.com.
6507982	6514425	I will also look to Loki as I usually do to see if there's any last minute stories tonight.
6514425	6519167	It's not exactly a crazy busy week, but it was like it was not a crazy week, but
6519967	6521368	We were reporting off of Reddit.
6521368	6525011	That should note that it's a slow week.
6525011	6525632	Right.
6525632	6534158	It should be noted that there was an update to Baldur's Gate 3 that added physics to the game.
6534158	6535700	Jiggle physics.
6535700	6539343	And I'm glad that they are equal opportunity offenders.
6539343	6543306	So there is, you know, cock and balls.
6543306	6544307	Cock and balls.
6544307	6545848	That's right.
6545848	6547129	Merry Christmas.
6550632	6552655	It does seem like the type of thing that's up your alley.
6566411	6572954	I'm worried if I play this game it's gonna be something I get sucked into like Elder Scrolls or something like that.
6572954	6577095	Like it seems like it's just pretty cool like Dungeons & Dragons wise.
6577095	6577815	Oh no!
6577815	6580757	I might spend a lot of time on a really good game.
6580757	6581237	I know!
6582397	6584399	And you can multiplayer it.
6584399	6587882	You can, but multiplayer can move really slow.
6587882	6594928	And I learned the hard way from live streaming multiplayer that I actually did not enjoy the experience of live streaming multiplayer.
6594928	6596969	And I talked about this.
6596969	6600212	If I do play again, I probably will use a guide a little bit to help me out.
6600212	6600912	Just be warned.
6600912	6605396	The only thing is, it's very easy to do something stupid that wrecks your whole game.
6605396	6606257	So save often.
6608178	6610619	or use a guide to help you not make those mistakes.
6610619	6612980	That's the only thing.
6612980	6615802	Why don't we just have a tabletop game that we stream?
6615802	6623726	You know, I was promoting on the show the last couple of weeks a series that I did with the Tale of D20s, our friends over there, and it was a lot of fun.
6623726	6626507	I had a lot of fun doing tabletop over there.
6626507	6629828	I wonder if I could ask very, very, very nicely.
6629828	6633230	Maybe somebody over there would be willing to DM a game for us.
6633230	6634271	I think that could be fun.
6637353	6642895	I, I would, I should introduce you to my level of D&D, which was second edition.
6642895	6644155	Oh, well, I don't want to play that.
6644155	6646956	It's too complicated.
6646956	6648396	It's not that complicated.
6648396	6652537	You just need a good DM.
6652537	6658799	All you have to do is be able to do simple math and roll a d20.
6658799	6660500	DarkSakura says, y'all playing D&D?
6660500	6661340	Yeah, sign me up.
6661340	6661680	Who knows?
6661680	6663320	Maybe, maybe a point redeem in the future.
6663320	6663741	We'll see.
6663741	6664421	That could be fun.
6664421	6665121	That could be a lot of fun.
6666104	6670809	Alright, well, I'm going to assume there's no other comments or questions, so that's okay.
6670809	6674212	I still have some steps to go outside and get, even though it's dark, but that's alright.
6674212	6677655	We're going to wrap up our show tonight, but first we have to get final thoughts.
6677655	6681339	But I do want to say, of course, as always, thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6681699	6684461	If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
6684461	6690265	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.
6690265	6696529	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you heard this show goes an awful long way.
6696529	6701272	And as far as VOG Network is concerned, we will be here on Thursday night.
6701272	6704875	At least Bobby and I will be to look at the Game Awards live.
6704875	6710298	We're going to get some fun announcements, so I can't wait to react to all of that stuff live with those of you.
6710298	6710959	And again,
6712940	6718044	There's other people out there live streaming it too, but do ask yourself, is it just going to be a shit on everything fest?
6718044	6721127	Because unfortunately there's too many people out there that will just shit on everything.
6721127	6724189	I promise you a shit free stream.
6724189	6728773	Well, we'll say 99% shit free stream here at VOG Network.
6728773	6731155	That should be the branding.
6731155	6732616	VOG Network, 99% shit free.
6736821	6743502	I have learned that if someone prompts me hard enough on a stream, I'll start giving a full history lesson.
6743502	6744283	All good, all good.
6744283	6749984	Like, going into full-on scholar mode while I'm half asleep and slightly drunk.
6749984	6751484	All right.
6751484	6761606	Well, DarkSakura, maybe not an entire history lesson for your final thought, but before you head off to start playing some Dead by Delight tonight, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
6761606	6762766	Dead by Delight.
6762766	6763246	I like it.
6764395	6774321	Um, I say look beyond the obvious and dig deeper into the history.
6774321	6777243	Question what you're told.
6777243	6781505	And when it's a trickster, DarkSakura, it's always death by delight.
6781505	6782586	Step on me, Trickster Daddy.
6782586	6784928	When it's a trickster, that's the bullshit.
6784928	6786048	That's the bullshit.
6786048	6787829	All right.
6787829	6788370	Bye.
6790083	6793346	Anyway, let's move over next to Loki.
6793346	6795568	Your final thought for us tonight.
6795568	6798791	My final thought is I've got a lot of planning to do.
6798791	6799792	A lot of build planning.
6800626	6802147	Fun.
6802147	6803847	Minecraft City.
6803847	6811531	And then my final thought is eventually I will tear myself away from one of these other ongoing games to catch up on my backlog.
6811531	6813972	I'm looking right at Alan Wake Remastered and Control.
6813972	6816133	I really want to play through that whole trilogy.
6816133	6817134	Someday I'll get there.
6817134	6817714	I will.
6817714	6818694	Someday.
6818694	6823937	Just not today because I have to go walking for my stupid badge in a stupid game that doesn't mean anything.
6823937	6824157	But
6824844	6825344	That's fine.
6825344	6826005	What can I say?
6826005	6826505	I get that.
6826505	6832709	It's like back when we're playing Ingress and you have to go go hit your portal once a day.
6832709	6833909	Otherwise, you'll break the streak.
6833909	6834950	That's right.
6834950	6836111	What can I say?
6836111	6839293	I'm a dumb bitch for achievements.
6839293	6841294	And on that note, have a great week, everybody.
6841294	6842314	And we'll see you next time.
6842314	6843695	Bye.
