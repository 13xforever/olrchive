9668	10849	It's the end of the year bump.
10849	13630	No, not this show's live opening guffaw, that happened already.
13630	21595	As the news quiets down through November, we get one last hurrah in the form of the Video Game Awards and so much of what we'll be looking forward to in 2024, and in some cases 2025.
21595	26838	New games, old games making their return, teasers, troubles, toils, and Tom Petty?
26838	29620	This is the last hurrah of the year, but not the last episode of the year.
29620	34983	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you about the awards reveals of the rest of the week's gaming news.
34983	37245	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
41994	49836	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
49836	60258	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again, episode number 985 of our show for tonight, December the 10th of 2023.
60258	66859	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined each and every week on this program for the last 21 plus years with my co-host.
66859	70240	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
73035	73135	Hey.
73135	73956	Hi, how are you?
93409	114871	as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific you can look at visuals of this show as we are doing this and Loki likes to have games that play behind him while we're live and I thought for a minute I was looking at like the last ninja and now I see elevator action with penguins this must be one of those like homebrew games that's like a hodgepodge of everything
116276	117778	No, this is talking.
117778	120620	This is going into my gaming week.
120620	127565	It's the first season of stuff that's available on the Playdate.
127565	130107	Oh, OK.
130107	132910	Yeah, so like I got I got the little thing.
132910	134451	It's it's tiny.
134451	143418	It's it's it's like a Game Boy, but I mean, it's pretty much like a Game Boy because it doesn't have a backlight on the screen.
143418	144519	It's kind of got one of those like
145350	147110	E Ink type screens.
147110	149851	So pretty cool.
149851	150951	You can get a bunch of games for it.
150951	152812	It has a little crank on it and stuff.
152812	159913	So part of it, it comes with a season of games, which is 24 games to unlock two a week.
159913	161914	Or you can go into your account and unlock them all.
161914	168275	But it's good to just do two a week because then you get to play them and actually you know, check them all out.
168275	169256	Interesting.
169256	170716	Yeah, it's been pretty fun.
170716	171796	Interesting.
171796	173557	So how long ago did you order one of those?
173557	174857	Because weren't they back ordered for a little bit?
176054	177556	Have you done homebrew to it?
184324	188126	Um, no, they have their own like shop.
188126	193307	I mean, you can sideload stuff pretty easy with it as well.
193307	195548	I'm going to at some point put on there.
195548	198409	They have a Game Boy emulator that someone made for it.
198409	198890	Of course.
198890	202411	I mean, of course, I got to put that on there.
202411	208393	I haven't got a chance to sideload anything yet just because there's been a lot on the shop that looked OK.
208393	210634	And I was going to check some of those things out.
210634	213515	So I downloaded a few things, but it's
214141	221469	Yeah, it's only got the like, you know, the old Wi-Fi, so it's not super fast when it comes to downloading stuff.
221469	225874	But yeah, I have to really dig through itch.io and see what else is out there.
225874	228397	But a lot of the stuff that's on there is also on their shop.
228397	229578	So it's like, you know.
230233	232114	And I can't imagine those games are very big.
232114	237056	I mean, no, there's only four gigabytes of storage, non expandable.
237056	242519	And the games themselves, like the biggest game I've downloaded so far has been like 92 megs.
242519	244660	So it's pretty small.
244660	246181	I mean, it's all black and white.
246181	248242	So black and white.
248242	249182	It does.
249182	255205	The audio is like it's not just like chip tune stuff, but you can do like MP3s and things.
255205	257627	Obviously, it's not very powerful to
258627	279106	do all that stuff and they could get pretty large so they have you know different techniques and stuff with it but it it's uh you know the the screen can refresh up to like uh 50 fps it's pretty fast like it gets pretty fancy with some of those things especially like just the interface and everything's very um cool with it too just
279639	281981	the way they do everything in the games.
281981	284563	So all right, I've been super curious about play data.
284563	286584	I kind of want to check it out at some point.
286584	289587	So I'm going to come borrow yours for a little bit.
289587	291468	Okay, I'm curious about it.
291468	299634	And because I am looking in our chat room live, there was a comment about I think Zen Monkey had said something about how long does the system last after you crank it up?
299634	302757	And important to know that the crank is not for power.
303478	303980	No, it's not.
311340	313081	I mean, I don't know.
313081	314522	It charges very fast.
314522	319645	But the thing is, too, like the screen always stays on because it's like one of those e-reader screens.
319645	323607	So as long as it's not updating, it doesn't use any power.
323607	325928	It's just on or off.
325928	328749	And it's the the updating is what takes power.
328749	335373	So unlike your typical like a phone or something like that, where it leaves the screen on all the time, they'll drain the battery.
335373	336113	This does not.
336113	340796	In fact, it just has like you can put a clock on it and it'll just stay like that.
341648	345251	And, you know, it just draws very little power.
345251	355498	I think my kids are playing around with it yesterday, and I think even them just using it is like maybe 10% after an hour.
355498	358420	Like, I think it's got a pretty decent battery life in it.
358420	359100	All right.
359100	364084	Well, I'm going to go back and check in because I think we do have them just without the VTube.
364084	365425	Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
367455	368996	I just haven't turned it back on yet.
368996	369356	Oh, okay.
369356	373559	That's I thought maybe that was part of what was going on with the system.
373559	375080	But hello.
375080	377082	Sorry, there's a tech difficulty tonight.
377082	379743	But I think it's it is for a good reason, right?
379743	385287	Because you got upgrades to your computer, if I remember the text, right?
385287	387329	I just upgraded the operating system.
387329	387709	Well, that's
388188	389709	That's still that's still an upgrade.
389709	398197	I get excited whenever my phone gets a new updating system because the latest one brought us the the fact that the phones can mate.
398197	408546	Because when I was I met somebody out at the club, and we just we touched our foot, we made our phones kiss, they went one and then they share the contact data.
408546	410748	And that's like the types of things they give us with new updates.
410748	411108	I like it.
413869	428320	Well, in this case, when you have certain applications that their creators do not update them in conjunction with operating system updates, updating immediately is not a good thing.
428320	433684	If you're in the middle of working on a graphic project or a video project, you don't upgrade in the middle of it.
434451	435312	That is true.
435312	450627	I can think of several games that like the creators have just kind of abandoned them for whatever reason or I remember I mean this is several years old at this point but I do remember like when the 64-bit stuff became I think it was mandatory or whatever we lost things like Flappy Bird, RIP, Rest in Pepperoni.
451027	455811	but Flappy Bird doesn't run anymore, and other abandoned games, basically.
455811	458853	Maybe on a more positive note... Oh, I wasn't talking about games.
458853	465778	I was talking about my OBS, or my Logic Pro products, or my Final Cut projects.
465778	470402	I had to already uninstall a couple of plugins for my Logic because they're not compatible anymore.
471539	472280	Happy Hanukkah!
484791	488873	4th Night, so we are smack dab in the middle.
488873	505100	And number two, I was kind of giggling because you and I, out of the blue, apparently updated our YouTube channels today with new YouTubes about 15 minutes apart because I noticed on Blue Sky, I uploaded a video from something I'm going to talk about a little later during my game of the week.
505100	508722	And then you uploaded a Dead by Daylight video, which I don't, I,
510023	511265	It is a newer thing for you, right?
511265	523042	Because I noticed it was like edited, like you you didn't like have an entire DVD match, you kind of like we're cutting and pasting the highlights, I guess, taking out the boring running across the map.
523042	523863	Yeah.
523863	524144	Okay.
525086	532215	Yeah, and I sped up a few things, and I did my first instant replay.
532215	536841	There was a scene, and it was like a half a second, you would have missed it.
536841	541367	But I remembered seeing it when I was playing the game, because there had been
541867	547850	I opened the locker and was just about to reach for the other one when the Yui got out of it.
547850	551751	And you see her for like a split second.
551751	553632	I remembered seeing her.
553632	558474	So I actually had to go back, freeze frame, put a cricket sound effect.
558474	562376	That's why when you watch a video I make, watch it all the way through, please.
562376	564677	And then... Like, comment, subscribe.
564677	564837	Yeah.
566294	577297	Well, I guess it's very clear both DarkSakura and I are going to ride the coattails of LokiOLR's YouTube success.
577297	577837	I'm teasing.
577837	578337	I'm teasing.
578337	586580	But you know, Loki, you've had some good success on YouTube with some of the stuff you've been doing for Minecraft.
586580	593742	I will point out that I have had my YouTube channel since about a year before Thunder
595147	606535	Big Thunder Barbecue I think we had you cut out again.
606535	610338	You said something about Big Thunder Barbecue.
610338	615942	I had my YouTube channel about a year and a half prior to that.
615942	618144	Because one of your early videos is that, right?
619637	625363	One of my early videos is Julian when he was three.
625363	628486	I just didn't use it much, but I've had it for a while.
628486	631069	I have like random gaming things on my channel.
631069	638677	But now I'm like, Oh, I should actually use this nice setup I have to record like, you know, 2k things off my PC and 4k things on my PlayStation.
638677	639578	It's kind of fun sometimes.
641069	646811	Alright, well anyway, let's get into the news, because there was quite a bit of it this week, as Jason talked about in the intro.
646811	653774	This is that kind of time of year where we get another bump in announcements, and a large part of that is thanks to the Game Awards.
653774	658536	Now, you know, usually we kind of recap everything that we saw at the Game Awards.
658536	660997	We'll get into some of the highlights as we get into the news.
660997	664019	I don't think we need to go through the laundry list of all the announcements, because
664639	673122	kind of what I wanted to focus on here at the top of the show was, well, A, let me just kind of get like people's overall thoughts, like for those that were able to watch it.
673122	681124	And I think everyone here, I at least saw in the chat for part of the, I did a show with Bobby Blackwolf on Thursday, we did a co-stream.
681124	685285	And by the way, programming note, Bobby Blackwolf was not live tonight here at VOG Network.
685285	688186	He usually is at eight o'clock Eastern, five o'clock Pacific.
688186	690247	Everything is 100% A, okay with Bobby.
690247	693948	He just had a personal conflict, so he wasn't able to do the show tonight, but he'll be back next week.
694788	700113	Um, so, um, but what I really wanted to get into was the Game Awards.
700113	705398	We were streaming that, and I saw DarkSakura in chat for a bit, and I saw Loki in chat for a bit, so I know everybody at least saw a piece of it.
705398	716888	Um, so I'm kind of curious, like, overall what folks' thoughts were on the Game Awards, because there's been some very strong reaction on social media that's kind of surprised me a little bit, but I'll wait and get into that in a minute.
716888	718469	Um, DarkSakura, do you have any thoughts?
721403	723284	and into the channel to lurk.
723284	729947	I literally went into lurking left because I've had a lot of IRL stuff going on.
729947	731328	Sure.
731328	733509	Oh, I actually didn't watch.
733509	741753	And I honestly award shows don't interest me, even if it's video game stuff, because it's all arbitrary.
741753	744635	The people don't really get too much of a say in it, you know?
744635	746235	Yeah.
746235	748797	So if I wanted to watch critics,
749761	755485	talk about video games, I would just listen to us because we're better.
755485	755945	Fair enough.
755945	758047	We're more interesting.
758047	758867	Loki, what about you?
758867	760008	How much of it were you able to catch?
760008	760949	Did you like it?
760949	762089	Most of it, I think.
762089	766252	So, I mean, it was good announcement trailer wise.
766252	771396	I don't think it really got didn't really highlight developers too much.
771396	773117	It seemed very rushed.
773117	776139	I mean, a lot of it was very, very, very rushed.
778359	782121	But I mean, that's kind of the nature of the beast because they got to pay for it.
782121	782822	Right.
782822	787045	And, you know, they don't have time for all that stuff.
787045	788466	But yeah, it was very rushed.
788466	793489	But yeah, some exciting announcement trailers and stuff like that were pretty cool to see.
793789	799053	Yeah, I know things that aren't coming up later in the show like the Exodus trailer.
799053	801996	I really liked that one because that was the one that Matthew McConaughey introduced.
801996	804338	But if I'm not mistaken, he wasn't in the trailer.
804338	810543	But when I watched the trailer, I was like, I'm literally watching like Mass Effect with different aliens.
810543	816027	Like this is this is a game by somebody who liked Mass Effect, who wanted to make their own Mass Effect game.
816027	819290	I was like, but I was into it because you know, you know, what's funny?
819290	820370	I really like Mass Effect.
820370	822012	So I think that this is the
824949	828471	Are you saying that this is like Fifty Shades of Grey to Twilight?
828471	833654	No, no, because it's like Mass Effect Interstellar Edition.
833654	836656	It didn't look like awful fanfic.
836656	845000	It looked more like, yeah, like Interstellar, like actually, you know, say what you will about Matthew McConaughey, like Interstellar, like was an incredible movie.
845000	847702	So like, yeah, like if it's that side of Matthew McConaughey,
848422	853427	All right, all right, all right, I say to this this game is that that game look really good.
853427	856250	But anyway, like, you know, I don't want to I don't want to focus too much on one trailer.
856250	858613	That's just one that like caught my eye.
858613	862316	But overall, yeah, it was a lot of trailers and things like that.
862316	864599	But that's what the game awards have always been.
864599	869324	And I I've been really shocked at some of the response on social media about people that are like,
869964	872045	Oh, this is this game boards are terrible.
872045	873746	It's nothing but a commercial.
873746	875427	It's all these ads and trailers.
875427	878708	And they they give more time to the trailers and always rush through the awards.
878708	881369	It's like, why are you all acting brand new?
881369	884450	This is like the 10th year that they have had these awards.
884450	886191	And it's been the same thing every year.
886191	892254	And if you weren't aware, because you know, I don't know if you noticed, but renting out the Peacock theater is expensive.
892754	896455	paying all those people to put on a broadcast behind the scenes is expensive.
896455	899716	All the lights, the orchestra, all that stuff is expensive.
899716	905117	And so yeah, they bring in ads and they do a lot of trailers to pay for all of that.
905117	907918	So no, the focus isn't on the awards.
907918	909058	They haven't been.
909058	914319	But here's, here's what blows my mind because people are like, well, we need the Game Awards to be nothing but awards.
914319	917740	We want to see people give these full speeches, which I don't disagree with.
917740	920901	And I do want to say it's not that I'm not here to
921621	924863	you know, make out with Jeff Keighley and say his show is perfect.
924863	925343	It's not.
925343	926603	There are things I wouldn't prove.
926603	933286	And yeah, the optics of Wrap It Up after 30 seconds of a speech, like it was, it was not good, right?
933286	941010	When they, when Baldur's Gate 3 won Game of the Year, and they were dedicating it to somebody on the team who had passed, and somebody in the audience shot how the Wrap It Up light was flashing.
941010	942631	Those, the optics on that, pretty shitty.
943231	947955	But to be fair to Jeff, he did acknowledge the day after that shouldn't have happened.
947955	950237	We'll work on that so it wraps up next year.
950237	955742	I mean, honestly, with love and respect, blame Christopher Judge for that.
955742	960406	And I say blame, but I don't like that created a viral moment.
960406	962327	Like, just let people ramble.
962327	967051	Like, yeah, I know you're going to have to pay overtime or whatever, but maybe maybe plan for that a little bit.
967051	967552	I don't know.
967552	969694	But anyway, the point I really wanted to get to was about
970174	973338	the awards and people are like, they should just give awards.
973338	975540	It should be nothing but that.
975540	979224	Hello, that they do that at other shows.
979224	986592	And when have you ever tweeted, skeeted, bleated, peated about any of those things?
986592	990977	Because did you know that there are DICE awards, GDC awards,
992209	997453	Japan Game Awards, those don't get the same type of social media traction.
997453	1007741	99% of the people, I guarantee it, 99% of the people complaining, saying the Game Awards needs to be nothing but an award show, have never posted about one of the actual award shows that are going on.
1007741	1010584	Including, you know what, even the day before, the day of the devs.
1011730	1014873	So I'm just saying, know what you're getting into with this.
1014873	1027465	Yeah, the awards are a little bit of an afterthought to what's going on with the trailers and the announcements and the fact that this is a little bit of a winter E3, but the reality is you would not be talking about it if it didn't have that stuff.
1028527	1030569	but could they tighten it up a little bit?
1030569	1032150	Sure.
1032150	1041078	I thought the OD stuff that Hideo Kojima debuted, even though they must've changed the name of that because I thought that leaked as a game called Overdose.
1041078	1042460	Do you remember that, Loki?
1042460	1045502	When that leaked, there was a game called Overdose that leaked about a year ago, right?
1045502	1051568	OD usually means to overdose, so it's essentially the same title.
1051568	1054651	Yeah, I guess, but they've been calling it that, which is interesting, and then, yeah, I don't know.
1055091	1057457	But that did go on a little long.
1057457	1063731	Now, the news that Jordan Peele is collaborating with that, I think, is kind of a big deal.
1066055	1075202	But it also shows that one of Jeff's weak spots, I think right now, and overall, I do think he does a good job with the cards that are dealt.
1075202	1082508	I do think there's maybe some things he could stand to cut back or cut out and, you know, allow the speakers a little more time or whatever.
1082508	1092755	But, um, you know, one of the things I think he is not great about is that he gives a little too much to the film industry.
1093656	1097658	And I do understand, again, Jordan Peele, big fucking deal in the game industry.
1097658	1100620	The fact he's working with Hideo Kojima, big deal.
1100620	1105582	Did we need to hear the whole bit about, I grew up on your games and the love affair and all that?
1105582	1108644	Maybe, maybe not so much, but you know what?
1108644	1109644	Okay.
1109644	1115708	But I think then where people really start to get lost is like Timothee Chalamet giving away the Game of the Year award.
1115708	1115948	Why?
1117150	1118812	why it did Timothee Chalamet.
1118812	1125217	Yeah, even even Midna or one of the some cat has something to say about that.
1125217	1129501	She hops up on me and then gets testy when I pet her.
1129501	1132624	But why is Timothee Chalamet giving away a Game of the Year award?
1132624	1134686	He's not he didn't even have a game out there to promote.
1134686	1136047	And I was like, what the fuck?
1136047	1137328	He's a YouTuber.
1137328	1137889	Yeah, Rob.
1138369	1142953	Yeah, it took me a minute to get that because they introduced him as a YouTuber, the Xbox 360.
1142953	1146515	Oh, yeah, that was a joke like three years ago.
1146515	1150538	Like, no, no, like he did not need to give out the Game of the Year award.
1150538	1150898	I'm sorry.
1150898	1152039	And this is no diss on him.
1152039	1157323	It's just stop seeking validation from an industry that you don't need validation from.
1157323	1162207	In fact, if you look at the latest trends in Hollywood, it's kind of the other way around right now.
1162947	1165749	So stop seeking validation from the film industry.
1165749	1167531	You don't need it.
1167531	1178579	So where I think it ought to be going is that the Game of the Year award, if you do look at the Oscars, who tends to present the Oscar for Best Picture?
1178579	1181262	They get a legend out there, right?
1181262	1182783	They get a Cher.
1183163	1195453	They get a Meryl Streep, a Julia Roberts, Liza Minnelli, that was the one that her and Gaga came out one year to do Best Picture, right, or some award, but they get a fucking legend out there on stage to give out the award.
1195453	1197715	Why don't you do the same for gaming?
1197715	1200036	Get Ken and Roberta Williams to give the award.
1200036	1209384	Get a Sid Meier, get a Will Wright, get somebody who's like a legend in games to give out that award, especially because you kind of stopped
1209884	1216529	that award for the Hall of Fame that I forget what they call it, but they used to actually Roberta and Ken Williams won it the very first year.
1216529	1221533	It was like a Vanguard or something they did for a few years, they got rid of it around like 2018 or so.
1221533	1221573	So
1224093	1224954	Yeah.
1224954	1230638	And Tigerclaw says, regarding Timothee Chalamet, he used to be a modder for the Xbox 360 controller.
1230638	1232259	I mean, I get it.
1232259	1234000	I'm saying not fucking good enough.
1234000	1236562	And that meme is years old at this point.
1236562	1242166	Like, if you have to explain the joke, the joke didn't work.
1243410	1245091	And it's as simple as that.
1245091	1249593	So, um, I, I, I just think that was a poor decision on Jeff's part.
1249593	1265519	And I would like to see maybe more gaming legends and people within the industry, um, actually giving out some of the awards and they, you know, they were having people introduce segments of the, they, they try to mix up a little bit, but I just, you don't, you don't need to have Hollywood.
1265519	1268581	You don't need their validation, have that about the games.
1268581	1268701	So.
1271702	1278784	I think the optics of Jeff having Kojima have 5-10 minutes for his projects, yet they rush through everything else doesn't look good.
1278784	1287006	But one perspective, if you want the show to have, say, fewer trailers for War Room for Speeches, they need those massive moments like Jordan Peele and Kojima.
1287006	1289867	Moments help sell the show to outside advertisers.
1289867	1296189	You get a big advertiser, the show will get that additional revenue stream that you don't need to have 100 trailers to pay the show.
1297918	1312167	I think they could have tightened it up a little bit, but I do not understand some of the outrage on social media about a show that essentially has not changed its formula in several years now, and people are acting shocked.
1312167	1313788	So I don't know what to tell you.
1315609	1319652	Let's see, Questbusters pointing out that Xiaomei has a movie coming out.
1319652	1323694	Yeah, weird flex for the VGAs, but I wouldn't be surprised if it had something to do with it on some level, too.
1323694	1328357	Yeah, but they didn't promote the movie, so... And if there's a tie-in game, I bet it's garbage.
1328357	1333441	So, yeah, Simu Liu is at the show as well, and he voiced a character in a video game, too.
1333441	1337063	Well, that's... At least he's there to promote a game.
1337063	1339685	Like Matthew McConaughey, there to promote a game.
1339685	1341386	Jordan Peele, there to promote a game.
1341906	1359513	Even the guy from Twisted Metal, I'm sorry, I forgot his name, but he at least, he took a little bit of a long time, but at least I was like, oh, he was there because he was announcing that it was getting a second season on Peacock, at least, thank you, Anthony Mackie, at least he was announcing that it was getting a second season on Peacock, right?
1359513	1361134	So at least there was a point.
1361134	1364075	I didn't get the point with Timothee Chalamet.
1364075	1365376	So that's all.
1366533	1372295	Anyway, DJRamaS says, part of the issue is that there's always new people watching and a lot of the complaints are coming from the newer eyes on this.
1372295	1374036	Yeah, there is that.
1374036	1382018	And you know, again, some of the other optics are not great, because like accessibility and gaming, that award was given out during the pre show.
1382018	1386760	And it was like, you know, it's kind of, you know, rapid fire, essentially, type of award.
1386760	1390922	And I think there are people out there that would like to see those types of things uplifted.
1390922	1391482	However,
1392639	1396341	Those comments come off a little bit of slacktivism.
1396341	1399643	Sorry, I know people hate that word, but that's what it is.
1399643	1404926	If you are not also out there uplifting those moments when they happen.
1404926	1408929	So were you talking about the indie showcase that happened the day before?
1408929	1412391	Have you been talking about other types of accessibility?
1412391	1414092	If so, great.
1414092	1420716	But there's a lot of people out there that only want to talk the talk when it's convenient.
1420716	1422057	And I'm just saying it's not a good look.
1423103	1430788	So, but I at the end of the day, yeah, of course, I would like to see more time for the you know, things like best RPG and all these things being rapid fire.
1430788	1432369	It's not great.
1432369	1435151	But what are the alternatives?
1435151	1437473	You're not watching the shows that are nothing but awards.
1438732	1465798	but I and I haven't seen I haven't seen the ratings for the game awards yet but I imagine it was a fucking lot of people especially when you consider just how many platforms that show is on like when you were looking at like streams in China streams and like all these other countries like it I that thing was going out on like 100 different platforms at once wild so I'm sure it had more viewers than most probably the Oscars it probably had more viewers than the Oscars quite frankly
1467335	1470457	Anyway, oh yeah, Tiger Claw does remind me of a funny moment.
1470457	1474399	Christopher Judge poked fun at that by taking a stab at Call of Duty.
1474399	1477881	He said something along the lines about his speech being longer than Call of Duty's campaign.
1477881	1479002	That was funny.
1479002	1480102	I love a good read.
1480102	1482124	So that was, that was funny.
1482124	1486006	But like, yeah, if you're gonna get up and tell a joke, tell the joke, move on.
1486006	1489028	I actually, actually, Christopher Judge this year did great.
1489788	1503785	I think it's it's funny in the sense that like haha yeah Call of Duty's campaigns are short but then also the developers for Call of Duty were like dude what the hell like you know that ain't cool poking fun at our game we're not poking fun at your game
1506254	1516624	DJRamaS says, didn't one of the presenters get banned from the theater for life?
1516624	1519867	Yeah, the one that jumped up on stage in the middle of the Game of the Year award.
1519867	1520688	He wasn't a presenter.
1520688	1521929	He was a clown.
1521929	1523851	So he got banned.
1523851	1528375	Yeah, SJ100Matt says, folks were also disappointed with Jeff about not acknowledging the layoffs.
1528655	1540503	Yeah, I think there was room to have a little bit of acknowledgement for that, you know, or something about maybe like dedicating a certain award or a certain segment to, you know, folks in the industry have been impacted.
1540503	1550870	I think a nice quick little thing would have been great because he did do it a couple of years ago when there was, you know, a lot of other stuff going on in this industry that needed to be talked about.
1550870	1557675	So it would have been nice to, you know, again, I think the way kind of Ben Starr put it in that viral clip that was going around Twitter,
1558115	1561796	about, you know, on one hand, yeah, we can celebrate.
1561796	1565737	But on the other hand, it's hard to celebrate when dot dot dot.
1565737	1570759	So it would be it would have been nice to have an acknowledgement to that.
1570759	1572979	Again, I don't think Jeff is perfect.
1572979	1575540	And I think yes, there are ways the awards can improve.
1575540	1577000	And I've pointed out a few of them.
1577000	1586123	I just think that there's a lot of people out there commenting on it who very clearly had no idea what they were about to watch.
1586123	1586543	That's that.
1587881	1588221	All right.
1588221	1591582	Yeah, DarkSakura says, sounds like the upgraded security worked this year.
1591582	1593323	Oh, yeah, you could see it in the background.
1593323	1601806	You could see that they had, you know, large men standing at the front of the stage, and there was little like a little barrier at the front.
1601806	1606688	And so they only let two people through at a time, except for I think the game of the year, they let a few more.
1607128	1631435	and so forth like it was it was very hard to miss the extra security but like good because we didn't get a clown moment this year and that's that's the last thing we needed on top of everything else was another clownery to steal everything so well there is still the heckling or something in the crowd when Anthony Mackie was on stage and granted he did a terrible job and was just talking to them which
1633137	1634278	Yeah, they need to discourage.
1634278	1634759	I agree.
1634759	1638342	Don't, don't talk to hecklers, especially when we can't hear them on the stream.
1638342	1639083	Right?
1639083	1645169	So it's, it's why sometimes I'm like, if we're going to respond to a chat comment, we have to read it because the podcast, it's the same thing.
1645169	1648532	If you could, you only have the information that you can hear or whatever to work with.
1648532	1652857	So yeah, that that was kind of a rookie mistake on his part.
1652857	1655920	But if he doesn't present awards every day, you know,
1657618	1664686	sjo100mat says, easiest solution would be to extend the pre-show to sneak more awards in, but they're kind of damned either way.
1664686	1676800	I maybe would look to doing something like the Oscars, where maybe the night before they do, or I think the Oscars actually do it the month before or something like that, they do like the technical awards evening.
1677521	1679542	and but stream that too.
1679542	1690188	Just maybe don't you don't have to have the same amount of trailers or maybe you have some big indie announcements, some of the things that like we got a day of the death, you know, have it have a different kind of show and then do your big big award show.
1690188	1691849	It can be their daytime Emmys.
1691849	1692970	Yeah, exactly.
1692970	1695011	There's no reason not to.
1695011	1698793	Actually, you make me think about Summer Game Fest.
1698793	1700414	Move some awards to Summer Game Fest.
1702696	1711279	Especially things like the eSports Creator of the Year, things that don't have to do with game design.
1711279	1714940	What were you saying, Jamie?
1714940	1719161	I still think that it should be a winter event because you are summing up the year.
1721263	1724125	And anything can happen in that 6 month period.
1742074	1746017	Somebody out there is going to be quick to point out, oh, Rob, but esports people watch for that.
1746017	1747558	People are watching for the personalities.
1747558	1749860	People are watching to see their favorite name win.
1749860	1762090	And I suppose there could be some point to that, but I, I would be very curious to survey a wide swath of Game Award watchers and see what it really is that they're tuning in for.
1762090	1770537	And I bet esports personalities, not nearly the register that game trailers are, but I guess we'll never know unless we ask them.
1772222	1775785	Anyway, one other thing to ask about our gaming week.
1775785	1781049	So the types of things that we have been playing this week as opposed to just watching Game Awards on television.
1781049	1784072	So let's go to DarkSakura and talk about your gaming week.
1784072	1787034	How was your gaming week?
1787034	1790157	I played some Dead by Daylight.
1790157	1793660	Um, I, I've been playing a lot of Killer lately.
1796857	1797577	What else did I do?
1797577	1799998	I played Dreamlight Valley.
1799998	1802818	I've played Rudra no Hiho.
1802818	1809679	I finished Shion's first... Shion's scenario, and I'm on Risa's scenario.
1809679	1815320	And I'm actually really starting to see how the different stories are intertwined.
1815320	1818981	It's a pretty neat concept.
1818981	1823382	So I played a little bit of World Cup Soccer Pinball.
1824914	1828536	And, uh, yeah, that's really, that's really it.
1828536	1833058	Did some new stuff for YouTube because I've been neglecting it.
1833058	1841441	But mostly my time has been taken up by, uh, preparing for ballet recital next Saturday.
1841441	1845723	And, uh, and, uh, my, my new rotation at work.
1845723	1848744	So it's been taking a lot of attention.
1848744	1849485	I understand.
1849485	1852786	I've just had some days where I just haven't felt like sitting through a whole game.
1853882	1855163	DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1861786	1867867	All right, Loki, I know we talked a little bit about the Playdate, but how was your gaming week, Playdate or otherwise?
1867867	1871688	So, yeah, I did play a few games on the Playdate.
1871688	1879110	So one, the two games that come with it, the first unlocks, I guess, of season one.
1879110	1886352	So there is one that's called Casual Birder, and it is a bird photography game, which is kind of funny.
1886352	1886672	It's cute.
1888012	1889833	So that one was kind of neat.
1889833	1892576	There's like a little like RPG that goes along with it.
1892576	1894197	This one actually is kind of fun.
1894197	1903063	It's White Water Wipeout, and it's essentially surfing from California games, except you use the crank to steer.
1903063	1904485	So.
1904485	1909488	I mean, I immediately knew how to play that game, so that was awesome.
1909488	1910009	What else?
1910009	1916514	Oh, I did get a game called Gun Trails, and it is a bullet hell game.
1917802	1919783	It is hard for me to play that.
1919783	1921464	The screen is so tiny.
1921464	1931609	It is, you know, vertical scrolling game, but you know, the screen's not a vertical screen and it's, you know, obviously not backlit and I'm old.
1931609	1934351	So, um, I didn't do as well.
1934351	1935311	My son liked it though.
1935311	1938413	So that was, it's a very pretty looking game.
1938413	1939974	Um, so I'm going to check that out.
1939974	1946077	Um, I also got another one called P racing, which is basically kind of like a, um,
1947961	1954449	Along the lines of Pole Position, that type of game.
1954449	1959695	It's pretty cool, it's like a pseudo 3D racer.
1959695	1961877	Looking forward to checking out more stuff in there as well.
1963619	1979631	outside of the playdate i did play lethal company which is a brand new indie game kind of along the lines of like phasmophobia the premise is basically that you are part of this company to have to go raid these very dangerous planets for scrap and bring them back to this
1982201	1988864	It might as well be just one of the old ones, a Cthulhu-type, monster-type thing.
1988864	2005930	But it's certainly geared towards streamers and stuff, and the fact that there's just all sorts of dangerous things, you can't see anything very well, and the voice chat that's in there, it's all muffled like you're talking through your suit and stuff.
2005930	2010312	So that was a lot of fun to play that, and I'll probably have to go back and play that some more.
2011894	2015680	And then of course, you know, Minecraft stuff, been doing that.
2015680	2019325	So on the playdate, why did I get a playdate?
2019325	2021749	I got the itch again.
2021749	2022510	You know that itch.
2024723	2032068	I had an idea for something stupid, but then I'm actually not thinking of doing that anymore.
2032068	2034630	I may do something a little more straightforward.
2034630	2037752	I have to say though, it's a lot more complicated than I thought.
2037752	2041776	They have various ways to code games for it.
2044750	2050134	drag and drop editor type of thing that you can make some basic stuff with called Pulp.
2050134	2052796	And then you can actually code stuff in Lua.
2052796	2061143	And then if you really want to get more like performant, then you can do C. So I have to look and see how complicated a lot of stuff is.
2061143	2067768	But like one of the ideas I was looking at it the other day, because one of the things I wanted to find for it is like, hey, is there a mini golf game for this?
2067768	2069590	Because like that would be pretty cool.
2069590	2071471	There is not a mini golf game for it.
2071471	2071932	So like,
2072552	2075297	That could be something that we find the play around with.
2075297	2076679	So, I'm just gonna look at it.
2076679	2079784	I'm not committing to anything yet, but it might be something, you know.
2081158	2084919	But yeah, I did have, I had dumb ideas for that as well.
2084919	2085679	So we'll see.
2085679	2086580	I don't know.
2086580	2087560	All right.
2087560	2089201	I'm curious to see what you come up with.
2089201	2090641	I think that would be fun.
2090641	2091801	Yeah, we'll see.
2091801	2092022	All right.
2092022	2093582	I'm excited to hear you get in the itch again.
2093582	2095102	It's great.
2095102	2095603	Um, okay.
2095603	2096383	My gaming week.
2096383	2097703	So this is interesting.
2097703	2099824	Um, I've become a Fortnite gamer.
2099824	2102505	Uh, and I didn't think I'd ever say those words on the show.
2102505	2106826	Look, I've tried Fortnite before, but I just, I, I, I'm just not good at battle royale.
2106826	2108787	And I, I, I hate that it's,
2109427	2115615	I don't have like a tutorial I could just play by myself to learn how to play unless maybe that's in there now and I just haven't found it.
2115615	2117037	I think they might have that actually.
2117037	2121643	Yeah, maybe they do and I just haven't found that but I'm just yeah.
2121643	2123865	So I don't really care for the battle royale game itself.
2123865	2124806	But here's the thing.
2125347	2127949	Now Fortnite has all these extra things in it.
2127949	2132453	As of this week, they started launching other things within Fortnite.
2132453	2140379	So now we have, you might remember some time ago, Epic bought Harmonix, right, the makers of many different music games.
2140379	2143222	And this week, they launched Fortnite Festival.
2143222	2147805	And it's literally just Rock Band, but purple in Fortnite.
2147805	2148045	Now,
2149279	2174021	there's criticisms to be had about how much they're charging for songs they have like a free rotation and you can buy a battle pass if you want to get some that way or what but like I I don't I don't I'm not spending money on that there's plenty in the free rotation that rotate in and out every day that I can get my fill and that's that's what it is you play it like twice and then it's like okay I've had my fill I'm not gonna do like a marathon session but like
2174762	2179526	It has been kind of neat to just join like a random squad and somebody takes lead.
2179526	2181287	Somebody does vocals and so forth.
2181287	2182548	And there it is.
2182548	2183829	You just get right in the song.
2183829	2185050	Mike Def says, Oh, really?
2185050	2186831	Songs are locked in the battle pass.
2186831	2187772	Yeah, it does.
2187772	2190815	It does like a daily rotation, like a lot of games like that.
2190815	2191795	I get it.
2191795	2195558	It's a you have licensed music in a free to play game.
2195558	2196799	You have to charge for it.
2196799	2197880	I mean, it makes sense.
2197880	2199421	It's granted.
2199421	2202203	Yes, they're going to try to make a lot of money off of this as well.
2202203	2204325	But like, it's not unreasonable to think that
2205089	2205429	DarkSakura
2233559	2242490	is that Fortnite is like a portal, and Battle Royale or Battle Royale Zero Build, that is the game that all of you are calling Fortnite.
2242490	2245915	Fortnite is now a portal to all these other things as well.
2245915	2248418	Fortnite is almost like a virtual platform.
2248418	2250861	At this point, it's like a PlayStation 5, but online.
2251570	2260854	Yeah, just imagine like, for example, imagine that Fortnite is Roblox, but Roblox actually making their own games as well on top of it.
2260854	2263615	And it's also not Roblox because, you know, Roblox is kind of...
2264372	2265732	Meh.
2265732	2267133	But it is like that.
2267133	2270114	They're developing their own games for this now platform that they're making.
2270114	2274815	They have like indie developers as well on there making other things.
2274815	2277696	It's a platform where they can do that.
2277696	2284517	So that's kind of what they're doing here is they're like kind of showcasing and also, you know, monetizing.
2284517	2286058	Hey, look, we have a racing game.
2286058	2287078	We have a music game.
2287078	2288939	We have a survival building game.
2288939	2289919	We have, you know,
2290379	2292600	Battle Royale, look at all these things you can do.
2292600	2293421	It's working.
2293421	2297403	There were more people playing Lego Fortnite than anything else.
2297403	2303426	And by a wide margin, like if you combined Zero Build and regular Battle Royale, I think there were about a million people.
2303426	2306708	There were two million playing Lego Fortnite.
2308048	2309649	Lego Fortnite is Minecraft
2325436	2334365	And it's a little more what you would have thought, where you're beating up rocks to get wood, rocks, and then you go and you build.
2334365	2335847	It really is a lot like Minecraft.
2335847	2338229	I mean, Loki, you probably could give a better analysis on this.
2338229	2348259	But the one part that's different is that when you go to build something big, you actually do a virtual snapping of different blocks together to build it, which I
2348319	2349379	I did think was cute.
2349379	2355302	I thought that was a cute little, you know, thing to kind of like, otherwise, it's like, what the fuck does this have to do with Lego?
2355302	2357923	And then when you did that, I was like, Oh, okay, that's super cute.
2357923	2358724	I like that.
2358724	2365647	So yeah, I didn't play very much because you know, I was going back to the festival to get high scores.
2365647	2367627	But I played through a little bit of the tutorial.
2367627	2370229	Oh, yeah, I went too far away from the base.
2370229	2373030	And something like beat the shit out of me outside the base.
2373030	2375831	I was like, Okay, I wasn't supposed to be doing that yet.
2375831	2377472	So I have to kind of like start over I think.
2377992	2379292	So that's OK.
2379292	2380693	And I'll do that at some point.
2380693	2382513	But it's a very interesting start.
2382513	2385314	And I think this is catching a lot of people's attention right now.
2385314	2390075	Now, Loki, you had said last week, being in the Minecraft community, there's a lot of eyes on this, right?
2390075	2393756	Yeah, there is a lot of the people that stream Minecraft stuff.
2393756	2397376	Normally, we're all trying it out because it looked interesting.
2397376	2403038	So I haven't tried it out yet, but I mean, the gameplay videos looked interesting.
2403038	2404418	It's certainly not as
2406141	2412653	It's not as in-depth as Minecraft in the sense that you can't build absolutely anything.
2412653	2413855	It's kind of just like...
2415375	2417236	It's like Fortnite building, in a sense.
2417236	2418957	You can build walls and stuff like that.
2418957	2423080	Maybe you can change what those walls look like, but it's very limited.
2423080	2426922	You're not going brick by brick and doing all that stuff.
2426922	2429503	Which is fine, because sometimes it may be overwhelming for a lot of people.
2429503	2433165	They just want to build... I want to build a castle-looking thing.
2433165	2436827	I don't want to think about which blocks I should use, what makes it look good, and stuff.
2436827	2438688	I just want to do that.
2438688	2441430	And that's fine, because there's lots of other games, like Rust or...
2444551	2459163	Gosh, there's other survival games like that, I think maybe The Forest as well, where you don't necessarily have the individual brick by brick building, it's just building walls and stuff.
2459163	2461465	It's more accessible that way, I think.
2462861	2466884	Plus people like seeing their Fortnite skins as LEGO characters, and that's also fun.
2466884	2469065	Oh, but not Ariana Grande.
2469065	2470826	Only some of them are LEGO characters.
2470826	2473528	I think some of the big licenses are not LEGO characters.
2473528	2485516	But I will admit, I loved having in Fortnite Festival the fact that Ariana Grande could be in my band and actually play guitar to Lady Gaga is really funny.
2485516	2488078	So that part I enjoyed.
2489959	2492621	DarkTutsu in chat says I would be curious about the racing mode.
2492621	2495624	Yeah, that's on my radar to check out.
2495624	2497665	I just didn't get around to it yet.
2497665	2502389	So the Rocket League folks made Rocket Racing, which is now available in the Fortnite portal.
2502389	2512116	So Fortnite definitely made a calculated effort before this holiday season to launch some attention-grabbing original content that is not Battle Royale.
2514258	2515379	Seems to be working.
2515379	2516340	At least it did on me.
2516340	2518001	So it'll be interesting.
2518001	2523466	It reminds me a lot of like Grand Theft Auto Online, actually, because there's a lot of Grand Theft Auto Online stuff.
2523466	2530211	Like you may remember they have there's like, OK, so Grand Theft Auto Online, you can do like the whole crime stuff.
2530211	2531072	You can do
2532950	2533811	Thanks for watching!
2551409	2553510	With a couple people, you can do that as well.
2553510	2558033	So they're kind of catering stuff like, hey, I don't like Battle Royale, but I like racing.
2558033	2560674	And then now you're on their platform and you may play something else.
2560674	2562015	Or, hey, I don't like you.
2562015	2563396	I like music.
2563396	2564056	I'm going to play that.
2564056	2564196	100%.
2564196	2565457	That's the strategy.
2565457	2565737	That's it.
2567438	2594112	you got to appeal to the people that like things other than shooters and they got me for now anyway I don't know how long the festival you know will last but it does kind of make me think there's going to be more there's going to be more along these lines whether it's by themselves but we know that Fortnite has opened its platform to other people creating original games and content so it's going to be very interesting to see what happens long term with this but this is a heck of a start I will say that um
2595464	2597185	what else I want to say about the Fortnite stuff?
2597185	2622097	Oh, I wanted to say a very interesting kind of observation too, if you look at Epic Games and their history, like this is a weird full circle moment in a way for me and you know, observing, because obviously, you know, being the old men, Loki and I are and I only include Loki because we've we've reminisced about this game on the show before, is we used to play the shit out of a game called ZZT when we were like, what, how old?
2622097	2623938	By ZZT Universe.
2623938	2624118	Yeah.
2624998	2642344	And ZZT, for those that don't remember this game, ZZT was a game that, like, it was all done in ASCII art, and it was an adventure game that you could go around to do things, but it had the ZZT OOP, or Object Oriented Programming Language, and you could build your own ZZT maps.
2642864	2643044	ZZT
2660455	2665017	They had, they used to have a thing for people that were interested in ZZTV.
2665017	2672139	They had these levels that people made that they're basically like programming examples of like how to implement some like really wild things.
2672139	2677121	And one of those was like a first person maze type simulation thing.
2677121	2680382	I don't know if it was the first person shooter, but it was like a maze type thing.
2680382	2683543	And like later on, like other games, you know.
2683543	2687985	Sorry, I was thinking shooter more like centipede type of thing.
2687985	2688745	That type of shooter game.
2689730	2701003	I mean, there was shooting in ZZT, but yeah, I don't know about like actually like FPS, but yeah, you could do some pretty wild stuff with that.
2701003	2708953	And then, you know, it was also the other thing, too, is like their main game or whatever the game that came with it.
2709774	2712657	is like kind of a tutorial on how to build stuff as well.
2712657	2717502	So they had like a it was really exciting to be able to like just make your own things out of it.
2717502	2720845	It was really easy because it's just, you know, drawing with characters.
2720845	2723148	And then if you wanted to program stuff, cool.
2723148	2727633	If you didn't want to program stuff, you could just throw down enemies and just do whatever.
2727633	2731617	But like you really get in depth with it and do some crazy stuff if you wanted to.
2731917	2736258	So the funny thing is, is that for me, this almost feels like a full circle moment.
2736258	2742420	And you can when you consider, you know, Tim Sweeney is the president of Epic, CEO, and he made ZZT, right?
2742420	2743440	Like that.
2743440	2744440	He made that game.
2744440	2745781	So bring it back.
2745781	2746861	Yeah.
2746861	2748961	For all the talks that, you know, there's a lot to see.
2748961	2750422	And I want to make this clear.
2750422	2752862	I don't particularly care for Tim Sweeney.
2752862	2754663	A lot of the crap he says on social media.
2754663	2756103	And I wish he'd stop using it.
2756103	2758504	But, you know, so I certainly don't.
2759244	2760425	Agree with him on a lot of stuff.
2760425	2767290	I'm not exactly going to put him up on too high of a pedestal or what have you.
2767290	2774756	But ZZT was a very important game, especially for me growing up and it's very interesting to see this come full circle.
2775737	2782681	where now it's like, oh, now Fortnite is that game that has a base game, but you can program your own game in it.
2782681	2788965	It's a lot harder, but you can program your own game in it, and now it's becoming more than just the game that it was originally.
2788965	2793168	It's a very interesting, huh, kind of moment in games, for sure.
2794088	2798210	So anyway, I'll be curious how many of you I noticed in chat.
2798210	2803572	Bonds006 in chat says Robin Loki making a good argument for me to play Lego Fortnite.
2803572	2808133	I mean, I mean, it's we're not like you're not committing to like playing it forever.
2808133	2809274	You just testing it out.
2809274	2810054	It's free.
2810054	2810394	Why not?
2810394	2812235	I mean, I need to go try it out.
2812235	2812415	Yeah.
2812415	2812655	Yeah.
2812655	2814236	I don't want to sound like a shill.
2814236	2816136	Maybe maybe we need an influencer code.
2816136	2816516	I don't know.
2816516	2819798	I don't want to sound like a shill, but at the same time, it's free.
2820677	2822679	What do you got to lose besides bandwidth?
2822679	2825241	If that's a concern for you, like, that's it.
2825241	2826142	Just don't give it money.
2826142	2826802	There you go.
2826802	2828104	And it's you can check it out.
2828104	2829945	So yeah, Fortnite's free.
2829945	2831126	And so the festival's free.
2831126	2834489	I mean, there will be plenty of opportunity for them to take your money.
2834489	2838493	But if you never input your credit card number, they can't take your money.
2838493	2840575	So something to think about.
2840575	2840795	Anyway.
2841601	2846042	All right, let's move on and get into some news of the week.
2846042	2850244	I was trying to think if I had any programming announcements.
2850244	2851264	I don't right now.
2851264	2855766	I still need to work with you folks off air on what the holidays are going to look like.
2855766	2860807	But until we're there, let's just move on with the news and we will get into it.
2860807	2864849	So Loki, I mean, all this talk of the Game Awards and all this other stuff.
2866269	2872113	totally forgot there's another kind of big deal thing that happened this week, especially in your world.
2872113	2874074	I know you want to talk about this, Loki.
2874074	2876776	Let's talk about the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer.
2876776	2885282	Finally, it was released early even because it leaked out because, you know, that's how we roll nowadays is leaks, leaks, leaks.
2885282	2892847	But yeah, it's definitely been viewed by a lot of people setting records as one of the most viewed videos, I think.
2893707	2895888	in 24 hours.
2895888	2897948	Yeah, they had quite a few.
2897948	2903530	It beat out Mr. Beast at 59.4 million.
2903530	2906230	And I don't remember what the total amount was.
2906230	2909171	I think it was like 100 million people viewed that.
2909171	2910752	It was a lot.
2912813	2915477	Yeah, 100 million views in 24 hours.
2915477	2918141	So it was incredible.
2918141	2922888	Especially when you consider that they had to release it early because of the leak.
2922888	2925672	They still were able to shatter, you know, all these records.
2927122	2927943	Exactly.
2927943	2930104	And what I think of it, it looks incredible.
2930104	2934487	It is unfortunately going to be a long wait until 2025 for when it comes out.
2934487	2940251	But I mean, it is it is going to be groundbreaking as far as visuals go.
2940251	2946375	And I mean, just even the animations, everything are just it's ridiculous to see how far they pushed it.
2946375	2948577	A little disappointed that it's only a console.
2948577	2950718	Thankfully, I do have a console that can play it.
2950718	2953580	So like that, that is a good thing, at least.
2954961	2964709	but yeah, it's important to say it's only on console for now because they know people are going to double dip so they can mod it when it's on PC.
2964709	2966110	I know that's what's going to happen.
2966110	2972535	Yeah, but it is going to be the first Grand Theft Auto with a female protagonist, which is interesting.
2972535	2978080	So we know of two protagonists right now in that kind of almost like a Bonnie and Clyde type thing.
2978080	2978981	So it's funny.
2978981	2979521	That's funny.
2979521	2981323	The leak a few months ago said the same thing.
2982455	2984236	Well, I mean, it was gameplay.
2984236	2987036	So yeah, I would imagine that it's accurate.
2987036	2993318	I want to know what this Instagram or TikTok parody stuff is because they have this full on like Instagram parody stuff.
2993318	2995759	And I'm like, dang, this looks really funny.
2995759	3001040	And like the guy in the thong watering his lawn and like just all and all of it is based off of real videos, too.
3001040	3002861	Well, and like they're all like inspired by them.
3003041	3013518	Okay, because if Grand Theft Auto is based, excuse me, if Vice City is based off of Miami, then you have to have Florida residents featured in the game.
3014890	3016171	Sorry, TigerClaw.
3016171	3018673	Sorry, TigerClaw and all our other people that live in Florida.
3018673	3020214	But you know, it's true.
3020214	3020974	You know, it's true.
3020974	3023236	Yeah.
3023236	3026978	And then, of course, you know, along with that, of course, 100 million people seeing it.
3026978	3036845	You know, it also boosted Love is a Long Road by Tom Petty because, you know, people listen to the trailer songs all the time.
3036845	3044190	And he says it's basically increased the Spotify streams by 37,000 percent compared to last week.
3044930	3046150	So that's a lot.
3046150	3050292	He'll get two more nickels this month.
3050292	3051832	What else?
3051832	3065357	Yeah, so basically we were talking about how it's confirmed for just PlayStation 5 and Xbox X and S. I would not be surprised if it's just X only because I don't think it can run on S.
3066776	3069457	I probably it probably is just a lower resolution.
3069457	3073419	It probably only runs at 720 on S. Yeah, we'll see.
3073419	3074740	I would not be surprised, though.
3074740	3082244	I would not be surprised if we get to that point and Microsoft goes, Listen, not everything is going to be compatible on both systems, but we'll see.
3082244	3082624	I don't know.
3082624	3084365	Maybe I could be wrong.
3084365	3092128	But yeah, it is going to be a a long way, but I am very excited to see what they do with it.
3092128	3093029	It looks incredible.
3094403	3099246	Yeah, I mean, like, you know, I don't super get into Grand Theft Auto games the same way everybody else does.
3099246	3107890	But you can't look at that and go, wow, the graphics in this, the graphics in this are fucking stunning.
3107890	3112332	Like just like the amount of like pedestrians and stuff like they were showing.
3112332	3119596	I mean, it's not like an even example, but they were showing like, you know, Spider-Man 2, which just came out and their beaches are completely empty.
3119596	3120597	I mean, obviously, it's
3122138	3128124	I think that takes place around Christmas time anyways, or in the winter, so why would people be on the beaches?
3128124	3130487	It's not only the variety of the player models.
3139216	3149548	The density of the different people on the beaches, just everything going on, like all of the animals, just like crazy amounts of everything in there.
3149548	3153213	And it's only gonna get better by the time we get to it.
3153213	3154194	Like that's the thing.
3154194	3156697	So it's gonna be very cool to see.
3158553	3165118	Alright, well 2025, it's quite a wait, but that's if they make it.
3165118	3166459	2025 could get delayed, right?
3166459	3167219	We'll see.
3167219	3167860	Hopefully not.
3167860	3169821	I mean, you know what?
3169821	3170341	It's fine.
3170341	3171022	Take your time.
3171022	3172363	Cause like, honestly, it's gonna be great.
3175234	3182695	All right, well, this is gonna come out a lot sooner than Grand Theft Auto VI, I'm sure.
3182695	3186936	Although I guess we don't necessarily have a guarantee on that, but I think we'll see this soon.
3186936	3189016	It is the next Gold Master Series game.
3189016	3197018	So I've been talking about this a little bit because I really enjoyed Gold Master Series 1, which of course is Digital Eclipse, I guess now Atari in a way.
3197018	3203699	They're really thorough Criterion Edition type walkthroughs of gaming history.
3204339	3219227	and 001 was the making of Karateka, which was a great, you know, again, if you haven't checked it out yet, even if you don't care for Karateka, I just think the way it's set up as a museum, I think it's really well done and really worth your time as an exhibit to look at and check out.
3219227	3221889	And we've been curious what game is 2 going to be?
3221889	3223430	What game is 2 going to be?
3223430	3227292	And as it turns out, plot twist, 2 is not going to be a game.
3228109	3230312	Goldmaster Series 2 is Llamasoft, the Jeff Minter Story
3247273	3248974	There's of course going to be a Switch version.
3248974	3250974	It'll be on all the consoles.
3250974	3263379	And this is, you know, they say, Jeff Minter, weird, wild, 42 games from eight different platforms, including the Sinclair ZX81, the Commodore VIC-20,
3264219	3277053	The Commodore 64, where you can play things like Mama Llama, Hellgate, Gridrunner was one of his big games, Attack of the Mutant Camels, Revenge of the Mutant Camels, 1 and 2, Sheep in Space, you know, these are all.
3277053	3279095	You get Sinclair Spectrum games.
3279095	3280717	You get Atari 8-bit games.
3280717	3283500	Again, Gridrunner, Attack of the Mutant Camels.
3283500	3285342	This is the really cool thing.
3285842	3288784	You get to play Konix Multi System.
3288784	3290486	That hardware never came out.
3290486	3291567	It was canceled.
3291567	3295950	But on the Konix Multi System, you will get to play Attack of the Mutant Camels 89.
3295950	3298292	So that's rad right there.
3298292	3302935	On the Atari ST, Llamatron 2112, Revenge of the Mutant Camels, Super Grid Runner.
3302935	3313123	And then one double dip from Atari 50, because Jeff Minter was a huge part of, Tempest 2000, and why that game was, you know, as unique as it was.
3313123	3315005	So you will get that in this collection.
3315625	3316345	as well.
3316345	3318846	So it is a double dip, but I'm totally okay with it.
3318846	3321567	What?
3321567	3322027	What?
3322027	3322668	Recharge.
3322668	3323188	Yes.
3323188	3325088	Super Zapper Recharge.
3325088	3326389	I love that game.
3326389	3328570	I was playing that at Atari 50 the other day.
3328570	3332831	I have yet to fire up Atari 50 with the extra games, but we'll get to that later.
3332831	3333451	But anyway.
3333451	3335392	A little aside.
3335392	3336032	A little aside.
3336032	3336933	Yeah.
3336933	3339934	Every time either Dan and I grab the cat, we go, got you.
3339934	3341094	The other one of us goes, ah!
3342870	3343390	It's true.
3343390	3347791	Yeah, no, which is a play on Tempest 2000 for those that don't know.
3347791	3351092	Yeah, no, this is this is going to be a great collection.
3351092	3353353	I'm really excited about it.
3353353	3355854	They also do reimagined games.
3355854	3359075	So you might remember that in the making of Karateka- First level music is stuck in my head now.
3360175	3361735	Light Synthesizers, Psychedelia, and ColorSpace.
3361735	3363276	Fully playable with all new console controls.
3391960	3392901	Shroom's not included.
3421852	3427298	We knew this coming out, but we didn't know too much about it.
3427298	3429881	We still don't know too much about it.
3429881	3438330	So, Behavior Interactive, the makers of Dead by Daylight and Supermassive Games are making a baby.
3438330	3441674	A really hideous, bloody, gappy baby.
3444188	3453076	What we had known before was that there was going to be a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe outside of the Entity's realm.
3453076	3456339	But we didn't know that much about it.
3456339	3461443	So it was sort of like realm adjacent.
3461443	3468629	What we are getting is a game called The Casting of Frank Stone.
3468629	3469410	And I mean,
3470845	3481652	Oh, the guy, his full get up in the trailer just gives me the vibes of what I call the Trapper's Moltar outfit.
3481652	3494441	It's an old school welding helmet, you know, very Moltar from Space Ghost, you know, and with chains around them and a leather apron and all of this and apparently some crazy murderer.
3495493	3509660	The website is pretty neat because you go through and you click on little clues on the main page and it walks you through just a little hint of the story.
3509660	3515043	There's the trailer, and I swore one of the people I thought was Meg, but it's not Meg.
3515043	3519745	No, none of the characters from DBD are in this trailer.
3519745	3524188	I know, but it was Meg hair.
3524188	3525008	Maybe it's her mom.
3526784	3540993	Anyway, um, the, the trailer starts off with, um, and, and I do think that, that people should, you know, go spend a little time to watch it.
3540993	3546337	Um, but it starts off sort of like a film strip with the film grain.
3546337	3555302	And it seems almost like it's set maybe in the seventies or early eighties.
3555302	3555943	Impression, Rob?
3557219	3560261	Ah, yeah, I could see that.
3560261	3562503	It's hard to tell from the little blip that we saw, but I could see that.
3562503	3575452	Like, um... ...found a steel mill, and these four individuals are walking into it.
3575452	3580996	And yeah, I agree with SSJ100, Matt, it gives me a Grindhouse feel to it.
3580996	3585860	But they go in, and then they're caught up in whatever happens.
3588126	3603413	I mean, I have a feeling that if the vehicles didn't give me a proper clue as to the age of the game, that I think that maybe some are flashbacks that might have been set in the 70s or 80s.
3603413	3608435	We have a modern group going into the abandoned shutdown mill from what it looks like.
3610083	3615104	looking in, oh, it's Cedar Steel Corporation.
3615104	3626308	Now, one thing that I think is interesting is in looking through some of these screenshots, there is an industrial generator in one of the pictures that seems very reminiscent of Dead by Daylight.
3626308	3632329	Yeah, I noticed the hooker or something like that, too, in the trailer that they had.
3632329	3635230	I don't know if that matters.
3635230	3638571	I'm sorry, it's cutting out because I'm still having RAM leaks.
3639409	3644911	Oh, I was gonna say, I noticed that they also showed the hook from Dead by Daylight in the trailer as well.
3644911	3650533	So, I mean, it's like, oh, hey, Tamsin, it relates.
3650533	3654214	The meat hooks are definitely there.
3654214	3664998	Now, I have theories, because the last scene of the trailer, or one of the last ones,
3666331	3669713	giant spider leg coming out of the sky.
3669713	3676856	And we know that the entity is made up of 120% spider legs.
3676856	3677537	I have a theory.
3677537	3682479	I have a theory about about the story.
3682479	3683279	You'll see if I'm right.
3683279	3686561	Yeah, go for it, please.
3686561	3689803	I believe the entity was dormant.
3689803	3690383	Sort of dormant.
3692748	3694330	The Hellmouth from Buffy
3712814	3723722	Basically, the entity took and went to, you know, go through time and space and dimension and grab victims.
3723722	3732929	I mean, I think maybe it was doing something a little bit different before, but the modern iteration, I think could have been this Frank guy's influence.
3732929	3733630	Interesting.
3733630	3735591	So, yes.
3735591	3737333	Well, we'll see in 2024 when the game comes out.
3737333	3740455	Or maybe it's what brought the entity to our world.
3740455	3740695	Maybe.
3743715	3746878	Alright, well, I'm curious to check this game out.
3746878	3752604	I have to admit, I like Until Dawn and the Quarry, although I watch people play them.
3752604	3758651	I haven't played them myself, so I'll be curious to check this one out and see how much it...
3759051	3760412	I will play the hell out of this.
3760412	3766917	I'm wondering if they don't end up putting this killer because he just he looks like he could be the welder a new killer in Dead by Daylight.
3766917	3778807	So I wonder if they don't end up putting him in DVD anyway as like a crossover or if that would be a weird like like they're they're very intentionally trying to preserve the boundary between this game and Dead by Daylight.
3778807	3779347	I don't know.
3779347	3783931	Be interesting to see.
3783931	3785472	All right.
3785472	3788054	Well, we I would also think
3792204	3815025	A narrative game that has to do with a survivor support group like people who have found evidence about their loved ones over the last I'd say maybe 50 to 60 years who have gone missing you know and this is kind of based off a fanfic that I read that I really like because like
3816257	3832900	In the story, they had all the survivors coming in kind of in release order and Meg losing her shit when Jane Romero shows up, who was, you know, very famous when Meg was still, you know, who had, quote, died when Meg was, you know, a younger, a younger girl.
3834649	3841472	or Jeff recognizing the Legion kids because he went to school with them.
3841472	3852457	Just starting to put it together, but I would think that for the people who were still going on with actual chronological time, they have an investigation game.
3855478	3856019	Interesting.
3856019	3859564	Well, we'll, again, we'll we'll see when the game comes out.
3859564	3861928	How everything relates together.
3861928	3863090	All right.
3863090	3867337	Um, let's move on and get to our next story, which is quite the bummer, Loki.
3868350	3887751	Yeah, so Nintendo has decided to cancel its major event in Japan, so Nintendo Live 2024 Tokyo has been postponed, or at least, I don't think it's outright canceled, but they've postponed it to an unspecified date yet, because of course, people being the
3888649	3904827	beacons of responsibility that they are they decided to go ahead and have death threats or threats against Nintendo employees and spectators and so because of that they had to postpone the event because
3905953	3907255	Thanks for watching!
3923527	3937994	some people's children it's it's really unfortunate it's ridiculous yeah i i don't blame them for doing it but it's it sucks that you know they they have to take this abundance of caution in the first place because people can't you know can't have nice things that's it yeah
3939927	3950075	All right, well, let's move on to talking about a little bit of good news, especially if you own the Atari 50 collection, which I brought up a little bit earlier.
3950075	3956640	But we mentioned on last week's show that the game was going to be getting a free holiday update, and that update did hit this week.
3956640	3957661	So we actually know
3958061	3964605	What free additional games came to Atari 50, which include Adventure 2, which was a homebrew.
3964605	3969347	Bowling, Double Dunk, Maze Craze, Miniature Golf, Moto Rodeo.
3969347	3970988	Those were all for the 2600.
3970988	3973770	And then there was Aquaventure and Save Mary.
3973770	3976271	Those are also prototypes of the 2600.
3976271	3977232	Super Football for the 2600.
3978112	3983537	Circus Atari for 2600 and Return to Haunted House, which is also a homebrew for the 2600.
3983537	3987340	So there are some original things like the types of things you would have seen.
3987340	3992164	I think some of the flashbacks, I know one of the flashback consoles had Adventure 2 for sure.
3992164	3997949	Also, even though pretty much all of them were 2600, there is a single Lynx game that they added.
3997949	4000812	Warbirds was also added to the collection as well.
4000812	4002594	So that's, that's kind of fun.
4002594	4003795	So I don't think I played that one.
4003795	4004015	Yeah.
4004555	4012703	Um, but yeah, if you have, yeah, if you have the Atari 50 collection, this is something you can pick up now, which is pretty cool.
4012703	4016968	I did not get around to it this week, but I'm looking forward to checking it out at some point.
4016968	4020191	And I love that it's just free.
4020191	4022934	We love the low price of free.
4022934	4027318	All right, moving on, DarkSakura.
4027318	4027718	It doesn't.
4030223	4040225	So, this is what I was referring to when I was agreeing with Rob about children.
4040225	4051788	First of all, Activision, Epic, and other video game developers, including Roblox, are being hit with a lawsuit because
4054389	4060770	A nine-year-old became addicted to games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto.
4060770	4067612	It was filed in Chicago federal court on December 6th, so a few days ago for us.
4067612	4075133	It said that video game addiction is, and I'll quote, an epidemic harming our nation's youth.
4075133	4081655	I need to send in things to Bloomberg because Bloomberg has a typo in their article.
4081655	4081935	Anyway.
4084011	4095779	feedback loops and reward systems that ensure maximal playing time by young users.
4095779	4107226	They go into microtransactions, they go psychology behind it, you know, using behavioral psychology,
4110525	4116149	This complaint sounds like it's written like a tweet more, a tweet longer.
4116149	4117770	I'm just going to read this.
4117770	4129418	The schemes use psychological mechanisms, behavioral psychology, and neuroscience to encourage repeated play and increase spending among users, especially among vulnerable populations like minors.
4129418	4132700	They use those terms like they just don't know what they mean.
4135501	4138462	A lot of these could be wrapped up.
4138462	4143444	Anyway, that's, um, I don't like poorly worded things.
4143444	4160031	Um, the, uh, the nine-year-old in question who goes by DG, this is another quote, experienced severe emotional distress, diminished social interactions, loss of friends, poor hygiene, and withdrawal symptoms such as rage, anger, and physical outbursts.
4160031	4165093	That he was playing, uh, six to eight hours a day across multiple platforms.
4167023	4170564	that other kids were having some of the same issues.
4170564	4189988	You know, the companies are patenting more technology to deceive and harm society's most vulnerable, being minors, while lining their own pockets.
4189988	4190289	Yeah.
4195800	4209486	They also say that claims that say otherwise are not rooted in fact and ignore the reality that billions of people globally of all ages and backgrounds enjoy playing video games and do so in a healthy, balanced way.
4209486	4210366	First of all,
4212475	4214456	Angelili vs Activision Blizzard Inc.
4228365	4247281	There, there's a, um, there were other attorney, uh, their attorneys also, uh, file, well, their law firm, sorry, uh, Bullock Ward Mason LLC filed, uh, other addiction suits in Arkansas against the same defendants, uh, about a month or so ago.
4247281	4251785	Okay.
4251785	4252986	I have, I have thoughts.
4252986	4255849	Number one, dear parent.
4259144	4268268	Who was it that set their kid in front of the video game system and decided it was going to become their babysitter?
4268268	4274251	Who was it that didn't set up boundaries to begin with?
4274251	4277132	Who is responsible for your child?
4277132	4277412	It's you!
4282622	4303456	I understand that one expects the companies to have some sort of, you know, warning or maybe something like that, but I'm going to use an extreme analogy here, so hear me out.
4303456	4306819	When there is a firearm in the house,
4308818	4313561	Does anybody know what you're supposed to do with a firearm to make it safe?
4313561	4314362	Give it to the cat.
4314362	4316623	Oh, no?
4316623	4317303	You give it to the cat.
4317303	4320485	Chuckle it in the air.
4320485	4322447	You make sure the safety is on.
4322447	4325629	You put it in a locker.
4325629	4327370	Okay.
4327370	4334174	If you leave this under your pillow with the safety off, and someone comes in and...
4335000	4337781	puts their head on your pillow and it shoots them in the head.
4337781	4339262	I'm just throwing that out.
4339262	4342483	Who's at fault there?
4342483	4349426	The person at fault is the person that left the gun out, with the safety off, under a fucking pillow.
4349426	4352327	Alright, extreme analogy, right?
4352327	4354628	But I think it still goes in line.
4355638	4363243	Yeah, the video game companies, you know, a lot of them do have a warning that come up, have rating systems on them.
4363243	4368567	I think they are now required to say if they involve transactions, right?
4368567	4371849	I think so, yeah.
4371849	4376592	So then they have done what they need to do.
4378692	4386119	And of course, the point of their side of the industry is to make money.
4386119	4387400	It's capitalism.
4387400	4392985	It's to make an entertaining thing that people are going to want to play and keep playing, right?
4392985	4400091	So whose responsibility is it that brings this device into the house?
4400091	4403534	Let's not set safety protocols for it.
4405711	4412533	Yeah, I'm surprised my parents didn't sue Nickelodeon under these same guidelines, because I sat there for hours and hours and watched Nickelodeon growing up.
4412533	4413073	But you know what?
4413073	4413933	I turned out okay.
4413933	4419375	And there was a point, all joking aside, where my parents did set boundaries with that stuff, as parents should do.
4419375	4425936	This is a frivolous lawsuit that just shows you everything that's wrong with the legal system in this country.
4425936	4430638	The law office that's bringing this up should honestly have their legal license revoked.
4430638	4431858	It's that frivolous.
4431858	4434719	Why are we allowing these fucking serial
4435239	4440802	for profit, people that file these things, these, you know, legal things to continue to flourish.
4440802	4441982	It's bullshit.
4441982	4445424	You know, like laugh this out of court the way it ought to be.
4445424	4448645	And, you know, make an example of this fucking legal team.
4448645	4452107	And I whatever about the parent, they are being used.
4452107	4453688	It is the lawyer's fault.
4453688	4457970	The family is being used by these legal folks.
4457970	4459771	Let's let's be 100% clear about that.
4459771	4460591	That is what's happening.
4462646	4467892	But I'm sure that the parent had to have sought legal action to begin with.
4467892	4470936	So the parent walked right into it.
4470936	4476583	They denied their own personal responsibility and are letting themselves be taken advantage of because of it.
4476583	4477664	So they're both to blame.
4477664	4479806	And they see dollar signs.
4479806	4482530	Because I'm sure they've been sweet talked into how much they stand to make.
4482530	4482710	Yeah.
4484218	4489621	Well, I'm not I'm not going to take any of that off of off of the parents.
4489621	4494004	I am not going to deny them of the responsibility they have for getting themselves in that situation.
4494004	4494464	No, sure.
4494464	4499847	At the end of the day, they are when you when you give away your morals to get into an immoral situation.
4499847	4500948	Yeah, you are responsible.
4500948	4501488	So, yeah, I do.
4501488	4502228	I do agree.
4502228	4504029	They are not absolved of any responsibility.
4504029	4508612	I'm just saying it's the law office is ought to have ramifications here, too.
4508612	4511694	And they won't.
4511694	4511794	And.
4513291	4515252	Well, and here's the other thing, too.
4515252	4522877	Almost the same thing that they're accusing the video game companies of, that's what the attorneys are doing to them, right?
4522877	4524658	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
4524658	4525338	You know?
4525338	4532142	They think that this is gonna make them, you know, a tipper gore or something, you know?
4532142	4542729	And get them the big media attention and, you know... I have a lot of thoughts about this as well, simply because
4544904	4547966	There's something that they're not also taking into account.
4547966	4549568	Yeah, they say kids are vulnerable.
4549568	4553671	Do you know why kids are vulnerable to stuff like this?
4553671	4561637	Especially playing a game that is for all intents and purposes under their age range.
4561637	4565720	Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, nine years old.
4565720	4568562	So here's the other factor about that.
4568562	4572405	This child is not the target audience for these games.
4572405	4573586	Okay.
4573586	4574147	Second of all,
4575408	4597439	And this has actually been shown, now it, this is just psychologically, chemically speaking, it lasts longer in typical males than it does in females and, you know, assigned at birth who were physically assigned that at birth, because that's part of chemistry.
4597439	4600360	Is it the way that the mind is wired?
4600360	4604282	When you are a child, it is wired for instant gratification.
4605356	4617384	You know, if you're going to say, hey, do you want this ice cream or do you want to save the ice cream money and go get, you know, a Super Nintendo later?
4617384	4619166	I just threw it out there.
4619166	4624349	A nine year old kid is probably going to say, no, I want the ice cream, you know, or I want them both.
4624349	4626070	Can I have them both?
4626070	4626591	To be honest.
4627905	4633910	And the turnover of that starts phasing out when you hit your teens.
4633910	4642938	And for most males, the top of the age range is about 27.
4642938	4643899	For females, it's about 24.
4643899	4646781	Not too much of a difference off.
4646781	4651185	But it has to deal with the way that the brain is wired.
4651185	4652707	That's all it is.
4652707	4655069	And if you have a child,
4655945	4667502	who is wired for instant gratification playing a game that is not meant for their age, well of course you're going to have a problem, you know?
4670756	4672338	I could go into the psychology.
4672338	4675220	This is part of something I've written a paper on.
4675220	4677382	I doubt anyone listening disagrees.
4677382	4683087	It's just one of those things where you just shake your head and go, what a colossal waste of fucking time.
4683087	4684648	And it's just, it's unfortunate.
4684648	4691734	And I'm sorry, I really was trying to avoid being insensitive and bringing up biological factors.
4691734	4695257	So by all means, that was not my intention.
4695257	4695858	I was trying to
4696761	4698922	to speak about biological wiring
4719228	4722010	What happens when you sell stuff on consignment?
4740003	4740944	Exactly.
4740944	4745128	Well, it's funny though, when you read the comments and they're like, what the hell are you talking about?
4745128	4751994	Like, if anything, they're pushing more, you know, competition anyways, because on PC, there's multiple platforms.
4751994	4756178	Hell, even within Steam, you can get codes in multiple different places at different prices.
4756178	4759261	Like, oh God, it's so stupid.
4759261	4760222	It's so dumb.
4760222	4760482	I get it.
4761369	4769091	I never once gave humanity credit for having mass intelligence.
4769091	4776753	It's a handful that I think... I'm gonna just stop there, it makes me sad.
4776753	4782115	Alright, well let's move on and talk about what's apparently going on at Bungie, Loki.
4782856	4797172	Yeah, so Bungie apparently hasn't been selling enough of those, whatever the equivalent of money is on the Destiny platform, because they are 45% below their 2023 forecast.
4797172	4802738	And as part of the deal when Sony had acquired Bungie,
4803358	4808460	They were going to remain an independent subsidiary, assuming they could hit those targets.
4808460	4814162	And so now, being that they are falling well below those targets, there is the...
4815851	4833040	I don't know, threat the possibility or real possibility that Sony is going to take them over, get rid of the board and basically run the company as their own instead of allowing them to maintain independence.
4833040	4838663	Along with that, though, is more of a cost cutting and cost savings.
4838663	4839744	The company has been
4840868	4855356	They put themselves in a hiring freeze, they have crackdown on annual cost of living adjustments to salaries, no holiday bonuses, as well as layoffs.
4855356	4860658	And so this will only continue until, I guess, they get things under control.
4860658	4863420	And of course, that isn't great for morale.
4863420	4865061	But, you know.
4865772	4871957	Um, perhaps I need more education on the subject from, you know, people that actually work there and so forth.
4871957	4883104	However, there is a part of me that kind of goes, well, after Bungie laid off those folks, and again, it's never, you know, the hires up to hear that Sony is about to come in and lay off the board.
4884105	4887989	actually kind of sounds like sweet justice to me, uh, in a way.
4887989	4900920	And I, I failed to sit here and see how, well, that's, you know, I, but I do get morale, you know, and I wouldn't want to see, and I wouldn't want to see folks that are on the front lines be affected, which in this type of situation might be.
4900920	4902001	I'd want to be very clear.
4902001	4905785	It's only this part where I'm like, oh, well, if they're going to come in and sack the board,
4906405	4911748	Yeah, I would think that yeah, I would think the morale is not coming from the sacking of the board.
4911748	4916490	I think it's more of the layoffs and the lack of of salary and payments and bonuses.
4916490	4921512	I don't think they could give a damn about which are all reasons why maybe the board ought to be sacked.
4921512	4922192	Exactly.
4922192	4922873	I would agree.
4922873	4927595	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens here.
4927595	4927835	But
4928962	4933444	I mean, you know, if it's under poor direction, then maybe that's the way they got to go.
4933444	4937225	Just like I'm getting vibes of the Microsoft Activision merger.
4937225	4943367	Like, again, not a big fan of the big fish eating the other big fish, but like getting Bobby Kotick out.
4943991	4944151	which
4964477	4966258	Like Redfall was not great.
4966258	4977264	And so now I think Microsoft is going to be taking more of a more hand on approach with that studio and some of the stuff that they're doing versus kind of letting them do whatever.
4977264	4983568	By the way, since you brought that up, you know, they they showed up, that studio showed off the Blade trailer, which looked really ironic.
4983968	5007095	which I I'm not but what was what I thought was interesting about it they they mentioned oh it's from the creators of uh uh Deathloop and you know that they did not even mention Redfall they did not they wrote that one off boy I was like oh okay so yeah but the blade trailer looked good well it's funny though it's like it's like vampire vampire game with vampire game I mean
5007469	5009132	Yeah, I kinda thought that too.
5009132	5012558	I was like, so are they just like re-skinning Redfall?
5012558	5016224	I know they're not, but I thought it was... I also caught the similarities.
5019684	5022266	All right, well, we'll see what develops on the Bungie front.
5022266	5024608	This could be very interesting.
5024608	5028011	Meanwhile, going back to the Game Awards for a minute.
5028011	5033616	Look, y'all know at this point, if you've been listening to the show for a while, y'all know the types of games that I enjoy.
5033616	5037179	And one game that I really enjoy is No Man's Sky.
5037179	5042704	And we got to find out what is the next game that's coming from Hello Games, the creators of No Man's Sky.
5043144	5043505	Light No Fire
5058061	5061183	maybe on one planet as opposed to an entire galaxy.
5061183	5067866	Because I remember distinctly relating it to the third expedition of No Man's Sky, which did that.
5067866	5071048	It started on one planet and you had to do all these things on the planet.
5071048	5074229	It was a lot less focused on what you did in outer space.
5074229	5076631	And essentially, guess what?
5076631	5079272	Light No Fire is kind of that.
5079272	5081173	It takes place on one planet,
5081513	5103714	of course we don't really know everything because we see dragons in the trailer but we also see some more modern... it's like a fantasy earth I guess... yeah space looking things so we really don't really know everything but we definitely see some parallels to No Man's Sky as well the logo that you see towards the end looks a lot like the atlas from No Man's Sky so again I don't know if these games are directly related but
5104471	5106472	Fuck, this looks good.
5106472	5114416	And I'm really now again, of course, everybody is going, well, remember when No Man's Sky came out?
5114416	5117358	I would say, though, that they have this many years experience.
5117358	5118198	Exactly.
5118198	5119539	They're not going to.
5119539	5123141	Yeah, I think they're coming from a much different place now.
5123141	5128144	And I would expect that, you know, they they they had a very important label at the beginning.
5128144	5130225	And that said, it was captured all in game footage.
5130905	5132706	and a multiplayer and a multiplayer.
5132706	5137789	So and they've been working on this for five years, I think they said.
5137789	5146534	So I do feel like they have kept it in their pants, so to speak, a little better this time than maybe they did with No Man's Sky.
5146534	5150697	And a huge part of that is the fact that there's no Sony logo on this.
5151557	5155418	or Microsoft logo, to be fair, or any other company's logo on this.
5155418	5158458	Hello Games is going to produce this on their own.
5158458	5163359	And I think that's going to be a huge part of how they can avoid making the same mistake twice.
5163359	5167640	They didn't put a release date on it, so they're not, you know, backed in anything yet.
5167640	5169541	So we'll see.
5169541	5171161	The graphics looked incredible.
5171161	5175662	So I imagine it must be a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series game.
5175662	5176782	PC, it has to be.
5177502	5187070	I don't know if it will be Switch, but if Hello Games maybe got their hands on a Switch 2, maybe they're looking at that instead.
5187070	5189452	So, you know, it's still a long ways out.
5189452	5191254	But yeah, as a No Man's Sky fan,
5193424	5195125	This trailer was hot.
5195125	5196226	I was very happy to see it.
5196226	5197346	It was a hot trailer.
5197346	5198427	I was very happy to see it.
5198427	5200668	So I'm excited to check it out.
5200668	5205791	But you know what, Sean Murray and everybody at Hello Games, take the time to get it right.
5205791	5208473	It is all good.
5208473	5211815	They also inserted a little footnote in there too at the Game Awards.
5211815	5215136	They're not done updating No Man's Sky either.
5215136	5217398	And they showed just a brief little clip.
5217398	5222561	And it looked like the base that the ship was flying out of was way different than anything we've seen in the game yet.
5223181	5228589	So there's there's still improvements they're making to No Man's Sky as well.
5228589	5231613	And I think that's important to point out.
5231613	5234417	Questbuster in chat says, I just hope it will be fun.
5234417	5236440	You know what?
5236440	5237782	Video games ought to be fun.
5237782	5239464	And I agree, you know, as much as I
5240518	5243159	Stan No Man's Sky at this point.
5243159	5246020	I agree if the game's not fun, I don't want to play it.
5246020	5248420	But I'm I'm it sure looks pretty.
5248420	5255262	It looks fun for my brain and my audio visual senses like ooh, pretty and flying.
5255262	5261144	So Questmaster says as a side note, all No Man's Sky expeditions are running this month in case anyone missed any.
5262579	5264420	I missed that announcement.
5264420	5266442	Oh my gosh, do you have a link to more details?
5266442	5268163	Is it on a schedule?
5268163	5269744	I know I'm serious.
5269744	5273006	I fucking need to catch up on like every fucking expedition from this year.
5273006	5275627	So yeah, I'm into that.
5275627	5277068	Quest Buster, drop the link.
5277068	5278189	I need to look at more.
5278189	5282271	I well, this is what I don't use the the bird app anymore.
5282271	5285013	And I used to, you know, keep an eye on the No Man's Sky account.
5285013	5287195	And now I miss him if they don't make their way over to Blue Sky.
5287195	5288595	So it's alright.
5288595	5289116	It is what it is.
5289116	5289136	I
5289676	5293680	Alright, um, let's take a trip down memory lane.
5293680	5297924	Let's take a trip down memory lane to a game that is super fun in our next segment.
5297924	5298785	Let's get to the bump.
5309508	5317271	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5317271	5321013	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5321013	5326015	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the game this week?
5326015	5330716	I picked a game that came out this month.
5330716	5335398	And let me know if you're ready to start feeling like, huh, really?
5335398	5336599	The game I picked is Deadpool.
5339329	5347351	Yeah, we haven't had one of these pics in a while where it's like, this game just turned 10 years old, so it qualifies.
5347351	5348671	Yes.
5348671	5357793	Um, it was developed by High Moon Studios, published by Activision, um, for Windows, digital format only, PS3, Xbox 360.
5357793	5361293	It came out in June 2013.
5361293	5368515	Anyway, um, it basically follows Deadpool working with X-Men, working with Cable,
5371033	5376139	and trying to stop a scheme of Mr. Sinister.
5376139	5378222	Other stuff that happens.
5378222	5381466	And this is totally a Deadpool game.
5381466	5382927	Fourth wall breakage.
5382927	5383468	Everything.
5383468	5384449	You name it, it's there.
5387562	5390384	It got some extra views.
5390384	5397830	The humor was definitely up there, but the gameplay was not so good, and I can vouch for that.
5397830	5407919	A lot of the games, though, that had the Marvel license by Activision was delisted and removed in 2014, and then it was brought back in 2016.
5410501	5417547	just through Steam and the PlayStation Store as download content only in the US markets.
5417547	5427394	It was re-released on November 18, 2015 for PS4 and Xbox One to coincide with the movie's release.
5427394	5431297	And then it was removed again due to licensing in 2017.
5435103	5444910	It is very hack and slash, third person, you know, um, you fight enemies with melee weapons and guns.
5444910	5454737	You do combos, you, you know, go through the story, get upgrade points, learn stuff, and, uh, basically just shit talk everybody cause you're a Deadpool.
5454737	5463443	Um, some of his weapons apart from the guns and swords are giant hammers, plasma guns, um, furniture, um,
5464875	5476678	So, we know he heals, but in-game the way this works is that you have to prevent further damage in order to recover.
5476678	5482499	You have stealth segments, you have to be vigilant.
5482499	5490641	Although, if you use gun stealth, it tells everybody where you are because it's a fucking gun.
5490641	5492162	A little bit of the plot of the game.
5494227	5498830	It's a pitch for the most awesome game ever, starring himself, and the studio rejects it.
5498830	5501192	The same studio that made the game.
5501192	5505175	So he sets off explosives at the studios and forces them to cooperate.
5505175	5510619	And then he hires Nolan North as his voice actor!
5510619	5514842	...actor in many things.
5514842	5521887	And so, he goes out to assassinate this media person
5523580	5528404	basically blows his budget all in the first mission.
5528404	5550560	So, uh, the rest of it, you know, uh, basically fighting budget issues while going through the rest of the game and recruiting, you know, uh, X-Men, uh, some of X-Force, uh, going to Geonosha, crashing a plane.
5550560	5552522	Um, but anyway, um,
5553908	5561531	I'm not gonna go too much into it, but it's there for a story and very Deadpool.
5561531	5563972	The story I thought was pretty okay.
5563972	5570115	It was announced in 2012 at San Diego Comic-Con with only a trailer, and people were like, yeah!
5570115	5575737	And then Marvel let out the article about it right after.
5575737	5579739	And it was written from Deadpool's point of view.
5579739	5580639	And then, uh...
5583470	5586745	It went, it was like, I love how it was this total like...
5588556	5589336	augmented thing.
5589336	5595940	For the record, no one special 77 who says, but are there chimichangas in the comics?
5595940	5599041	And I'm specifically referring to Cable and Deadpool.
5599041	5607045	So few years ago, um, that he does not like chimichangas, but likes the word chimichanga.
5607045	5608926	That is canonical.
5608926	5610426	People forget that.
5610426	5613368	I don't forget that because I know comics.
5613368	5613648	Anyway,
5615470	5618093	The game was created in Unreal Engine 3.
5618093	5628407	The budget was $100 million, so it was one of the most expensive video games ever developed.
5628407	5631331	There was a censored version of the trailer.
5634001	5639504	They had an actor dressed up as Deadpool showing up on stage and everything.
5639504	5644427	I mean, there was some pretty clever marketing for this.
5644427	5655772	And it was actually written by Daniel Leigh, who basically had been a longtime Deadpool author.
5655772	5659414	I mean, like, his biggest works were Wolverine Origins, Deadpool,
5662330	5664431	So, I mean, some pretty good stuff there.
5664431	5666692	Worked on Spider-Man for a while.
5666692	5678255	Bunch of different, uh, he also worked on Agent X with, if no one's read that series, it's a really good little side, uh, footnote in Deadpool lore.
5678255	5685758	Um, so going back, uh, you know, there were, there were contests, there were all kinds of stuff.
5685758	5685818	Um.
5687533	5690034	And, you know, it was successful.
5690034	5696055	I mean, the game, I think, sold fairly well.
5696055	5707338	You know, like I said, there was that issue going on with the licensing that I think really kicked it in the ass.
5707338	5711619	So, it did receive some mixed reviews.
5712996	5715256	Um, I mean, everyone liked the story.
5715256	5716897	They liked the humor.
5716897	5720057	You know, it was very true to the comics.
5720057	5722778	The controls and gameplay were just not where it was.
5722778	5725258	I mean, I- I- I will tell you this.
5725258	5727119	The controls sucked for me.
5727119	5728479	They sucked.
5728479	5731380	Um, and yeah, I did find it pretty repetitive.
5731380	5738361	It was, you know... Part- parts also where the- the-
5742921	5752388	part of the game and they actually mention this in what I'm reading where he leaves the camera behind and you have to pick up the camera and follow him.
5752388	5770181	So I think just a really annoying part but I mean the rest of it was I mean for me it was the story and the humor in that that made it fun but the game itself that it just wasn't fun to play.
5772206	5778432	If you really want to enjoy this game, watch someone else play it.
5778432	5780874	I'm going to be honest.
5780874	5782555	I'm going to be perfectly honest.
5782555	5787179	Thankfully, Twitch and YouTube let us do that.
5787179	5788841	Indeed, indeed.
5788841	5793545	I love that Hitmonkey was in this game, though.
5793545	5797628	And Bob, Agent of Hydra, who is one of my favorite characters.
5797628	5797949	All right.
5797949	5799450	Well, is that it for Deadpool?
5802571	5803411	That's it for Deadpool!
5828946	5854520	all right that's science uh let's move on and we've got some more stories for you i know we've had some uh shows with less stories lately but we have a few more for you tonight uh we're gonna start it off though of course with some rapid fire news oh real quick i'll put in a rapid thing myself here because i was reading that link that um quest buster dropped in chat about the no man's sky expeditions so who excuse me burp see i had soda um
5855180	5858042	They are running for just a week a piece.
5858042	5865026	So Utopia, which was the first expedition, is running right now, which thankfully I already finished that one or I'd be pissed I'm getting a late start.
5865026	5867647	But there were less expeditions this year.
5867647	5868527	There were only three.
5868527	5877212	So they're actually rerunning one of them, the very first one I believe it was, which was Cartographers.
5877212	5878113	That is going to run
5879113	5881675	The 22nd of December through the 29th of December.
5881675	5883096	So the week of Christmas, essentially.
5883096	5892682	That is going to be... And if you have never done that one, which if you are a Switch player, you didn't have the opportunity because the Switch version didn't come out until a little later.
5892682	5898006	I would urge you to pay attention to this Cartographer's one because the reward is the Golden Vector ship.
5898006	5902669	That is like the best ship you can get in your inventory to jumpstart any game.
5902669	5906451	So that one is worth paying attention to, if nothing else.
5906451	5907652	So keep an eye out for that.
5909246	5913097	Alright, um, let's now get into some actual rapid fire news.
5913097	5914842	Sorry, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?
5915492	5926079	Yes, so I think we even talked about that this was coming, but John Romero has finally released Sigil 2, which you can get at Romero.com.
5926079	5933564	And it's basically a brand new level pack for Doom.
5933564	5938828	And it's a complete new campaign, free of charge, the best cost
5939848	5945571	Um, and actually I think Sigil 2 is also, uh, yeah, Doom 2 episode is available as well.
5945571	5949693	So I guess, I don't, is this for Doom or Doom 2?
5949693	5950213	I don't know.
5950213	5952334	One of them it is for.
5952334	5953935	Um, so that's awesome.
5953935	5957076	And that was for Doom's 30th anniversary.
5957076	5966301	And then of course, along with that, uh, we have this really cool mod where someone has modded Wolfenstein 3D into Doom 2.
5966301	5968542	Uh, which is pretty crazy into that engine.
5968542	5968802	I mean,
5970137	5972319	Yeah, I guess it makes sense.
5972319	5975641	I was going to say, yeah, with all the bonus levels in there.
5975641	5978103	So that makes sense that you could do that.
5978103	5982427	But it's cool that, you know, people put in games and other games.
5982427	5984248	Love it.
5984248	5996258	I just remember doing the level skip, and I want to say it was like level 37 or 47, something like that, was a Wolfenstein level that you would otherwise, I think, need a special door to get to.
5996258	5997659	Yeah, I remember playing that.
5997659	5998500	I remember that, too.
5998500	5998700	Yeah.
6001058	6009924	Nintendo Switch Online has gotten some updates, so we have some brand new games, well, brand new to the service games that are available there.
6009924	6025213	So from the Nintendo 64, we have Harvest Moon 64 and Jet Force Gemini that are joining, as well as 1080 degree snowboarding.
6025213	6027374	So that's pretty cool.
6027374	6029015	Check those out if you have the
6029639	6032361	I think you have to have the expansion pass for that though.
6032361	6035883	Yeah, for those systems.
6035883	6039205	DarkSakura?
6039205	6043148	So, it has been confirmed.
6043148	6055476	No further sequels to the open world Legend of Zelda series, so Tears of the Kingdom is going to be it after Breath of the Wild.
6055476	6057698	There will be no more
6059019	6062702	No more in that specific aspect of the series.
6062702	6064044	So, that's it.
6068550	6083034	Basically, Aonuma said, and I'm just going to read this, as I've mentioned previously, with Tears of the Kingdom, we were seeking to build on top of the world we created in Breath of the Wild and really exhaust the possibilities of what we could put into that world.
6083034	6091476	I think it is, to use a bit of a term, an apotheosis, or the final form of that version of The Legend of Zelda.
6091476	6096718	In that regard, I don't think that we'll be making a direct sequel to a world such as that we've created.
6099462	6104537	If anyone does not know what apotheosis means, it means basically to ascend as a deity.
6106144	6109085	I think that's a pretty good term for it.
6130490	6133252	play into that hardware twist in one way or another.
6133252	6141397	If you think about it, Breath of the Wild was kind of built with the Wii U in mind, even though, yeah, obviously it ended up being a little more associated as a Switch game.
6141397	6150903	But, you know, and then as DarkSakura was reading there in the quote, Tears of the Kingdom was essentially the best version of Breath of the Wild because it wasn't limited by anything Wii U, right?
6150903	6152464	It was really only for the Switch.
6152464	6154005	So there was that.
6154005	6158668	And so I think wherever they go with the next hardware, it's just going to be just going to be different.
6158668	6159068	And that's OK.
6160666	6163827	And yeah, Tigerclaw also points out there is a little bit of a pattern maybe.
6163827	6169368	There's usually like two Zelda games that are from the same universe before they do another reboot set in another universe.
6169368	6174309	So maybe kind of a throwback to like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask sort of thing.
6174309	6176949	So yeah, maybe.
6176949	6182210	You know what else came out the year that Deadpool came out was A Link Between Worlds.
6182210	6182710	Oh, wow.
6182710	6186171	Yeah, that was I'd love for them to go back and do that kind of game.
6186171	6187371	Technically the second
6189707	6191049	Yeah, technically is the second.
6191049	6198738	And you know, we did get the remake of the Game Boy game, you know, so we did get that 2.5 Zelda on that one was pretty good.
6198738	6199939	Yeah, and that was pretty good.
6199939	6205767	So there's there's room for all types of Zeldas.
6205767	6209171	If I recall correctly, though, I think that also is in the link to the past universe.
6212137	6219639	Um, I don't, well, the Link Between Worlds was, I don't think, uh, the Game Boy one was.
6219639	6223699	I think they just did it in that art style for the remake.
6223699	6224440	Yeah.
6224440	6229761	Well, but, and they, they did that one, but then they also did, uh, Seasons and Ages.
6229761	6234102	So there was, uh, there was that later, but.
6234102	6240003	Well, no, I was more referring, cause I know that it was just that they started making the game and then got the go ahead.
6240003	6241143	Might be a little bit.
6242475	6244816	are a little bit late on the date for it.
6244816	6252900	I actually think that it was around Zelda 2.
6252900	6253500	Go back and look it up.
6254276	6255798	Alright, well let's move on.
6255798	6261964	I just have a quick story here for Rapid Fire News, and it has to do with a new thing that they've added to Splatoon 3.
6261964	6266388	And it's actually causing some issues for folks with photosensitivity and sensory issues.
6266388	6270372	It's called the Splatter Color Screen, and it's a new special weapon.
6270372	6274396	It creates a large ink barrier that will damage players when they walk through it.
6275297	6281564	And the game will end up swapping from normal colors to grayscale and it has a sound effect that goes with that as well.
6281564	6289954	So I mean it all it sounds very interesting but if you have a photosensitivity or sensory issue apparently this the what happens with this can
6290675	6296656	cause, and reports are coming in about strain, dizziness, migraines, and even fainting on top of that.
6296656	6300097	And color blindness is also having some issues with the screen as well.
6300097	6305939	You know, Nintendo is usually pretty good about addressing these sorts of situations with a patch.
6305939	6311000	So hopefully, you know, there'll be an accessibility setting, or they just kind of maybe change a little bit.
6311000	6312840	Maybe, maybe I haven't seen the effect myself.
6312840	6316101	So I don't know if it's just too intense, or something what's happening there.
6316101	6319842	But as you should with any video game, if you start to feel unwell,
6320302	6322305	Meanwhile, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.
6339604	6353480	Hammerwatch 2 and Nintendo Switch on PS5, Ready or Not on PC, Boston Knights on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series
6354321	6359948	Bulletstorm VR on PC, PlayStation VR 2 and Quest 2.
6359948	6364794	We have Custom Mech Wars on PC and PlayStation 5.
6364794	6371502	Nosea on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6371502	6372964	Granblue Fantasy
6373965	6379587	Versus Rising on PC, PS4, PS5, Grand Theft Auto The Trilogy on iOS and Android House Flipper 2 on PC
6393419	6400165	Rakowoo Venture on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6400165	6409413	Witch on The Holy Knight on PC, and Asgard's Wrath on Quest 2 and Quest 3.
6409413	6409693	That's it.
6410205	6414928	All right, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases December 14th on the switch.
6414928	6416609	We actually have a few things.
6416609	6418210	And yeah, it starts off with this.
6418210	6424113	If you want to experience the shit show that is the Lord of the Rings Gollum, you're going to get your chance in Japan this week.
6424113	6426274	And yeah, they have translated it for Japan.
6426274	6426735	Why?
6427615	6439821	I do notice that the price to import this game is only $40, which is a lot cheaper than most import games, so I wonder if they didn't turn around and release this as a budget title for obvious reasons, because the game is shit, if you haven't heard.
6443223	6444744	Kumaju Remilia 2 Stranger's Requiem Taito LD LaserDisc
6468027	6476472	including TimeGal HD Remaster, Space Battleship Yamato HD Remaster, and Revenge of the Ninja HD Remaster.
6476472	6478953	So if you want to check those out, that is all in a Switch collection.
6478953	6480874	That's kind of fun and I doubt we'll get that here.
6480874	6483316	So that's a fun import if you want to check that out.
6483316	6487378	Battleship Yamato was Star Blazers here in the US.
6487378	6489820	But have we have we had a release of that on Switch?
6489820	6491020	I don't think so.
6491020	6492741	So I don't know, maybe maybe they will do it.
6492741	6495523	I haven't had a game but I mean, yeah.
6496474	6497314	I don't know.
6497314	6503576	Anyway, um, looking at some other releases in Japan this week, we have Komajou, I'm sorry, I already read that one.
6503576	6506497	Triggerheart Excelica is also out this week.

6519760	6521001	So it has Cosmic Fantasy 3,
6521801	6544724	cosmic fantasy 4 and then a second cosmic fantasy 4 game because i think it was like a gold and silver kind of thing um also we have borderlands 3 getting a release in like a game of the year style edition this week on the switch and i think that's it oh no one more a tetsudo nippon real pro tokyo romance car
6546249	6546829	and Romance Train Cars
6560802	6563325	Train cars would treat me better than most men would, let's be honest.
6563325	6566810	All right, going to PlayStation 5.
6566810	6571977	We have Custom Mech Wars comes out in Japan this week, as well as Under the Waves.
6571977	6573979	Nosia is out this week.
6573979	6578005	Volume 11 of the Kemco RPG selection.
6579548	6584631	Alphadea, Nioh, King's Descent, Ancient Hunter, and Iskai Rondo are in this set.
6584631	6587093	The 11th collection in Japan.
6587093	6589615	I want to meet somebody that owns all 11.
6589615	6594038	Front Mission First Remake, also out in Japan this week, and Submerged Hidden Devs.
6594038	6597380	What's that, DarkSakura?
6601761	6605143	Um, I know, I'm sorry about the lag thing, I'm trying to fix it.
6605143	6609967	But something about Komajo Remilia is that I own this game on Switch.
6609967	6611968	Oh, fun!
6611968	6612488	Interesting.
6612488	6617492	It's the same thing, and I think, if I'm right, it's in the Toho series.
6617492	6624176	Yep, you are playing as Reimu, who is one of the major Toho characters.
6624176	6625637	Alrighty.
6625637	6629460	Basically plays like Symphony of the Night.
6629460	6630761	We love us a Metroidvania.
6631715	6639780	Alright, but that was all I had for Japanese releases, so we can go to the UK.
6639780	6646944	Yeah, it's lagging a bit, so just try to jump in there when you can.
6646944	6648044	Well, there's only one game.
6648044	6653988	It's Hammerwatch 2 The Chronicles Edition on December 12th for Switch and PlayStation, and that's it.
6654966	6660115	Alright, well, we do still have a few headlines for you before we get to the listener roundtable.
6660115	6662258	So let's get to Loki.
6662258	6664702	And this one is Wow, go ahead, Loki.
6665373	6672077	So the FTC apparently is still trying to block the acquisition of Activision by Microsoft.
6672077	6689789	They were arguing in front of the appeals court in California, saying that basically the original attempts to block the deal were held too high a standard by requiring the government agency to prove that the deal was anti-competitive.
6690289	6700802	They fail to understand how giving somebody a monopoly of something would be pro-competitive, said their lawyer during the appeal case.
6700802	6706790	It may be a benefit to some class of consumers, but that's very different than saying it's pro-competitive.
6708812	6714296	I really hate that we have a government body arguing something that they don't know anything about.
6714296	6727705	Like, because they're saying that, oh, it's anti-competitive for Microsoft to acquire Activision, but at the same time, there are many games that are released specifically to those platforms.
6728385	6733827	As well, like Square Enix does a lot of those games that only come out on that platform.
6733827	6745872	And so, and being that they've committed to having these titles come out on other platforms for at least like 10 years or something, it's ridiculous to call it anti-competitive.
6748422	6748922	I don't know.
6748922	6756925	I don't know why they're still, why they're putting so much fuss into this and not like, say, the cable companies and overcharging us for internet because that's been a thing forever.
6756925	6760007	I want to talk about monopolies and anti-competitive.
6760007	6763028	Why don't we focus on that instead of, like, video games?
6763028	6763548	But whatever.
6764669	6770254	SSU 100 Matt in chat says a government body wasting time and money on something that's pointless.
6770254	6778681	I perfectly said I mean, I get it supposed to be like, you know, for consumers, but like I feel that this is such a small
6780285	6783768	It's such a small thing in comparison to other stuff.
6783768	6787413	It's like, oh, this may hurt one video game company.
6787413	6790056	How about you look at how Zaslav is hurting Hollywood?
6790056	6791037	Why don't you go look into that?
6791037	6791637	Exactly.
6791637	6792859	There you go.
6792859	6795181	There's a lot of things that they could be looking into.
6796002	6800305	Um, I just don't see why they're so dead set on like, stopping this, but okay.
6800305	6806049	Why don't you look into, why don't you look into, um, God, what was, uh, what was the great nickname I heard for him today?
6806049	6809911	But you know, you all know the guy I hate that owns Twitter at this point.
6809911	6812413	Um, they, uh, oh, Phony Stark.
6812413	6813493	That was the name I heard.
6813493	6814754	Ha, Phony Stark.
6814754	6818897	Why don't they look into Phony Stark and how the fuck he's allowed to hang onto this platform?
6818897	6821318	There's so many other things that they could be looking into.
6821318	6821818	Like why,
6822699	6825262	DarkSakura with an update on Twitch culture
6846823	6850506	Yep, they are shutting down in South Korea.
6850506	6859172	So they are going to be ending at the end of February 2027 and basically said it's too damn expensive.
6859172	6867358	They said that it will work to help their streamers that are based in South Korea move their communities to alternative live streaming services.
6868478	6873362	and said that it was very difficult to suspend their business there.
6873362	6880187	They've been operating at a significant loss and that it's basically 10 times more expensive than other countries.
6880187	6890695	And even though they've tried to reduce the cost a lot, including limiting their source quality to 720p, it hasn't helped them recoup any.
6890695	6890915	So
6893706	6898351	Also, I'm going to say this, just something about the article that I like.
6898351	6903757	You know how many are saying the statement on, you know, Letter, formerly known as Twitter?
6903757	6906860	I like that this one uses, nay, Twitter.
6906860	6908902	Like, it's made a name.
6910925	6912626	I saw a lot of streamers reacting to this.
6912626	6912966	Truly sucks.
6912966	6914407	Many of them felt like they were essentially fired.
6933837	6946086	It does sound like though the cost of it and I'm I'm not up to date on these types of situations, but it sounds like the bandwidth in South Korea is a lot more and you kind of said that you outlined the 10 times more expensive and so forth.
6946086	6949028	So it's just that the bandwidth costs for whatever reasons are higher.
6949028	6953632	So maybe this is something I can't can they pressure the government?
6953632	6953972	Excuse me?
6955353	6956633	Too much soda.
6956633	6960794	Can they pressure the government to try to lower bandwidth and make it more accessible?
6960794	6961334	Maybe?
6961334	6967156	Is this the ploy to try to get people to petition lawmakers to regulate this and make it cheaper?
6967156	6976958	I don't know if that's even a thing, but sometimes companies will make moves like this to try to get upset people to effect change in other ways.
6980250	6980911	Moving on, Loki.
7001458	7011240	Yes, so we have news now that Alone in the Dark, the remake has been postponed to March 20th, 2024 to avoid crunch.
7011240	7020143	So THQ Nordic basically, they've said that to avoid any potential crunch over the Christmas holidays.
7020143	7022363	Now, is that going to be crunched towards March?
7022363	7022903	Who knows?
7022903	7029105	But at least over the Christmas holidays, they are going to be giving them more time to put the game together.
7029105	7030085	So that's good.
7031718	7032780	Yeah, this is good news.
7032780	7040690	Happy holidays to all the employees there, you know, and especially when I believe THQ Nordic's been in the news for a lot of other interesting things lately.
7040690	7043173	It's, this is a welcome change of pace.
7043173	7046037	And yeah, if that's what has to be done for the game to be right, good.
7047299	7048880	Justin is in our chat right now.
7048880	7051822	Hello, friends, saying avoiding crunch is always a good thing.
7051822	7053584	There are plenty of games to play right now.
7053584	7054925	Isn't that the truth?
7054925	7055706	There's plenty.
7055706	7057947	There's plenty of stuff to play.
7057947	7062411	And now games are birthing games inside games.
7062411	7069897	So you can always go play more things in Fortnite if you want or whatever, Roblox, whatever the hell it is you're into.
7069897	7072380	You've got games within a game at this point.
7072380	7073500	There is your backlog.
7074302	7077133	is too fucking big right now.
7077133	7079844	You don't need Alone in the Dark on top of everything else.
7082236	7098888	Alright, well, one more story I have for you, and that has to do with, hey, Hideo Kojima, all the rage this week, and did you know that there's actually a documentary that Hideo Kojima is actually putting together on himself, of course, called Hideo Kojima Connecting Worlds.
7098888	7105013	It will be exclusively released in Disney+, here in America.
7105013	7107074	He posted on, nay, Twitter,
7108115	7115460	that the film, which has already been shown at the Tribeca Film Festival, will launch globally in the spring of 2024.
7115460	7124966	In the movie, it goes over the development of Death Stranding, and you actually get to see part of the creative process as he was launching his own independent studio.
7124966	7132711	Apparently, there are shots from the early days of independent studio, memories from childhood and the creative journey, so he's tried to put a lot of this in here.
7135436	7146827	No word if it says anything about upcoming games, but seeing as we already know the movie debuted at Tribeca Film Festival, I don't think it does, unless they maybe added something to it, but I wouldn't go in expecting that.
7146827	7152953	We do have now, I know when we saw that, what?
7152953	7154755	We should have a watch and react party.
7156016	7159819	Uh, maybe it can be hard because it's a copyright thing.
7159819	7163301	If it was on Amazon, we could do one of those watch party things.
7163301	7166464	But it's harder to do a Disney plus because it would technically be copyright.
7166464	7174009	So we could do like one of those things where it's like audio commentary or press play now type of thing.
7174009	7176811	But yeah, we wouldn't be able to do something live, unfortunately, copyright.
7179215	7181980	I just meant us watching it and making fun of it.
7181980	7183563	Oh, I thought you meant and put it on the internet.
7183563	7186227	Well, if it's just us, then fine.
7186227	7188692	I do want to point out because... We can do that.
7188692	7190355	I mean, I know that there are ways of getting around it.
7190905	7197971	When the OD trailer debuted, we had Deft in our chat was talking about it needs to have Guillermo del Toro in it.
7197971	7198592	Well, guess what?
7198592	7199533	Good news for you, Deft.
7199533	7203156	Guillermo del Toro is in this documentary.
7203156	7206980	Video gaming is an art, says Guillermo del Toro in the trailer.
7206980	7211183	But the only person in charge of the orchestra is the auteur.
7211183	7215427	So check out that documentary when it comes out if you have Disney+.
7215427	7217129	And if you don't have Disney+, I guess you'll pirate it.
7218230	7222273	DejiramS points out private watch party in Discord.
7222273	7226597	I guess it's a gray area, but maybe.
7226597	7230180	So yeah, OrangeRite calls it VOGtracks.
7230180	7233542	Cute.
7233542	7237866	It's the same thing you were saying, just you know, hit play at the same time and everyone watch it.
7237866	7238806	Oh, yeah.
7238806	7240027	Yeah, we could do that.
7240027	7243150	That's like that Netflix party on Xbox 360 was the best thing ever.
7243150	7246793	And it was essentially that so you do have that.
7247748	7250930	Alright, well, believe it or not, that was our last scheduled story tonight.
7250930	7254072	So we now invite interaction from all of you.
7254072	7258695	We always invite your emails and participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7258695	7262658	I don't think there was anything that there was a actually I should have went in and deleted it, Jamie.
7262658	7266240	There was a really well done marketing email in there.
7266240	7269182	That's like it's addressed to you and I deleted everything.
7269182	7270663	It calls out the show.
7270663	7272244	Yeah, it was it was it was marketing.
7272244	7275907	But I was like, wow, this person actually their database is very good.
7275907	7277008	That scrapes all the info.
7279609	7280949	Wait, wait, wait.
7280949	7282690	Should I have looked at this?
7282690	7284910	No, because it's nothing we're interested in.
7284910	7287511	It was it was for like a caffeine drink or something.
7287511	7303857	But I was like, Wow, I think I was like to chat to help because it actually incorporated parts of our podcast description that talked about you won these podcast awards for all the things that are in our description.
7303857	7304457	And I was like,
7305359	7311022	Okay, like, yeah, I'm very happy with those awards, but they were like over 10 years ago.
7311022	7319827	So like, it just felt very chat GPT generated, like write an invite for this podcast based on their description.
7319827	7322668	So anyway, get that.
7322668	7323369	All right.
7323369	7323469	Um,
7324778	7331242	But I will invite your calls as well over at, uh, vognetwork.com slash discord.
7331242	7336765	If you want to call in and it appears we have a caller who is waiting right there to be on the program tonight.
7336765	7338887	So let's go and say hello.
7338887	7339707	Hi caller.
7339707	7340307	You're on the air.
7340307	7341928	Who's this?
7341928	7345951	The one and only DJ Ron S and let me go ahead and turn my camera on and go.
7345951	7347011	Hi everybody.
7347011	7347492	Oh, yay.
7347492	7347912	We love it.
7347912	7349113	When you actually get on the cam.
7349113	7350253	Hey Rama, good to see you.
7350253	7350654	How are you?
7351596	7352417	I'm good.
7352417	7354839	I'm, I've spent half the day packing.
7354839	7356680	So, you know.
7356680	7357361	Oh, that's right.
7357361	7359222	You're going on your big trip real soon.
7359222	7360784	Like real soon.
7360784	7361845	Yes.
7361845	7369771	So since you brought it up, I'm assuming we're okay to talk about the fact that you're going to Japan, uh, in a matter of days, I'm really excited for you.
7369771	7378138	What, what, what are some of like the big, don't tell us everything cause it's only a three hour show, but what are some of the big highlights that you're planning on doing when you're in Japan?
7378138	7380440	There is a lot of things, but,
7381516	7393461	The first thing I plan to do once I've gotten some energy in me, and I fully checked in the hotel and so forth, I am going to do a pilgrimage.
7393461	7403166	I will be going to the Nerima Ward, and I'll be walking around that entire neighborhood that's because where Ranma 1 half took place.
7403166	7403846	Oh, okay.
7403846	7405787	Cute.
7405787	7408848	Then you have to take pictures from the Odaiba Bridge for me.
7408848	7409448	I will.
7409448	7410789	I will add that to my notes.
7412383	7414184	Have you been to Japan before?
7414184	7416745	Sorry, Digimon fan.
7416745	7418506	No, I've never been.
7418506	7419867	That's just it.
7419867	7424330	Neither have I. Good for you that you're getting this off your bucket list or what have you.
7424330	7425911	I'm jealous.
7425911	7427351	Well, you can do it, too.
7427351	7427632	I know.
7427632	7428112	You're right.
7428112	7429353	I can.
7429353	7432154	I chose to do the Star Trek cruise again next year.
7432154	7435216	I could have used that money to do something like this.
7435216	7437797	But we're probably not doing it again in 2025.
7437797	7439718	Just saying.
7439718	7440219	There you go.
7441596	7443617	I will be going, my plan is to go to Tokyo Disney Sea for my 50th.
7462348	7463669	Um, how long are you staying?
7463669	7467352	I really want to go and then buy all the Duffy stuff.
7467352	7470014	I am going for roughly two weeks.
7470014	7475077	I am coming back like a couple of days early so I can get readjusted for jet lag and so forth.
7475077	7482463	Because three days after I return, the office opens up and we have brand new people coming into the office.
7482463	7484604	It's gonna be hell.
7484604	7485585	You have no idea.
7486417	7487358	All right.
7487358	7490121	Well, bon voyage.
7490121	7493924	I hope you have a wonderful trip and I look forward to hearing all about it.
7493924	7494365	Is that why?
7494365	7495966	That's not why you called in tonight, I bet.
7495966	7496687	No, no, no.
7496687	7497708	That's not why I called.
7497708	7498889	Why did you call in tonight?
7498889	7499870	You didn't call in just to brag.
7499870	7501392	You just called to brag.
7501392	7502112	I know.
7502112	7504174	Which honestly, honestly, go off.
7504174	7506416	Like you have every right to brag about something like that.
7506416	7506717	I would.
7506717	7507257	Yeah.
7507257	7508138	So.
7508138	7510941	But now that you've gotten the bragging out of the way, what did you really want to talk about?
7512102	7513963	First off, love you Uk-chan.
7513963	7528255	Secondly, I was reminded of a topic from last week about how Sony pulled all the digital videos off their service, and I understood it was because of WBD, you know, more than anything else.
7528255	7537383	Yeah, I feel the more accurate way to phrase that is that WDBD pulled their videos from Sony's service.
7537383	7539185	I think it's a little bit, that's fine, that's fine.
7540545	7548368	And it got me to thinking about how there are a lot of games that come out and we're excited for and we're like, oh, we're going to pre-order this.
7548368	7555650	And we're sitting here waiting for the announcement of said game and all of the features and so forth, like what you're going to get with it.
7555650	7558091	Then you find out it's just a digital only game.
7559901	7564803	One of the games I just picked up was Yohane da Barhelion, it's a Metroidvania game.
7564803	7572286	It was digital only here in the States, but meanwhile, while I was at Anime NYC, I was able to pick up a physical copy for PlayStation 5.
7572286	7574366	Oh wow.
7574366	7581489	And since it's like multi-regioned game, so I'm like, it didn't matter, I could play it in English and so forth, so you know.
7581489	7581609	And...
7583448	7584389	I remember.
7584389	7587151	Ranma, I don't pre-order games anymore.
7587151	7593095	Once in a great while, I pre-ordered Final Fantasy XVI two weeks before it came out.
7593095	7598239	By the time they're already public, and you know exactly what you're getting in that edition.
7598239	7608586	I realized that the industry really relies on these types of pre-orders, and some would say that I should not discourage people from pre-ordering because it could harm the bottom line of the industry.
7609106	7622872	However, I would say as the industry continues to move in this direction and by the examples that they've given us, such as what you have given you, I think it's a buyer beware situation and you should not be so quick to pre-order these things.
7622872	7628595	I mean, I bet half those things they showed trailers for at the Game Awards, you could pre-order now if you wanted to.
7628595	7629035	Honestly,
7629835	7637600	don't, because games, games don't sell out now, because at worst case scenario, you get a digital, right?
7637600	7645225	Like games, that era of I'm not going to be able to get the game I want is gone, because you could always get it digitally.
7645225	7649548	Now, the era of I can't get the hardware I want is still very much among us.
7650442	7655986	I have pre-ordered so many games and I realized if I had just waited I could have saved $10, $20, $30
7666212	7669794	There are some games, there are some special editions that I need to get my hands on.
7669794	7675697	Like, yes, I did drop 90 bucks on the Bayonetta 3 Special Edition.
7675697	7678198	That's one of the few special editions where you can get it now for $60.
7678198	7680379	I'm like, I didn't know.
7680379	7685081	And my backlog is so far that the game is still, the box is still sitting like right behind me.
7685081	7689223	If everybody's watching on the screen by my clothes or whatever, the box is standing, is back there.
7689223	7693745	And I'm like, if I had waited a year, I could have gotten it off of Amazon for like 80 bucks.
7693745	7694986	Behind all the big boy shirts.
7696411	7698932	Oh, you mean soon-to-be-medium boy shirts.
7698932	7701014	Oh, okay.
7701014	7707117	But, um, I remember y'all had mentioned, uh, like, coming up, River City Rival Showdown.
7707117	7710298	I was like, okay, I will pick this up for Switch.
7710298	7712860	And I'm like, are we getting a physical release?
7714568	7722294	Not in the States, but I had to do some importing to get my hands on the limited edition copy, which was like 10 bucks more.
7722294	7730281	But even if it wasn't, something like this, because I'm a big fan of the Kunio-kun series, I went out and I bought it.
7730281	7731702	Same thing with the Yohane game.
7731702	7738327	Yes, I have it digital, because I'm a fan of that, the Love Live series, I went out and got the PS5 version of the game.
7738327	7740329	And I was like, sure, why not?
7741676	7751279	I really feel that, you know, we have all these digital games coming out, but if the sales are there, do a limited run of a physical release.
7751279	7759521	I mean, like, in a way that kind of worked for TMNT Shredder's Revenge, yes, I have, I played the digital version on Game Pass.
7759521	7768764	I think I actually bought it with the DLC, and then I went out and pre-ordered the physical copy from Limited Run Games.
7768764	7769584	I love Limited Run.
7773214	7784636	as do I. Well, yeah, and I think I think especially after what happened with Warner Brothers and Sony and all that, you know, there's going to be more people that think twice about buying digital and relying on digital.
7784636	7788997	And for me, digital really only makes sense for me in two cases.
7788997	7792638	Number one, PC games, because they just they don't make physical PC games anymore.
7792638	7793498	They just don't.
7793498	7801080	Like so few PCs even come with a fucking DVD drive at this point or CD or anything like they're just there's just it's all digital at this point.
7801420	7802381	What was the last game you bought?
7824738	7826619	The last game I bought?
7826619	7828201	Oh, a disc?
7828201	7832424	Well, Final Fantasy XVI.
7832424	7833765	No, I take that back.
7833765	7836907	Star Trek Online.
7836907	7838288	Final Fantasy XVI had a disc.
7838288	7844994	I want to say I've bought something since then on PlayStation, but that one comes to mind because... I meant, no, on PC.
7844994	7845634	Oh, on PC.
7845634	7846115	On computer.
7846975	7847936	Oh, fuck.
7847936	7849297	Um... Yeah.
7849297	7850958	Probably a Final Fantasy XIV expansion.
7850958	7852198	I think mine was Star Trek Online.
7852198	7854480	I want to say a Final Fantasy XIV expansion.
7854480	7859703	Before they were... I think maybe Stormblood was the last one that actually had a DVD with it.
7859703	7860723	Probably that.
7860723	7863885	I can tell you the last console game that I bought was Ozmin.
7863885	7864186	For Dan.
7867233	7868794	Yeah, and you know what, Rob?
7868794	7869494	You're right.
7869494	7871735	We're going towards digital.
7871735	7874417	And I'm old school.
7874417	7875497	I'm a Gen Xer.
7875497	7877138	I want my physical copies.
7877138	7878779	I need to step away for just a moment.
7878779	7880100	I'm sorry, everybody, but keep talking.
7881115	7885897	It's just that I'd like to have something to have.
7885897	7886858	That's all it is.
7886858	7893181	I mean, if the digital is dirt cheap, then sure, I will go ahead and get the digital version.
7893181	7898564	Now, if I can get my hands on a physical copy of it at a reasonable price, I'll absolutely do it.
7901872	7907398	But now that, you know, you got the console, you know, you got consoles, you know, you could add extra memory to it.
7907398	7908559	It's going to go that route.
7908559	7921513	It's like, yeah, I pre-ordered FF7 Rebirth, I got the collector's edition, and that same week I'm picking up my PS5 and a 2TB drive to have it all ready to go for the game when it arrives.
7926755	7937478	I mean, that's the nature of things, although I honestly wish for some systems that you actually could increase their memory, and I mean RAM, and not storage.
7937478	7942319	I kind of feel that on the next generation of consoles, there should be two drives.
7942319	7948381	One drive should be just the OS drive, and the second drive is just strictly data.
7948381	7949301	Because we're getting there.
7949301	7955223	I mean, so many people who are building their PCs, you have the Windows, you have the OS drive, and then you have to drive with everything else.
7955223	7955443	I mean...
7958015	7975587	Well, excuse me for being a little bit of a nerd for a moment, but it's honestly one of the things that I like about the APFS format system is that if you're working in partitions, then they are dynamically resizing themselves.
7975587	7982392	So you would really just need one drive that would accommodate everything and use your dynamic format.
7986429	7989210	See, now you're gonna make me have to work, Ucchan.
7989210	7990931	You're making me work now.
7990931	7992251	I'm gonna write this down.
7992251	7993731	Turn it off, sorry.
7993731	7995092	No, it's okay.
7995092	7997032	It's okay.
7997032	8004395	They're in the process of updating stuff at work for people getting new Macs and new Lenovo, so it's gonna be fun.
8004395	8005915	Alright, sorry, I'm back now.
8005915	8008576	I've got my eye on an M2.
8008576	8011337	There are people that... What I was mentioning...
8019215	8021717	Okay, I just had my weird lag.
8021717	8022197	Sorry.
8022197	8023438	Yeah, no, it's it's fine.
8023438	8025680	But it creates awkward pauses.
8025680	8029523	I'm looking at some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
8029523	8033927	SheHulk10 says with all these stories, I think physical media will make a comeback.
8033927	8040372	QuestBuster is talking about the last physical PC game I bought was a successful Kickstarter years ago that promised one.
8040372	8041453	Ooh, that's good.
8041453	8045716	PodCulture says physical will go the route of vinyl records become a collector thing.
8045716	8047838	Well, you know what, they sell vinyl records at Target now.
8048078	8053601	So things have an interesting way of coming full circle, that's for sure.
8053601	8055662	All right, well, Ranma, go ahead.
8055662	8061605	I honestly feel that it's that it's media is going to be the norm from here on out.
8062833	8073976	The only thing is that there are like Japan's very much into physical media, which is why you can get games like that, even though the companies that are making the games would still prefer to have a digital distribution.
8073976	8080398	But like you still buy CDs, you still buy, you know, all of that.
8080398	8083579	All right, well, Ranma, is there anything else on your mind tonight before we let you go?
8084813	8086235	Last thing and then I'm gonna get out of here.
8086235	8087798	This one is for you, Rob.
8087798	8093588	This is something that you have brought up a few times before about how games do not come with instruction manuals anymore.
8093588	8096212	You just get the case, the game, and that's it.
8096212	8096753	Very rare.
8096753	8097173	Very rare.
8098214	8105741	I got here the Valis Collection 2 from Limited Run Games.
8105741	8107763	Look how thick that is though.
8107763	8109765	It's so thick, Ranma.
8109765	8111266	That's so thick.
8111266	8117232	That's a thick with three C's package you've got there in your hand.
8117232	8119053	Get your mind out of the gutter.
8119053	8120615	I'm talking about a video game.
8125936	8126736	I love you, Rob.
8126736	8127696	I love you.
8127696	8128296	You better.
8128296	8129757	Anyway.
8129757	8136098	So, when I got this, I always pop them open to see what all the cool swag that I have.
8136098	8141619	So, I popped open the game itself, and shocker!
8141619	8144760	There is an instruction manual in the friggin' box!
8144760	8146300	Huzzah!
8146300	8146800	No, it's cute.
8146800	8149941	And I'm just like, I go back through my other game, like, wait.
8150942	8157166	I think this is the first game I bought in several years where there's an actual instruction manual.
8157166	8162109	I'm just like, this is probably going to have to go in the museum and hang it right next to the castle.
8162109	8163890	Because it is collector's edition.
8163890	8164630	What is that collection?
8164630	8167232	That's why.
8167232	8171374	But still, I mean- Is that like, Valis 1 and 2?
8171374	8180160	This one is, no, it's Cid of Valis, original 8- Alright, Cid of Valis,
8181420	8187343	Valus IV, one of the original Valus games, and Valus the Phantasm Soldier.
8187343	8192065	So it's a couple, I guess, 8-bit renditions.
8192065	8192646	Oh, okay.
8192646	8193806	I know those.
8193806	8194407	That's cool.
8194407	8196027	That's cool.
8196027	8203111	I used to play Live in Daylight Saturday night when my local video store would have them for rental.
8203111	8206893	We still have the first two for TurboDuo.
8209244	8218894	That reminds me, I have to hit up Animate Japan, because a friend of mine picked up one of the Ranma 1.5 games for TurboDuo for like 800 yen.
8218894	8220476	Nice.
8220476	8225161	Alright, well, Ranma, enjoy your trip to Japan, and I can't wait to hear all about it.
8226550	8234978	Well, if y'all end up doing a show during the midweek next week, depending on the time, Mike.
8234978	8243146	I just stepped away because that was actually my dad that was calling, and I will stop the show when he calls because it might be an emergency.
8243146	8245248	Luckily, it wasn't an emergency.
8245248	8246028	He didn't realize.
8246028	8247830	He's like, your show goes on this late?
8247830	8248250	I was like, yes.
8248951	8253294	So he was he was letting me know that he has Christmas Eve plans with the other part of the family.
8253294	8255335	So I will be free, maybe Christmas Eve.
8255335	8258177	I still have to figure out what's going on with Alan's side of the family, just to make sure.
8258177	8264280	But if my Christmas Eve stays free during the day, then I'm totally down with it to do like a daytime show, I think would be fine.
8264280	8268043	So if not, we need to get some Panda Express.
8268043	8271785	Yeah, if nothing else, we can always do it New Year's during the day.
8271785	8271885	So
8273752	8274872	or New Year's Eve, whatever.
8274872	8276953	Anyway, but we'll work that out in the coming days.
8276953	8278933	So, all right.
8278933	8280153	Well, Ranma, have a great time.
8280153	8282794	And remember, pics or it didn't happen.
8282794	8284854	Oh, trust me, there'll be pics and videos.
8284854	8288515	Just understand, most of the pics will be the food that I eat.
8288515	8289355	I love food.
8289355	8290555	Yeah, put the food up.
8290555	8291135	All right.
8291135	8291795	Take care, my friend.
8291795	8292515	Thanks for calling.
8292515	8292915	You too.
8292915	8293536	I'll take care.
8293536	8294036	Love y'all.
8294036	8294456	Bye.
8294456	8295596	Bye.
8295596	8298917	Anime Jam Session, of course, Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
8298917	8300977	If you want to hear more Ranma and who wouldn't?
8302011	8305614	All right, again, I just want to give one more plug for the email bag.
8305614	8313420	Participate at orangelandtrader.com is the place to send your emails, but like instruction manuals, we see them so infrequently.
8313420	8315923	But feel free to show us your thick package.
8315923	8320106	I'm talking about collector's editions of video games, of course, in our mailbag.
8320106	8321527	Participate at orangelandtrader.com.
8322908	8326689	Um, other than that, I think we can wrap things up here tonight.
8326689	8329829	So we're going to get everybody's final thought tonight.
8329829	8331690	Uh, actually wait, I should check in real quick with Loki.
8331690	8333850	Any last minute stories?
8333850	8336170	I don't have any last minute stories.
8336170	8336510	Okay.
8336510	8337290	Well, that's fine.
8337290	8338131	I think we had a lot.
8338131	8339971	We had covered a lot of news tonight.
8339971	8341431	Uh, so we'll get final thoughts.
8341431	8345652	Uh, first off, thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and spending time with us tonight.
8345652	8348912	Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, please help us spread the word.
8348912	8351973	Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8352273	8354114	but we need more voices to put out on air.
8354114	8361336	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or wherever goes a very long way, so we really appreciate all of that.
8361336	8375221	We will be back in seven days to do this all over again with our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who should also be here fresh off of his on-stage events at DreamHack Atlanta, which I know is a pretty big deal, so I'm really excited to hear about how all of that went.
8375221	8380883	So we'll hear about that next week when VOG Network's programming starts live at 8 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Pacific.
8381403	8383245	Okay, we're gonna get final thoughts.
8383245	8385827	DarkSakura, I know you're not streaming tonight.
8385827	8388168	So we're gonna we're gonna visit somebody else instead.
8388168	8393332	But do you have some final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8393332	8398176	Um, yeah, just remember to take care of yourself.
8398176	8400778	Don't don't bite off more than you can chew.
8400778	8405562	And be kind to people because you really don't know what they're going through.
8405562	8406643	And this is for
8408733	8415657	on multiple sides of opinions of world events right now.
8415657	8424402	Just remember, a little kindness goes a long way and helps your cause a lot better than being a shithole does.
8424402	8425523	All right.
8425523	8427364	With that, we'll go over to Techmaster Loki.
8427364	8429705	Your final thought tonight.
8429705	8435989	Final thought is that I gotta do some editing.
8435989	8436609	All right.
8436609	8437650	Happy editing to you.
8438510	8440431	Oh shit.
8440431	8443072	My ballet recital is Saturday.
8443072	8443872	You got this.
8443872	8447974	You can do it.
8447974	8454717	My final thought tonight is some really exciting stuff being planned for next year on the hosting front.
8454717	8455578	I'm really excited.
8455578	8459399	So if you're ever in the area, I hope you'll stop by and see a show.
8459399	8460080	It's always a lot of fun.
8460620	8462180	Anyway, that's gonna do it tonight.
8462180	8467482	Have a wonderful night, everybody, and enjoy our special holiday ending, courtesy of DJRamaS.
