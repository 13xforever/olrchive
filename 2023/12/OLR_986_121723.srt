1
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:11,887
[SPEAKER_03]: MMOs have always brought you into their world.

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:15,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Sandbox games give you their tools to shape your own world out of their canvas.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:26,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortnite is increasingly blending the two, giving you a living world that isn't just scavenge, shoot, and survive, nor play in their sandbox, but also race and jam out when you want to, soon allowing you to pull your old plastic instruments out of their coffins.

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,130
[SPEAKER_03]: R.I.P.

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Metaverse.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,731
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Shooty Player One headline.

7
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:36,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of this week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice,

8
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:51,055
[SPEAKER_05]: hello my friends out there on the internet welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is orange lounge radio we are live once again tonight december the 17th of 2023 episode number 986 of our show

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,481
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here happy to be with you every single week and apologies if I sound a little off tonight.

10
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because I am I'm getting over some type of sick that's had me up and down since about Tuesday.

11
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:10,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So my voice is a little eh, so sorry about that.

12
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:15,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully, here to here to help carry the weight this week.

13
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:18,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:19,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey,

15
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:25,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, sorry to see your cam is broken tonight, but you are still represented with your PNG avatar.

16
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:27,322
[SPEAKER_05]: But how are you doing tonight?

17
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:32,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, it's a JPEG.

18
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing fine.

19
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:38,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my ballet recital last night.

20
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty pooped.

21
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've done nothing but sit on my butt all day.

22
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:47,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I played anything for an entire week.

23
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Dreamlike Valley, but like,

24
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:54,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the feels of sitting on your butt for an entire week, but it's, it's driving me bonkers.

25
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:57,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just kind of a nervous wreck all week too.

26
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now I like, I have no emotions.

27
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:02,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I, my emotion is potato.

28
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,832
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it nice to be, to be done with that and have that, like I did that.

29
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:11,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's how I feel about some of the like hosting things that sometimes make me nervous as I get on the other side of it.

30
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:12,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that wasn't so bad.

31
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:13,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did that.

32
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:14,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

33
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:17,861
[SPEAKER_02]: But think of this, your first time hosting.

34
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,933
[SPEAKER_02]: This was my very first recital ever.

35
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, God.

36
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:28,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think my first time hosting was at the Birdcage cinemas in front of a group of like 20 people.

37
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:29,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't that intimidating.

38
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:33,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe like the first time hosting a big show.

39
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like yeah, nerves.

40
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.

41
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:43,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's not just remembering what you're going to say, but making your feet and your hands do the same thing and not fall over and staying on your tiptoes.

42
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,438
[SPEAKER_02]: With a skirt that's too long for you.

43
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:45,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

44
00:02:46,696 --> 00:03:01,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was all that was going through my head was, remember to smile, don't fall over, don't step on the dress, you know how to do a pas de bourree, you know how to do an échappé, you know how to do this, and like, why is my leg not going up in the direction I want to?

45
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:02,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

46
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:03,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a pirouette.

47
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:06,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at the pictures, it looked like you did a solo number.

48
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a solo thing, or would the other people just kind of cropped out of the picture?

49
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:14,293
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a zoom in on a picture of a couple of us.

50
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:20,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but still I mean that can go because that means you have to kind of be in sync with the others and that's a whole other pressure to it.

51
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:23,299
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's kind of give and take on both sides.

52
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:33,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And but I feel like now that I've got that out from under me and December is apparently always the worst one for for learning routines because we had someone quit.

53
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yikes.

54
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:52,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, so we had to completely, not like a complete re-choreographing, but we had to restructure our choreography and take into account one few person for a Grand Allegro, for example, you know, not having someone be like the point of a triangle, for example.

55
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:56,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still managed to get the routine down in a month and

56
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to TechmasterLoki!

57
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:37,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a scary, it's like a scary jump scare game where you go and collect like scrap and you have to avoid all the monsters that are trying to do different things to you.

58
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it, is it like a...

59
00:04:40,373 --> 00:05:08,295
[SPEAKER_04]: like uh you know these these uh collection type of like survival build games i feel like are really in right now and like lego fortnite is just like exacerbating that whole thing is it kind of one of those type of games it's not it's not really a survival game i mean it is survival in the sense that you don't want to die but like um it's not like you're crafting things for yourself it's more of like you have to go collect loot from this procedurally generated

60
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:34,950
[SPEAKER_04]: building I guess and there's monsters in there and you have to each monster has like different ways that they behave and you have to kind of navigate that way to try to like and everything's dangerous hence the name lethal company the planet's dangerous there's dangerous mobs outside there's dangerous mobs inside it's just it's it's funny in the sense of how brutal it is

61
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:54,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun with multiplayer because when you're talking over voice chat they give you that kind of like walkie-talkie sounding voice and stuff when you're talking to each other.

62
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's like a filter over it.

63
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:02,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, things go wrong pretty fast.

64
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:03,019
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

65
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:03,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

66
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:06,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully everything's been going right for you personally.

67
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And things are going well.

68
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

69
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Any new posts on your YouTube channel as of late?

70
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,949
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was editing one today.

71
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:20,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been procrastinating this week, and by procrastinating it means I build more farms when I'm procrastinating.

72
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:31,853
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've been working on designing the ride systems for the first ride that I'm putting in my theme park, so that's taking time to design all that.

73
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:36,834
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, though, I've been filling out the basement area of my build with, I think, like,

74
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:43,155
[SPEAKER_04]: There's at least three, two more farms in there now.

75
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:45,296
[SPEAKER_04]: There was going to be three, but it didn't end up working.

76
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It blew itself up.

77
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:49,937
[SPEAKER_04]: But so that'll be coming in like a later video.

78
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:52,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I right now have been working on the Razeworks stuff.

79
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:58,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping to get it all done in one episode, but I've already got 30 minutes of just end rating.

80
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably just going to be the end.

81
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's going to be one more episode.

82
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,560
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the build that I did.

83
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:04,820
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

84
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we are going to get into this week's news.

85
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:15,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to give you all a quick schedule update before we get too far into the news.

86
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:25,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We do tape live this program, of course, every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

87
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:25,874
[SPEAKER_05]: But

88
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:35,440
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of changing up for the next couple weeks because of the unique nature of this show being on a Sunday and some pretty major holidays coming up the next couple weekends.

89
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,941
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do some schedule changes.

90
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:43,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So next week on December 24th, which happens to be Christmas Eve, we're going to be doing an early show.

91
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:46,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So and our pal Bobby Blackwolf is getting in on this too.

92
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:50,170
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bobby's going to start us off next weekend at 11 a.m.

93
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific, 2 p.m.

94
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Eastern, and we will follow that at noon Pacific,

95
00:07:54,953 --> 00:08:02,036
[SPEAKER_05]: 3pm Eastern with a special Orange Lounge Radio episode number 987 at earlier hours.

96
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:17,283
[SPEAKER_05]: If folks overseas I know it's still Christmas Eve so folks may still not be able to join us but I know some of our folks overseas in the UK this would be an excellent opportunity for y'all to jump in and listen live if you can but I understand y'all might have family obligations that come first completely respect that.

97
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:22,148
[SPEAKER_05]: New Year's Eve the next week, 1231, we will not be here at all.

98
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:29,275
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take that weekend off, and that week tends to be a very slow news week anyway, so it's not like there will be much to miss.

99
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:36,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We will join you once again at our usual time, 9 Eastern, 6 Pacific, on January 7th, I think the date is.

100
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,645
[SPEAKER_05]: when we come back from the holiday episodes.

101
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:54,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So once again, next week 987 early show, then a week off the 988 when we are back on a regular schedule in early January in the year 2024 if you can believe it the 22nd year that we will be broadcasting.

102
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:55,554
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

103
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:55,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

104
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Philof9 in chat says let's hope a new Nintendo console isn't announced then.

105
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not that week.

106
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:06,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, mid-January, anything's possible there.

107
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:11,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember when the Switch was announced, but I don't think it was... It was like mid-January or early February, I think.

108
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say it was like late January, early February.

109
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:18,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not to say we may not have some big news towards the beginning of next year.

110
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we want to be careful where to set our expectations.

111
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:23,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that comment was made very tongue in cheek anyway.

112
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:29,495
[SPEAKER_05]: But since people are thinking about the Nintendo successor and all that, you know, fun stuff, you know, it's something to

113
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:31,854
[SPEAKER_05]: keep an eye on.

114
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:41,416
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I wouldn't put any expectations until you know, maybe when we get halfway through next year, and we still haven't seen it, then we start going weird.

115
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:48,478
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because halfway through next year would be the time that this really big event in the gaming industry used to happen.

116
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And they kept saying, Oh, it'll happen again someday.

117
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:52,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll happen again someday.

118
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,899
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki, is that day ever going to come?

119
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:59,804
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's not going to come anymore.

120
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:09,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So they finally decided to basically confirm what everybody's been saying for the longest time, and that is that E3 is dead.

121
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:10,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It is officially dead.

122
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:11,973
[SPEAKER_04]: The ESA has said it's dead.

123
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:16,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, we know the entire industry of players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3.

124
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,418
[SPEAKER_04]: We share that passion.

125
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,060
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event.

126
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,246
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's the right thing to do given new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.

127
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:30,689
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, we don't need you anymore.

128
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:44,322
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to pay your fees to market themselves in a booth at your event and you've been irrelevant for years and now you're just, you know, yeah, I'm not, no one's surprised.

129
00:10:47,236 --> 00:10:48,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

130
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:49,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

131
00:10:49,437 --> 00:11:00,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think maybe for this one, I am going to defer my comments here to the great Wendy Williams, who said it best in this quick five second clip.

132
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

133
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:06,587
[SPEAKER_08]: She passed away.

134
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:08,509
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

135
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,949
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

136
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one was that?

137
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:12,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, she passed away?

138
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,995
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

139
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:17,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was thinking the death to all of them.

140
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:20,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, maybe, maybe, maybe before this announcement.

141
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, so, so here's the thing.

142
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:23,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

143
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:34,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, obviously, we've known this was coming for some time, especially, especially when like, Repop, keep in mind, they partnered with Repop, never produced anything in that relationship.

144
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:39,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Reidpop comes out and says the relationship is done with.

145
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:43,619
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like, if you couldn't tell then, I don't know what to tell you.

146
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:48,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we were saying on the show when that was announced, well, this show is already dead, like it's not happening.

147
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So this tweet is really confirming what we already know.

148
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, I'm not trying to make E3 happen.

149
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:55,348
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen much.

150
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

151
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

152
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:03,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not exactly taking delight in the fact that E3 is never coming back because you know what, we had some damn good years at E3.

153
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:06,581
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some damn good years at E3, especially, you know, like 2004, 2005.

154
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:08,183
[SPEAKER_05]: E3.

155
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:37,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumers were getting to see demos on the show floor and were not able to properly put in context that these were early builds.

156
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:50,753
[SPEAKER_05]: There were way too many people that were basing their opinion of an entire game off of an E3 show demo that was maybe recorded on some, you know, game store manager's camera that, you know, was put live on YouTube and so forth.

157
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:53,615
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the show was kind of going at one point.

158
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:53,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And I

159
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:58,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, because E3 kind of leaned into what the consumers wanted.

160
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the exhibitors wanted that anymore.

161
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:16,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And you really saw Sony kind of be the first to want to jump shark on that when E3 changed their tune the first time when they went to the airport hangar in the hotels in Long Beach in 2007, when Sony kind of threatened to quit E3 the first time.

162
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:22,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But I actually think one of the ESA's big mistakes was not calling Sony on their bluff.

163
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:29,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Sony was throwing a fit because of how poorly the PS3 was received, but it was kind of their own damn fault.

164
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:31,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Was their own damn fault, really.

165
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:36,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the ESA should have called them on their bluff, quite personally.

166
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did start to let everybody into that show without really properly screening people.

167
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:46,546
[SPEAKER_05]: The criteria they were using to screen people was not

168
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:50,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't match the times.

169
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:53,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, do you have enough people on YouTube to get here?

170
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:58,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, do you know that a lot of people get a lot of viewers on YouTubes by acting like dicks?

171
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:01,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying every YouTuber acts like a dick.

172
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Loki acts, no, I'm just kidding.

173
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:05,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Loki does very family-friendly content.

174
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,914
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki, like, let's have some real talk.

175
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:15,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever get frustrated at some, not all, do you ever get frustrated at some of the people who are the top Minecraft people and some of their shitty attitudes?

176
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever get frustrated with that?

177
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:24,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Attitudes... I mean, some people's content is certainly not for me.

178
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:38,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I feel there's a lot of stuff out there that... Yeah, it could be... Well, the YouTube algorithm will promote... What a lovely pageant answer.

179
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:45,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there are some people out there that are considered somewhat questionable because of things that they've said or...

180
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:58,745
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they stream on Kick now, so people just assume, you know, that they're, you know, they're cool with the races, people, you know, since there's a lot of those on Kick as well.

181
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:09,590
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, there's, I mean, outside of even just the Minecraft space, there's a lot of people on YouTube or TikTok or whatever that are just complete

182
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Wastes of human flesh.

183
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:27,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so So my point is is that ESA is really the ones that put on e3 set these arbitrary goals without asking the question How did people hit these numbers?

184
00:15:27,182 --> 00:15:35,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really and it just kind of showed that The viewers were the most important thing and not necessarily the editorial content of what they were going to say

185
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:41,694
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, that TryHard that keeps storming onto the stage.

186
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:48,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering how many followers they probably have, they would probably qualify to get into E3.

187
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:51,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were going to bring up the guy that took the camera in the bathroom.

188
00:15:55,986 --> 00:16:03,468
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole situation exacerbates exactly what I'm talking about.

189
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:06,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, points a big neon arrow at it.

190
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:12,150
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody had ever evaluated why is this guy popular, he should have never been let in the door in the first place.

191
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:17,748
[SPEAKER_05]: but the ESA was not really equipped to handle that sort of thing.

192
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:21,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it kind of did them in because they weren't able to evolve with the industry.

193
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:29,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's hard to say like having arbitrary requirements without actually having money and research into choosing those people.

194
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:32,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Also just don't let those people, you know, promote your game.

195
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:39,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause obviously people that are like teaming up with Dr. Disrespect anyways, um, it,

196
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:45,681
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a persona, if you will, but you know how he acts.

197
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:48,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're willing to still promote your game with him, then that's...

198
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,145
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of invite that.

199
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:56,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, like, you know, how, how would he get invited to an event like this?

200
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously he is, he is technically an influencer for like FPS games.

201
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:09,578
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people that agree with his opinions on that type of stuff, but he's also a bit, you know, unpredictable.

202
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:18,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously I wouldn't necessarily, you know, hitch my horse to someone that's been banned off of multiple streaming platforms, but

203
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:25,387
[SPEAKER_05]: whatcha gonna do I guess they wanted attention that's why Paris Hilton was at an E3 event

204
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,473
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, that was a little more on the publisher.

205
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:40,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But let me also ask this.

206
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:47,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that whole... I mean, I know it was a pain in the ass that year with the security and all that stuff, but was Paris Hilton going to E3 really the end of the world?

207
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:50,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this big scope of things really fucking matters.

208
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:51,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone cared.

209
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

210
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them waste the money to bring her into E3.

211
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:02,904
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ironic, though, because if Paris Hilton were to go now, I'd be like, oh, that'd be fun.

212
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:04,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go meet Paris Hilton.

213
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:04,845
[SPEAKER_05]: She's fun.

214
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:11,892
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, years can change your taste and your perceptions a little bit, that's for sure.

215
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:18,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw in chat says, if E3 ever comes back, it will be a name only when another company takes the name.

216
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:25,406
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's an interesting thing to consider is that the ESA may have to sell the name to pay off their debts because I don't know how the ESA survives this news.

217
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:29,388
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the ESA do for the industry other than E3?

218
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:37,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not going to repeat the same shtick we've done on the show before where we go to their website and I show you that the things they're talking about on their website are months out of date.

219
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:43,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not doing things that are visibly beneficial for the industry.

220
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:48,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they can't pivot to that sort of thing, I don't see the ESA lasting much longer than a year after this.

221
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Philof9 in chat says, but what is the state of gaming cons anyways, would you all say?

222
00:18:58,308 --> 00:18:59,509
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a con, though.

223
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,249
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trade show.

224
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:00,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

225
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,070
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

226
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,850
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 wasn't really a gaming con.

227
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,671
[SPEAKER_05]: People thought it was a gaming con.

228
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:06,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the trade show.

229
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

230
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the trade show calendar kind of just stays disrupted.

231
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:20,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have Game Developer Conference, and I think people just tend to go, you know, the actual developers and the networking part of it.

232
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I think GDC kind of picks up the slack of that.

233
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Gamescom picks up the rest of it.

234
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:53,781
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's always there's already summer games fest was kind of replaced it anyways and people are already doing their own events around that time so it's like summer game fest they've already replaced it like several years ago summer game fest still feels a little bit like checks mix where it feels like yeah it all comes together to do this thing but it's still like you know it's a pretzel and a piece of checks like it doesn't it doesn't really feel like it has that cohesiveness yet but i feel like now it might start to glue together a little more because i think

235
00:19:54,521 --> 00:20:00,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby points out there are industry trade shows around the world, just not in the U.S.

236
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,088
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore.

237
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:14,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think maybe Summer Game Fest will start to pick that up for the U.S., but I think Game Developer Conference kind of picks up a little bit more of the actual people who make the games kind of talking to each other sort of thing and networking.

238
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:23,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And one big thing is that I don't even think that maybe like high executives at, you know, at resellers or, you know, at stores should have, you know, been permitted in.

239
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,029
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that anyone under a corporate level

240
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:48,824
[SPEAKER_02]: should have been permitted to attend, honestly.

241
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:52,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I'm saying this as even us who went, we probably shouldn't have gone.

242
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:55,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not regretting having gone, but we probably shouldn't have gone.

243
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We were not the intended audience, really.

244
00:20:59,191 --> 00:20:59,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

245
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:05,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were the ones- I mean, I was in the intended audience when I was going, you know, through my work.

246
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:05,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

247
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

248
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't agree with that.

249
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:15,120
[SPEAKER_05]: But you personally knew how to judge what you were seeing.

250
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there were a lot of people at that level who didn't.

251
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe what they could have done was that if they were going to allow these corporate folks to go, there should have been some type of agreement and or training that basically like, hey, if you're going as a representative of this company,

252
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:35,370
[SPEAKER_05]: These XYZ things are okay to do and post on the internet.

253
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,932
[SPEAKER_05]: These XYZ things are not okay to do and post on the internet.

254
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:43,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as I know, there was not any type of, you know, it was just open season.

255
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:49,401
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who were intended to go probably didn't need training.

256
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:51,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

257
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:54,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But there should I mean, but there still should have been something documented to that purpose.

258
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:57,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Because obviously, we wouldn't be in this situation if it didn't.

259
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,369
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

260
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still don't see it.

261
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:14,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

262
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:20,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bobby in chat is pointing out GDC was for the technical side, E3 was for the publishing and marketing side.

263
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,527
[SPEAKER_05]: GDC doesn't want the marketers.

264
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:25,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know it.

265
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,390
[SPEAKER_05]: E3, yes, was mostly the publishing and marketing.

266
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:36,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you talk about like, think about how devs would still do a lot of like the post parties and hanging out and networking on that side of thing.

267
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:38,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Like E3 was really about networking.

268
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,077
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VoG Network, Ranma, Actdeft

269
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um, so there you go, some, an official update on something I think most of us kind of knew was happening anyway.

270
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:28,779
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess, I guess it's nice that it's out there so we can all agree that yes, E3 is now dead and we can all move on and see what, and now get answers to some of these questions about like what's next.

271
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:37,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Jeff Keighley and Summer Games Fest going to make a move to try to make the presence of Summer Game Fest a bigger show?

272
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:42,556
[SPEAKER_05]: A bigger, you know, presence that happens across multiple days and so forth, but who knows?

273
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:43,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

274
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:49,861
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on for now, though, and talk about what we have been doing this week, eulogizing or otherwise.

275
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to DarkSakura and ask, how was your gaming week?

276
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:54,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I did nothing.

277
00:23:54,164 --> 00:24:02,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I maybe played a little bit of Dreamlight Valley, but I didn't have the energy or inclination to stream.

278
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:12,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I maybe logged into Dead by Daylight a couple of times just to get my bonuses, but I didn't do anything.

279
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:13,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so frazzled.

280
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:19,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that that's over, I'm gonna get back into my usual stuff.

281
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I didn't do anything.

282
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:23,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you streaming tonight or waiting for tomorrow?

283
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:24,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am.

284
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

285
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:32,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I haven't done anything for the event, other than just log in and get points.

286
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:37,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to hop on that and get those, the tomes done.

287
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:39,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the tome, but the challenges.

288
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:39,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel really out of luck.

289
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:43,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played DVD since, I haven't played at all since Chucky came out.

290
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:48,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think maybe I played a couple things when Xenomorph was new, and that's about it.

291
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just kind of been distracted.

292
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Come play and throw snowballs with us.

293
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:53,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about tonight, but maybe because I just need to rest.

294
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:55,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's killer night for me anyway.

295
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:56,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe during the week.

296
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:57,364
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

297
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:58,464
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

298
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on to Techmaster Loki.

299
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:01,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, there is one thing.

300
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:02,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

301
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:12,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if anyone is interested in watching some DVD, Fixie and I are going to be playing together all day on the 27th.

302
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:13,191
[SPEAKER_05]: What day of the week is that?

303
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:13,911
[SPEAKER_05]: So Wednesday?

304
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Wednesday.

305
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:17,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.

306
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:17,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll double check.

307
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:18,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Christmas is Monday.

308
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:19,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Wednesday.

309
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:25,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Techmaster Loki.

310
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:39,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play a whole ton other than just Minecraft for the most part and building farms like I said underneath my base so that'll be probably part of whenever I film another episode of Channel 64 which hopefully will be soon.

311
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:46,051
[SPEAKER_04]: and keep putting it off just because I wanted to get more of the theme park stuff done.

312
00:25:46,051 --> 00:26:04,304
[SPEAKER_04]: But the theme park stuff, like starting with the rides, is a little bit involved because it requires, for the details I want to put in there, it's going to require some modeling of custom objects and stuff to build some animatronics and to

313
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:09,978
[SPEAKER_04]: build the actual game that's in the first ride.

314
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:17,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of was thinking maybe I will start with something that's not as involved, but no, that's just not the way I operate.

315
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:31,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So I may kind of showcase part of what I've been working on like in this new episode, but just cover basically all the farms I built underneath my base, which because that's probably enough to fill an episode anyways.

316
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty extensive.

317
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:33,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And then

318
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Outside of that, I've been playing a little bit more of the Playdates still.

319
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:51,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played a bit of Kraken's time travel adventure, which is the story of this robot who I guess is always late for his dates because he's asleep.

320
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:58,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you have to use the crank to kind of move him forward and backwards in time.

321
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:02,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, based off of his movements and stuff, you have to dodge

322
00:27:03,777 --> 00:27:22,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pretty harmless things but if you hit any of them then you lose and you never seem to get to your girlfriend on time either so you have to still be quick so you're not too late but you're always going to be late because you wake up at the time that he's supposed to be there which is kind of weird and it gets incredibly hard so I've been trying that

323
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:29,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a little bit of Boogie Loops is the other game that unlocked this week as well.

324
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:36,365
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's more just like a tracker, so I didn't really play with it too much because it's just making music, but it's neat.

325
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

326
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:46,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm debating whether I want to unlock all of the games because they've got a total of 24 that I just have to, you know, go down here and, you know,

327
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:50,098
[SPEAKER_04]: unlock them all early if I want to.

328
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:52,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise I get two a week.

329
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:52,939
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

330
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I may end up doing that.

331
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:56,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there was one other one, actually.

332
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think now what it was called.

333
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:06,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very much like Pole Position in the sense that it's like a pseudo 3D, pseudo 3D racing game.

334
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:09,004
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's called P-Racing.

335
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure.

336
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:13,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess P is polygonal because they kind of look like

337
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:16,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

338
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:29,509
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Pole Position, but it's not necessarily like that type of racing game.

339
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:34,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, you can race on tracks, but there's also more of like an open world type thing with like traffic and stuff.

340
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:40,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have like missions you can do and just the actual racing as well, but it looks really good.

341
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:42,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really good looking game.

342
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,741
[SPEAKER_04]: So I need to check that out.

343
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I still can't find

344
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:56,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone had said that there's a game that's like Scorched Earth on this and I have not found that and I've been looking for it because I love me some Scorched Earth, but...

345
00:28:58,743 --> 00:29:02,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know many golf games, so I may have to make one of those.

346
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:07,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly not anything that uses the crank to putt the ball like I was thinking.

347
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So that might end up working out.

348
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:13,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And looking at the catalog of games that they have, it's only four pages long.

349
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't have a whole lot of games on this platform.

350
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be worth it.

351
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:18,730
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

352
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

353
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:22,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Be curious to see if you decide to go anywhere with that or not.

354
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:22,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

355
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:41,034
[SPEAKER_05]: um okay well my gaming week so i've played a little bit um i've been playing world of warcraft classics specifically the season of discovery because you know i talked about i think in a prior week on the show they've kind of done some different things with the early levels of the game to really change up the characters and now you know uh shamans can tank

356
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:43,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Warlocks can tank, mages can heal.

357
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:44,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It's some interesting things.

358
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:45,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing a druid.

359
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my druid to level 25, which is the cap in the current game.

360
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So Miss Mu, my druid is 25.

361
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:53,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I rolled my first alt.

362
00:29:53,945 --> 00:30:02,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a new undead rogue named Senate Twink, who I got up to level five, I think something like that.

363
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:06,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, of course, somebody somebody in general chat because you know, you know, Warcraft players in chat.

364
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:08,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just thinking, Rob, I kind of miss my Tauren.

365
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Warcraft Classic is kind of fun, except I don't know if you would want to subscribe, because you have to have an actor in Warcraft.

366
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:38,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I don't like Classic Warcraft, I like Cataclysm Plus.

367
00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:40,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But her name, do you remember her?

368
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Calgirl, K-A-U-G-U-R-L.

369
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

370
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:52,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I will say that Cataclysm Classic is cuz so it's literally just Warcraft Cataclysm should be out.

371
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it's first or second quarter next year.

372
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:57,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might be a hard one to resist.

373
00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:03,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, I'm actually thinking about getting back in a normal WoW.

374
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:09,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I can play my Demon Hunter again, because I found lots of things to boundary break.

375
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:09,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

376
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:17,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, that was always my thing in WoW, was to go into the old raids and then bust out of the old raids and go exploring.

377
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:19,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Dragonflight's a pretty good expansion.

378
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:21,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard for me to play modern WoW.

379
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:23,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel overwhelmed now.

380
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,080
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so much.

381
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

382
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:24,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

383
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,383
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did enjoy Dragonflight, playing through it.

384
00:31:27,383 --> 00:31:31,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a much better expansion than some of the other recent ones.

385
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:33,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been interested in some of the characters they bring back for that.

386
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:39,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you know, basically I started playing when my man was out of the game.

387
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:39,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

388
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:41,363
[SPEAKER_02]: and NoMoreIllidan.

389
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:07,636
[SPEAKER_05]: like and then hooray.

390
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:14,659
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so I'm hoping they do another increased XP event around the holidays too, because that's what he did during Thanksgiving.

391
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:16,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was really good.

392
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,881
[SPEAKER_05]: So Phila9 says no one has started playing Lego Fortnite.

393
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of obsessed.

394
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:25,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've still been playing Fortnite Festival.

395
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:26,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Little bits here and there.

396
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:29,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Fortnite Festival is something I can play for hours and hours.

397
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:43,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I did do a stream of it on Thursday, and what I did to make sure that I didn't get a copyright strike, because I did the same thing I do with Spotify, is that I turned off the recording of my game audio to the archive.

398
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:52,111
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, if you go watch the archive, you're just going to hear me clacking keys to nothing, which is actually maybe kind of funny in its own way, because... Does it not have a stream remote?

399
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:52,491
[SPEAKER_05]: The audio...

400
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:54,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic Game Originals

401
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:12,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Lego Fortnite

402
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:29,851
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely see where it overlaps a little bit.

403
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:30,672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.

404
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:34,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I you know, and the fact that it's free, I'm not going to give it money.

405
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:34,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free.

406
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:37,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free is is pretty neat.

407
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:40,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy the fact that Fortnite is much more than Battle Royale now.

408
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:48,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's neat seeing these other things they can do with it, because I always thought it was interesting when they started doing these music videos and stuff in it, which was kind of the first sign of that.

409
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:48,449
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

410
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:51,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious to see what else they do with it.

411
00:33:51,552 --> 00:33:56,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played the racing game myself yet, but I watched some streamer friends play it, and it looked fun.

412
00:33:56,655 --> 00:34:02,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it looked like a pretty well, you know, it didn't look any worse than Disney Speedstorm, quite honestly.

413
00:34:02,578 --> 00:34:05,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, for a free game, it looked fun.

414
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I'm into the extra Fortnite stuff right now.

415
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:14,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I will probably be downloading Fortnite before the end of the year.

416
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:15,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Frown.

417
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:33,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of it this way, Bobby, and most people out there that are, you know, I, I'm not going to sit here and say Fortnite is without its problems, because the CEO of Epic Games, as much as I think he's made great contributions to the gaming industry, he's known to be kind of a twit on social media.

418
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,962
[SPEAKER_05]: But thankfully, it's a social media platform I don't keep tabs on anymore.

419
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:40,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's what I keep tabs on it, but I don't like actively read it anymore.

420
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:41,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever.

421
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:56,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But my point is, is that when it comes to Fortnite, if you can separate in your brain Battle Royale, which is what everybody calls Fortnite, but it's really now a game mode called Battle Royale or Battle Royale Zero Build.

422
00:34:56,754 --> 00:35:11,422
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can distinguish that from Fortnite Festival, like, you know, think of Fortnite as the platform and think of Battle Royale as the game now or Festival is the game or Jam Stage is the game and any of that stuff.

423
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:12,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Fork Knife

424
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Forknife, yeah, there's lots of niggas.

425
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:26,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwell says, does Save the World still exist?

426
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but not for free.

427
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:39,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's because that's the that's the mode that originally Fortnite was supposed to be before Battle Royale just kind of took over the industry.

428
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:41,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, Save the World is still in there, but you have to pay for it.

429
00:35:41,718 --> 00:35:42,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, you know.

430
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:44,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you gonna pay for it?

431
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,140
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

432
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:52,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um, I've also still been playing a little bit of Overwatch 2 because I have a friend that really loves playing it and likes to invite me to play.

433
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've been working on my game a little bit.

434
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like playing Lifeweaver.

435
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:58,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten a lot better with him.

436
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:00,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's like one of my favorite support characters right now.

437
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not like Kuroko.

438
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not like playing as her and I do not like playing as Brigitte.

439
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:08,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I know she's really powerful and OP.

440
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:09,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like playing as her either.

441
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my favorite support right now is Lifeweaver.

442
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:13,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten a lot better with Ana.

443
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:17,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Batiste, I play either Lifeweaver or Batiste.

444
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:19,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Batiste is phenomenal.

445
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:23,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially on some maps, I love being able to jump and do like his little heal bombs.

446
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:24,129
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of fun.

447
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:29,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I've been playing some Overwatch 2, mostly support but a little DPS as well.

448
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:34,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't resist picking Widowmaker and trying to live my best sniper life.

449
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:35,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm that guy.

450
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:36,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll admit it.

451
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:36,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So

452
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:40,878
[SPEAKER_05]: MikeDef says a good Ana can turn the tides of any match.

453
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:43,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, my buddy is really good at Grandma.

454
00:36:43,378 --> 00:36:44,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't call her Grandma.

455
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:46,179
[SPEAKER_05]: He's really good at Grandma.

456
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:49,340
[SPEAKER_05]: He can get like 10,000 heals in a match easy with Grandma.

457
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I'm always really impressed.

458
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,581
[SPEAKER_05]: So, because I can't get that high.

459
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:54,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done pretty good.

460
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:58,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I got like 7,000 with Batiste in a match not long ago.

461
00:36:58,522 --> 00:37:02,203
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, he also has the immortality field, which is more damage mitigation.

462
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, a lot of fun.

463
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:17,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um, let's get into some news and less about the games because yeah, I've been a little bit all over the map, but I'm hoping to catch up on a few things in my backlog this week, but we'll see.

464
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:20,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, let's get into some headlines.

465
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:23,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Phil of nine says Rob, you don't heal 500k.

466
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:27,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's I don't think Overwatch League players heal 500k in a season maybe.

467
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,831
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't I don't.

468
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:29,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in a match.

469
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:31,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you could possibly do that much.

470
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:32,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be surprised.

471
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:33,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can but I'd be surprised.

472
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:36,043
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's talk about some headlines.

473
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:42,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start off with this headline that they tried to sneak out at a time when we wouldn't be looking, right, Loki?

474
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:44,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday evening, yeah, that's right.

475
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:54,789
[SPEAKER_04]: So Activision Blizzard put out a statement basically saying that they've settled with the folks that are bringing up the

476
00:37:57,135 --> 00:37:58,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Gender Discrimination and Harassment Lawsuit

477
00:38:09,423 --> 00:38:19,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so basically they've reached an agreement with the California Civil Rights Department and that's the statement that they put out.

478
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:30,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it sucks that this doesn't necessarily go to trial to get all this stuff kind of out in the open and kind of figured this is the way it was going to go since

479
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,653
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're not going to want to drag this out into a legal battle because it's going to expose all of the wrongdoings that they've done.

480
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:43,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least, I guess the victims are getting some compensation from it.

481
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:55,280
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think they should have had to have this all come to light, because then at the very least, start cleaning up here and then set an example for other game companies.

482
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: That money should have come out of Bobby Kotick's golden parachute, but it won't.

483
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:20,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and thank you SSJ100 Matt with the countdown and chat reminding us 15 days left of Kotick in this industry and then Oh, and then of course, part of this as well as they're still denying the charges and you know, I don't think I think the settlement doesn't require them to admit fault if I remember correctly with some usually that's the case with these

484
00:39:21,353 --> 00:39:24,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure everyone is aware.

485
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:31,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure everyone is aware that is 100% legal speak, because you don't pay $54 million for something you didn't do.

486
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:43,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you don't know that there isn't something, you know, there to get they're avoiding a court of law for exactly what Loki is pointing out is that if it went to court, it would all come out in the public eye.

487
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And this $54 million is to stop that from happening.

488
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't have that happening.

489
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the same token say but nothing happened.

490
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:59,476
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know that's bullshit and the only, that's all legal speak, that is only to cover themselves legally, we all know it's bullshit.

491
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:01,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely.

492
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

493
00:40:03,977 --> 00:40:08,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm, I'm glad the company's being held accountable.

494
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:17,582
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm not glad about is not understanding where this money's coming from because I feel like this is why then Activision turns around and is the first company to charge $70 for games.

495
00:40:20,512 --> 00:40:23,534
[SPEAKER_05]: and is Microsoft now ultimately responsible to pay this money?

496
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:30,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess they know they bought damaged goods, so whatever, but do I as the gamer ultimately have to pay out this $54 million?

497
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:40,766
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be coming out of the board, Bobby Kotick, the people that are separating for this Microsoft merger should be coming out of their parachutes, 100%.

498
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:48,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I mean, you have to also look at too, you know, with the price of games being what they are now, it's like,

499
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're charging more for games, but are these games coming out more polished than they were before?

500
00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:03,434
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I would say for a lot of times, we hear about games coming out with roadmaps on how they're going to fix their game.

501
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:05,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We should never have to see that.

502
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:07,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It should just be working when it comes out.

503
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:35,513
[SPEAKER_04]: oh hey it's a it's a shell of what it's supposed to be it's an absolute mess and oh hey now our company has gone out of business that was something too that was uh you know earlier this week as well it's just like you you watch how these companies just mismanage this stuff and knowingly do that because i mean obviously when they put a game out and they know the state it's in there it's a gamble they're like well we'll just put it out so that we can hit our numbers but

504
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:41,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, the backlash won't be enough to, like, really hurt us, so we'll just... just do that.

505
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:52,938
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the analytics to prove that, like, even though they put out trash, that people don't do anything about it, so they can keep putting out trash and keep treating people the way they are.

506
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:54,579
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I want for Christmas?

507
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can pick whatever holiday you want, I'll pick Christmas.

508
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,921
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I want more than anything is... I want...

509
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:02,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Phil Spencer

510
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:29,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't happen.

511
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:29,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it won't.

512
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:30,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it won't.

513
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:32,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's because you know what?

514
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,491
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot about Christmas we're told that's a lie.

515
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:35,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is another one.

516
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:38,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can still want I can want it doesn't mean I'm going to get.

517
00:42:38,493 --> 00:42:39,293
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

518
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.

519
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:41,874
[SPEAKER_04]: You can want.

520
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:53,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Just QuestBuster does want to point out this 54 million is in addition to an 18 million settlement with the US Equal Employment and 35 million with the SEC earlier this year.

521
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, where is that money going to come from?

522
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And people wonder why women are so tired.

523
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired.

524
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:30,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired too.

525
00:43:30,364 --> 00:43:31,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

526
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:33,044
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

527
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:49,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and talk about Hey, some from several holiday seasons ago, you probably have accumulated a collection of plastic guitars and drum sets that are sitting in your spare bedroom or basement or garage that are collecting dust or maybe you're using them actively.

528
00:43:49,847 --> 00:43:51,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

529
00:43:51,148 --> 00:43:53,328
[SPEAKER_05]: But for fortnight festival,

530
00:43:53,948 --> 00:44:00,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like some controller support will be coming, perhaps a little sooner than you might think.

531
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:11,155
[SPEAKER_05]: PDP is a manufacturer of officially licensed controllers, and they put a post up on social media that says, Rock on this January.

532
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:16,777
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are emojis of a tent and a moon, which sounds like maybe Fortnite.

533
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:18,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Festival?

534
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:20,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows.

535
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:26,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic had previously stated that instrument controller support was being worked on as a priority.

536
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:36,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it sounds like this will be a new accessory, but if they can get the new accessory to work, certainly the old accessories are probably going to work as well.

537
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:40,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was part of the original reporting about Fortnite Festival was that

538
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:42,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm enjoying Fortnite Festival but I want to be clear

539
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:06,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy it in small doses, little bits at a time.

540
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:10,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I play like three songs and I'm like, okay, I had my fill for the day for a couple reasons.

541
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:14,632
[SPEAKER_05]: One, there's only so many songs that are available for free for a particular day.

542
00:45:14,632 --> 00:45:17,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And two, I'm not going to pay 500 V-Bucks for a song.

543
00:45:17,954 --> 00:45:22,137
[SPEAKER_05]: The price of a song to add to your collection permanently is way too high.

544
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:27,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're doing it because you get the song not just in festival, but you get it on the jam stage as well.

545
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:35,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's interesting where Fortnite is bringing us to this system where you buy unlocks that work in multiple things.

546
00:45:35,264 --> 00:45:36,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that's interesting.

547
00:45:36,885 --> 00:45:41,587
[SPEAKER_05]: But this whole like 500 V bucks for even for Lady Gaga, it ain't it.

548
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:42,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not worth it.

549
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:47,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So I they're gonna have to fix that pricing system if they really want to make money off this.

550
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know maybe there's

551
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they had the like already fixed.

552
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:52,092
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably there's probably whales out there.

553
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:53,653
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already buying anyway.

554
00:45:53,653 --> 00:46:02,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they were already having to reduce the price of like some of the vehicles that they were selling, because I think they were like 5000 V-bucks or something like that for a car.

555
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And they dropped it down to like... 4000 V-bucks for the car racing thing.

556
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:07,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

557
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:07,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

558
00:46:07,722 --> 00:46:13,366
[SPEAKER_04]: They dropped it down quite a little bit as well, because people were kind of like, what the hell?

559
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:15,107
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not buying it for that kind of money.

560
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:15,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

561
00:46:16,936 --> 00:46:21,199
[SPEAKER_05]: and Bobby does point out in chat, Fortnite is doing it without NFTs or the blockchain.

562
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:21,219
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.

563
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:23,020
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.

564
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do appreciate- How is that possible?

565
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:29,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was integral to the entire Web 3.0.

566
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:29,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

567
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:40,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, you know, if I may have a short list of reasons to appreciate Fortnite, but this is on that short list, is that they have essentially rendered the argument for NFTs pretty useless.

568
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:44,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen they've been useless this entire time?

569
00:46:44,074 --> 00:46:45,835
[SPEAKER_04]: This is shocking news.

570
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:46,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Shocking.

571
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:52,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, let's go to DarkSakura with another big update from this week.

572
00:46:52,337 --> 00:46:55,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So Naughty Dog has cancelled a game.

573
00:46:55,898 --> 00:46:59,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the multiplayer version of The Last of Us.

574
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:09,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So the project that they were calling The Last of Us Online has ceased development and they are

575
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:23,280
[SPEAKER_02]: They put up this whole discussion on how they came to it, especially given that they've had to reduce staff, as they say they had to.

576
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:32,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really wanted to make sure that it was a game that could keep people engaged for a long amount of time.

577
00:47:32,203 --> 00:47:35,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reassessment that they went through said that it wasn't worth it.

578
00:47:35,764 --> 00:47:38,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's on them.

579
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:47,333
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to turn all the remaining of the investment and staff into other projects.

580
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:52,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is probably The Last of Us 3, but we'll see I guess.

581
00:47:52,175 --> 00:47:53,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost The Last of Us.

582
00:47:53,815 --> 00:47:54,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

583
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:58,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know there were people that were kind of looking forward to what this could be.

584
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:06,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But there were also other people that were like, if they're just moving this to a games as a service type of thing, maybe maybe we're better off without this in the world.

585
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So I sort of feel like there's people that kind of fall in either camp.

586
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:17,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And questmaster in chat, I think with a very kind of respectful position here saying on this one, I respect Naughty Dog's decision.

587
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:22,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Supporting a live service game is no small task and admitting that it would affect what they are good at was interesting.

588
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

589
00:48:23,379 --> 00:48:24,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty transparent.

590
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,723
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't see that type of talk from a developer very often in this industry.

591
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,364
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll give it that.

592
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:33,007
[SPEAKER_05]: SGO100 Matt says, I'm sure elements and ideas will make its way onto a future game.

593
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:35,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they did sort of say that in their their message there.

594
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:37,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we'll see.

595
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,952
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see ultimately what comes of that.

596
00:48:39,952 --> 00:48:43,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Quest Buster does point out Sony's been pushing back on live service games.

597
00:48:43,595 --> 00:48:46,117
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to release 12 by 2026.

598
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:48,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're only aiming for six.

599
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:48,519
[SPEAKER_05]: You know,

600
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,381
[SPEAKER_05]: live service games are also they're like MMOs in a way.

601
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:57,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You only have time for so many of them in your rotation.

602
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:10,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Like and that was the hard lesson many people learned about MMOs is that when people invested all this time into something like World of Warcraft, it was going to take a lot for people to jump ship and play something else.

603
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:14,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And most that the time that World of Warcraft was most vulnerable.

604
00:49:14,804 --> 00:49:17,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know who did the damage to World of Warcraft?

605
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:24,546
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft did the damage to itself with some expansions that were pretty subpar.

606
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:29,849
[SPEAKER_05]: All the stuff that came out about Activision turned a lot of people off of Blizzard and so forth.

607
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:30,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And rightly so.

608
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:41,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what did that MMO in and ultimately led to a ton of people leaving for Final Fantasy XIV among other MMOs, Guild Wars 2 and all the stuff that's out there.

609
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:45,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to say those games didn't have people before then, but that was the biggest, you know,

610
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Boon for everything else.

611
00:49:48,061 --> 00:49:54,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't see how there's going to be room on the plate for everybody to do these games as a service game.

612
00:49:54,786 --> 00:50:00,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Quest Buster in chat says, I still wish Marvel's Avengers was more like a new X-Men Legends single player game.

613
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:06,314
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an excellent example of a games as a service game people didn't have time for.

614
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:08,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not up to a certain level of par.

615
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,817
[SPEAKER_05]: People didn't have time for that.

616
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:14,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now you see where it ended up.

617
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just yeah.

618
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:37,801
[SPEAKER_05]: As Joe and Matt though does point out, you know, as far as like the project getting canceled and turning into something else talks about, you know, if you want to go back to Blizzard when they were trying to make the next big MMO, which was Titan, Titan basically turned into Overwatch, you know, the pieces of Titan that they kept was what they made Overwatch out of essentially, it's making a long story very short.

619
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:45,363
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, so you know, maybe they're maybe they make a completely new type of game, a standalone type of game from whatever they were doing the last of us online.

620
00:50:45,623 --> 00:50:46,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, moving on.

621
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, and sometimes they end pretty suddenly.

622
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:10,985
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the case with Ubisoft's The Crew, which came out in 2014, and now it's just been delisted without any sort of warning.

623
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:22,331
[SPEAKER_04]: They say that its servers will shut off next year, and that's because, one, it had to do with, they quote, like, licensing and

624
00:51:23,972 --> 00:51:28,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the fact that it's also an almost 10-year-old game.

625
00:51:28,456 --> 00:51:43,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, we understand this may be disappointing for our players still enjoying the game, but it has become a necessity due to the upcoming server infrastructure and licensing constraints.

626
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:48,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine it would take much for them to keep the servers up, but also at the same time,

627
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:54,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is there not a single player version for this game?

628
00:51:54,409 --> 00:52:02,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny enough, there actually is a single player component for the game that people have found while digging through the code of the game.

629
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:08,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just they don't have it activated or it was never finished, but apparently it is a thing.

630
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is kind of unfortunate.

631
00:52:11,521 --> 00:52:28,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also one of those things that you have to look at with a live service game that requires you to be connected to a server is that when their licensing agreement just stops for whatever reason, this game is essentially useless.

632
00:52:28,451 --> 00:52:31,333
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot play it without those servers being up.

633
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:36,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe think about that before buying into a live service game.

634
00:52:36,857 --> 00:52:40,360
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, if I'm not mistaken, there's a Crew 2 and a Crew 3, right?

635
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's... Yeah, they have the Crew 2 and the Crew Motor Fest.

636
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:47,126
[SPEAKER_05]: So they probably figure a lot of their fans are on the newer games.

637
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:49,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Although... I understand that.

638
00:52:49,008 --> 00:52:50,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at EverQuest.

639
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:53,472
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't always go to EverQuest 2 just because it's a thing.

640
00:52:53,472 --> 00:52:58,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to be clear, there is a Crew 2 and a Crew 3.

641
00:52:58,076 --> 00:52:58,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

642
00:52:58,336 --> 00:53:00,698
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, it shouldn't be that these games...

643
00:53:01,824 --> 00:53:03,044
[SPEAKER_04]: are essentially useless.

644
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:07,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Like their if their argument is, well, just just just buy the new one.

645
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:08,586
[SPEAKER_04]: But why?

646
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:12,067
[SPEAKER_04]: You just showed me that you're going to shut this off at any given moment.

647
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:15,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I trust you with more money?

648
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:19,710
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for this game, like, I don't see why you would want to do that.

649
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:25,472
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it'd be like, you know, just get Forza Motorsports instead or something like that.

650
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,312
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that game's playable offline.

651
00:53:29,252 --> 00:53:31,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I wouldn't give Ubisoft more money.

652
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly that's not an excuse.

653
00:53:33,153 --> 00:53:41,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, you should just... You know, it sucks that we took your game away from you, so you know how you can reward us for that?

654
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:44,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Is by buying the next game, the newer one.

655
00:53:44,796 --> 00:53:47,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, we're not gonna turn that off right away.

656
00:53:47,216 --> 00:53:49,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a while, and then you'll buy another one of those...

657
00:53:50,257 --> 00:53:52,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, that's that's awfully nice.

658
00:53:52,298 --> 00:54:00,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds so much like Konami going, hey, you know, you're banned from these tournaments, but please still spend money with our products.

659
00:54:00,543 --> 00:54:02,124
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just silly.

660
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:17,038
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think you make another good case for why games as a service are very dangerous is that people invest this stuff into this and then, you know, here we are 10 years later, but they yanked the servers and now it's like whatever you invested into that is coming down.

661
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:20,221
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way to kind of save that and have that offline.

662
00:54:20,221 --> 00:54:22,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very, very few games do that.

663
00:54:22,282 --> 00:54:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember like Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst kind of embraced that and set a model for what it ought to be.

664
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:30,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, it very rarely ever is.

665
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:37,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And surely like they do market this game sort of as a MMO style game.

666
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:40,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that component of that.

667
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:43,595
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they also market it as a single player game.

668
00:54:43,595 --> 00:54:48,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So typically, when you think of a single player game, you don't think of online only single player game.

669
00:54:48,898 --> 00:54:53,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So that that's where I think that the advertisement of this game is a little

670
00:54:55,185 --> 00:55:02,831
[SPEAKER_04]: confusing on purpose, you know, so that people buy into it and then they don't realize, oh, this is basically like an MMO.

671
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:04,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it's done, it's done.

672
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:13,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny, because if this was 10 years ago, this would have been about the same time Diablo 3 came out and got a lot of shit for that same thing where it was always online and they ended up having.

673
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:21,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So when the console releases for that came out, you may remember it pulled the always online component to do the console releases.

674
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:21,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

675
00:55:21,807 --> 00:55:22,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they should have.

676
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:23,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

677
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:39,346
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they should have been working on with this and I get it like oh that will cost you some money and you may not necessarily recoup that money that you put into it but like being that they obviously knew when their licensing period was like they should have in the the

678
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:44,020
[SPEAKER_04]: to help promote game preservation.

679
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:50,442
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have at least fleshed out their offline mode that they clearly have built into the game.

680
00:55:50,442 --> 00:55:59,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there are screenshots showing people manipulated the game to re-add that back in there, where you can see, press X to play offline.

681
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:06,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if that component was built in there, or it needed to be built in there, I think that they should have patched that.

682
00:56:06,148 --> 00:56:07,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, hey, servers are going down, but you know what?

683
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:09,209
[SPEAKER_04]: You can enjoy this offline now.

684
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:17,726
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not doing that because why should they put money into something when they can try to get you to buy the newer product instead?

685
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:21,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's unfortunate that they just don't care about you as a customer.

686
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:25,993
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, well, we'd prefer you just bought our newer game instead.

687
00:56:25,993 --> 00:56:27,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Purchase more things with us.

688
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:38,708
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's move on and talk about some interesting stuff that happened on twitch.television this week, which is the site where we do our shows.

689
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:40,209
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is interesting.

690
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:48,336
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a policy update that happened a few days ago, about the sexual content policy, and there's a whole blog post that came with it.

691
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:56,459
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, oh, we get feedback from streamers that our current policies around sexual content are confusing, it can be difficult to know, da-da-da.

692
00:56:56,459 --> 00:57:11,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, we believe that accurate content labeling is key to helping viewers get the experience they expect, and now that we can enable appropriate labeling of sexual content using CCLs, we believe that some of the restrictions in our former policies are no longer required.

693
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:17,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the updated policies meant that some previously prohibited content was now allowed.

694
00:57:18,326 --> 00:57:22,228
[SPEAKER_05]: if the correct CCL content classification levels are used.

695
00:57:22,228 --> 00:57:39,394
[SPEAKER_05]: This would include content that deliberately highlighted breasts, buttocks, or pelvic region even when fully clothed, fictionalized nudity, body writing, and erotic dances involving disrobing or disrobing gestures.

696
00:57:39,394 --> 00:57:45,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Popular dances like twerking, grinding, and pole dancing were now allowed without a content label.

697
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what happened?

698
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:50,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what happened.

699
00:57:50,727 --> 00:57:51,967
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucked it up for everyone.

700
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:11,655
[SPEAKER_05]: caused confusion and appreciate all the feedback we've received.

701
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:16,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for always coming together with us to build the best version of Twitch.

702
00:58:16,457 --> 00:58:21,199
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, upon reflection, we decided we went too far with this change.

703
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:27,101
[SPEAKER_05]: The platform has admitted there's been difficulty with individual depictions of nudity because of AI.

704
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:37,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So effective today, we are rolling back the artistic nudity changes and moving forward, depictions of real or fictional nudity won't be allowed on Twitch regardless of the medium.

705
00:58:39,364 --> 00:58:43,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, guys can go without their shirt.

706
00:58:43,966 --> 00:58:45,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Not on Twitch, they can't.

707
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:45,646
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they can.

708
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:46,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they can now.

709
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:48,367
[SPEAKER_05]: That policy changed a long time ago.

710
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:58,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And trust me, there's streamers out there where it's like half the stream is the shirtless guy and then like behind them is whatever game they're playing.

711
00:58:58,029 --> 00:59:06,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some women that still play like, yeah, they're wearing a top, but it's cut in a very strategic place that are doing the exact same thing.

712
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:09,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But they still can't remove it and be topless.

713
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,726
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they can't remove it and be topless.

714
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:22,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, yeah, it's it's a big double standard and especially just goes to show how, you know.

715
00:59:22,494 --> 00:59:31,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Anally clenched our society is about nudity, where we can have violence all day and all night and no one gives a shit.

716
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.

717
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:33,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Murica.

718
00:59:34,764 --> 00:59:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and always also remember at the end of the day, people are going to watch like the things that are popular are because you watched it, you know, you meaning the collective audience of the internet are watching these these types of things.

719
00:59:48,194 --> 00:59:56,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, if you aren't a fan of these streamers that are really the focus is on themselves, and not the game that they're playing.

720
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,482
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what it comes down to is the focus on themselves, not the game that they're playing.

721
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:00,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't watch them.

722
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:16,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's well it's right in the line and it really I mean I agree about the whole violence thing too like that should be if it's incredibly violent gameplay or footage that you're seeing that should also be kind of gated off separately as well.

723
01:00:16,514 --> 01:00:27,882
[SPEAKER_04]: The main problem originally was that this stuff was being promoted on the front page like these streams so like you hop in like you don't even have to be signed in to Twitch and it's just like

724
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:33,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's softcore pornography, basically, on the front page.

725
01:00:33,851 --> 01:00:41,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get it, the double standard that's in there, but you also have to understand, they don't really care what the users think.

726
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:42,614
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not at all.

727
01:00:42,614 --> 01:00:44,254
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what happened with this?

728
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:54,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because the credit card processors probably came down on them, or the ad providers came down on them after this just went free-for-all for less than 24 hours.

729
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:56,658
[SPEAKER_04]: They saw what it looked like, and it's still

730
01:00:57,458 --> 01:01:21,558
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much like that like the certain metas that are out there are still there and you know clearly it is for a specific reason they're trying to skirt that line to you know do that and that's fine if they want to make that type of content a thing that they have on their site it should be separated off from the rest of the content like it shouldn't be considered

731
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:35,728
[SPEAKER_04]: just chatting or gaming it's certainly not gaming at that point but like it should be separated off so you can have your own channel where that type of content exists and then age gated if you will um

732
01:01:37,285 --> 01:01:37,485
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

733
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the problem is where are they going to draw the line fairly?

734
01:01:59,442 --> 01:02:13,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think when this was put into place, then it was causing people that, you know, were playing mature rated games or whatever to, you know, fall off the front page and that type of stuff where they kind of felt like that wasn't fair because maybe the game isn't rated appropriately or whatever.

735
01:02:13,988 --> 01:02:15,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, where do you draw the line?

736
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:17,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You're asking, then Twitch becomes the morality police.

737
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,070
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we do?

738
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, certainly.

739
01:02:20,371 --> 01:02:27,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you're always going to have people there and try to skirt the rules to push whatever they want.

740
01:02:27,755 --> 01:02:30,437
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a problem with content moderation.

741
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:36,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, that takes people to do that or algorithms, I guess.

742
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,462
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just.

743
01:02:39,462 --> 01:02:41,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to be a problem.

744
01:02:41,403 --> 01:02:43,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And even when they, you know, have these

745
01:02:45,114 --> 01:03:07,139
[SPEAKER_04]: rules in place like assuming that they kept them like people that are streaming that may be just large chested not necessarily trying to like accentuate that as part of like their persona online you're not trying to use that to like it's just that's just who they are and they're just wearing comfortable clothing you know there's a difference between you know

746
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:24,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone wearing comfortable clothing and just gaming and just hamming it up with their audience and somebody that is cutting their camera just below, so it looks like they're topless, whether they are or not, you know, just to skirt by the rules because it says, well, you can't show any of this.

747
01:03:24,472 --> 01:03:30,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to cut that part, just going to be right below the camera, you know, and then.

748
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:34,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at that point, it's like, what is this?

749
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know what your like target demographic is here.

750
01:03:38,123 --> 01:03:45,669
[SPEAKER_04]: You're obviously trying to, you know, bait with sexual content to try to get people to donate for different things.

751
01:03:45,669 --> 01:03:48,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And that that doesn't belong in the site, in my opinion.

752
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:53,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It belongs on another type of site that that caters to.

753
01:03:53,035 --> 01:03:59,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is a live there is a live streaming site that full on allows nudity.

754
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

755
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,441
[SPEAKER_05]: because I've seen it linked to on blue sky.

756
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:05,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think it was called joystick.

757
01:04:05,363 --> 01:04:07,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be wrong.

758
01:04:07,304 --> 01:04:09,946
[SPEAKER_05]: But somebody somebody was advertising.

759
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is how I found out is I was on a random feed.

760
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:14,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on like the gamer feed or somebody and somebody was like,

761
01:04:15,149 --> 01:04:17,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm going live and I'm playing such and such a game on my feed right now.

762
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:18,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.

763
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:18,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And they linked to it.

764
01:04:18,992 --> 01:04:20,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, I think the site was called joystick.

765
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I've never heard of this site.

766
01:04:22,614 --> 01:04:23,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a new like streamer?

767
01:04:23,695 --> 01:04:28,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went to their, I went to the stream and they were playing the game.

768
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:29,238
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

769
01:04:29,238 --> 01:04:31,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And not wearing any clothes.

770
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, Oh, it's that kind of site.

771
01:04:36,503 --> 01:04:38,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly, I was like, I'm surprised I hadn't heard of it before.

772
01:04:39,725 --> 01:04:59,115
[SPEAKER_02]: But on top of that too, I mean, we're also dealing with societal conditioning, you know, if it hadn't been that, you know, certain reproductive elements of human anatomy were considered also to be naughty, then, you know, people wouldn't have a stick up their ass about it.

773
01:04:59,115 --> 01:05:01,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's society.

774
01:05:01,957 --> 01:05:02,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

775
01:05:04,182 --> 01:05:05,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, all right.

776
01:05:05,383 --> 01:05:07,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, yeah, I'm not jealous of Twitch.

777
01:05:07,805 --> 01:05:10,026
[SPEAKER_05]: These are very difficult waters to navigate.

778
01:05:10,026 --> 01:05:13,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you give people an inch, they're going to take a mile.

779
01:05:13,929 --> 01:05:17,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And essentially, they're having to play the morality police a little bit.

780
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:20,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it wouldn't be a problem if they were one.

781
01:05:22,342 --> 01:05:39,433
[SPEAKER_04]: They enforce the rules evenly is the main problem because you have you have folks that have straight up film pornographic content live on Twitch and got a temporary suspension on their channel and they just came right back.

782
01:05:39,433 --> 01:05:42,115
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, but somebody who might

783
01:05:43,143 --> 01:05:51,891
[SPEAKER_05]: just tangentially have their OF as a link on the sidebar because that is also something they get into.

784
01:05:51,891 --> 01:05:53,652
[SPEAKER_05]: They should not be penalized for that.

785
01:05:53,652 --> 01:05:54,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I understand.

786
01:05:54,813 --> 01:05:56,735
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't make that the focus of your stream.

787
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:01,739
[SPEAKER_05]: But if that is just, hey, here's one other place you can find me and give me money if you like.

788
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:10,847
[SPEAKER_05]: If that is where somebody chooses to monetize, that should not be penalized and somebody should not be withheld from the front page because they they tangentially have another side business.

789
01:06:12,287 --> 01:06:17,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least now they're, you know, not so sticky on cross streaming.

790
01:06:17,529 --> 01:06:27,293
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a while, though, I think that had a little bit more to do with competition, with advertising a competition.

791
01:06:27,293 --> 01:06:27,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

792
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:30,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little bit less than the nature of Blink.

793
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,654
[SPEAKER_05]: plus so many people were doing it anyway.

794
01:06:34,654 --> 01:06:36,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a hard thing to play, especially on the affiliate level.

795
01:06:36,856 --> 01:06:39,037
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many people that were just doing it anyway.

796
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:46,562
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get away with it a lot with TikTok because their biggest competitor really that they were worried about was YouTube.

797
01:06:46,562 --> 01:06:50,245
[SPEAKER_05]: If we all run an area 52 at once, they can't get us all.

798
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:53,467
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

799
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when that was the thing?

800
01:06:54,688 --> 01:06:54,928
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

801
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on.

802
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:58,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Something a little more lighthearted, please.

803
01:06:58,691 --> 01:06:59,131
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

804
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:04,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, excuse me.

805
01:07:04,703 --> 01:07:06,423
[SPEAKER_02]: SEGA.

806
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:13,125
[SPEAKER_02]: They have trademarked a number of classic franchises.

807
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:16,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, their own classic franchises.

808
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:26,088
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have trademarks as of December 6th for Altered Beast, Eternal Champions, Jet Set Radio, and Kid Chameleon.

809
01:07:27,188 --> 01:07:39,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, we knew that they were doing a Jet Set Radio with Crazy Taxi and Golden Axe and Streets of Rage and Shinobi, but now we have a couple more, so... Who knows what's gonna happen?

810
01:07:39,696 --> 01:07:45,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe they're just kind of bookmarking it for future use if these other games do well.

811
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:47,341
[SPEAKER_05]: They have places to grow into, you know?

812
01:07:47,341 --> 01:07:50,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be that kind of thing, yeah.

813
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:51,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's interesting.

814
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:52,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a game in that universe.

815
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:09,288
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat says a new Altered Beast would be nice.

816
01:08:09,288 --> 01:08:12,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how they would approach it if it plays like the original but in 3D.

817
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:13,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

818
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:14,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It could still be in 2D.

819
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:20,531
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot, like look at, I know you love your Ninja Turtles, TigerClaw, so why not like a Shredder's Revenge?

820
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Altered Beast could come back like that.

821
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:29,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the, just take what was great about the, you know, when everybody loved the Ninja Turtles game, like the arcade game, right?

822
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:33,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a game that really like kind of celebrates that and focuses on that.

823
01:08:33,436 --> 01:08:36,337
[SPEAKER_05]: but just kicks it up to, you know, the current year.

824
01:08:36,337 --> 01:08:37,278
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

825
01:08:37,278 --> 01:08:39,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love an alternate beast in that kind of.

826
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:41,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the Sega Ages 2500 series?

827
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of those things.

828
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:43,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

829
01:08:43,861 --> 01:08:47,683
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would like to see something like where it's just zhuzhed up a bit.

830
01:08:47,683 --> 01:08:48,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

831
01:08:48,463 --> 01:08:51,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the Sega collection on 3DS, was that the same collection?

832
01:08:51,764 --> 01:08:54,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Because those games were so good.

833
01:08:54,045 --> 01:08:54,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

834
01:08:54,626 --> 01:08:55,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

835
01:08:55,266 --> 01:08:56,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they did like some.

836
01:08:56,387 --> 01:08:59,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were Sega Ages on 3DS or whatever it was.

837
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:00,648
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good.

838
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:01,529
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just love to see that.

839
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:07,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you played that version of Fantasy Zone I have.

840
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:08,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really good.

841
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:10,556
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just good old Fantasy Zone.

842
01:09:10,556 --> 01:09:11,417
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

843
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:14,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sometimes it's fun to just zhuzh up the classics.

844
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:19,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, speaking of 3DS, I loved the version of Kid Icarus they did on 3DS.

845
01:09:21,008 --> 01:09:27,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they just it was very similar to the eight bit version, but it supported the different screen ratio.

846
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:42,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just like all the 3d effects were, were like the different layers on different, like, z axis, basically, like, you know, like things in the background where the bar and it was it worked, it was very effective.

847
01:09:42,488 --> 01:09:42,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved it.

848
01:09:46,778 --> 01:09:51,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish Nintendo did this with their classics so much more.

849
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of us do.

850
01:09:53,180 --> 01:10:02,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost criminal how much Nintendo abandons their old classic library, but it's a topic for another day I guess.

851
01:10:02,603 --> 01:10:04,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, back to the modern stuff.

852
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:19,712
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I guess this was bound to happen sooner or later, but A24 has announced that they're going to be doing a Death Stranding movie.

853
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not surprised it's them.

854
01:10:21,853 --> 01:10:29,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Kojima Productions said that the movie won't just be a direct translation of the game.

855
01:10:29,295 --> 01:10:31,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there wouldn't be enough time.

856
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:33,356
[SPEAKER_05]: The opening is as long as a fucking movie.

857
01:10:34,988 --> 01:10:45,038
[SPEAKER_04]: um yeah so uh the only way i saw this is that they were selling an A24 Death Stranding shirt on i think

858
01:10:46,155 --> 01:10:51,459
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on A24's website is actually how I saw that this was a thing.

859
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:58,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm curious to see more about it when it comes out and hopefully it makes sense because I mean, I didn't understand.

860
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:05,630
[SPEAKER_05]: A24 has a lot of credibility and rightfully so, like they put out some really fucking interesting movies.

861
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:10,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So just that partnership alone is got a lot of people excited, that's for sure.

862
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:16,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw says, I wonder if they can get the same actors from the game for the movie.

863
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:22,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if they're trying to make something different, though, a great place to start might be casting different people.

864
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:27,347
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise, otherwise, people are always going to make that connection.

865
01:11:27,347 --> 01:11:28,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Norman Reedus.

866
01:11:28,548 --> 01:11:34,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a good gag would be focus on different people in the movie.

867
01:11:34,071 --> 01:11:38,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe Norman Reedus shows up at the end type of thing, you know, like tie it that way.

868
01:11:38,755 --> 01:11:43,018
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe put the focus on, you know, I'm sure there's lots of stories to tell within that world.

869
01:11:43,018 --> 01:11:44,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe put the focus somewhere else.

870
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:44,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

871
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:45,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a thought.

872
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:45,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a thought.

873
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,001
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's a lot of things they could do with it.

874
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:52,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to trust the process and hope it turns out OK.

875
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:53,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'll be exciting.

876
01:11:53,430 --> 01:12:03,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but if Hideo Kojima is actually creatively involved with it, won't they have to split it into like three movies?

877
01:12:03,859 --> 01:12:09,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a TV series where every episode is two hours long and there's like 24 episodes.

878
01:12:09,343 --> 01:12:09,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

879
01:12:12,034 --> 01:12:13,175
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

880
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:21,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, on a very sad note, especially for this time of year, I'm really sad to continue to report layoff stories.

881
01:12:21,465 --> 01:12:28,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, layoffs are still hitting the industry, even during the holiday season in December.

882
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,034
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D Realms

883
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:33,578
[SPEAKER_05]: was hit with Embracer layoffs.

884
01:12:33,578 --> 01:12:36,981
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D Realms, of course, you know, they've made games.

885
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:38,862
[SPEAKER_05]: They go all the way back to like Duke Nukem, right?

886
01:12:38,862 --> 01:12:47,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But a little more recently, the Kinderman Remedy, Kingpin Reloaded, and Ion Fury Aftershock was one that had a bit of traction there.

887
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But half the company has been laid off.

888
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:56,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Embracer Group acquired 3D Realms in 2021, only to lay off half the studio this past week.

889
01:13:08,749 --> 01:13:24,386
[SPEAKER_05]: On a similar note, the studio behind TimeSplitters' Free Radical Design also closed their doors last week, another hit within the Embracer group.

890
01:13:24,386 --> 01:13:28,491
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember though, in this case, the original iteration of Free Radical fired from

891
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:36,716
[SPEAKER_05]: excuse me, filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and it came back as Crytek UK and Dambuster Studios.

892
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:48,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in 2021, Embracer Group came in, rounded up the key staff that was around from the Free Radical Days to work on reviving TimeSplitters, but none of that matters now.

893
01:13:48,504 --> 01:13:54,668
[SPEAKER_05]: If you actually go to freeradicaldesign.co.uk, you will get a

894
01:13:55,248 --> 01:13:56,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is so sad.

895
01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:58,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna actually show this on the other screen.

896
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:59,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how well this will translate over.

897
01:13:59,692 --> 01:14:06,858
[SPEAKER_05]: But you actually get a message that comes up on the website that says 404 company not found.

898
01:14:06,858 --> 01:14:07,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Frown emoji.

899
01:14:07,358 --> 01:14:09,420
[SPEAKER_04]: That's horrible.

900
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,981
[SPEAKER_05]: That hits me right in the fields.

901
01:14:10,981 --> 01:14:12,462
[SPEAKER_05]: That's terrible.

902
01:14:12,462 --> 01:14:14,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It is terrible, but clever.

903
01:14:14,764 --> 01:14:17,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, props to the person that did that on their way out.

904
01:14:17,326 --> 01:14:22,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, I will say that whoever found the time to do it like and like did that on their way out.

905
01:14:23,868 --> 01:14:45,289
[SPEAKER_05]: props to you because that's ow ow right in the feels good all right honestly it's a nice little f you a little bit yeah it's I don't know if I would say f you or yeah I guess I guess it is f you it's just it's also like hello depression anyway

906
01:14:46,437 --> 01:14:54,171
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's let's try to lighten up the mood a little bit with a segment here that always takes a look back at when things maybe were a little more fonder in our industry.

907
01:15:04,818 --> 01:15:12,569
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

908
01:15:12,569 --> 01:15:15,954
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

909
01:15:15,954 --> 01:15:18,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright DarkSakura, what did you pick this week?

910
01:15:19,611 --> 01:15:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked FireShark, and I have done its predecessor, which was FlyingShark, that we also got on NES's SkyShark.

911
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:30,961
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love FireShark.

912
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:33,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I love both of those games, to be perfectly honest.

913
01:15:33,623 --> 01:15:34,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're freaking Toaplan.

914
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:37,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you love Toaplan.

915
01:15:37,846 --> 01:15:39,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say Toaplan.

916
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fun to say Toaplan.

917
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:42,570
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

918
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to step away for just a moment to hydrate, but I will turn it back over to you.

919
01:15:46,590 --> 01:16:04,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so at any rate, Fire Shark is a vertically scrolling shooter that came out, it was published by Toaplan in Japan in 1989 and then also by them in Europe and by Romstar in North America.

920
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:07,563
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, it's the sequel to Flying Shark, aka Sky Shark.

921
01:16:09,004 --> 01:16:13,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pretty awesome game.

922
01:16:13,126 --> 01:16:22,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's set in 1991, where there is a mysterious armada launching a worldwide attack from the Mediterranean.

923
01:16:22,151 --> 01:16:25,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you fly a biplane in 1991.

924
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:42,742
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, it was an in-house port to the Mega Drive slash Genesis and published worldwide by DreamWorks, Toaplan, and Sega between 1990 and 1991.

925
01:16:42,742 --> 01:16:45,004
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a few changes on the console release.

926
01:16:45,004 --> 01:16:52,691
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a conversion for the Sharp X68000 that never did get released.

927
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I mean, it was just like...

928
01:16:57,375 --> 01:17:01,961
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well in the west, but not as much in Japan because it was pretty hard.

929
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:14,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, of course, you know, kind of like a military theme.

930
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:22,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a, you know, very reminiscent of the 1940 series of games.

931
01:17:22,044 --> 01:17:31,990
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to fight, like, tanks and kamikaze planes and artillery and ships and other crap.

932
01:17:33,059 --> 01:17:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Strange Fleet Armada.

933
01:17:35,681 --> 01:17:42,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got different weapons that you can get as icons as you destroy these zeppelins.

934
01:17:42,026 --> 01:17:45,468
[SPEAKER_02]: A laser beam, a wide shot, or a flamethrower.

935
01:17:45,468 --> 01:17:51,432
[SPEAKER_02]: You also get speed boosts, you get extra bombs, you get P and 1-ups.

936
01:17:51,432 --> 01:17:57,696
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get three P's in a row, then it increases your firepower one level.

937
01:17:57,696 --> 01:17:59,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the third being the highest.

938
01:18:00,018 --> 01:18:04,804
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you just like fill the entire screen with just bleh.

939
01:18:04,804 --> 01:18:05,905
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I'm going to describe it.

940
01:18:05,905 --> 01:18:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Just just you're pissing fire all over the screen.

941
01:18:10,694 --> 01:18:19,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you have, depending on your settings for the arcade version, you also can use a checkpoint.

942
01:18:19,098 --> 01:18:25,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're downed and you have to start over, you respawn from your checkpoint.

943
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:30,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if you get hit by an enemy, you lose life and can decrease your firepower.

944
01:18:30,763 --> 01:18:35,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the arcade, you can put more money in to keep on playing!

945
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:41,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 10 stages, and it loops back to the first one after you have completed the last stage.

946
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:43,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very tour plan thing.

947
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:46,666
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it gets a lot more, uh, bloody.

948
01:18:48,517 --> 01:19:17,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one thing that was pretty cool about this game, and I think it's just one of the things that makes the game look really, really nice, is that, um, the artwork, a lot of the artwork in the game was hand-drawn, um, and then, uh, transposed-to-pixel art, um, it just, it gave it a really good, really good, uh, um, you know, look to the game, and they,

949
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:40,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted this to also sort of serve as a successor Like there's a there's like different weapons that this one is successor to weapons from other games like the blue laser from Truxton You know the the flamethrower is of course new But they wanted things

950
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:45,828
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to sort of keep it in the family of games.

951
01:19:45,828 --> 01:19:54,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were settling on the word, which I'm guessing would be same and not same.

952
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:58,737
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were saying they wanted to put out the same strengths.

953
01:19:58,737 --> 01:20:03,700
[SPEAKER_02]: The word same would be shark in Japanese.

954
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:08,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wanted to keep the shark name anyway.

955
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:08,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, language is fun.

956
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:17,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it was released by Toaplan in Japan on November 2nd, 1989, and then in Europe, uh, the same year.

957
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:23,856
[SPEAKER_02]: North American release was by RomStar, uh, March, uh, 1990.

958
01:20:23,856 --> 01:20:32,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, there was an album of the music, and the music was done, uh, by, uh, excuse me, um,

959
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:41,412
[SPEAKER_02]: by Yuge Masahiro, and the art was done by Nako Gashintaro.

960
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:43,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really beautiful stuff.

961
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:46,253
[SPEAKER_02]: The music in this game is great, very just energetic.

962
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:55,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a full, an album that was released by Skytron and Pony Canyon.

963
01:20:55,155 --> 01:21:00,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, October 1990, Toaplan released Fire Shark.

964
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:07,306
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was released in North America by DreamWorks as a division of Toy Soldiers.

965
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:13,314
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, it was very faithful to the original.

966
01:21:13,314 --> 01:21:21,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have harder difficulty settings, but it did have a smaller color palette, so they had to redo some of the sprites.

967
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:31,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, there was an x68000 version in development that was supposed to be published by Kaneko.

968
01:21:31,267 --> 01:21:36,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did advertise it pretty heavily, but it didn't get released to market.

969
01:21:38,897 --> 01:21:57,643
[SPEAKER_02]: The port was re-released later by Retro-Brit in 2020, and in 2022, the arcade version was included in the Hisho Same Same Same compilation for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as M2's Toaplan Arcade Garage.

970
01:21:57,643 --> 01:22:02,645
[SPEAKER_02]: The original was also included in the Sega Astro City Mini-V,

971
01:22:04,723 --> 01:22:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, but as far as its ratings when it was released, it got really high ratings.

972
01:22:15,689 --> 01:22:19,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40.

973
01:22:19,491 --> 01:22:24,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Computer and Video Games gave it 90% for the Mega Drive.

974
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:27,715
[SPEAKER_02]: EGM for the Mega Drive gave it a 33 out of 40.

975
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:32,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it got some pretty, pretty good reviews.

976
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a German magazine called Power Plague that compared it with 1943, the Battle of Midway and Vapor Trail hyper-offense formation, which are pretty apt reviews.

977
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:50,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole military theme and having like all kinds of special weapons that shouldn't have existed in that environment.

978
01:22:51,119 --> 01:23:11,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but yeah, as far as, um, other things, uh, the rights to FireShark and the other Toaplan IPs are owned by a company called Tatsujin, which is, uh, it was named after Trexton's Japanese title, uh, Tatsujin.

979
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:16,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was founded in 2017 by Yuge.

980
01:23:16,964 --> 01:23:24,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're affiliated with an arcade manufacturer, XA Arcadia.

981
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:34,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And in other influences, SuperXYX, it was influenced stylistically by Fireshark.

982
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

983
01:23:37,307 --> 01:23:43,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I actually didn't know a lot about this game so it looks like a lot of fun though.

984
01:23:43,293 --> 01:23:46,977
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it every so often at California Extreme.

985
01:23:46,977 --> 01:23:53,123
[SPEAKER_02]: It was there a couple years ago and I think I just like didn't get off of it because I was like there's fire everywhere.

986
01:23:53,123 --> 01:23:55,185
[SPEAKER_02]: The flamethrower weapon was clearly my favorite.

987
01:23:55,325 --> 01:24:04,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, and I agree with what Questposter said in chat about, I love the art direction for games like this that pair terrifying flame cannons that reach across the screen to a tiny biplane.

988
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:11,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, there's just something about this era of shooter games that is excessive and wonderful.

989
01:24:11,774 --> 01:24:16,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Just freaking tattoo the Toaplan logo on my butt or something.

990
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:18,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Careful what you ask for.

991
01:24:18,578 --> 01:24:20,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, because no one's going to pay for you to do that.

992
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:22,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I know an artist that could do it.

993
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,721
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to pay for me to do that.

994
01:24:25,586 --> 01:24:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to pay for it.

995
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the holidays.

996
01:24:29,388 --> 01:24:30,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other things.

997
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:32,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a dare?

998
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:35,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to have the Toaplan logo tattooed on my butt.

999
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have something else tattooed on my butt.

1000
01:24:37,412 --> 01:24:38,472
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1001
01:24:38,472 --> 01:24:40,953
[SPEAKER_05]: A butt tattooed on your butt?

1002
01:24:40,953 --> 01:24:42,194
[SPEAKER_02]: A butt-shaped tattoo.

1003
01:24:42,194 --> 01:24:42,834
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1004
01:24:42,834 --> 01:24:43,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1005
01:24:43,635 --> 01:24:45,175
[SPEAKER_02]: With a butt on it.

1006
01:24:45,175 --> 01:24:47,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back and I'm- It's butt-ception.

1007
01:24:47,777 --> 01:24:50,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I get the Beavis and Butthead reference.

1008
01:24:50,962 --> 01:24:57,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back and I'm hydrated and it's this actually does relate to the show because I'm drinking a particular beverage.

1009
01:24:57,024 --> 01:24:59,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say the name because they're not sponsoring us.

1010
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:09,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to say their name on the podcast, but it's a beverage that I drink and I can't not think of DarkSakura when I drink this beverage because it's the P word.

1011
01:25:09,949 --> 01:25:10,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1012
01:25:10,809 --> 01:25:16,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because it's it's something that we used to drink when we played DDR all the time.

1013
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:18,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stand those drinks anymore.

1014
01:25:18,472 --> 01:25:19,392
[SPEAKER_02]: They taste slimy.

1015
01:25:19,392 --> 01:25:20,072
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel slimy.

1016
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:49,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently I've just been all about water when I'm dancing, but in the morning when I make my coffee, I use potassium drops and echinacea drops.

1017
01:25:49,962 --> 01:25:55,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like, I don't want to get sick, but I don't want my water to taste like salt.

1018
01:25:57,549 --> 01:26:00,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even like Pocari Sweat anymore, but Dan drinks that up.

1019
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

1020
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:07,091
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, like, I'll drink regular tap water, but I get, I, yeah, I get bored of it.

1021
01:26:07,091 --> 01:26:17,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, I like to use, I still use the little, like, infuse, again, I'm not naming names, but I use little infusers that you put a little bit in it and it just adds a little bit of... I'll name a name.

1022
01:26:17,293 --> 01:26:19,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I still drink that, that Mio stuff.

1023
01:26:19,313 --> 01:26:21,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Target has like a generic brand of that.

1024
01:26:21,534 --> 01:26:22,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll use that.

1025
01:26:22,354 --> 01:26:23,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1026
01:26:23,394 --> 01:26:27,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll drink whatever people want to send me free samples of too.

1027
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:33,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I have so many different samples of sports drinks that I got at TwitchCon.

1028
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:37,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Careful what you wish for, because I think the mailbag has yet another email contact.

1029
01:26:37,391 --> 01:26:38,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I deleted all that.

1030
01:26:38,012 --> 01:26:38,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1031
01:26:38,312 --> 01:26:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I think somebody's desperate.

1032
01:26:40,172 --> 01:26:46,375
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, literally if someone does want to sponsor me, I'll be like, yeah, your drink's adequate.

1033
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:50,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, what a rousing advertisement.

1034
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:54,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it clearly worked because I have to pee.

1035
01:26:54,698 --> 01:26:55,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me run an ad break.

1036
01:26:56,604 --> 01:26:59,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't run an ad break now or you might miss some rapid fire news!

1037
01:27:27,338 --> 01:27:30,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, is called Friday the 13th Jason's Doom.

1038
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:37,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a total conversion or I guess map pack whatever for I'm sorry, I have to derail for a minute.

1039
01:27:37,364 --> 01:27:38,904
[SPEAKER_05]: The game that's playing in the background there.

1040
01:27:38,904 --> 01:27:41,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that person wielding a stop sign as a weapon?

1041
01:27:41,886 --> 01:27:42,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they are.

1042
01:27:42,446 --> 01:27:44,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me more about this.

1043
01:27:44,107 --> 01:27:46,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down for that.

1044
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:50,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looked like they were wielding a stop sign and then they put it down and then they picked it up again.

1045
01:27:51,568 --> 01:27:58,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, so right here in this part is where you have to pay the monster.

1046
01:27:58,132 --> 01:27:59,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really see it.

1047
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,454
[SPEAKER_04]: You pay them to get money.

1048
01:28:01,454 --> 01:28:03,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a quota you have to meet.

1049
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:06,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you hit the bell, there's like a little service bell there.

1050
01:28:06,097 --> 01:28:09,999
[SPEAKER_04]: If you hit it too many times, the tentacles come and kill you.

1051
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:14,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But you basically put the stuff you're trying to sell on the counter there, and then you hit the bell.

1052
01:28:15,905 --> 01:28:16,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1053
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:22,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too many times because otherwise you will die because it is lethal company.

1054
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:23,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1055
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:26,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like the idea of beating people up with a stop sign.

1056
01:28:26,072 --> 01:28:27,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop!

1057
01:28:27,573 --> 01:28:28,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop!

1058
01:28:28,994 --> 01:28:30,695
[SPEAKER_04]: There's monsters in the game.

1059
01:28:30,695 --> 01:28:31,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's all sorts of things.

1060
01:28:31,735 --> 01:28:33,877
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like spider-headed things.

1061
01:28:33,877 --> 01:28:35,178
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1062
01:28:35,178 --> 01:28:38,139
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like one of the streamers, DarkSakuraWatches, plays it.

1063
01:28:38,139 --> 01:28:39,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So I need to check it out, I guess.

1064
01:28:39,841 --> 01:28:41,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you need to check it out for sure.

1065
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:41,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good time.

1066
01:28:42,542 --> 01:28:48,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway, sorry, back to Doom meets Friday the 13th because I was interested in that too until I got distracted.

1067
01:28:48,685 --> 01:28:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it is still a work in progress, but you can check out the current progress on it already.

1068
01:28:56,427 --> 01:29:00,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can download it still and be able to play it.

1069
01:29:00,189 --> 01:29:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it is essentially the Friday the 13th NES version.

1070
01:29:06,499 --> 01:29:10,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Fully fleshed out in 3D, which is crazy with the old retro graphics.

1071
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:12,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to check it out.

1072
01:29:12,564 --> 01:29:12,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

1073
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:14,145
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a threat.

1074
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:15,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1075
01:29:15,686 --> 01:29:29,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in another fan created piece, you know where this is going, but a fan decided to do a fan made port of Link's Awakening to PC and Nintendo struck it down.

1076
01:29:30,097 --> 01:29:32,379
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's what they do.

1077
01:29:32,379 --> 01:29:37,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel that they did this the correct way in the sense that they put it out.

1078
01:29:37,963 --> 01:29:42,806
[SPEAKER_04]: What was kind of unique about this is so they put this on itch.io for a bit.

1079
01:29:42,806 --> 01:29:47,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually had the full map was active all at one time.

1080
01:29:47,289 --> 01:29:53,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could actually zoom all the way out to see the full map or zoom all the way in and play it that way.

1081
01:29:53,754 --> 01:29:54,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked awesome.

1082
01:29:54,835 --> 01:29:57,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a clip of this on social media and I was like, dang, this looks cool.

1083
01:29:58,137 --> 01:30:07,011
[SPEAKER_04]: But being that they did the smart thing, which is they finished it, then put it out, and then it got struck down, it's on the internet.

1084
01:30:07,011 --> 01:30:10,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should be able to find it somewhere.

1085
01:30:10,135 --> 01:30:11,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully.

1086
01:30:11,678 --> 01:30:12,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to check it out.

1087
01:30:13,339 --> 01:30:13,599
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1088
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:37,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney Illusion Island has a free content update called The Keeper Up.

1089
01:30:50,282 --> 01:31:07,385
[SPEAKER_02]: and it has a new Mavens of Monoth Time Trials feature, and just different accessibility features, gallery unlocks, a new map, and yeah, and I've actually never heard of this game.

1090
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:10,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cute.

1091
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:11,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've heard Bobby talk about it.

1092
01:31:11,601 --> 01:31:13,141
[SPEAKER_05]: He plays- I don't like the art style.

1093
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:18,043
[SPEAKER_05]: He's played it with, uh, Jennifer and he, he thinks it's a good game that, uh, for them to play together.

1094
01:31:18,043 --> 01:31:19,603
[SPEAKER_05]: They enjoy their time playing that.

1095
01:31:19,603 --> 01:31:21,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I, it- I really don't like the art style.

1096
01:31:21,424 --> 01:31:21,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

1097
01:31:21,864 --> 01:31:22,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it looked cute.

1098
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:23,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not at all.

1099
01:31:23,364 --> 01:31:38,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, it's one of those things where it's like, if I only had time to play every single game I wanted to play, I'd play this, but you know, it's just- And also, I think I don't like it in the same way that I don't like, like the newer Transformers animated art style.

1100
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:38,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1101
01:31:40,103 --> 01:31:41,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1102
01:31:41,904 --> 01:31:43,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll play it if you won't.

1103
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:44,786
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1104
01:31:44,786 --> 01:31:52,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, moving on, I want to talk about Oh, this this is fascinating to me because they have found a new cheat code for a game from 2009.

1105
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:55,774
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember cheat codes?

1106
01:31:55,774 --> 01:32:02,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, before all of our systems connected to the internet by default, and people figured out that you could sell things that way.

1107
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:06,822
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have cheat codes in games where you would have like button presses and you can unlock things.

1108
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:08,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And just this week,

1109
01:32:09,051 --> 01:32:16,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It was found that in the Gran Turismo port for PlayStation Portable, that's PSP.

1110
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:19,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Loki, remember olrpsp.com?

1111
01:32:19,097 --> 01:32:19,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1112
01:32:19,457 --> 01:32:20,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

1113
01:32:20,418 --> 01:32:23,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the PSP, 14 years after this game came out,

1114
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:26,357
[SPEAKER_05]: This cheat code has been found.

1115
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:33,064
[SPEAKER_05]: The cheat codes, they unlock all the cars in the game and award the player 99 million credits.

1116
01:32:33,064 --> 01:32:36,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are both things that would be microtransactions in this day and age.

1117
01:32:36,307 --> 01:32:39,231
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the wild thing of this.

1118
01:32:39,231 --> 01:32:45,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So the user on the subreddit and gtplanetboards, pes2k, I love that name,

1119
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:46,238
[SPEAKER_05]: and

1120
01:33:10,828 --> 01:33:14,070
[SPEAKER_05]: You unlock all the cars so you can test all the cars.

1121
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:19,894
[SPEAKER_05]: You give somebody 99 million credits so you can test all of those features without having to play through the game like that.

1122
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:24,577
[SPEAKER_05]: These were probably things that were buried deep into the game and never came out.

1123
01:33:24,577 --> 01:33:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So all you need to do to unlock all the cars, you hold down star and select and R and go up, right, left, left, square, up, right, right, up, triangle, right, up.

1124
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:40,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that would have been found completely on its own.

1125
01:33:40,207 --> 01:33:41,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty complicated thing.

1126
01:33:43,223 --> 01:33:45,864
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you found that Link's Awakening?

1127
01:34:10,758 --> 01:34:15,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I found the fork of it too.

1128
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:17,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make sure that you get it.

1129
01:34:17,962 --> 01:34:22,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I haven't gone looking for it yet, but just oh, it's on archive.org.

1130
01:34:22,905 --> 01:34:24,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Quietly and privately.

1131
01:34:24,305 --> 01:34:27,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just send it to me on DM.

1132
01:34:27,087 --> 01:34:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Just slide into my DMs and send me some link.

1133
01:34:29,508 --> 01:34:30,509
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1134
01:34:30,509 --> 01:34:37,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's travel around the world and check out some releases for those of you that are not going to the dark.

1135
01:34:37,993 --> 01:34:38,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Black.

1136
01:34:39,249 --> 01:34:43,292
[SPEAKER_05]: World Wide Web.

1137
01:34:43,292 --> 01:34:45,673
[SPEAKER_05]: What's coming out for you this week?

1138
01:34:45,673 --> 01:34:46,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot.

1139
01:34:46,854 --> 01:34:49,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as expected.

1140
01:34:49,196 --> 01:34:53,919
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got Resident Evil 4 on Mac and iOS.

1141
01:34:53,919 --> 01:35:00,923
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Princess Maker 2 Regeneration on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1142
01:35:00,923 --> 01:35:04,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a game called One.

1143
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:07,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's on PC.

1144
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:07,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1145
01:35:09,341 --> 01:35:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, it is a little bit slower a time of year.

1146
01:35:12,663 --> 01:35:15,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, but things are still trucking right along in Japan this week.

1147
01:35:15,304 --> 01:35:21,508
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Nintendo Switch, we have 2045 Tsukiyori in a regular and limited edition coming out.

1148
01:35:21,508 --> 01:35:27,051
[SPEAKER_05]: DC5, Decapo 5, also in regular and limited edition on the Switch this week in Japan.

1149
01:35:27,051 --> 01:35:30,373
[SPEAKER_05]: The Curse of Kudan comes out in Japan this week.

1150
01:35:30,373 --> 01:35:38,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Spy X Anya, Operation Memories is also out in Japan this week, as well as Fitboxing Presents Hop, Step, Dance.

1151
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:39,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Hop Step Dance

1152
01:35:49,298 --> 01:35:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Rail Romanesque Origin also out in regular limited edition in Japan this week.

1153
01:35:53,762 --> 01:36:03,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Sentimental Deathloop also out this week and one in a regular, you guessed it, limited edition because we love our limited editions in Japan.

1154
01:36:03,129 --> 01:36:08,193
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PlayStation 5 this week, Baldur's Gate 3 gets a release in Japan on the PS5.

1155
01:36:08,193 --> 01:36:09,594
[SPEAKER_05]: That game's kind of a big deal.

1156
01:36:09,594 --> 01:36:11,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also a multi-language edition.

1157
01:36:11,156 --> 01:36:15,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm assuming that means they have some additional voice acting talent to support other languages.

1158
01:36:15,499 --> 01:36:16,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out.

1159
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And that same Spy x Anya

1160
01:36:19,142 --> 01:36:25,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Anya, Operation Memories, also out in Japan this week.

1161
01:36:26,038 --> 01:36:31,240
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1162
01:36:53,973 --> 01:37:16,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, we were just talking about leaks and stuff like that, and how Sony got hacked, and not necessarily directly Sony, but Insomniac Games has been hacked, and as part of that, some of the materials that were leaked from that kind of allude to games that are being worked on.

1163
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:32,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, some of the names that came out from Insomniac Games there was some planned projects including Miles, RCE, SM2, SM3, and then one that's called...

1164
01:37:34,059 --> 01:37:42,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It says additional support for Spider-Verse and Spider-Dash or whatever is one that's listed there.

1165
01:37:42,085 --> 01:37:50,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So the thought is perhaps were they working on a Spider-Verse game, which I hope they are because that would be amazing.

1166
01:37:53,348 --> 01:38:02,113
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, not too surprising to see that there's other Spider-Man games in development at Insomniac, obviously, because it's a successful franchise for them.

1167
01:38:02,113 --> 01:38:05,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Spider-Verse game, I'd be down for that.

1168
01:38:06,328 --> 01:38:11,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's a neat direction for them to go in than to just like Spider-Man 3, you know what I mean?

1169
01:38:11,614 --> 01:38:13,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'd be kind of a neat thing for them to do.

1170
01:38:13,056 --> 01:38:25,230
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of did that too, like there was like, I don't remember who, it was back in Activision when they had the Spider-Man license, they used to do a lot of these different games that were just like the

1171
01:38:26,411 --> 01:38:53,403
[SPEAKER_04]: great Spider-Man games tied in with the movies a little bit but then eventually they kind of spun off things to different like kind of they almost have like a spider-verse game I'm trying to remember what it's called it's like Shattered Something I don't remember but yeah it would be really cool to see that especially the art style is just amazing so if they were able to recreate that in-game it would just be it'd be

1172
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:57,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Just absolutely game of the year.

1173
01:38:57,917 --> 01:38:59,438
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1174
01:38:59,438 --> 01:39:02,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, DarkSakura.

1175
01:39:02,259 --> 01:39:04,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, me.

1176
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:14,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, um, the Super Mario Brothers movie has been nominated for some Golden Globes.

1177
01:39:14,566 --> 01:39:20,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the three awards are Best Animated Movie, Best Original Song, and Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.

1178
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:22,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yay!

1179
01:39:23,346 --> 01:39:25,247
[SPEAKER_02]: and Y'all can watch it and let me know how it goes.

1180
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:52,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Golden Globes are kind of, I don't know, they've always been like the fun awards, but people also kind of try to look at them as like a barometer for the Oscars.

1181
01:39:52,525 --> 01:40:00,731
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's weird to talk about the Mario movie and Oscars, but I would assume two of these three categories, because the third doesn't exist.

1182
01:40:00,731 --> 01:40:03,773
[SPEAKER_05]: The cinematic achievement thing isn't really an Oscar category.

1183
01:40:03,773 --> 01:40:06,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a category added to get more people to watch the Globes.

1184
01:40:06,355 --> 01:40:07,275
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what that is.

1185
01:40:07,275 --> 01:40:11,578
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would assume, honestly, that the Mario movie is a shoe in for those other two categories at the Oscars.

1186
01:40:11,658 --> 01:40:11,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Oscars

1187
01:40:33,982 --> 01:40:34,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Barbie Songs

1188
01:40:49,372 --> 01:40:57,717
[SPEAKER_05]: when the Mario movie with Bob Hoskins came out, that we would be sitting here talking about an Oscar nomination years later for the Mario movie in any form.

1189
01:40:57,717 --> 01:40:59,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's pretty, pretty astounding.

1190
01:40:59,879 --> 01:41:08,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, Tigerlaw does bring up a good point is that if Peaches does get nominated, you would likely get a performance of it at the ceremony.

1191
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:12,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's suggesting that Jack Black can perform the song while wearing a Bowser costume at the Oscars.

1192
01:41:15,227 --> 01:41:21,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Not outside the realm of possibility, and if you want to talk about things that will get people watching, I think that would be super cute.

1193
01:41:21,212 --> 01:41:28,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think all of the unnominated songs this year, because I think the Barbie performances, I think people would really want to see that too.

1194
01:41:28,578 --> 01:41:33,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Because actually, Billie Eilish was on SNL last night, if I remember right.

1195
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:36,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she did do the sad Barbie song.

1196
01:41:36,065 --> 01:41:38,467
[SPEAKER_02]: SNL is on my shit list.

1197
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it was...

1198
01:41:40,839 --> 01:41:41,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Animated Movie

1199
01:41:58,327 --> 01:42:00,668
[SPEAKER_05]: and probably a couple Disney movies.

1200
01:42:00,668 --> 01:42:08,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe... I could see it maybe winning Best Animated, but I think that's its best shot at actually winning anything at the Oscars.

1201
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:09,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out.

1202
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:16,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Oscar noms are out in early January, if I remember right, if they're still on the same timetable they used to be before COVID, so we'll see.

1203
01:42:16,753 --> 01:42:19,573
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, a couple more stories for you.

1204
01:42:19,573 --> 01:42:21,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, I think this one's hilarious.

1205
01:42:22,737 --> 01:42:24,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1206
01:42:24,278 --> 01:42:39,904
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you give to those wonderful gamers out there that play a lot of Steam games but are also complete dicks when it comes to playing Steam games, especially those who cheat in Dota 2?

1207
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:43,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you give them gift-wrapped bands.

1208
01:42:43,665 --> 01:42:45,026
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1209
01:42:45,026 --> 01:42:47,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently they were...

1210
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:57,772
[SPEAKER_04]: They were sending out, I want to say it was like a gift-wrapped lump of coal to these different players.

1211
01:42:57,772 --> 01:43:05,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually, they had opened it and it says, oh, you're banned.

1212
01:43:05,694 --> 01:43:07,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it was great.

1213
01:43:09,366 --> 01:43:12,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Holidays, you're banned.

1214
01:43:12,328 --> 01:43:20,092
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a Twitch streamer who has a clip from it and it's like, you've claimed a seasonal reward, a highly toxic lump of coal.

1215
01:43:20,092 --> 01:43:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Dota account has been permanently banned for smurfing or other violations of the Steam Terms of Service.

1216
01:43:28,096 --> 01:43:28,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh ho ho.

1217
01:43:31,718 --> 01:43:34,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.

1218
01:43:34,799 --> 01:43:36,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I love when they have that.

1219
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:41,881
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been people streaming and getting that live on their stream, right?

1220
01:43:41,881 --> 01:43:45,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what meeting they came up with that in, but kudos to them.

1221
01:43:45,542 --> 01:43:48,763
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the spirit of the holiday season.

1222
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:51,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Owning some cheaters.

1223
01:43:51,144 --> 01:43:53,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1224
01:43:53,265 --> 01:43:54,305
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1225
01:43:54,305 --> 01:43:55,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1226
01:43:55,446 --> 01:43:55,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to see it.

1227
01:43:56,331 --> 01:44:06,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, lastly here on our official show roll tonight, we have a pretty cool story about the efforts to preserve our industry in the years moving forward.

1228
01:44:06,303 --> 01:44:15,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, so often we have stories that talk about how, you know, like the story about the crew tonight, about how video game preservation in many ways takes a step backwards.

1229
01:44:16,195 --> 01:44:17,196
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is very cool.

1230
01:44:17,196 --> 01:44:24,880
[SPEAKER_05]: The VGHF, or Video Game History Foundation, is going to be opening a digital version of its research library.

1231
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:33,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Through this digital library, it will have near-complete sets of magazines, art books, and rare historical materials.

1232
01:44:33,444 --> 01:44:40,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get excited thinking about that rare historical material stuff because, you know, and I've talked about how cool I thought this game was a lot on this show.

1233
01:44:40,748 --> 01:44:45,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry if I'm sounding like a shill, but The Making of Karateka, the Gold Master Series game,

1234
01:44:46,031 --> 01:45:05,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought some of the coolest stuff in that game was like actually getting to see like design documents and like letters that went back and forth between the publisher and Jordan Mechner who developed that game that really gave you a look behind the scenes for like how games were made in that era and like some of the actual feedback that was coming in on games and stuff like that.

1235
01:45:05,858 --> 01:45:09,019
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, magazines and hype is one thing.

1236
01:45:09,019 --> 01:45:10,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's like, oh, God.

1237
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's here's here's the I'm sorry to to

1238
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:15,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Divert a little bit.

1239
01:45:15,322 --> 01:45:19,524
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm looking at the YouTube picture here, and I'll put it up on the other screen.

1240
01:45:19,524 --> 01:45:28,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those on the podcast feed, it's the it's the the Video Game History Foundation announcing their digital library here.

1241
01:45:28,028 --> 01:45:31,989
[SPEAKER_05]: But I noticed in the background, there's this player's strategy guide.

1242
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:36,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, there's this red one that talks about Dr. Mario with the yellow

1243
01:45:37,452 --> 01:45:38,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I had this magazine.

1244
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:40,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I had this.

1245
01:45:40,193 --> 01:45:44,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I had this because this is very familiar looking art to me.

1246
01:45:44,074 --> 01:45:48,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bet you this is sitting in a box in my dad's garage somewhere right now.

1247
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:50,195
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think I had at least three of these.

1248
01:45:50,195 --> 01:45:54,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure I had Fabio from Wizards and Warriors in that one too.

1249
01:45:54,156 --> 01:45:58,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And the one above this, which I can't remember what it is, but that looks very familiar to me as well.

1250
01:45:58,737 --> 01:46:00,278
[SPEAKER_05]: The other three don't look familiar.

1251
01:46:00,278 --> 01:46:01,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Those three do.

1252
01:46:01,378 --> 01:46:01,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So

1253
01:46:02,418 --> 01:46:08,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's just funny to me that these memories I have are now like in a museum digitally somewhere.

1254
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1255
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:10,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1256
01:46:12,156 --> 01:46:16,499
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can imagine, the goal of digitizing the entire archive is a lofty one.

1257
01:46:16,499 --> 01:46:20,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take them some time, but that is a goal.

1258
01:46:20,001 --> 01:46:28,766
[SPEAKER_05]: So the organization has been at this process for two years, and a lot of that has been designing the search technology and the interface platform.

1259
01:46:28,766 --> 01:46:33,189
[SPEAKER_05]: The library will be launching at some point next year and have a sampling of the catalog.

1260
01:46:33,889 --> 01:46:36,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but this, this just sounds awesome.

1261
01:46:36,511 --> 01:46:40,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, it doesn't talk about being able to necessarily play games.

1262
01:46:40,013 --> 01:46:48,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's other places you can do that, but in this collection, print magazines, design documents, audio assets, press materials, concept art.

1263
01:46:48,818 --> 01:46:50,840
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this is going to be awesome.

1264
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:55,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, kudos to the VGHF for getting involved with this.

1265
01:46:55,482 --> 01:46:58,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to that finished archive.

1266
01:46:58,204 --> 01:46:59,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1267
01:46:59,545 --> 01:47:00,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the kind of thing I eat up.

1268
01:47:01,331 --> 01:47:01,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1269
01:47:01,931 --> 01:47:03,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited too.

1270
01:47:03,012 --> 01:47:07,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like the day that opens DarkSakura, we should just do an unboxing stream.

1271
01:47:07,795 --> 01:47:10,997
[SPEAKER_05]: We just jump in there and read it together.

1272
01:47:10,997 --> 01:47:11,597
[SPEAKER_02]: We do that.

1273
01:47:11,597 --> 01:47:12,138
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do that.

1274
01:47:12,138 --> 01:47:14,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do an unboxing stream.

1275
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so it's got a very big box.

1276
01:47:19,121 --> 01:47:20,702
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1277
01:47:20,702 --> 01:47:24,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we want to invite you all to join us at the table here.

1278
01:47:24,684 --> 01:47:28,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I will admit though, my voice is wearing as the night goes on.

1279
01:47:28,366 --> 01:47:31,008
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if we're going to keep going much longer.

1280
01:47:31,008 --> 01:47:34,690
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have any questions in chat and so forth, we'll go ahead and answer those.

1281
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:41,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I will look to Loki or DarkSakura if there's any last minute stories or last things to get out here before we wrap up for the night.

1282
01:47:42,059 --> 01:47:52,143
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little thing I saw just before we went live is that Google has extended the Bluetooth conversion for Stadia controllers.

1283
01:47:52,143 --> 01:47:53,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard about that.

1284
01:47:53,104 --> 01:47:53,844
[SPEAKER_02]: To the end of 2024.

1285
01:47:53,844 --> 01:47:56,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1286
01:47:56,165 --> 01:47:59,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize there was a hard stop on that at first.

1287
01:47:59,126 --> 01:48:03,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you didn't do it by then with your controller, it was a brick at that point, basically.

1288
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:09,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I'm still kind of deciding if I want to leave mine, you know, virgin.

1289
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:11,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just just for the novelty of it.

1290
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:24,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I mean I've got other controllers that I use and as much as I was, you know, a fan of Stadia, you know, at the same time,

1291
01:48:26,532 --> 01:48:27,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1292
01:48:27,353 --> 01:48:30,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it would be like some sort of like collector's deal.

1293
01:48:30,574 --> 01:48:35,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I have a pristine controller.

1294
01:48:35,337 --> 01:48:36,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

1295
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:39,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be hard when the platform no longer exists.

1296
01:48:39,639 --> 01:48:41,400
[SPEAKER_05]: There's literally nothing.

1297
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:41,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1298
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:42,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, that's your choice.

1299
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:43,761
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your money.

1300
01:48:43,761 --> 01:48:48,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So it depends on what I probably don't really care that much about what it means to you.

1301
01:48:48,683 --> 01:48:48,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1302
01:48:51,145 --> 01:48:54,208
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, I do want to at least give the email bag a shout out.

1303
01:48:54,208 --> 01:48:59,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Participate at OrangeLingerie.com is the place to send us any emails if you want us to talk about them in a future week.

1304
01:48:59,232 --> 01:49:01,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd especially encourage this for next week.

1305
01:49:01,593 --> 01:49:07,318
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably going to be a bit of a slower news week this week, as I imagine most schools are starting their winter break this week.

1306
01:49:07,318 --> 01:49:10,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, a lot of, you know, vacation times are starting and so forth.

1307
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:12,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, maybe it is next week.

1308
01:49:12,382 --> 01:49:14,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, Loki, when are your kids on break?

1309
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:16,671
[SPEAKER_04]: GameSite Staffers Top 10

1310
01:49:34,948 --> 01:49:37,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the content that you can look forward to.

1311
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:45,174
[SPEAKER_05]: The same staffers at a very major website that wrote the most patronizing review of a video game I've ever seen and what they were talking about with Fortnite Festival.

1312
01:49:45,174 --> 01:49:54,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I get that that game has its drawbacks, and I too criticize, you know, how much they're charging for certain things, but my God, I felt like the article there was like talking to me like I was a four-year-old.

1313
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:56,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I was disgusted, quite frankly.

1314
01:49:56,181 --> 01:49:59,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just, who pissed in their cornflakes?

1315
01:50:01,204 --> 01:50:02,625
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sure it gets clicks.

1316
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:05,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And here I here I am anger talking about it.

1317
01:50:05,366 --> 01:50:07,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe it works, but I'm not naming the site.

1318
01:50:07,527 --> 01:50:09,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm not doing it.

1319
01:50:09,148 --> 01:50:10,849
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1320
01:50:10,849 --> 01:50:13,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a couple of things.

1321
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:28,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So starting off with, you know, we had talked about this in a while, but Epic Games versus Google in the whole Google Play Store thing, they won.

1322
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:32,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I heard about this.

1323
01:50:32,814 --> 01:50:42,707
[SPEAKER_04]: They won their trial basically saying that Google was participating in anti-competitive practices.

1324
01:50:42,707 --> 01:50:47,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Google was caught deleting evidence, so that's always

1325
01:50:48,581 --> 01:50:52,523
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what, that's what, you know, innocent companies do.

1326
01:50:52,523 --> 01:50:55,745
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to still go to appeals for this, but they did.

1327
01:50:55,745 --> 01:50:57,665
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why this story isn't done.

1328
01:50:57,665 --> 01:50:58,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to go up.

1329
01:50:58,746 --> 01:51:01,627
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be decided by the Supreme Court.

1330
01:51:01,627 --> 01:51:03,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in 2026.

1331
01:51:03,068 --> 01:51:08,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But funny that they, you know, lost one and won this one.

1332
01:51:08,371 --> 01:51:08,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1333
01:51:08,631 --> 01:51:09,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1334
01:51:09,011 --> 01:51:09,751
[SPEAKER_02]: It is weird.

1335
01:51:09,751 --> 01:51:11,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1336
01:51:11,052 --> 01:51:14,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It just goes to show, you know, you got to keep your stuff above the table.

1337
01:51:15,393 --> 01:51:22,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was that terrible game the day before that came out that was just an absolute piece of garbage.

1338
01:51:22,757 --> 01:51:38,066
[SPEAKER_04]: The company that put that game out, Fantastic, certainly not a... quality doesn't match the name unfortunately, they said basically that they don't have money to continue the development of the game.

1339
01:51:38,675 --> 01:51:50,727
[SPEAKER_04]: that they are basically just shutting the whole company down and it says they're working with Steam to open up refunds for any players who choose to make a refund.

1340
01:51:50,727 --> 01:51:51,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Please refund the game.

1341
01:51:51,929 --> 01:51:53,290
[SPEAKER_04]: The game doesn't work anymore.

1342
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:55,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already been delisted from Steam.

1343
01:51:55,913 --> 01:51:57,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your refund already.

1344
01:51:57,514 --> 01:51:58,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give these people any money.

1345
01:52:01,384 --> 01:52:04,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, obviously this game was like very hyped up.

1346
01:52:04,906 --> 01:52:11,470
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailers and everything made it look like much, you know, obviously way better than it was.

1347
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:14,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, this is how it ends.

1348
01:52:14,452 --> 01:52:19,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So great.

1349
01:52:19,434 --> 01:52:20,935
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

1350
01:52:20,935 --> 01:52:21,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1351
01:52:21,436 --> 01:52:30,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there is a tease, apparently, that there may be a free tier of Game Pass coming soon that's going to be supported by ads.

1352
01:52:32,523 --> 01:52:33,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'd be interesting.

1353
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:50,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I think they're mainly talking about other regions.

1354
01:52:50,490 --> 01:53:03,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, you know, they said for models like Africa or India or Southeast Asia, maybe places that aren't console first, you can say, hey, do you want to watch a 30 seconds of an ad and they get two hours of game streaming?

1355
01:53:03,972 --> 01:53:10,433
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so they're saying that because those areas don't have a lot of disposable income, that that might be an option.

1356
01:53:10,433 --> 01:53:16,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, 30 seconds of an ad for two hours of game streaming.

1357
01:53:16,934 --> 01:53:17,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Sign me up.

1358
01:53:17,655 --> 01:53:25,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, already, that's better than, like, the ad to, like, content ratio for, like, YouTube.

1359
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,923
[SPEAKER_04]: For two hours, jeez, you'd be watching probably 50 ads in that time.

1360
01:53:29,923 --> 01:53:30,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1361
01:53:30,223 --> 01:53:37,789
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, obviously, it's not going to exactly be like that, but it is interesting to see something like that.

1362
01:53:38,629 --> 01:53:39,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Neat.

1363
01:53:39,670 --> 01:53:40,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty incredible.

1364
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:42,491
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1365
01:53:42,491 --> 01:53:47,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that's going to do it for another episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1366
01:53:47,854 --> 01:53:51,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we say goodnight, I do want to thank you as always for listening to our show.

1367
01:53:51,335 --> 01:53:51,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1368
01:53:51,876 --> 01:53:55,517
[SPEAKER_05]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

1369
01:53:55,517 --> 01:54:00,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1370
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:04,943
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice 5-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show.

1371
01:54:04,943 --> 01:54:11,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes an awful long way in helping us with discoverability, so we appreciate all of that as well.

1372
01:54:11,128 --> 01:54:15,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's about all I have to say, so I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1373
01:54:15,131 --> 01:54:19,714
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I'll start with you, because I know you need to take a quick break before you start your stream.

1374
01:54:19,714 --> 01:54:24,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1375
01:54:24,738 --> 01:54:26,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't read half the news, read all the news.

1376
01:54:26,739 --> 01:54:28,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at history, and then look at all the history.

1377
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:32,362
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, have a good night.

1378
01:54:32,362 --> 01:54:34,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1379
01:54:34,903 --> 01:54:37,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, let's go to you.

1380
01:54:37,745 --> 01:54:43,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got a lot of work to do for editing.

1381
01:54:43,229 --> 01:54:45,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you always?

1382
01:54:45,911 --> 01:54:46,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Story of my life.

1383
01:54:46,711 --> 01:54:47,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1384
01:54:47,091 --> 01:54:52,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And then somewhere I need to like, I also need to get like programming time in to figure out all the

1385
01:54:52,782 --> 01:54:54,283
[SPEAKER_04]: all those playdate stuff.

1386
01:54:54,283 --> 01:54:58,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the whole idea of a golf game would be pretty cool.

1387
01:54:58,824 --> 01:55:00,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the idea of a golf game.

1388
01:55:00,265 --> 01:55:01,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should get on that.

1389
01:55:01,786 --> 01:55:02,986
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

1390
01:55:02,986 --> 01:55:06,868
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I didn't realize I wanted a playdate until you kind of talked about it last week.

1391
01:55:06,868 --> 01:55:10,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So I still have to tell my husband things I want for the holidays.

1392
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:12,030
[SPEAKER_04]: They're nice.

1393
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:13,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.

1394
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:18,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand the point of not having the backlit screen stuff because they keep down a cost.

1395
01:55:19,807 --> 01:55:21,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, do I wish it had a backlit screen.

1396
01:55:21,729 --> 01:55:25,914
[SPEAKER_04]: It is hard to view this sometimes in just normal lighting.

1397
01:55:25,914 --> 01:55:31,901
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost need that whole light attachment or whatever, like the Game Boys used to have and stuff.

1398
01:55:31,901 --> 01:55:38,328
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, I would love a Gen 2 that had just the option to backlight that thing.

1399
01:55:38,328 --> 01:55:39,189
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be great.

1400
01:55:41,387 --> 01:56:04,643
[SPEAKER_05]: um and then my final thought tonight um I don't know I'm gonna hopefully I'm feeling better I actually did do a stream on Thursday and I really shouldn't have because I think it made me regress and how I was feeling but this this whole sick has been a journey but assuming I'm feeling better this next week I do I am gonna do some more streams I've talked to Shane hopefully we're gonna be able to do a stream together doing some WoW classic together that'll be fun

1401
01:56:05,363 --> 01:56:08,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just, you know, have a ton of stuff in the backlog I'd like to keep playing.

1402
01:56:08,486 --> 01:56:10,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Fortnite 2.

1403
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:11,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And who knows what else?

1404
01:56:11,388 --> 01:56:18,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, until I get to that, I'll talk about that on social medias and all that good stuff.

1405
01:56:18,213 --> 01:56:22,997
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're here for OLR and we appreciate you being here for OLR and we hope you will be back next week.
